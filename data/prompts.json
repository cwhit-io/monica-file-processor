It should be after the music and about 25-35 mins long. Then summarize the sermon in a brief Youtube friendly summary. Start with the most compelling insight, question, or takeaway from the sermon that will immediately grab attention. Clearly articulate the main theme or biblical truth being taught. What is the pastor's central point? Extract the most practical, memorable, or profound points from the sermon. Focus on: Life applications, and Practical wisdoms. Mention the primary Bible passage(s) referenced and how they support the message. End with what the listener should do with this information - how should it change their perspective or actions? The summary should be 1-2 paragraphs and not include headers.\nYour output should be an md file that looks like this:\n\n## Sermon Title:\nTitle\n\n## Start_Time:\nHH:MM:SS\n\n## End_Time:\nHH:MM:SS\n\n## Primary Scripture:\nBOOK CHAPTER:VERSE\n\n## Summary:\nBrief Summary"
