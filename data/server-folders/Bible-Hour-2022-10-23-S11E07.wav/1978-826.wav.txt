[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=13] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=22] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=71] >> Thank you.
[time=72] You may be seated.
[time=74] Several weeks ago, a national magazine dedicated its entire issue
[time=83] to the demise of the American family.
[time=87] The purpose of the investigation was for the obtaining of answers
[time=93] to the problems that American families are facing.
[time=97] The difficulty of the problem was only matched by the dangerous nature
[time=105] of the answers that were multiplied by those who had studied the situation.
[time=109] I could not help but think as I read the pages of that newspaper
[time=116] that the answers for which men are seeking in the demise of the American home were the answers which hundreds of years ago, God had penned in a book we call the Bible.
[time=125] The answers for today were written then.
[time=130] And as we observe this day here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and here locally at his father's day, we're going to turn to the pages of the New Testament in the Book of Ephesians to hear what God has to say to the men of today.
[time=144] The title of the message is God's Message to Men.
[time=149] And I trust that you will have your hearts prepared by the music we are about to enjoy and in a few moments join us in the study of the Word of God as we listen to what God would say to us in our hearts today.
[time=162] Our special guest throughout the day here in our churches, Mr. Bill Pierce, a longtime friend of this ministry and a man who always blesses our hearts musically.
[time=171] But right now it's time for us to hear the music of our choir and they have chosen a song of victorious nature, one of the old, old hymns of the faith set in choral rendering, victory in Jesus.
[time=184] Listen as they sing now under the direction of Mr. Pete Kobe.
[time=187] [MUSIC - P. COWE, "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] [MUSIC - P. COWE, "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] [MUSIC - P. COWE, "POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE"] Oh, victory in Jesus, I say no more ever.
[time=205] He's loved me and loved me with his ringing ring blood.
[time=212] He loved me and I knew him, and the well-all is to him.
[time=220] He passed me to victory in the cleansing God.
[time=227] I heard a lot of story, how the Savior came from glory,
[time=242] how He gave us life on Calvary, who said the rest like me.
[time=249] I heard about his groaning, of his precious blood on Tony,
[time=257] and my weak engine of my Heaven won the victory.
[time=265] Oh, victory in Jesus, I say no more.
[time=271] Oh, ever, he's loved me and loved me with his ringing ring blood.
[time=281] He loved me and I knew him, and the well-all is to him.
[time=289] He passed me to victory in the cleansing God.
[time=297] Oh, you heard about his healing, of his fancy glory,
[time=304] baby, how he gave the lame, to him, and cause the blind to see.
[time=313] And then I cried in Jesus, running in my broken spirit,
[time=321] running in my God and spirit, and some loud, Jesus came and won the victory in Jesus.
[time=341] I said no more, ever, he's loved me and loved me with his ringing ring blood.
[time=351] He loved me and I knew him, and the well-all is to him.
[time=360] He punched me to victory in the cleansing God.
[time=372] Oh, ever, he loved me, loved me, loved me.
[time=398] We do have victory in Jesus Christ and in His spoken word, and this morning I would like to read for you from Ephesians 5th chapter, verses 25 through 32.
[time=411] "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for
[time=418] her, that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing by the water of the word,
[time=425] and that he might present her to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle
[time=432] or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish so out men to love
[time=438] their wives as their own bodies.
[time=441] He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[time=444] For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes it and cherishes it even as the Lord
[time=452] the church.
[time=454] For we are the members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones.
[time=459] For this cause shall man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife,
[time=466] and they too shall be one flesh.
[time=468] This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
[time=474] I've read for you this morning, Ephesians 5, 25 to 32.
[time=483] Thank you, Rick.
[time=484] We are always happy when the Lord makes it possible for our good friend, Mr. Bill Pierce, to be with us.
[time=491] Mr. Pierce is the voice of late night radio, and I'm interested to know today how many of you hear Bill Pierce on the radio late at night?
[time=500] Let me see your hands.
[time=501] Well, he's got almost as many people listening to him as our president of the auditorium today.
[time=506] Wherever you go across this country, someplace on the radio late at night you will hear the
[time=512] sterling bass voice of Bill Pierce sharing late night thoughts and music to encourage your heart.
[time=518] I suppose he has the unhappy occupation of having many people come to him and say to
[time=524] him, "You put me to sleep every night," which is not exactly what you hope to hear if you're a speaker, but in his case that's quite all right.
[time=532] God has given him a wonderful talent both vocally and instrumentally with the trombone,
[time=538] and we just want you to make him feel very much at home here today as he ministers to us throughout the day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=545] Bill will ask you to come now and share the first numbers that God has laid upon your heart as you minister to us in music today, Mr. Bill Pierce.
[time=555] Thank you.
[time=556] What a privilege it is to be back at Black Hawk to minister, and that's exactly what we're going to do, not entertain, not be a hot dog performer, but to communicate.
[time=565] In communication I understand by definition as a transfer of meaning, and we want the Lord Jesus to be the communicator, and we are merely the copper wires or whatever we might call ourselves through whom or through which he would work, and I'd like to play
[time=581] a song to begin with this morning for all of the fathers in the audience, because we need this message day by day, and with each passing moment strength I find to meet my
[time=592] trials here, trusting in my father's wise bestowment, I've no cause for worry or for fear.
[time=622] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=734] About 125 or 30 years ago, a man by the name of John Cable wrote a song using the sum 90
[time=745] million miles from our shores as his imagery, in the form of a prayer and we'd like to unearth
[time=752] it again today as a solo, son of my soul, or using to help us in the tracks, good many
[time=761] of the members of the Chicago Symphony, you'll hear prominently in this particular orchestration the sound of the French horn, played by the principal horness of the Chicago Symphony,
[time=772] Mr. Dale Klevenger, who has recently come to know Christ as his personal savior, and what a ministry he has in a very unusual and unique environment of symphony musicians, son of
[time=784] my soul, thou save your dear, it is not the night of thou art near, all may no earth born
[time=790] and cloud arise to hide thee from thy servant's eyes.
[time=803] [MUSIC]
[time=814] Son of my soul, thou save your dear, it is not night of thou art near, all may no earth
[time=835] born cloud arise to hide thee from thy servant's eyes.
[time=853] [MUSIC]
[time=862] A fight with thee from Lord Billy, or without thee I cannot live.
[time=878] A fight with thee when night is night, or without thee I dare not lie.
[time=897] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=950] Till in the ocean of thy love, we lose ourselves in heaven above.
[time=975] [MUSIC]
[time=990] We do appreciate you joining us today on the Bible Hour, and especially do we get excited about
[time=996] the opportunity we have during this particular portion of our program to move aside during the reception of the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and talk directly to those of you who are sharing the Bible Hour at home.
[time=1008] Today our special musical guest is Mr. Bill Pierce, you've already enjoyed his ministry and we're grateful for the privilege we have of sitting together and talking with him.
[time=1017] For the second time in a row, as you visited each year, we've had the chance to sit down together
[time=1023] and thank you Bill for doing the extra bit that you really don't need to do.
[time=1026] I'm honored always to be with you Pastor. We are interested in what God is doing in your life and many of the people who watch the Bible Hour as well as many of our friends here at Black Hawk are very interested in your ministry, receive it, and join with you in it.
[time=1042] I know they'd be interested in an update on what God is doing through your life and in the ministry He's given to you. The Lord has been very faithful to us in the ministry of night sounds.
[time=1051] We're on 150 stations now. Just went on Trans World Radio, which brings in the whole world to us. It's sort of interesting to see date lines of Africa, India, England, the Philippines
[time=1064] and this kind of thing. We have Trans World Radio Missionary that we support here in Bonaire and we heard about that even before you told us about it from them and they're excited about the ministry God is giving you there. We're definitely honored to be on that station.
[time=1078] Bill, your ministry is not only the late night sound of night sounds and the sharing of the ministry of Jesus Christ, but you're out in concerts almost every weekend, aren't you?
[time=1089] The concert itinerary in the radio broadcast and also a spring off from this radio ministry
[time=1095] is the stress mail we get. Say 10,000 letters, we'll get two or 3,000 border line people
[time=1101] who are really on a thin edge. How do you handle that?
[time=1105] Well, we have two ministers who are handling it for us on a part-time basis by phone,
[time=1111] so they have an immediacy there that we can't get through the radio in response or even mail.
[time=1117] We find, especially at that time of night, that there are many lonely people who are reaching out for help.
[time=1123] Most working people get to bed by 11 o'clock, but it's the ones that stay up after that who sometimes really have problems or insomnia acts. There's some pressure in their lives.
[time=1134] Bill, the last time we talked you had had an opportunity to really have a ministry with some of the professional musicians that you touch base periodically around the country,
[time=1144] and I remember when you were here the last time you had just come from a festival where you'd had the opportunity to bear a witness for Jesus Christ to some of the real greats in the music industry.
[time=1153] Is that kind of thing still happening?
[time=1155] Well, not as much as I'd like. We have been getting some clinics around the country in brass and band clinics,
[time=1162] which is always, to me, a means of evangelism, because after the techniques are discussed they begin asking you questions of why. Why do you concentrate on this particular field of music or endeavor?
[time=1173] What is there in it for you, this kind of thing?
[time=1176] Yes, I think one of the things that impresses me about the particular kind of witness that God has given you there is that it is based upon your commitment to excellence, and I think there's a lesson there for all of us as Christians, and that God can take what we will give him in excellence and use it to reach people
[time=1194] who likewise are committed to that.
[time=1196] Yeah, we've been satisfied with mediocrity in Christian work too long.
[time=1200] I think we really don't need to worship at the altar of professionalism, but need to increase our techniques and make sure that we're doing a first-rate job as a vehicle.
[time=1209] That's right, and as hard as that is and as difficult as it is, that's what we're committed to here.
[time=1215] It's the hard road, but it's the best road, and in the long run it has staying power.
[time=1220] We're excited about that.
[time=1222] Bill, one of the things that we're committed to that we're very excited about and we think that bears the stamp of excellence is a new Bible study technique that we have developed here to try to help our people at home get into the word for themselves.
[time=1234] You're no doubt familiar with the many daily Bible study guides that are available all over the country,
[time=1240] and I suppose I've studied out of one or two of them myself in my lifetime.
[time=1245] One of the things that we have found happens in just reading what somebody else has written is that there's a tendency for us not to get into the word for ourselves, and if we miss that dynamic we've missed where the power is.
[time=1257] So the purpose of this particular Bible study tool has been not to give them everything,
[time=1263] but to give them enough so that they themselves can get into the word and get what God wants to say to them.
[time=1268] And this particular thing has just been an exciting thing to us as we've heard back from people
[time=1274] who have told us they've discovered the Bible all over again.
[time=1277] And so we're making this available to all of our many television friends who watch our program today,
[time=1283] and it's this month's issue of First, Second, and Third John, and there's a special chapter there for each day for you to get into the word for yourself, answer some questions, there's a thought for the day, there's an encouragement to pray, a quotation from a book written by E.M. Bounds called Power Through Prayer, and an opportunity for you to begin to dig into God's word for yourself.
[time=1305] One of the things that I fear in a radio or television ministry is that people become dependent upon it
[time=1311] to the extent that they don't become independent students of the word of God, and I'm sure that may be true even with night sounds.
[time=1317] We can become addicted to a ministry and God wants us to be addicted to the word.
[time=1322] Oh, yes, that's true. And that happens and it's a very dangerous thing, but if we can get people to get their food right from the word of God and become addicted to the Scripture, I think God allows that kind of addiction.
[time=1335] That's the way to be on target.
[time=1337] That's right. Well, this particular book is yours this week if you will write for it, and we'd like for you to get in touch with us either by mail or through the special phone lines that we've set up to get your response to us.
[time=1348] The phone number that you should use if you'd like to have this Book of the Month study is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1356] And our Bible, our operators are there to receive your calls.
[time=1359] Just tell her that you would like to have this month's Book of the Month, and she will take your name and address, and we'll be happy to mail it to you this week.
[time=1367] If you prefer to write, you may write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1375] And for those of you who respond to us this week, we'll not only send to you the Bible, our Book of the Month, but a special little concordance called the Ready Reference Guide, which is an abbreviated concordance to help you find your way through the Bible to those verses that you'll need at a special time in your life.
[time=1392] The Book of the Month and the Ready Reference Guide are this day's special offer to our friends at home.
[time=1398] We do this as an extension of our ministry to you because we believe that God will use these tools to help you come to know Him better.
[time=1406] And we trust that the combination of the spoken word, the ministry of music, as we've heard it today from Bill Pierce, and your daily involvement in the study of the Word of God will cause you to grow and mature, that you might become more like Christ.
[time=1419] We thank you for your input to us, and we're grateful for the opportunity to have this input back to your life.
[time=1426] As Bill and I have talked about many times, television and radio can become a one-way communication, but God would have it to be a two-way communication.
[time=1435] And as we close the cycle on that communication process, the beauty of media communication can be seen, and it's exciting.
[time=1442] Thank you, Bill, for sharing this time with us.
[time=1444] Thank you, sir. I'm honored.
[time=1445] And we'll look forward to the opportunity of hearing from you again in just a few moments in our service.
[time=1449] God bless you.
[time=1458] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=1485] We want to remind all of those who are viewing this telecast in this local area that Mr. Pierce will be our special guest in the evening service, and we're beginning our service tonight at 6.30.
[time=1497] And we would invite you to come and share with us in his ministry and the ministry of the Word.
[time=1501] We have some young people we want you to see today.
[time=1504] We're proud of our young people and of their leader, Mr. Hawks, who has given them many opportunities of service and ministry and fun and fellowship.
[time=1512] Yesterday, our junior high young people participated in the area-wide Word of Life Marathon Softball Tournament.
[time=1519] And though I don't have anything good to report from the boys' involvement, they had a couple of fellows who couldn't come, and so they were short enough men to really participate.
[time=1528] We're happy to report that the junior high girls were runners up in the tournament and have earned the right to go to the regional, which will be held in just a few days in Bowling Green, to Bowling Green State University. I thought you ought to see these young people, so I've asked them if they would stand up.
[time=1544] Here is our junior high championship girls basketball team.
[time=1548] There they are, all of them right there. Thank you.
[time=1551] (Applause)
[time=1557] You knew what we had to do to get them to do that.
[time=1560] You would give us an award too.
[time=1562] (Laughter) Now we're going to ask Mr. Pierce to come back and minister to us again.
[time=1566] I know that God will speak to our hearts as he shares with us in music.
[time=1570] We have opportunity to travel around the country and meet with God's people, fellow servants such as Dr. Jeremiah.
[time=1579] Sometimes you become a hero worshiper and you just enjoy the fellowship so much you don't believe.
[time=1585] But we have to focus in on the real reason we're in action, and that is to glorify our Lord Jesus.
[time=1592] There is something very unique about him. Perhaps unique is too weak a word to use or special.
[time=1599] But as I think of Dr. Vance Havner, the old southern preacher who said of Jesus 2,000 years ago when he touched this planet,
[time=1607] he didn't come with a massage. He came with a message.
[time=1611] He didn't come to get crowds. He came to thin them out.
[time=1614] Many people thronged Jesus, but very few followed him.
[time=1619] Those who followed and those who touched were never the same again.
[time=1623] That's why this church exists, that it might lift up the Lord Jesus, who said of himself,
[time=1629] "I, if I be lifted up from this earth, will draw all men to me." We'd like to sing and play now. Bill Gather's beautiful song that speaks of the uniqueness of our Savior, Jesus.
[time=1640] There's just something about that name.
[time=1643] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, there's just something about that.
[time=1677] Master, Savior, Jesus, like the fragrance after the ray.
[time=1699] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, let all heaven and earth proclaim.
[time=1720] Kings and kingdoms will all pass away.
[time=1731] But there's something about that name.
[time=1761] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1816] Kings and kingdoms, they'll all pass away.
[time=1839] Yet there's something about this name.
[time=1866] Thank you, Bill, for your ministry to us.
[time=1869] I just thrill when God brings people of the caliber and quality of Mr. Bill Pierce to join with us.
[time=1875] It seems as if he's been on our team for a long time and we've just worked together and he prepares your heart
[time=1881] and we can come then to the Word of God, really prepared to hear what God would say to us.
[time=1886] Our Bibles are open to the passage, "Mr. Hawks read for us." A few moments ago, Ephesians 5, will not take time to look at the passage in terms of reading it again,
[time=1895] but with your Bibles open and your heart open to the Lord.
[time=1899] Let us bow our heads and our hearts and ask his blessing upon us in these moments together.
[time=1906] Father, we thank you for the Word of God, which liveeth and abideth forever, and which thou hast promised to bless with an eternal promise.
[time=1915] And we're grateful for these moments. We can come now to study the Scripture together and we can hear what God would say to us from his Word.
[time=1923] We pray especially, Father, on this particular day, for the men who will hear this message.
[time=1929] We ask that you will open their hearts, break down their defenses, keep them from turning off internally what God would say to them, and use these moments as we examine the Scripture together to enhance our lives spiritually.
[time=1946] There be those who do not know thee, who hear the sound of my voice today and the message of this particular portion of Scripture.
[time=1953] It is our prayer that they should be drawn to thee in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1958] I have preached many messages on the fifth chapter of the Book of Ephesians.
[time=1966] On occasion in the past, we have taken the time to set aside several weeks to discuss the marriage message of the Word of God, marriage in the family.
[time=1976] It has not been but just a few months ago that we had a whole series of lessons
[time=1982] from the Bible on what the Bible has to say to today's homes.
[time=1987] But as I was reading this passage again some time ago, there was a portion of the fifth chapter's instructions to the home that literally jumped out at me as if I had never seen it before.
[time=1999] And in the understanding and the reading of that particular portion of this chapter, God has opened up to me a whole new dimension of that which He would have take place in our homes today.
[time=2011] The passage about which I am speaking and the phrase which is the core of our message today to men
[time=2018] is the phrase which is found here in the fifth chapter and in the 25th verse, and it reads as follows, "Husbands, love your wives just as Christ also loved the church
[time=2031] and gave Himself up for her." Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church.
[time=2040] We're living in a day when the term love has been so distorted and maligned and misrepresented and misused that unless God would have given us a divine example
[time=2051] and a pattern to follow, we would be lost in the sea of meaninglessness that is all around us as it relates to the term love.
[time=2059] If I were to ask all of you to take a moment and write down on a sheet of paper what you understand by the term love, I would be I am certain, not surprised to find that many of you had written down something akin to that which comes to us by way of the media today to destroy God's real message of love in the Bible.
[time=2081] But we need not get lost in any of these detours.
[time=2084] We need not get to fogged out when it comes to the message of love if we will take as God has given to us the divine example that He would put before us.
[time=2094] He says, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church." If we could just grasp that phrase and all of the meaning that is tied up in it, we could shut down much of the demise of the American home, which we mentioned at the outset of our ministry today.
[time=2111] Husbands, love your wives.
[time=2114] I'd like to suggest to you men that there are three good reasons why you ought to listen to that command.
[time=2119] First of all, God's message to men and His pattern of your love for your wife after the love of Christ for His church is important to you for what it will do for you.
[time=2128] If you will learn what God would say to you from the Word of God concerning your love relationship at home with your wife, you will be a happier man, a better man, a more usable man in the hands of God.
[time=2141] Secondly, I'd like to suggest that you listen to God's message to you today for what it will do for your wife.
[time=2147] She's been waiting all along for me to preach this message, and she's been praying all along that you would listen to what I'd say.
[time=2153] And if you will take to heart what God wonderfully shares with you in the Word of God,
[time=2159] it will make you a different person, and it will make your wife a different person.
[time=2164] But I want to say to you thirdly, and certainly not least of all, not last in importance,
[time=2170] I want to say to you that you ought to listen to what God would say to you today in this message because of what it will do for your children.
[time=2177] Someone wrote that the most important thing that a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
[time=2186] And I believe that's true.
[time=2188] I believe that the most important thing you can do for those little ones that are growing up in your home is to understand the relationship God expects of you to the woman you married.
[time=2198] And so I suggest to you that what he would teach us today is important for you, it's important for your wife, and it's vitally important for your children.
[time=2206] Now the Bible says that this love were to have for our wives in our home is the kind of love that Christ had for his church.
[time=2214] And first of all, I want to suggest to you that that involves a key word, and that word is commitment.
[time=2220] There are four key words I want to share with you in this passage.
[time=2223] The first one is the word commitment.
[time=2226] Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for it.
[time=2232] As I thought about this in relationship to what the Word of God teaches concerning Christ and His love for the church, I was overwhelmed to think back through the history of the relationship of Christ and His church and compare it to the relationship we're to have at home.
[time=2247] The Bible tells us that before the foundation of the world, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit set their love upon the church.
[time=2254] He loved us and chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.
[time=2258] The book of Ephesians traces the history of His love for the church and reminds us that the church was bought with the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and washed and cleansed to be His.
[time=2269] The Bible teaches us that even though the church rejected Christ and as we study church history and follow the history of the church through the medieval ages and see the dark ages of the church, we can revel in the fact that even though the church often turned her back upon Jesus Christ,
[time=2286] she nonetheless was the object of His love.
[time=2291] And His commitment to love the church has never waned or waxed one moment even though the church has battled and be lagged what Christ would do for the church.
[time=2303] The church has been divided and broken.
[time=2305] It has resisted the love of Christ and yet Christ continues to love.
[time=2311] I find as I talk with people who are experiencing problems in their home that one of the things that's most needed is a commitment.
[time=2318] It's a word which has been lost in our modern marriages.
[time=2321] I talk to men who discuss marriage as if it were something they're going to try for a while, and if it doesn't work they'll try something else.
[time=2328] I was reading this week a report of a book that was written, and all of you are familiar with it, for it revolutionized the marriages and homes of our country,
[time=2338] a book entitled "Open Marriage" by George and Nina O'Neill.
[time=2343] It came from the pit of hell and should go back there as fast as it can.
[time=2347] It is a book which has destroyed more marriages than it ever hopes to help.
[time=2351] Recently in the Washington Post, a secular commentator made this report on what that book has done in American society today.
[time=2360] Understand now this is not from the pit of a Christian.
[time=2363] He wrote these words, "Open Marriage" by George and Nina O'Neill was a book for the times,
[time=2369] and it said over and over again that you should be honest, straight, out front, give space, let the other person do their thing, communicate, and if you wanted to have an affair, for God's sake, do be honest about it.
[time=2382] Don't sneak around, make excuses, call late in the afternoon with some story about work.
[time=2387] Simply pick up the phone and say, "Honey, I'll be a bit late tonight, I'm going to have an affair." That's what the book taught.
[time=2393] But there were these couples I knew said this writer.
[time=2396] They were open, they were honest, they were having affairs, they were not sneaking around, they were not lying, they were being honest, they were being open.
[time=2405] Everyone agreed, it was wonderful.
[time=2407] The men agreed, and the women agreed, and I agreed, and it all made you wonder.
[time=2412] Then they split.
[time=2414] There was something wrong.
[time=2416] Invariably, someone couldn't take it.
[time=2419] It had nothing to do with the head, says this writer.
[time=2422] The head understood, it was the heart.
[time=2424] It was, you should pardon the expression, heartbroken.
[time=2429] "It all made you think," said Richard Cohen.
[time=2433] "It made you think that maybe there are things we still don't know about men and women, and maybe before we spit in the eye of tradition, we ought to know what we're doing." I have some theories, and one of them is that one of the ways you measure love is not with words, but with actions, with commitment, and with what you are willing to give up,
[time=2453] and what you are willing to share with no one else, commitment.
[time=2459] As I look at our Christian homes, and I look at the homes that I'm aware of, one of the things that I see being pulled out of the fabric of modern marriages is this very thing, commitment.
[time=2469] The commitment that God calls us to as He relates our relationship at home to the relationship of Christ to the church, an unqualified commitment that says even as the marriage vows say, "For better or for worse, I have set my love upon that woman, and I will love her to the end." That's not true anymore.
[time=2488] Men that I know who claim to be Christians have given up the commitment in their marriage.
[time=2495] Men that I know who minister and pulpits have softened their approach on commitment.
[time=2501] I know the brokenness in our homes today, and I understand that and have a compassionate heart, and I trust that God will help me to have a ministry there, but I want to go on record as saying today, I believe that God's plan of one man for one woman is exactly what he meant, and that takes commitment.
[time=2522] Some time ago on a TV talk show, the Latin American movie actor Ricardo Montoban
[time=2529] was confronted with a challenge.
[time=2532] He said, the man said to him as he was interviewing me, he said, "I know that Latin's are great lovers, and you have a reputation of being a great screen lover." He said, "Let me ask you, what makes a great lover?" And of course, the announcer, as they often do, was baiting him, hoping to get some off-color comment from him on the air.
[time=2550] You should have seen the shock in his face when Ricardo responded, and I quote, "A great lover is a man who can satisfy a woman all of his life and be satisfied by one woman all of his life.
[time=2563] A great lover is not someone who goes from woman to woman, any dog can do that." And he was right.
[time=2572] I want to say to you, people, as you hear my voice today, that I believe God has called us to commitment in our marriages.
[time=2578] And men, I don't know what your pattern of life is or what your habits are, but I'll tell you this, if God gave you a woman, he expects you to be committed and faithful to her, and you cannot be the kind of man God wants you to be if you don't commit yourself to that pattern of life.
[time=2594] The first key word is commitment.
[time=2596] Let me say to you that commitment involves two practical things.
[time=2599] You'll find them in the 28th verse.
[time=2601] "Husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
[time=2605] He who loves his own wife loves himself." I don't have time to talk much about this, but I want to say to you that when you're committed to your wife, what it will mean is, first of all, you'll be sensitive to her needs.
[time=2617] The Bible says that you're committed in the same way you're committed to your body.
[time=2620] I want you to know we're all committed to our bodies, aren't we?
[time=2623] We get a little sniffle and we run for the medicine cabinet.
[time=2626] We have a little hurt and we try to get something to fix it.
[time=2629] We're always taking care of our needs.
[time=2631] Most of us don't go out in the middle of the winter with light clothing on so that we catch coal.
[time=2636] We're always carrying and taking care of our bodies.
[time=2639] The Bible says that's what you ought to do if you're committed to your wife.
[time=2642] We're not only interested in ministering to the needs of our own body, but we also care for the hurts of our body.
[time=2649] The Bible says that just as we care for our own bodies by ministering to the needs of our body and caring for the hurts of our body, we as men who are committed to our wives are to minister to the needs of our wife and we're to help heal the hurts of our wife.
[time=2664] Surprising how many men come to sit in a counseling session
[time=2670] and they find out their wife is hurting and discover that for the first time in front of the counselor.
[time=2675] It's obvious that they have no knowledge of where their wife is living and how badly she needs them to be ministering to the hurts of her life.
[time=2685] The first key word men is the word commitment and I challenge you today to reexamine your commitment to your marriage, to your home, to your wife, to that to which God has called you.
[time=2694] This is a good day for you to review that.
[time=2697] The second key word is the word sacrifice.
[time=2701] Sacrifice. There is no such thing as a good marriage without sacrifice.
[time=2706] The Bible says that when Jesus Christ loved the church, the literal rendering of the text is He gave Himself up for the church.
[time=2715] Do you know what makes a good marriage?
[time=2717] A marriage is made by two people who continually give themselves up, one to the other.
[time=2722] The sense of sacrifice.
[time=2725] Now, there are two aspects of the sacrifice that are mentioned here in the text.
[time=2729] First of all, He gave Himself up.
[time=2732] But secondly, He gave Himself up for a specific purpose.
[time=2736] And there's a key phrase I would emblazon in your heart today, men, it's this.
[time=2740] He gave up His life to sanctify the church.
[time=2744] And you can put it in terms of your own home by putting it in this phrase.
[time=2748] God wants you to give up your life to sanctify your wife.
[time=2753] Now, what does that mean?
[time=2755] Well, one of the things that happens when we get involved in the relationship of marriage is that there is a contest that is put into operation.
[time=2764] We have our rights and our wife has her rights.
[time=2767] And sooner or later, there's got to be a meeting of the minds.
[time=2771] You've heard I'm certain me say in the past that some folks believe that marriage is made up of 50% of the husband's rights and 50% of the wife's rights and the blending of those two together.
[time=2782] But the problem with that formula is that there's still 50% left over on each side and it doesn't work.
[time=2788] What makes a marriage is a man giving up 100% of himself to his wife and the wife giving up 100% of herself to the husband and there's a blending of that sacrificial spirit that is a beautiful thing to see.
[time=2802] All of us remember as we first got married what a struggle it was to relieve ourselves of the intense, independent spirit that we had developed growing up.
[time=2811] And I can tell you some stories about that in my own personal experience but I've chosen not to do that today.
[time=2817] I'm certain if you would like to talk to my wife about that she could relate some of those early struggles.
[time=2823] The spirit of sacrifice.
[time=2825] Now the sacrifice involves being willing to be vulnerable to your mate, being willing to be hurt at times, being willing to give up anything you are and have so that you might help to meet her needs.
[time=2837] And as long as it's happening from both sides of the relationship it will always work and there will never be the misuse of that principle.
[time=2845] But the Bible says that Christ gave up himself for the church that he might sanctify it.
[time=2852] That means to set it apart, to make it holy.
[time=2855] I've never really understood that in these terms before but the Bible says men that we are to continually give up ourselves that we might help to set our wives apart unto God.
[time=2866] We must have as our purpose in life the realization that God expects us to be the sanctifier or the setter apart of or the making holy of our wives.
[time=2877] He has called us to give ourselves up that we might make her all that God wanted her to be.
[time=2884] That is not only true in the spiritual realm, that's true in every aspect of the realm.
[time=2889] We as individuals and as fundamentalists have so reacted against the liberation movement that it's almost to the point we've gone to the other extreme.
[time=2896] I believe that a woman is liberated within the marriage as God gives her the freedom to be herself in that relationship.
[time=2903] In fact I'll go a little farther and say I don't believe a woman is ever liberated until she's in the marriage relationship as God wants her to be.
[time=2911] But when she's in that relationship as husbands we need to be giving ourselves up so that that woman we love can be all that God wants her to be in her whole life that she can be developed in every aspect of her living and that takes sacrifice in the part of a man.
[time=2926] I know some men that won't give up one golf game a week so that their wife can go and experience some things in her own life that she needs for her own personal development.
[time=2935] That's a selfish spirit and that's not the spirit of this passage of Scripture.
[time=2939] There's a sense of sacrifice that God calls us to if we're to minister to our wives.
[time=2943] That's the second key word.
[time=2945] Thirdly, and I must hasten on there's the word tenderness.
[time=2949] And I've chosen these words from this passage of Scripture not only because they're here but because I sense as I talk to people in today's world that these are the areas where we're missing it men.
[time=2960] These are the areas where we're not ministering as we ought to.
[time=2963] Will you notice that the Scripture tells us in the 29th verse of this chapter that we are to nourish and cherish our wives just as we nourish and cherish our own bodies and as Christ nourishes and cherishes the church.
[time=2978] Now the words nourish and cherish men are words of great tenderness.
[time=2984] They are not the words of athletic involvement.
[time=2990] They're the words that come basically right out of the nursery room.
[time=2995] Just as a mother nourishes and cherishes the little baby in her arms, the Bible uses the same terms to describe the relationship of a man to his wife.
[time=3005] He is to nourish and cherish her.
[time=3007] Now the word nourish means that you're to be careful and faithful in supplying her needs, both bodily needs, food and clothing and caring that she is in a protective environment.
[time=3019] That's how you nourish her.
[time=3021] But I want to zero in for a moment on the word cherish.
[time=3024] The word cherish means to be warm and tender.
[time=3032] I don't know how some of you women live with the men you're married to if they treat you in private the way I've seen some of them treat you in public.
[time=3040] I don't know how you stand it.
[time=3043] Just bowl over you like you weren't there.
[time=3045] Treat you as a non-person.
[time=3047] God help the man that treats his wife like that.
[time=3050] If you have come the conclusion if the man treats his wife like that in public, he probably treats her worse in private.
[time=3056] God has not called you to run over your wife men.
[time=3060] He has not called you to just misuse her and abuse her and act as if she wasn't a person.
[time=3066] He's called you to a sense of tenderness and respect.
[time=3069] Someone wrote recently, "Shivalry is not dead, but it's mighty sick." They were right.
[time=3076] Now I don't expect that you have to open the door for every day.
[time=3079] I'm in trouble if that's what we have to do.
[time=3082] You understand what I'm talking about?
[time=3084] That woman is the woman God gave you.
[time=3086] She's the one you committed your life to.
[time=3088] She's the one you love and you are a treater that way.
[time=3091] And that involves a tenderness in your approach to her.
[time=3095] So that when others see you together, they get the impression that you love her and that you respect her and that she's very important to you.
[time=3103] Nourish and Cherish.
[time=3106] In the past two years I've had the unhappy privilege and I want to say gladly that there are not folks from this church of trying to minister to a woman who was badly beaten and bruised by her husband with her eyes blackened
[time=3122] the possibility of some broken bones.
[time=3125] Some men get a masochistic thrill out of destroying the body of their wife.
[time=3129] We ought to teach our sons as they're growing up, man.
[time=3131] This is a digression that it's never right to hit a woman ever.
[time=3135] My son knows that.
[time=3137] He's learned that the hard way.
[time=3139] Never right to hit a girl.
[time=3141] He says, Daddy, what do I do if Jan hits me?
[time=3143] Listen, you come and tell me and we'll take care of that, but don't you ever hit your sister?
[time=3148] Never right for a man to hit a woman.
[time=3151] Sometimes I think our men are taught that as they're growing up, that it's okay.
[time=3156] The Bible says men are to treat their women with tenderness.
[time=3160] Cherish.
[time=3162] Lastly, and I've left this last because I don't want to spend much time on.
[time=3165] This is the one thing men seem to know more about this text than anything else, and that is that God has called you fourthly, and this is the fourth key word to leadership.
[time=3173] If I ask you men today, what's the part of this passage you like the best?
[time=3176] It's that part that says husband, you're to be the head of your wife.
[time=3179] You all know that.
[time=3181] And I've left that for the last because I don't have to do much work there.
[time=3184] You all know about that.
[time=3186] But you know what leadership is?
[time=3189] The Bible says that leadership means responsibility.
[time=3194] I don't hear men saying that too much.
[time=3197] Just as Christ was the head of the body and became the one responsible for the well-being of that body,
[time=3203] so the man who is the head of his home will be sensing his responsibility for the well-being of that home.
[time=3210] It will not be a lording over his wife or a dictatorial spirit over his wife,
[time=3217] but it will be seen in the way that that home and that woman responds to him because they respect his leadership and his ability to guide the good courtship in the direction it ought to go.
[time=3229] Leadership.
[time=3231] Four key words.
[time=3233] Commitment.
[time=3235] Sacrifice.
[time=3237] Tenderness.
[time=3239] And leadership.
[time=3241] Gentlemen, if you put those four things into practice in your home, it'll be the best thing this side of heaven.
[time=3248] And you'll have a wife who will respond.
[time=3251] And you'll have a family that will grow in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[time=3255] And we can shut down the demise of the Christian home.
[time=3260] Shall we pray?
[time=3263] Father, we ask that you will take these few moments that we have spent together.
[time=3269] Help us to understand that what you've called us to do is not an option.
[time=3274] We recognize that the old nature is present with us.
[time=3278] Help us to understand that if we feed the new nature, it will dominate the old and we can be what you want us to be.
[time=3284] My heart goes out today to the men of our fellowship who needed for God to speak to them today in a very specific way.
[time=3295] And I pray that you will use these straightforward words from the Scripture to encourage and strengthen each of us as men today.
[time=3305] And we'll give you the praise in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=3311] We're going to sing together a hymn of invitation. And I'm going to ask that you turn to your hymnbook, hymn number 562.
[time=3320] And I'm going to ask that we keep this.
