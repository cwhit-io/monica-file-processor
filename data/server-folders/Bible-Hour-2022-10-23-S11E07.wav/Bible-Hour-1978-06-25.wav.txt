[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=21] [MUSIC]
[time=51] [ Singing ]
[time=74] >> Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=76] [ Pause ] Almost every week, somebody writes a new book on love.
[time=86] Unfortunately, most of the books that are written on the subject are written about a subject far different than the subject of love as it is given to us in the Bible.
[time=97] I'm grateful to say today that the last word has been spoken on love.
[time=102] That's right.
[time=103] The last word has been written on love.
[time=106] There is no more that we can learn about love, true love, than what God has written in His word, the Bible.
[time=114] Today, we're going to look at a passage of Scripture that will help us to examine whether or not we have become mature in our love.
[time=121] Three evidences of mature love.
[time=124] And I trust that your hearts and your Bibles will be open in a few moments as we turn to the Scriptures to share together God's Word to us today.
[time=132] First of all, we have some good music.
[time=134] We have some special guests.
[time=135] We'll want you to meet in a few moments.
[time=137] This is the time of the year when we give our thoughts here at the Black Alt Baptist Church to the freedom that we have as Americans.
[time=145] Every year around the 4th of July, we have a special patriotic presentation.
[time=150] Hundreds of people come from all over this area to share with us as we salute the country that gives us the privilege and the right of worshiping together.
[time=159] And our choir is going to share with us some of the music of America as they sing for us now one of the great American hymns.
[time=166] I trust that it will stir the patriotic blood in each of your veins as you give thanks to the Lord now for the privilege of being an American.
[time=189] [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=368] This morning I would like to read for you from God's Word the Gospel of John chapter 15 verses 1 through 7.
[time=377] I am the true vine and my Father is the vine dresser.
[time=382] Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he takeeth away, and every branch that bear fruit,
[time=389] he pruneth it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[time=393] Now you are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.
[time=397] Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine.
[time=405] No more can ye accept you abide in me.
[time=409] I am the vine and you are the branches.
[time=413] He that abideeth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[time=419] Forth out me you can do nothing.
[time=422] If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered.
[time=428] And men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.
[time=433] If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you.
[time=441] I have read for you this morning John 15 verses 1 through 7.
[time=446] Thank you Rick.
[time=452] We want to express a word of appreciation to all of our many friends who have participated in these recent days in a special television project that has been ours during this month.
[time=462] We trust you will continue to pray during these closing days of this particular fun drive that God will meet our need as he has promised to do.
[time=470] We do appreciate every one of you that have had a part in making this ministry continually possible to the many who share with us in the Bible hours ministry in the homes all over this area.
[time=481] One of the strategic parts of the ministry of television and one of the enjoyable and exciting parts
[time=488] of the ministry of this church is the ministry of music.
[time=491] And the core of the music program in the local church ministry here is a group of young couples,
[time=497] young individuals who make up the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=501] If you have chosen a song to share with us today about the lordship of Jesus Christ, please listen carefully to the words as they minister to our hearts right now.
[time=531] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=655] We thank you for joining us on today's edition of the Bible Hour,
[time=661] and we especially appreciate the fact that you take time out of your schedule to sit down and enjoy the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour staff as we come into your home each week.
[time=673] And Donna, we have some things that we're especially thankful for today as we have been in this special fun drive for the television ministry, and I know that there's a special group of people that you'd like to express yourself to this morning.
[time=686] It's been so thrilling for us to open a mail each day and to read the many letters that we receive from our senior saints as we like to refer to them.
[time=696] Many people who write to us tell us that they are on pension, on social security, and aren't able to give very much, and many of them only send us one dollar, but it's all the little gifts put together that really add up, and to read your letters and know that you're willing to sacrifice in order to have the Bible Hour come into your home is very meaningful to us.
[time=715] I don't think we could say that any too strongly, because there are times, are there not, when we realize the tremendous burden and responsibility, and sometimes the problems and difficulties associated with the media ministry.
[time=729] There are times when, if we're not careful, Satan can sow seeds of doubt in our minds, and we wonder, really is it worth it when it takes so much?
[time=737] And then we get letters from people like the letters we've received this week from so many of our dear elderly friends, and we recognize how much they depend on it and how much they're willing to sacrifice to make sure that it continues in their area.
[time=751] I shared with our people in a Wednesday night service recently that if we could develop within each of our hearts the same spirit of sacrifice in all of the people who watch, as that which is evident in our older people who watch, there never would be a need in the television ministry.
[time=767] We wouldn't even have to write any letters to folks to encourage them.
[time=771] We just want to thank all of you who've had a part in this present, a project for the renewal of our station contracts, and in just a few days we'll be having a report to share with you how we're doing.
[time=782] We still have a long way to go as of this television date, but I really believe God is going to meet this need through the many friends that he's raised up who are a part of the Bible Hour Television Ministry.
[time=793] And once again, I want to express my appreciation, along with that of Donnas, to our special people who have helped us in this fun driving, then one word to another group of special folks, and that is our Founders Club members.
[time=807] Founders Club are a group of people who support us monthly.
[time=810] That is, each month, whether we request it or not, they send in a special gift, and done a much of the special giving for our project during the summer has come from our Founders Club members who were already giving regularly.
[time=823] And so we thank you.
[time=824] It is your help and your support during these days that makes it possible for the Bible Hour to continue its ministry on every station.
[time=832] Please pray during these days. That's one thing everyone can do.
[time=836] That's right. In fact, I had one lady call me this week at home, and she said, "There's just no way that I can give any more money than what I'm already giving to the Bible Hour each month.
[time=845] But I'm going to commit to you that I'm going to pray every day for an extra length of time for the need that you have." And only God knows how much that is worth in terms of the continuation of the ministry
[time=857] of the Bible Hour. One of the ministries that we are so excited about that extends the Bible Hour and stretches it out almost over the whole week instead of it just being a Sunday program is the ministry of our Book of the Month Bible Studies.
[time=873] Donna, we've just been so grateful to the many who have involved themselves in that study.
[time=878] You've got a letter this week that I think you ought to read in reference to one of the recent Bible Study Ministries.
[time=884] This lady writes to us and she says, "I appreciate the Book of the Month's study guides as I share one with my daughter. I have become more enlightened about the scriptures, and in my study I recall studies I had years ago.
[time=898] I enjoy studying the Bible and learning more of God's will for his people." And Donna, we want to make the study guide available to everyone who is watching the telecast today.
[time=909] Without any charge or obligation, the particular study guide we're offering right now is the study of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John.
[time=916] It is a daily Bible study program that takes you into a selected passage of Scripture each day
[time=922] with questions for you to answer right from the Bible.
[time=925] And then there are some other features too.
[time=928] After you answer the questions down at the bottom there's an encouragement to pray.
[time=932] And then there's a little quote that encourages you in that day living as to how you can live for the Lord.
[time=939] It's sort of an illustration and you know my love for illustrations.
[time=942] A little story and anecdote to sort of help people understand one particular part of the passage.
[time=947] And then in the middle of the book there is an envelope with a little schedule on it and the schedule of the envelope, perhaps I can hold it up, has a place for you to check off each day's assignment.
[time=958] It sort of makes you accountable to yourself to study every single day.
[time=963] Most of us can get up the energy to study once in a while, but it is the daily regular consistent study of the Word of God that means so much.
[time=971] And I think if we can just get people to do that, what a tremendous benefit it will be to their own lives.
[time=976] Now Donna, how can people get a hold of this particular study guide for their own spiritual lives?
[time=981] There are two ways that you may contact us.
[time=984] Probably the easiest and most convenient is for you to just pick up your phone and call 1-800-247-2160
[time=992] and ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like the materials offered on today's broadcast.
[time=998] The other way which you may contact us is by mail and you need to write to pastor David Jeremiah,
[time=1004] post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1009] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1012] We don't care particularly how you contact us, but it is vital that we do hear from you.
[time=1017] Donna, you do that so well and we want to remind you that when you call or write this week,
[time=1023] when you ask for the book of the month, we will automatically send you another Bible study tool
[time=1029] to accompany that called the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=1032] If you've watched any recent telecast, we don't have to say too much about that, but this little concordance will be an added tool for you as you study the Bible each day.
[time=1042] How does it work Donna?
[time=1044] You have a question on a particular subject or if you're facing a problem in your life.
[time=1048] Perhaps you need assurance of your salvation.
[time=1051] You open up the little booklet and look under assurance and it gives you a number of verses that you can look up in the Bible for yourself and find the answer to your problem.
[time=1059] So the Ready Reference Guide and the Book of the Month Study Guide and of course the Bible
[time=1065] gives you the three tools you need to expand the Bible Hours Ministry into your life
[time=1071] every single day of the week so that we're praying across the country, wherever the Bible Hour program is heard, wherever people watch our television program, we can establish them in a daily Bible study habit.
[time=1082] Wouldn't it be a tremendous thing to think of hundreds and hundreds of Christians all over who each day are studying the Word of God?
[time=1089] I want to remind you again that these study tools for your personal Bible study are available to you today by simply calling 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1100] 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1103] This is a free call from any place where you happen to hear my voice.
[time=1107] Be sure you ask for the Bible Hour operator when you make your call.
[time=1111] Or of course we'd be glad to hear from you in the mail.
[time=1114] Simply write to me Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250-Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1121] Whether you write or call, you're getting in touch with us this week.
[time=1125] We'll not only make it possible for us to send you these free materials, but we'll be a great encouragement to each and every one of us as we share together the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=1135] May God richly bless you as you continue to share the Bible Hour program today.
[time=1159] [MUSIC]
[time=1189] We are so thankful for the missionaries that God has given to us.
[time=1207] And I've moved around among a number of churches in our generation, and I personally believe we've got the greatest collection of missionaries you'll find any place anywhere.
[time=1216] Some of the first missionaries that we began to support were Boyd and Kathy Griffith, who serve the Lord in the beautiful island of Bonair, Netherlands, and Tilly's with Transworld Radio.
[time=1228] Boyd is in charge of much of the music that goes out into the many cultures that are reached by missionary radio.
[time=1233] They're home on furlough now, and they're here with us throughout today, and they're going to participate in the ministry of television and the ministry and the Word of God today through one of their children, Sanja, S-O-N-J-A, Sanja Griffith.
[time=1250] And she's going to sing for us now, a song entitled, "The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power."
[time=1256] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=1353] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1367] Well, he's training his troops for the future.
[time=1369] You can see that some day you'll turn on about 800 on the radio dial where you can pick up bone air on occasion even here in the United States.
[time=1377] And you'll hear the beautiful voice of Sanja Griffith coming through the airwaves from the island where her father is head of the music in Transworld Radio.
[time=1385] I'm going to ask Boyd to stay here close by and have him come and lead us in prayer before the message in just a few moments.
[time=1391] Right now we have some more music that we want to share with you.
[time=1394] A song from the voice of one of our Black Hawk singers who shares with us often in the Ministry of Music, Beth Brunky.
[time=1401] And she's reminding us of a great doctrinal truth that we've been studying in the book of 1 John.
[time=1405] And that truth is this. Jesus. He's the Son of God.
[time=1411] [MUSIC]
[time=1423] [MUSIC] They suddenly crystal. As a man came through the entrance of the city [MUSIC] As he touched and healed the blind man [MUSIC]
[time=1462] [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, the precious Son of God [MUSIC] When it was the share of hate was that meant for you [MUSIC]
[time=1501] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=1527] [MUSIC] Yes, he brought a better way as he spoke [MUSIC] Later I used to be in this way [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, he is the Son of God [MUSIC]
[time=1566] [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, he is everything to me [MUSIC] Yes, he's all the world to me [MUSIC] A miracle called and the sky turned the left as they nailed him to the tree [MUSIC] Mary died for every man and every country [MUSIC] But the price he paid and the blood he shed is changing lives today [MUSIC] And with joy and praise you can hear the people pray [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, he is the Son of God [MUSIC]
[time=1651] [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, he is everything to me [MUSIC] Yes, he's all the world to me [MUSIC] Jesus ♪
[time=1692] There is something special about the name of Jesus, and if you know him as your personal savior, you know that intuitively
[time=1698] without even being reminded about it. Before we open the Word of God today, I'm going to ask Boyd Griffith,
[time=1704] who is our missionary in bone air if he would come and lead us to the throne of grace and prayer.
[time=1708] For those of you who are part of our local assembly here, he'll be sharing with us in the evening service tonight.
[time=1713] I'd like for him just to come and lead us in prayer and ask God's blessing upon our time in the Word of God today.
[time=1720] Let's pray. Our Father in Heaven, we thank you this morning for the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1727] Lord, we thank you for the miracle of television, for the miracles that we are experiencing in these last days.
[time=1734] We thank you, Lord, that your Word is powerful and quick, that your Word convinces us, convicts us.
[time=1741] Thank you, Father, for this church and the testimony this church has throughout the world now.
[time=1746] Thank you for this morning that you've given us to worship you, to praise you in song. Thank you for the marvelous name of Jesus.
[time=1754] We pray that we may be impressed, Lord, today with the name of Christ.
[time=1758] We pray that you'll reach out through this modern medium to many, many needy hearts, people in motel rooms, people who are lonely, people who are needy.
[time=1767] And may the Word of God accomplish great things in life today as Pastor Jeremiah brings the Word of God.
[time=1773] We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1779] I'm speaking today from the fourth and fifth chapters of the book of 1 John, and if you have your Bibles, I trust that you will turn with me to 1 John chapter 4, where I want to begin my reading this morning with the 17th verse.
[time=1792] 1 John chapter 4 and verse 17.
[time=1797] And the Word of God reads as follows, 1 John 4 17.
[time=1801] Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world.
[time=1811] There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment.
[time=1818] He that fearth is not made perfect in love. We love him because he first loved us.
[time=1825] Now if a man say I love God and hated his brother, he is a liar, for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
[time=1833] how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
[time=1836] And this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love also his brother, whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone that loveth him that begat,
[time=1847] loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[time=1850] By this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandments.
[time=1858] The Bible tells us that it is possible for us to know when we have matured in love.
[time=1864] The key phrase in the text is in the 17th verse of the 4th chapter where we read these words.
[time=1869] Hereby we know or herein we know we have been perfected in love.
[time=1875] Now the word perfect here is a word which does not have to do with an absolute standard or nature,
[time=1882] but it has to do with maturity. We could paraphrase that phrase in the 17th verse of the 4th chapter by saying it this way.
[time=1890] Hereby we know that we have grown up in love or that we have come to a place of maturity in love.
[time=1898] And then the apostle John who is the apostle of love goes in detail in the next few verses to set down for us three different proofs of mature love.
[time=1909] He is talking here about the love that we have from God that goes out from us to other men and he says it's possible to know whether you have matured in God's kind of love.
[time=1920] Herein is love made perfect. This love is a love which develops and produces a certain kind of fruit.
[time=1928] And as you look into your life you will examine your life to see whether that fruit is there.
[time=1933] And if it is there the Bible says you are in the maturing process of God's love.
[time=1939] The three basic things that John is going to say to us from this text is this.
[time=1945] Number one if we have mature love there will be boldness before God in the judgment day.
[time=1952] Number two if we have mature love there will be brotherly love for those around us.
[time=1958] Number three if we have mature love it will affect the behavior that we exhibit in our lives as we live from day to day.
[time=1967] There are three key words that we are going to examine. First of all if we have God's kind of love it will produce boldness within us.
[time=1975] Secondly if we have God's kind of love it will develop into a brotherly love for those who are in God's family.
[time=1982] Thirdly if we have God's kind of love it will affect our behavior the way that we live.
[time=1988] Now let's begin as we examine together love's perfection.
[time=1992] First of all the Bible tells us that God's love is evidenced in our life by boldness.
[time=1998] The word is found in the seventeenth verse here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.
[time=2007] This is the third time in first John that the writer uses the word boldness.
[time=2012] And the word means to have freedom of speech to have fearless confidence before someone.
[time=2019] And John is telling us that when we have matured love within us from God it will give to us a freedom of speech before God a lack of fear and a holy boldness in his presence.
[time=2032] The time of our boldness according to the text is in the day of judgment.
[time=2036] The time when we shall all give an account to God.
[time=2040] The time when we shall all give an answer for the things done in the body.
[time=2044] The time when we shall stand before the righteous holy judge of all of the universe who has the ability to look down deep within our souls and see us for what we are.
[time=2055] And the Bible says if we have matured love in that day we can stand there with boldness.
[time=2061] Someone has written that the only anxieties that men experience today are the anxieties that are in their hearts because they are afraid that someone will find out what they really are at the core of their life.
[time=2073] What an awful way to live filled with anxiety that you are afraid you will be found out.
[time=2079] The Bible says when God's love is perfected in us there is no anxiety, there is no fear there is simply a boldness before him.
[time=2088] And the 17th verse and in the last part of the verse we have the reason for our boldness.
[time=2094] He says we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world.
[time=2101] Now I am sure that many of you have seen that last phrase printed on placards in different places throughout Christendom.
[time=2107] I have looked at that many times in my Christian experience wondering what exactly could be meant by that phrase.
[time=2114] For as I examine my life and as I have the opportunity to give cursor examination to the lives around me I will have to admit that it is not true to say as he is so am I in the world.
[time=2126] I don't have his kind of love as I ought to. I don't have his kind of holiness as I ought to.
[time=2132] I don't have his kind of power as that. It isn't really true in the absolute sense of the word for me to say as he is so am I in the world.
[time=2141] Then I begin to realize that the last part of 17 is related to the first part of 17 and it has really made a great deal of difference in my understanding of the phrase.
[time=2151] The scripture says as he is so am I in the world in what respect in the respect of judgment.
[time=2159] The scripture says that as I am related to Christ who is the Son of God and as the Son of God is related to the Father who is the righteous judge as he is so am I in the world.
[time=2171] That means that when someday I stand before God and the love of God has been perfected in my heart I have nothing to fear because as he is so am I.
[time=2180] I am joined here with Jesus Christ a part of the family of God and I have nothing to fear from the righteous judge who is my Heavenly Father as he is so am I.
[time=2192] I am a part of him. I am a one with him. I am related to him in the judgment process therefore I should have nothing to fear from standing before the judge.
[time=2202] Someone is written that those who are like their judge can wait with confidence the result of his decisions.
[time=2210] I don't sit in fear wondering that the judge will swoop down upon me and destroy me.
[time=2215] He has brought me into his family and made me a part of his love.
[time=2219] And someday when I stand before the Lord Jesus Christ at the Bema Seat it will not be with fear but it will be with anticipation.
[time=2226] I may stand there in boldness because my judge is the Son of God who paid for my redemption and as he is so am I.
[time=2235] The Bible says I am a joint heir with him. I am a fellow worker with him. I am related with Christ in his endeavors in this world and so I may have boldness.
[time=2245] The testimony of this boldness is as follows.
[time=2248] The Scripture says that when we have this holy boldness before God it is the kind of boldness that casts out fear.
[time=2256] Verse 18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love or mature love casts out fear because fear hath torment.
[time=2266] Don't you notice in the text that fear and boldness are opposites.
[time=2271] You cannot be bold in the presence of someone and be afraid of that person.
[time=2275] And I would have to say that in the judgment of Christ whether it be for the saved or the unsaved every one of you hearing me today will fall into one category or the other.
[time=2284] Either you will stand before him in boldness or you will stand before him in fear.
[time=2288] Either you will come with anticipation knowing that all is well here or you will come with fear awaiting the judgment that you are certain will come upon you.
[time=2297] We live in a world that is filled with fear. In fact there are so many fears that there is a whole category of discussion and discovery.
[time=2306] You have heard about all the phobias haven't you. You know about all of those. Some of you are familiar with claustrophobia.
[time=2313] You have problems in elevators in other close places. You get all closed in upon.
[time=2318] There are some fears. There is a fear called acrophobia. You know what that is.
[time=2323] Acrophobia is the fear of heights. I am related to an acrophobia.
[time=2329] My wife doesn't like high places. You go to the top of Pike's Peak. You better put sunglasses on her and put her in the back seat so she can't look out the window around all of those bends.
[time=2338] She has acrophobia. Some people have all kinds of phobias. The kind of phobia that John is talking about is what we might call crisis phobia or judgment phobia.
[time=2349] We are saying that it is possible for a person to look forward to judgment with fear.
[time=2355] But if God's love has surrounded you, that love casts out fear. Can't you notice the difference between your life now as a Christian as opposed to what it was before you became saved?
[time=2365] Let me give you an illustration. Some of you who come to this church and sit here as the word of God has preached come to the invitation time and you have a struggle within you because you fear the moment of decision.
[time=2376] But once you've accepted Christ, what a difference it means. What a difference it takes place in your own life and the fear is cast out and love is there and there's no longer any dread or torment of judgment.
[time=2387] But there's the anticipation of what God's going to do in those few moments. Just a capsule picture of what it's like as you look to the future.
[time=2394] Listen to the words of John as he wrote earlier in this book in 1 John chapter 2 verse 28 he wrote.
[time=2400] And now little children abide in him so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from him at his coming.
[time=2411] Could I ask you to stop for just a moment in your thought process during this sermon and ask yourself this very important question right now, right as you listen to me, as I think about the coming of Christ, do I do so with anticipation and boldness or do I do so with fear?
[time=2429] That in itself is one of the tests as whether or not you have matured in the love of God or perhaps even whether or not you know the love of God in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2440] Let me see if I can give you an illustration of what's going on in this passage.
[time=2445] John says in the 18th verse that when you have fear in your heart fear has torment. Did you know that one of the most tragic and one of the most awful aspects of punitive judgment is not the judgment itself but the waiting of the judgment.
[time=2464] Do you remember any times when you were growing up when you did something wrong during the day and your mother it was really something very wrong and your mother said to you young man, you wait till your father gets home.
[time=2483] Now it's not your father's coming home that's all that terrible, it's the awful waiting that you have to go through as the hours of the trade drag on.
[time=2492] The Bible says there's fear in the very concept of judgment. Do you know something? One of the awful things about the judgment of God is the anticipation of it.
[time=2501] The Bible says that perfect love casts out fear and when you have become matured in love there's no place for fear.
[time=2510] We've all gone through this process in our student days.
[time=2515] You remember what it was like as you were waiting for the exams to take place.
[time=2520] In seminary we had exams a number of times a year and during the week just before exam you could determine who had been perfected in theology and who hadn't.
[time=2530] Those who had been perfected in theology they didn't have any worries they just took it one day at a time when the exam came they went in and without any fear wrote the exam.
[time=2541] And if you hadn't been doing your homework if you had not been matured in theology well I want to tell you something there was fear in your heart.
[time=2548] And as the time for the exam drew near having not been perfected in theology you knew you were in trouble and it was the awful waiting for the exam wondering what he might ask.
[time=2558] Because you recognized in your heart that he could hit any number of cracks and you would go down with the exam.
[time=2565] The Bible says when you have been perfected in God's love you can anticipate the time of accounting without fear.
[time=2572] And with boldness you can come to that day when you will stand before him.
[time=2577] So you need to ask yourself this question this morning.
[time=2581] Have you in your heart a boldness toward the day of reckoning with God if you have that is the first evidence of a matured love in the whole economy of God.
[time=2592] The Bible says over in 2 Timothy 1 7 that God hath not given to us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.
[time=2604] God wants none of us to be afraid of his coming and when your love grows up it will be seen in your boldness as you anticipate the coming of Christ.
[time=2614] But notice the second evidence of mature love not only a boldness in anticipating Christ but secondly a brotherly love.
[time=2622] The Bible says in verse 19 of the fourth chapter that this fear that this love is made perfect in love and when we love him it is because he first loved us.
[time=2633] The Bible says that the second fruit of matured love for God is our love for fellow Christians.
[time=2639] We love him because he first loved us. What does that mean?
[time=2643] Does that mean that we love God in a different way than he loves us?
[time=2648] No it means that we love because God has given to us the capacity to love.
[time=2653] We love him because when he loved us he gave us in his own way the capacity to love him back.
[time=2660] You know there was no way I could ever love God before he saved me, made me one of his children.
[time=2666] I could reach out and try to lift up myself to him and try to measure up to us I couldn't love God.
[time=2671] But when I felt his love and I sensed his love and I became a Christian in the reception of the gift of eternal life there was a new capacity for me to love God.
[time=2680] And now I can reach out to him and love and express my love to him.
[time=2684] In this passage that we're examining today there are three reasons why our love for our brothers is an important matter.
[time=2693] And God tells us that this is a test of where we are in our love relationship.
[time=2699] First of all will you notice that our love for our brothers is important because it's just a matter of the opportunity God has given us.
[time=2706] He says in verse 20 if a man say I love God and hates his brother he's a liar.
[time=2712] For he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he has not seen.
[time=2719] Now that's where the tire meets the road right there.
[time=2722] Aren't you tired of all of the sentimental, syrupy discussions among people as they talk about their love for God.
[time=2729] And then you watch them in action and discover they can't get along with any Christians.
[time=2734] The Bible says that's entirely impossible.
[time=2737] The Bible says that if you say you love God but you don't love your fellow believer then you don't really love God.
[time=2743] For the argument is if you don't love the brother whom you have seen how in the world do you expect anyone to believe that you love God whom you've never seen.
[time=2752] Now I've discovered among Christians that it's very easy for us to get lost in the abstracts at the expense of the particulars.
[time=2761] We can get lost in the spiritual dimension but it never gets translated into the real dimension of life where we live.
[time=2769] We can talk about all of our pious platitudes but they don't ever seem to get translated into a relationships we have with one another.
[time=2776] And John takes his pen and goes right to the heart of that and he says if you don't love your brother don't you come to me with any of this nonsense about loving God.
[time=2785] Because if you don't love your brother whom you've seen how in the world do you expect me to believe that you love God whom you've not seen.
[time=2792] Simply a matter of opportunity isn't it.
[time=2794] God has given me the opportunity to love my brother whom I've seen.
[time=2797] That's the privilege he's given me.
[time=2800] Man has been given the opportunity he's been afforded the chance of demonstrating in his love for God the reality of that love and his love for the brothers who are around him.
[time=2811] Love has got to find an object don't you see.
[time=2815] Love is not an intransitive verb.
[time=2819] Love is a transitive verb.
[time=2821] Love demands an object.
[time=2823] And so if you have the love of God in your heart it will be like the focus of your love is looking for the object of your love.
[time=2829] And the Bible says that will automatically be others who are Christians fellow believers.
[time=2834] I was reading this week a rather philosophical argument about the Christian faith and I was impressed with one of the statements that was along the line of the fact that we live in two different realms.
[time=2847] We live in the realm of the scene and in the realm of the unseen.
[time=2851] And unfortunately most people today consider that reality is in those things which they see.
[time=2858] And not in the things which are not seen that's not the Bible's position and I don't think it should be your position.
[time=2865] I come to Eugene and I say you have a body and a spirit which part of you is the most real.
[time=2873] 100 years from now that body won't be around anymore but I expect to see you a million years from now.
[time=2879] Which part of you is the most real while it's the unseen part.
[time=2883] And yet as we look at life through human eyes often we focus in on the scene and we say that's real.
[time=2889] That's not the way God sees it.
[time=2891] In fact the interesting thing about being a Christian is this.
[time=2894] God has given to us as Christians the privilege of looking through the things that are seen and as we look at them we can go beyond them to the realities of the unseen.
[time=2906] Someone has written that the Christian is one whom God has prepared so that he can look at the obvious and see through the obvious the actual.
[time=2915] Now let me explain what I mean.
[time=2917] I can say to you that I love God.
[time=2919] But over here is a man who is a child of God.
[time=2923] If I really love God I'm going to focus my attention and my love upon that child and I'm going to see in that child of God the obvious reality that is behind that child which is God himself.
[time=2935] He is the recipient of God's love and I'm going to love him and by loving him I'm going to see through him to the one who is behind him even God himself.
[time=2944] That's one of the privileges we have as Christians.
[time=2947] We can see the unseen world that is behind the seen world.
[time=2954] And the Bible says that if we don't love the ones we see we are not to talk about loving the one we don't see.
[time=2960] For that one we see you see God has given that one to our world so that we might love God through them.
[time=2968] That doesn't mean that we don't love God as a person and that we say we love our fellow man instead of loving God not that at all.
[time=2975] John is simply reminding us that the opportunity God has given us is to love people into here and now.
[time=2981] You've heard me quote the poem on occasion to love the whole world for me is no chore.
[time=2986] My only real problem is the guy next door.
[time=2989] There's a lot of truth in that isn't it?
[time=2991] We can love in the abstract God wants us to love in the particular.
[time=2996] Well let me say to you that it's not only a matter of opportunity this loving of our brother is a matter of obedience.
[time=3004] Verse 21 pretty plain he says and this commandment have we from him that he who loveeth God love his brother also.
[time=3013] The Bible says it's not optional so many times I hear Christians talking about how they feel sometimes more loving toward others than at other times.
[time=3023] Sometimes we get the impression that we kind of fall in and out of the loving spirit.
[time=3028] The Bible says we're to love whether we feel like it or not.
[time=3031] We're to love whether it's in our hearts to do it or not.
[time=3033] We're to love because as a matter of obedience God has commanded us to love one another.
[time=3039] There's far too much feeling in the world's concept of love.
[time=3043] God says it's a response that we take by faith and obedience to him.
[time=3048] The Bible says the one who fails to love his brother fails twice.
[time=3053] First of all he fails his brother and that he doesn't love him.
[time=3057] Secondly he fails his God because he's disobedient.
[time=3061] So I want to tell you that this matter of loving one another is not an option folks.
[time=3065] I know that some of us are more unlovable than others.
[time=3068] I know that some of us are harder to love than others but the Bible says you don't have any choice.
[time=3072] You've got to love me.
[time=3074] You may not like it.
[time=3075] You may not feel like you want to.
[time=3077] It may not be the natural thing but God's asking you to do the supernatural thing.
[time=3080] And just remember that while you're trying real hard to love me I've got the same problem with you.
[time=3085] You see?
[time=3088] It's all a matter of being obedient to God.
[time=3091] He's commanded us to love.
[time=3097] It's not an emotion that comes and goes but it's a duty required of us at all times.
[time=3103] And then will you notice that this loving of one another is a matter of oneness.
[time=3107] I like what he says at the beginning of the fifth chapter.
[time=3109] He says, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat
[time=3115] loveth him also that is begotten of him.
[time=3118] Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is a begotten one.
[time=3123] And the Bible says that if you love the one who begat, that's the father, then you're also going to love the one who was begotten.
[time=3133] When Don and I were going together, I've told you before, she's a cat lover.
[time=3137] Came right down to this, love me, love my cat.
[time=3140] That's the way it was.
[time=3142] You know, there's something like that right here.
[time=3148] God says, "You love me, love my children." That's where it's at.
[time=3153] You know, I was thinking about this this week and I was trying to figure out a way to express this to you.
[time=3158] And I thought, "You know, I want to say to these people that there's going to be a love between those who are part of the same family.
[time=3167] I want to say to them that if you're in the same family, there's just normally a naturally a love for one another.
[time=3173] And I thought twice about that.
[time=3175] I remembered some of the spats between my children.
[time=3177] I remembered some of the spats I had with my families.
[time=3180] Maybe that illustration is not a good one.
[time=3182] And then I thought again, it is a good one.
[time=3185] But I remember the day, the one that I fought with on occasion at home was under attack by somebody else outside of the home.
[time=3192] And I came home with a few bloody marks on my face because I got into a war with somebody who was going to do something to one of my family members.
[time=3200] You know, we can spat and fight a little bit once in a while between us. That's family ways, I guess, part of growing up.
[time=3207] But I think we demonstrate the family oneness when someone from the outside tries to attack one of our family members.
[time=3214] I want to tell you the Bible says that we're to love one another because it's family business.
[time=3219] We're family folks.
[time=3221] We're the forever family.
[time=3222] God's put us all together and it's such a tragic thing when we see us striking out at one another.
[time=3227] There are some people who feel their whole calling in life is to separate the family when God's ministry is to unite the family.
[time=3233] Now I'm not talking about any kind of ecumenical foolishness.
[time=3236] I don't believe you can unite a family if there isn't blood running in the veins of the people, the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=3242] But in the family of God there's oneness because we're brothers in Christ.
[time=3247] We're brothers and sisters in Christ and we have God as our Father.
[time=3251] And because of that there ought to be family oneness between us. The Bible says by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep His commandments.
[time=3261] Now I want to ask you something. What's your love quotient?
[time=3264] Some of you right now as I'm preaching, thinking about people in the family of God you can't stand.
[time=3269] Maybe you go out the other door because you don't want to talk to them.
[time=3273] Right here in this little sample, I don't know if that's true but it could be, it's probably true.
[time=3278] Knowing the carnality of people today and the old sin nature.
[time=3283] God says, listen, I want to tell you something.
[time=3287] You have a responsibility to love out of obedience.
[time=3290] Number two is a demonstration of your love for me.
[time=3293] And number three, because you're a part of my family.
[time=3296] And you better understand what your family responsibilities are.
[time=3301] How can you know if your love is mature?
[time=3304] You can know it by your boldness.
[time=3306] You can know it by your brotherly love and I don't have time to talk about the third one but you can get it from the text.
[time=3311] You can know it by your behavior.
[time=3313] We love God when we keep His commandments.
[time=3315] Shall we pray?
[time=3317] Father, bless this word to our hearts we pray today.
[time=3321] Help us to know in our own hearts that our love is maturing.
[time=3325] As we see the boldness growing within us as we approach the day of Christ and as we reach out to love one another.
[time=3332] Because of the opportunity we have, because of obedience unto the, because of the oneness we have in the family of God.
[time=3339] We pray this in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=3343] We're going to sing together a hymn of invitation.
[time=3349] In response to the message from God today, hymn number 546, turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=3358] I want to ask that in these moments that we close our service that you will not leave unless you absolutely have to.
