[time=14] From the Publication Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerhamon.
[time=25] [MUSIC]
[time=51] >> Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=55] One of the common expressions with which we greet one another as we pass upon the street is the expression, "What do you know?
[time=66] What do you know today?" And that's what I'd like to ask all of you here in this auditorium and wherever you hear my voice, "What do you know?" And I'm not answering that question with any of the tried expressions
[time=81] with which we often answer it when we are addressed by one of our fellow citizens, but I'm answering that question from the Word of God, "What do you know?" And what is it that God wants you to know?
[time=93] In the Word of God today, we're going to study a passage of Scripture that tells us two things we can know for sure.
[time=99] And in a world of uncertainty, when no one seems to be sure of anything anymore, one of the great blessings we have as believers is that we have a no-so faith
[time=110] in which we may express great confidence and boldness.
[time=114] So I trust that you will have your Bibles ready to turn in a few moments to the book of 1 John, and we're going to talk together about what we can know for sure from the heart of God.
[time=124] First of all, we have planned some good music to share with you, to encourage your heart and prepare you for the moment of studying the Word of God.
[time=134] I trust you'll listen now to the ministry of our choir as they sing one of the favorite hymns of most Christians, a hymn entitled "Near the Cross," and they're under the direction today of Mr. Pete Coby.
[time=147] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=313] There is in the cross of Christ rest, and there is in the Word of God strength.
[time=320] So this morning, I would like to read for you Galatians 6 chapter verses 1 through 9.
[time=327] Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual restore such a one
[time=334] in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest you also be tempted.
[time=341] Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[time=347] If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself,
[time=353] but let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone,
[time=360] and not in another, for every man shall bear his own burden.
[time=365] Let him that is taught in the Word share with him that teaches in all good things.
[time=372] Be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap;
[time=379] for he that sows to his flesh shall reap of his flesh corruption; but he that sows to the spirit shall reap of the spirit life everlasting;
[time=390] let us not be weary and well-doing; for in new season we shall reap if we faint not.
[time=397] I have read for you today Galatians 6 verses 1 through 9.
[time=405] Thank you, Rick, for leading us in the reading of God's Word.
[time=409] I am sure that those of you who were able to share with us just recently, our annual July musical presentation, found it to be a most encouraging evening together.
[time=421] Almost 2,500 people gathered here for the two concerts that were given on that Sunday evening,
[time=427] and my, didn't our musicians sing well.
[time=429] They just were a blessing.
[time=431] We received letters back from people all over the area who visited with us.
[time=434] Some of the leaders of government have written to us to express their appreciation.
[time=439] We are just so grateful for the gift that God has given to so many of our people to be able to share what is in their heart through the ministry of music.
[time=449] And of course it is all the responsibility of our minister of music, Mr. Kobe.
[time=454] He has worked so diligently to put all of this together and we are so grateful to him.
[time=458] One of the musical groups that is very much appreciated by all of us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=464] and seem to get a great deal of appreciation from our many visitors the other night too is the Men Singers Quartet.
[time=471] And I trust that you will enjoy their ministry now as they sing for us a song entitled, Now I Belong to Jesus.
[time=479] [MUSIC]
[time=492] Jesus, my Lord, will love me forever.
[time=498] From him the power of me that can sever.
[time=505] He gave his life to ransom my soul.
[time=511] Now I belong to him.
[time=518] Now I belong to Jesus.
[time=523] Jesus belongs to me, but for the years of time of time alone.
[time=536] But for eternity.
[time=544] Once I was lost in sin's degradation.
[time=551] Jesus came down to bring me salvation.
[time=558] Lifted me up from sorrow and shame.
[time=564] Now I belong to him.
[time=571] Now I belong to Jesus.
[time=576] Jesus belongs to me, but for the years of time alone.
[time=589] But for eternity.
[time=597] Joy what's my soul for Jesus has saved me.
[time=603] Free me from sin that long had enslaved me.
[time=610] His precious blood he gave to redeem.
[time=617] Now I belong to him.
[time=624] Now I belong to Jesus.
[time=629] Jesus belongs to me, but for the years of time alone.
[time=642] But for eternity.
[time=655] Thank you so much for being a part of the Bible Hour today and for sharing with us on this special time that we take away from the formal service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=665] This is a time that Don and I look forward to each week because it gives us an opportunity to share with you some of the things that pertain specifically to our congregation at large the many faithful friends who make up the television audience of the Bible Hour each week.
[time=680] And Don it seems like the congregation is growing because we're receiving letters from ever widening places of interest where people are watching the Bible Hour.
[time=690] We've received a number of letters this week from the New York area where we have just been on for a few weeks and I'd like to share a letter with you folks that we received this week from New York.
[time=702] Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to understand God's word.
[time=707] I am from Indonesia and came to America two years ago to study linguistics.
[time=712] My earlier study was at a procreal school. When I was 18 I felt that I did not know anything about the Bible.
[time=721] In the beginning I was glad that I did not know anything about the Bible and I did not belong to the group of holy people.
[time=728] That is those who go regularly to church and read the Bible regularly.
[time=733] But now I feel the hunger. Your Bible Hour is a blessing to me.
[time=738] And Don as I read the postmark on that letter I was excited to find out that that young man who is from Indonesia is a student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.
[time=748] And through the cable systems and through the station there in Syracuse he's been able to get the Bible Hour.
[time=753] And God is using the teaching of the Word of God to open his heart and to enable him to have that hunger satisfied that he mentioned in his letter.
[time=762] And that's what we're all about. That's why we teach the Word and that's why we have the Bible Hour every Sunday.
[time=767] Why we're trusting that God will enable us financially to continue to see it expand because we're committed to the fact that that's the need that people have and it can only be met through the teaching of God's Word.
[time=777] Share that other letter will you?
[time=779] Okay. This is another letter from New York and this person writes, "Your program is a great blessing to me. We need you in this central New York area.
[time=788] I personally need what you teach on the Bible Hour. I'm a new Christian and hunger for God's Word.
[time=795] I read the Bible daily but get so much more from the passage that you preach.
[time=800] You have shown me so much more in 1 John than I got on my own. Thank you. I will remember you in my prayers."
[time=808] There are two letters, one from someone who is on their way to becoming a Christian, I'm sure.
[time=814] And one from a new Christian, both of whom are finding that the teaching of the Word of God is exactly what they need in their life.
[time=821] And doesn't that encourage us?
[time=824] It sure does. It's interesting to see the wide spectrum of people that television reaches.
[time=829] Just yesterday I had a call from someone who is in Lutheran Hospital here in Fort Wayne and they watch our television ministry while they're there and they've got several of their friends to watch too.
[time=840] So it ministers to a wide group of people.
[time=843] In Fort Wayne, in Syracuse, in Indianapolis, Chicago, wherever the program is seen, we know that when we preach the Word of God, God is going to use that preaching to accomplish His will in the lives of people.
[time=856] And one of the things we have recently been doing is attempting to do everything possible to extend the ministry of the Bible Hour beyond the one hour that we have each Sunday to proclaim God's truth.
[time=868] And we're extending that through the use of printed materials that help individuals to get into the Bible for themselves on a daily basis.
[time=876] Why don't you tell our friends, honey, about the exciting way to study the Bible that has only been in existence here for about five months and God is using around the country?
[time=887] So many people have expressed a desire to get into the Word for themselves and yet they felt that they weren't really equipped to do it on their own.
[time=895] And so a few months ago my husband decided to print a monthly Bible study guide.
[time=901] It has questions in it for you to read, for you to answer as you read a certain passage of Scripture.
[time=907] And it's a place for you to write down your answers and it makes you think through the passage that you've been studying.
[time=913] And that's what we're hoping to put into the hands of every single person who watches the Bible Hour in these next days.
[time=919] We'd like to encourage you right now if you have not yet written or called to receive the monthly Bible study called the Book of the Month study.
[time=928] To just in a moment, watch your screen and listen carefully so that you can hear the number and write down the address and get in touch with us.
[time=936] And we'd like to send you free and postage paid your own personal copy of the Bible study guide on the first, second and third epistles of John.
[time=945] A very timely one because that happens to be the section of Scripture that I'm using for our Sunday morning Bible studies on the Bible Hour.
[time=952] Along with this we'd like to send you another devotional help which is called My Prayer, Praise and Personal Goals.
[time=960] A little pamphlet that enables you to write down your own requests as you pray each day.
[time=965] And we're urging everyone who writes for the prayer and praise goal booklet to go through the book and on every day put the Bible Hour at least in the top five so that you remember to pray for us day by day as we proclaim God's truth.
[time=978] These two booklets, The Bible Study Guide and My Prayer and Praise Goals, are our free offers to you this week.
[time=986] And we'd like for you to call us and request them as God lays this upon your heart.
[time=991] We've tried to make it just as easy as possible to put these materials in your hands.
[time=995] And one of the things we're doing as of recently is providing a free, a toll-free number that you can call from any place in the United States.
[time=1004] This number will put you in touch with the Bible Hour operator who in turn will get the information that she needs so that we can send you this week these Bible study aids.
[time=1014] Donna, why don't you remind them of that special number they need to call?
[time=1018] The number for you to call is 1-800-247-2160 and be sure and ask for the Bible Hour operator.
[time=1028] Or if you prefer, you may write to us write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1038] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1041] I hope you've written those numbers down. In case you didn't get them all, they'll be given again at the end of our telecast today.
[time=1048] But please pray diligently will you about your part in getting involved in the Word of God daily as well as in this Bible Study Hour that we bring into your home each week.
[time=1058] We appreciate your prayers and especially recently the many sacrificial gifts of you who have stood with us during the summer months to keep the Bible Hour on the air in your area.
[time=1069] As God lays this ministry upon your heart, we appreciate your prayers and your support for it is through your individual involvement with us that we're able to keep on sharing the good Word of God's truth with our many friends in the areas of the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=1085] Now it's time for us to get back to our morning service. In just a few moments, I'm going to have the privilege of opening God's Word and sharing with each of you two things that you can know for certain as a Christian.
[time=1097] I trust you'll stay with us to enjoy the music and the ministry of God's truth.
[time=1127] I love you by the right way.
[time=1132] I trust you'll stay with us today.
[time=1195] Quite often when people share the ministry of music of this church, I'm asked where all of these people who share their beautiful gifts come from.
[time=1205] And the generally accepted idea is that we have a page, staff full of musicians.
[time=1210] The unfortunate truth about all of that is that unfortunate from their standpoint, they're not paid, but fortunate from our standpoint, they are musicians.
[time=1224] And God has used our laypeople in a wonderful way to minister to the hearts of folks.
[time=1229] And I personally wouldn't be afraid to put the lay ministry of music of our church up against any of the churches I've ever attended.
[time=1237] We are blessed indeed of God to have gifted people here who can share with us from their heart what God has put within them through song.
[time=1246] One of our musicians is the singing banker, Mr. Ron Hackett.
[time=1251] Ron has been a blessing to us almost from the inception of our church. He came just shortly after the church was founded and has blessed our hearts many times through his ministry of music.
[time=1260] Ron's going to sing for us now before the message.
[time=1266] [MUSIC]
[time=1279] Lord, I've been wandering far from the fall.
[time=1288] Fearing to face the tomorrow's, but I've heard all the things that you've told.
[time=1303] But why is my life full of sorrow?
[time=1311] I realize that you gave your sin, and by his stripes I kneel, but I need the touch of your spirit right now to have the faith that's real.
[time=1340] Lord, you hold all the answers.
[time=1348] From you I can never be proud, and warm, and I know that you promised to give me all the desires of my heart.
[time=1369] [MUSIC]
[time=1383] And it seems like the time goes so fast.
[time=1391] Here's multiply by the hour, but there's comfort in knowing that I know.
[time=1406] Austin at all to his power, I only now can faintly see all that he has for me.
[time=1428] But trusting in him will see the road where troubles used to be.
[time=1442] Lord, you hold all the answers, and you I can never be proud, and warm, I know that you promised to give me all the desires of my heart.
[time=1471] [MUSIC]
[time=1494] Thank you, Ron. Let's take the book of promises that God has given to us, the Bible, and turn in our Bibles to the book of 1 John.
[time=1503] And I want to begin my reading today in the book of 1 John at the 13th verse of the 5th chapter, and I want us to read together from God's Word beginning at verse 13 and concluding with verse 17.
[time=1521] 1 John chapter 5 verse 13 through 17. Now will you follow in your Bibles as I read from mine this scripture text which we are going to study together today.
[time=1533] These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.
[time=1544] And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hearth us, and we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
[time=1560] If any man see his brother, sin, a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
[time=1569] There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. Let us pray.
[time=1582] And Father, having read now from thy word, we come into thy presence again through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, asking that the Word of God which we have read will be implanted in our hearts as it comes through the eye and the eargates into our minds we pray that you will give us perception.
[time=1606] And that as that truth then becomes understood truth, we will apply it to our own lives, and we will allow the Holy Spirit to bring conviction where that is needed, and assurance where that is needed.
[time=1620] And the Word of God will have an effective ministry within each of us as we hear it proclaimed today. Use thy word as it goes forth from this pulpit in these next few moments to do that which God alone can do, for we pray in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, amen.
[time=1643] Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the great prince of preachers, used to like to tell the story of an old Welsh woman who he would visit on occasion, and as she got to be older in life and a bit more feeble, she came at last to the closing days of her life.
[time=1664] And Spurgeon went to see her one day in her sick room and sort of on the spur of the moment as he walked into the door, he said, "Sister, are you sinking?"
[time=1673] And it so arrested her that she sat straight up in bed, she said, "Sinking, pastor, did you ever hear of anyone sinking through a rock?"
[time=1683] She said, "I'm on the rock Christ Jesus, how could I possibly be sinking?" Spurgeon said as he went back to his home, he had gone to minister to her and she in turn had ministered to him, for she had reminded him again of the certainty of relationship with God because of the solid rock Christ Jesus.
[time=1705] We sing often in this church, "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand."
[time=1719] And that is the message that John has for us in this book, which bears his name as we come to these very familiar and favorite verses.
[time=1727] For throughout these next verses that we have read today, John uses a word, the word no, a translation of two different Greek words, Genosco and Oida.
[time=1739] He uses that word no some seven times between verses 13 and 21.
[time=1745] The general concept that John is teaching us is that there are certain things about the Christian life and about life in general that we who are believers in the Lord,
[time=1756] may know we may be certain about them.
[time=1760] These terms of knowledge which John gives us in these verses are favorite terms of his.
[time=1766] In fact, if you had the opportunity to go through the book of 1 John, an assignment which we often give to new believers,
[time=1773] and underline the word no, every time it occurs you would discover that some forty times in these five chapters John uses the words that are translated by the English word no.
[time=1785] He is reminding us that there is much in the Christian life about which we may have confidence and assurance.
[time=1793] John is writing in this passage so that we might again evaluate our own lives as Christians and come to grips with certain things that can be fixed upon the stability of our heart which we may know for certain, certain truths which are ours.
[time=1811] And I'd like to take the time in this message this morning to talk about two of them and we shall finish them up next week.
[time=1818] The two things that John tells us we may know in the verses we have read are these.
[time=1822] First of all we may know that we have eternal life and secondly we may know that we have effective prayer ministry.
[time=1831] And as I show you in a few moments from the Word of God the two of these are related very closely one with the other.
[time=1839] Let's notice first of all the certainty of eternal life.
[time=1843] Verse 13 reads this way these things have I written unto you that you may know that you have eternal life.
[time=1852] The certainty of eternal life.
[time=1855] Now notice first that this certainty is the very purpose of this entire letter first John.
[time=1862] Certainty is the purpose of the epistle. These things have I written that you may know.
[time=1868] It is very easy for us to associate these words in John's first epistle with some familiar words from his gospel.
[time=1877] In John's gospel chapter 20 and verse 31 he wrote these words.
[time=1882] These things have been written that you might believe.
[time=1887] Now if you want a good handle on John's gospel and on his epistle you can take these two phrases and in a very short time you can come to the very core of John's purpose in writing the gospel and in writing the epistle.
[time=1901] He said I wrote the gospel that you might believe. I have written the epistle that you might know.
[time=1908] The gospel basically was written as an evangelistic tool to bring men and women to faith.
[time=1914] It is the exposition of the life of Christ his suffering his passion his resurrection.
[time=1920] John said these things in the gospel I have written that you might believe.
[time=1925] Someone has suggested that the first epistle may have accompanied the gospel as sort of a follow-up letter for those who did believe and now he writes in the fifth chapter of 1 John these things I write unto you that you may know.
[time=1938] So the purpose of the letter is here described he tells us that he has written that we might know.
[time=1945] If you were to take John's purpose in writing the gospel and in writing the epistle you could sum up the totality of the Christian experience starting even before conversion.
[time=1956] John's purpose is first of all that men might hear the word of God and then having heard that they might believe and then having believed that they might live and then having lived that they might know.
[time=1970] I trust that as you hear my voice today you have already come to the fruition of John's gospel that you have come to believe.
[time=1979] I am finding in my journeys among Christian people that there are far too many believers who have believed but who do not know who have already committed their lives to Christ but have not come to that settled assurance that ought to be the possession of every true believer in the word of God.
[time=1998] The certainty that John speaks about in this thirteenth verse is the very purpose of this epistle.
[time=2006] Someone is written that assurance is the privilege and the birthright of every regenerated man.
[time=2012] One need not grope in the dark concerning his relationship to God.
[time=2018] Every Christian may know and should know that he has eternal life.
[time=2022] I cannot what the liberals say about the impossibility of knowing your relationship with God.
[time=2027] The Bible says that it is possible to know that you're saved and that you're a Christian.
[time=2033] Don't give me any of this business about waiting until the tribunal when you stand before God and he hands down the edict.
[time=2040] The Bible says you can know now that you belong to the Lord and that every Christian ought to know.
[time=2045] And that this book, first John, was written so that you can know so that right now this very moment you can be sure that you're a Christian.
[time=2056] This knowledge is not something that we learn in a textbook but this knowledge about which John writes is an abiding conviction resting upon known facts which are written in this epistle.
[time=2071] Will you notice first of all then that this certainty is the purpose of John's letter?
[time=2076] Notice secondly in this first assurance that God has given to us in 1 John 5 that this certainty is the privilege of believers only.
[time=2086] Now will you keep in mind that John has written this letter in the context of false teachers.
[time=2091] He has been combating the Gnostics and the heretics and those apostates who went out from the church because they were not of the church.
[time=2098] He has warned many times of the spirit of the Antichrist and of those who have crept within the body to sow the seeds of heresy and wrong doctrine.
[time=2107] And so he adds by way of explanation in the thirteenth verse, "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God."
[time=2117] And in the text it literally reads this way even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God or specifically and exclusively to those of you who are Christians.
[time=2129] That means people that this certainty which is first of all the purpose of the epistle is secondly the privilege of believers only.
[time=2138] John here wanted none of those who were counterfeit Christians to claim the assurance of something they did not possess.
[time=2146] He did not want these Gnostics in their specialized class of mysticism to claim that they knew they had eternal life.
[time=2154] He was afraid lest any of the apostates who had walked away from what they did not possess would stand up and claim this promise.
[time=2161] Folks this promise is for true believers. It is for those who have trusted in Christ the knowledge that you are a Christian can only be yours if indeed you are a Christian.
[time=2173] In the course the basic Christianity course that we have taught for many years as an introduction to the Christian faith here.
[time=2180] We have a place in the class where we ask people in the class to say why it is that many Christians are not sure they are saved.
[time=2188] And inevitably one of the reasons that is given is this. They are not sure they are saved because they are not saved.
[time=2195] You see it is absolutely impossible to be sure of something if you do not have that something.
[time=2201] And the probability is that some of you who are already interested in what I am going to say about assurance should first of all be examining whether or not you are in the faith because before you come to the place of knowing you must first of all come to the place of believing.
[time=2215] Or to say it another way don't come to John's epistle unless you have been through John's gospel.
[time=2220] Don't come to knowing unless first of all you have come to believing for assurance is that privilege which belongs to Christians and only to them.
[time=2230] And then will you notice thirdly that this certainty is the product of the Word of God and the tests of the Word of God.
[time=2237] Notice that John did not say these things I have experienced with you in order that you might know.
[time=2245] These signs I have given you that you might know.
[time=2249] These miracles I have passed on to you so that you might know.
[time=2253] Now he wrote these things I have written that you might know.
[time=2259] Will you mark it down today with indelible ink that the source of assurance is the Word of God.
[time=2266] The things written are the things which you ought to study if you want to be sure that you are a Christian.
[time=2273] Now if I had time this morning we could go back through the entire book of 1 John and look at every one of the tests that John has given to bring assurance to the heart of believers.
[time=2283] But will you take your Bibles and though we won't look at all of them let's just hop and skip through the book for a moment and touch some of the high spots so that you can understand what it is that John is talking about when he says these things I have written that you might know.
[time=2299] Notice first of all in chapter 2 and verse 3.
[time=2303] And here by says John we know that we know him.
[time=2307] How do we know that?
[time=2309] If we keep his commandments.
[time=2312] And then notice chapter 2 and verse 5.
[time=2314] But who so keepeth his word in him barely is the love of God perfected.
[time=2320] Here by know we that we are in him how by keeping his word.
[time=2325] Then notice chapter 3 and verse 10.
[time=2328] In this the children of God are manifested and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother.
[time=2338] And there are two more tests.
[time=2340] Righteous life and a love for the brethren.
[time=2343] Chapter 3 verses 18 and 19. My little children let us not love and word neither in tongue, but indeed and in truth.
[time=2351] And here by we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him.
[time=2357] And I could go on to a number of other passages.
[time=2360] John is saying that in this book first John he has given to us a number of writings.
[time=2366] And by these writings we may know that we belong to the Lord.
[time=2371] Now these tests are tests that every one of us is Christians ought to put to our own lives on a regular basis.
[time=2377] And certainly none of us will pass them all perfectly.
[time=2380] But what John is saying is this is there is a total abstinence in your life of the love of the brethren.
[time=2386] If there is no commitment to the commandments of the Lord or the word of God then those tests ought to point to your life and make you filled with alarm over your own personal relationship with the Lord.
[time=2398] For these things have been written that you might know and it is the word of God that brings to us the assurance of our salvation.
[time=2407] As we look at the word and we apply these tests to our own lives we are brought to an assurance of our relationship with Christ.
[time=2417] As we examine our own hearts and our desire to obey the Lord and our desire to incorporate the word of God into our lives and this new love that we have for God's people all of those things are just like a stamp of approval upon us.
[time=2432] And God is saying that is the evidence that you belong to me that demonstrates that you are a Christian and that ought to bring assurance to your own life.
[time=2440] And I want to say just one last thing before we leave this whole matter of your assurance of eternal life.
[time=2446] This passage of Scripture certainly reminds us of the possibility of salvation without assurance.
[time=2454] Remember now that John was writing this letter to those who were already Christians.
[time=2459] He was addressing this letter from his own hand to those who were in the faith he calls them his little children.
[time=2466] And now remember that he is saying to them I am writing to you little children so that you will come to the assurance of your faith.
[time=2475] And the very concept that he is leaving to us in the text is that there were some among those Christians who weren't sure.
[time=2483] I don't know if that should encourage you or frighten you but I think it ought to let you know that it is possible to be a Christian without being sure that you're a Christian.
[time=2492] One of the questions I like to ask people is what is the difference between assurance and security?
[time=2498] Security is the certainty that you are saved and assurance is the knowledge within your own heart that you are saved.
[time=2508] John says it's possible for a person to be a Christian and not be certain of his relationship with the Lord.
[time=2515] But that is not his desire. That is not what John wants for us. That is not what God wants for us.
[time=2521] A Christian's doubts may arrest his spiritual growth.
[time=2525] A Christian's doubts may rob him of his joy.
[time=2529] A Christian's doubts about his own life may cripple his usefulness and keep him from being what God wants him to be in service, yet at the same time he could be a Christian.
[time=2538] I have discovered that those who have not come to the place in their life where they are saved and they know they are saved are not able to be used of God to affect any kind of cutting ministry for him in this generation.
[time=2551] I've often summarized this among our friends by saying how could you ever walk up to someone's house and knock on the door and when they come to the door say I've come to you to talk tonight about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2564] I think I have accepted him as my Savior. I'm not quite sure, but let's sit together and talk about our doubts.
[time=2571] That is the dialoging that often goes on among liberals.
[time=2575] Someone has said it is a time for them to sit together and collectively organize their ignorance.
[time=2581] That's not what God has called us to. He has called us to a no-so salvation and that gives us power and dynamic as we walk with him day by day.
[time=2590] The first certainty that John gives to us in this passage of Scripture is this.
[time=2595] We may know that we have eternal life and ask you today, do you know that?
[time=2599] You and you and everyone of you, do you know down in your heart that you are a Christian?
[time=2604] Is it the solid fact of your life that you have been born into God's family and that you belong to him?
[time=2610] That is the desire that God has for you.
[time=2612] Now will you notice in the text that when we know that we are accepted with God, when we know that we are part of God's family, that he is our father and we are his children, that we are sure and secure in that relationship,
[time=2627] then we can have great encouragement to approach him with our needs.
[time=2631] These verses are joined together with the conjunction and, and please don't separate them.
[time=2638] It says here that when you know that you have eternal life and you believe on the name of the Son of God, that this is the confidence that you have in him, that if you ask anything according to his will, he hears you.
[time=2650] The first certainty is the certainty of eternal life.
[time=2653] The second certainty is the certainty of effective prayer.
[time=2656] Now I don't know any Christian that doesn't want to have the certainty of effective prayer.
[time=2661] If I were to ask you today, how many of you want to be sure that your prayer life is effective?
[time=2666] All of you who are saved would raise your hands.
[time=2668] Let me remind you today that the first step in effective prayer is the settled assurance of your relationship with the father.
[time=2676] For you cannot walk boldly and with confidence into the presence of God Almighty if you have not settled once and for all your relationship with the Lord through this whole matter of assurance.
[time=2687] John reminds us here that we may come with confidence and the word once again is the word boldness.
[time=2693] The word that is used some three times in this little letter.
[time=2696] The word which means the freedom to speak one's heart, the ability to pour out one's soul, to say what's on your heart.
[time=2703] And John says when you're a child of God, when you're sure that he's your father and you're his son, you can walk into his presence and you can be free to speak your mind to the father with confidence and with boldness.
[time=2716] I like that passage of scripture in Hebrews chapter four and verse 16, do you know that one?
[time=2724] Draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace that you may receive mercy and may find grace to help in the time of need.
[time=2733] I wish for a moment you could have the Old Testament mindset on this passage of scripture.
[time=2738] How inconceivable it was for the Jew of the New Testament culture to comprehend coming into the presence of an Almighty God with confidence and boldness to speak his mind having been hung up in all of the trappings of the Old Testament culture
[time=2752] where he went through veils and rooms and guards and all the rest to approach the holy of holies.
[time=2757] Now God says to him because you're my child, you can come with boldness right into the throne room of glory and ask with confidence that which is upon your heart.
[time=2768] I want you to notice first of all the confidence of effective prayer.
[time=2772] John says we may come with boldness to God in heaven and that is all related to your relationship to the father and the assurance of your faith.
[time=2782] But notice secondly there's a condition for effective prayer.
[time=2786] He says if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
[time=2792] Oh you say preacher I'm so tired of these conditions that's where I get hung up every time.
[time=2797] I like these unconditional promises I don't like these conditional ones but this is the condition.
[time=2803] God says if you ask anything according to his will he hears you and you have it.
[time=2810] It seems to me that one of the great pursuits in prayer ought to be first of all to discern the will of God.
[time=2817] If you want to learn how to pray in confidence then make your passion in life to know God's will for you.
[time=2823] Where are you going to find that? Right here in this book in the things that have been written.
[time=2828] God says if you can come to the place where you have the assurance of his will for your life then you can pray for that and God will give it to you.
[time=2836] In fact he says it's almost as if you have it right now as you're asking.
[time=2841] I wish I had time to talk to you about this matter of according to his will.
[time=2845] But let me say two things about it lest you get lost in the process.
[time=2848] First of all if it is according to his word it is according to his will.
[time=2853] I like to remind you on occasion that since the Bible has been written God hasn't changed his mind.
[time=2860] And unless I missed it someplace in the recent years there hasn't been any new addition and there hasn't been any later translation or later addition to the text which gives us God's changed mind about his word even though there are many Christians who live as if that were true.
[time=2875] On many occasions I've had Christians say to me pastor I know that's in the Bible but I have peace about it in my own heart.
[time=2881] Let me say to you if it is in the Word that it's wrong then it isn't in the will of God.
[time=2887] God's will and his word are always married together and it is an eternal marriage that she'll never be broken.
[time=2894] And then secondly I want to remind you that to pray in the will of God means that you live in the will of God.
[time=2902] It is possible for you to discern God's will about some certain aspect of a request and know from the word of God that it is his will.
[time=2912] But then to be so living in your own life out of God's will that when you pray for that which is in the will of God because you're out of the will of God God can't answer that prayer.
[time=2922] David said it in the Old Testament he said if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.
[time=2929] There is no easy formula that I can give you for answered prayer if you choose to live in disobedience to God.
[time=2938] For the will of God is not only the expression of his word but it is the obedience of your life in response to his word.
[time=2948] So John says the condition of this prayer is that you do that you're praying in conclusion according to the will of God.
[time=2955] Now I don't know if you're understanding what I'm saying people but what this means is that if I can discern God's will absolutely I can go to the Father and pray about that.
[time=2963] And he promises me that he will answer and he will hear my prayer and he will do what I ask.
[time=2968] The conclusion of this whole thing is this that we know that we have what we ask listen to what it says in the text and this is the boldness that we have in him.
[time=2981] That if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and we know that he hear us whatever we ask we know that we have the petitions that are desired of him.
[time=2992] If we know that he hears us we know that we already have in anticipation the requests we have made.
[time=3002] The consciousness of being heard with it brings the consciousness of possession.
[time=3009] That means that if I discern the will of God and I know this is God's will all I have to do is pray and the very fact that God hears my prayer guarantees the answer.
[time=3020] In his hearing he has already answered you say well pastor what if it doesn't happen right away.
[time=3025] God hears and he answers and by faith I claim that answer the fact of the answer may come in God's own time but if I claim by faith his promise and I pray according to his will he has promised that he will hear me and that he will answer me
[time=3040] and that I will have the petitions that he has promised me in his own word.
[time=3046] Let me see if I can give you an illustration.
[time=3054] My son David has the unfortunate liability of being the second in the family and he inherited his sister's bicycle.
[time=3066] That's all right when you first start but you know no boy likes to ride around in a girl's bicycle it might be the fastest thing in the neighborhood but if it's a girl's bicycle it's no good.
[time=3075] He's been very patient and we decided some days ago that it was time for him to have a new bike and we were going to buy him a boys bike and we set a time to go get it.
[time=3086] Now first of all he discerned when he asked us about that that it was my will for him to have it.
[time=3092] We had talked about it we had discussed I said to him one day David you need a new bike all that was music to his ears.
[time=3098] That was my will and so he wasn't bashful about coming he already knew it was my will so when he asked me he knew already that he had the answer and then we set a day to get it and it's this week sometime we're going to go and get the bike.
[time=3112] But you know something in his own mind he's already got the answer and in his own mind wherever he might be in children's church right now he's riding that bike somewhere I can tell you that for sure.
[time=3124] He's already expressed his acceptance of the of the request.
[time=3129] Now he has his answer in faith he's just waiting to get it in fact you see.
[time=3135] When I can discern my father's will I go to him with assurance and I ask him for what I want and when I know it's his will and I've asked him I already accept the fact that it's mine and I thank him for it and I just wait for the date when he's going to deliver.
[time=3149] That's what John says is the certainty we may have as Christians isn't that a wonderful truth.
[time=3155] Isn't it wonderful to know that as a matter of fact I have what I'm going to receive as a matter of faith.
[time=3162] And God has told us that his resources are unlimited.
[time=3168] He has told us that he has the storehouse out of which he can get anything we need if we can just discern his will.
[time=3175] I'm learning in my own prayer life that my passion ought to be to come to grips with God's will first and to pray second.
[time=3184] Next week as we come to this passage of scripture we're going to learn that this whole matter of our prayer life is not that we might consume it upon ourselves.
[time=3193] For in these next two verses some of the most difficult verses in the book you will learn that this whole matter of prayer is a matter that we might be able to use for others.
[time=3204] Notice what he says in verse 16 and if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask he shall pray and God shall give him life.
[time=3215] The Bible says that the reason we have this certainty of prayer is that we might use it and consume it upon fellow believers.
[time=3223] Not that we might come and say oh God give me this and give me that and give me this and give me that that's alright for a child but when we grow up we're to pray for others.
[time=3232] And the whole illustration of prayer in this text is not an illustration of using prayer on ourselves but using prayer in an intercessory way for others.
[time=3241] And I want to tell you something if you read this text over you'll discover that in these verses God has given to us the key to shut down all gossip and rumor and all kinds of criticism.
[time=3251] He says if you see somebody as a Christian who's having a problem you pray for him. Don't run and tell everybody about him don't go and talk to everybody about him you pray for him.
[time=3261] The certainty of prayer that God has given us is the certainty that we might use for one another so that I can pray that God will help me to know what God's will is for your life and then I can go to the Father and claim that promise.
[time=3276] If I see my brother airing I can say Lord I know it's not your will for him to air and I come to you now in all assurance that you will hear my prayer and that you will answer and that you will restore him to fellowship with you.
[time=3289] What a difference there would be in our churches if we would approach our problems through the medium of prayer instead of trying to figure out all of the answers and through our human agency.
[time=3299] Now let me review God has said there's two things you can know number one that you have eternal life and number two that you have an effective prayer ministry
[time=3309] and I pray that every one of you as you leave here today will have first that assurance of your eternal life and secondly a commitment to the assurance in your own life of an effective prayer ministry as you discern God's will for you shall we pray.
[time=3326] Father thank you for your word thank you for what you have done to make it real in our lives and I pray that you will help us today to examine our hearts and come to know what it means to be sure.
[time=3341] And then Lord as we have the assurance of our faith may we use that assurance as a platform and foundation upon which to pray and come boldly into the throne room of glory to seek out the answers to those needs in our lives and in the lives of others.
[time=3358] We pray these things in Jesus name and for His sake amen.
