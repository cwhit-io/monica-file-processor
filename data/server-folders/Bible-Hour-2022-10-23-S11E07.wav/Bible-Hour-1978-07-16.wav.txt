[time=15] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=25] [MUSIC]
[time=55] >> Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=65] [ Pause ]
[time=71] >> Is it possible to commit a sin that God will not forgive?
[time=77] Is it possible to come to such a state in one's life that one
[time=86] is no longer retrievable as far as God is concerned?
[time=92] What is the unpardonable sin and what does the Bible mean when it says that there is a sin unto death?
[time=101] That's the subject we're going to discuss in a few moments from the book of 1 John.
[time=106] And I hope that you will have your hearts open and your Bibles ready to join us as we study the Scripture together today from this great book penned by the Beloved Apostle.
[time=117] First, we're going to have some music and we're listening now to our choir and the direction of Mr. Pete Kobe as they share with us song of praise entitled "Praise ye the Triune God."
[time=128] [MUSIC]
[time=156] >> Praise ye the angels, praise him in the heavens,
[time=163] praise him in the heavens, praise him in the heavens,
[time=196] praise him in the heavens.
[time=199] >> Praise him in the heavens, praise him in the heavens,
[time=245] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=301] - This morning I would like to read for you from the Gospel according to Matthew, the 12th chapter, verses 31 and 32.
[time=310] Wherefore, I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven men.
[time=323] And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor the age to come.
[time=338] I've read for you this morning, Matthew chapter 12, verses 31 and 32.
[time=343] - Thank you, Mr. Hawks.
[time=347] Mr. Hawks is our minister of youth, and we appreciate his ministry and his faithful reading of the word every Sunday morning.
[time=356] We're going to hear now from two of our musicians.
[time=359] First of all, Mr. Kobe, who is our minister of music, and he is joined by Beverly Brunky, and they're going to sing for us a very beautiful song entitled, "No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus."
[time=371] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=586] - During this particular time, we move away from the ones who are fellowshipping with us in the sanctuary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=594] And step aside to talk to those of you who are watching at home, how we do thank you for being a part of our ministry today.
[time=601] And we just look forward to this privilege of sharing these few intimate moments with our many television friends who sit in front of the television each Sunday to enjoy the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=613] And I have a friend here with me, Donna, my wife, and she joins me in this little time together as we talk about the things that we're trying to do to extend the ministry of the Bible hour into the homes and lives of the people we are touching.
[time=626] A few moments we're going to be talking again about a Bible study booklet that we want to share with you.
[time=631] And I think it's important for us to take just a moment and share some of the results of the Bible study ministry.
[time=637] Donna, you have a couple of exciting things that you wanted to share with our viewers today.
[time=642] - Once again, we are amazed at the wide scope that our Bible study is having.
[time=647] We have a letter today from Florida.
[time=649] Just a note to let you know, we greatly enjoy the Bible studies.
[time=653] It has caused me to be more faithful in my Bible reading, which I know pleases our Lord.
[time=659] Our prayers and financial support will always be with the Bible hour.
[time=663] May God richly bless you in the days that lie ahead.
[time=667] - And Donna, that's obviously someone who received Bible study booklet in the mail from a friend or someone who perhaps was on their way through here.
[time=675] I got a call the other day from a man in Upper Canada who was driving through a part of the country where the television ministry is seen and he called to let us know that he was praying for us and standing with us in what we're doing with the Bible hour ministry.
[time=687] And then of course, we're grateful for the ones who are close by who share in the ministry too.
[time=691] And a real nice note from someone a little closer than Florida.
[time=695] - Right, this one comes from Bern, Indiana.
[time=698] I am getting more and more out of the Bible since I joined your Bible study club and I'm enjoying it very much.
[time=705] I just finished the three books of first, second, and third John and have learned something new again.
[time=711] May God bless you in starting a Bible study club.
[time=715] - Donna, one of the things we are all about as a television ministry and what we're trying to do, not only through the hour's presentation each Lord's day, but through the publications that are sent out is to put into the hands of our many friends, tools and helps that will get them into the Word of God and be a source of blessing for them each day.
[time=734] In a moment, we're going to tell you how you can get your own personal Bible study guide for this month, but before we do that, this month's auxiliary help is a little booklet called My Prayer, Praise and Personal Goals.
[time=746] It is something you want to keep with your Bible and with your Bible study booklet.
[time=750] It is, there's a place for every day of the week so that you can write down your personal prayer requests, opportunities for you to put down the goals that you have spiritually, physically, mentally, et cetera, and to trace through what God is doing for you as you study the Word of God and as you pray.
[time=767] Now, one of the things we've learned through the production of the Bible study material is that people are looking for a method, a way that they can get into the habit of doing what they know they ought to do.
[time=778] And we're going to be very happy to send these materials to you, and Donna, I want you to tell them how they can get the materials in the very quickest way possible.
[time=786] - We have set up a toll-free number that you may call no matter where you are, just pick up your phone and dial 1-800-247-2160, ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like the study helps that were offered on today's program.
[time=804] Once again, the number is 1-800-247-2160, and you can call that number any time of the day or night.
[time=812] I think that that's one of the most convenient ways that we can get feedback back from our television friends.
[time=818] It is sometimes easy to postpone writing a letter, but right now, right now while it's on your mind and while you're thinking that you'd like to have these Bible study helps, go right to your phone and call that number, and make sure when you do that you ask the operator to give you the Bible Hour office, and then tell that particular operator what it is that you want, she'll ask you what station you're watching, and then we'll get that information back here the next day and be happy to send you the Bible study materials this very week.
[time=848] Now, the 800 number is free, it doesn't cost anything, and as Donna has said, you can call from any place where you're hearing my voice absolutely free from your own telephone, and I know that the result will be the input into your life of some very positive Bible study materials.
[time=864] Now, Donna, before we get back to the service, we ought to say just a word about the Bible studies and how they work.
[time=870] All right, each month, if you contact us, we will send you a Bible study booklet that takes you through an exhaustive study of a particular book of the Bible.
[time=879] There's a passage in there assigned each day for you to read, and then there are a number of questions for you to answer so that as you read the passage, you have to think about what you're reading and put down the answer to the questions that are there.
[time=891] - And those who've already been a part of the book of the month club have had the privilege of studying the Old Testament book of Malachi, the book of Ephesians, first and second Corinthians, first, second and third John, and now we're just about to move into the studies at first and second Timothy, and this fall we'll be spending five months in the Book of Romans, which is one of the great books of the New Testament.
[time=911] We'd really like to have you a part of the ministry of the Bible study, and we trust that right now, while you're thinking about it, you'll get in touch with us and let us know that you would like to have the June issue or the issue on first, second and third John, and the issue that will be sent to you during the month of July, and then also this particular book on prayer and praise goals.
[time=932] Donna, you do the 800 number so well, I'm gonna ask you to do that again, and I have a hard time remembering it, so you tell them.
[time=939] - The number to call is 1-800-247-2160, and remember to ask for the Bible Hour operator and she'll be glad to help you.
[time=949] - And of course, if you would rather write, you can write to us at Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=957] We'd be happy to hear from you.
[time=959] I want to encourage you during these summer months to do all that you can to keep us at the very top of your prayer list, and to remember that it is your prayer and support that makes it possible for us to continue this television ministry.
[time=973] As we have opportunity on occasion to share the details of the financial burden of the television ministry with individuals, most of them are shocked at the cost to keep this ministry on the air each week.
[time=984] We're discovering that it is not the large gifts of a few people that make it possible for us to continue, but it is the gifts of everyone who's a part of it at the level that they're capable of giving that makes it possible for the Bible Hour to keep on ministering the Word of God consistently week after week.
[time=1002] We'd like to hear from you this week, and we'll be happy to send you these materials.
[time=1005] Once again, the materials are free with no obligation.
[time=1008] They're simply an extension of our ministry to you.
[time=1011] We'd love to hear from you this week, so call us or write us, and we'll be happy to respond.
[time=1016] It's time now to get back to the morning service, and just a few moments I'm going to be speaking on a very controversial subject, the subject entitled, "The Sin unto Death." (soft music)
[time=1043] [MUSIC - 54 seconds]
[time=1102] - This week, we had the privilege of being
[time=1111] with the Black Hawk Singers in a conference over in Winona Lake, and just a thrill to see how God is using the people of our church as they have an opportunity to be a testimony and witness in the areas of music.
[time=1123] One of the members of the Black Hawk Singers is Starr Narr Wald, and she's going to sing for us now before the message.
[time=1130] - Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him,
[time=1137] he shall never thirst, and the water that I shall give him shall become in him like a well of water, springing up to eternal life.
[time=1145] [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=1376] (gentle music) - Let's pray together, please.
[time=1395] Our Father in Heaven, we're grateful that
[time=1401] we can come with our tears and know that you care for us.
[time=1408] With our heartaches and our difficulties, our despair, our hurts, the agonies that we can't even express or explain.
[time=1419] How grateful we are that there is not a care that has not been expressed in the life of our Savior.
[time=1429] And that is why no one ever cared for us like him.
[time=1435] That those tears we shed, those difficulties we face, were a part of the wonderful plan that he has for our lives and that someday he's going to wipe away all those tears and we shall live and be with him forever.
[time=1449] For the time and the opportunity that we have to serve him and for the privilege of working with him and for him and for some of the discouragements that we face along the way, we give you thanks.
[time=1463] But we recognize our Father that all we need to do is come to him whose agonizing tears in the garden pled for our cause and know that he understands.
[time=1475] Thank you for the ministry we have already experienced today through music, through the spoken and read word.
[time=1482] Bless our hearts now as we look into this portion of thy word in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1487] And I'm asking you to turn with me this morning to the fifth chapter of the book of First John.
[time=1494] First John chapter five, we are just about to conclude our studies in the first epistle.
[time=1500] And I suppose that if I had any sense at all, I would do as many pastors do when they come to thorny passages like this one.
[time=1508] I would announce next week my next subject and go on.
[time=1512] But I can't get by with that because it's here and I have to deal with it.
[time=1518] And I want to warn you at the outset that the truth that is here written in this passage of scripture concerning the sin unto death is one of the most awesome warnings in the word of God to Christians today.
[time=1531] I want you to be very careful that you hear what I say and not what I don't say.
[time=1536] That you write down at least in your heart and in your mind the truths that I believe are incarnate in this passage of scripture.
[time=1545] And that you're very careful that you understand all of the nuances that are involved in our interpretation and application of this portion of scripture.
[time=1554] You will remember that last week we talked together about three things that we can know for certain.
[time=1559] We can know that we have eternal life.
[time=1562] We can know that we have boldness before the Lord when we come to Him in prayer.
[time=1568] We can know that He hears our prayers.
[time=1571] A part of the illustration that John gives for the answer of prayer is found in this particular example which we are studying this morning.
[time=1579] He says, and if we know that He hear us, verse 15, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of Him.
[time=1588] If any man see his brother, sin, a sin, which is not unto death, he shall ask and he shall give him life for them, that sin not unto death.
[time=1598] There is a sin unto death.
[time=1601] I do not say that he shall pray for it.
[time=1604] All unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death.
[time=1609] Now, before we get into the problem that is before us with the question of what is the sin unto death, will you remember with me that this illustration was given in its primary resource, its primary reason, so that the men and women who were studying about God's promise to answer prayer would understand that His purpose in answering prayer was not that they might consume the results of their praying upon themselves, but that they were to reach out to others in their prayers.
[time=1639] And so his first and primary example of this prayer ministry is this.
[time=1644] When you pray and you're in the will of God and you know that God is going to hear you, let your praying be done for others.
[time=1652] And he uses the illustration of two brothers and two different kinds of sin.
[time=1657] I would go on record as saying at the outset of this message today that if we were to follow the instructions in this passage, and when we see a brother sinning, whether it be known to us that it is a sin unto death or not, we involve ourselves in the intensive prayer ministry that is here encouraged, we would do well.
[time=1676] And we would save not only ourselves and our churches a great deal of grief, but we would also take I'm certain a load of concern and grief from the heart of the Almighty God.
[time=1687] The passage, however, says that we are to pray for our brothers, and it says we are to pray for one who has sinned a sin which is not unto death.
[time=1698] And then John drops this little bombshell in the text and he says, there is a sin unto death.
[time=1704] And I say to you, if you have a brother and you know that he is sinning a sin unto death, I do not require that you pray for him.
[time=1712] What then is this sin unto death?
[time=1716] Now if you had the opportunity that I have had over these past days to look through all of that which has been written on this subject, you would probably be very confused.
[time=1727] For almost everyone who has taken pen in hand to write a commentary on first John has decided that he has the novel and a unique answer to this particular problem.
[time=1737] Let me say to you that there are some things we need to understand that are not true of this passage.
[time=1743] First of all, there are a number of people who try to make this particular sin an individual sin or a special sin.
[time=1752] It is always interesting to me that it is usually a sin outside of their sphere of possibility or one that they would not normally sin.
[time=1761] In the early days of the writing on this passage of scripture, there were some who said that this passage referred to the commission of the seven deadly sins and they went on to list them among which was blaspheme, adultery, murder, et cetera.
[time=1776] Unfortunately, there is no warrant in the word of God for that particular assumption.
[time=1780] We shall talk about that in a few moments.
[time=1783] Some have said that the sin which is the sin unto death is a sin against the church or the hatred of God's church which is the expression of his body or is his body in this world.
[time=1794] And much of their thoughts in this regard have to do with what John has already said in this passage of scripture about the importance of our loving one another in the faith.
[time=1804] Some have said that the sin unto death is another way that John is using to refer to the heretical denial of the Lord as he has been dealing with that subject in this book.
[time=1815] You remember, he said, you need to remember that Jesus Christ is God, he is divine, that he is human and he deals with the Gnostic philosophy which was heretical in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1827] Some have said that John is saying in this passage of scripture that the sin unto death is a sin committed by those who have heretically interpreted the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1838] Others have brought it down to where all of us live and have said the sin unto death is a persistent coldheartedness toward the brethren.
[time=1847] If that be true, there are many who would fall into that category.
[time=1851] And then the last but not the most interesting nor necessarily even closest to being right is the idea that the sin unto death is the same as the unpardonable sin which is referenced over in the gospels.
[time=1867] Now I want to be clear about this because almost every month I get a letter or someone comes to me concerned and convinced that they have committed the unpardonable sin.
[time=1880] And sometimes they use the language of this passage of scripture and interchange the sin unto death with the unpardonable sin.
[time=1887] I want you to note that the unpardonable sin and the sin unto death are not at all similar nor are they the same.
[time=1894] Perhaps I ought to take just a moment and explain to you what the unpardonable sin is in the books of Matthew and Mark.
[time=1901] In the third chapter of the book of Mark, we are told that blaspheme against the Holy Spirit is a sin which is not forgivable either in this life or in the life to come.
[time=1914] The writers of the gospel there are dealing with a story where an individual had attributed to Satan the works of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1923] And the apostles, the writers have said that anyone who would come to such a place in his or her life where they have so rejected the person of Jesus Christ within them and so disbelieved the person of Jesus Christ that they would take the very miraculous works at the hand of the Lord done in the power of the Holy Spirit and attribute those works to Satan, that person has come to the place in his life where he has crossed over the line of being able to believe.
[time=1955] In other words, there comes a time in the life of an unbeliever when having so consistently rejected the person of Jesus Christ and having become so obstinate about him and so determined not to have anything to do with him that they even ascribe his marvelous works to the hand of Satan, his arch enemy.
[time=1975] When that person has come to such a place in his own life, he has crossed over the line and has committed a sin which has put him in a place where he will not again believe.
[time=1987] Now I want to be careful that you understand that I have never in my life met somebody who I knew had committed the unpardonable sin.
[time=1996] I don't know of anybody.
[time=1998] I don't think there is a human being who knows of anyone who has committed the unpardonable sin.
[time=2002] For you see, the unpardonable sin is simply having crossed over the line where you no longer are able to believe.
[time=2010] What is the one sin that will send every single person to hell that is in hell?
[time=2014] It is the sin of unbelief.
[time=2017] And there comes a time in the life of a man or a woman or a young person who having heard the call upon his own soul of the spirit of God and having so rejected it in his heart becoming so hard that he resists the spirit of God.
[time=2030] And then he becomes obstinate and he crosses over that line where the spirit of God no longer strives with his spirit.
[time=2038] That man according to the text has sinned the unpardonable sin.
[time=2044] Now that means that if you think you might have, you haven't, doesn't it?
[time=2052] Doesn't it?
[time=2055] If you're concerned that you might have, you haven't because you see the man who has committed the unpardonable sin no longer has any concern for Christ.
[time=2062] He's indifferent.
[time=2063] He cares nothing about the things of the Lord.
[time=2065] And so he is just on his way to hell without any concern about it at all.
[time=2070] He has sinned away the day of grace in his own life.
[time=2073] But if you're concerned that you have, you haven't.
[time=2075] Isn't that good news?
[time=2078] And will you not take the opportunity of that warning in the books of Mark and Matthew to examine your own heart and to be understanding what I'm saying to you right now?
[time=2087] And that is you dare not go on turning your back upon the call of Christ in your life because whether you like it or not, the consistent no, no, no to what Christ says when he offers himself to you is the process by which a man builds up the calluses of unbelief until ultimately and finally he crosses over that line where even he himself cannot help himself to want to come to the place of readiness to believe.
[time=2112] Now that is the unpardonable sin.
[time=2115] I could spend a whole hour but I don't have time to do it.
[time=2118] I only explain it to you so that you will know that what I'm going to talk to you about in the book of 1 John is not the unpardonable sin.
[time=2125] It is a very difficult thing to have to spend five minutes of introduction telling your folks what it is that you're not going to talk to them about this morning.
[time=2133] But I want you to understand that so that you're clear about the subject that is before us.
[time=2138] What is the sin unto death?
[time=2142] Well, if we have time this morning to look at a number of passages in the Old Testament, we will get some clarity on where the language of this particular sin began.
[time=2151] First of all, will you turn in your Bibles to the Old Testament book of Numbers.
[time=2156] Numbers chapter 15 and verse 30.
[time=2160] Numbers 15 and verse 30 refers to a high-handed, willful kind of sin in the Old Testament economy and the record puts it this way.
[time=2170] But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land or a stranger, the same reproach of the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
[time=2183] There was in the Old Testament economy a kind of sin that a Jew could commit called a presumptuous sin, a willful high-handed sin.
[time=2192] And if a person were to commit that kind of sin, he would pay for that with the loss of his own life.
[time=2199] And we refer to that later on in the book of Psalms when David prayed this twofold prayer.
[time=2205] He said, "Lord, forgive me for my sins and keep me back from my presumptuous sins." David understood that Old Testament economy, that there was a kind of willful, high-handed, obstinate sinning that could result in capital punishment in the Old Testament economy.
[time=2223] Now, turn in your Bibles over to 1 Samuel, with the length of the rustling of leaves that takes us a little longer to find our way around in the Old Testament, does it not?
[time=2233] 1 Samuel chapter 2, and let me read verse 25.
[time=2237] 1 Samuel 2, 25, "If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him.
[time=2245] But if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?
[time=2250] Not withstanding, they hearken not into the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them." Notice chapter 3 and verse 14 of 1 Samuel, "And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever.
[time=2268] Here was a sin within the priesthood, Eli's sons who had disobeyed God, and God told them that there was a terrible penalty to be paid for such a willful and obstinate sin against the Lord." There is quite an interesting passage of Scripture in the book of Jeremiah, where we have the recorded words of our Lord instructing his prophet not to pray any longer for a certain group of people because of their obstinate, willful sin.
[time=2300] I tell you the truth when I read that and studied it for the first time, I had to go over it two or three times to make sure I was reading it correctly.
[time=2306] Here are the words of God saying to his prophet, "Don't pray for those people anymore," because of their obstinates.
[time=2314] Jeremiah, chapter 7 and verse 16.
[time=2321] Therefore, pray not thou for this people, neither lift up, cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me for I will not hear thee.
[time=2334] If you're in Jeremiah, turn over to the 14th chapter and verses 10 through 12.
[time=2338] Jeremiah 14, 10 through 12.
[time=2342] Thus saith the Lord unto this people.
[time=2345] Thus have they love to wander.
[time=2348] They have not refrained their feet.
[time=2350] Therefore the Lord doth not accept them.
[time=2352] He will now remember their iniquities and visit their sins.
[time=2356] Then said the Lord unto me, pray not for this people, for they're good.
[time=2360] When they fast, I will not hear their cry.
[time=2363] And when they offer burnt offering and an ablation, I will not accept them.
[time=2367] But I will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence.
[time=2373] Then said I, Lord God, behold the prophets say unto them, ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.
[time=2383] God goes on in this passage of scripture to describe the awful sin of the people who served when Jeremiah was the prophet and he said, they have so willfully and continually rejected me.
[time=2393] Jeremiah, don't you even pray for them anymore.
[time=2395] That sounds very much like what John says in first John chapter five, doesn't it?
[time=2400] He says, if there is a man who sins a sin unto death, I say unto you, pray not for him.
[time=2405] So it becomes quite crucial that we understand what it is that the Bible says is the sin unto death.
[time=2412] It is a sin so grievous in nature or a state so grievous in nature that God says to his own people that if ever you know of a person who is in that particular situation, I do not any longer require that you pray for that person.
[time=2427] I want to tell you what I believe from my study that this particular passage of scripture is talking about.
[time=2433] First of all, point number one, the sin unto death is committed by the saved, not by the unsaved.
[time=2440] The unpardonable sin cannot be committed by a Christian, but the sin unto death cannot be committed by an unsaved person.
[time=2449] And I'll tell you why.
[time=2451] In this passage of scripture, on two occasions, John says that we are to pray here for brothers.
[time=2458] If you see a brother sinning a sin unto death, pray for him or pray not for him.
[time=2465] Twice he reminds us that the one about whom we are to pray is a brother.
[time=2470] Now in any other book of the Bible, we might be able to interpret the word brother in a wider context.
[time=2476] One of the great expositors of the New Testament, a man by the name of John W. Stott, John R. Stott, who is from the other side of the ocean and has done a great deal of work in writing on these passages, has taken this particular word brother and he said it means neighbor and it is used in its wider meaning.
[time=2495] Well, I can't even for a moment believe that.
[time=2497] This is a book to the family.
[time=2499] And John throughout the book has been writing to his little children and he has been talking about fathers and sons and young men and brothers.
[time=2506] John is here dealing with a family truth.
[time=2510] And so when he says that this brother has sinned a sin unto death, he obviously is not talking about someone who is unsaved.
[time=2517] He's talking about a Christian.
[time=2519] Now I don't know if that sparks your interest at all Christians, but I think you ought to listen carefully.
[time=2523] The Bible says it is possible for a Christian to sin a sin unto death.
[time=2529] It is not the unpardonable sin, it is a sin unto death.
[time=2533] Point number one, the sin unto death is committed by the saved, not the unsaved.
[time=2539] Number two, the sin unto death is a state or a condition and not a specific sin.
[time=2547] If you come and ask me what is the sin unto death and you name off a dozen, it might be all of those or none of those.
[time=2555] But the Bible does not tell us that some particular act or sin that we commit against God causes us to die.
[time=2563] Someone has written that the sin unto death is not a particular sin, but it is a continued state of sinning.
[time=2571] And if you had your new testaments in the language in which they were written, you would discover that the little letter A in the text is not in the original text.
[time=2581] It does not say there is a sin unto death.
[time=2584] It says there is sin unto death.
[time=2587] And it's a very important thing for us to notice.
[time=2590] For God does not tell us that there is lurking out there, some unknown sin, and if we stumble into the commission of it, having committed that sin, we are then doomed and damned to hell.
[time=2601] But he says there is a state of sinning, a kind and quality of life, a continuation of our resistance and resentment of God that can cause us to experience death.
[time=2614] There is sin unto death.
[time=2617] It is the consistent and consummate opposition to God.
[time=2622] The idea of some sins being venial and others being mortal, and all of the ecclesiastical confusion that is resulted from that particular interpretation comes out of this passage of scripture, and there is absolutely no ground for understanding it at all.
[time=2639] The Bible does not say that some sins cause us to lose eternal life, and some sins cause us to lose mortal life.
[time=2648] But you need to understand that this is one of the passages that is often appealed to when that particular truth is taught.
[time=2656] God does not have a list of A number one kinds of sins and A number two kinds of sins, and he's got them all grated out.
[time=2664] The Bible says if we keep the whole law and offend in one point, we're guilty of all.
[time=2669] God sees it all together as far as the category of sins.
[time=2673] So he is not talking here about a specific sin.
[time=2677] He is talking about a condition.
[time=2679] It is the continuation in a sense of well-being when you are away from God and far away from his presence.
[time=2687] It is the idea that a Christian has that even though he is not in fellowship with God and he is living in sin, he can go on living in that sin and nothing will ever happen to him, that the judge doesn't know about it, the jury doesn't know about it, nobody knows about it, he can live in sin, continually flaunting his sin in front of people in his own life and God will not deal with him.
[time=2709] The sin unto death is a state or a condition, not a specific act or commission.
[time=2718] Now here comes the sticky part of it all.
[time=2721] The sin unto death results in the loss of physical life, not in the loss of spiritual life.
[time=2727] How anyone could ever say in the book of 1 John, having just read 1 John 5, 11 through 13, that this is a reference to eternal life, I don't know.
[time=2739] I think it's wonderful that the Holy Spirit of God has solved most of the apparent contradictions within the immediate context of all of the context that are in doubt.
[time=2749] And I'd like to say to all of the brothers and sisters who get confused about this passage of scripture, meaning that it could be the loss of our eternal life, that if they just go back and read what John has just got done saying, they would understand that that couldn't possibly be true.
[time=2764] For John has written in verse 11, and this is the record that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his son.
[time=2773] And he that hath the son hath life, and he that hath not the son of God hath not life, these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God, that she may know, that she have eternal life, that she may believe on the name of the son of God.
[time=2786] Now John has just done, destroyed the possibility of understanding that this life, which is lost in the sin unto death, is eternal life.
[time=2795] So it is not a reference to the loss of eternal life, but it is a reference to the loss of physical life.
[time=2803] Now, that doesn't make it any less awesome, does it?
[time=2809] And some of you probably aren't going to like what I have to say nor agree with it, but the Bible clearly teaches that a Christian can so disobey God and walk out of fellowship with the Lord in a spirit of obstinacy, that God will reach down and take that Christian out of this life prematurely in physical death.
[time=2828] Those are not my words, those are the words of the Scripture.
[time=2832] I want you to look with me at a number of passages of Scripture that demonstrate what I'm about to say.
[time=2840] First of all, will you turn with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 5?
[time=2844] I want you to see these passages in your own Bibles, because I don't want you to walk away and say he read that out of some perversion or some heretical version that doesn't speak the truth.
[time=2853] I want you to see it right in your own Bibles.
[time=2856] First Corinthians chapter five and verse five.
[time=2859] In the church at Corinth, there were a group of people who were glorying in their sin.
[time=2866] It says in verse one, it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication is not even named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife incest.
[time=2878] And then he says, you are puffed up and have not rather mourned.
[time=2883] Paul is condemning the church because rather than dealing severely with the sin of immorality, they are bragging about it.
[time=2889] They are saying this is what we have in our Christian liberty.
[time=2893] We have been freed by grace and now we can live as we please, including immorality.
[time=2898] And then he goes on to say in verse five, in the name verse four, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, I command you to deliver such in one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2919] Those are strong words.
[time=2920] Paul said there is a sense in which a person can obstinately and continually having once accepted Christ, so sin and so reject God's plan of grace in his own life that he becomes proud and obstinate about it.
[time=2934] And Paul said when a person comes to that point in time, he will be delivered for the destruction of the flesh.
[time=2940] That is death.
[time=2940] Turn over with me in the same book of 1 Corinthians,
[time=2947] chapter 11, 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 30.
[time=2952] After he had explained the importance of the communion
[time=2958] and the disorders at the communion table, Paul then said to these Corinthian believers, as he discussed this whole problem with him in the text, he said for this cause, for the cause of disorder at the communion table, and may I just interpret and interpolate here for a moment, that what they were doing is they were turning communion into a glutton's feast, each of them coming and grabbing the food from the agape love feast and trying to see who could get the most and leaving the poor out, they had turned God's communion into a gluttony feast.
[time=2992] And now Paul says, for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.
[time=2998] And the word sleep there is the word that Paul consistently uses for death.
[time=3004] He uses it over in 1 Thessalonians, chapter four, when he says, I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those which are asleep.
[time=3013] And those that sleep with Jesus will God bring with him.
[time=3017] This is a reference to physical death.
[time=3020] It is possible according to the word of God for a Christian to so get out of fellowship with the Lord.
[time=3026] And so obstinately refuse any attempt to come back into fellowship with the Lord and to continue on in that state of sinning that God in his almighty power reaches down and pulls that person out of this life prematurely in death.
[time=3040] There comes a time when a Christian sins away his opportunity to continue being used of God in this world.
[time=3050] I think that is a serious matter that every Christian ought to be very concerned about.
[time=3056] The sin unto death is possible for every one of us.
[time=3061] It is possible for us to so get out of fellowship with God and reject any attempt to come back into fellowship with God that ultimately God looks and sees us in a place where he no longer can use us and where we're a stumbling block and for our own good and for our own cause.
[time=3076] He takes us out of this life in premature death.
[time=3081] Now that isn't a popular doctrine to teach but that is what the word of God teaches.
[time=3087] Now let me give you some perspective on how to handle this doctrine.
[time=3094] I cannot believe that any one would take advantage of this doctrine and go around identifying those that they think are in that state but unfortunately there are some Christians who feel that's what they ought to do.
[time=3106] First of all, I want you to notice that the Bible tells us we are not to judge others but we are to judge ourselves.
[time=3114] In fact, if you have your Bibles open to 1 Corinthians 11 it's very interesting that in the immediate context Paul says to us after he warns that many sleep.
[time=3124] 1 Corinthians 11, 30 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.
[time=3129] And then he says, and this is the key verse in the whole thing, verse 31.
[time=3133] For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.
[time=3138] In other words, God says if you believe that you might be in a situation where you have rejected God's grace in your own life in terms of repentance and renewed fellowship, if you see that, then God says judge it in your own life and if you do that you won't be judged.
[time=3153] But you go on, not judging that sin.
[time=3158] You go on rejecting what God has done for you and living as if you weren't even a Christian.
[time=3162] You go on sinning every day in the same consistent and determined way as a Christian.
[time=3170] And if you don't judge it yourself, God will.
[time=3172] Then I'd like to say to you secondly that in the same passages in 1 Corinthians he reminds us that even in his judging of us he has our good at heart.
[time=3183] He does not judge us to destroy us but notice what it says.
[time=3187] Verse 32, but if and when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world.
[time=3194] Even in this whole matter of the sin unto death
[time=3201] God gives us ample warning that we may be able to escape that judgment in our own lives.
[time=3208] I don't want any Christian going out of this auditorium saying I know so and so I believe they've sent the sin unto death, you don't know any such thing.
[time=3216] God didn't tell you to worry about so and so they told you to worry about yourself where you are, what you're doing and to judge yourself and to take care of that matter in your own life because if you don't judge it God says he will.
[time=3229] It's a very, very serious matter.
[time=3236] May I say to you lastly that though I have said the sin unto death is for Christians and not for unbelievers that for an unbeliever there is a sense in which sin is unto death for you.
[time=3250] The Bible says the wages of sin is death.
[time=3252] The Bible says that if you don't deal with your sin problem at the cross of Christ by accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior then you have bought yourself death, not physical death but spiritual death.
[time=3267] And so for all of us today there is a warning and an admonition and a matter of great concern shall we pray.
[time=3278] Father, in this passage of Scripture which we have tried to understand and explain there is an awesome warning to each of us and yet there is within the context the way of grace made plain.
[time=3293] Speak to hearts we pray in these closing moments with our heads bowed and our eyes closed.
[time=3298] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your personal savior right now wherever you are you may invite him into your life.
[time=3306] He has asked you to come in in openness and obedience to him and receive his free gift.
[time=3312] And if as a Christian you're out of fellowship with him right now why not get before the Lord in your own heart.
[time=3319] If you're watching by television just get on your knees before God and ask for his forgiveness.
[time=3323] Tell him you want to come back into fellowship and know once again the joy of your salvation that you once knew and he's anxious to have you back in fellowship with him.
[time=3333] He's given you the chance to judge your own life and I trust that you will do it today.
[time=3338] And Father, while we wait now before the in this church among these people we recognize the difficulty of this particular passage.
[time=3354] We have sensed in an uncommon way the attack of our adversary as we have tried to explain and share this passage.
[time=3363] We know that the struggle for.
