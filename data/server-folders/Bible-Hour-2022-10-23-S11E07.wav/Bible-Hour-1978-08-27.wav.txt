[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We present the Bible
[time=24] with Pastor David Jeremiah. [MUSIC]
[time=54] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=100] The greatest writer of the New Testament was the man Paul. Over 50 times in his books,
[time=107] some 13 of them, he mentions the fact that Jesus Christ is coming back again. As a pastor,
[time=113] I've had the privilege this past year of standing with those who are mourning over lost loved ones and sharing with them the great truth of the return of Christ. It is the believer's anchor
[time=124] and it is that to which we all look forward as we look into the future. And I want to share with you
[time=130] today from the Word of God the greatest passage in all of the scripture that talks about the rapture of the saints, the return of Christ for his own. In just a few moments, we'll be turning together to the book of First Thessalonians opening the pages of God's book and studying that great passage
[time=146] of scripture about the rapture of the saints. And I trust that you'll stay with us through this hour so that we might share with you the glorious truth of the return of Christ. First,
[time=156] we have some great music. And on today's program, and in this hour, we're going to be sharing the ministry of music of our own Black Hawk singers. This marks the end of the year of music for the Black Hawk singers. And we had the wonderful privilege just a few days ago of hearing an entire concert of their music on a Sunday evening. We've asked them to share with us in this service today some of the favorite music that has blessed our hearts throughout the year. So we're going to hear right now from our own Black Hawk singers. They sing for us a song entitled There's Just Something
[time=186] About My Jesus.
[time=196] There's Just Something About My Jesus. Something that I can't explain.
[time=204] For since I met this blessed Savior, my life has been so rearranged. If you're lucky for friendship and
[time=215] death, we're in peace. Just right in and you will see. There's Something About My Jesus. Something
[time=226] about My Lord. When at the first someone came and told me about Jesus, the Nazarene was
[time=237] said. He'd be everything anyone could ever be. I never knew. Well, I really didn't believe
[time=249] it until I met him for myself. And now I know just what they really mean. There's Just Something
[time=263] About My Jesus. Something that I can't explain. For since I met this blessed Savior, my life has been
[time=275] so rearranged. If you're lucky for friendship and death, we're in peace. Just right in and
[time=283] you will see. There's Something About My Jesus. Something About My Lord.
[time=294] No, it's a great, big, wonderful feeling. Now that I'm walking with my new father friend,
[time=302] and his love just keeps giving me to every day, every day. And you'll never know this joy
[time=313] of healing till you find him for yourself. And when you find him, you just have to say.
[time=326] There's Just Something About My Jesus. Something that I can't explain. For since I met this blessed
[time=336] Savior, my life has been so rearranged. If you're lucky for friendship and death,
[time=345] men at peace, just right in and you will see. There's Something About My Jesus.
[time=354] Yes, There's Something About My Jesus. There's Really Something About My Lord. My Lord. Something About You.
[time=377] This morning, I would like to read for you some selected verses from 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[time=384] concerning the coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead. There is one glory of the sun and
[time=391] another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, and one star differs from another star
[time=397] in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption. It is raised in
[time=404] corruption. It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness. It is raised in
[time=412] power. It is sown in natural body. It is raised as spiritual body. There is a natural body and
[time=419] there is a spiritual body. Behold, I show you a great mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[time=426] shall all be changed. In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the dead
[time=433] shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on in
[time=440] corruption and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall put on incorruption
[time=448] and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the same which is
[time=454] written, "Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
[time=463] victory? The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God who
[time=470] have given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
[time=477] steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For as much as you know that
[time=484] your labor is not in vain in the Lord." I have read to you today parts of 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=491] Thank you, Rick, for leading us in the Scripture. And now it's time again for us to hear from
[time=499] the Black Hawk Singers, one of the great truths that makes the resurrection of the dead possible and the certain hope of eternal life with the Lord Jesus Christ, a reality, is the truth of the cross of Jesus Christ. I suppose if I had to select some music that portrays my feeling
[time=516] about my Christian faith and perhaps one of the favorites of my repertoire of Black Hawk songs, I would select the number that the Black Hawk Singers are going to do now, for it is a collection of some music about Calvary. I trust you'll listen with your heart as the Black Hawk Singers share with us a Calvary medley.
[time=561] [MUSIC]
[time=587] Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer,
[time=596] Seems now I see, on Calvary's tree,
[time=606] who didn't believe, or sinners believe,
[time=615] Why they're gone healing,
[time=621] For me, for me, for me,
[time=654] For me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me,
[time=675] For me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me,
[time=717] [MUSIC]
[time=722] - During these days, we've had the wonderful privilege
[time=743] of greeting many people who have traveled to visit with us during the summer days here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=749] It's reminded us again that there's a great host of folks who share at the other end of this television ministry and are a part of our regular television family every single week.
[time=758] We thank you for sharing with us and encouraging us, letting us know that you're praying for us and that you're helping in the support of this ministry.
[time=766] I suppose that it's because of that group of people that we especially enjoy the opportunity to take these few moments during our offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, to communicate specifically with those of you who are watching at home.
[time=779] During this time, I like to share the special things that relate to you alone and to share with you those things that we're sending your way to encourage you and help you in your own personal study of the Word of God.
[time=790] It is my hope and prayer that the ministry on the Lord's Day through the Bible hour will simply be that which causes you to have a greater appetite for the Word of God will get you into the Scripture for yourself and cause you to become a real student of the Word itself.
[time=805] That's why the things that we send to you and we make available to you on the Bible hour are always materials which will help you and aid you in your own personal Bible study.
[time=816] Today I want to share with you again a very special little book that has been produced to help you get more from the Word of God.
[time=822] It's called an analytical survey of the Bible.
[time=825] It was put together by my friend Gerald Twombly from Grace Seminary and it's a very helpful volume to make the Bible understandable to those of all ages.
[time=834] You will find in the beginning of this book some general comments concerning the Bible as a whole and then throughout the book there's a special chapter on every one of the books of the Bible.
[time=844] For instance, in just a few moments I'm going to be preaching from the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=849] If you were to turn in this book to the chapter on 1 Thessalonians you would find some pertinent comments about the book itself.
[time=855] Here you would find an outline of the book, some of the specific things that are peculiar to the book of Thessalonians.
[time=861] You would discover that this particular introduction would help you to have a greater feeling for the Scripture as you begin to read it.
[time=869] This is just one of the many chapters that introduces the various books of the Bible and this particular handbook of the Bible is available to you today if you will just get in touch with us.
[time=879] We would count it a great privilege to send it into your home free and postage paid if you will just write to us or get in touch with us today.
[time=887] However, once in a while I meet people who say, Pastor Dave, I thought about writing you.
[time=891] We just never have gotten around to it.
[time=893] We've created a special way of contact for those of you who particularly are having a hard time with letters and that particular contact means is the means of the 800 number which has been established recently to aid and help us in the Bible hour ministry.
[time=909] That particular number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=914] That means that you could go to your phone right now, pick up your phone and dial this toll free number and ask for the Bible hour office when the operator answers, tell her that you would like to receive the free Bible study booklet from the Bible hour this week and the operator will get in touch with us.
[time=930] We'll have your name and address and this week we will mail to you your own personal copy of the Analytical Bible Survey.
[time=936] Let me give you that number again.
[time=938] It's 1-800-247-2160.
[time=942] It is toll free any place in the United States and you may call that number today or any day this week and let our operators there know that you'd appreciate having this free literature in your home.
[time=952] If the telephone number is busy, keep trying and eventually you'll get through.
[time=956] I know that this particular means of contact has been helpful to many people.
[time=960] Each week we receive many dozens of calls from folks who are requesting the free Bible study literature that we offer on this telecast.
[time=968] And then of course, if you would rather write to us, we always appreciate hearing from you because you can communicate to us in more detail.
[time=975] Sharing with us what God is doing in your life through the Bible hour ministry and we trust that you will take a moment this week if you have time to sit down and drop us a note.
[time=983] When you write, you should write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=991] Once again, that's Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=998] We appreciate so much your response to us during these days.
[time=1001] These are difficult days for the television ministry.
[time=1004] The summer has almost ended.
[time=1005] Soon we'll be back in school and the routine will be established, but I would like to encourage you to make a special effort to write to us this week.
[time=1013] We need to hear from you and your letters of encouragement reminding us that you're praying for us and your gifts of support are very helpful to us, especially at this time.
[time=1023] We are most interested in hearing from those who have never written before.
[time=1027] If you have never written to the Bible hour and you're part of our television audience today, I'd like to ask you personally this week to sit down and write me a letter and let me know that you're sharing in this ministry.
[time=1039] Communication is a cycle, not a one-way street, and it cannot be completed until you close the loop and get back to us, letting us know that we're reaching your home and trust we're reaching your heart as well.
[time=1052] Now in just a few moments, we're going to open the Word of God and share the truth of the coming again of Christ.
[time=1058] I hope you'll be able to stay with us through the remaining of this hour so that we can study together this great truth concerning the return and rapture of our Savior.
[time=1066] I trust that this hour has been a blessing already, and I would encourage you again to get in touch with us this week and let us know that you're a part of our great family of listeners and viewers who share this telecast with us.
[time=1078] Once again, the telephone number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1088] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"]
[time=1118] Thank you for that good music and for your participation
[time=1137] in congregational singing.
[time=1138] It's always a joy to share together in singing praises to the Lord.
[time=1142] The Scripture tells us that the earth itself cries out for the return of Christ.
[time=1148] The Bible tells us that all of God's creation groaneth until the day of redemption.
[time=1152] There's coming a day, according to the music we are about to hear, that even the earth will sing the praises of the Lord.
[time=1158] Listen carefully as the Black Hawk singer share with us a beautiful song entitled, "The Earth Will Sing." [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"]
[time=1175] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ"] When Jesus comes to reign in glory, the earth will sing,
[time=1195] the redemption story, the creation will ring with joyful
[time=1208] cries.
[time=1210] From every nation a song of joy shall rise.
[time=1219] There'll be no grief.
[time=1222] There'll be no crying.
[time=1237] There'll be a new world.
[time=1241] All things will pass away.
[time=1245] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"]
[time=1290] There'll be no grief.
[time=1292] There'll be no crying.
[time=1306] There'll be a new world.
[time=1311] All things will pass away in the eternal day.
[time=1322] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"]
[time=1335] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"] [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers, for that music and for the reminder again of all of those things which shall be our heritage as we look to the future.
[time=1350] One of the favorite soloists in the Black Hawk Singers is a young man who has been with him since the very beginning of this group, David Miller is his name.
[time=1359] And he has a special song that he sings.
[time=1362] It's one of my favorites.
[time=1363] It's entitled, "It is Well with My Soul." I trust that as you look forward to the coming of Christ and as you anticipate his return to this earth, if it should be today, that you can say with full assurance, it's all right with my soul, or as another hymn writer has said it, there's nothing between my soul and the Savior.
[time=1380] Listen and enter in now to the music of David Miller as he shares with us the great hymn, "It is Well with My Soul." [MUSIC - "Prayed Jesus Christ in Christ in Christ"] In peace like a river, a tenderth my way, when sorrows
[time=1412] like sea billows roll, whatever my love thou has taught me
[time=1426] to say, "It is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=1439] it is well with my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=1463] my sin, o' the bliss of that glorious thought,
[time=1474] my sin not in part, but the whole is nailed to the cross,
[time=1487] and I bear it no more, praise the Lord,
[time=1496] praise the Lord, oh my soul, it is well with my soul,
[time=1515] it is well, it is well with my soul,
[time=1527] it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul,
[time=1585] it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=1615] We open your Bibles tonight to the fourth chapter of First Thessalonians, where we shall
[time=1630] read together probably the most familiar portion of this great book, First Thessalonians
[time=1636] chapter 4 verses 13 through 18, "But I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning
[time=1647] them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others who have no hope, for if we believe
[time=1654] that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[time=1660] him, for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede them who are asleep, for the Lord himself
[time=1671] shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=1681] Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord, wherefore comfort one another
[time=1693] with these words.
[time=1696] Some years ago a tourist was traveling along the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy.
[time=1702] When he reached the Castle Villas Conte, there he found a friendly old gardener who opened
[time=1709] the gates of that old palace and showed him the grounds which this old gardener had kept
[time=1716] in most beautiful condition.
[time=1719] The tourist asked this gardener when the owner appeared on the grounds and the gardener said
[time=1725] the last time I saw him here was twelve years ago.
[time=1729] "Does he ever write to you?" said the tourist.
[time=1732] "No." "Well from where do you receive your instructions?" The old gardener said I received them from his agent in Milan.
[time=1742] "Does he come?" said the tourist.
[time=1746] "Never." "Who then comes here?" said the tourist.
[time=1751] "I am almost always alone," said the gardener.
[time=1756] Only once in a while a tourist comes as you have today to bang upon the door of this old villa.
[time=1764] Tourist with a question mark upon his face said, "But you keep this garden in such fine condition just as though you expected your master to come tomorrow and the gardener interrupted
[time=1775] him and said today, sir, today, I expect him today."
[time=1783] It is in the thought of that particular story coming to us out of the human interest of
[time=1790] the past that we reflect upon the attitude of this passage of Scripture which we have before us in this hour.
[time=1799] That gardener was awaiting his commander.
[time=1802] He was awaiting his leader not tomorrow or the next day, but he expected him at any moment.
[time=1809] Those of us who believe the Bible understand that this expectant spirit, the waiting for
[time=1816] the imminent return of Christ, is a part of our heritage.
[time=1820] We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ could come back at any moment.
[time=1824] There is not anything yet to happen on the horizon of prophecy that must take place before
[time=1830] Jesus Christ comes back to this earth.
[time=1834] In this day and age when men do not believe the Bible, and when churches do not preach the Bible, and when prophecy is laughed at and scoffed at by many who claim to be religious,
[time=1845] it is important that we go back again to remind ourselves of the fact that prophecy is one-fourth
[time=1851] of the Bible.
[time=1852] Twenty-five percent of all that is written in this book that you and I claim to believe is written concerning the coming again of Christ, either in his rapture or at the second advent.
[time=1862] All but four of twenty-seven New Testament books refer to the coming again of the Lord
[time=1868] Jesus Christ.
[time=1870] Where in the New Testament the atonement is mentioned once.
[time=1874] The second coming is mentioned twice.
[time=1877] Where in the New Testament the first coming of Christ at Bethlehem is mentioned once.
[time=1882] The second coming of Christ in the rapture is mentioned nine times.
[time=1888] Paul the Apostle who has written almost all of the New Testament apart from the Gospels and Acts and a few other selected books mentions the second coming of Christ fifty times in
[time=1899] his writings.
[time=1901] In the 216 chapters of the New Testament once in every twenty-five verses there is a reference
[time=1907] to the fact that Jesus Christ is coming back to this earth three hundred and eighteen times
[time=1913] the writers of the New Testament refer to the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1920] It is interesting to study the records of the early church and to find out that the early church had an unvarnished love for the truth of the second coming of our Lord and Savior.
[time=1931] It seemed that they all lived with the hope of the promise that the Lord shared with us through the writings of Paul to Timothy.
[time=1939] For in the book of Second Timothy chapter four and verses seven and eight Paul wrote to Timothy and he said, "I want you to know that I have fought a good fight.
[time=1948] I have finished my course.
[time=1950] I have kept the faith.
[time=1951] Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give to me at that day and not to me only but notice unto all them that love
[time=1963] he is appearing.
[time=1965] The Lord Jesus Christ so wanted us to follow in the teaching of the second coming of Christ
[time=1971] that he has reserved a special crown for those who love the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1977] It is one of the five crowns of the New Testament called the crown of righteousness.
[time=1981] When we stand before the bemacy that crown will be distributed to those who have had a special place in their heart for the second coming of Christ as did Paul.
[time=1991] Now throughout the Bible there are consistent promises from different sources that Jesus
[time=1997] Christ would come back again to this earth.
[time=2000] The most famous of all of these promises is found in the book of John.
[time=2003] You need not turn to it.
[time=2005] Most of you know it by heart.
[time=2007] From the words of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior we have in John 14 1 to 3 these words.
[time=2013] As he addressed his disciples who were fearful at his appending death they said, "Let not your hearts be trouble." He believed in God.
[time=2021] Believe also in me.
[time=2023] Our Lord said, "In my Father's house are many mansions.
[time=2026] If it were not so I would have told you.
[time=2029] I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may also be and I will come again
[time=2036] to receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also." Those are the words of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2043] But he is not the only one who promised the coming again of the Savior.
[time=2047] In the first chapter of the book of Acts and verse 11 we have the promise of the angels.
[time=2052] Those disciples their hearts broken because the Lord had been taken out of their midst were standing on the Mount of Olives looking up into the heavens from whence the Savior had gone.
[time=2062] And as they looked at the departure of our Savior the angels came to minister to them and they said, "Emen of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
[time=2073] This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." And so the angels promised that Jesus would come again.
[time=2085] And then you open the pages of the New Testament and you discover that consistently the apostles promised that Jesus would come again.
[time=2093] For instance the apostle Peter writes in chapter 1 of the first book of Peter verse 7.
[time=2098] He writes these words, "That the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gall that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
[time=2108] honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ." Later on in 1 Peter he writes again, "Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking
[time=2118] the oversight thereof, not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy looker, but of a ready mind, neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock.
[time=2129] Now listen, and when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away." First Peter chapter 5 verses 2 through 4.
[time=2139] Peter promised that Christ would come back again.
[time=2143] James the apostle wrote concerning the coming again of Christ in chapter 5 verses 7 and
[time=2149] 8 of the book that bears his name, be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord." He wrote, "Behold, the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it until he received the early in the latter reign.
[time=2162] Be also patient, stablish your hearts for the coming of the Lord, drawth nigh."
[time=2168] Those are the words of James.
[time=2170] John the apostle wrote concerning the second coming of Christ.
[time=2174] In 1 John chapter 3 verses 2 and 3 he wrote, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is, and every man that hath this hope in him purify
[time=2191] of himself even as he is pure." In the last verses of the New Testament in that book we call the revelation of St. John.
[time=2201] We read the words of John as he closed out the canon of the New Testament and he wrote these words, Revelation 22 verse 20, "He which testifyeth these things saith surely I come
[time=2213] quickly, Amen, even so come, Lord Jesus." So the pages of the New Testament close were the promise of John that Jesus Christ is coming back to this earth.
[time=2225] And what shall we say about the apostle Paul who has written the book of 1 Thessalonians which we are studying?
[time=2231] In that other passage which goes along with 1 Thessalonians 4, 1 Corinthians chapter 15, Paul wrote these words, "Behold I show you a mystery, we shall not all sleep, but
[time=2242] we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for
[time=2249] the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall all be changed." 1 Corinthians 15, 51 and 52, "Throughout the New Testament the apostles, the angels, Jesus
[time=2264] Himself, promised that Christ would come back to this earth again.
[time=2270] But not alone in the Bible is this testimony to be found.
[time=2274] For in the early church, just after the apostles passed off the scene, there were great men of faith like Justin Martyr and Arrhenius who taught that the rapture would occur.
[time=2285] There was a period of time in church history when the rapture fell out of the doctrinal teaching of its day.
[time=2291] Many scholars believe that it had to do with a man by the name of Origen who came upon the history of the church and developed what came to be known as the allegorical interpretation
[time=2302] of the Bible, the spiritualization of the Bible truth.
[time=2305] He taught that this truth concerning the coming again of Jesus Christ was only a metaphor that we could understand in some other way.
[time=2313] He spiritualized the truth out of it and then there was a man who learned under his teaching a man by the name of Augustine who became one of the great fathers of the Roman church.
[time=2323] Augustine, imbibing deeply from the streams of Origen's teaching, set down with pen in hand and wrote the great work, the city of God.
[time=2332] And in this work he pictured the final supremacy of the church over the evil of its day and
[time=2339] he totally destroyed any context into which the rapture could fit.
[time=2343] And for years the doctrine of the coming again of Christ and the rapture of the saints was not taught.
[time=2350] But those of us who are Protestants know that there came a day when the Reformation took place and men such as Luther and Zwingli and other men like Wycliffe and Huss and Latimer
[time=2360] began to unfold the scriptures again and the Bible was put back into the hands of the common people and as they began to study the pages of this book they found this truth of the rapture to be so clear that they could not deny it and once again the doctrine of the second coming of Christ began to be taught among the masses.
[time=2378] Need I say tonight that the darkest hour in the history of the church was the hour when
[time=2384] the doctrine of the second coming of Christ went underground it was not taught, for there is no greater motivation to holy living in a sanctified life than the realization that Jesus Christ could come back today and all of the scriptures in every place consistently
[time=2400] portray that the purpose of our doctrine of the coming of Christ is that we might live daily lives which are holy and pleasing unto the Lord.
[time=2409] Now in the New Testament the two main passages that teach that truth are the passage that we are looking at tonight and 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=2418] 1 Corinthians 15 deals with the physical aspects of the return of Christ.
[time=2423] We will not look at that tonight.
[time=2425] It deals with how our bodies are changed and how that process takes place.
[time=2430] 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13 to 18 deals with the result of the Lord's return.
[time=2436] What is it that's going to take place because Jesus Christ comes back?
[time=2440] Now I know that this is a familiar passage and that you have studied it and read it and we have preached from it many times.
[time=2447] It is often a passage that God gives to us as we stand at the deathbed of some beloved
[time=2454] one.
[time=2455] It has been the subject and text of many a funeral message but that is not the main purpose of it tonight.
[time=2461] The main purpose is that it might encourage those of us who are walking along life's way that we might know God better and understand His purpose for our lives in a more emphatic and exact way.
[time=2473] I want to share with you two things that are the result of the coming of Christ from this passage.
[time=2478] They are simple things and yet wrapped up in these two things is the totality of all of human life for a Christian.
[time=2485] The first thing that results when the Lord comes back is that there is a reunion with our loved ones who have already gone to be with the Lord.
[time=2492] And the second thing is that we are united with the Lord forever.
[time=2496] Now stop and think about it for a moment.
[time=2498] Your personal loved ones, your family and your personal relationship with the Lord, your Savior.
[time=2504] What else is there in all of life except those two things that call us to a consideration
[time=2511] of this passage of Scripture?
[time=2513] The first thing that Paul does is he writes to the Thessalonians is to share with them the truth of the reunion with loved ones.
[time=2522] Back in the seventeenth chapter of the book of Acts, which we won't turn to now but let me just refresh your memory, Paul had made a visit to Thessalonica and there he had taught the Thessalonians from the Word and apparently in his teaching he had begun to teach them about the fact that there was going to be a special resurrection that Christ was coming back to take his own.
[time=2541] And the Thessalonians believers who heard that began to think about it and meditate upon it and Paul left and went on to minister elsewhere and as they turned this doctrine over in their minds they began to be worried.
[time=2552] For some of those Thessalonians believers had laid to rest some dear loved ones who had known the Lord.
[time=2557] They had gone to the cemetery as we have done on occasion during this past year and there they had laid to rest someone that they loved, some Christian father or mother or brother or sister.
[time=2566] And when they began to hear about the fact that Christ was coming back for his own their thoughts immediately went to the cemetery and they began to think well if Christ comes
[time=2576] back for his own and my loved ones are in the grave what will become of them?
[time=2581] And so Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians to explain to them what would happen to their loved ones who had already died and that's why he writes in verse 13, "I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning those who were asleep but you don't have to sorrow even as others who have no hope for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him." Now in this text Paul uses a very endearing term for the death of a Christian loved one.
[time=2610] He uses the term sleep.
[time=2612] It is that word which he used when he referred to Lazarus in John chapter 11, remember?
[time=2617] He said, "Lazareth sleepeth." Now Lazarus wasn't asleep physically for the scriptures very clear that he already had begun to have an aroma of death.
[time=2627] In fact the scripture says he stinketh.
[time=2629] He had already begun the process of decomposition.
[time=2632] He was asleep.
[time=2633] That means he was dead in Christ.
[time=2636] And when he refers in this passage of scripture to those who are asleep he is talking about Christians who have died.
[time=2642] Someone has written that the reference to sleep for a Christian is a very interesting one because when you sleep you're supposed to wake up refreshed.
[time=2652] I want to tell you something when a Christian goes to sleep in the grave one day the trumpet is going to sound and he's going to wake up refreshed in the presence of the Lord.
[time=2660] The Bible says those who sleep with Jesus are those who have died in Christ.
[time=2666] Now this is a reference only to the body.
[time=2669] There are some today who like to tell us that when we die our soul goes to sleep too.
[time=2674] In fact there is a cult which has built a great deal of business on the sleeping of the soul.
[time=2680] Obviously he's not talking here about our soul going to sleep because that contradicts many passages in the New Testament.
[time=2686] The writings of Paul himself where he wrote that for him to be absent from the body was to be present with the Lord.
[time=2692] His soul was going to go to heaven.
[time=2694] But when we die our bodies go in the grave, our souls go to be with the Lord.
[time=2698] Our bodies go to sleep according to Paul.
[time=2701] This reference to the sleeping of the body.
[time=2704] Now notice that Jesus Christ ties the resurrection of the Christian directly with his own personal
[time=2711] resurrection.
[time=2712] He says that the fact that those bodies are going to come out of the grave is significant because it's just exactly what happened to Jesus Christ.
[time=2720] He says, "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep
[time=2728] in Jesus will God bring with him." Now let me read the verse this way.
[time=2733] If we believe that Jesus died and rose again likewise and in the same manner those that
[time=2740] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
[time=2744] Sleeping saints are to be brought back from the grave in the same way that Jesus was resurrected.
[time=2750] Now how was he resurrected?
[time=2752] The Scripture says he was brought back from the grave in power of his own power.
[time=2756] He came back from the grave.
[time=2758] It was a display of the power of God.
[time=2760] And the Scripture tells us that when Christ comes back from heaven there is going to be a display of God's power that will cause the grave of every Christian to open and the bodies of dead Christians to be resurrected in the same dynamic power that brought Jesus Christ back from the grave on that first Easter Sunday.
[time=2780] That's why 1 Corinthians chapter 15 in verse 23 says that Jesus Christ is the first fruits
[time=2786] of the resurrection.
[time=2787] He came out of the grave to assure us that when we die we're going to come out of the grave at the right time.
[time=2793] His resurrection guarantees my resurrection.
[time=2796] His resurrection from the grave is the absolute proof positive that if you should die before the Lord comes back you will not be left in that grave to rot.
[time=2804] You will come back in resurrection to be with the Lord forever.
[time=2809] He's going to resurrect us.
[time=2811] It is impossible.
[time=2814] You see for the body of Christ to be dead if the head is alive.
[time=2820] Jesus Christ is alive and we are His body and the living head can't have a dead body.
[time=2826] So we're still living and Christ is going to resurrect us and that body will be reunited with the head and the Scripture puts it this way Christ own words because I live, ye shall
[time=2836] live also.
[time=2838] Now the Bible tells us that there's great comfort in this truth.
[time=2844] At the end of this passage of Scripture we have this addendum.
[time=2847] Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
[time=2850] You say pastor how could there ever be comfort in the reference to death?
[time=2854] I tell you there's great comfort in that because you see death is not the end.
[time=2860] The grave is not the period behind a life.
[time=2864] It is just a hallway through which a Christian walks on his way to eternity with the Lord forever and therefore when we can explain this truth about God's plan for His children after this life there is great comfort to be had in that.
[time=2877] I have seen the expressions on morning saints change just from the truth presented from this passage of Scripture.
[time=2885] I want to share with you that the loss of a loved one is a soul-shocking experience.
[time=2890] If you haven't gone through that in your own family be prepared for it because it will catch up with all of us should the Lord tear it.
[time=2897] It is a soul-shocking experience.
[time=2900] There is not anything we are asked ever to endure that is more difficult than to lose somebody we love in death.
[time=2907] I want to tell you that the graves of every Christian who has died are lined with hope.
[time=2914] The grave of every Christian who has died is a grave that is lined with hope.
[time=2920] I am told that the Navajo Indians in New Mexico are so fearful of death that when someone
[time=2927] becomes deathly ill they evacuate the house and leave the sick one all by himself there
[time=2936] to die.
[time=2939] Tradition tells us that when that death finally occurs they go back to the house and they
[time=2945] burn it down along with all of the belongings of the deceased one because they fear that somehow the spirit of that one who is departed will come back again into life to haunt them or to cause them difficulty and so they destroy all evidences of death so they won't have to think about it anymore.
[time=2963] I know some who are not as learned as that and some who are more learned than that that
[time=2969] fear death equally as well.
[time=2972] Some of the great philosophers of our generation and generations past have tried to sum up their fear and their despair at the thought of death.
[time=2981] Will Durant has written an exposé called "On the meaning of life" listen to what he says he says "Life has become a pitiful population of human insects on earth a planetary eczema
[time=2993] that may soon be cured nothing is certain except defeat and death a sleep from which
[time=3000] there is no awakening it is impossible he wrote to give life a meaning that cannot be
[time=3006] annulled by death." That's what a man wrote who did not know Jesus Christ and another man wrote.
[time=3016] A man by the name of Bertrand Russell and noted in Fidel an atheist he wrote these words
[time=3022] concerning life apart from Jesus Christ.
[time=3025] He said the life of man is a long march through the night surrounded by invisible foes tortured
[time=3032] by weariness and pain toward a goal which few can hope to reach and where none can tear
[time=3038] along.
[time=3040] And by one as they march our comrades vanished from sight seized by the silent orders of omnipotent
[time=3047] death, brief and powerless his man's life.
[time=3051] On him and all his race the slow sure doom falls pitiless and dark.
[time=3056] Blind to good and evil reckless of destruction omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless
[time=3062] way for man condemned today to lose his dearest tomorrow himself to pass through the gate of darkness it remains only to cherish air yet the blow falls the lofty thoughts that ennoble
[time=3074] his little day.
[time=3076] What was he saying Bertrand Russell was saying that all we have is the now this moment we better cherish what it is because there is nothing to look forward to but death and defeat
[time=3087] and ultimate destruction.
[time=3090] I want to say to you that the Christians hope is not to be found in the words of an infidel
[time=3096] but in the words of the Scripture and that's why we find written in the last verse of this
[time=3102] great chapter wherefore comforgy one another with these words and I can say to that woman
[time=3108] who has lost her husband and that man who has lost his wife and that family that has lost a dear child and that lover who has lost the one who is the apple of her eye that
[time=3120] though it is hard and painful and difficult to face the soul shattering experience of death that there is still hope beyond the grave for Jesus Christ is coming back and one day there shall be a reunion with those that we have lost.
[time=3135] The Bible says that when Christ comes back the dead in Christ are going to be raised
[time=3141] and they are going to be brought up from the grave ahead of those of us who remain and are alive and be reunited in the air with the Lord.
[time=3150] We used to sing as I was growing up a great old hymn there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet, sweet by and by and I want to tell you that there is going to be some glad reunions among people from this earth who have lost those ahead of time and
[time=3166] they are going to meet one another in the air and there is going to be a great family reunion of all those who have been separated from a loved one.
[time=3175] In the book a man called Peter, Catherine Marshall writes these words.
[time=3183] She said that on the night that her beloved Peter became ill, she was distressed and
[time=3192] as his illness grew more serious she was filled with despair, very seldom did she leave his
[time=3198] bedside often with him for long hours at a time.
[time=3203] One night after she had been with him a night and a day before that time she felt she must go and get some rest and so she leaned over to tell him good night and he looked up to
[time=3214] her and said, "Catherine I will see you in the morning" and she went home to rest.
[time=3221] Before the night was over the phone rang and she picked up the phone and it was someone from the hospital telling her that her beloved Peter Marshall had passed out of this life
[time=3232] into the next.
[time=3233] Catherine writing in her book says that it wasn't until the next summer as she was seated upon the shore vacationing and trying to recover from the loss that she had sustained,
[time=3243] that the thought came to her.
[time=3247] He probably knew what he was saying.
[time=3250] He probably really understood what he was saying when he said, "Catherine I will see you in the morning" and she wrote, "and I shall see him in the morning" in that great morning
[time=3261] of resurrection when Jesus comes back to call to himself his own.
[time=3266] That's the hope of the Christian.
[time=3268] That's why the grave of every departed saint is lined with hope and the tombstone may give
[time=3274] the facts of a change in a transition but it does not in any way declare the finality
[time=3281] to a human life.
[time=3284] Whereas this passage of Scripture closes with a word of encouragement for those who are Christians.
[time=3290] The unwritten word is one of warning and judgment for those who do not know the Lord.
[time=3296] Before the hours of this night are over, the trump of God could sound, the voice of the
[time=3302] archangel could be heard, the dead in Christ could rise from the grave and those who are
[time=3309] alive and remain who are Christians be caught up to be with the Lord and it will be forever too late to be saved.
[time=3316] I want to say to you that eternity's decisions are made in time and though you may reckon
[time=3322] on another day to decide to go to heaven, the only time you have is the time God has
[time=3329] given you right now.
[time=3331] Everyone who is in heaven will be there because in time they decided for Christ.
[time=3338] What are you going to do with him tonight?
