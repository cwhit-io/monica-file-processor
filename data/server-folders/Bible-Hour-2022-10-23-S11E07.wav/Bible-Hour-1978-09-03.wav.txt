[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=12] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=18] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=24] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=38] What is the most difficult lesson for God to teach his children?
[time=43] I'm certain that if I ask you that question there would be many separate and differing responses, but I am personally convinced that the most difficult lesson for all of us to
[time=53] learn as Christians is the lesson of our ineffectiveness without total dependence upon the Lord.
[time=60] Our Lord put it this way in the Scripture, without me you can do nothing.
[time=65] And God has to work on all of us for years at a time before finally that lesson settles
[time=71] in to be a truth in our hearts.
[time=74] I want to share with you today from the Word of God one of the avenues of teaching that our Lord used to impress this very important lesson upon his disciples, and we'll be looking together at the 21st chapter of the Book of John, one of the great portions of the gospel narrative, and I trust your heart will be prepared as we open the Scriptures in a few moments
[time=95] to study God's Word to us today.
[time=97] First we have some exciting music, and we're happy to introduce to you today by way of his direction of the choir, our new minister of music, Mr. Donald Kruger.
[time=107] We'll be getting very acquainted with him and the days ahead.
[time=109] We're so grateful for God's supply of his ministry to us, and he leads our choir today for the first time as they sing a song about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=137] God, your love is Jesus, God, your love is my nurse, God, your love is their sing.
[time=157] He is also wonderful to me.
[time=164] Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful is Jesus, wonderful is goodness, wonderful is wisdom.
[time=190] He is also wonderful to me.
[time=195] Wonderful, wonderful is Jesus, wonderful is Jesus, wonderful is wisdom, wonderful is
[time=219] wonderful is wisdom, wonderful is Jesus, wonderful is wisdom, wonderful is wisdom.
[time=271] Wonderful is he.
[time=288] The choir has turned our eyes to the one whom Isaiah called the wonderful, the Lord Jesus
[time=294] Christ, and it's fitting this morning that we would read the words of the Lord Jesus Christ as they're found in John chapter 15 verses one through five.
[time=303] I would like to read for you this morning those verses.
[time=307] I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[time=312] Every branch in me that bear not fruit he takes away and every branch that bears fruit
[time=319] he prunes it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[time=324] How are you clean through the word which I have spoken unto you?
[time=330] Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the
[time=338] vine.
[time=339] No more can you except you abide in me.
[time=343] I am the vine you are the branches he that abides in me and I in him the same brings forth
[time=351] much fruit for without me you can do nothing.
[time=355] I have read for you this morning the words of the Lord Jesus Christ as they're found in John chapter 15.
[time=364] Thank you Rick for reading the Scripture and Don Kruger for your ministry to us through
[time=370] the voices of the choir.
[time=373] During these summer months it has been basically the responsibility of our Black Hawk Singers
[time=379] to carry the burden of music and they have done it so well.
[time=383] We so appreciate them and thank God for their ministry to us faithfully each week, a group of talented lay people that God has brought together under his good hand and used them to many times encourage our hearts.
[time=397] How often we have found in our own experience that God meets us at a time of trouble.
[time=402] The song they have chosen to sing today is a spiritual that speaks to us of the ministry
[time=408] of the Lord Jesus Christ to our hearts when we reach out to him in the midst of difficulty and the waters are parted and we see that the Lord has been there all the time.
[time=438] We are the long ways around me come to see.
[time=449] When I cry for help or hear me Lord and hold out your hand, touch my life still the raging
[time=459] storm in me.
[time=476] Knowing you loved me through the burden I must bear hearing your footsteps.
[time=487] And in the night of my life you'll bring the promise of day here is my hand to show me
[time=505] what I love and what I love and what I love and what I love and what I love and what
[time=618] touch my life still the raging storm in me.
[time=639] We're so grateful for the privilege of sharing these few moments with you during the middle of our service today and first of all we want to thank you for being part of the Bible hour and for sharing this particular hour of ministry in your own home.
[time=651] We counted a great privilege to meet with you each week and to share with you the unsearchable riches of God's Word and this personal time of fellowship and I am most grateful to welcome
[time=662] back to this little time together my wife Donna we've had so many letters from people wondering what was wrong with you and where you were and in order to make sure that everybody understands that we're still together and that we are ministering together you better give them an update on what's been happening with you over these past weeks.
[time=680] Well the Lord decided that I needed some time to rest and think I guess because he saw fit
[time=686] to put me on my back for five weeks with mononucleosis and it's been a trying time in many respects
[time=692] with four children to take care of but it's really been a rewarding time to me to see how many people really care and the people in our church and our community have just been super
[time=703] about taking care of the children and sending in food and it's really great to know that
[time=709] Christians have other Christians who care.
[time=711] That's true and Donna if they noticed that we look quite healthy at this point in time there are two reasons first of all everybody who sent in food sent in more than enough and their very best dish which we all sampled and had a great time eating and secondly we just returned from two weeks of vacation in Ocean City where we had a chance to really catch up on our rest and we're ready to go.
[time=731] I might add that during this time I've changed more diapers than I ever dreamed of and more than I ever hoped to change again in my life so you stay healthy so we can move ahead together in these days.
[time=742] During this time we like to share together with those who are watching at home a very special Bible study tool that we make available free and postage paid each week and this week
[time=752] we're happy to introduce what I think is one of the most exciting little Bible study tools that we want to send to you at home one of the most exciting we've ever offered.
[time=761] It's a little book entitled Four Hundred Questions and Answers on the Bible and this study help
[time=767] is yours for the asking if you will just get in touch with us and let us know that you would like to have it.
[time=773] Let me take just a moment and Donna you help me will you to share with them the details of what's inside the covers of this study booklet.
[time=780] Okay first of all I'm going to get started on the right foot by correcting you.
[time=784] You said four hundred they're four thousand thousand okay that's better yet.
[time=789] It starts out and has each chapter of the Bible in order and if you're studying a particular book of the Bible it's say for instance you have open here to Exodus if you're studying
[time=800] in Exodus you just pick up this booklet and go to the passage that you're studying and it has questions on that passage of scripture and not only does it have the questions but it has the answers too.
[time=810] I think that's one of the most exciting things for me because so many times when you're studying a passage the questions that you have you go to a question and answer book and those particular questions aren't there or they're very difficult to find.
[time=823] This book has them chronologically in order so that as you work your way through the Bible you can find the questions on that passage and the answers are right there.
[time=830] This should be so helpful because we get so many letters from people who watch with Bible questions it takes all of our staff really to keep up with the letters we get answering the questions people have about the Bible.
[time=842] Many of the answers to the questions you have you'll find in this little book four thousand questions and answers from the Bible.
[time=849] There are some other study helps in the back of it that we'll talk to you about later but we'd like to have the privilege of sending this book to you this week.
[time=856] We have them here ready to mail out as soon as we get your request and I'd like for you to write to me or get in touch with us this week and say please send me my personal copy of four thousand questions and answers on the Bible.
[time=868] Now let's tell them how to get in touch with us.
[time=871] If you would prefer you may call us toll free at 1-800-247-2160.
[time=879] Once again it's a toll free number 1-800-247-2160 or if you prefer you may write to us write
[time=888] to pastor David Jeremiah post office box 1-5-250-Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=895] Now I want to emphasize to all of our many friends that this is a toll free number that they use and the 800 number is something they can call from any place anywhere and just pick up the phone dial 1-800-247-2160 and an operator will answer and when the operator answers
[time=912] you be sure to say we would like the Bible Hour office and they will give you a special operator who will take down your name and address and then pass it on to us the very next day so that we in turn can send your literature to you free and postage paid.
[time=926] There is absolutely no responsibility for you to send an offering if you want this book.
[time=931] Obviously it costs money for us to be on the air and we appreciate so much the many people who have responded by giving to help support the Bible Hour but it is not necessary for you to make a gift or an offering to get your booklet this week.
[time=945] We want to hear from you and we want the privilege of extending ourselves into your home through this literature and making it available to you this week.
[time=952] Now before we sign off and get back to the morning service let me once again remind you that the telephone number you should use to get in touch with us is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=963] Why don't you write it down and go to your phone as soon as the Bible Hour is off the air and call them and let them know you would like to have your copy of this special book 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible this week.
[time=975] We'd love to hear from you and we'll be looking forward to getting your call this week and I trust that you will make sure to get the number correctly write it down and then call us as soon as you have an opportunity.
[time=986] Now in just a few moments we're going to be opening the Bible to the book of John John's Gospel chapter 21 and I'm going to preach a first message in a series of messages on
[time=997] serving the Lord Jesus Christ the futility of self-centered service.
[time=1002] I trust you'll be with us as we open the scriptures in just a moment.
[time=1027] [MUSIC]
[time=1057] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1063] For those of you who are sharing our service locally by television we want to extend to you this invitation to join us beginning on the 10th of September for an evangelism and
[time=1075] missionary enrichment conference which will feature the ministry of Dr. Layman Strauss.
[time=1080] He will be speaking here in our facilities on Sunday night next week and then on Monday
[time=1086] Tuesday and Wednesday he will be ministering the Word of God here and you are cordially invited to share with us this great time of Bible teaching from one of our country's ablest Bible expositors.
[time=1098] We're grateful again for the ministry of our Black Hawk Singers and they share with us now a song of testimony "Jesus is all the world to me."
[time=1128] Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all.
[time=1144] He is my strength from day to day without you I would call.
[time=1161] When I am set to hear my goal no other one can cheer me so.
[time=1176] When I am set he makes me glad he is my friend.
[time=1191] Jesus is all the world to me and true to him I'll be.
[time=1215] Oh how could I this friend be now where he's so true to me.
[time=1231] Father we hear you I know I'm right He watches all the day and now.
[time=1246] Father we hear you I am right He is my friend.
[time=1264] Jesus is all the world to me I want no better friend.
[time=1287] I trust him now I'll trust him when life's fleeting day shall end.
[time=1302] Beautiful life with such a prayer, beautiful life that has no way.
[time=1317] He turn all the way, he turn all the joy, he's my friend.
[time=1342] My friend.
[time=1350] He's my friend.
[time=1372] Thank you for your help in introducing us to the message of the Word of God and let
[time=1381] us take our Bibles and turn to John's Gospel and the 21st chapter, John's Gospel, Chapter
[time=1388] 21.
[time=1392] And I want to read beginning at the first verse simply the first five verses of this closing
[time=1398] chapter of the Gospel of John.
[time=1401] One chapter 21 verses one through five.
[time=1406] After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberius and
[time=1412] on this wise showed He Himself.
[time=1415] There were together Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and the annual of Kaina in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of His disciples.
[time=1425] Simon Peter saith unto them I go of fishing.
[time=1427] They say unto Him we also go with thee.
[time=1431] They went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing.
[time=1435] And when the morning was come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
[time=1441] Then Jesus saith unto them children, have ye any meat?
[time=1446] And they answered Him, no shall we pray.
[time=1450] Lord this beginning of this chapter, these few words from this incident in the life of
[time=1457] our Lord and His learners, afford to us an excellent opportunity to evaluate our own
[time=1463] lives and to determine where we stand in our relationship to the Lord as far as our service is rendered.
[time=1470] We would ask that you would open our hearts to the truth of God today.
[time=1474] I thank you Father that before the word is ministered from a heart it must first go through a heart.
[time=1480] And I am grateful for what you have done in my own life as you have exposed me again to the divine searchlight of thy truth.
[time=1488] And I pray that as we share the insights from this portion of thy word that you will open up the hearts of everyone who listens and hears and shares this moment and make it a time of meaningful encouragement in their lives we pray in Jesus name and for His sake.
[time=1503] [AMEN] The most difficult lesson the disciples ever learned was the lesson of their powerlessness without Jesus Christ, throughout His ministry our Lord labored intensely to try to teach
[time=1518] the disciples that with Him they could do all things and without Him they could do nothing.
[time=1524] All of the incidents of faith that are recorded in the scriptures in the gospel narratives are attempts on the part of our Lord to instruct His disciples that unless they were willing to totally depend upon Him they were not able to cope with the avenues of life which they
[time=1540] were required to walk down.
[time=1543] I am thinking of some of the illustrations that He used to teach them this lesson.
[time=1546] You remember the night when He met them walking on the water in the midst of a storm and the scripture says that they were a frightened, that they did not know that it was the Lord they were very much afraid and there is an addendum to that story recorded in the book of Mark or in the book of Luke chapter 6 and verse 52 and it says this, "They considered
[time=1567] not the miracle of the loaves and their hearts were hardened." Luke chapter 6 follows the account of our Lord's multiplication of the loaves to the feeding of the five thousand and the scripture says that even though they were present during that miracle and saw the unbelievable power and ability of their Lord and Master that when
[time=1587] they were confronted with a personal crisis they could not depend upon that Lord to meet their need.
[time=1593] The scripture says they forgot what they had already been taught and their hearts were hardened.
[time=1599] On and on through the gospel narrative we see illustration after illustration of our Lord trying to teach His disciples that they could not do His work unless they were willing to do it in His way and with His power and on and on the disciples went trying to do it their own way.
[time=1616] It is interesting to me that the last word that our Lord illustrates with a miracle is
[time=1623] the word concerning this kind of service.
[time=1626] It is recorded here in the twenty first chapter of this great book the gospel of John.
[time=1633] It is an interesting chapter for a number of reasons.
[time=1635] First of all it seems to be an addition to the gospel.
[time=1639] If you read through the last part of the twentieth chapter it seems as if John has concluded his writing.
[time=1644] It gives the purpose for the book.
[time=1646] These things have been written he says and you seem to be coming to the end of the book and then you turn the page to discover that chapter twenty is not the end but chapter twenty one has been added.
[time=1657] Some have said it was added by someone else at a later date that it was an addendum to the book not so.
[time=1663] Whenever the book was circulated it was always circulated with twenty one chapters.
[time=1667] John himself added this and he recorded here one of the most interesting events in the life of our Savior.
[time=1674] It is an interesting event because it is very similar to a miracle that our Lord did when
[time=1680] he established these very same disciples in the ministry.
[time=1684] It is very similar to the miracle recorded in the fifth chapter of the book of Luke.
[time=1688] It is interesting because of its similarity to that account but it is interesting also because of its dissimilarity to that account.
[time=1697] It is a very important chapter for us to study because it is the only miracle that our Lord
[time=1703] did that is recorded for us in the Scripture after his resurrection.
[time=1708] It was a miracle that he did to illustrate a truth to his disciples that he hoped they would not soon forget as they awaited the day of Pentecost and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1719] Now the chapter itself can be easily divided into five sections and during these next five weeks we are going to take the five elements of chapter twenty one and deal with each of them individually.
[time=1730] The first five verses we may title the futility of service without Christ and as we move on
[time=1737] from that fifth verse beginning at verse six and going through to the eleventh verse we may title that the fruitfulness of serving with Christ and then beginning verses twelve through fourteen we have a lesson on fellowship and verses fifteen through seventeen there is
[time=1753] a lesson on faithfulness in serving the Lord and finally there is a beautiful presentation
[time=1759] of the truth that when we become Christ special servants we are no longer servants we become his friends and the lesson is on friendship.
[time=1768] Today we deal with the first five verses the futility of serving apart from Christ and
[time=1775] I would like to develop it as I may as if it were a lesson in progress as if it were a school room situation that Christ was using to teach this lesson to his disciples and in
[time=1786] doing that let us look first of all at the introduction to the lesson and we begin reading at verse one that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ showed himself again unto the disciples
[time=1798] at the sea of Tiberius.
[time=1800] The first part of the introduction with which we deal today is our Lord's self-disclosure.
[time=1805] The scripture says he showed himself to the disciples and after this manner showed he himself
[time=1812] unto them.
[time=1813] Now if you had time today to turn back to the twentieth chapter of the book of Matthew and read verses seven and ten you would discover that our Lord had instructed his disciples
[time=1823] to leave Jerusalem after his resurrection and go to Galilee and to wait there until he would
[time=1829] come and show himself unto them.
[time=1831] Once the disciples obediently did the scripture records that they moved out from the city of Jerusalem to that beautiful city of Galilee and there they waited for further instructions from the Lord.
[time=1842] I am interested in this phrase he showed himself unto them.
[time=1847] It was not a casual experience in the life of our Lord or in the experience of the disciples that we are about to discover.
[time=1854] It was not something that happened by accident it was the purposeful and meaningful self-disclosure
[time=1860] of the Savior to those disciples who had gathered there.
[time=1864] That word "disclosure" or "manifest" is a word which means that he purposefully revealed himself to them.
[time=1871] He uncovered himself, he made himself manifest to them in these events which are to transpire.
[time=1877] It was our Lord's desire to come to the very level on which the disciples lived, to meet them as they were fishing in that occupation which had been theirs before they were called to service, and someone has said we might entitle these verses which we are going to study the revelation of Christ at the fishing net and it would well be titled.
[time=1897] For it was the desire of our Lord to come to the avenue of work and enterprise and involvement
[time=1903] of the disciples and to meet them in the warp and woof of their life and to reveal himself to them in such a way that they would know that he was sufficient to meet their every need even in their daily life experiences.
[time=1917] Is that not like our Lord?
[time=1920] Does he not wish to come to us in the same way?
[time=1923] Where we work and where we serve to take from us the idea that the menial tasks of the day are mundane?
[time=1929] Is he not trying to break through the routine of our daily exercise and come to us with a revelation of himself and to share with us as he did with the disciples that he is sufficient to meet our need if we will meet the requirements that he has set down before us in his word.
[time=1946] The self-disclosure of our Savior he revealed himself to the disciples.
[time=1950] I want you to notice briefly the students who were present in the classroom that day.
[time=1955] The Scripture says there were seven disciples there.
[time=1959] Not all of the disciples were present.
[time=1962] Simon Peter was there.
[time=1964] James and John the sons of Zebedee were there, doubting Thomas whose life had been so drastically
[time=1971] changed as recorded in the 20th chapter of the book of John.
[time=1974] He was there.
[time=1975] The Scripture says that Nathaniel was there.
[time=1977] I find that interesting.
[time=1979] Nathaniel was the first disciple to declare himself forthrightly to the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1985] as recorded in the first chapter of the book of John where we have his words, "Thou art indeed the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel," and Nathaniel said that.
[time=1995] And then the Scripture says there were two other disciples there and it doesn't name them.
[time=2000] We don't know who they were.
[time=2001] We can guess but it will do us no good.
[time=2003] They have been left anonymous as if to include all of us in that category as students in the classroom.
[time=2010] These students who were gathered by the Sea of Tiberius had gathered at a place that was very familiar to them.
[time=2016] The Savior's self-disclosure and the students in the classroom all take place at a special
[time=2022] setting at a place called the Sea of Tiberius.
[time=2026] A few months ago, some of us from this fellowship and others who gathered had the privilege of traveling to Israel and we visited the Sea of Galilee.
[time=2036] And we understood perhaps in depth for the first time why it is sometimes called the Sea of Tiberius, for located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee is a large city which
[time=2046] still flourishes today mostly through tourism, the City of Tiberius.
[time=2051] And upon a night in the past, my wife and I stayed together in a luxurious hotel overlooking the Sea of Galilee in the City of Tiberius.
[time=2059] It was to that city that these disciples had regathered.
[time=2063] And as they sat there together on the shores of the Sea of Tiberius, they talked together I'm sure of the events that had transpired over the past few days.
[time=2073] The past few days for the disciples had been very unnerving experiences.
[time=2079] They had been in Jerusalem during the time when our Lord had been crucified.
[time=2084] They had received in those past three days more teaching from the Lord Jesus Christ than any human being could possibly assimilate in such a short time.
[time=2092] They had all of the hopes that had been treasured in their hearts for the establishment of an outward kingdom, all of them had been dashed when their Savior and Lord hung upon the cross.
[time=2104] One of their own number, a man by the name of Judas, had betrayed the Savior to the chief priests.
[time=2109] They had watched as the Lord that they loved and one that they thought would be coronated as their king had been taken to the cross and crucified.
[time=2117] They had seen all of that.
[time=2118] They had been a part of it and they had forsaken him in the hour of his trial and run back not to stand with him in that moment.
[time=2125] In two or three hours, these disciples gathered by the Sea of Tiberius had been reduced from the position of disciples of an honored and venerated teacher to that of hunted partisans
[time=2137] of a discredited and now crucified imposter.
[time=2145] No wonder they sat by the Sea of Tiberius and talked with one another.
[time=2149] They had had a brief revelation of the resurrected Christ and he had told them to go to the Sea of Galilee and there to wait and he would give them further instructions and they waited and they sat and they talked and they remembered and they thought together and that is the setting
[time=2168] and that is the introduction to the lesson.
[time=2171] But now we see the illustration or the incident.
[time=2174] They had returned to Galilee to await but now we see what happens when action takes place
[time=2183] where it shouldn't have taken place.
[time=2186] The Scripture records very tersely for us that Simon Peter saith unto them, "I go fishing"
[time=2194] and the words read in that manner almost express the emotion of this man for after we look
[time=2201] at the introduction of the lesson we must now look at the impetuous and impulsive action
[time=2207] of this man Peter.
[time=2209] Now they had returned to Galilee where they were to await further instruction from the Lord.
[time=2214] But Peter was not man who was prone to wait.
[time=2217] He was an impetuous man.
[time=2218] He was a man who was impulsive and a little bit of inactivity for Peter seemed like a long time of inactivity and I can just see him sitting around there with the other disciples and all of a sudden he jumps to his feet and he says, "I don't know about you guys but I'm going fishing." Peter was full of impetuosity.
[time=2238] He was an impulsive man.
[time=2239] You remember the time when he stood in the garden with the Savior and they were going to arrest the Savior and Peter says, "I'll take care of that Lord" and he whipped out his sword and chopped off Malchas ear and the Lord had to work a miracle to put the man back together.
[time=2250] You remember that?
[time=2251] You remember when they were out in the sea that night and the Lord came to him walking on the water and Peter said, "Hey, that looks like a neat thing to do.
[time=2258] Lord, I want to come" and he jumped out of the boat.
[time=2261] All of the other disciples stand there watching Peter wondering what would become of this fool who impetuously goes about his life.
[time=2269] During this very record that we have in the 21st chapter of the book of John we see that when finally the Lord is recognized on the shore during this experience, who was it that jumped out of the boat and swam to shore to meet the Lord?
[time=2280] It was Peter.
[time=2282] Someone has said that John the beloved apostle was the watcher.
[time=2285] Peter was the doer and he oftentimes didn't check to get his orders.
[time=2289] If he thought he wanted to do something he impulsively did it.
[time=2292] He was the kind of man who always got himself in trouble because he acted first and he thought
[time=2298] later and you laugh and you smile and I see your chuckles because so many of us are like that, are we not?
[time=2305] I think Peter is the most loved of all the disciples not because he was the best of the lot but because we are so much alike and I want to share with you tonight and today that
[time=2316] Peter's impulsive action got him into trouble.
[time=2321] The immediate response first of all of his followers was that they would go with him.
[time=2327] Isn't it interesting?
[time=2328] That I go fishing and all of the others who were gathered at that meeting said Peter we're going with you.
[time=2334] It is a reminder to me that one of the awesome things about being a Christian and especially
[time=2340] about being a Christian leader is the realization that you influence someone every time you
[time=2347] do anything.
[time=2349] Peter said I go fishing and six good men jumped up to go with him.
[time=2354] Peter did his thing and others followed.
[time=2357] And to be sure the only apparent result of that action was the fact that seven men toiled throughout the night and they caught nothing.
[time=2365] It was a discouraging night, a fruitless night.
[time=2368] But men and women is this not a vignette of hundreds of months and years of activity that
[time=2375] are spent by many of God's children because they are so willing to follow the whim of
[time=2381] a human rather than the will of the Holy Spirit and immediately they respond to do whatever
[time=2387] someone says because they are not waiting to check what God might say.
[time=2396] The impetuous and impulsive activity of Peter was followed by the immediate response of
[time=2402] his followers.
[time=2403] Notice the text says immediately without time to pray, without time to check it out, without time to discuss it immediately they got in the boat and out to fish they went.
[time=2416] This activity of the leader and of those who followed resulted in a night of ineffective
[time=2422] service.
[time=2424] The scripture says that that night they caught nothing.
[time=2430] Now they toiled and they sweat and they rode hard and they cast the nets into the sea.
[time=2437] They were experienced fishermen who had fished many hundreds of hours in these same waters.
[time=2441] They knew the territory and where the good spots were and they worked all night but the scripture says they caught nothing.
[time=2448] Had you stood on the shore to watch that fishing expedition and someone would have said to you what are those men doing you would have obviously said why they are fishing.
[time=2459] But if I understand this correctly fishing is not fishing where there are no fish.
[time=2464] And fruit bearing is not fruit bearing where there is no fruit.
[time=2468] And even though they toiled and they worked and they agonized and they sweat and they strain and they did all of the outward activity of fishing those men were not fishing.
[time=2479] The scripture says they caught nothing.
[time=2485] And the words of Christ ring out to us from the 15th chapter of the book of John in his great lesson on fruit bearing in the 5th verse he said without me ye can do what nothing.
[time=2497] Someone has said that nothing is a zero with the rims rubbed out that's what nothing is.
[time=2504] That night they caught nothing.
[time=2508] And certainly they must have responded with words they used in that earlier miracle recorded in Luke chapter 5 Lord we have toiled all night and we have caught nothing.
[time=2519] I want to say to you that there are many throughout this land and many perhaps in the ministry of this church who go through the agony and the toil of serving and have nothing to show for their outward activity because they have responded in the impulsive self will and direction
[time=2536] of their own desires instead of the expressed will of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=2543] I want you to notice fourthly in this incident not only the impulsive nature of Peter and
[time=2549] the immediate response of his followers and the ineffective night of service but what you notice the insightful question of the Lord.
[time=2558] The Lord had a way of always asking questions in such a way to embarrass those who didn't have the right answers and the scripture says verse 5 Jesus saith unto them children have
[time=2572] you any meat.
[time=2574] I don't know much about fishing and I'm not a fisherman but I do know this folks that one of the most dangerous questions to ask a fisherman if he doesn't have them dangling over his shoulder is the question did you catch anything for if he didn't you have one of
[time=2590] two things that will happen to you first of all you will have a dejected and very unhappy
[time=2596] man trying to tell you know or you will have to listen to a long story about the big one that got away.
[time=2603] Jesus said and he didn't use the word children which is the word for endearment he said really lads he stood at the shore and he said lads do you have any meat.
[time=2613] Now the Lord didn't need that question for information.
[time=2621] He wasn't trying to find out if they had any fish he knew what was in man he knew they hadn't caught anything the scripture said he'd been standing there.
[time=2629] He asked that question because he wanted the disciples themselves to say that they had
[time=2636] nothing in order that he himself might tell them what to do.
[time=2642] One has written that before God can ever furnish us with the abundance of supply we must first
[time=2648] be made aware of our own emptiness.
[time=2652] The Lord said lads have you any fish and the scripture is written in such a way that the beginning of that statement has the Greek little word may and it is a way of asking a question that automatically expects a negative answer and we could phrase it this way lads
[time=2667] you don't have any fish do you.
[time=2669] Jesus knew that but the disciples had to say no we don't.
[time=2674] I want to share with you a little bit later in this message that one of the most important things for us to recognize as we get ourselves involved in our own self directed activity is the willingness on our part to evaluate our own lives and to say you're right Lord when you said without you I can do nothing you spoke the gospel truth that is absolutely
[time=2694] inspired scripture and it's true in my life.
[time=2697] Now often we as modern day fishermen try to make excuses because we don't have any fruit to show in our lives but Jesus pointed his finger at the heart of those disciples and at their futility and he said you don't have anything to show for your activity and they
[time=2712] said master you're right we don't we're empty handed without you we can't do nothing without
[time=2720] you Lord we're we're fruitless.
[time=2724] I like what Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 3 verse 5 he wrote not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[time=2732] to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God.
[time=2739] That's what God wants to teach us Dr. Hendricks used to tell us in class about a woman who
[time=2745] was in his church who used to pray oh Lord that I might be nothing and one day he went
[time=2752] to her and he said lady will you take that by faith you are nothing that's what the scripture says about you.
[time=2759] God wants to teach that to us that without him we have no sufficiency and we can go through the outward actions and do all of the right things and be involved in the outward impression of serving him but if Christ isn't in it we will have nothing to show in lasting fruit
[time=2775] for our labor and that's the incident that our Lord used to teach the lesson.
[time=2785] Now in conclusion I want to share with you two or three impressions that this is made upon my own heart and upon my own life.
[time=2794] First of all I couldn't help but notice that throughout this entire experience as the disciples
[time=2800] worked all night and they involved themselves in the activity.
[time=2805] My first impression from this was that Christ was watching their struggle.
[time=2810] The Bible says Jesus stood on the shore and as I went back through the various miracles
[time=2818] that our Lord used to try to teach his disciples faith I have discovered something exciting to me and that is that the Lord Jesus Christ even when we're operating in self motivation
[time=2829] he watches our struggle.
[time=2830] He knows what's going on.
[time=2832] There's a very beautiful account of this in the sixth chapter of the book of Mark let me read to you just a couple of verses found there.
[time=2839] You know that the disciples were sent away in the scripture says and when the disciples were sent away he departed the Lord departed into a mountain to pray and when evening was
[time=2849] come the boat was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and Christ saw them
[time=2857] toiling and rowing and about the fourth watch of the night he come with unto them.
[time=2863] Listen he saw them toiling and rowing you're involved in your activity going here and there
[time=2869] got a schedule that no one in this world could ever keep and someone says to you what are you doing I'm fishing I'm serving the Lord and in your heart there's something missing because you're working in your own will instead of the Lord's will.
[time=2882] Let me tell you something friend the Lord's watching that he's watching.
[time=2886] There is something both comforting and convicting about that truth.
[time=2892] Comforting because I know that my Lord hasn't forgotten about me and he hasn't forgotten about you even when you get involved in the frenzied activity of your own life apart from him.
[time=2903] He knows it he watches it he sees it but convicting because we recognize immediately that our fruitless
[time=2910] efforts are being wrought out in the all watching eye of the Savior he's watching.
[time=2919] I want you to notice secondly as we gain impressions from this lesson that he was waiting.
[time=2926] He was waiting what was he waiting for?
[time=2929] Our Lord always waits until we have rode and we have no energy left to row and we have toiled
[time=2935] and we have no energy left to toil and we have fished and we have nothing left with with which to fish and we've worked and we've struggled and we come to the very end of ourselves and we say and it's useless it's it's no use we've had a fruitless night Lord we've caught
[time=2951] nothing and the Lord's there waiting just waiting for us to say Lord you're right what
[time=2962] you said at the beginning is true without you I can do nothing isn't it interesting that
[time=2969] in the scripture I read for you just a few moments ago that the word of God says that the Lord stood on the shore watching them rowing and toiling and about the fourth watch
[time=2979] of the night he walketh to them upon the water just at the time when they were in the midst
[time=2985] of total despair he came to them I've always enjoyed the story of our Lord sleeping in
[time=2992] the boat as the disciples were on the tempestuous sea I remember telling that to one of my children some years ago I don't remember which one it was now but they came up with a great insight they said you know I bet that the Lord really wasn't asleep in the back
[time=3007] of the boat I bet he was peaking I don't know if that's true or not but I have to believe
[time=3013] that perhaps it was because it's certainly consistent with what our Lord did in the rest of the miracles he was watching the toil in the struggle and all of the agony of these disciples going here and there trying to do it all in their own strength and he waited
[time=3028] for the moment of their willingness to admit that without him they could do nothing and
[time=3036] then he came to them the third impression I have from this record is this not only is our Lord watching not only is he waiting but he is willing when we come to the end of ourselves
[time=3049] when we come to the despair that often fills us when we have tried to do it our way apart from his way and we're willing to agree with him and with his word and say Lord you're right I won't do it my way anymore I can't do it in my strength then the Lord is willing to say cast your net on the other side of the boat listen if you'll do it my way I promise
[time=3071] you it'll be affected if you do it my way I promise you they'll be fruit if you listen to my instructions I'm willing to give instructions to a willing here nothing so gladdens the
[time=3082] heart of the Savior as to have his servants come to him with an open and willing heart and say Lord what would you have me to do without me you can do nothing I'm certain that this
[time=3098] is what Theodore Minnow meant when he wrote to the words of a hymn which take us probably
[time=3104] through the struggles in our own lives and successive stanzas I don't know you or what
[time=3110] you might be struggling with in your own spiritual personal life right now but let me say something to you all of us in this auditor and whoever hears my voice are probably in one of the four stages of coming to the realization of our helplessness without Christ Theodore
[time=3126] Minnow wrote these words and each of the stanzas is a growing process in his own life as he
[time=3133] came to grips with this great truth of his total dependence upon the Lord he wrote all
[time=3139] the bitter shame and sorrow that in a time could ever be when I let the Savior's pity
[time=3147] plead in vain and I proudly answered all of self none of the yet he found me I beheld him
[time=3159] bleeding on the cursed tree heard him pray forgive them father and my wistful heart said
[time=3166] faintly some of self and some of the day by day his tender mercy healing helping full
[time=3177] and free sweet and strong and oh so patient brought me lower till I whispered less of
[time=3185] self and more of the higher than the highest heavens deeper than the deepest see Lord I
[time=3195] love at last hath conquered grant me now my soul's petition none of self and all of
[time=3203] thee the lesson our Lord tried to teach his disciples consistently over and over again
[time=3210] through the experiences that he allowed them to experience and the lesson that he bangs upon us so consistently to teach us over and over again is the lesson of this last stanza
[time=3221] none of self and all of the and when the Lord Jesus Christ can look down upon his children
[time=3228] when he can look at you and he can look at me and he can discover that within us there is none of self and there is only a willingness and a desire to be a channel used of God through
[time=3240] which he can do his work then the nets will be full and the fruit will be plenteous and
[time=3248] the joy of fellowship will be great and the wonderful work of our blessed lord and savior
[time=3254] can go forward unabated because we have been willing to learn that great and important
[time=3261] lesson of service that futility belongs to those who serve in their own will but fruitlessness
[time=3269] is the lot of those who give themselves totally to Jesus Christ shall we pray. Lord it is our
[time=3281] prayer in these closing moments that each of us would renew our commitment to be channels through whom the spirit of God might work that it might be said of us that we have given
[time=3293] all to thee and that there is none of self clouding and cluttering the lives of those
[time=3300] who would serve thee. We ask that each of you who share this moment with us if you have
[time=3308] not already trusted Christ as your savior and given him your life that right now this very moment you would bow in prayer with your heart open to the lord and receive Jesus Christ
[time=3320] as your savior you cannot begin the joy of service until first he belongs to you and
[time=3326] so I ask you to simply pray and invite him into your life. You have been sharing the Bible our with pastor David Jeremiah if as a result of this program you have made a decision
