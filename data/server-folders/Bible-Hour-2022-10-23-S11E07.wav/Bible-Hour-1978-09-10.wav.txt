[time=28] [ Singing ]
[time=43] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=45] >> Bye, that is tremendous singing, and we did it better every time we sang it.
[time=52] [AMEN] >> I don't know a Christian that I've ever met who was in fellowship with the Lord that did not want to know God's blessing upon His life.
[time=63] If we know God, we have a deep burning desire to please Him and to be useful in His service.
[time=71] There are many who communicate the truths of fruitfulness from human standards and confuse the issue, but God communicates it from His truth, the Bible, and when we learn how to serve God in the sense of fruitfulness that the Bible teaches, we not only are successful according to God's standards, but we have joy in serving Him.
[time=95] In a few moments, we're going to open our Bibles to the 21st chapter of the Book of John, and they're discussed together, God's plan for fruitful living in the Christian experience, and I trust that He will prepare your hearts in the meantime to receive the word that He would bring to you from the message of the morning as you wait expectantly for it.
[time=116] First of all, however, we have some music that will be an encouragement to your heart.
[time=121] We are hosting this week the Missionary Enrichment Conference of the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=127] We have over 200 missionaries visiting with us in our service today, and throughout the service you will sense a spirit of excitement that all of us feel as we wait for God to minister to our hearts during these moments.

[time=950] I have always been a sports enthusiast, Most of you know, We go through a timeline as we grow older From participation to spectatorship, I suppose in that continuum, I am somewhere over the hump.
[time=964] Someone wrote recently that you know when it's over, Like Joe DiMaggio knew when it was over for him, He said one day he was in the outfield, And someone hit him a ground ball, And he heard his mind say, Reach over and pick it up, But his body said who, me?
[time=980] All of us come to that point in our life on occasion, But I still enjoy the involvement of athletics, And when I knew that our special guest today would be Mr. Pat Williams, the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, My heart skipped a little beat because there were so many things I wanted to ask him, I've asked him a few already, I still have a few yet I want to talk to him about, But he's been a blessing to us already in his ministry, And it's such a thrill to know that there are men of God In the various marketplaces of our world Bearing a testimony for Jesus Christ, And one of the most difficult places to stand tall for the Lord Jesus Christ, He is doing it with great impact, And we're so thankful that he could be here today, He's going to come now and give us a testimony, telling us what God has done in his life.
[time=1031] Pat Williams is the youngest general manager in professional sports.
[time=1035] He is the one, if you follow the newspapers, Who was responsible for the finality of details That involve the George McGinnis trade, And he has been responsible in many of the upper level negotiations That have put together one of the exciting basketball teams That plays in our country, the United States.
[time=1054] Pat Williams, it's good to have you here.
[time=1056] Come and share what God has meant to you in your own personal life.
[time=1059] Thank you very much, Pastor. I would just share very briefly That some exciting things are happening spiritually In athletics in our country today, right at this very moment.
[time=1068] All 28 of the professional football teams in America Are meeting and having a chapel service Within an hour or two all across America, All 26 of the big league baseball teams Will have a Christ-centered message Taking place right in the locker room Before their ball games this afternoon.
[time=1085] Keep this high on your prayer list.
[time=1087] Some tremendous things are happening.
[time=1089] Young athletes are being faced daily With the claims of Christ on their lives And many are responding in a positive way And are having a dynamic, powerful witness With many, many young people across America Some good things are happening in sports these days And I think these athletes who have a platform of witness Second to none in America Can use your prayer support and your backing and your thoughts As you go through each day.
[time=1113] On June 1st of 1962 I graduated from college And embarked a career on a pun a career In professional athletics The first seven years were spent in professional baseball And almost the last ten have been spent In the National Basketball Association Operating teams in Chicago, Atlanta And Philadelphia Every day that I've gotten out of bed In my adult life and my feet have hit the floor I've really had just one subject on my mind One thing has crossed my mind every day And that is this What can I do today To help the team that I'm working for win more games Because you see the name of the game in professional athletics Is built upon one word And that word is winning Unfortunately nobody is particularly concerned With how much character we build At the end of our seasons they don't have Parties to hand out letter sweaters All anybody asks from the writers to the ownership To the fans is one question Did your team win or lose?
[time=1175] And if you lose too much Unfortunately in our business They have a strange habit They get rid of you And they bring in somebody else to take your place So my whole adult life has been built upon this word of winning As a youngster growing up My definition of winning was very simple Set a goal for yourself Work as hard as you possibly can And with some good breaks along the line You will be successful And if you're successful And have the things of this world A nice automobile A wardrobe full of nice clothes Plenty to eat And a good looking date on your arm Then you're a winner And if you win some ball games along the line You're an extra special winner And that was my game plan From the time I was 7 years old When my dad took me to my first big league baseball game And from that point until I was 24 years old I had one overwhelming desire And that was to get to the major leagues as a ball player I didn't make it But the Phillies gave me an opportunity To get started in the administrative end of sports And I set goals for myself there Worked hard, achieved them And in the eyes of the world I was a successful young man But inwardly I knew that there was an emptiness There was a void that success was just not filling And it was very, very frustrating for me Because I had tried everything And nothing was filling that void Until one day, about 11 years ago Primarily through the witness of an ex-big league ball player Named Bobby Mountmus Who came to our team in Spartanburg, South Carolina And for six weeks, he lived in front of me, the Christian life He never said a word But his life was so different That it really demanded an explanation I was also challenged that spring By the powerful verbal testimony of Paul Anderson The strongest man in the world A man who at one point in his weightlifting career Hoisted over 6,000 pounds on his back in a backlift But Paul told me that that was not the most important thing in his life He said the most important thing in my life is being a Christian And he challenged me when he said If I can't get through one minute of the day Without Jesus Christ in my life He said, "How about you?" Well, I had never been talked to in that manner But I realized that Paul had something in his life that was missing in mind I began reading and studying And I became aware of the awesome reality That there was a God who created me and loved me And had a plan and purpose for my life I recognized that I was cut off from God I was unaware of the plan and purpose that he had for my life Because of one factor in my life And that was the factor of sin It's an ugly word, a word that we don't like to talk about But God calls it as it is And even though I had never murdered anybody Rob, any banks shot up with drugs or taken a drink of alcohol The fact that I was going my own independent way Saying to God, "God, you go your way and leave me alone" That made me as sinful as any murderer locked up in jail in America today But the exciting good news that became evident to me as I read and studied my Bible Was the fact that God came to this earth In the form of a human being less than 2,000 years ago And for 33 years in the person of Jesus Christ God lived the most perfect holy life that this world has ever known But he came primarily not to live He came primarily to die on a rough Roman cross For me and for you And if you and I had been the only people that ever walked the face of this earth Christ would have still taken our place Suffered in our place and died instead of us An awesome fact and exciting reality One that I don't understand It's one that I can't really defend It's just a way that I had to believe I accepted all of that with my mind But God requires us to go one step further as I found out And that's to make not only a mental decision but a heart decision And respond to a Christ who is knocking on the door of every life in this world today I responded by inviting him into my life I really as I look back now had three options I could accept him, I could reject him Or I could put it off, I could do nothing about it at the moment But that would not have taken into account the X factor of death Which none of us can predict, none of us knows And so I responded in a positive way I invited Christ into my life a little over ten years ago And he came into my life in such a real dramatic revolutionary way That he changed me totally from the inside out And I can stand before you this morning And tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt That Jesus Christ is the real thing He's not a phony, he's not a fraud He came into my life, changed me totally Gave me a whole new start, a whole new set of directions A whole new set of priorities And my challenge to you this morning If you're looking for complete total and absolute pardon From every sin that you've ever committed in your life I recommend to you Jesus Christ If you're looking for total peace The peace that passeth all understanding That this world cannot provide The trips, martinis and needles cannot provide I recommend Jesus Christ If you're looking for purpose in your life Trying to figure out where you came from Why you're here, where you're headed And your ultimate destination I recommend Jesus Christ And if you're looking for power in your life Power to live up on top of your daily circumstances Power that comes from staying in touch With a holy loving God through prayer And studying and reading his word His love letter to you the Bible I recommend Christ And if you're looking for a supernatural love To come inside of your heart Unconditional love Love not only for God but love and acceptance of yourself And love for your fellow man I recommend Jesus Christ And I pray that if you're here today Or watching my television And you've never made that decision It's the most important one that you'll ever make And I pray that God will give you the strength And the courage to make that decision That is not in question in his life, is it?
[time=1523] Amen His wife has also ministered to us during these days Jill is a former Miss Illinois A very high up in the Miss America pageant And God is using her as she walks beside her husband In the very place of responsibility In the strategic ministry that is his To encourage hearts with her testimony and her music Before the message this morning She's going to sing for us

[time=1805] Thank you, Jill, for your ministry to us in music And now our Bibles are open To the 21st chapter of the book of John John chapter 21 Where we begin to discuss the second section In this great chapter from the Word of God John chapter 21 And I'm reading from The 21st chapter of John Beginning at the 6th verse Where we read these words And Jesus said unto them Cast the net on the right side Of the boat and ye shall find They cast therefore And now they were not able to draw it For the multitude of fish Therefore that disciple Whom Jesus loved said unto Peter It is the Lord Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord He gird his fishers coat unto him For he was naked And he did cast himself into the sea And the other disciples came And a little boat for they were not far from land But as it were 200 cubits Dragging the net with fish And soon then as they were come to land They saw fire of coals there And fish laid on it in bread And Jesus said unto them Bring of the fish which ye have now caught Simon Peter went up and drew the net To land full of great fish And 150 and 3 And although there were so many Yet was not the net broken I do not know anyone that I have ever met Who does not want to be A successful Christian One of the difficulties that we face As Christians in our society Is the realization that success Is a much muddled term We are often apt to read into it That which the secularists are writing about And miss the point completely That the word of God has for us And which we must understand If we are to be successful Fruitful Christians for the Lord Some years ago Will Durant the recognized Great historian Wrote these words Which are appropriate for the Beginning of this message today Dr. Durant made this observation He said the greatest question Of our time is not communism Versus individualism It is not Europe versus America Nor the East versus the West It is whether man can learn How to live without God Now our normal understanding of that statement Would be to apply it to those Who reject God and keep him out of their lives entirely The unfortunate and tragic Thing about that statement Is that it is far too appropriate To many Christians today Who are trying to learn how to live Without their God And have allowed their lives to degenerate Into what may be properly termed Practical atheism Though giving head knowledge To the Lord and often lip service To his presence in their life They live their Christianity As if he did not exist I suppose we ought not to take Comfort in it though it is possible For us to do it on occasion As I mentioned to those of you who were here Last week as we began this series of messages Perhaps the greatest And most difficult lesson which our Lord ever taught his disciples Was the lesson of their total dependence Upon him. Through many experiences That are recorded in the Gospels We have his efforts to demonstrate To them that without him They could do nothing It is certainly demonstrated here in this chapter This chapter gives to us God's design for fruitfulness In our living And the beauty of this chapter Is the beauty of all of God's word That it is appropriate to us Wherever we may be In whatever avenue of service We may be found this morning It is appropriate to the missionary Who is a veteran It is appropriate to that young Christian Who just accepted Christ last week And is seeking to get started On the right foot It is appropriate to those in professional service And those who are just lay people Living their life as does Pat Williams In the warp and woof of secular society These are the principles of fruitfulness That God would have for us If were to serve According to his word The first thing we notice in this text By way of review is this That fruitfulness is the realization of emptiness Without God In the experience that is recorded In the first few verses of John 21 We have the record of a fishing expedition That was instigated by the impulsive action of Peter He had come to Galilee To wait for further instruction From his master And while they gathered around the sea of Tiberius Which is the sea of Galilee Or as they refer to it in Israel The tenorith Peter said "I go fishing" His impulsive action Met with the immediate response Of the other six men who had gathered with him there Peter was accompanied On that expedition By Thomas the doubter James and John Nathaniel and two unnamed disciples The scripture says They put out into the sea and began to fish The impulsive action of Peter He instigated the immediate response of the disciples But alas it resulted in An ineffective night of service All the scripture records that they toiled all night And they caught nothing In the morning there was one watching From the shore who put to them An insightful question Jesus said "Lads, have you any meat?" Or to be more accurate in our translation "Lads, you don't have any meat, do you?" "You haven't caught anything, have you?" And that insightful question Promoted in the lives of those seven men The greatest lesson of fruitfulness That our Lord was to teach them After his resurrection Before he ascended back to his father Will you notice that the scripture Clearly teaches us Just by example But also by precept That we as Christians Are not able to be fruitful If we try to do it in our own strength The Bible says, as was read for us A few moments ago, that without him We can do nothing When our Lord asked the disciples Had they caught anything He knew ahead of time that they had not He was not asking for information For he knew what was in man But he was seeking to solicit From the disciples the admission Of that which he already knew to be true That they were powerless Without him He was seeking to get from them What he seeks to get from us A confession of our emptiness Without the fullness of Christ Someone has well written That before God can furnish us With the abundant supply We must be willing and aware Of our emptiness Or as someone else has written Before we take his strength We must be occupied with our weakness Those disciples illustrate for us A great truth No matter where we may serve No matter how great our position Or responsibility No matter what talents we may Possess humanly They are all of no use whatsoever To God unless we see them As our emptiness Which he wants to infill with his spirit The disciples learned The first lesson of fruitfulness That without him It is interesting to note in this text That through their self-willed And self-centered service The Savior was watching And as we looked last week We discovered that on many occasions When the disciples were toiling and rowing The Savior watched from a distance Involved as it were in their exploits Waiting for the right moment When they were willing to confess Their own emptiness And to put an end to their own Personal human endeavor And teach them what they needed to know May I by way of review For our people but on the bottom line For all who are hearing me In this series for the first time Help you to understand that the first Key to fruitfulness in our lives Is the realization of our emptiness Without God But notice secondly That if we're to be fruitful There must come a time in our lives When we are responsive In obedience to the Word of God Jesus Christ was standing on the shore A hundred yards away from the disciples Yet at his first word They were willing to obey Now I don't know how many of you know How unwilling most fishermen are To take advice Or how unwilling they might be To take advice from an unknown stranger But the Scripture is quite clear That when Jesus spoke They had yet to identify him They didn't know him Yet the Word of God says that To cast the net on the other side They immediately responded I do not know all that is involved In that phrase and in their response But it seems to me That it illustrates and Exemplifies for us the fact That at the Word of God There is inherent power And the recognition that That is a word different than other words And the disciples heard it immediately And they responded The power of the Word of God Is inherent in the Word of God I think it is time for those of us Who claim to be fishers of men That we're willing to recognize That even in the Great Commission The low is conditioned upon the go God has not promised to do for us What we will not accept By way of instruction for him And if we refuse to be obedient That is the bottom line of success He does not promise us success Go ye into all the world And low I am with you The low is conditioned upon the go The disciples could not reap any benefits If they were disobedient to the Lord And the Scripture says they obeyed It is an interesting thing to see this As a picture of us today The disciples on the sea Toiling Representing us in the world The Savior on the shore To which the disciples were ultimately destined Representing Jesus Christ In heaven awaiting us as we finish Our toil here And the Savior speaking to the disciples As they would serve him Notice they did not address him but he Them and he spoke to them From his place of security on the shore To direct them in their service For him as they attempted To be successful in their endeavor I am so excited to know That as I toil in the midst of the sea Trying to be faithful and fruitful For the Lord that there is a word from him That instructs me in my endeavor And if I am willing to be obedient to that word And responsive to it I can understand the meaning of the words That David wrote in Psalm 19 That in the keeping of his commandments There is great reward Two of the commands that are given here Are the words of Christ Both of them implicitly obeyed Now there is a good illustration In another account of a fishing expedition That I would just like to share with you That you might tuck it away in your own mind For further investigation later I have shared with you earlier That the account in John 21 Is very similar to the account In the fifth chapter of the book of Luke Where Jesus Christ inducted Four of his disciples Into the ministry On that night they had a fishing expedition And the Scripture says they toiled all night And they caught nothing And Christ told them to launch out into the deep And then he said Put your nets Plural down And ye shall find And the Scripture said Peter said Lord we have toiled all night We have caught nothing Nevertheless at thy word we will put Our net down And the Scripture records That they put their net singular Down into the water And as you read the story you discover That they had a problem in getting those And for the record says in Luke 5 That when they would draw the fish to the boat The net did break And the fish many of them were lost Is that not an illustration for us?
[time=2538] That when we are obedient We must be implicitly obedient Jesus said to the disciples Let down your net, John 21 They did and the record Is clear that they lost nothing Of that which they had caught Jesus had said earlier Let down your nets And they were almost obedient But not quite And the result was the same As if they had been totally Disobedient Fruitfulness in our lives Men and women is the result of obedience To the word of God In the 15th chapter of the book of John We are taught that as we abide in the Lord And His word abides in us And as we keep His commandments We bear fruit Ye more fruit Yes even much fruit In your fruitful In your service for the Lord Jesus Christ Then you need to understand that You have a word from God And that word is His instruction to you And that word is to be obeyed Implicitly There is no fruitfulness without obedience You may strive to do it in your own strength You may neglect what God has said And if you do You have no reason to complain When the result is not there Fruitfulness is not only The realization of the emptiness In our lives without God And the responsible beadience To the word of God But as we study further in the text We discover that fruitfulness Is the recognition of the power of God At work in our lives It is amusing to read the commentaries Written by liberal scholars As they try to explain How the fish that word on one side of the boat All of a sudden got on the other side of the boat One commentator I read this week One hundred yards away That all of the fish were in the school On the right side of the boat And so he just told them to do what he saw Well, I don't believe that's the answer Someone has said that the difference between fruitfulness And unfruitfulness was a small matter Of just three feet, the width of the boat Those fish got into the net Not because the Lord saw them there But because he drew them there Those fish responded to the instruction of our Savior Because as he spoke to the disciples He also spoke to the fish And when the net was cast And obedience to the Lord in the right place The sovereign God drew the fish into the net And there was a great catch I want to share with you today That though I believe with all of my heart That is men and women of the faith And as many of us servants of Christ We are responsible to go forth And share the good word of the gospel With all of the energy that is our disposal We are ultimately dependent upon the sovereign God Who draws the fish into the net And if in response to his word We will cast the net in the right place And we will abide in him We can be sure that he will bring to us That fruit which he would have us To receive And then isn't it interesting That when he does so We recognize immediately That it is him I've always been interested in the study of the disciples And especially the contrast Between the personalities of John and Peter John was the one who always was discerning Peter was the one who was always acting If we could have ever blended their two personalities We would have had one of the greatest Christians who ever lived Peter was always tending to act before thinking And I think on occasion that John may have been wise Had he been more involved in the activity John, you know, was the one who leaned Upon the breast of the Savior At the last supper John was the one you know who Was seated next to the Lord When the Lord revealed to him the identity of his betrayer It was to John that the Lord committed the care of his mother On the cross John was the one who first perceived That the Lord was resurrected And it's not hard to understand That in the midst of this experience John was the one who said It filled the net It is the Lord It was in the realization of fruitful service That John recognized something It happened that was uncommon to man And he was willing to give the Lord the credit Is it not possible that one of the reasons God cannot use us more than he does Is that we ask him to do for us What we cannot do for ourselves And when he does We act as if we had done it ourselves John knew that God was in this Because it was something so uncommon It could be explained in no other terms Than in the power of God May I say to you that if you would be fruitful You need to understand in your life That fruitfulness comes when God's power is activated And is working in your life And when that is true you will know it And when it is true and you know it You will be able to say with John It is the Lord who has done this And you need to say that Well that is the key to Continual fruitfulness in your life Fruitfulness is not only the result And realization of our emptiness Without the Lord It is not only the response of our Obedience to the Lord Fruitfulness is the recognition Of God's power at work in our lives John said It is the Lord Will you notice fourthly that Fruitfulness Is the result of the presence of Christ Available in your life Peter couldn't wait To see the Lord John said it is the Lord and Peter didn't even ask any questions The Scripture says He jumped into the water and he went To see the Savior He was accustomed to doing that The Lord walked to the boat on the water In the midst of the storm It was Peter who couldn't wait for him to get to the boat So he decided to meet him halfway Peter was the impetuous one But we can learn something from him The Scripture says that Peter left The fishes in the boat and he went to the Savior It is similar to the woman Of Samaria who left her water pots To fellowship with the Lord Do we not see in Peter's action?
[time=2908] That is important as duty is Duty takes second place To devotion Peter didn't stay to watch the fish He went to see the Savior He didn't stay to count What had happened The Lord was there And he went to fellowship with him What a blessed scene it is When the coals are on the fire The coals are around the fire And the fishes and the bread laid there It is reminiscent of another time In John 18 when Peter stood by The coals of a fire But at that time he stood to warm himself With the enemies of the Lord Something tremendous had happened And he gathered with his Savior On the shore For he recognized that the key to his life Was all summed up in the presence Of Jesus Christ And he fellowshiped with him there I want to say to all of us And to myself first of all And to all of you Wonderful friends in the family of God Servants of the Lord That is important as duty is And we shall be challenged to it this week It is a hard but necessary lesson That devotion is always A priority to duty For duty without devotion Becomes the perfunctory Involvement of an individual Without power and without Ministry But devotion That precedes duty Is always That which brings God's blessing Isn't it interesting that Peter went from the presence of his Savior To pull the net to shore I couldn't help but observe Though I'm not sure of all of the culture Involved in the fishing expedition That earlier in the chapter The Scripture says that the net was So full that they could not Collectively bring it together It was too much for them Peter in the meantime Evacuates the ship Comes to the shore And he spends some time with his Savior In fellowship And then we read that the Lord said Peter Bring of the fish which you have now caught And Peter went up and drew the net To land full of great fish It seems to me that Peter was able to do After being with the Lord What six men couldn't do Who hadn't yet been with him It seems to me that when we are In the presence of our Lord in fellowship And we are drawing upon the strength That is his through our devotional relationship To him that we go forth The feet of Jesus to do great And mighty exploits for him I was overwhelmed this week To read again the great words From the prophet Isaiah in the 40th chapter When he wrote, "Hast thou not known?" "Hast thou not heard?" That the Almighty God The Lord The Creator of the ends of the earth Fainteth not Neither is weary And then just a few verses later But they that wait upon the Lord Shall renew their strength They shall mount up with wings as eagles They shall run and not be weary They shall walk and not faint The reason that we wait upon the Lord Is because the Lord is the secret And source of strength He is the one who fainteth not Neither is weary And as we fellowship with him We draw upon his strength And we go from his feet to serve him In a wonderful and mighty way Oh how hard it is for us to learn that How often we try to do it According to the methods and the principles Of the successful world system Only to fall on our faces Because we haven't learned the lesson That devotion always is a priority over duty I speak to some missionaries now Who do a hundred jobs That you never were called to do Who function in the field in such a way That no human could be expected to do What you do And yet I want to urge upon you That this principle is true for you As it is for me That your duty is meaningless without devotion That you need to leave the fish And go to the feet of the Savior And there to draw strength from him I read recently of a missionary Who was so pressed By the natives who came to visit him Early in the morning to find help And who found his day so filled with activity That he got up at three o'clock in the morning And spent an hour with his Lord And he went back to sleep Waiting for the natives to knock at seven Because he had learned the lesson That devotion is a priority over duty Oh you'll learn it The hard way or the easy way Because that's the lesson God must teach us If we're to be fruitful Now this is a wonderful story And it has a great conclusion By way of conclusion Let me share it with you Lord Jesus Christ After the fish were caught Instructed them to bring the fish To him The Bible tells us in Psalm 126 and verse 6 That they that go forth Bearing precious seed Shall doubtless come again Bringing their sheaves with them I am certain that you have heard About as many messages as I have On the importance of the number Of fish that were caught And I'm not going to muddy the water Any further I don't think anybody knows why The fish were counted There is no symbolism That is in any way meaningful But I want to tell you what God told me As I was studying that Because I think it may be the most Meaningful thing we could say About that experience The Savior said bring the fish to me And we see that Peter drew the net And he brought the fish and they were counted But listen The Savior We are so anxious To total up the result of our fruitfulness But you know the real accounting Will never be made until we reach the shore Where the Savior is And the accounting is made in his presence If we could learn that lesson Wouldn't it do a lot To rid us of our petty jealousies And our misunderstandings Of who is doing what, where, and why If we could only understand That that person in the far, flung corners Of the world who serves Will one day have his fruitfulness Evaluated in the presence of the Savior As will this pastor and other pastors And world-renowned evangelists And there will be no partiality Or misunderstanding Or fraudulent comparison When he evaluates Oh, I tell you something It's exciting to know That God has given to us his word To teach us that we are empty Without him To remind us that his power Is available to us To give us the encouragement and instruction To go forth to serve him According to the principles that he has given us We are in the sea and he is on the shore But we do have a word from the Savior And that word Is the word that stands between Futility and fruitfulness Will you hear it this morning?
