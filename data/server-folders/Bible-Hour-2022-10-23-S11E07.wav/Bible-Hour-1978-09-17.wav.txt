[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=10] >> From the Convocation Center of the Life of Baptist Church in Indiana,
[time=16] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=20] [MUSIC]
[time=36] >> Several months ago, our newspaper carried the story of a father who was backing his car out of the driveway
[time=46] and that which creates fear in the heart of every one of us happened to him.
[time=53] Somehow, his child had gotten behind the car and he backed the car over the legs of his little boy.
[time=61] When he got out to see what had happened and realized what had taken place,
[time=67] without ever stopping to think, he reached down and grabbed hold of that which was not a compact
[time=74] and in superhuman strength physically lifted that car off of his son and with one of his feet scooted the little boy out from underneath the wheel.
[time=85] They figured out the strength that it took for him to accomplish that, and their analysis was that it was supernatural, that it was humanly impossible for him to have done that.
[time=96] And yet, because of his love for his boy, he was motivated to do what no human being
[time=103] could ever do according to natural motivation.
[time=108] That's just a very simple illustration that the greatest motivation in all of the world is the motivation of love.
[time=114] And when we truly come to grips with what it means to love, both to love Christ and to love one another,
[time=120] it becomes the dynamic in our service that enables us as Christians to do supernatural things.
[time=128] God, through his son Jesus Christ, taught that lesson to Peter in John 21,
[time=135] and we're studying it together in just a few moments.
[time=138] First of all, we have planned some great music, and that music is under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=144] He leads our choir now as they sing for us a beautiful song entitled "Come Thou Found of Every Blessing."
[time=159] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=217] [MUSIC] O, to wonder, Lord, I feel it [MUSIC] O, to be the Lord I know [MUSIC] My heart will take us to thee [MUSIC] See with all thy courts above [MUSIC] I am bound for the kingdom where you go to glory with me [MUSIC] Hallelujah, praise the Lord [MUSIC] Hallelujah, praise the Lord [MUSIC] Hallelujah, praise the Lord [MUSIC] There's a tremendous encouragement that comes to our heart through the ministry of music [MUSIC] And yet there's a strength that comes to our heart through the Word of God [MUSIC] I'd like to read for you this morning from Ephesians the fourth chapter [MUSIC] What the Apostle Paul wrote in the first six verses [MUSIC] I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord beseech you [MUSIC] That you walk worthy of the vocation to which you are called [MUSIC] With all loneliness and meekness [MUSIC] With long suffering, forbearing one another in love [MUSIC] Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace [MUSIC] There is one body and one spirit [MUSIC] Even as you are called in one hope of your calling [MUSIC] One Lord, one faith, one baptism [MUSIC] One God and Father of all [MUSIC] One God and Father of all [MUSIC] Who is above all and through all and in you all [MUSIC] The words of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter 1, chapter 4 verses 1 through 6 [MUSIC] All I had to offer him was brokenness and strife [MUSIC] But he made something beautiful of my life [MUSIC] If there ever were dreams that were lofty and noble [MUSIC] They were my dreams at the start [MUSIC] And the hopes for life's best when the hopes that I harbored [MUSIC] Down deep in my heart, but my dreams turned to ashes [MUSIC] My castles all crumbled, my fortune turned to loss [MUSIC] So I wrapped it all in the ranks of my life and laid it at the cross [MUSIC] Something beautiful, something good [MUSIC] Of my confusion he understood [MUSIC] All I had to offer him was brokenness and strife [MUSIC] But he made something beautiful of my life [MUSIC] He made something beautiful of my life â™ª
[time=542] We really appreciate the opportunity we have during this time in our service We have to sit down and talk with you who have joined us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=552] My wife Don and I counted a real privilege to take just a few moments and share with you pertinent information concerning the ministry of the Bible Hour into your life.
[time=561] During these days we have been sharing a very special Bible study help as a means of extending the Bible Hour into your home, helping you to study the Word of God for yourself.
[time=571] We have sat down as one of our major purposes of the Bible Hour, the encouragement of men and women in today's society to read the Bible for themselves.
[time=580] And so we have set aside a few moments in each of our services to share with you a special Bible study help that can be yours if you will get in touch with us.
[time=589] Don, I think you ought to tell them a little bit about this book which is called "Four Thousand Questions and Answers on the Bible."
[time=596] And that's exactly what it is. It's questions and answers consecutively on each book of the Bible.
[time=602] If you're reading a passage of Scripture, you just open the book to this and it helps you as you read that passage to ask important questions.
[time=610] And then if you can't figure out the answer, it gives you the answer for that particular passage.
[time=614] Don, what's the difference between this book and any old book that you might get on the questions about the Bible? What makes this so special?
[time=622] I think probably the special part is that it does give you the answers and in order you don't have to search for the answer because if you're studying a particular passage of Scripture, it deals with that particular passage.
[time=636] A lot of times if you're studying a book and you think, "Oh, I've seen that somewhere and it's hard to put your finger on it."
[time=642] I don't think there's anything more frustrating than to be studying the Bible.
[time=645] I know there's an answer someplace and perhaps you've even seen it, but you can't find out where it is. And that's the thing I think is such a unique feature about this book.
[time=653] It gives the questions and answers consecutively through the books of the Bible.
[time=657] And there are some other things in the book too that I think are helpful.
[time=660] For instance, one of the things that I think is a very helpful advantage in the back of the book is a section on the life of Christ, organizing the life of Christ through the four Gospels so that you can see how they fit together.
[time=671] And you were commenting on another part of it that seems quite interesting to you.
[time=675] There's a section in the back of the book that tells you how the Bible was formed, how it was all put together, the timing of it, and the authors.
[time=683] And it's just interesting to see how the word that we treasure so much was actually formed and put together.
[time=689] There's also another important little part back there.
[time=692] Many people have never studied the Bible for themselves before, and they're just now starting to do it on their own.
[time=698] And there's a section in there on tips of how to study the Bible.
[time=702] Oh, I'm sure that that will be of help to many people.
[time=705] We get so many comments from our own little Bible study group that share with us in our Bible study books each month as to how important it has been to them to learn how to get into the word for themselves.
[time=714] So this is really a very helpful manual, 4,000 questions and answers on the Bible, giving you key questions and answers as you read through the Scripture, and then many other helps at the end of the book that you'll want to treasure and encourage others to share with you.
[time=728] Now, Donna, this is not something we sell.
[time=731] We're not in the business of selling books, but we want to make this available to our many friends.
[time=735] And I think there are a couple of ways that we do that that are very significant, one which is very easy and which you usually share with our people.
[time=743] Almost all of us nowadays have a telephone.
[time=746] And we decided that the easiest way for you to get in touch with us was for you to call a toll-free number.
[time=752] And that number is 1-800-247-2160-1800-247-2160.
[time=762] All you need to do is ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like the book that was offered on today's broadcast.
[time=770] And Donna, there are many people who will do that, I'm sure right now.
[time=773] Some perhaps right now go to their phone and call us either that or write the number down so they can call later.
[time=779] That's a very economic way and very quick way to get in touch with us.
[time=783] There are many, however, who like to drop us a note and let us know that they're praying with us, sometimes to share with us a gift or an offering for the television ministry.
[time=791] And so if you'd like to write to us and request the book, that's as good a way for us to receive your word.
[time=797] And you can do that by writing to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=804] Let me give you that number again.
[time=806] Write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=812] Before we go back to the service, I need to share just one brief announcement and then we'll remind you again of our good number.
[time=818] And that is the announcement is this.
[time=820] Some weeks ago, we received word from our Syracuse outlet that they were being required to receive some special programming from the network.
[time=828] And we're going to have to make a severe change in the time of our telecast.
[time=832] Came as quite a blow to us since we've been on there such a short time.
[time=836] After carefully considering it, the board here at the church felt that it would not be a good use of the Lord's money if we were to accept the time which would be much early in the morning.
[time=846] So we have had to discontinue our ministry in Syracuse at least temporarily.
[time=850] I'd like to ask you to pray with us about that because that is not an encouraging word to us.
[time=855] We believe God sent us there for a purpose and we don't understand this detour that we have been taken on because of the station's requirement.
[time=865] We believe God has something better in store for us and we're trusting him to give us wisdom for it now.
[time=869] As always, at this particular time, your prayers and gifts are very encouraging to us as we try to maintain the Bible, our ministry here.
[time=877] We are committed to the fact that God would have His word disseminated throughout this country and that television is the key resource to do it.
[time=885] We're counting on all of you to stand with us and help us during these days.
[time=889] Donna, just before we go back to the service, why don't you remind them again of the number?
[time=893] That toll-free number is 1-800-247-2160 and remember to ask for the Bible, our operator.
[time=903] Just a few moments, I'm going to be opening the Scripture to share with you a passage of Scripture that tells us how important it is that we serve God from a heart of love.
[time=912] What is the purpose that you have in life as you serve the Lord in your family, in your sphere of influence?
[time=918] God's Word has the answer to that and we're going to share it together in just a few moments, so please stay with us.
[time=924] We have some more music and then in just a few moments we'll be opening our Bibles to John 21 to study together God's Word today.
[time=948] Him number 576 is our next song. It's "Sager," "Like a Shepherd," "Lead us." Him number 576.
[time=965] So we stand together now as we stand together.
[time=972] Every voice together.
[time=995] We stand together as we stand together as we stand together.
[time=1022] We stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together.
[time=1037] We stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together as we stand together.
[time=1067] [AMEN]
[time=1078] We have already shared with those here in the auditorium that next week here our guests will be Don Houston on the organ in the morning and Ellen Rotten who will be singing both morning and evening.
[time=1096] For those of you who are sharing this hour by television they will be seen in your area next week and we invite you to share their ministry with us.
[time=1105] I know that God will use them to challenge and encourage your heart musically.
[time=1109] We're so grateful for God's provision to us of the Kruger family.
[time=1114] It is a story that we will share and talk about for many days as we think about his wonderful hand of guidance and direction upon their lives and in the life of this church.
[time=1125] Already we've come to love them and appreciate them and we understand the spirit with which he ministers and the direction in which he seeks to lead us musically.
[time=1135] We thank God for them and for their ability.
[time=1138] We're going to ask that you listen now as Don Kruger ministers to us in music a song entitled "No one ever cared for me like Jesus."
[time=1155] I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found him a friend so strong and true.
[time=1171] I would tell you how he changed my life completely. He did something that no other friend could do.
[time=1189] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=1203] There's no other friend so kind as he did.
[time=1217] All of us could take the sin and darkness from me.
[time=1233] All how much he cared for me.
[time=1247] Every day he comes to me with new assurance. More and more I understand his words of love.
[time=1261] But I'll never know why he came to save me till some day I see his blessed face above.
[time=1277] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=1291] There's no other friend so kind as he did.
[time=1304] No one else could take the sin and darkness from me.
[time=1320] All how much he cared for me.
[time=1361] Isn't that a wonderful message in a world when it's often hard to determine who your friends are and who the ones are that really are concerned about you.
[time=1370] It is a great joy to know that there is one who is a friend that's sticketh closer than a brother.
[time=1376] No one cares for us more than our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1380] What you join me now is we open our Bibles to the 21st chapter of the book of John. John chapter 21.
[time=1392] We have been studying this postscript to the book of John and we have been looking together at this passage of Scripture, this 21st chapter as a manual for those who would serve the Lord.
[time=1407] As a textbook for those who are to minister, as a guidebook for those who are to be involved in reaching out to others.
[time=1419] I want to read together with you as you follow in your Bibles.
[time=1424] Beginning at verse 7 which takes us back into the previous text and brings us up to date just a bit and then carries us into today's lesson.
[time=1434] Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, it is the Lord.
[time=1439] Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he gird his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea.
[time=1446] And the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 qubits or about 100 yards dragging the net with fishes.
[time=1456] As soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and bred.
[time=1463] Jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which he have now caught. Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes in 150 and 3.
[time=1472] For all there were so many yet was not the net broken. Jesus saith unto them come and dine.
[time=1478] And none of the disciples dirst ask him who art thou Lord, knowing that it was the Lord.
[time=1483] Jesus then comeeth and takeeth bread and giveth them and fish likewise.
[time=1487] Now is the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead.
[time=1494] So when they had dined Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, love us thou me more than these.
[time=1500] He saith unto him ye, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him feed my lambs.
[time=1507] And he saith unto him again the second time. Simon son of Jonas, love us thou me.
[time=1513] He saith unto him ye, Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him feed my sheep.
[time=1519] He saith unto him the third time. Simon son of Jonas, love us thou me. And Peter was grieved
[time=1525] because he saith unto him the third time, love us thou me. And he saith unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things.
[time=1531] Thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him feed my sheep.
[time=1538] Shall we pray together? Father in Heaven, this is a great passage of Scripture to remind us of your love for us
[time=1548] and of how that love is a motivation for all that we do as we serve you.
[time=1554] Today you come into our hearts to ask of us as you ask of Peter, love us thou me.
[time=1560] And we're reminded how easy it is for us to profess with our lips that love, but when we are questioned
[time=1567] and when we are questioned by the word of God we sense that the Holy Spirit himself is examining our hearts.
[time=1574] We must confess, as did Peter, that our love for thee is so little of what it ought to be.
[time=1581] And in comparison to the great love wherewith we have been loved, we have so little to offer.
[time=1586] In fact, all that we can give thee, Father, is the response of your love for us.
[time=1590] We love you because you first loved us.
[time=1593] We have nothing in ourselves to bring thee except the reflection of God's love in our heart that is brought back to him who loved us.
[time=1604] We pray that today as we examine our motives for serving, as we look into our own hearts, as we see where we stand in relationship to our walk with the Lord, you will make us mindful of the priority of love that is here so beautifully illustrated.
[time=1623] We pray this in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1628] This past week we have had the privilege of hosting here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=1638] over 200 missionaries representing almost every country in the world.
[time=1643] Men and women who have given themselves and their lives to go out in a full-time capacity to serve the Lord God.
[time=1651] It has been a rich time for us as a church for we have rubbed shoulders with some of God's greatest people.
[time=1658] Not great according to the standards of the world, but great according to the principles of the Word.
[time=1663] Men and women who have faced up to the call of discipleship and have been willing, as we heard during the last night of the conference, to forsake all and follow the Lord.
[time=1672] Men and women who we could truly label disciples of Jesus Christ.
[time=1678] It is a sad but true thing that in the Christian church today we often make a distinction between those who are in "full-time service" and those who are just "ordinary Christians."
[time=1690] It is my conviction that in the terminology of the Holy Spirit there is no such thing as an ordinary Christian, and that God has no such distinctions when he terms disciples full-time or part-time.
[time=1702] According to the Word of God, we are all called into His service. We are all to be disciples of the Master.
[time=1709] We are all to follow Him. We are all to be motivated by the same overwhelming principle of God's love for us
[time=1717] that causes us to reach out to those around us.
[time=1721] I am comforted, however, as I reflect upon the New Testament and discover that in the lives of the disciples who walked for three years with the Master,
[time=1729] they often struggled with the dichotomy of their lives, sometimes questioning whether or not the mundane things of the fishing ministry
[time=1738] were as important as the calling to be a follower of Christ and a fisher of men.
[time=1744] In the passage that we have been reading, we have been following the Lord as He teaches His disciples
[time=1750] the dynamic truth that in serving Him there is no such thing as that which pertains to self
[time=1756] and that which pertains to the Savior, but that all of our lives are to be an outflow of the Lord's direction to us
[time=1762] and a response to His leadership over us.
[time=1766] We have followed the disciples and the leadership of Peter as in futility they put out from the shore
[time=1773] to go back to their previous profession of fishing.
[time=1776] We have seen them do it throughout one night's duration.
[time=1780] We have watched as they came up dry with nothing to show for their activity.
[time=1784] We have learned from this experience that it is possible for a Christian to go back on his commitment and to say as Peter did I go fishing which being interpreted means I am going back to living the way I used to live.
[time=1796] We have discovered that when we try to do things as a Christian without the Lord it is nothing short of absolute futility.
[time=1804] Last week as we looked into this text we discovered that Christ wants us to be fruitful
[time=1810] and the principles of fruitfulness are illustrated here in the word that is before us.
[time=1815] These principles began when we realize our emptiness without God when we are willing to say with the disciples in response to the question of the Master have you any meat.
[time=1827] We are willing to say no we have nothing to show for our activity.
[time=1831] It is when we realize that we are empty that the Lord can fill us.
[time=1835] We learned also that fruitfulness is a response to the word of God.
[time=1840] That when Christ speaks and he commands our fruitfulness is dependent upon immediate obedience.
[time=1846] When he says to us to cast the net on the other side we do not debate or dialogue we immediately obey.
[time=1853] We have learned also from this passage of Scripture that this matter of fruitfulness is a recognition of the power of God in our lives as we go about our service.
[time=1863] And when he blesses us and when he uses us and when there is a great magnitude of fruit we are willing to say with the disciples it is the Lord.
[time=1871] And to give him his due glory for of ourselves we can do nothing we have no right to claim the power for service.
[time=1880] We learned also as we studied the principles of fruitfulness that the power of Christ is available to us in his personal presence as we go about our tasks.
[time=1891] As Peter came rushing ahead of the disciples to sit at the coals of fire with his master he drew upon the presence of Christ in his life a special power which enabled him to draw in a net that six good men could not possibly bring to land.
[time=1905] He had been at the feet of the Savior and from the feet of the Savior he went forth to serve.
[time=1910] Oh if as Christians we could begin with these basic lessons to learn what God would teach us from his word.
[time=1918] The passage moves us now to a ministry to the disciples as a group to the ministry that Christ would have to Peter as an individual.
[time=1928] Before we get into that I must share with you a concise outline of where we have been.
[time=1933] This past week I was talking with Dr. Don Jennings who was a good friend and we were sharing together some reflection upon this passage.
[time=1941] He said you know I have a sermon on John 21 2 and it's very simple. I said oh is that right. He said let me give you the outline.
[time=1948] It goes like this. Go fish Peter's words all night no fish and then in the morning oh fish that's the outline.
[time=1960] Go fish no fish and oh fish. Now if you remember that you remember where we've been.
[time=1965] Peter said I go fishing they caught nothing and in the morning when the Lord spoke the net was full.
[time=1972] Now the Lord invites them to a time of fellowship around the fire and the scripture is so clear as to the preciousness of this moment.
[time=1983] It says in verse 13 that when they had come to sit with the Lord around the coals Jesus cometh and takeeth bread and he giveth them fish likewise.
[time=1994] The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ made the disciples to sit down and he took the place of a waiter.
[time=2001] Don't be afraid to say that Jesus Christ the waiter.
[time=2007] This is what Jesus did. He carried the bread around to them. He wanted to wait on them to serve them.
[time=2015] He wanted to fill their needs until they were satisfied and he personally ministered to all of the disciples around the fire that day.
[time=2023] He prepared the food and he gave the food to all who were there.
[time=2027] It is a reminder to us of that time in the thirteenth chapter of John earlier in his ministry before his death when he donned the clothes of a slave and he washed the disciples feet.
[time=2040] It is a reminder to us in this passage of service that he that would be greatest among you let him be the least.
[time=2047] It is a reminder to us that the pyramid of service in the Christian realm is an inverted pyramid and we are at the bottom serving all of those to whom God has called us.
[time=2056] Jesus Christ illustrated that principle to his disciples. He ministered to them as a group.
[time=2063] But having ministered to them as a group now he singles out Peter to minister to him.
[time=2068] Someone says why did he pick on Peter again?
[time=2072] You will remember Peter is the one who got them out in the lake in the first place.
[time=2076] Peter was sort of like the key log in the log jam and I'm sure the Lord thought that if he could dislodge Peter from his own selfish ways the rest of the disciples were sure to follow and of course that in truth is what happened.
[time=2088] So the Lord comes to Peter and he begins to speak to him about the intimate fellowship of service.
[time=2096] There are three questions in this passage that the Lord asks Peter.
[time=2101] This is one of the most beautiful passages of Scripture in the entire gospel of John.
[time=2106] Three times the Lord comes to Peter and asks him do you love me?
[time=2110] Three times Peter answers and though the English text looks as if it is simply a repetition of the same question when you look at the language of the Bible, when you look at the Greek language you discover that there is a play on with the Bible.
[time=2125] There is a play on words here and that the Lord is really dealing with Peter concerning his allegiance and his faithfulness to service.
[time=2134] In the three questions that are asked there is a question and an answer and then a command.
[time=2140] Do you love me Peter? And Peter answers and then the Lord says something to Peter.
[time=2145] When I was studying English which has been a long time ago and that is probably evident to those of you who must sit under my ministry weekly.
[time=2154] When I was studying English and grammar I learned that there were ways of delineating different descriptions.
[time=2162] There was a positive and a comparative and a superlative.
[time=2168] These terms describe the adjectives we use in determining how something is to be viewed in our perspective.
[time=2176] The positive, the comparative and the superlative.
[time=2179] Now if we could start in reverse what Christ is doing with Peter is this.
[time=2183] He is asking him three questions. He is asking him the superlative question.
[time=2187] The utmost question. Then he dains to step down a few pages in Peter's life and ask him the comparative question.
[time=2195] And finally he has to come down to where Peter is and ask him the positive question.
[time=2200] Let's look at these questions in order. First of all the superlative question.
[time=2205] The Bible says that Jesus after they had finished eating came to Peter and said, "Simon son of Jonas, love us thou me more than these."
[time=2218] You will remember that Peter it was who had denied the Lord three times.
[time=2223] You will remember that he stood by the fire and said he never knew the Lord.
[time=2227] You will also know from studying this passage of Scripture that it was Peter who led the disciples back to their previous occupation
[time=2234] and it is evident in the text as you study those words that Peter wasn't just saying, "Let's pass the time fishing." He was saying, "Let's go back to what we used to do.
[time=2242] There's no sense waiting to follow the Master anymore." Peter was the rebel who had denied the Lord and now the Lord Jesus Christ comes to and lovingly picks him up
[time=2251] and begins to bring him back into fellowship with himself.
[time=2254] Someone has said that it is not enough to lift with the arms. We must lift with the heart as well.
[time=2260] When we are called forth to restore someone who is out of fellowship, we must not go to them simply with the arms. We must go in the compassion of heart to bring them back.
[time=2269] And that's what Jesus is doing as he addresses Peter and he calls him by his pre-disciple name.
[time=2276] Do you notice it? Simon son of Jonah, he said, "Do you love me?"
[time=2282] Before he ever asked the question, the words of the Savior pierced through to Peter's heart and caught him up short.
[time=2288] He had not been called Simon in a long time. There had been a day in Peter's life when the Lord said to him,
[time=2295] "Peter, you will not any longer be called Simon.
[time=2299] I'm going to call you Peter, Petra, rocks, stability." And upon this rock, Jesus Christ, he said, "I will build my church." And throughout his ministry as a disciple, the Lord had called him Peter.
[time=2314] But now he comes to him in these closing moments before he goes back to heaven and he says to him, "Simon." And when he said that word, it must have just reminded Peter of how far he had fallen from fellowship with the Lord.
[time=2327] That was the name he used to be called before the Lord put his hand upon him for special service.
[time=2333] It reminds me the story I heard some time ago of a young man who was in a local church
[time=2341] and became convicted that he ought to lose weight, for he was very, very heavy, about 200 pounds overweight.
[time=2349] And he worked diligently to get off that weight, so much so that after about a year of dieting, everybody began to call him Slim.
[time=2358] That was a beautiful name to him. It represented everything he had striven for in all those days.
[time=2365] But alas, he went off to college and he began to eat that good institutional food.
[time=2373] And after he ate that institutional food for a while in those late night snacks, he put on almost all of the weight he had lost.
[time=2379] And he came home at the end of his first year and he walked in among the congregation. And the first thing somebody said to him was,
[time=2386] "Hi there, big boy." Oh, how that stung. It represented to him everything that had been true of him before he had dealt with his problem.
[time=2396] And that must have certainly been what happened to Peter when the Lord said to him, "Simon, son of Jonas."
[time=2403] And in his heart, he must have reacted, "Lord, that's not my name. Oh yes, that's your name, because you're right back where you used to be before I put my hand upon you."
[time=2412] And then he asked him this question. He said, "Simon, do you love me more than these?"
[time=2419] Oh, there's a great deal of discussion as to the meaning of the phrase "more than these." It could be one of three things. Let me give them to you. First of all, he may have been saying to him, "Simon, do you love me more than these disciples love me?"
[time=2432] Looking around at the circle, he could have said, "Simon, do you really love me more than these disciples love me?"
[time=2439] Or perhaps he could have meant, "Simon, do you love me more than you love these disciples? Is your love for me more than your love for those who are standing around here?"
[time=2449] Or perhaps he meant, "Do you love me, Simon, more than you love these fish that you've caught?"
[time=2456] And if that were the question, it would be a question that would zero in on the heart of Peter who had decided to go back to his previous occupation,
[time=2463] and perhaps the Lord was saying to him, "Simon, I want to ask you a question. Is your love for me? Let me ask you now. Is your love for me greater than your love for this mundane occupation of fishing?
[time=2474] Do you love me more than these fish?" It would be commensurate to the Lord asking us as he looked at our lives and our professions,
[time=2480] and especially in this church, that to which we aspire in terms of success in the secular life.
[time=2485] The Lord pointing his finger at me, "Are you and saying, 'Do you love me more than you love this secular job that you have?'"
[time=2495] I don't pretend to know exactly what he was referring to, but I would like to share with you that in the 26th chapter of the Book of Matthew and in verse 33,
[time=2508] Peter had made a confession before the Lord and in front of the other disciples that perhaps the Lord was referring to here in this passage.
[time=2517] In Matthew 26 and verse 33, "The Lord had been preparing his disciples for his death and telling them that they would be scattered as sheep across the face of the earth."
[time=2529] Listen to Peter now, and he says, "Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended."
[time=2537] Perhaps the Lord was saying, "Peter, do you remember what you said back then? I want to ask you this question. Do you really love me more than they?"
[time=2545] You said, "Peter, that though everyone else would offend me, you wouldn't, but I'm asking you this question now." Is that really true? Do you love me more than these?
[time=2554] Now in the Greek language, there are two words for love, and many of you are aware of that.
[time=2562] There is a word which we would translate agape, agape love. You've seen that word transliterated in some of the ministries.
[time=2569] There is a group that goes about the country today called the agape players.
[time=2574] That word is just the Greek word for love. It is the highest form of love that the world knows and that the Bible teaches.
[time=2581] Agape love is the characteristic word of Christianity. It is the word which describes God's love for men.
[time=2589] It is the word found in John 3.16. For God so there's the word agape the world.
[time=2596] It is a word which is descriptive of the love of the Father for the Son and the love of the Father for the world.
[time=2604] This term agape is a love that is called out of a person's heart. It is a supernatural love, and that is the word which is used in verses 15 and 16
[time=2614] when Christ speaks to Peter and says to him, "Peter, do you agape me? Do you love me?"
[time=2620] There is another word in the Greek language for love which we would pronounce in our language by the word phil-o.
[time=2627] And that is sort of a phil-o love. It is a tender affection. It is the kind of love that we have for other people because of our excitement in the presence of that person.
[time=2638] Sometimes it is a selfish love almost. It is a love we have for someone because of what that person can do for us or what that person does for us.
[time=2646] It is a friendly love. It is an unimpassioned love. Keep those two words in mind for they are used in this text very, very poignantly by our Savior.
[time=2656] Now the first question, if I could read it, goes like this. Simon, Son of Jonas, "Do you agape me? Do you love me with a supernatural love?"
[time=2671] And Peter answered, "Lord, thou knowest that I phil-o thee." Simon, Son of Jonas, "Do you love me with a God honoring supernatural love?"
[time=2684] And Simon said, "Lord, you know that I am fond of you." And it is not in the text but certainly the Lord knew that he had scored.
[time=2694] Simon must have said, "I can't say that I love the Lord with that kind of love. I'll just have to admit that I'm fond of him." Why?
[time=2702] Way back in the 26th chapter of the book of Matthew, again let me refresh your memory. In verses 69 to 75 we read this about Peter.
[time=2711] Now Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying, "Thou also wasst with Jesus of Galilee." But he denied before them all saying, "I do not know what thou sayest, denial number one."
[time=2725] And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him and said unto them that were there, this fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=2733] And he denied with an oath, this time he swore, and he said, "I don't know that man." And after a while came unto him that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely thou also art one of them for thy speech betrayeth thee."
[time=2746] Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, "I know not the man." And immediately the cock crew and Peter remembered the word of Jesus which said unto him, "Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice."
[time=2758] And he went out and whipped bitterly. And now the Lord Jesus comes to Peter and he says, "Simon son of Jonas, do you agape me?"
[time=2767] And into Peter's mind flashed the memory of his denial of the Lord knowing he was standing in front of an omniscient God.
[time=2773] He said, "Lord, you know that I'm fond of you." And the Lord said, "Simon feed my sheep, feed my little lambs."
[time=2783] The next question comes to him in verse 16.
[time=2787] And he saith unto him again the second time, "Simon son of Jonas, dost thou agape, dost thou love me?"
[time=2796] He saith unto him, "Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I am fond of thee."
[time=2804] And the Lord said unto him, "Feed my sheep. Lord, thou knowest that I am fond of you."
[time=2811] And the Scripture says he came unto him the third time, and this time the Lord condescends to use Peter's terminology.
[time=2818] And he says, "In the third question, Simon son of Jonas, do you for let owe me?"
[time=2824] Oh, how that must have stung Peter. It is bad enough that he be questioned on his supernatural love.
[time=2830] But now the Lord comes to him and he says, "Simon, you've been telling me that you're fond of me. Now I ask you, are you really fond of me?"
[time=2838] And the Scripture reports quite accurately that when Simon heard that question, he was grieved in his heart.
[time=2846] Because the third time the Lord had said to him, "Do you really love me? Are you fond of me?"
[time=2854] And Peter said, "Lord, you've asked me now if I have a tender thought in my heart concerning you.
[time=2862] You've asked me if I've fond of you. Lord, you know all things, and you know that I love thee."
[time=2870] And the Lord gave him another command. Will you notice the progression in these questions?
[time=2876] In the first instance, the Lord asked him the superlative question.
[time=2880] He said, "Simon son of Peter, do you agape me? Do you love me with supernatural love that supersedes the love of all of these disciples around thee?"
[time=2890] And in Peter's response, he weakened the answer in two ways.
[time=2894] First of all, he said, "Lord, you know that I'm fond of you using the weaker word." And secondly, he left off the phrase more than these.
[time=2902] He didn't use that. He just simply said, "Lord, you know I'm fond of you."
[time=2908] The second time the Lord came back and asked him a question that was weakened because he left off the more than these phrase.
[time=2915] And he said, "Simon, let me ask you again, not about your superlative love. I'm not even asking you to compare your love to the love around you.
[time=2921] Let me just ask it to you this way. Do you love me with agape love?" And again, Peter responded, "Lord, you know that I'm fond of you." And finally, the third time the Lord comes down to use Peter's word for love.
[time=2937] No longer is he talking here about supernatural love.
[time=2941] He simply says, "Peter, let me ask you a question. Are you really fond of me?"
[time=2947] Oh, how his heart was grieved.
[time=2951] You know, I believe that God put those questions in the Bible not just for Peter, but for us.
[time=2958] Is it possible in our Christian experience that we like Peter have gone back upon our commitment?
[time=2965] Having walked with the Lord as he's directed us through the years of our lives and the years of our ministry,
[time=2971] have we come to the place where, like Peter, we have stood by the fire of the enemy and denied that we knew the Lord?
[time=2978] Perhaps not with our lips, have we cursed, but with our lives we have brought reproach to the Savior.
[time=2985] We have said that we loved him, we have walked with him, and yet our very lives betray us as Peter's speech betrayed him.
[time=2993] Is it possible that the Lord is coming to us today and saying to each of us, Simon, John, Judy, Mary, Ted, whoever it might be,
[time=3005] do you really love me?
[time=3008] When you came into my family and God was brought very near to you and you had that first blush of Christianity
[time=3015] and that supernatural love that just bubbled over, there was something special about you.
[time=3019] But what's happened in your life now? Do you really love me more than these?
[time=3024] And he asks us to take a look at our priorities.
[time=3027] And he asks us to determine whether or not our love for him is as it should be, greater than the love of others for him and greater than our love for the things around us.
[time=3037] We have to come back and say, Lord, I want to be honest with you because you can't be fooled.
[time=3043] I am fond of you.
[time=3048] He looks deep into our heart and he drops off the comparison with others' love and the comparison with this world's goods.
[time=3054] And he asks us again, is your love for me a great and godly supernatural love?
[time=3060] And in a moment of introspection, we look into our hearts and we want to say, yes, Lord, I agop.
[time=3066] But the words stick in our throat because we know that he sees us and he watches us and he's seeing what we do and how we live and we have to respond again.
[time=3074] Honestly, Lord, you know I'm fond of you.
[time=3079] And finally, the Lord comes down to where we live and he says to us, David, are you really fond of me?
[time=3085] You say that you have a fondness, a filial love for me, a tender, unimpassioned love for me.
[time=3091] Do you really? And our hearts are grieved.
[time=3095] And we have to appeal to the omniscient God and say, Lord, you know, all things, you know that we love you.
[time=3103] It is interesting to me that in response to all three of the question and answers in this text,
[time=3109] there is a command.
[time=3111] The first command is a command that Christ gave to Peter and it would be translated this way.
[time=3116] Peter feed my lambs.
[time=3119] In the second question he said, Peter, are you loving me?
[time=3124] And Peter said, Lord, you know that I'm fond of you and the Lord said to him, feed my sheep a different word or shepherd my sheep.
[time=3133] And in the third question he said, Peter, do you love me?
[time=3138] Are you fond of me? And Peter said, Lord, you know all things.
[time=3140] You know that I am and the Lord said to him, you feed my sheep.
[time=3145] Do you not see that the lesson of service here is this?
[time=3149] That as we seek to do the work of God, it is not possible for us to feed the sheep
[time=3155] and to tend the little ones and care for those who need help unless our love for God
[time=3161] is the supernatural kind of love that he alone can give.
[time=3166] I want to tell you as a pastor who has acquainted somewhat with the brokenness of life in our world today
[time=3172] that human love cannot reach out to solve those hurts and meet those problems.
[time=3177] As I tend the sheep and pastor the sheep and care for the little ones, there is no way that in the human perspective of love that job can be accomplished and done right.
[time=3188] Every day we must be on our knees to call down from heaven more of that godly love that he's promised to shed abroad in our hearts to reach out to those because it is the agape love that the world is looking for, the unselfish love that is the reflection of God's love.
[time=3202] They cannot feel the love of God unless that love of God is coming out through us to them.
[time=3207] And so the Lord is saying to all of us who would serve him today, I have a job for you to do, but the question I must ask you is this, do you love me?
[time=3218] Is your love for me greater than your love for all else?
[time=3224] Later in his life as Peter would sit down with pen in hand to write that book which bears his name,
[time=3230] it is obvious that the lesson which the Lord tried to teach him in these closing moments of his life on this earth was learned well.
[time=3237] For over in 1 Peter chapter 5 verses 2 through 4, Peter passes on this information to all who would serve
[time=3245] and listen to what he says, 1 Peter 5, 2, feed the flock of God which is among you,
[time=3252] taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy liquor but of a ready mind,
[time=3259] neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock, and when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
[time=3270] Feed the flock of God, said Peter, and that lesson was so indelibly placed upon Peter's heart,
[time=3278] his love for God was the key to his service to others that from that moment on, beginning in the book of Acts,
[time=3285] we read of a different kind of man who went out and with the power of God's love in his heart turned the world upside down.
[time=3293] It is true what the modern songwriter has written.
[time=3299] What the world needs now is love, sweet love, but not for love.
[time=3306] Oh, there's plenty of that around.
[time=3308] What the world needs is the supernatural kind of love that reaches beyond man's comprehension to understand
[time=3314] and meets and fills the needs in the lives of people and heals the hurts, and it is obvious to those who are the recipients of it that it is God's love being ministered through the heart of a faithful servant who first of all loves God and then lets that love reach out and touch other people.
[time=3330] And that's the calling that God has given to all of us as we serve him.
[time=3335] Do you love me?
[time=3338] Feed my sheep.
[time=3340] Shall we pray?
[time=3344] Father, use this passage of Scripture to instill within our hearts the realization that love is the greatest motive the world knows today
[time=3356] and that when we feel the love of God in our hearts, when we sense that we love him with all of our hearts,
[time=3363] we are fit then to go out and do his work.

[time=3544] That's the gift of salvation.
[time=3546] If you have never personally prayed to invite Jesus Christ into your life and accepted Him as your Savior, I wonder if we might pray with you in that.
