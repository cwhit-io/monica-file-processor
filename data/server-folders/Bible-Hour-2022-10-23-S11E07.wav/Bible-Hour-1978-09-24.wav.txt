[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We
[time=23] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Gerrimon.
[time=29] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=50] I am certain that most of you at one time or another have had the privilege of singing the chorus, "Oh, how I love Jesus." I wonder when you sing that song,
[time=61] if you really mean what you sing. I wonder if you can honestly say in your own
[time=68] life that the most important relationship that you have on this earth is a relationship that reaches beyond this earth to the Savior in heaven. Do you really love Him? Do you really love Jesus Christ? Today we're going to examine
[time=85] that from the Word of God. We'll take a little quiz along with Peter and examine our own hearts as we reflect upon that question and if we can come to the place of giving the right answer, what a difference it will make in our lives as we serve Him. We have a wonderful service plan today at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. We are the recipients of the overflowed blessing from a music conference that took place here yesterday and our guest today are Mr. Don Houston at the organ and Ellen Rotten, one of our favorite soloists and they
[time=120] will be ministering to us in just a few moments. Right now we want you to listen carefully to our choir. They're going to sing a song that was arranged by Don Houston. He will accompany them at the organ. It is a special song to us because of the name of our television program. It is a song entitled "The Bible Stands" and this is the Bible Hour as you share it at home and this song has a special
[time=145] ministry and message to all of us who believe that this is God's Word and we teach it and preach it and we try to live it. I hope you will enjoy this ministry from our choir directed by Don Kruger, accompanied at the organ by Don Houston and at the piano by Paul Turner and they sing for us an arrangement of the song entitled "The Bible Stands."
[time=188] like a rock and a knot in with the raging storms of time.
[time=196] These pages learn with the truth, the journal and they go with the lights of line.
[time=205] The Bible stands through the hills near Tumball.
[time=212] We will burn this man when we are a child from home. I look back my feet on his firm
[time=220] foundation for the Bible Stands, for Bible Stands.
[time=230] We will forever win the world as fast away, as fast away.
[time=241] Oh, it's free since I will obey, we'll build and we'll see.
[time=254] Oh, I look back my feet on his firm foundation for the Bible Stands, for Bible Stands.
[time=273] The Bible stands every task we give in for his operation by, the grace of all that is
[time=289] made in it and to bring and make it by, the Bible stands for the hills near Tumball.
[time=302] We will forever stand the village of Tumball.
[time=307] I will never be on his firm foundation for the Bible Stands, for Bible Stands.
[time=323] Thank you, choir, for reminding us of a great truth that we all believe and that we appreciate
[time=338] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church where we teach and preach the word of the Lord.
[time=343] We want to say a special word of appreciation to our friends at the Hedman Music Company who have cooperated with us in allowing these our guests to be with us today and who also have provided the beautiful Rogers organ that Don Houston is playing.
[time=358] We want to ask Mr. Houston if he will share with us some of his artistry now.
[time=363] I want you to listen carefully to a ministry in music from the Rogers organ as it is played by our special guest, Mr. Don Houston.
[time=388] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=533] Thank you, Mr. Houston, for that good number and we'll have the privilege of hearing them
[time=541] again in just a few moments as we share in the ministry of the offering.
[time=545] Right now we want you to welcome back to the Black Hawk Baptist Church our special friend Ellen Rotten and she's here to sing for us today for those of you who are part of this church not only this morning but in the evening service as well.
[time=558] She's going to share two numbers for us now and say just a word along the way to let us know that how things are happening with her and I trust that you will listen and really rejoice as she shares with us in music right now.
[time=572] [MUSIC]
[time=578] When in the spring the flowers are blooming bright and fair after the grey of winter's
[time=596] dawn. Once again, the lake begins its tuning back in the meadows of my heart.
[time=622] O'er the land of the land bring that the springtime.
[time=633] Take away the cold and dark of sea.
[time=644] All return to me, sweet Holy Spirit.
[time=655] May I warm and turn.
[time=660] Be again.
[time=667] Lord make me like that stream that flows so cool and clear.
[time=678] Down from the mountains high above.
[time=689] I will tell the world that what the story of the stream that flowed from come over me.
[time=711] And go to my heart bring that the springtime.
[time=722] Take away the cold and dark of sea.
[time=733] All return to me, sweet Holy Spirit.
[time=744] May I warm and turn.
[time=749] Be again.
[time=756] May I warm and turn.
[time=761] Be again.
[time=768] [MUSIC]
[time=775] God commands us to witness boldly but with hearts of tenderness and gentleness full of
[time=784] compassion for others.
[time=786] How he wants us to be reflections of his love.
[time=790] Christ be beside me.
[time=795] [MUSIC]
[time=807] Christ be beside me.
[time=821] King of my heart.
[time=825] Christ be within me.
[time=830] Christ be below me.
[time=834] Christ be above me.
[time=839] Never to hurt.
[time=843] Christ on thy right hand.
[time=848] Christ on my left hand.
[time=852] Christ all around me.
[time=857] Shield in the strife.
[time=862] Christ in my sleeping.
[time=866] Christ in my sitting.
[time=875] Light of my love.
[time=879] [MUSIC]
[time=885] Christ be in all hearts.
[time=890] Staking above me.
[time=894] Christ be on all's hearts.
[time=899] Stelling above me.
[time=903] Christ be the vision.
[time=907] Christ be beside me.
[time=937] King of my heart.
[time=941] Christ be within me.
[time=946] Christ be below me.
[time=950] Christ be above me.
[time=955] Never to hurt.
[time=960] [MUSIC]
[time=965] Christ be in me.
[time=970] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=982] Thank you so much for letting us have these moments with you in your home.
[time=986] While we're taking the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, it's my privilege and that of my wife Donna to share with you at home the things that are happening here in the Bible, our ministry.
[time=996] And we counted a real privilege to just chat with you for a few moments in the middle of our service, let you know what's going on here.
[time=1003] We have a special prayer request that we want to bring before you at this time, and it relates to the Enrollment Project for the Founders Club.
[time=1010] Donna, just in a few sentences, tell our folks what is the Founders Club.
[time=1014] The Founders Club is a group of people who have banded together to support the Bible hour.
[time=1020] They are people from many walks of life and in many different states and communities who have a desire to see the gospel presented over the airwaves.
[time=1029] And without them we would have no chance whatsoever of being able to reach out through the ministry of television.
[time=1036] Our purpose and goal during these next three months is to enroll 500 new Founders Club members.
[time=1041] And that's a tremendous task. It is something only God can do.
[time=1045] And so we need to spend some time and prayer together as a family of Bible hour watchers, Bible hour friends, and praying together that God would help us to achieve that goal.
[time=1056] Now today we want to talk to you about a special gift offer that we have prepared for you at home.
[time=1061] Some of you have already written and called for it, but many of you are yet to do that.
[time=1065] It's a little book entitled "Four Thousand Questions and Answers on the Bible." Donna this week as I came through the kitchen one morning I saw your Bible study books laid out on the kitchen table and among them was this little book. What were you doing?
[time=1079] We started an exciting new ministry this week at Black Ock and that is the Women Alive Bible Study group.
[time=1086] And as I was preparing to do my study for this week's lesson I took out my little book and went through it to see what questions I could find answered in there.
[time=1095] Well, and that's just one of the very few uses that we have available to us.
[time=1101] There are many many opportunities to use this in your daily Bible study.
[time=1105] And so we'd like to have you share with us in this Bible study tool.
[time=1110] And the way that you do that is simply by letting us know that you'd like to have it.
[time=1114] There's a couple of exciting ways to do that now with modern communication means.
[time=1118] One of them is by the use of a special telephone number that we have chosen for your use.
[time=1124] Donna tell them about that.
[time=1126] We have set up a toll-free number which you may call at any hour of the day or night any time during the week and that number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1137] And again you can call it at any time perhaps the best time to do it would be right after the Bible hour goes off the year when it's fresh on your mind.
[time=1145] That number once again to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1150] Just ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like the book that was offered on today's program.
[time=1157] And once again that's a free telephone call from any place in the United States.
[time=1161] Just call 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1165] And when they answer you ask for the Bible hour and request the book 4,000 questions and answers on the Bible.
[time=1171] Of course we'd like to hear from you in the mail as well.
[time=1174] And when you write you need to address your letter to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1183] One of the exciting things about writing is that you can communicate to us directly and let us know what the Bible hour is meaning in your own life.
[time=1190] We would appreciate hearing from many of you this week as God lays it upon your heart to close the communication cycle
[time=1196] and get back to us with some feedback on the Bible hour ministry.
[time=1200] I trust that you will take time this week to write or call and request your free copy of this special Bible study book.
[time=1207] Once again the telephone number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1214] And remember to ask for the Bible hour operator.
[time=1217] And now we're going to get back to our morning service.
[time=1220] And I trust that you'll stay with us as in just a few moments we open the Word of God and share together one of the most dynamic questions that's ever been asked to any of us.
[time=1230] A question that will determine whether or not we go on with the Lord.
[time=1233] It's found in that chapter we're studying John chapter 21.
[time=1237] I hope you'll share it with us in just a few moments.
[time=1240] We're grateful for the privilege we have had today of sharing in the artistry of Don Houston.
[time=1249] Unfortunately he can't stay to be with us tonight but I know you'll want to express to him your appreciation for his ministry.
[time=1254] Yesterday I was called out of a business meeting and went to the home of a young man of our fellowship who lost his father.
[time=1265] Some of you know Dave Norton and yesterday early in the morning his father went home to be with the Lord.
[time=1271] He's only been a Christian a year.
[time=1273] And the last night I was visiting in their home and met some of their friends.
[time=1277] They had also lost someone in their home just within the last two or three weeks.
[time=1282] I came back to the church last night where we were having a concert just in time to hear Ellen Rotten introduce a new song
[time=1290] that John Peterson had just written that I had never heard her sing before.
[time=1294] And my heart was filled with the experience around the table with these who were Christians but were mourning because of those that they loved.
[time=1302] And then I heard the message of this song and I ask Ellen if she would sing it for us again.
[time=1307] I think you'll understand why when you hear the words.
[time=1312] [MUSIC]
[time=1331] I've been through the valley.
[time=1341] I've walked through deep water.
[time=1345] I've bowed in the mud.
[time=1349] I've fought in the battle with courage, old God.
[time=1359] But this is the reason.
[time=1362] I always go.
[time=1368] Jesus is with me, my shepherd and guide.
[time=1376] All that I need.
[time=1381] He is there to proclaim.
[time=1385] And that makes the difference, this friend by my side.
[time=1394] Jesus is walking with me.
[time=1403] I've known disappointment.
[time=1408] I've suffered through loss.
[time=1413] I've felt on my shoulder the weight of a cross.
[time=1421] I've wept in the darkness and wished for the light that somehow his presence gave songs in the night.
[time=1441] I've lapped on the mountain.
[time=1446] I've savored success.
[time=1451] Retoiced in my blessings in more than in less.
[time=1460] I've tasted the good life while praising his name.
[time=1469] In sunshine or shadow, it's always the same.
[time=1477] Jesus is with me, my shepherd and guide.
[time=1486] All that I need is there to proclaim.
[time=1495] And that makes the difference, this friend by my side.
[time=1504] Jesus is walking with me.
[time=1541] Thank you, Ellen.
[time=1547] And you know something as Christians, we look at each other when we face difficulties and say with assurance, Jesus is the difference.
[time=1556] And it's easy to see it.
[time=1558] You don't have to be in a room very long before you recognize that there's something different.
[time=1562] And it comes out in the crisis that there is a difference in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1566] That's a beautiful song.
[time=1567] We thank God for the privilege of sharing in that ministry to our hearts.
[time=1571] Well, let's take our Bibles again and turn to the 21st chapter of the book of John.
[time=1576] John's Gospel, chapter 21.
[time=1584] Sometimes soon, I will make it through this chapter.
[time=1587] But every time I get started down the road a little further, I get arrested again by something that sticks out of the chapter and catches me by surprise and causes me to meditate and consider and think.
[time=1600] We're not as far as we're supposed to be at this time in this series of messages, but I'm not going to worry about it if God wants to speak to us a little bit longer from this portion of his word.
[time=1609] That's all right.
[time=1610] And we'll just listen carefully to what he has to say to us.
[time=1613] I want to remind you again of a passage in the last part of chapter 21,
[time=1620] beginning at verse 15.
[time=1622] I want you to read along in your Bibles as I read aloud from mine.
[time=1626] So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter.
[time=1629] Simon son of Jonah, love us thou me more than these.
[time=1634] He saith unto him, yea, Lord thou knowest that I love thee.
[time=1637] He saith unto him feed my lambs.
[time=1640] He saith to him again the second time.
[time=1642] Simon son of Jonah, love us thou me.
[time=1645] He saith unto him, yea, Lord thou knowest that I love thee.
[time=1649] He saith unto him feed my sheep.
[time=1651] He saith unto him the third time.
[time=1653] Simon son of Jonah, love us thou me.
[time=1657] Peter was grieved because he saith unto him the third time.
[time=1660] Love us thou me.
[time=1661] And he saith unto him, Lord thou knowest all things.
[time=1663] Thou knowest that I love thee.
[time=1665] Jesus saith unto him feed my sheep.
[time=1667] Verily, verily, I saith unto thee when thou was young.
[time=1670] Thou girdest thyself and walkest where thou wouldest.
[time=1673] But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands.
[time=1676] And another shall gird thee and carry thee where thou wouldest not.
[time=1681] This spoke he signifying by what death he should glorify God.
[time=1685] And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, follow me.
[time=1690] Let us pray.
[time=1694] Our Father in heaven, we thank you for this word that comes to our hearts today directly.
[time=1701] We don't need any new translation or paraphrase to understand it.
[time=1705] It's clear, it's present.
[time=1707] It pricks our hearts, brings conviction to our soul.
[time=1712] Lord, we pray that just as really as Peter stood at the end of your outstretched arm,
[time=1718] when you questioned him concerning his love, you will allow us for these few moments that we are together to hear those questions directed at us.
[time=1728] Lord, help us to understand that thou art the one who knowest what is in man and to answer truthfully.
[time=1736] We pray, Lord, that you will help us to be fair as we examine our own hearts.
[time=1743] That we be honest, recognizing that we have nothing to gain by attempting to fool an omniscient God.
[time=1751] We ask that you will quiet our hearts now before thee.
[time=1754] Cause us to hear the still small voice of the Spirit of God as he speaks to us in these moments from his word.
[time=1762] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1769] Tradition has it that at the end of the life of the Apostle Peter, he was brought forward and asked to deny his faith.
[time=1779] And when he would not, he was sentenced to be crucified.
[time=1783] When they took him to the Roman cross for his execution, he requested that he be hung upside down.
[time=1793] Because said Peter, I am not worthy to be crucified in the same manner as my Lord.
[time=1802] That's a strange thing for us to be talking about when we have just finished reading the Inquisition of the Savior concerning his love for him.
[time=1810] For certainly a man who would die in such a way must have loved the one for whom he died.
[time=1816] And yet at this particular time in his life the words of the Savior are like stinging arrows into his heart.
[time=1822] As three times he has asked, do you love me?
[time=1827] And the Scripture records with accuracy that the result of that inquisition of Peter was so stirring that his heart was grieved.
[time=1836] Last week in our message we looked at some of the theological aspects of this particular text.
[time=1842] We noticed the nuances of the Greek words for love and the differences in the answers and responses of Peter to the Lord and of the questions of our Lord to Peter.
[time=1854] And it would be easy for us to pass by this passage to the closing words of this chapter, having summarily dismissed this discussion concerning our love for the Lord.
[time=1864] But I believe that God would have us to take one more moment to look at it.
[time=1869] This time not as it refers to Peter and his love for Christ, but rather as it refers to us and our love for Christ.
[time=1878] In this passage of Scripture we have unfolded for us a new principle of serving the Lord.
[time=1884] We no longer see the response of a heart that is dominated by the law of the Scripture, but now we see the beginning of a heart that is to be dominated by the love of Christ.
[time=1895] So much as I have already said so, that ultimately he would die for his Savior.
[time=1901] The principle of love and service is the principle that ought to motivate us as we serve the Lord.
[time=1906] And as the Lord Jesus Christ three times directed his question to Peter and said to him, "Peter I want to ask you something, do you love me?"
[time=1915] And each time it was more difficult for Peter to respond until the Scripture says he was hurt, he was grieved.
[time=1923] Today I want to ask you that question. And I want by the Holy Spirit for that question to be directed to my heart.
[time=1930] David Jeremiah, do you love me?
[time=1935] Mr. and Mrs. Christian, whoever you are, do you love me?
[time=1941] And I'm going to ask that you consider this passage so directly applied to your own heart that it would be as if the Savior were to walk among the rows of this church this morning,
[time=1950] and come to stand in front of you and reach out his hand and put it on your shoulder, and look into your eyes and say, "I want to ask you something, do you love me?" And then having asked it once to ask it again the second and the third time, and then in your own heart knowing full well,
[time=1966] that since he knows what is in man, he knows what is in your heart.
[time=1970] I would ask that you listen carefully to these questions as they come home to your heart,
[time=1977] and as they become the source of examination of your service for the Lord.
[time=1981] It has always been a great encouragement to me as I've read this passage of Scripture to understand that our Lord provided for Peter,
[time=1988] an opportunity to make a threefold confession of his love, because Peter had three times denied the Lord.
[time=1996] That is a reminder to me that during this time of examination as we open our hearts to our Lord's question, that he is full of grace and mercy and anxious to take us wherever we are in our love for him and bring us to where we ought to be.
[time=2009] But the first and foremost step in that process for each and every one of us is to be examined in our own hearts as to whether or not we love him.
[time=2019] Today we must ask that question of ourselves. Ask it so intently that we ourselves may be grieved at the answer we must give.
[time=2027] And I aim to do that this morning with your understanding that as I ask it of you,
[time=2033] I have already and continue to ask it of myself.
[time=2038] Perhaps there would be some here today who would say, "Pastor, to whom should such a question be asked."
[time=2045] I mean, after all, we are the members of a good Bible-believing church.
[time=2049] We're the members of a good Bible-teaching soul-winning ministry.
[time=2052] We seek to honor the Lord. Is it legitimate for you to stand before us and question us concerning our love of Christ?
[time=2060] Unfortunately, there are many people who fill the chairs and the pews of our churches who go through the rituals and forms of worship who know nothing whatsoever about a love for Christ.
[time=2071] There are many who worship at the altar of a detailed doctrinal statement.
[time=2075] It can give you all of the sub points of what they believe, and they have a cold and dead orthodoxy without the love of Christ that should empower them in their service.
[time=2084] Someone has written that orthodoxy without love for Christ is just a casket in which we can bury religion.
[time=2090] I know many people who go about claiming to be religious folks who have all of the right answers and all of the right doctrines and perhaps have studied for many years,
[time=2099] but there's something missing in their life, and it's that love for the Savior which we are questioning today in our own lives.
[time=2107] There are people who believe in the importance of Sunday, but don't know how to love the Lord of the Sunday.
[time=2112] People who come to sit in the sanctuary of good churches, but don't know the High Priest, Jesus Christ, who ministers in that sanctuary and in the hearts of God's people.
[time=2122] There are people like the Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke when he told them that they were like white and sepulchres.
[time=2128] They went through the outward motions, but inside they were filled with dead men's bones.
[time=2133] Yes, I think that question ought to be asked to every religious person who hears my voice today, "Do you love Jesus?"
[time=2139] I didn't ask you what church you go to, or what denomination you belong to, or what your practices are religiously.
[time=2146] I've asked you the question that the Lord asked Peter, "Do you love Jesus Christ?" It's a question that ought to be directed to every religious person.
[time=2155] You say, "Pastor, I'm not only religious, but I'm zealous.
[time=2160] I'm a zealot for my faith, and my mind goes back to the New Testament record of the Apostle Paul,
[time=2166] who before he came to know and love Christ on the Damascus Road, set a record for zealous work and service to the Jewish community that has never since been equaled,
[time=2176] and yet he did not know the love of Christ." And I think also the life of Peter never was there an apostle like Peter with such zeal as Peter had.
[time=2186] Do you remember the occasion in the boat when the Lord walked to him on the water?
[time=2190] It wasn't Thomas or James or John that jumped out of the boat to walk to the Lord, it was Peter.
[time=2196] He was so zealous in wanting to be there first, and right here in the context that we've read in the 21st chapter,
[time=2202] when he knew that it was the Lord on the shore, who wasn't that jumped out of the boat to come to him?
[time=2207] It was Peter. It was Peter who said, "Lord, I will follow you with her so ever thou goest."
[time=2214] It was Peter who said, "Though others may deny you, Lord, I'll never do it." Peter was a zealot, and yet it was to this man at that time in his life that Jesus said, "Peter, I want to ask you, do you love me?"
[time=2229] I would speak to you who are Sunday school teachers and members of our boards and committees and those who work in all of the Sunday school
[time=2236] and church school and all of the organizations of the church, our choir members and all of you.
[time=2242] You can be zealous for the Lord even as zealous as Peter was and miss the point of the Christian life and the point of motivation and service.
[time=2250] And Christ would come to you today, whatever you may be doing, and however zealous you may be doing it and say to you, "This question, do you love me?"
[time=2257] And he's not asking you if you love what you do for him. He's not asking you if you love the job that you have for him.
[time=2263] He's asking you, "Do you love him?" He comes to me as the pastor of this church, and he says to me, "Do you love me?"
[time=2270] "Not do you love the church you pastor, not do you love the job you have, not do you love the excitement of the ministry, but do you love me?"
[time=2277] That's the key, and that's the question. And no matter how zealous we may be, we need to understand that there is a zeal that can be fed by the
[time=2286] regard of opinions of others. There is a zeal that can drive us to do all kinds of things because we are anxious for people to approve of us.
[time=2295] There is a zeal which is burned in the hearts of many people who are doing what they do out of their love for recognition instead of out of their love for the Lord.
[time=2306] And the Bible says that if we serve God like that, we are nothing more than sounding brass and tinkling cymbal. And so I say to you who are zealous for the Lord, you may be the most active people in this church.
[time=2317] Or in any other church, you may be on fire for God from all outward aspects, but the question is, "Do you love Jesus Christ?"
[time=2325] Some of you may say to me, "Pastor, I'm not only religious and zealous, but I practice great self-denial in my own life, almost to the point of being a hermit.
[time=2338] I am a non-conformist. I live a holy and righteous life for the Lord." You know, Peter said, "Lord, we have left all and followed thee, and may not have been much that he left when he said that, but it was all that he had.
[time=2351] He was one who knew on something about self-denial, and yet it was to Peter that Christ said, "Do you love me?"
[time=2358] Peter was abused and ridiculed and reproached for what he did.
[time=2362] He spent time in prison. He actually went to his death and martyred him. He sacrificed for Christ, and yet it was to Peter that Christ said, "Do you love me?"
[time=2371] There are many people around today who tell us that it is what we abstain from and what we don't do, that determines our love for the Lord.
[time=2380] And God knows that the book is filled with things we ought not to do and things from which we should abstain.
[time=2386] But the key to the service of Jesus Christ is not even our outward conformity to principles and our outward determination not to do or to do certain things.
[time=2396] The key is, "Do we love Jesus Christ?" You may be a student of the Word, spending many hours studying the Scripture, but I say to you, student of the Word, "Do you love Jesus Christ?"
[time=2409] Have you looked beyond the pages of this book to the one about whom the book writes?
[time=2414] It is good to know, but it is better to love.
[time=2418] There are many seminaries today that are filling the minds and the hearts of men with intellectual concerns, and they're going out and knowing all of the truth, but there's something missing, and that which is missing is a burning heart for Jesus Christ, and for the passion of Jesus Christ for a lost world.
[time=2435] You can be a student of the Word, you can be one who knows all of the principles of the book, but if you don't know and love Jesus Christ, you're missing the core of what it means to be a servant.
[time=2445] And so I say to you, student of the Word, "Do you love him? Do you love Jesus Christ?"
[time=2451] I think of Peter and all that he did in his life, he walked on the water, he preached the gospel, even was victorious over demons as he walked about serving God.
[time=2462] He was the one in this chapter who pulled the great net of fishes to the shore when the others could not, and yet it was to Peter that the Lord said, "Peter, I want to ask you a question, do you love me?"
[time=2475] Some of you here who are religious, zealous, some who are filled with the principles of separation and great self-denial, but the question is not any of those things.
[time=2486] The question is, "Do you love Jesus Christ?" I'd also like to share with you that those who may be privileged with the greatest of honors need to hear that question.
[time=2497] Do you know that Peter was one of three of Christ's favorite disciples? Peter, James, and John were chosen by Christ to witness some of his secret miracles.
[time=2506] It was Peter, James, and John that went to the Mount of Transfiguration with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2511] It was those same three disciples who stood at the outskirts of the Garden of Gethsemane while our Lord wrestled in his own soul with that which faced him in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=2521] Peter, James, and John, the privileged of the disciples, and yet having experienced all of those things, Jesus pointed his finger at Peter and he said, "Peter, I'm not interested in your privileges or your places of responsibility or all of the honors that have been bestowed upon you."
[time=2536] The question, "Peter, is this, do you love me?" That's the question.
[time=2542] It's possible for us to be elevated to places of service in a great church like the Black Hawk Baptist Church, to be in positions of honor, positions of responsibility, to be members of the staff and teaching in the school, and working in the Sunday school, and going out representing the church in evangelism, and do all of those things, have all of those wonderful privileges, but to be cold in our hearts toward the Lord Jesus Christ, and if that is true, we will never stand the test of continuing service.
[time=2570] And the last book of the New Testament is the Apostle John writing from the Isle of Patmos penned the letters to the churches.
[time=2577] He wrote to the church at Ephesus these words. He said, "I have somewhat against you because you have lost your first love. You have left your first love." What did he mean?
[time=2588] He meant that there was a time in that church filled with the Ephesian believers when they burned heart and their relationship for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2596] Their heart reached out to him, and there was personal devotion, and all that they did was a response to their love for Christ.
[time=2603] But over the days of their experience with Christ, that love began to wax cold, and now they were going through the outward motions, but they had lost their first love.
[time=2613] Some of you here are like that. I remember when you came to Christ.
[time=2617] When you first came to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you could talk of nothing more nor less than your love for Jesus Christ.
[time=2624] Everything was about him. Everything seemed to be radiated back to him, but over the days things have crept into your life.
[time=2631] And now that love for Christ has been replaced with all of the outward practices and involvements in the church.
[time=2638] And you know it's missing, and you know it's wrong.
[time=2641] And Christ comes to you and puts his hand upon your shoulder today, and he says, "I want to ask you a question. Do you love me? Do you love me?"
[time=2652] Peter was an apostle. Not the least of the apostles. Peter could have said to have been a soldier representing the Lord.
[time=2661] He was all of these things, but the Lord knew the coldness of his heart, and he touched him at the area of his love.
[time=2670] In our society today and in our churches, across Christendom in the United States, there are many who are respected as great soldiers of the truth.
[time=2682] God knows we need them, blazing out the trails of doctrine and standing true and reacting against the inroads of cults and isms that would come in and destroy the purity of our faith.
[time=2694] May I say to you today, you can be the greatest soldier for the Lord Jesus Christ and not have a love for Christ.
[time=2700] You can know how to defeat all of the attacks upon the gospel in the Word of God and be known as a champion of the faith, but not have a warm heart toward Christ and not love him.
[time=2711] There are some today who consider that there are superstars in the faith. We have a lot of that in our churches these days.
[time=2723] You can be recognized as a great Christian. It seems strange to me that most of the great Christians are great for what they did before they got saved and for what they did after they got saved.
[time=2733] I just happened to think about that this week. You can be a great Christian quote unquote and not have a burning heart for the Lord.
[time=2741] However important you may be in your church. However distinguished you may be in your service.
[time=2749] However much you may have suffered for the Lord. Don't evade this question.
[time=2755] "Love us thou me." Answer him humbly honestly boldly. Be as honest as was Peter who used a word of lesser degree so that he could at least somewhat honestly respond to the question of his Lord.
[time=2769] But listen to the question and hear it and answer it in your own heart today.
[time=2774] Will you remind yourself that he is not asking you if you love his church or if you love his people or if you love his work or even if you love his word is important as all of those things are.
[time=2784] He's asking you if you love him in personal devotion and if he is the most important person in your life.
[time=2793] The principle of service is all wrapped up in that question. There's not a problem we have in our churches in personnel.
[time=2801] Not a problem of personal jealousy or hurt feelings in serving the Lord that would not be solved if we got right back to the main motivation of serving.
[time=2810] Why is it that you do what you do because of a claim or because you're in a place of prominence if you do it because you love the Lord Jesus Christ you'll never be hurt.
[time=2820] You'll never be hurt if you do it because other people are saying how well you do it when they fail to say that any longer you'll be hurt.
[time=2829] But if you do it and you pour out your life and service to the Lord Jesus Christ because you've said Lord yes I love you and I want to give my life to you.
[time=2837] There will be a long and joyous experience in serving him.
[time=2843] How in the passage after the Lord Jesus Christ had inquired of Peter concerning his love.
[time=2851] He not only gave him a principle for service but he offered him a program for service.
[time=2856] You know what the program for serving God is. It's very simple. It's helping others in God's family.
[time=2863] Three times the Lord asked the question of Peter do you love me and you know three times when he answered no matter what the answer was.
[time=2870] He said Peter feed my sheep, tend my lambs, shepherd my sheep. What did he mean?
[time=2877] He meant simply this Peter if you say that you love me and you do and today if we say together that we love the Lord
[time=2885] and I hope we can say that to some degree in our hearts.
[time=2888] It means nothing to say it if having said it doesn't work out itself in the work that we do in reaching out to others.
[time=2896] The lambs and the sheep and the adult lambs represented the flock of God, God's family.
[time=2902] And God was saying through Christ to Peter Peter if you love me then you will show that you love me by ministering in my family
[time=2909] and caring for the lost sheep and teaching and feeding and caring for those who are a part of my flock.
[time=2915] It's so easy for us to sit smugly in our chairs on Sunday and lift our hearts to the Lord and sing "My Jesus I love thee"
[time=2922] and then when someone asks us to get involved in helping to serve him in the body of believers and reaching out to others with what God isn't trusted to us.
[time=2930] We say yes I appreciate you asking but I don't have time.
[time=2934] There is no such thing as a love that does not reach out. Love demands expression.
[time=2940] It cannot stay pent up and if we love the Lord Jesus Christ we will respond as Peter was told to respond by reaching out to the family around us.
[time=2949] Love demands expression.
[time=2953] What a difference it makes when having come to know Jesus Christ and having come to love him.
[time=2960] Because of our love for him we just want to overflow to everybody around us.
[time=2964] I see that once in a while and I tell you something it's real. It's genuine.
[time=2968] It's the real disease.
[time=2970] I want to ask you this morning this second question.
[time=2974] If you love Jesus Christ what are you doing to prove it?
[time=2979] You know several times in the New Testament we're told to prove our love.
[time=2984] How many of you men having married your childhood sweetheart and now having been married to her for five or ten years?
[time=2994] Could ever get by with just saying I want you to understand dear that I love you.
[time=3001] It's deeply in my heart that I love you but I'm not going to help you around here.
[time=3010] You've got your responsibility and don't bother me with it and I'm going to live my own life.
[time=3015] I want you to know I love you but I don't plan to do anything to prove it.
[time=3020] Every day and every way as we live together with those that we love we are demonstrating our love.
[time=3025] We're making personal sacrifices because we love each other.
[time=3029] We're not doing some of the things that we want to do because we know that in not doing that we're going to be ministering to the life of the person we love.
[time=3036] And the same thing is true with our relationship to Jesus Christ.
[time=3040] How can we go on saying we love him if we don't feed his sheep, if we don't reach out to those around us?
[time=3046] How can those of you who hear this message today who don't do anything to serve the Lord Jesus Christ even weakly say I love you?
[time=3056] My Bible says that when you love somebody you express that love.
[time=3062] There's a tremendous phenomenon taking place in Christianity today.
[time=3066] All over the place people are getting together for seminars.
[time=3070] Growth groups.
[time=3072] Study groups.
[time=3074] Increase knowledge.
[time=3076] Conferences.
[time=3078] And the published reports of those meetings fill up almost all of the Christian magazines.
[time=3083] And certainly I'm not opposed to them. I participate in them on occasion.
[time=3088] What the question I would ask is this, if these groups and these seminars and these conferences and these meetings and these workshops are teaching us to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=3100] could we not expect as the natural outgrowth of such an endeavor that there would be a wide sweeping movement among God's people to reach out to those around them and minister to them and feed the sheep and tend the sheep and shepherd the sheep?
[time=3115] I don't see that happening.
[time=3117] We go and sit and soak and we get all of the information and we collect all of the knowledge and it's just like we were seated at a table filled with beautiful morsels of food,
[time=3128] steak and all of the delicacies of life and we publish the report of our delicious meal to those who are starving down in Haiti.
[time=3135] We say oh what a wonderful meal we have.
[time=3138] Listen my Bible says if I love the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not going to soak that love up on myself but because I love him I will reflect that among God's people.
[time=3147] And I will reach out to others around me and I will minister to them in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3153] The question is do you love him?
[time=3157] And the second question like to the first is what are you doing to prove it?
[time=3162] When Paul wrote to the Corinthians in the 8th chapter of 2 Corinthians he told them to prove the sincerity of their love by participating in an offering that was being collected for those who were needy.
[time=3173] In 2 Corinthians 514 Paul wrote that the love of Christ constrained him in his witnessing.
[time=3181] I know there are some who say that was the love Christ had for him but it was certainly the love Paul had for Christ too.
[time=3188] Throughout the Bible we're told that all we do is to be motivated out of heart of love.
[time=3193] I was talking with Pastor Kruger the other day about the passages of Scripture that deal with singing.
[time=3198] We were sharing together that even in the musical ministry the Bible teaches us that we are to sing with grace in our hearts to the Lord reflecting to him our love.
[time=3212] It's a terrible thing to become a calloused cold Christian. I'm speaking to some today I'm sure it would be unusual if there weren't some here.
[time=3221] There was a day in your life when you would never miss a time of fellowship with him and with his people.
[time=3226] You're a Christian now but there's not that warmth and that relationship with Christ that there ought to be.
[time=3232] You're excited about his work perhaps and about what's going on in the church but your excitement no longer is centered on the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3239] You don't spend any time with him in fellowship and your heart is cold toward him and the Lord has said to you today from his word.
[time=3245] Do you love me and you've had to answer honestly Lord? I know I should but I don't.
[time=3254] You can't serve him. You can't minister for him. You can't reach out to others unless first of all you fall in love with him again.
[time=3262] And I'm praying that there will be a great sweeping of the Spirit of God in our hearts in this congregation of love for Jesus Christ that will be reflected as we reach out to those around us and let that love spill out of our hearts into their lives.
[time=3275] That's the way God would have it to be.
[time=3277] Someone has written that when the Lord Jesus Christ comes back the next time the only two things that he will take from this earth are his word and his people.
[time=3291] And if we love the Lord we will invest our time in those two areas but the principle has to come before the program.
[time=3301] If you're trying to serve God today out of false direction, misguided motivation, let me tell you that you need to go back and fall in love with Jesus Christ again and renew your relationship to him and then begin to serve him in a new and different way.
[time=3320] Shall we pray?
[time=3325] Our Father let us tell us in the word about one whom having not seen we love.
[time=3331] And even though we have not seen him with our physical eyes we see him spiritually in the pages of this book.
[time=3337] And we ask that in a wonderful renewing of our hearts and minds you will cause us to love him.
[time=3345] With our heads bowed and our eyes closed let me just say this before we bid goodbye to those who have joined us this morning.
[time=3353] If you don't love the Lord Jesus Christ and you've never accepted him as your savior you can do it now.
[time=3359] Just invite him to come into your heart ask him to forgive your sin and receive him as the savior of your life and pray and he will come in.
[time=3370] Father we pray that many...
