[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=19] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=38] >> Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=41] >> A man sat in my office some weeks ago and said to me,
[time=51] "Pastor, I have been a Christian for many years,
[time=58] but what I have done has totally estranged me from God, and there is no hope of my ever coming back into fellowship with him.
[time=66] He then shared with me the events of a tragic life of rejection and of sin, failure to follow God's will
[time=77] in his own life, and ultimately the collapse of his own home, despair for his own living.
[time=85] He was fully convinced that he had sinned away the day of grace in his life, and that God would never receive him back.
[time=91] What a joy it was to open the Scripture and share with him that there is no such thing in the Word of God, at least, from human perspective of being so far from God that one cannot be reclaimed.
[time=106] The joy of a study of the Word of God today is found in the life of a man who rejected, denied, cursed, and betrayed his Lord,
[time=117] but who ultimately found his way back into fellowship and became one of God's great men for the founding of churches all over Asia Minor.
[time=129] What God did for that man, he's anxious to do for any man, and I believe the Word of God has a message of great hope for many who may hear my voice today.
[time=141] The Christian gospel is a message of hope, a message of great rejoicing and excitement, a message of enthusiasm because of what God has done in his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, for each of us.
[time=153] That's the theme of our choir as they sing for us a great anthem of praise, let us all praise God and sing.
[time=171] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=297] - Thank you, choir, for that anthem of praise,
[time=305] for bringing us to the reminder again of the purpose for which we have met here, to praise the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=313] I don't know if we're going to be able to accomplish this for those who are watching at home, but I never like to have people visiting us who are part of our extended team without recognizing them, and in the balcony is one of our staff members extended out from this church to parts all over the place.
[time=330] And I saw her last night at a party and told her that she wouldn't be able to come to church without being recognized, and she said she had made the fatal mistake of letting me know ahead of time.
[time=340] But I know that you all know and love Nell Collins and the ministry that God is giving her as she reaches out to touch the lives of people who have been found with cancer.
[time=351] Nell herself is a cancer patient, and God has given her the rich ministry of touching the lives of other people who have cancer.
[time=359] And we shared last night an exciting new film that has been prepared to be used as a tool in her ministry, and I'd like for her to stand so that we can all see her.
[time=368] Those of you from Blackhawk will want to do your best to welcome her and let her know that you're praying for during these days.
[time=375] She shared with us last night that she goes back into the hospital tomorrow for her annual visit to check up and report, and so we're just praying that God will give her a good time of rest and a positive report that will give her great opportunity to minister to
[time=390] ever many more people in the days ahead.
[time=392] And we have scheduled the film sometime soon for you all to see.
[time=396] It's a powerful tool that God is going to use in the lives of many people.
[time=400] Now we're going to listen to the ministry of our Blackhawk singers, and they're singing one of my favorite songs that's a part of their repertoire, features the music of their voices combined in a special solo by Dave Miller.
[time=414] Everything is entitled, "The Earth Will Sing", listen now as they minister to us.
[time=439] When Jesus comes to ring in glory, the Earth will sing, "Rehebs and Story", "The
[time=459] Earth Will Sing", "The Earth Will Sing", "The Earth Will Sing", and "The Earth Will Sing,
[time=459] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 112 seconds] Earth Will Sing", "The Earth Will Sing", "The Earth Will Sing", and "The Earth Will Sing,...
[time=587] Sing" Thank you so much for sharing the Bible our with us today and for giving us this opportunity
[time=601] while we're receiving the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to talk with you about the things that pertain to those of you who are part of our extended audience there at home.
[time=610] I want to take this opportunity at the beginning of our time together to express my appreciation, especially to a very wonderful group of people who make up the Founders Club of the Bible Our Ministry.
[time=622] It is crucial for us to have those people standing with us week in and week out and they are the ones who are the backbone of this ministry.
[time=629] If you're a member of the Founders Club, my heart is extended to you today with sincere appreciation.
[time=636] Continue to pray and be faithful in your giving God is using you in a wonderful way to reach out to many.
[time=642] Donna, during this time we have the privilege of sharing something that's special for our friends at home and I'm pretty excited about this month's gift offer and I know you are too.
[time=653] Why don't you introduce it to them again?
[time=655] As we've said many times before, we're concerned about putting something into your home that's going to be helpful to you.
[time=660] We don't want to send you a trinket or a gadget that you're never going to use but we want to give you something that's meaningful in your life and perhaps the one need that has come through to us time and time again is the need for help in Bible study.
[time=674] All of us realize the need to study the Bible and many of us need a tool to help us and the
[time=680] tool that we'd like to make available to you this month is a book entitled "4,000 Questions and Answers to the Bible." And this book, which I have in my hand right now, is what we'd like to send to you so that you can help yourself study the Word of God.
[time=696] The book is filled with questions and answers on the passages of Scripture that you'll be studying and in the back there's just a wealth of extra material to help you get into the Word and to deal with those subjects that are most important to you as you work your way through the Bible.
[time=710] One of the things that people often ask me is they see my Bibles, which you're marked up with red and blue and underlined and highlighted.
[time=717] How do you know how to mark your Bible?
[time=719] Well, I suppose there's no perfect method but there are some ways that you can mark your Bible meaningfully and this book has a special section on how to mark the Bible.
[time=729] There are some other things that are pretty exciting too.
[time=731] There are a number of little paragraphs in the back of the book that specialize on different things.
[time=736] There's one small section on the history of the Bible and then as you go through in the back there are also recommended passages for you to memorize as you're reading through particular books of the Bible.
[time=747] They have a number of verses in each book that they suggest that you memorize.
[time=752] I believe every person who studies the Scripture ought to have this in their reference library and it's small enough that you can carry it with you when you go to Sunday school and church or wherever you go you can stick it in your briefcase men as you go out of town to go on a business trip and have it available as you study the Scripture.
[time=766] We'd like to send it to you free this week and the way we do that is by asking you first of all to get in touch with us and request it and Donna, there's a couple of ways we do that one of which you're most familiar with.
[time=778] We have established a toll-free number which you may call at any time in the day and night anytime during the week and that number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=789] You ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would like the book 4,000 questions
[time=795] and answers on the Bible.
[time=797] That number to call again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=803] And will you do it now because if you wait first of all you'll misplace the number and then you'll forget to do it.
[time=809] You've made it as easy as possible for you because it is our sincere desire to put this book in your home, but obviously we can't do it unless we hear from you.
[time=817] So go to the phone dial 1-800-247-2160 and ask for the book of Bible study called 4,000
[time=826] question and answers on the Bible.
[time=828] And we'll receive your name and address the next day and send this booklet into your home this next week.
[time=834] We've mailed out hundreds of these books in just the last few days.
[time=838] What a joy it is to know that because you care enough to call, we're able to extend our ministry into your home and some way affect your study of the Bible every day during the week.
[time=848] And of course, calling isn't the only way.
[time=851] You may also write to us if you prefer, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250-Fort
[time=859] Wayne, Indiana.
[time=861] The zip code is 46815 and we do love to hear from you in the mail.
[time=866] The one advantage of letters over the phone is that you can send to us a special message of prayer concern or perhaps a word of appreciation for some particular ministry that the Bible hours had in your own home and family.
[time=878] So it is important for us to hear from you through the mail.
[time=880] If you have time this week, we'd like for you to sit down and write us a letter.
[time=883] But most important at all is that you call us or write us and let us know that you're watching, listening, sharing in this ministry and let us have the privilege of sending this booklet to you free this week.
[time=894] Before we go back to the morning service, I want to remind you that your prayer is especially important to us during these days.
[time=900] In just a few days, we will begin a massive outreach to increase the number of our Founders Club members and we're counting on all of you to pray with us as we begin that outreach ministry.
[time=911] Once again, if you'd like to have this booklet, we're asking you to call 1-800-247-2160.
[time=918] Please stay with us as we open the Scripture in just a few moments to deal with an exciting subject, one that I believe is going to have life-changing perspective for many of you as well as for those here in the auditorium.
[time=929] The story of the restoration of the Apostle Peter, one who denied Christ, but who found
[time=935] his way back into the fellowship of the Lord in a wonderful way.
[time=938] I trust you'll have the opportunity to be with us as we open the Scripture and share that passage together.
[time=972] Thank you.
[time=1002] I invite you to take your hymnals now and we're turning in them to hymn number 18.
[time=1012] We're going to stand together and sing "All Hail the Power of Jesus Name."
[time=1018] It's hymn number 18, and shall we stand together now as we sing.
[time=1024] They're in place together.
[time=1054] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1066] It was a few years ago that I first heard the song that's entitled "The Lighthouse." It's the song that Ron Hackett, our tenor soloist is going to sing for us in just a minute.
[time=1077] I sat very intently and listened to the words of this.
[time=1080] As a chalk artist, I draw a picture of a lighthouse that stands on a shore with a ship that's
[time=1086] shipwrecked at the rocks below, and this song is an ideal song to depict what happens
[time=1093] in a believer's life, all of us on the sea of sin.
[time=1097] But then we look to the light on the shore.
[time=1100] It's the light Jesus Christ, the light of the world, and then we come to know safety.
[time=1106] We know Him as a haven, as a harbor, and then He becomes the lighthouse.
[time=1112] Not a one of us who are saved this morning will not be able to sing with Ron.
[time=1118] I thank God for the lighthouse.
[time=1136] There's a lighthouse on the hillside that overlooks life's sea,
[time=1148] where I'm tossed its sins out of light that I might see.
[time=1161] And the light that shines in a darkness will safely leave the old.
[time=1173] If it weren't for the lighthouse, my ship would be the world.
[time=1187] And I thank God for the lighthouse.
[time=1196] I owe my life to Him, for Jesus is the lighthouse, and from the rocks of sea,
[time=1214] He has shown the light around me that I can plainly see.
[time=1227] If it wasn't for that lighthouse, where would my ship be?
[time=1239] Everybody that lives around me says tear that lighthouse down.
[time=1252] The big ships, they don't sail by here anymore.
[time=1258] There's no use, it's standing round, then my mind goes back to that stormy night.
[time=1271] When just in time I saw the light, yes, that light from that old lighthouse
[time=1284] that stands up there on the hill.
[time=1291] And I thank God for the lighthouse.
[time=1299] I owe my life to Him, for Jesus is the lighthouse,
[time=1312] and from the rocks of sea, He has shown the light around me
[time=1325] that I can clearly see, or if it wasn't for the lighthouse, where would this ship be?
[time=1343] He has shown the light around you, so that you could plainly see.
[time=1356] If it wasn't for the lighthouse, where would your ship be?
[time=1377] Thank you Ron.
[time=1385] That's what we aim to be as a church, a lighthouse to show the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=1391] into the lives of people.
[time=1394] As a beacon that shines beyond just the walls of this church and out into communities all around, and we trust that God will continue to enable us to be a bright light that will illumine the way of those who are seeking for guidance and direction.
[time=1409] I want you this morning, as we begin our study of the Word of God, to open your Bibles
[time=1416] first of all to the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Matthew.
[time=1421] We will conclude in the twenty-first chapter of the book of John, but we must begin here.
[time=1429] Matthew chapter 16.
[time=1437] Now may we pray together before we study the Word.
[time=1441] Our Father, our Bibles are open, I trust that our hearts are open, our minds are open.
[time=1453] We come today to this life of a man who illustrates for us the capacity of the best men to do
[time=1463] the worst things, the capacity of a great God to welcome back into fellowship those who
[time=1471] have gone about as far as one could dream.
[time=1476] We do not treat these passages lightly, but we recognize on the one hand the danger of
[time=1482] communicating in the doctrine of the grace of God, an easy believerism which allows people
[time=1491] to live as they choose without any concern whatsoever to the holiness of the Lord.
[time=1497] On the other hand, we could communicate the terrible sin of Peter to such a degree that we forget about the love of God.
[time=1505] We are mindful of the fact that all air in our understanding of our Father in Heaven is an air of a lack of proper tension between God's love and His holiness, and we want to be
[time=1517] so faithful to those two great attributes today.
[time=1521] Here for those who have strayed from thee, we would pray that somehow today they will
[time=1528] be drawn again into the fold of fellowship.
[time=1531] We pray our Father that if there are those among us or those who hear my voice who are teetering on the edge of walking away from thee, perhaps to engage in some sin that would
[time=1542] ruin their testimony, that you would preserve them from that.
[time=1548] We need your guidance and direction as we move through these many passages to see clearly the life, the downfall, and the restoration of the man, Peter, that we may learn from his experience and apply those lessons to our own lives.
[time=1563] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1568] As you know, we have been struggling trying to get through John 21, and every time we try to take a straight course to the end, we end up going on some excursion, which excursions
[time=1580] I hope will help us to better understand the truth that God has for us in this chapter.
[time=1587] We have followed the thought and theme of the 21st chapter of the book of John through the experience of the disciples on a lonely night of fishing in which they caught nothing.
[time=1596] We have listened carefully as our Lord has commanded them to cast the net on the other side, and we have seen that in response to their obedience, a great draft of fish was
[time=1606] brought to the shore.
[time=1608] And now as he moves from his attention of the disciples to his personal encounter with Peter, we have walked through these verses and watched as our Lord carefully interrogated the apostle to bring out of him a confession threefold of his faith and love for the Lord
[time=1624] Jesus Christ.
[time=1626] The last part of John 21 is the recommissioning of Peter.
[time=1630] It is the tenderness of a Lord who loved him beyond anything human love can express, and
[time=1636] it cannot possibly be understood unless we create for it the context of Peter's denial
[time=1642] and fall from fellowship.
[time=1645] For the greatness of his sin is that which helps us to understand the greatness of the mercy and love of the Savior.
[time=1654] I have asked you to have your Bibles open to Matthew 16.
[time=1658] The downfall of Peter begins in this chapter, strange as it may seem, it also perhaps contains
[time=1665] the greatest moment in the life of the apostle Peter.
[time=1668] For here in Matthew 16 and in the 16th verse we have Peter's great confession of the deity
[time=1675] of Jesus Christ.
[time=1678] When he was asked by the Lord, who do you say that I am?
[time=1682] We read in Matthew 16 and verse 16, and Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[time=1689] the Son of the living God." Up until that time there had been no greater confession of the deity of Christ in that which that day came from the lips of Peter.
[time=1700] One would think that at that moment in time he had risen to a level which would place him beyond reproach and beyond temptation, but we cannot finish the 16th chapter before
[time=1712] we have found Peter taking his first step downward in that long plunge that ultimately
[time=1718] took him to the very depths of degradation in his denial that he even knew the Christ.
[time=1726] The first step in his downfall is recorded in the 22nd verse of this 16th chapter.
[time=1731] When the Lord began to tell his disciples that he must go to the cross and explain to them the nature of his crucifixion and that he would soon come back from the grave and be resurrected.
[time=1742] As he began to explain this to the disciples, we read the words of Peter who had just confessed him as Lord in verse 22, "Then Peter took him and the nuances took him aside and said
[time=1753] to him and began to rebuke him, and said, 'Lord, be it far from thee, Lord, this shall
[time=1759] not be unto thee.' Peter now begins to rebuke the Lord whose deity he had previously confessed, and he says to the Lord, 'You will never go to the cross, and one cannot help but miss the sting in the words of our Savior as he responded to Peter and said, 'Get thee behind me, Satan,
[time=1779] without art and offense unto me, thou saver us not the things that are of God but those that are of men.' We could dwell long on Peter's determination that Christ should not go to the cross but
[time=1792] suffice it to say that his first step downward after his confession was that when he did
[time=1798] not understand the Lord's method, he withdrew his loyalty from him.
[time=1804] How often we do that as Christians, when we cannot comprehend what the Lord is doing, we forget that no matter what he is doing, we owe him our allegiance and our utmost obedience.
[time=1815] Peter took his first step away from the Lord when he questioned that which his Lord and Master had said unto him.
[time=1823] The next steps of his downfall are recorded in the 14th chapter of the book of Mark, and we can simply touch on them lightly, but I wish you would turn with me in your Bibles to Mark 14.
[time=1836] The next step of Peter's downfall and his separation from the Lord in fellowship is recorded in Mark 14 and verse 29.
[time=1847] In the context of the 14th chapter, the Lord Jesus Christ has just finished eating the
[time=1853] Passover Supper, the Lord's Supper with his disciples.
[time=1857] We read in verse 26 that when they had sung in him they went out to the Mount of Olives, and Jesus said unto them, "All ye shall be offended because of me this night, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered, but after I am raised up I will go before you unto Galilee, but Peter said unto him, although all should
[time=1878] be offended, yet will not I." The second step is signaled in Peter's brash claim to being above temptation.
[time=1890] He said, "Lord, though everyone else shall be offended to do that, you don't have to worry about me, I am above sin, I am above temptation," and we scarcely read this chapter till we come to the 47th verse, and we discover that though he had claimed to go to death
[time=1905] with Christ and claim to be filled with allegiance for Christ, he could not even watch with him in prayer for one hour, for we read in verse 37 that when the Lord had gone to pray he cometh and findeth them sleeping, and he saith unto Peter, "Simon, sleep us thou, couldest
[time=1921] thou not watch one hour?" May I say to you that one of the things that Satan uses to destroy us and to bring us down
[time=1930] to sin and reproach and defilement and offense to the brethren is to somehow get us in a place
[time=1937] where we think we are above reproach and where Satan cannot touch us.
[time=1943] In these past months we have had the unfortunate privilege of hearing news from about the country
[time=1951] of different men of God who have fallen into sin.
[time=1954] Not too long ago I asked a friend of mine who now is a close friend of one of those brethren.
[time=1960] What in his estimation had caused that man to fall into sin, and he said this to me.
[time=1965] He said he came to the place in his life and ministry where he was so respected and looked up to by men in every corner of this United States that somehow Satan tricked him into
[time=1976] believing that he could live above impunity.
[time=1981] And in his life he gradually fell into the feeling that he could do what others could not do and get by with it, and he fell into sin and his life and ministry was ruined until
[time=1991] God reclaimed him by his grace.
[time=1994] Peter said, "Lord, though all should offend you, you don't have to worry about me, and in the next moment he failed the Lord." Now often that's true in our own lives.
[time=2001] We take the next step downward.
[time=2003] And we notice in the 14th chapter of Mark and in the 47th verse, the Lord now being under
[time=2009] arrest by those who had come to get him in the garden.
[time=2012] And we read that in verse 47 that one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant
[time=2018] of the high priest and cut off his ear.
[time=2021] Now Mark was a friend of Peter, so he failed to mention his name, but the record is clear elsewhere that it was Peter who did that.
[time=2028] It was Peter who could not wait for the Lord to do his own work in his own way according to the ministry of the Spirit.
[time=2034] And now in his downward fall takes things into his own hands, and in the ministry of the flesh is going to do what God never told him to do in the first place.
[time=2043] One of the things that happens to a servant who begins to fall is that they begin to operate in the flesh without instructions from God, and they make mistakes, and they begin to wield a sword where the Lord doesn't want a sword to be wielded.
[time=2057] The next step in his downfall is recorded in the 54th verse of this chapter.
[time=2062] The scripture says that after this time in the garden that they brought Jesus Christ before the high priest in the Sanhedrin and the record goes like this, and they led Jesus away to the high priest, and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes, now underlined this in your Bible, and Peter followed him afar off.
[time=2083] The one who had been so close to him and triumphed for it of the disciples who had watched him in every exciting moment of his life.
[time=2090] Now the scripture says he is following the Lord afar off.
[time=2094] He is not close in his fellowship with the Lord.
[time=2096] He is allowed distance to grow between him and his Savior.
[time=2101] And then in the verses that close this chapter, we have the record of Peter's three denials.
[time=2109] We have mentioned them in previous sermons, and you know the record of how three times he was asked to be identified with the Savior, the Lord, and three times he denied that he knew him and ultimately in the last part of the chapter the scripture says that he swore and he said, "I don't know him.
[time=2125] I don't want anything to do with him.
[time=2127] I've never known him, don't associate me with Jesus Christ." And he denied the Lord that he loved.
[time=2134] From Matthew 16, 16 where he said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," to
[time=2140] Mark chapter 14 in the end of the chapter where he said, "I don't know him," and cursed him.
[time=2146] There is a long downward trend from the life of fellowship with the Lord, till the ultimate
[time=2152] denial of the Lord.
[time=2154] May I pause here long enough to say to you who listened to this message this morning,
[time=2161] Satan hasn't changed his strategy one eyeota.
[time=2164] No man falls from fellowship in their relationship with the Lord overnight.
[time=2169] No man goes to bed one night in Matthew 16, 16, and wakes up the next morning in Mark chapter
[time=2176] 14 verse 68.
[time=2178] There is that gradual washing away of fellowship and distance between a man's heart and the heart of the Savior until little by little Satan begins to work his way into the heart of that person until, as Christ said to Peter, "Satan hath filled thine heart."
[time=2194] It is a testimony to us, is it not, of the capacity of the best of men to do the worst
[time=2200] of things when any one of God's servants falls into sin or gets away from the Lord or begins
[time=2207] to live in a life that is not characteristically that of a Christian.
[time=2212] People will say, "Why, how could such a wonderful man do that?" Mark it down in your book, "There is not a person here in this auditorium or anywhere where this message is heard who is not capable of the very worst of sins and the very moment
[time=2226] that we come to recognize or to feel in our own hearts that we live above impunity, we have taken the first step downward." Peter fell because he was brash and confident and cocky in his relationship to the Lord.
[time=2241] And great and mighty was the fall of that man, but I want to share with you today not
[time=2249] the awfulness of his sin.
[time=2252] I think one of the greatest things about the life of Peter, one of the greatest studies that you will ever make in his life are the steps of recovery that our Lord took to bring
[time=2264] him back to himself.
[time=2265] And I just want to say this morning, I don't know where any of you are in your walk with the Lord.
[time=2270] Some of you may be far, far away.
[time=2272] Maybe you by your life and testimony have denied the Lord.
[time=2276] I want to share with you this morning that the Lord Jesus Christ is more anxious to have you back than you are to come back.
[time=2281] And even now he's beginning to work in your life those circumstances which will woo you back into his fellowship.
[time=2288] And if you will follow those of things in your own life that he's using to bring you back, he will bring you back to that place of fellowship and give you a life of ministry and service that will glorify him.
[time=2301] Let's trace our loving Lord's ministry to Peter.
[time=2305] First of all, let's turn in our Bibles to Luke chapter 22.
[time=2309] Luke chapter 22.
[time=2312] And I want us to read together there from verses 31 and 32.
[time=2318] As our Lord was foretelling the denial of Peter, he said these words to Peter.
[time=2324] And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may
[time=2331] sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.
[time=2339] And when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
[time=2345] I don't know if this grips your heart as it does mine.
[time=2349] Here is a man about to deny his Savior.
[time=2352] And the Lord said, "Peter, Satan has asked for you as he went before God in the Old Testament
[time=2358] and asked for the life of Job that he might test him.
[time=2361] Satan comes before Christ and he says, "I want Peter that I might sift him as wheat." And the Lord said, "Simon, Satan has asked for you, but I want you to know that I've asked for you." Satan's asked for you, "But I've prayed for you.
[time=2375] Simon, I've prayed for you that your faith fail not." Some of you say, "Pastor, the Lord Jesus Christ's prayer was not answered.
[time=2385] Did his faith not fail?" Oh no, his courage failed.
[time=2390] His obedience failed, his hope failed, his testimony failed, but his faith failed not.
[time=2396] That's what was restored to him through the ministry of Jesus Christ, tenderly wooing him back.
[time=2401] His faith failed not.
[time=2403] He walked away from the Lord, he was disobedient, he got out of fellowship, but his faith did not fail.
[time=2408] Jesus prayed that his faith would not fail.
[time=2411] I want to tell you this morning that one of the great things about where you are in your life if you're away from the Lord is that I can tell you on the basis of this scripture.
[time=2420] There is one in heaven who intercedes for you.
[time=2423] You may be far away from the Lord so that you cannot even consciously think of Christ in your own life, but there is one in heaven if you're a child of God who prays for you, who intercedes for you, who right now in your sin and your rebellion is praying to God that you will come back to him.
[time=2439] He's praying for you as he prayed for Peter.
[time=2442] The second step in our Savior's ministry to bring Peter back into fellowship is recorded in the same chapter.
[time=2449] We could miss it easily, but we must not.
[time=2454] We read after Peter's denial in verse 60, and Peter said, "Man, I know not what thou
[time=2460] sayest, and immediately while he spoke the cock crow," now listen, "and the Lord turned
[time=2467] and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto
[time=2473] him before the cock crows thou shalt deny me thrice." Oh, I've tried to imagine this week what was in that look from the Savior's eyes.
[time=2483] Here was his beloved disciple who three times in the knowledge of the Savior had said, "I don't know him added to the sorrow and grief of his crucifixion in the burden of sin that was on him from the world's transgressions, now one of his own had denied him and said three times, I don't know Christ." And as he said it the third time, the glance of the Savior caught the eyes of Peter and looked at him.
[time=2508] I wonder what was in that look.
[time=2511] You say perhaps it was an angry look.
[time=2514] Perhaps it was a look of disappointment.
[time=2519] I somehow feel that in the eyes of the Savior, Peter perceived the sorrow of his heart and the grief of the Savior's heart that one who so trusted in him had denied him.
[time=2531] I wonder if for just a moment in our sin and in our rebellion and in our failure to walk in fellowship with the Lord.
[time=2539] If we could just perceive of the fact that the Savior who died for us, the Savior who sacrificed his life for us looks at our lives through his eyes of love and compassion and
[time=2551] he sees our rejection and our rebellion.
[time=2556] Christ looked Peter back to himself.
[time=2559] He'll do that for you.
[time=2561] The third step in Peter's recovery is found over in the 16th chapter of the book of Mark.
[time=2569] And I want you to turn there because it's so important that you see these passages.
[time=2574] Mark chapter 16 and these passages of Scripture about the life of Peter put all together and
[time=2584] show us the tenderness of our Lord's compassionate heart for this way we're disciple.
[time=2590] It's a resurrection morning now and the women have gathered at the sepulcher and the Lord
[time=2596] Jesus Christ has risen and he comes now to speak to the women through the angel that
[time=2606] was at the tomb.
[time=2609] And we read in Mark chapter 16 in verse 7 that the angel said to the women, "But go your
[time=2617] way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee."
[time=2625] Now that doesn't have to be in the text.
[time=2629] Peter was one of the disciples, was he not?
[time=2632] But the Lord took special notice of Peter's condition and he said through the angel, "You go and tell the disciples and Peter that the Lord is resurrected."
[time=2642] I've wondered what it must have been like for Peter to have lived through the trial
[time=2648] and crucifixion of the Savior.
[time=2652] As he watched from afar the events of our Lord's trial and ultimately as he went to the cross and Peter stood afar off watching the crucifixion, as he felt in his own heart
[time=2662] the sting and remorse of the last words he had spoken in the earshot of his Savior and remembered
[time=2668] the awful denial that had been part of him.
[time=2671] And then Christ was taken from the cross and put in the tomb and the tomb was sealed.
[time=2676] And all through the week Peter walked back and forth remembering one thing, "I denied my Lord." The last word I spoke before he died was a word of denial.
[time=2687] Certainly I couldn't be clasped among the disciples anymore.
[time=2690] Certainly I'm not one of the beloved anymore.
[time=2693] Certainly I couldn't be one that Christ would have any interest in anymore and he was for the Lord and rejected and felt for certain that he had done the ultimate thing.
[time=2702] The Scripture declares that after he had denied the Lord he went out and he wept bitterly.
[time=2709] What a terrible thing it is for a person to say a word of bitterness and hate and denial
[time=2718] and let that be the last words that a loved one hears.
[time=2724] Truth before you came to church this morning you had bitter words with somebody you love.
[time=2728] You have to get that straightened out.
[time=2732] What a terrible thing if somebody you loved should go out of this life and you would have to live with a reminder in your heart that the last words you spoke were words of anger and bitterness and denial.
[time=2745] The Lord Jesus Christ ministered to Peter in that regard.
[time=2749] He knew what was in Peter's heart.
[time=2751] He knew that Peter was hurting and that Peter would feel left out that he didn't belong because of what he'd done and so he said to the angel you tell those women to go back there and tell the disciples that I'm risen and you make a special effort to tell Peter
[time=2765] because if you don't he won't feel like he's been forgiven.
[time=2770] The next step of our Lord's restoration is found in the fact that he appeared to Peter
[time=2783] individually.
[time=2785] Wish I had time to take you to 1 Corinthians 15 and then back again to the to the Gospels and show you that though we don't often talk about this as one of the main appearances that the Lord made after his resurrection do you know that the Scripture says that Christ appeared specifically to Peter.
[time=2803] Paul says he appeared also unto Cephas Peter.
[time=2807] All of the disciples together he appeared there and to the 500 gathered at one time and to the women and to the two on the road to Emmaus but a special appearance to Peter.
[time=2817] I don't know what happened there are no words there are no descriptions of where it took place or how but somehow I can't help but imagine that the Lord took a special interest to go to Peter and say now Peter I know what you did and I know that you know what you
[time=2831] did.
[time=2832] I know how you feel about that now Peter you didn't want me to go to the cross you said
[time=2838] far be it from the Lord but I've been there Peter and I died there Peter and I forgave
[time=2844] your sins and pay the penalty for your sin and I've come back specifically to communicate to you in a one-on-one situation that you're still one of my special people and I love you.
[time=2856] And I know that God does that through the instrumentation of His word through some other
[time=2863] person.
[time=2864] He comes to speak to us about our sin and to bring compassion to our heart no matter
[time=2870] what we've done in the 21st chapter of the book of John where we started we conclude
[time=2883] here in John 21 are the last few steps of our Lord's recovery of Peter.
[time=2891] We have spent two weeks talking about His challenge of Peter's love.
[time=2895] Three times he asks him Peter do you love me?
[time=2899] Three times Peter skirts the issue.
[time=2906] I wonder if you've noticed how in the 21st chapter of John the Lord ministered to Peter just in the situation.
[time=2915] I couldn't help but think that the very place where this all took place must have been a powerful tool for the restoration of Peter.
[time=2922] The entire plot was designed to awaken Peter's conscience and open eyes.
[time=2927] The catch of fish that had happened that night reminded him of that first time when
[time=2933] he had said that he would forsake all and follow the Lord back in Luke 5.
[time=2938] The fire of coals that the Lord prepared on the shore must have been a visual reminder to Peter's mind that there was another time when he stood and warmed himself at the enemy's fire.
[time=2947] He couldn't help but made that association.
[time=2951] The location at the Sea of Galilee, the very place where it all took place caused a flood of memories to come back through the mind of Peter.
[time=2959] It was here that the Lord Jesus Christ had fed the 5,000.
[time=2963] It was here that Peter had made his attempt to walk on the water to his Savior.
[time=2968] It was here that he had gone to catch the fish with the coin in its mouth.
[time=2973] It was here that he had been present when the storm had been stilled.
[time=2976] Peter looked around him at the surroundings that day in Galilee and all of these things
[time=2982] came back to him to remind him of what he had been before he had denied the Lord.
[time=2987] I believe Jesus caused that to happen.
[time=2990] I believe he set that up.
[time=2991] He made those circumstances what they were.
[time=2994] How many times have we been in places where God at former times has spoken to us?
[time=3000] One of the reasons why we think it's good for Christians when they're out of fellowship with the Lord to come back to the altar and get things right is because it brings them back to the place where they gave their heart to Christ and causes them to renew their commitment and brings them to that familiar surrounding where they once knew that fellowship with the Lord.
[time=3017] How many times have you gone back to some camp or some retreat where you made a commitment to the Lord and just by being in the surroundings have been reminded that God at that point in time in your life had done some special thing for you.
[time=3031] That's what was happening in Peter's mind and in his heart.
[time=3035] You can see him coming back to the Savior as he's drawn by these powerful things that are going on around him.
[time=3041] And then will you notice in verse 22 that the Lord recommissioned him?
[time=3047] Way back in Luke 5 when he had been called from the fishing nets the Lord had said to him, "Peter, from now on you'll catch men." And the Scripture says that Peter forsook all and he followed the Lord.
[time=3059] He wanted to follow him, but you know there are a number of passages of Scripture that talk about his struggle with following.
[time=3067] There was a time in Luke chapter 22 verses 33 and 34 when Peter said, "Lord, I'm ready
[time=3074] to follow you to prison and to death," and the Lord said, "Peter, tonight, three times you're going to deny me." Peter said, "I want to follow you, Lord," and the Lord said, "No, you're not ready, Peter.
[time=3084] You really don't know what you're talking about.
[time=3087] You read on in the story of the Lord's dealing with his disciples in John chapter 13 after
[time=3095] the washing of the disciples' feet and the Scripture records that Simon Peter said unto him, "Lord, where go us now?" And Jesus answered him and said, "Peter, where I go, you cannot follow me now, but you shall follow me afterwards." And Peter said, "Lord, why cannot I follow thee?" The Lord said, "Peter, before this night's over, you're going to deny me three times.
[time=3115] You're not ready to follow me.
[time=3116] You don't know what following me is all about." And then John 15 verses 18 and 19 in the story of the arrest and trial, John tells us that
[time=3129] Peter pretended to follow the Lord.
[time=3131] He followed him right up to the gate of the trial, but the Scripture says he stood way at the back at the door.
[time=3136] He didn't want to get too close.
[time=3137] He didn't follow him as long as it didn't cost him anything, but he didn't want to get too close.
[time=3144] But the Lord had said to Peter back in his earlier days that he was not ready to follow him and could not follow him.
[time=3149] Now in John 21, he says, "Simon Peter, follow me."
[time=3155] Verse 22, "Jesus saith unto him, if I will, that he teary till I come, what is that to the follow thou me?" Peter didn't understand all that was meant in that next prophecy that the Lord gave in John 21.
[time=3169] The Lord said, "Peter, when you were young, you did what you pleased.
[time=3172] You moved about as you would.
[time=3174] You had freedom.
[time=3175] You could do what you want.
[time=3176] But when you get old, another she'll stretch forth thy hands and bind thee." And that was a symbolic term to talk about the fact that he would be taken in captivity and ultimately crucified.
[time=3186] And the story is told that Peter not only followed the Lord in his discipleship, but
[time=3192] he followed the Lord right straight to the cross.
[time=3197] Secular authorities tell us that when Peter came to die, his confession of faith was that
[time=3203] the one who had died for him and had loved him so had hung upon a cross.
[time=3208] Peter said, "I am not worthy to be crucified in the same matter as my Savior, and they hung him at his own request upside down." He was crucified.
[time=3218] He's a reminder to me that it's so easy for us to say, "Lord, I will follow thee, but
[time=3224] we don't understand that in the following of the Lord there's a cross in the future.
[time=3229] There's a reproach to be born for his name, and the Lord could say to all of us today with our easy statements of discipleship, "You're not ready to follow me yet, but perhaps someday you'll be ready." And the time between his prophecy and the fulfillment of it was filled with the Lord's general dealing with Peter, first of all with a prayer and then with a look, then with a special message, a meeting on a road someplace to console and talk with him, and then this
[time=3256] final and last recommissioning.
[time=3261] A tragic ending to the story is that Peter had no sooner been recommissioned than once
[time=3267] again got his eyes off the Lord, and he turned to see John who was standing by him, and he said, "Lord, what shall this man do?" And the Lord said, "Peter, that's none of your business.
[time=3276] You follow me." May I say to you, that the Savior who brought back Peter is waiting for you.
[time=3289] Are you far away?
[time=3292] Have you denied the Lord?
[time=3295] His wounded hands, which are nailed to the cross, reach out to you to bring you back.
[time=3303] The circumstances of this setting this morning may be exactly what God created so that you would be sensitive to His call.
[time=3310] Through His word, He sends a message to your heart.
[time=3314] He's present beside you in the ministry of the Holy Spirit as He speaks to your life.
[time=3319] This is your chance, your opportunity.
[time=3322] Will you come back?
[time=3324] Shall we pray?
[time=3326] Father, O what grace, O what grace to follow after one who denied the.
[time=3340] Satan would have us believe that once having sinned, there's no hope for recovery.
[time=3346] God would have us to believe that He stands ready and waiting for us to return.

[time=3506] The Bible hour has been made possible by the members of the Founders Club.
[time=3511] The Founders Club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach
[time=3518] ministry.
[time=3519] Perhaps you have never come to the moment of confession in your life, whereby invitation
[time=3527] you have invited Christ to be your Savior, accepted Him as your Lord, and the Spirit of God is using the Word of God today to make you aware of your need.
[time=3536] I wonder how many here today could say, "Preacher, I am not sure that I am saved, that I have trusted Christ, that I have been born again.
[time=3543] Would you pray for me?
[time=3544] I want to be included in this prayer.
[time=3546] I want to be sure that I am saved.
[time=3548] Would you lift your hand?" "Wherever you might be, I am not sure that I know Christ.
[time=3553] I can't remember that I have ever put my trust in Him.
[time=3556] Would you pray for me today?" "Yes, thank you.
[time=3558] I see your hand."
