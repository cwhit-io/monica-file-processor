[time=17] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=31] The morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church has been televised into homes for a little over four years now.
[time=38] And at the beginning of the Ministry of Television, we determined that our priority would always be that this was the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and that our friends who watch at home were simply asked to share with us in what we normally do.
[time=53] Now on occasion, there are some things that we do not do and other things that we do do because our television people are here.
[time=61] Today, we have struggled with whether or not we would share all of this service with our friends at home.
[time=67] This is an intimate time for the family of Black Hawk, and we had even toyed with the idea of preparing a special program that would go to the friends at home.
[time=76] And I thought about that in my own heart, and I've come to the conclusion that if they're part of our extended family, they'll understand family business and family time together.
[time=85] And so this is a sharing time for the Black Hawk Baptist Church and its ministry, and we welcome all of you now who have opened the window of the Church in your home to share with us this hour.
[time=96] I trust that you will be much in prayer during this time that God will use this hour to encourage our hearts as we take a look into the future.
[time=104] Our Minister of Music, Mr. Don Kruger, is away in special meetings with his brother this week, and we're happy that there is someone who can stand in and fill his place in the directing of the choir.
[time=116] I trust you'll listen now as our choir sings the song entitled "Redeemed" and they're under the leadership of Mr. Rick Halls.
[time=124] [MUSIC]
[time=154] # Redeemed and so happy in Jesus #
[time=164] # Will likewise # # My rapture kept ill # # I know that the light # # Resressed with me # # That's continually 12 # # Redeemed and redeemed # # Redeemed # # But the blood of the Lamb # # Deep through his infant bursting # # His child and forever I am # # I know #
[time=196] # I shall see # # In his beauty # # Like King # # In his mighty light # # Ooo, lonely # # Regardless of steps and giving # # He's on to the guard # # Redeemed and redeemed # # Redeemed but the blood of the Lamb # # Deep through his infant bursting # # His child and forever I am # # His child and forever I am #
[time=239] We're so grateful that you're a part of today's Bible Hour.
[time=244] And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all you're doing to make this a ministry that extends into many thousands of homes here in this area and in four other locations where the Bible Hour is seen.
[time=255] We take this time during the reception of our offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to speak directly to you.
[time=262] And it is our privilege to talk to you about those things in this ministry that pertain to you and your family and we trust your own spiritual life.
[time=270] Don, I think one of the great things that God has given to us through the television ministry is the opportunity to extend an arm of help into many homes.
[time=281] That's right.
[time=282] Many times people come to us with questions about how they can learn to study the Bible that they really want to do.
[time=291] They really want to study the Bible, and I know even in my own life I have the desire there, but many times I feel frustrated that I'm not getting out of it what I should.
[time=300] In keeping with the name the Bible Hour, it should be our purpose, and I think it is our responsibility to be doing all we can, not only to teach the Bible from the pulpit, but also to extend help into the homes of people so they can get into the Word for themselves.
[time=315] One of the ways we do that is through the Book of the Month, which is a very special little Bible study guide that we send to those people who are part of our support group, and we don't have time even to talk about that today.
[time=326] I think that is one of the most exciting things we've done, and we've gotten such good response to it.
[time=331] But then we like to supplement that and make available to all of our many friends, special Bible study tools that they can keep right in their own home.
[time=340] And we've gone through a number of those and had the privilege of extending them into the homes of people, Bible study guides and analytical surveys of the Bible, etc.
[time=350] But right now we're dealing with one of the most exciting, concise little Bible study tools that I've yet seen.
[time=356] It's a little book entitled, "Four Thousand Questions and Answers on the Bible." What is basically the gist of this tool, Donna?
[time=365] It takes the books of the Bible in order from Genesis through Revelation and answers specific questions on that passage as you're reading through the book, so if you're reading in Genesis and have a question, you can open the book right up to Genesis and it deals with the passage that you're reading in the Scripture at that time.
[time=383] Donna, I was just opening the book this morning to read from the book of John, and let's just assume for a moment that we were studying together John 14, the great passage where the Lord predicted that in his father's house were many mansions, and that he was going to come back someday to take those to be with his father.
[time=400] In the 14th chapter of John, the first question is this, "What is meant by the father's house?"
[time=406] And the answer is very succinctly put, "Our home in heaven." The second question is, "How must we come to the father and by Christ who is the only way?"
[time=415] The third question is, "How do we know that our Lord was a manifestation of the father?" And the answer is, "By Christ's assertion to Philip that whosoever had seen him had seen the father."
[time=426] Now the interesting thing about the book is that those questions just go almost verse for verse right down through John 14, so as you're reading it, if a question pops into your mind, what do you do?
[time=437] Just turn to that particular passage that's in that book in order, and it's right there.
[time=442] And you don't have to look into the concordance, or you don't have to look into some long index, but you can look right into the book and it follows consecutively your study of the Bible.
[time=452] It's been intriguing to me to see you with all your books laid out on the table at home for women's Bible study and to find this tool among the others that you're using.
[time=460] There are other important aspects to that little book too. In the back there are several sections with additional helps.
[time=467] There's one section on how to study the Bible, pointers of how to get the most out of your scripture study.
[time=473] And there's another place in there that deals with the great Bible stories and where to find them.
[time=479] And there's just a number of exciting little things stuck in the back that are of great help.
[time=484] I was going to say, Donna, that this was small enough to put in your purse.
[time=488] I think you can get it in most of your purses. Some of the ladies may not be able to get it in theirs.
[time=492] But I do know it's small enough to stick in a briefcase and take with you on a business trip.
[time=496] It's not quite small enough to put in your inside coat pocket, but it's a very thin, concise booklet that you can just put along with your Bible.
[time=505] And it just fits right there. Sometimes you might want to care it to church and see if your pastor is really preaching the truth.
[time=510] But it's a great little booklet and we have a great joy in our heart to be able to extend this into your home and make it available to you.
[time=517] And we want to tell you right now how you can have your copy of 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible.
[time=524] The easiest way for you to obtain your copy is to call our toll-free number. That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=534] Ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like the booklet 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible.
[time=542] That number to call again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=548] And Donna, we're so grateful to have that tool available to us to close the cycle of communication, to make it possible for them to close the loop and get back to us.
[time=558] And we want to ask you right now if you haven't already received this special tool, to go to your phone and dial 1-800-247-2160.
[time=567] And ask for the book 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible.
[time=571] If you would like to write to us, perhaps you have a prayer request or some question you would like for us to answer.
[time=577] Maybe you want to just encourage us by sharing what the Bible Hour is meaning in your home.
[time=581] Then, of course, you may do that too.
[time=583] And when you write, you should write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=591] Most important, however, is that you remember this number because it's the easiest way to get to us.
[time=596] Donna, give it to them again, will you?
[time=598] That toll-free number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=604] And you may use that number at any time of the day or night to get in touch with us anytime during the week.
[time=609] Donna, in just a few moments, I'm going to give one of the most important messages that I've ever given to our congregation.
[time=615] We stand at the threshold of the greatest challenge we've ever faced as a church.
[time=620] And sometimes I think maybe we ought to close the doors to our outside friends when we give something as intimate as I'm going to give today.
[time=628] And yet, I really believe that the many folks who are part of our television family really do belong to us and are part of our greater congregation.
[time=635] So we're just going to let it all out today and let them be a part of it as we face the future and our challenge that's before us.
[time=642] I trust you'll stay with us because this is a crucial message, and I think you'll sense the heartbeat of this church.
[time=648] As you share with us in a few moments, my vision for the future of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=653] We have some more music, and then we'll be in the word in just a few moments.
[time=657] Please stay with us. We appreciate so much your presence in today's Bible, our audience.
[time=663] Let us sing together hymn number 26.
[time=669] Come now, found of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace.
[time=674] Standing just for the first stanza, hymn number 26.
[time=684] Come now, come now, every blessing, to the heart of this deep and great.
[time=694] We come to mercy, to the heart of this deep, our love has come, our friends.
[time=704] Please, come now, every blessing, to the heart of this deep, our love has come.
[time=726] You may be seated.
[time=733] During the last hour in our church year, we viewed a very special presentation of the history of our Sunday school from its beginning over nine years ago to its present status.
[time=744] You know, it's a wonderful thing to look back and see that some of the folks who ministered to us in those early days
[time=751] continue to minister.
[time=752] Their ministry has grown because of the outreach and because of the number of people here.
[time=757] One of the people who's consistently and faithfully ministered to us in music has been bev brunky.
[time=763] Way back in the little chapel in the trailers, she sang for us quite often Sunday morning and Sunday night.
[time=769] And then as we move from the old chapel here, God has continued to use her.
[time=773] She's going to sing for us a song today that I know will be a real blessing to your heart.
[time=787] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=829] A place where I can find peace and joy combined.
[time=845] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=919] A place where I can find peace and joy combined.
[time=927] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=987] Thank you Beverly.
[time=991] Now I want you to take your Bibles and turn with me to the sixth chapter of Mark's Gospel.
[time=997] The sixth chapter of Mark's Gospel.
[time=1001] And I want to read just two or three verses from this chapter.
[time=1009] And this is going to be a very unusual message, unlike the kind that I normally give.
[time=1015] And that ought to keep some of you awake for at least the first five minutes.
[time=1021] Mark chapter six.
[time=1025] And they departed into a desert place by boat secretly.
[time=1033] And the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran a foot out of all cities and went before them and came together unto him.
[time=1041] And Jesus, when he came out, saw many or multitudes of people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd.
[time=1053] And he began to teach them many things. Shall we pray?
[time=1061] Father in heaven we pray that you will take control of these next moments that we spend together by the Spirit of God that you will direct the mind and the speech of the one who speaks and the hearts that receive the message wherever it is heard.
[time=1081] Father, I pray that somehow in just these brief moments that we spend together we will catch a glimpse of the burden and heartbeat of our Savior.
[time=1093] And that we can be drawn into that sense of responsibility with Him.
[time=1101] Be brought to remember that we are called to be co-workers with Him.
[time=1109] Joint hairs that somehow the ministry of this moment in each of our lives will be a turning point to cause us to see our responsibility to a lost and dying world.
[time=1125] We rejoice in what you have done for us as a church in the past.
[time=1129] Our hearts are filled with that as we have viewed it just moments ago.
[time=1133] And we realize the past can either be a tool to encourage us for the future or it can be used by our adversary to give us a sense of complacency and smugness in past accomplishments. Lord, you have put this day together for the purpose of using it for thine own honor and glory.
[time=1157] And we pray that our hearts will be open to receive from heaven.
[time=1161] To us today through His servant.
[time=1165] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=1169] During these last days different members of our congregation who have been chosen for a specific ministry have been visiting the congregation in their homes, praying with them about the future of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1189] Never have we had so wide and extensive a prayer ministry.
[time=1193] Never have we needed so much prayer as we need now.
[time=1201] Over these past years God has seen fit to abundantly bless this church beyond anything that any of us ever dreamed possible.
[time=1209] It has been evident that in some special way for some unknown reason He has had His hand upon us and He has directed us in the formulation of ministries which reach into the very homes and hearts of people in this area.
[time=1225] We have come to a place in the ministry where we need to stop and take knowledge of the past in order that we might look to the future for God's continued direction upon this congregation and His leading into the ministry that lies before us.
[time=1245] Now I've been present from the beginning and I have gone through the anguish of every step and I want to say to you that never in all of my life have I fought internally in my own heart face the anguish of soul that I face during these days as we've contemplated the future.
[time=1265] Someone told me a long time ago that when you walk by faith it gets easier as you go along. I haven't found that to be true.
[time=1273] I found that every time we take a step God makes it just a little bit larger than the one before and it gets harder every time.
[time=1281] Along with that we get older and we get more secure conscious more conscious of our security and what the future has for us and I'll have to be honest with you that many times in these last days as we've looked to the future I found myself thinking along these lines. Jeremiah what's wrong with you?
[time=1301] In the world are you leading these people into something as extensive as this?
[time=1305] Why if you just take it easy and conserve your gains you can develop a very comfortable ministry over on that corner and you can feel safe you have a place to go every week and there are good people why in the world are you looking to the future? I've had to go back to the scripture and ask God to give me a fresh touch of the purpose of our ministry. You know it's not hard for us along the way we build and as we grow and as we consolidate and as we organize if we're not careful to lose sight of the impact which got us started and to begin to be more concerned about maintaining the organizational structure and making the ministry work and making sure that we have enough money to pay the bills and hiring the staff that we need all of which is important but somehow in all of the mechanical nature of the administration of the church to lose sight of why we're here and that to which God has called us I found myself going back through the epistles and reading the words of Paul and thinking about what motivated him in his life. Ultimately I came all the way back to the gospels to the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ and I think I saw again for a new and fresh time that which caused our Savior to be what he was and what he is. This which we have read from the book of Mark is just one little glimpse into his life. It is the record of the Savior with the multitudes of people gathered around him and the Scripture says when he saw them he was moved with compassion upon them because they were as sheep scattered with how to shepherd and he taught them. The compassion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was not just an emotional experience that caught him up in a moment of flurry but it was an experience and a part of his life that ultimately took him to the cross where he was nailed and where he suffered to pay for the sins of mankind. I'd like for us this morning if we could to try to see our situation through the eyes of the Savior to try to look at the ministry that God has given to us as a church as if the Savior were seeing it for us. Trying to ask ourselves the question what would he do in our place? What is it that he wants from us? I'd like for us to think together today from these three verses about three very basic thoughts. The first one is this, consideration.
[time=1453] The Scripture says that he saw the multitudes.
[time=1457] Several years ago my wife and I had the opportunity to travel to a Baptist Congress meeting in London, England.
[time=1465] The memories of that oftentimes come back to bring us joy as we think together of the experiences that we had there, one of which we shall never forget. We had decided one night to go down into the heart of London town and it was at the time of the closing of the industry there.
[time=1485] We got down into the heart of the city just as all of the shops and the industries and all the people were let out of work and we were writing what they call the tube, the subway. Almost without warning people started to stream out of every rock and crevice.
[time=1501] They just inundated us and covered us up and it was frightening.
[time=1505] The next thing we knew somebody had grabbed hold of us and pushed us in the door of the subway and the door closed on us and off we went. We weren't even sure if we were on the right train. I have never in all my life seen so many people in such a small area.
[time=1521] And I remember as we rode the train that day thinking in my heart I remember how many of these people have ever heard a clear witness of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1533] I know something about the spiritual climate in London and I can tell you precious few have ever heard.
[time=1537] A few days ago I had a business appointment in New York City and I haven't been there for years.
[time=1545] I didn't even know for sure where I was headed but the taxi took me right down to 51st street right across from Rockefeller Square and I went to a little office where I was to meet a man and all of a sudden I was down in the midst of that metropolis teeming with multitudes of people and the same thought came to my heart.
[time=1561] I wonder how many of these people in this tremendously populated city have ever heard of Christ, have ever heard of the Savior.
[time=1569] Last night we were invited by some friends to go out and eat and we went to a restaurant that's high atop our city in one of the bank buildings.
[time=1577] As far as I know it's the highest point in the city where you can eat at least, we had a wonderful time of fellowship and I looked out of the windows of that city all around on every side were lights of the city spreading out in every direction and the same thought came to me.
[time=1593] I wonder how many people in this city have ever heard an intelligible witness concerning the saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1601] They tell us that in the metropolitan Fort Wayne area there are some 400,000 people gathered here today are 1,000 plus. We have in our church today 1/400 of the people who are within easy driving distance of our church. Those who tell us about our television ministry tell us that if we are conservative we could reasonably assume that on a given Sunday morning some 7 to 10,000 homes in that metropolitan area turn on their television to watch this service so that's a little bit more but think of it just such a small group. You say pastor there are other churches that are reaching them and I know that and I understand that but I believe God has called us as a church to reach out and touch the lives of people as if there were no other church ever existing and that he's made us responsible for our community and for the people around us to minister to them or the multitudes.
[time=1657] I wish that somehow I could get the Savior's heart as we look out upon the multitudes of people today. I find it so easy to walk among the crowds in the shopping centers and in the downtown areas and be there in the midst of people, many of whom don't know about our Savior and have no feeling whatsoever. That wasn't the Savior's heart. The Scripture says when the multitudes came together he was moved with compassion.
[time=1681] This week I got a letter from one of our missionaries who serves God over in San Paolo, Brazil, one of the finest young missionaries that I believe we have any place in the world, Norm Nicholas, and he sent me some pictures of apartment complexes in downtown San Paolo and he gave me statistics telling me that within the month of October 1000 new families were going to be moving in right around the place where he wanted to build a new church and he was saying pastor we need help, somehow we've got to reach the multitudes of San Paolo, can you help us? I don't know what God's going to do in all of this ministry and program that we're in right now but somehow we've got to find some way to help Norm Nicholas reach the multitudes of San Paolo.
[time=1721] The Bible says that when Jesus looked out upon the crowds he saw multitudes and he was moved with compassion. I want you to consider for a moment that to which God has called us. Here in our area all about us are lonely people, people who are hurting older people, younger people, children, men and women and families who have never heard that there's an answer in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1745] Someone told me recently that in the greater Fort Wayne area there are over 10,000 college and career people. We have a few of them that come here to our church and others who are in Bible believing churches but the vast majority of college and career people are not being confronted with the claims of Christ and have never heard a clear presentation of the Savior. They're children running on all the streets today. If you weren't here and you were driving through the avenues of our sophisticated area of this town you would discover that there's a vast majority of young people and children who never go to Sunday school.
[time=1781] Oh if they went to the hospital they would sign up that their members in such and such a church but they don't go enough to know who the staff are and those children need to be reached for Christ and God's given us a Sunday school and a Christian school and all kinds of avenues to reach them.
[time=1797] Out in the avenues and byways of our city are women who are lonely, who are looking for someone to come to them with a message of encouragement and we need to reach out to them working in the highways and byways and businesses and all of the establishments of our city are men. Men who are trying to climb the ladder to success but their hearts are empty and they're filled with despair because nobody ever came alongside of them and said there's another way to live in this world and we have the answer.
[time=1829] Move out past our city and our state and our nation to the four billion souls on this globe and I ask you what percentage of them have ever heard about Jesus Christ. I can't help but think of our Savior we're standing here today. He would be in some measure looking out at that to which God has called us in this community and he would be considering the multitudes. How could we ever for a moment give any consideration to the possibility of saying Lord we've reached our part. Let somebody else do the rest.
[time=1861] God has given to us a vast harvest field and a great opportunity in this area and I believe that if we're to see that opportunity through the eyes of our Savior we will consider the multitudes.
[time=1873] I notice secondly in this passage that the Scripture says he didn't just consider them, he didn't just see them. The Scripture says he was moved with compassion. The word there is a word from which we get our word peroxism. It means that he had an emotional experience that caused the very heart of his heart to be touched. That he was moved almost to tears that he was hurting inside because of what he saw in the needs of men and women. And the other passages where it says that our Lord was moved with compassion it talks about him looking at those who are halt and lame and dumb and blind who needed help in seeing a crying out of humanity and being touched in his heart because of their need.
[time=1921] Compassion is Christ.
[time=1925] Christ is compassion. He came out of Heaven's glory to this world to become a man and walk among us because of his compassion.
[time=1933] Every time you see him in the New Testament working a miracle oh yes it's to bring authority to his message but there was no miracle Christ ever performed that did not come out of a heart of compassion for those to whom he ministered. When he preaches you cannot help but feel the compassion in his words. There was nothing of the harshness and severity that we find so often in gospel preachers today. There was a heart that bled for the people to whom he communicated oftentimes punctuated I'm sure with tears as he spoke to them. Yes sometimes hard words. He spoke to them strongly but only because he recognized that that was the only way he could get through the hard core shell to their hearts.
[time=1977] He preached with compassion. I believe he told the story of the good
[time=1983] Samaritan, gave the parable of prodigal son because of his compassion for those who were despised and neglected and rejected.
[time=1991] His very stories and illustrations came out of a compassion at heart. He went to the cross because of his compassion. You and I would be headed for hell without any hope or without any possibilities for the future if our Lord hadn't cared enough and gone to the cross with compassion for us.
[time=2011] Scripture tells me that right now in heaven he's seated next to the Father and in compassion he makes intercession for us sharing those burdens which are on our hearts that we cannot put into words because he's the compassionate Savior. I happen to believe that that was the secret of his great power over this universe. The secret of the great strength and power of our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ was his compassion for mankind and one day when he went upon Mount Calvary and he was put there upon the cross and the nails were driven into his hands and he stood there before all mankind to see with his arms outstretched. Perhaps that was the greatest sign of his compassion. Arms stretched from the east to the west to encompass all mankind as if to say come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=2063] Oh what a compassionate Savior we have.
[time=2067] Sometimes when I preach just for a moment I get caught up in the compassion of our Savior and tears come to my eyes as I think of the lossness of mankind without Jesus Christ.
[time=2079] But oh how often our hearts are cold and indifferent so unlike our Savior. The world today is trying to find the answer in other things. We have quite a collection of clowns that try to entertain them and meet their needs.
[time=2095] We have secularists who come along with their philosophy and say this is the way but you know what I've discovered. When a man gets into a very difficult straighter when he comes to the hour of death or sorrow or agony in his own heart he reaches for that which closely approximates the compassion of the Lord Jesus Christ. He wants somebody who's got touch with God to come and help him. Because even a man who's never known the reality of Christ that you and I know knows something of the compassion of the Savior. A few moments ago Rick opened the scripture to read for us that wonderful passage in the 23rd chapter of Matthew.
[time=2131] I stood one day not long ago almost in the place where the Savior stood when he looked out over the city of Jerusalem the people for whom he had come those of his chosen people and he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathered her brood but she would not you can feel and hear and sense the compassion in the words of the Savior as he reaches out to the attitudes around him with a heart that cared oh if this could just be what it was for us today oh if this world could just once again feel the compassion of the Savior if just for a moment Jesus could come back and walk among us and we could sense his compassion but he is gone he's back in heaven as far as most of the world is concerned he's absent I have news for you when the Lord Jesus was here in his body it was through his body that men felt the compassion of his heart he reached out one day to touch a lame man in the scripture said he had compassion on him he touched the hurts of his world through his body he reached out to mankind through the human body that was given to him when he came into this world you know what the Bible says the Bible says that he still has a body in this world and you know who that body is that body is every one of us who know and love Jesus Christ the Bible says that the church is the body of Christ and there is no need for a world to be crying out for the return so that compassion can be felt for his body is present it is here in this world today and God has called that body into existence and he is adding to the body daily such as should be saved that that body might be the means of expressing the compassionate heart of Christ to a lost and dying world and in as much as you and I are involved in being what Christ was in his day in our day we are fulfilling that purpose for which this body exists as Christ reached out to touch the lost and the hurt and the and the score of his generation he intends for his body in this generation to be doing the same thing and so as I think back over the ministries of the Black Hawk Baptist Church I ask myself the question in what way and in what measure and with what vision do we as a part of the body of Christ extend ourselves out to touch the lives of men and women in our generation where this local body is meeting to fulfill the heart cry of a Savior who was filled with compassion I believe that God expects his church today to be the instrument of compassion in a world that needs so desperately to hear the message of love let me think with you for just a moment along that line I personally believe that the Lord Jesus who said one day suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not is vastly interested in the Sunday school enterprise of this church that reaches out and to broken homes and established homes and homes where single parents are and brings little children together under the loving teaching of a teacher who is committed to Christ and ministers to them out of compassion I'm deeply concerned and committed to the fact that the Lord Jesus who gathered his disciples together and sent them out two by two is definitely interested in what we do in our evangelism program as we train men and women and send them out into homes to touch individuals who need to hear from God that he cares and that there's compassion to be found I'm deeply committed to the fact that the Lord Jesus who ministered from the word of God and taught and preached wherever he gathered a crowd together is deeply interested in what happens right here in this pulpit as the word of God has preached I'm committed to the fact that the Lord who one day sat down by a well and ministered to a woman of Samaria and another time knelt in the sand and drew a picture to communicate about the needs of a woman caught in adultery who has done more for womanhood in this world than any man ever did is deeply interested in the ministry he's given us to reach women in our generation I'm committed to the fact that the one who counseled with Nicodemus at night and oftentimes held counseling sessions and all kinds of circumstances is deeply interested in what God has brought into play here in this church through the ministry of Dr. Ken Nichols to touch and heal and help the lives of people who are hurting I'm committed to the fact that the Lord who had such a heart of compassion for men and women of all ages in every strata of life is deeply committed to what George Lantman is doing as he begins to minister to senior people and try to help them and encourage them and be a source of joy to them I'm committed to the fact that our Savior who went early in his life to the temple to be involved in the instruction of the temple is excited about that which we do when we open our doors on Monday through Friday for the Christian school program and we teach our children and we indoctrinate them with the word of God and give them a world life view that's centered in God and his word I believe, I say this advisedly but I believe that if the Lord Jesus were here and he saw them altitudes and he saw them with compassion and he saw them as sheep that were scattered without a shepherd I believe that though he would do far more and certainly in a vastly different way I believe we would be doing many of the things God has called us together to do we're His body now, we're to be the instrument to reach out and to touch the lives of men and women and to let them know that there is somebody that cares and to let them hear the good news that God in heaven wants to be their God oh the compassion of the Savior how little we measure up to such a standard may I say to you that anything in this church that does not center on the compassionate heart of the Savior reaching out to the multitudes needs to be totally re-examined as we gather our gifts and offerings every Sunday and a portion of that is set into a special missionary fund and hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years have gone out to the various areas of the mission field and here locally in the television ministry some $300,000 going out to touch other cities beside Fort Wayne I believe God is interested in that and I believe if he were here he'd want to encourage us to keep doing it to do it better than we've ever done it before to touch more people than we've ever touched before oh I hear people come and say pastor are you sure we should be continuing to grow don't you think we better stop and and take stock and get comfortable listen if we're to be God's instrument in a world how much time do we have to let them know that he cares and to stretch out the arms of compassion every avenue I want you to consider the multitudes I want you to think for a moment of the compassion and I want you to think for a moment with me in closing of commitment I find it so easy among people today to say yes I care we have so overemphasized the importance of saying I love you that you can say I love you commitment whatsoever people get married and say I love you and five weeks later they're bitter enemies I love you doesn't mean anything from the lips commitment to care commitment for compassion means something far more than just to say it or to see it commitment means that somewhere along the way you've got to face the needs of mankind and get involved at a sacrificial level to meet those needs the Lord Jesus considered and he had compassion but he cared and he committed himself to meet those needs the Scripture says he taught them but his teaching took him one day to the cross where he became the sacrifice to redeem them and all of the ministries of our church ought to be in that redemptive vein and if they are they will cost us never before as we have faced the future as a church have I ever in my whole life faced the commitment
[time=2671] as I've had to face it this time we don't have enough property here we don't have enough buildings you come here on a Tuesday morning and see what it's like around here with a school and a woman's Bible study we don't have enough room and facilities and parking to continue to care like we ought to care and if we don't do something our compassionate ministry is going to have a circle drawn around it we won't be able to do anymore every Sunday hundreds of people get in their cars and drive to the Georgetown Shopping Center and get on a city bus and come all the way down here and then they go to the junior high school some and drive their cars there and ride buses here we don't have even close to enough parking to meet the needs of the people who want to come here to church and folks if we're going to change that it's going to cost us something sometimes I like to think what it would be like to be a member of this church if I weren't the pastor I hope I'd still be here do you know I've been thinking a lot about that recently and I think if I were a member of this church and we were headed in the direction that God has headed us through the leadership ministry of this church and I were sitting out there where you are looking up at a pastor where I am I'd want to know what is my pastor's commitment to this ministry some of you have come to me and said pastor I'm pretty excited about this ministry but what happens if we get part of the way in this and you decide to go somewhere else you know I need to talk to you about my commitment you need to hear that you have a right to know where I am we're going to do this together but God calls people to be leaders and you need to know whether you're leaders committed to it I can stand up here and say it but you need to hear it from me right now in this context first of all I want to talk to you about the commitment of my presence here I believe I've been through Waterloo there I faced the one thing I feared I'd have to face in my lifetime and that was the situation in a college where my father's been God has given me victory and committed me to the fact that he's called me to be the pastor I've never had more commitment in my own life to the fact that I belong in the pastorate right here than I've ever had I believe this is where God's called me my commitment to you is if we start down this road I'm not going to leave in the middle you all can come to church some Sunday and decide that the pressures too rough and go across town find five or six good churches and we'll say goodbye God bless you thank you for what you've done and they'll welcome you with open arms but I can't do that if we get started into this ministry you have to understand my commitment is to see it through the commitment of my presence God lets me live through it I'll be here when the shouting takes place secondly you need to know something about the commitment of my leadership what we're about to do is going to cost a great deal of energy thank God for the staff that he's brought but you already know that we're doing more than humanly possible with the leadership that we have and I want you to know that as long as God gives me breath and energy we're going to stay together ahead of this thing and move us in the direction we ought to go you have the commitment of my leadership now I want to say something to you that I know some of you are going to understand and some of you are going to misunderstand I want to talk to you about the commitment of my finances you say pastor do you give oh yes I was taught to give when I was growing up and the pastor ought to be leading his congregation giving I've consistently been a tither and much more and I give to the school we love to give what God has entrusted to us but I'm not talking now about regular finances I'm talking about what God has been speaking to me about in terms of my own personal commitment to this ministry it's easy for me to stand up and say folks we're going to move into a building program that will cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars
[time=2917] but you have the right to know pastor where are you in that what are you going to do I have to tell you about some conversations I've had with the Lord I've been talking to him about this you remember when we had our impossible offering several years ago all of the different families of our church who were part of the nucleus got together we believe God wanted us to build this building we're in right now how thankful we are we did that and most ever one of us determined that as families we'd give a thousand dollars to that impossible offering there came a night when we announced that and we began to work toward it and different ones of us began to pray about it and people began to bring their commitments and on our fifth anniversary Sunday we had a walk around offering people came down to the front of the congregation and my wife and I stood there and greeted them and they came and placed their gifts at the disposal of the Lord and what a glorious day that was $76,000 in one offering but you know something I'd had two babies in our family in just a short time we had moved into a house still trying to get out from under the burden of our seminary education I didn't have two nickels to rub together and I went out and borrowed a thousand dollars and gave it and I just a few months ago got that paid off so when I was talking to the Lord about this ministry I said Lord you know what I did in the past this is a three year program I believe I can give a thousand dollars a year I don't think he even heard me so I gulped and I thought I'd try again later in the meantime we had two more babies since the last episode and we'd been living in that little house and we had such close fellowship and every time the doorbell rang panic hit we wondered because the playroom was everywhere so we begin to pray Lord help us find a bigger house and different ones of the congregation prayed and God used one of our good couples here to help us and we found a found a home near the one that we lived before and we just moved into that home and this together we build thing hit us and I said Lord how in the world are we going to give sacrificially to this program we just moved into a new house payments are a little higher and I don't believe in the audible voice of the Lord I want you to understand that I think it's always dangerous when people start talking about hearing God speak to him out of the sky but he spoke to me in my heart and this is what he said Jeremiah you know how carefully you put aside some funds so the went that house was finished you could finish off that unfinished room for that pet project of yours that you've dreamed about that special study at home I said Lord surely you're not talking about that but I knew that he was you see I'm like a lot of you folks to my knowledge I've never really ever sacrificed anything for God all time and energy maybe but I mean financially I've given God's blessed and he's enabled me to keep giving but I asked myself when I think I told Don I said honey I don't think you and I have ever really had to sacrifice anything we wanted for God and all of a sudden I began to feel something of the joy of the Lord in my heart as I began to realize that there was something that I wanted desperately and maybe God was going to let me give a part of that to this effort and I began to talk to him about this and we began to pray together and I wanted more than anything else for what we gave not only to be what we could reasonably assume we might sacrifice but something beyond that something beyond what we could even possibly think we might be able to give something that would be in the area of revelation giving something that God would say to us you determined to give this by the grace of God I'll supply the need and so there was a day not long ago when the steering committee of this together we build program got together and I tell you what I didn't eat all day I had to tell him what I was going to do and I struggled with it and you know I went through the process and some of you've gone through in this whole matter of witnessing commitments I said Lord I don't know that this witnessing commitments is too ethical I don't know if we ought to be doing this I'm not sure that's the way it ought to be done finally I got dead certain and honest with myself and discovered what I knew all along I wasn't concerned about witnessing commitment I was concerned about the commitment I was going to have to witness I just think that as a member of this church you need to hear from me what I believe God wants you to hear in your own heart men and women we cannot do what God has called us to do without the spirit of sacrifice and what God has been doing in my heart he's been doing in some of your hearts I have no doubt in my mind but what the resources for the new ministry God has for us are available to us if we will begin to commit ourselves to it in a new and better way now let me say something to you some of you could not possibly ever give six thousand dollars and if that's true then don't you go home feeling bad because you can't some of you could give way beyond that and if that's true you ought to go home feeling bad and you ought to give it right isn't that true don't you let my commitment to you be a source of excuse if you could do do more or a source of discouragement if you can't do that much the whole ministry of this church and of this program is not equal gifts but equal sacrifice and I face the future along with you frightened I don't know what it holds for the first time we're going to start down a road and we're going to be on the road before we know how it can possibly be that we'll get to the end of it but that's what faith is all about though I'm frightened I'm filled with adventure and enthusiasm like I've never been before because these are the exciting days of our church and as God does a work in each of your hearts and as he brings you to this point of commitment in your own life you just do what God tells you to do you pray about it you ask God to help you agonize about it you look for something in your life that you can sacrifice to give to God that's where you find joy in giving and you begin to ask God to help you put that together in your own heart I'll tell you I've spent some kind of a week I've wished that this Sunday would never come
[time=3346] I didn't want to have to get up here and do this and I've asked God to figure out some other way for it to be done but I knew he wanted me to do it and as I look to the future sometimes even though I'm excited about about what we're going to do together as a church family I ask the Lord, Lord White, why is it that we're responsible for all of this?
[time=3368] and you know there's a very simple answer and it's in the word it goes like this to whom much has been given much is required how we rejoice at what God has given us as a church what are we supposed to do with that reinvest it cause it to grow ask God to help us in every way possible to make it something more than it is and it's a big burden it really is
