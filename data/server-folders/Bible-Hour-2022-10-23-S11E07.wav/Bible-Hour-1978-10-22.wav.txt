[time=0] - From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present
[time=21] The Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah, and all God's people said, and you may be seated.
[time=51] Certainly, a thrilling thing to begin the morning service with the singing of such a
[time=58] great hymn of praise and adoration to the Lord.
[time=63] Everywhere you go, every place that you visit, sooner or later you will touch Christians
[time=73] who have come to the conclusion that their salvation is to be something they enjoy without
[time=79] sharing it with others.
[time=82] Even though the Bible is clear in its instruction to us to be going into all the world and preaching the gospel, there are some among God's people who have come to the conclusion that salvation is something to be personally enjoyed, but not ever to be personally shared.
[time=99] It's a strange thing to open the Bible to the Old Testament and see that very clearly even back in the Chronicles and Kings, there are illustrations of the responsibility of the
[time=110] believer to be sharing that which God has entrusted to His care.
[time=115] We have chosen for our lesson today a story from the Book of Second Kings hidden in between
[time=121] some of the miraculous dealings of God through the Prophet Elisha, and we shall turn there in a few moments to see God's example to us from the Old Testament.
[time=131] First we have some special music we want to share with you, and the choir has chosen a song to sing today that is very appropriate for the outreach ministry of this church,
[time=143] the Bible Hour.
[time=145] Their song is entitled, "God's Word Shall Stand." "God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, a tight-broze
[time=165] of God's Word Shall Stand, a tight-broze of God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall
[time=179] Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, a tight-broze of God's Word
[time=209] Shall Stand, He threw at four, no things deeper than ever, till halls of nations in His mighty
[time=221] hand.
[time=222] "God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, God's Word Shall Stand, He's still my soul
[time=252] Lord, our Moses with thee, He's still my soul, Lord, our Moses with thee, He's still
[time=294] He's still my soul, Lord, our Moses with thee, He's still my soul, Lord, our Moses
[time=307] with thee, He's still my soul, Lord, our Moses with thee, He's still my soul, Lord, God." Today our lives stand sure on the standing and living Word of God.
[time=319] And I would like to read a portion of God's Word for you today as it's found in 2 Kings chapter 7, the first nine verses.
[time=328] Then Elisha said, "Hear ye the Word of the Lord, thus sayeth the Lord, tomorrow, about
[time=335] this time, shall measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley
[time=343] for a shekel in the gate of Samaria." Then a Lord on whose hand the King leaned answered the man of God and said, "Behold,
[time=355] if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be." And he said, "Behold, thou shall see it with thine eyes, and thou shall not eat of it."
[time=369] And there were four lepersmen at the entrance of the gate, and they said to one another,
[time=375] why sit we hear until we die?
[time=378] If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die
[time=384] there.
[time=386] And if we sit here, we die also.
[time=389] Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians.
[time=394] If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.
[time=402] And they arose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians, and when they were
[time=408] come to the edge of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
[time=413] But the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of
[time=420] horses, even the noise of a great host.
[time=423] And they said one to another, "Lo, the King of Israel, has hired against us the kings
[time=429] of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us.
[time=434] Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and they left their tents and their horses,
[time=441] and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life." And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and did eat and drink, and carried from their silver and gold, and rained and went and hid it,
[time=457] and came again and entered into another tent, and carried from there also, and went and hid it.
[time=463] And when they had said one to another, "We do not well, this day is a day of good tidings,
[time=470] and we held our peace.
[time=472] If we carry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us, now therefore come that
[time=478] we may go and tell the king's household." I have read for you today, 2 Kings, chapter 7, verses 1 through 9.
[time=488] Thank you, Rick, for the clear reading of the Word of God, and now we want to ask you to
[time=494] share with us the musical ministry of our own star Narwhal, and I have the privilege
[time=501] again of sharing with you that she is singing a song that she wrote, and that I understand
[time=507] is going to be a part of an upcoming record that she's working on, for which many are praying, and we trust that God will minister to your hearts now as she sings for us a song entitled "Turn Around."
[time=524] When you've wandered from the Lord, and has loved you, have it more, it's so hard to
[time=536] turn around and go back home to the place where you belong, and it means that you've
[time=549] been wrong, and you wonder if you ever will take you by.
[time=558] Sometimes you wander much too far from your strong protective arms, and you stumble and
[time=569] it hurts along the way, it's a shame that you won't learn, you're his personal concern,
[time=583] and he loves you, and he wants you to come home.
[time=591] So turn around and you'll hear a calling voice that sounds so dear, and it won't take you
[time=602] long until you know, that you've heard that voice before, the day you opened up the door
[time=616] to your heart, and let the Savior enter in.
[time=624] He waits for you, the Lord of light, he'll see you through your darkest night.
[time=633] He loved you then, he loves you now, just call on him, and he'll wash your sins away.
[time=646] Turn your light to brightest day, and you'll be home where you belong, and where you stay.
[time=659] So turn around and you'll hear a calling voice that sounds so dear, and it won't take you
[time=670] long until you know, that you've heard that voice before, the day you opened up the door
[time=685] to your heart, and let the Savior enter in, turn around, won't you please come home.
[time=708] Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour and being a part of this ministry that
[time=721] reaches into the homes of many hundreds of people here in this Greater Fort Wayne area
[time=727] and in the other places where the Bible Hour is seen.
[time=730] We take this opportunity during our offering to sit together and talk with you about the extension of our ministry into your home through the use of printed literature and to share with you announcements of those things which pertain especially to the viewing audience of the Bible Hour television program.
[time=748] My partner in this time together is my partner in life, Donna, my wife, and we share together
[time=755] these thoughts that pertain to you who are part of our television family.
[time=760] Donna, we talk on occasion about the materials that we send.
[time=765] I don't know how many weeks in a row now.
[time=766] This is that we have talked about 4,000 questions and answers on the Bible.
[time=771] We probably almost have enough time to answer every one of the 4,000 questions in this period of time, but I think it's important that we continue to make this tool available because we get so many letters and so many calls from people who are still requesting it.
[time=786] Why don't you share with them basically what is this tool, 4,000 questions and answers on the Bible.
[time=792] This little booklet provides answers on each passage of scripture in order as you go through
[time=798] the scriptures.
[time=799] If you're reading the Bible through, if you keep this book right next to your Bible as you come to a passage and perhaps you don't quite understand what it's saying there, you can look it up in this book and say you're reading an Exodus and you have a question on that passage, you just turn to Exodus in this book and look under that passage and it gives questions and the answers to the problems that are discussed in that passage.
[time=821] When I suppose one of the hard things for most people and study the Bible is the Old Testament, you know, I talk with folks and they say I can handle the New Testament pretty well but I get back in the kings and the chronicles and I get lost.
[time=833] Today in the message I'm going to be speaking from 2 Kings and I just sort of checked out this little book and one of the questions in the passage that I'm speaking on has to do with a king by the name of Ben Hadad.
[time=844] Now most common Americans don't go around talking about King Ben Hadad of Syria, they don't know very much about him and yet when you open this book to 2 Kings and the chapter that I'm preaching about there's a question and there says who is King Ben Hadad and what did he do to the Israelites and it gives a paragraph describing his whole purpose in trying to destroy the Israelites and just puts it all in perspective.
[time=866] That's exciting, I hope you're going to tell us who he is today.
[time=869] Okay, I promise to do that in the message in a few moments.
[time=873] Anyway this is our book that we want to share with you, it's helpful information to get you into the Word and help you understand the portions of Scripture that you're reading.
[time=882] We want to send it to you this week free postage paid is our way of expressing to you our appreciation for your part in the ministry here.
[time=890] Now the way that we do that is first of all by making it available through a telephone number.
[time=896] We have established a toll free number which you may call at any time of the day or night and just ask for the Bible Hour operator, the number to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=909] Tell them that you have been watching the Bible Hour and you would like to have the booklet offered on today's broadcast.
[time=915] And we would encourage you to do that right now, write down the number 1-800-247-2160 and
[time=921] call us today requesting the book 4,000 questions and answers on the Bible.
[time=926] Now before we go back to our service I want to take just a moment to talk with those of you our friends at home and to say a word of encouragement and yet to express a special
[time=936] need that we have at this time.
[time=938] The Bible Hour and its ministry is one of the most exciting things that's happened to us here and from the letters we receive from those many hundreds of people who are at the other end of it, it meets a need in many lives yet we must be honest with you at this time to share with you that the Bible Hour ministry is an expensive ministry and right now at this particular time we are facing some special needs in underwriting the cost of the Bible
[time=964] Hour in the various markets.
[time=966] I only share that with you because we need your help and I know that many of you who appreciate this ministry are capable of helping and want to help if we just express to you that we need you at this time.
[time=978] I'm going to ask that many of you right now sit down and write a letter to me and in that letter express what the Bible Hour is meaning in your life and in your home and if you can
[time=989] enclose a gift to help the cost of the Bible Hour ministry as it reaches out to you every
[time=995] Sunday.
[time=996] At this particular time we especially need to hear from you and I'm going to ask that you share with us in the ministry this week by writing us and enclosing a generous gift
[time=1006] to help in the cost of the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=1009] As long as we can possibly do it we want to continue this ministry but we must hear from many of you this week if we are to be able to continue at the present level reaching out
[time=1020] to share the gospel with the many who hear us each week.
[time=1023] When you write right to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1032] Once again that's post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1037] I hope that we'll hear from many of you this week.
[time=1040] We need to hear from you.
[time=1041] We're praying that God will lay the burden of this television ministry heavy upon your hearts.
[time=1046] Some of you can do much to help us at this time.
[time=1049] May God bless you as you respond to that which God is doing in your heart today.
[time=1067] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=1184] Thank you for that good singing this morning, and you may be seated.
[time=1187] Now as the Black Hawk singers come and minister to us in music, may their prayer be your prayer as they sing what David said when he said, "Restore to me the joy of thy salvation."
[time=1214] [MUSIC]
[time=1224] [MUSIC] Once I had everything [MUSIC] All the joy [MUSIC] Life could bring [MUSIC] Each day I lived [MUSIC] A year to talk with you [MUSIC] Living you loving you [MUSIC] My faith was firm and strong [MUSIC] Learning right, hearing wrong [MUSIC] But now it's not the way it used to be [MUSIC] Something's changed inside of me [MUSIC] Restore to me the joy of my salvation [MUSIC] Restore to me the joy of each new day [MUSIC] Give me back the love that I once heard for you [MUSIC] And never ever let me slip away [MUSIC] I used to speak your words through my lips [MUSIC] Your voice was heard [MUSIC] There were so many [MUSIC] Then who came my way [MUSIC] I could help find the way [MUSIC] But now my words are cold [MUSIC] And joy is gone [MUSIC] Love is old [MUSIC] And though because I tried to feel alone [MUSIC] Bring me back [MUSIC] Take me home [MUSIC] Restore to me the joy of my salvation [MUSIC] Restore to me the joy of each new day [MUSIC] Give me back the love that I once heard for you [MUSIC] And never ever let me slip away [MUSIC] Jesus, how I need you everywhere ♪
[time=1465] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1470] The Spirit of God is saying to some today through the ministry of music who are far from the Lord,
[time=1477] that it is time to turn around and come back to Him, and that it is time for them to pray the prayer of David from the Psalms that God would restore to them not their salvation, but the joy of their salvation.
[time=1492] May the Spirit of God continue to speak in your heart if the music has already addressed itself to your need
[time=1500] as we open our Bibles together again to the Old Testament, and as we look again at this passage of Scripture which Rick read for us a few moments ago,
[time=1510] found in the second book of Kings in the seventh chapter,
[time=1516] 2 Kings chapter 7 and verse 2.
[time=1527] And I'm going to read the ninth verse of the seventh chapter again,
[time=1534] and we will be working in the seventh chapter verses one through nine, looking at a couple of other passages of Scripture.
[time=1542] But verse 9 is the key to our understanding of this message, and will you follow in your Bibles as I read it once more?
[time=1549] Then said the lepers one to another, we do not well.
[time=1553] This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.
[time=1558] If we teary till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us, now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household.
[time=1567] Shall we pray?
[time=1570] Father, speak to us by thy spirit in our hearts from the word.
[time=1579] Cause us not only to hear the word that is spoken, but that word as it is applied and interpreted to our own hearts in light of our present situation,
[time=1591] make it real and strong and straightforward,
[time=1597] cause us to respond to it in obedience, excited to do thy will once we have learned it.
[time=1606] If there are those here who have not known Christ after the manner of personal faith in Him,
[time=1613] we pray that the gospel will be clear, and that the word of hope and the word of faith,
[time=1623] the word that ultimately becomes the word of joy, will find its lodging in their hearts today as well.
[time=1630] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1636] This week I had one of the great joys of my life,
[time=1643] and the opportunity to minister to a young man from Nigeria.
[time=1647] Those of you who were in the Wednesday service heard me share some of the details of that story.
[time=1655] Young man who came here to study, who in his earlier life had heard the word of God from a godly relative,
[time=1664] who had been under the ministry of a missionary, came here to study at one of our local institutions, and on a Sunday had the opportunity to turn the dial to the proper channel,
[time=1678] and heard the word of God as it went forth from this pulpit.
[time=1683] Matthew called my home that afternoon and talked to my wife and said that God had done something very specific in his heart that day, though he was not quite sure what it was.
[time=1694] Later we had an occasion to meet, and this week as we talked together, there was that agreement that took place in his heart between that which he had heard many years ago in his homeland away distant from this place, and the word which he had heard from the ministry of this pulpit, and the word which I shared with him personally, and in his broken English he prayed and received Jesus Christ as his personal Savior.
[time=1724] We talked together of the joy of the gospel and of the opportunity that we have to share it, and I was again made very, very thankful for the missionary movement of this country,
[time=1737] that one day dispatched a missionary to his homeland and shared with him and with his loved ones the good word of glad tidings which they had already discovered.
[time=1751] It seems strange to turn to the Old Testament to find the reality of the introduction I have just given you,
[time=1761] but it is here and it is very powerful and forceful as we understand it.
[time=1767] It finds its place in the historical setting of the Syrian siege of the city of Samaria.
[time=1774] Syria, under the leadership of their great general Benhedad I,
[time=1780] had placed its military armament and its soldiers and all of its military power against the city of Samaria in what was then the most effective means of military warfare, and that was the siege of a city.
[time=1797] All of the entrances and exits of the city had been closed off and were guarded, no food could go in, no Samaritans could come out.
[time=1807] The Syrians were encamped some distance from the city and were very easily, gradually starving the Samaritan people to death.
[time=1820] The record of the sixth chapter of Second Kings is clear as to the tremendous difficulty the Samaritans were facing.
[time=1830] It is almost too horrendous to mention in the pulpit, the Samaritans had become so hungry that they had begun to devour their offspring
[time=1841] and the sixth chapter of Second Kings records an argument between two mothers as to which of their children would be eaten next for self-preservation.
[time=1851] The seventh chapter of the book of Second Kings records the fact that the head of a donkey was being sold for 80 shekels so that it might be eaten.
[time=1863] Need I say, that is not the normal delicacy which you look for when you are hungry.
[time=1869] But they had come to that, they were hungry, the food lines had been cut off and there was no hope and little by little they had begun to starve.
[time=1878] God had told Moses earlier in the twenty-sixth chapter of the book of Leviticus that this is what would happen to his people if they neglected him.
[time=1887] In Leviticus chapter twenty-six verses twenty-seven through twenty-nine we read these words
[time=1893] "And if you will not for all this hearken unto me, and walk contrarian to me, then I will walk contrarian to you also in fury, and I even I will chastise you seven times for your sins, said God to Israel,
[time=1907] and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat,
[time=1913] and I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
[time=1922] And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries into desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors." God had prophesied that if Israel would neglect him as they had, he would certainly bring judgment upon them.
[time=1937] Such judgment so awful, so terrible that it would eventually wait in their devouring their own offspring, and that time had come.
[time=1945] The king of the city of Samaria, with all of his leaders,
[time=1953] were starving to death day by day.
[time=1957] Then God sent Elisha the prophet to bring a word of hope and encouragement,
[time=1963] a word of prophecy, a word, if you will, of salvation.
[time=1969] And his prophecy, his word of salvation, is given in the first part of chapter 7, where we read that Elisha said, "Here ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord, tomorrow about this time, shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria." That seemed like a word of impossibility.
[time=1993] Here they were paying eighty shekels for the head of a donkey, and the prophet comes and he says, "I want to make a prediction, a prophecy, a word from the Lord," and that word is that tomorrow.
[time=2005] In the city of Samaria, which is now under siege and which is starving to death,
[time=2011] you will be able to buy flour for a single shekel.
[time=2017] One who held the king's hand said, "In mocking that word of prophecy,"
[time=2023] he said, "Behold, shall the windows in heaven be opened that this might be,"
[time=2029] and he was making fun of Elisha's word.
[time=2033] Yet as you read the story, you discover how God miraculously did something for the people of Israel, he performed a miracle in their behalf.
[time=2042] The miracle, which is not a part of the main point of this lesson today, is recorded for us in the seventh chapter.
[time=2049] It was something that God did for the people of Israel, quite apart from any of their involvement whatsoever.
[time=2055] The record says in verse 6, "That the Lord made the host of the Syrians who were encamped against the city of Samaria to hear the noise of chariots and horses, even a great noise, and they thought that the king of Israel had hired the Hittite kings against them and destroyed them, and so frightened were they that they arose in the middle of the night from their Syrian encampment, and they fled in the twilight, leaving their tents and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life." So rapid was their evacuation of their encampment that we read in verses 14 and 15,
[time=2094] that when they said after them to determine whether this had actually happened, verse 15 says, "And they went after them unto the Jordan, and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the Syrians had cast away in their haste,
[time=2107] and the messengers returned and told the king.
[time=2110] So quickly had they run, because of that which God had caused them to hear in their ears, which was not the reality of life, so quickly had they run away, that they cast their garments off so that their journey would be lighter and they could get away quicker.
[time=2123] God had done in fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy that which he said he would do.
[time=2130] And that's where our story begins.
[time=2133] For in light of what God had done, there were three reactions to the miracle.
[time=2140] May I say to you that those three reactions are summations.
[time=2145] They are pictures, they're parables or illustrations of the reactions of almost all of mankind
[time=2152] to that which God has done for us in our day.
[time=2157] The three groups or individuals that we consider here are those who were left in the city of Samaria,
[time=2164] four lepers who waited outside of the city, and one man who in unbelief had mocked the word.
[time=2172] Let us think first of all of the city.
[time=2176] That night, as God caused the Syrians to run and the siege to be lifted, gathered in the city of Samaria,
[time=2183] were the men and women who had been under the siege of the Syrian army for all of these days and weeks.
[time=2191] Armed men stood upon the walls, not one of them moved.
[time=2198] Outside the city walls, the Syrian army had retreated.
[time=2203] No longer did they stand at the gates, no longer were the troopers present.
[time=2207] Yet in Samaria, they thought themselves to be prisoners.
[time=2211] Everyone who went to bed in Samaria that night went to bed in bondage, even though they were in reality free men.
[time=2221] They could have been as free as they had been in the wilderness with the right to come and go as please, but in their hearts and in their minds they were prisoners, for they did not know that the Syrian army had retreated.
[time=2233] Their ignorance of what God had done for them kept them prisoners.
[time=2240] Not only had the siege been lifted, but their very enemies had been defeated.
[time=2245] The Syrians had run for their lives because they had heard the noises of horses and chariots.
[time=2251] God had single-handedly performed a miracle and defeated the enemies of the Israelites.
[time=2257] That night the guards who watched in Samaria in the darkness set their watch against a foe that was not there.
[time=2266] They spoke to each other on the wall that night in horse hungry tones that would portray the starving bodies of each of them.
[time=2277] They were guarding the walls against an imaginary foe.
[time=2281] In the city that night the average person who lived in the average home drew his belt about him just a bit more tightly because of the starvation that he had experienced,
[time=2293] hoping against hope that perhaps that night in his sleep he might die and wake up the next morning without the awful pain of hunger that he had experienced.
[time=2302] Yet within a stone's throw of that city was enough food for all of the city to eat so that no one would have had to go to bed hungry, but they did not know it.
[time=2312] They were prisoners of their ignorance, starving in the midst of plenty, crying out when they could have feasted.
[time=2322] Their enemies were gone. It was a strange sight that night in the city of Samaria, a city besieged and yet not besieged.
[time=2332] A city surrounded by enemies, yet not really surrounded by enemies.
[time=2338] Out of all of Samaria, listen now, out of all of Samaria, there was not one person who believed the word of prophecy from Elisha enough so that in the desperation of his own life he might have come down over the wall just to go and see if what Elisha said was true.
[time=2355] Every one of them because of their ignorance of the truth and their unwillingness to believe it had shut themselves up within that city and they would not believe the word of the man of God who had prophesied their recovery.
[time=2370] What a picture, a multitude of people in the last stages of hunger, dropping dead as they pace throughout the city, yet food within sight and within reach.
[time=2383] That was the city of Samaria, but let us now move in our thinking to four individuals who were outside of the city.
[time=2393] For the record tells us that outside of the walls of Samaria were four lepros men at the entrance of the gate.
[time=2401] The description of these men comes to us from all that we know about leprosy in the Bible.
[time=2407] They were living in shanties outside of the gates of the city. They were not permitted within the walls. They were considered unclean and defiled.
[time=2415] They were fed only with the food that was passed over the wall to them from those who lived inside. They were rotting away outside of the wall in the loathsomeness of that awful disease.
[time=2427] This week I read a book that describes the awfulness of leprosy.
[time=2434] Leprosy, if I understand it correctly, is not only the cancerous sores that we often see in the missionary slides, but leprosy is the destruction of the system of pain within the body so that a leper cannot even know when he hurts.
[time=2449] And his body can fall apart and degenerate in all of its rottenness, and he not even know it. Much has been done for that disease in our society and in our generation today, but in that day, those were the despicable characters of the off scouring of society.
[time=2466] And they waited outside the city wall.
[time=2470] You can be sure that when the famine became sore, there was no food coming over the walls regularly.
[time=2476] They sensed in their own life that no man cared for them. These four living skeletons huddled outside of the wall, a picture of all that would happen to those inside given just enough time.
[time=2490] Their families had rejected them.
[time=2494] Yet it was these despicable creatures who were to be the discoveries of what God had done for all of Samaria.
[time=2503] I never cease to be amazed at the illustrations in the Word of God that remind us that God has not chosen the mighty and the rich and the noble, but he has chosen the weak and the unlearned.
[time=2518] Often times that he might reveal himself to them, as he did to the shepherds. As he is often done in the Word of God, recorded concerning the disciples.
[time=2529] The discovery of God's great miracle in behalf of his people was to be discovered that night by four lepers who were starving outside of the city wall.
[time=2539] Someone has written that the chariot of grace often passes by the towers of haughty kings, but stops at the hut of the poor desperate lepers, and that's what happened.
[time=2554] Their desperation is quite clear in the Scripture, for we have their conversation recorded for us.
[time=2560] As the famine was taking its toll of Samaria, they began to reason with one another outside of the walls.
[time=2567] They had come to the conclusion that there was no hope. They had given up on themselves.
[time=2572] They said in essence, "We don't have any option. What do we have to lose?" They had come to the conclusion that they might as well go and give themselves up to the Syrians.
[time=2581] Their logic was quite clear. They knew for sure that if they stayed in their present situation, no more food was coming over the wall. They would certainly die in starvation.
[time=2591] They were not allowed back in the city of Samaria, so that was not an option to them.
[time=2596] And so they reasoned in their desperation, "We might as well go and walk into the camp of the Syrians. We might as well get this over with.
[time=2603] We might as well take our chances with the enemy, as to sit here and let the awfulness of hunger take its toll so that we die."
[time=2611] The Scripture puts it this way. They said, "Why sit we here until we die? If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city."
[time=2620] "And we shall die there. And if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians.
[time=2629] If they save us alive, we shall live. And if they kill us, we shall but die. What have we got to lose? We might as well give ourselves up."
[time=2638] It is quite interesting to me to note that they took the initiative to do something about their condition for a number of reasons.
[time=2645] First of all, obviously, they felt the famine much more intensely than anyone inside of the city.
[time=2650] They would be the last to receive any food, so they were certainly much more hungry than anyone else.
[time=2657] They were at the bottom of their very lives. They felt they had nothing to lose. Everything for them must be up.
[time=2664] They had come to the end of themselves. They had given up hope of life. They said, "Why do we sit here and die?
[time=2669] Let's take our chances. Let's see what might be for us among the Syrians."
[time=2675] They had determined that there was no hope. They had literally given up on themselves.
[time=2682] They had come to the conclusion that they had only one hope in their lives.
[time=2687] That there was only one way open to them, and they determined to walk that way.
[time=2694] I want to pause long enough so that we not take anything for granted in the application of this story.
[time=2701] Those four leopress men speak to those of us who were born into this world with the cancer leopress disease called sin.
[time=2711] We are all men and women who are starving for want of spiritual reality in our lives.
[time=2717] Some of us know it more than others. It is usually that man who has been reduced until he cannot look up to see bottom
[time=2724] that comes to the reality of his need, and it is the reality of that need in his life that causes him to take a step in the direction that is open to him.
[time=2732] Most of us at some time or another, as we have come to that place in our lives, have looked around at the options that are open to us.
[time=2738] And we have come to the conclusion that the Word of God is true when it says, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."
[time=2749] And we have taken the only course of action that is open to us, and we have cast ourselves upon Jesus.
[time=2755] The poet wrote it this way.
[time=2758] They had come to understand their need.
[time=2761] They had come to understand their determination.
[time=2765] They had come to recognize that in the seed of David was their hope.
[time=2772] That is our situation in this generation, and the lepers in that situation look to the city or to the Syrians as their only hope.
[time=2782] I want to talk not only about their description and their desperation, but I want to talk about their discovery.
[time=2790] I like to imagine in the narrative portions of the Scripture what it must have been like for those four starving lepers to come upon the evacuated camp of the Syrians.
[time=2801] The Scripture tells us something about it in verses 5 and 8.
[time=2806] For we read in verse 5 that they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians, and when they were come to the edge of the camp, behold there was no man there.
[time=2818] That must have been a surprise to them.
[time=2821] Their heart was beginning to beat more rapidly as they approached the camp, and then they got to the gate of the camp, and there wasn't anybody there.
[time=2830] Verse 8 says that when those lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent.
[time=2835] They thought something certainly must be wrong.
[time=2838] They could hear the horses stamping in the background, for they were still there.
[time=2842] All of the evidence of livelihood was about them, but they could not hear even one voice of a man.
[time=2849] No soldiers were talking together.
[time=2852] Here and there, the sounds of animal life, but nothing that they could recognize as human.
[time=2857] And then they decided to go into a tent, these four starving lepers.
[time=2861] They opened the flap of the tent, and they walked in there to find a supper that had been prepared for a military family who had left in haste.
[time=2870] I can imagine, spread on the table, the kind of food that the army was used to receiving in those days, plenty of food, all garnished and supplied beautifully.
[time=2881] And the lepers walk in, and they're so hungry, they don't even stop to consider whether anybody around might see them, and they sit down and begin to gorge their hungry throats with that food.
[time=2890] And the scripture says they looked about them to discover not only plenty of food, but silver and gold and all of the riches of the Syrian army.
[time=2900] Immediately they began to think about themselves.
[time=2903] And the scripture says that they took what they could find and went out according to Oriental custom and began to hide it in the earth, burying it in the fragile safe of that day, running back to see what they could find.
[time=2917] And you can almost see their excitement, tired as they are from not eating, and all of the fright of the enemy gone.
[time=2923] They run from tent to tent to see what they can find, and everywhere are the good things of the Syrian army that they're taking to themselves, running out to hide it and coming back.
[time=2932] My would of discovery, that was for those four lepers.
[time=2938] And then we read in the ninth verse that suddenly it dawned upon them that there was something wrong with their activity.
[time=2947] Then they said one to another, "We do not well."
[time=2954] And I would ask of those lepers, "How is it that you do not well? Are you not hungry? Do you not lack for personal good? Have you not come to receive that which is at the very core of your need? How could it be said that you do not well?"
[time=2968] And they answered, "This is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace."
[time=2975] Immediately they began to understand that what they had discovered was not just for themselves, but for others.
[time=2982] That over in that city of Samaria were thousands of people who were starving to death who did not know that the enemy had been defeated, that the siege had been lifted, and that in this city was all of the good things that they lacked in order to live.
[time=2996] And immediately in the midst of the joy of their own personal discovery, having taken for themselves to see that it was real and that it was genuine, they began to think about their responsibility to those in that city that was dying and without hope.
[time=3011] Oh, my brothers and sisters, do you not understand what God would teach us in this parable?
[time=3019] All over Christendom today are men and women who have discovered the beautiful table that God has set for us in the Christian life, who have come to taste and see that the Lord is good, who have taken Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, and all of the attendant benefits,
[time=3038] but have failed to see that in their responsibility of eating and receiving and taking, God has given to them the charge to go to that jonder city and tell them there that their need can be met in Christ.
[time=3055] And I see in churches people sitting around feasting at the banquet table, gorging themselves upon the Word of God, talking about how wonderful the Christian life is, who will not go across the street to tell a lost person about the Savior, and that in Jesus Christ there is the answer to their need.
[time=3073] You mark it down that sooner or later every church determines whether or not they will live for themselves or for others, and I want to say that the closest thing to my heart is a pastor.
[time=3084] The thing that motivates me and gets me up in the morning is the realization that I am a part of that leperous crew that found one day the answer to my need in Jesus Christ, and I cannot sit by gorging myself with all that is mine at the banquet table while over yonder in that city are men and women who are yet to hear.
[time=3102] "We do not well," said the lepers. "This is a day of glad tidings. We must go and tell them, can you imagine the lepers going back to the city?"
[time=3113] And the scripture says they encountered the porter of the walls, the keeper of the walls, and the leper came up to the wall and he hollered with his newfound strength.
[time=3123] "Hey up there, I have good news for you!" And the tired worn out porter of the wall looked down over the edge, and there he saw that old leper that a few days ago he had dropped the last bread crust to.
[time=3142] In his mind he said there's something different about that man. He doesn't look the same. The agony's gone from his face. The sorrow's not on his lips.
[time=3153] He has a ring of reality in his voice. I wonder what's different. Say, are you the one? Yes, I'm the one, but I'm a changed man.
[time=3162] I found something. I'm a different person. My whole life has been changed. Where once I was poverty, now I'm riches. Where once I was hungry, I have been filled to overflowing.
[time=3173] And I want to tell you that what I found you can find if you'll just take my testimony and follow me to where my need was met.
[time=3183] And the scripture says that the porter of the wall went to the porters of the kings and the word quickly spread. It was a word of salvation to a dying city.
[time=3193] It was a word of sustenance to a starving humanity. It was a word of prophecy fulfilled from the lips of the man of God.
[time=3204] No, what a joyous time they had as they found their need to be met. But there is one third man I want you to meet.
[time=3214] We read of him in the second verse of the seventh chapter. He was the Lord on whose hand the king leaned. He was the one who had ridiculed the message of the gospel.
[time=3225] He's the one who said, Elijah your God will never do that. I don't believe this miracle. And Elijah made a prophecy to him. He said someday you will see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.
[time=3239] Will you jump down with me to the 20th verse or to the 18th verse?
[time=3245] And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
[time=3256] And that Lord answered the man of God and said, now behold if the Lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be, and he said, behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shall not eat of it.
[time=3267] And so it fell unto him, for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.
[time=3273] When the word got out that there was plenty of food in Samaria, the king decided to select the Lord who had ridiculed the prophecy to watch the gate of Samaria.
[time=3284] And he went down and stood in the gate of Samaria, and the hungry people trampled him underground. He saw with his eyes, but he did not eat of that which had been provided, because he did not believe.
[time=3300] There will be many in the sound of my voice today who have heard the word of hope for a spiritually starving soul.
[time=3311] You may ridicule it, but you cannot deny it. And if you do not believe, you may see it in others, but you shall never experience it in your own heart.
[time=3324] Shall we pray? Our Father, I want to thank you in the name of Jesus Christ that you have met my need.
[time=3334] I have been at the table. I have tasted and seen that the Lord is good. Oh, what a joy it is to run.

[time=3512] With heads bowed and eyes closed, I wonder how many in the congregation this morning would say, "Pastor David, I don't believe I've ever trusted Christ as my Savior. I don't believe I've ever accepted Him into my life. Ask Him to be my personal Savior, but I want you to pray for me because I need to do that.
[time=3534] I want you just to slip up your hand if that's your need today. By the upper raised hand, I'll know that God has spoken to you in your heart and I'll pray with you. Yes, thank you. You may put it down.
[time=3544] Yes, I see your hand, someone else, upstairs in the mezzanine. God has spoken to my heart today, preacher. I don't know that I'm saved.
[time=3564] I don't know that I'm saved.
[time=3594] God has spoken to you in your heart and I'll know that I'm saved.
