[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=14] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=20] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geroma.
[time=25] [MUSIC]
[time=37] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=43] That's mighty good singing.
[time=45] We welcome those who are joining us now by television and sharing this service, the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=53] We are suffering in our nation from that which someone has described as payday paranoia.
[time=60] Materialism, which is eating its way into the lives of even the godliest of Christians.
[time=69] All of this is happening while at the same time 94% of the world's population is dying to hear.
[time=77] The message of the Lord Jesus Christ, and here in our own country there are many who have never yet heard a clear presentation of the Gospel message.
[time=86] These are sobering thoughts for the Christian, and thoughts which cry out for an answer from God's perspective.
[time=94] A few moments were going to open our Bibles to the book of 1 Timothy in the 6th chapter,
[time=100] where Paul writing to the young pastor of the Ephesian Church says some very pointed things to the men and women of his day,
[time=109] which find application in our day as well.
[time=113] First we have some music to share with you, and our choir has chosen a theme of the future for today's ministry in choral music.
[time=122] It is the song that we shall sing as the redeemed in heaven.
[time=126] The book of Revelation tells us that there is coming a time in the future when led by the four and twenty elders,
[time=134] we shall sing around the throne worthy, O Lord, art thou to receive glory and honor.
[time=141] For thou has created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
[time=148] The choir shares the theme with us this morning, "Worthy is the Lamb."
[time=156] "Worthy is the Lamb that was saved.
[time=188] Worthy is the Lamb that was sent to receive.
[time=200] Awer and riches, and we'll come and save.
[time=209] Honor, glory, and blessing.
[time=216] Worthy is the Lamb.
[time=224] Worthy is the Lamb that was saved.
[time=233] Worthy is the Lamb.
[time=254] Worthy is the Lamb that was saved.
[time=270] Worthy is the Lamb that was sent to receive.
[time=282] Awer and riches, and we'll come and save.
[time=290] Honor, glory, and blessing.
[time=298] Worthy is the Lamb.
[time=306] Worthy is the Lamb that was saved.
[time=314] Worthy is the Lamb.
[time=344] Jesus Christ, the very God of very gods, is the Lamb who was slain and today he is worthy
[time=352] to receive our praise, even as we read his word.
[time=356] Jesus Christ spoke in Matthew, the sixth chapter, the 31st verse with these words.
[time=362] Therefore, take no thought saying, "What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or where with all shall we be clothed."
[time=373] For after these things do the Gentiles seek.
[time=377] For your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.
[time=382] But seek ye first, the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
[time=390] Take therefore no thought for tomorrow, for tomorrow shall take thought of the things of itself.
[time=398] Efficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
[time=402] I've read for you today, Matthew chapter 6 verses 31 through 34.
[time=412] Thank you, Rick, for the reading of the Scripture.
[time=415] We're going to listen now to the Men's Singers Quartet as they sing for us a song entitled, "I Want to Be There When They Crown Him King of Kings." The regular bass singer of the Men's Singers is away this weekend.
[time=429] In our versatile and talented minister of music is now the bass in the Men's Singers Quartet.
[time=434] I know you'll enjoy and appreciate this spiritual.
[time=437] I want to be there when they crown Him King of Kings.
[time=441] Sunday with the clouds of life are over, and the saints are caught away.
[time=450] We will gather round the throne of Jesus for His Coronation Day.
[time=458] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=462] I want to be there when the card of heaven rings.
[time=466] When the happy song the angel chorus sings.
[time=470] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=475] All the universe will be assembled, nonetheless together in there.
[time=484] Angel Holson, all the ranks of Darmie.
[time=488] For you sight beyond compare.
[time=491] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=495] I want to be there when the card of heaven rings.
[time=500] When the happy song the angel chorus sings.
[time=504] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=512] Only those who put their faith in Jesus.
[time=522] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=532] I want to be there when the card of heaven rings.
[time=543] When the happy song the angel chorus sings.
[time=553] I want to be there when we crown Him King of Kings.
[time=571] Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour, and especially for sharing these moments of special interest to our many friends at home.
[time=580] After last week's Bible Hour special, it's good to get back into the routine and to share with you this particular program which I know will be of great blessing to you.
[time=590] Just a few moments I'm going to be preaching on the subject of laying hold on eternal life.
[time=595] And it fits in with all of the things we've been talking about recently on the Bible Hour.
[time=599] I hope your Bibles will be available to you and we'll be looking at the book of 1 Timothy to discuss this topic together.
[time=606] As always Donna is with me and we want to share with you today some continued news about a special project
[time=613] which we're involved in at this present time.
[time=615] Donna last week we spent a whole hour telling our friends about the importance of the Founders Club.
[time=621] We've heard from many of them already and it's been a great encouragement.
[time=624] But we still have a long way to go if we're going to reach the goal of doubling our Founders Club for the purpose of stabilizing this television ministry.
[time=632] And I'm sure there are many who are watching today who did not have the opportunity of seeing last week's special ministry.
[time=638] So maybe it would be a good idea if you could give them a thumbnail sketch of the Founders Club so they know what we're talking about.
[time=644] The Founders Club is made up of a number of people who have committed themselves to regularly
[time=650] support the Bible Hour.
[time=652] We have discovered that unless we have a number of people who systematically, regularly send in a contribution
[time=658] to help us, there's no way we can stay on the air.
[time=661] And many times it's just the small contributions of ten, fifteen or twenty dollars a month that make the difference of whether or not we can continue.
[time=670] Donna I think a lot of times people wonder why we have to get people involved with us financially that way.
[time=676] There's sort of a paradox that I think comes to the minds of many people.
[time=681] There are folks that have expressed to me this way.
[time=684] Why if that church is on television it must be because it has a great deal of money.
[time=689] And I always smile at that because every week we are right at the very edge of having enough
[time=695] to cover the cost of television.
[time=697] And our church is not capable of underwriting this ministry at its fullest extent.
[time=702] A great deal of the help at the beginning came from the church.
[time=705] But as you know, we're involved in an expansion program and so the television ministry rests very heavily
[time=711] upon the people who are the recipients of its ministry.
[time=714] And I just believe with all my heart that watching this program today are hundreds of people who believe in and appreciate the Bible hour and its sensible approach to television programming,
[time=726] to its biblical ministry, to its quality music, to its ministry in the homes of shut-in people.
[time=733] And I just know there are folks who believe in that I meet them often.
[time=736] And of course the Founders Club program is an attempt on our part to get those people who really believe in what we're doing to join with us in enabling us to continue to do it.
[time=746] We also like the opportunity of ministering to that core group of people in a specific way.
[time=753] How do we do that?
[time=754] We don't like for this to be a one-way street where you're doing everything for us and we want to have an opportunity to encourage you and to help you spiritually at the same time.
[time=763] One method of doing this is we would send to you two booklets each month which are a study guide on the Bible.
[time=770] My husband writes these each month.
[time=772] It's on a particular book of the Bible.
[time=774] We've gone through Timothy and Corinthians and Romans.
[time=777] And we mail these out to you each month and it has a portion of Scripture for you to read and a number of questions for you to answer on each portion of Scripture that you have read.
[time=787] There's also an encouragement to pray and a memory verse for you to work on each week.
[time=793] And I think that these things as we send them to you can be a real encouragement to you in your own spiritual life.
[time=799] And that's just a way of extending our ministry on a daily basis into the lives of all of our Founders Club people.
[time=805] We also send out a monthly newsletter specifically written to each Founders Club member.
[time=810] We mail out a monthly watch word which is a motto, attractively put together on a folded card stand so that you can put it on your desk or over your sink in the kitchen.
[time=821] And those who are involved to the tune of $15 a month or more in the support of this ministry
[time=828] receive a special leather bound Bible hour edition of the Scriptures with their name engraved on the front.
[time=834] It is a beautiful Bible.
[time=836] Many of our people have them here and all of them have shared with me how much they love this Scripture.
[time=842] Now, we want you to be a part of the Founders Club ministry and we sense that many of you want to be a part.
[time=848] Here's how you do it.
[time=849] Go to your phone right now and dial this number.
[time=852] Dial 1-800-247-2160.
[time=856] When the operator answers tell her that you would like to enroll in the Founders Club and that you would like to make a commitment to give 10, 15, 25, 50 whatever God lays upon your heart.
[time=867] Each month to the Founders Club ministry supporting the Bible hour in its outreach.
[time=872] Every dime that you give to the Founders Club ministry goes directly into television to extend this program back into your home and into the homes of others.
[time=881] Once again, Donna, the number is?
[time=883] The number to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=889] And this is a toll-free number, no cost to you.
[time=892] We also want to encourage you if you'd rather write to write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250-Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=900] The simplest and most direct method, however, is right now for you to go to your phone.
[time=905] Dial 1-800-247-2160.
[time=909] Tell the Bible hour operator that you'd like to enroll in the Founders Club, tell her what you would like to send each month, and immediately we'll begin to send you these items that we've talked about, and you can be a part of extending the ministry of the gospel into the homes of many hundreds of people.
[time=925] We're believing God for a great increase in the underwriting of this program during these next days, and I'm trusting that you will want to be a part of it.
[time=934] The number that you call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=940] Why not do it right now?
[time=943] Him number 51 is our next song.
[time=957] It's a hymn of assurance.
[time=959] The songwriter called it Blessed Assurance.
[time=962] Jesus is his mind. Him number 51 in our song books.
[time=966] Shall we stand together now as we sing?
[time=992] Hallelujah!
[time=999] Jesus is our first song.
[time=1018] Jesus is our last.
[time=1048] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=1079] ♪ Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1083] During these next days, we will be entering into the
[time=1095] wonderful season of the year, when first of all we give thanksgiving, and then when we will be sharing the joy of our Savior's birth into this world.
[time=1106] One of the highlights every year at the Black Hawk Baptist Church is the presentation of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1115] Already plans have been put into motion and preparations are being made, and within just a few short days we will be announcing the dates and reservation procedure.
[time=1128] I'd like to request that you pray for this presentation this year.
[time=1132] There will be more people here during those days than we ever have in the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1138] Many of our friends who share this ministry out in other places will be driving to be with us, and we're trusting first of all that God will give us good weather and a great opportunity to reach out and touch the lives of many people.
[time=1152] Now before the message this morning, we're going to hear a message in song by one of the members of the Black Hawk Singers, Mr. David Miller.
[time=1161] [MUSIC]
[time=1177] All to Jesus I surrender
[time=1186] All to Jesus I freely give
[time=1193] I will ever love and serve Him
[time=1205] In His presence I'll daily live
[time=1216] I surrender all
[time=1231] All to be my blessed Savior
[time=1240] I surrender all
[time=1246] All to Jesus I surrender
[time=1259] Lord I give myself to thee
[time=1269] Give me with thy love and power
[time=1279] In thy presence forever be
[time=1287] I surrender all
[time=1307] All to be my blessed Savior
[time=1315] I surrender all
[time=1323] All to be my blessed Savior
[time=1332] I surrender all
[time=1346] All to be my blessed Savior
[time=1362] Thank you, David.
[time=1364] Will you open your Bibles with me now to the book of 1 Timothy I'm the sixth chapter, 1 Timothy chapter 6, and I want to read 1 Timothy chapter 6, beginning at verse 3.
[time=1376] 1 Timothy chapter 6, beginning at verse 3.
[time=1385] You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine, and if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and disputes of words of which come with envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions, perverse disputings of men, corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness from such withdrawal thyself.
[time=1416] But godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=1420] For we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
[time=1424] And having food and raiment let us therewith be content.
[time=1428] But they that will be rich fall in a temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition, for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some covet it after,
[time=1444] they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
[time=1450] Shall we pray together?
[time=1453] Lord in heaven we thank You for the direct, straightforward, unadulterated truth of the word of God which breaks through the barriers which we set up humanly,
[time=1467] tears away the facade, gets down to the very heart of each one of us to expose those areas of our life which are not in conformity to the will of God.
[time=1479] Father today it is quite possible that we could read this portion of Scripture and each of us assign its meaning to someone else.
[time=1488] And yet if we were to view this instruction to our hearts in light of a world
[time=1494] that is dying without hope and without God and without Christ, a world that lacks the gospel to a large measure because there is not enough
[time=1505] available to send it forth, then each of us can apply this passage to our own hearts,
[time=1511] make application to our lives, and it is that Father which we desire today.
[time=1517] Open up our spirits to receive the truth that the Spirit of God would deliver to us,
[time=1523] give us attentive hearts and minds, help us Father to want to understand your word so that we might obey its truth in Jesus' name and for its sake. Amen.
[time=1535] John Wesley, the great Methodist leader, was known throughout this country
[time=1544] for his zeal in evangelism and especially at one time during his ministry for his
[time=1551] ability to preach and teach upon the subject of stewardship.
[time=1556] Wesley had a tremendous message on stewardship which became quite famous
[time=1562] wherever he went. It was a very simple message with only three points.
[time=1568] One time he was preaching his famous sermon and his first point was "earn all you can."
[time=1577] An old miser sitting in the congregation nudged his neighbor and whispered, "I never heard preaching like that before. That's great, isn't it?" He said. Wesley went on to his second point and he said, "The second point in my sermon is save all you can." Well, the miser rubbed his hands together, listened with an attentive spirit.
[time=1599] All he was excited. He said, "This is the best preaching I've heard in years.
[time=1603] Earn all you can, save all you can." Wesley saved his strongest point for the last and he said thirdly, "I want to share with you that the most important thing is to give all you can."
[time=1618] The old miser was beside himself with despair. He said, "Oh, now he's done gone and ruined the whole thing." I have a feeling that there are a lot of folks who are Christians who feel that they have made their way about stewardship. They like the idea of earning all they can and many of them give themselves to it.
[time=1637] They think it's tremendous to save all they can and their bank accounts are filled with that which they have earned.
[time=1645] But let somebody stand up and talk about giving all they can and they've gone to meddling from their preaching.
[time=1653] You know, the Bible has a great deal to say about what we do with our money.
[time=1657] Most of it has not so much to do with actions as it has to do with attitudes.
[time=1662] It is not addressed to those who have a great deal of money, but it is addressed to all of us wherever we may be in the economic strat of life and the words are strong and straightforward.
[time=1674] Paul writing this letter to Timothy, his young son in the faith, who now was pastoring the church in Ephesus, wrote to him warning him against the men who were preaching and teaching
[time=1690] and bringing an instruction in the city of Ephesus and were doing it for the wrong reasons.
[time=1696] This chapter, the sixth chapter has much to say about false teachers and those who were mercenary in their teaching ministry.
[time=1704] Paul describes to young Timothy that they ought to be careful to avoid such as for their dangerous men.
[time=1712] But on the heels of his instruction concerning false teachers, he adds this section about materialism, which is perhaps the strongest material we have in the New Testament for men and women who live in our culture today.
[time=1727] It could have been written in 1978 to the men and women of this congregation
[time=1733] or most other congregations here in the United States.
[time=1736] It is an exposé of the materialistic philosophy of our world.
[time=1741] It is a warning to Christians not to be caught up in it, not to let it grasp them in its clutch.
[time=1748] And it is a strong deterrent for any who will hear its words and follow its instruction.
[time=1756] Paul, in this passage of Scripture, sets forth for us what happens to a Christian who gets caught up in the money game.
[time=1764] Unless you think that is superfluous for our day and age, you just need to look about and discover that there are many Christians, men and women who know and love the Lord Jesus Christ, who have gotten on the tram of economic superiority along with the rest of the world and its fledglings.
[time=1783] Men and women who are consumed with one passion and that is to earn all that they can and can all they earn.
[time=1791] It is their determination that they are going to be rich in this life and somehow they have lost perspective.
[time=1798] I want you to notice that the thesis of this text found twice, both in verse 12 and again in verse 19, is that as Christians, you and I are to be consumed with one passion and that is to lay hold upon eternal life.
[time=1812] That does not mean we are to reach out to secure it for as Christians we already have it, but it does mean that we are to reach out to grasp hold of eternal life and all of its values and all that it means to us and make eternal life real to us every single day as the one motivating factor for which we live.
[time=1832] Paul warned Jung Timothy that certain things happen to men when they get caught up in the materialistic pursuit of the age.
[time=1841] The first thing he tells them is this, that a man who becomes a materialist as a Christian expects his faith to pay him dividends.
[time=1850] There is a very interesting verse which begins our discussion today from the sixth chapter.
[time=1858] At the end of verse 5, as he has described the false teachers, Paul writes this, that these individuals are destitute of the truth and they suppose that gain is godliness.
[time=1872] Now in the text and in the language in which the Scripture was written, it would be better to translate that phrase exactly reverse as it is found here, supposing that godliness is gain.
[time=1885] Paul here is talking about some men who went about becoming involved in religion because they felt that it was economically rewarding to them. They were in the religion money game.
[time=1897] They were out to reap dividends for themselves.
[time=1900] They thought godliness was gain, that they could become something financially that they were not by their involvement in the religious world of their day.
[time=1909] And Paul wrote to Timothy, he said, "You watch out for those men.
[time=1913] If they're in it to make money because of their godly involvement, you watch out for them, they're dangerous men.
[time=1919] If Paul were alive today, he would have figured out a stronger way to say what he said in this passage.
[time=1925] The extravagant extortioners who are wrapping themselves up in the cloak of religion today and fleecing people for everything they are worth, for their own personal gain and involvement and growth financially, we could write a book about it.
[time=1945] You cannot turn on the television or the radio without running into them.
[time=1949] They are out to get from being godly.
[time=1952] And yet the scripture says these men are not godly at all.
[time=1956] The Bible says that one of the dangers that we face as Christians, if we get caught up in the money game, is that we begin to expect a dividend back to us from our faith.
[time=1966] And men and women, even Christians in a Bible believing fundamental Baptist church can get caught up in that.
[time=1972] It usually expresses itself in the philosophy that I give to the church because in doing so, I get a great deal back from God.
[time=1981] You cannot out give God the big shovel, little shovel syndrome.
[time=1985] You know all about that.
[time=1987] And I believe that generally speaking, that is a good principle if we understand it right, but I want to say to you this morning that if the only purpose we have in being involved in the stewardship of a local church is because it enhances our financial portfolio, then we're giving for the wrong reason and we fall into the case of materialism that's given to us in this book.
[time=2006] We ought to give to God out of our heart that is flowing for love for Him, not because in giving we get.
[time=2013] Now it is true that when God notices one of His stewards and He reasons in His mind that that steward is capable of handling what He has entrusted to Him, it is quite often the case that God will entrust more to Him and He becomes a steward of more and more.
[time=2030] But mark it down in your book.
[time=2032] God is not in the trading business with His people.
[time=2035] And He does not say to us, "You give to me with the express purpose that I will give back to you." He does promise us that if we're faithful in what we give, He will reward us with the opportunity of being a steward of more.
[time=2048] But it is a tremendous temptation in Bible believing, Bible teaching churches where stewardship has been taught from the ground up, for men and women to get caught up even in spiritual things with a materialistic philosophy which says, "I will give to the church so that I can get something back." He says in His Word, "You need to be careful that you don't look at godliness as a means of gain." That's one of the steps in becoming a materialist.
[time=2077] But will you notice, secondly in this text, that a man who becomes materialistic in his philosophy and determines to get all that he can in this life and pursues riches as a goal in his own life, this man not only expects his faith to pay dividends, but this man exempts himself from God's system of reward.
[time=2096] Will you notice that in the text, we read these words, "But godliness with contentment is great gain." And then again in verse 8, "And having food and raiment led us therewith be content." Now let me ask you something, men and women, what is it that God wants to do for you and for me in this world, in the here and now, in the present tense, not pie in the sky, buy and buy, but right now, what is it that God wants to do for you and for me in this life through the resources that he has entrusted to our care, what is it that God wants to reap upon us as we walk with him each day?
[time=2137] And I want to say to you that the one benefit that God wants each of us to enjoy is the benefit of contentment.
[time=2144] Contentment.
[time=2146] Isn't it interesting that in our culture and in our world, we spend all of our health to get our wealth.
[time=2156] And then we end up spending all of our wealth to try to get our health back.
[time=2161] Isn't that true?
[time=2163] Men who are growing up in the system of economics of our world give themselves to the pursuit of riches and they work night and day, morning, night, noon, into the midnight hours.
[time=2174] They run in a fast track and you can't keep up with them.
[time=2177] They neglect their bodies and they spend their health to get their wealth and then they spend the last years of their life spending all their wealth trying to get their health back.
[time=2185] And they think that that's what the life we live is all about.
[time=2189] The Bible says that God wants you and He wants me to come to a place in our lives where we understand what it means to be content.
[time=2197] And the Scripture says that godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=2203] In other words, if you are godly and content in your godliness, that is great gain.
[time=2210] That's what God wants for you and for me.
[time=2213] God's reward for the Christian in this world is contentment.
[time=2217] And a man who gets caught up in the money trap will miss it because it's the old adage how much money is enough, just a little bit more.
[time=2225] How rich is rich enough, just a little bit wealthier than I am.
[time=2229] A man who lives to amass riches will never be satisfied.
[time=2233] He will never be content because his life is one long pursuit for the dollar that's a little bit beyond the dollar he now has.
[time=2242] I've always appreciated what Paul wrote in his letter to the Philippians.
[time=2246] He said, "I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content." Paul wrote that in jail.
[time=2254] Paul wrote that to a group of Philippian believers as he languished in the jail at Philippi and he said, "I can be content in jail." Paul wrote that having experienced all of those things which are recorded of him in the book of Corinthians, he went through all kinds of deprivations in his own life.
[time=2270] And yet Paul said, "I've achieved God's plan for my life." I am content.
[time=2276] And I've learned that wherever I am, because I take the Lord Jesus Christ with me and he's the joy of my life, I can be happy in content.
[time=2282] I believe that's the goal.
[time=2284] God sets before every Christian contentment.
[time=2287] Over in the book of Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 5, we read these words.
[time=2292] "Let your manner of life be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have." For he hath said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." Contentment.
[time=2307] Over in the book of Proverbs and the 30th chapter verses 8 and 9, there are some Proverbs attributed to a man by the name of Agure.
[time=2316] And one of his Proverbs is very interesting.
[time=2318] Listen to it.
[time=2319] You don't have time to look for it, but listen to it.
[time=2321] Proverbs chapter 30, verses 8 and 9.
[time=2323] And it says this, "Two things have I required of thee, deny them not to me before I die." And here's his request, "Lord, give me not poverty nor riches.
[time=2334] Feed me with food that is convenient.
[time=2338] Lest I be full and deny thee and say, "Who is the Lord?"
[time=2345] Or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of God in vain.
[time=2349] Now, there was a man who knew how to pray the right kind of prayer.
[time=2353] He wasn't like the materialist of our generation who said, "Lord, give me more, more, more and more." But he said, "Lord, I understand the danger that's involved in the amassing of riches.
[time=2363] And Lord, give me that which is convenient for me, that which I can handle.
[time=2367] Because I don't want too much.
[time=2369] If I get too much, I'll forget that you're God and that everything comes back to you.
[time=2373] And Lord, I need enough so that I'm not poor and tempted to cut corners to get what I need to survive.
[time=2380] I've never yet heard a Christian pray that kind of prayer.
[time=2384] I've met a lot of Christians who should have prayed it.
[time=2389] Contentment.
[time=2390] You know the word "contentment" in the book of 1 Timothy is a word which means "sufficiency." In fact, this same word "contentment" in 1 Timothy chapter 6 is found over in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 8.
[time=2406] And in that verse it is translated by the word "sufficiency." Having all "sufficiency" in all things.
[time=2415] That's the same word that's translated "contentment" here.
[time=2418] What does it mean to be content?
[time=2420] Well, the word "contentment" means to have sufficient in yourself, to be sufficient within yourself and not discounting the Lord's ministry, but to have "sufficiency" that is self-sufficient.
[time=2433] And what it really means is this.
[time=2435] It is sufficient without comparing yourself to anyone else.
[time=2439] It means that you don't get caught up in the game of saying, "Well, they've got something bigger and better than I do, so I'm not content anymore.
[time=2446] I've got to be like them." The word "contentment" means that your contentment is according to the standards that God gives you for your life, not according to the standards of somebody over here or somebody over there.
[time=2458] So many Christians are all caught up in the fact that they have to keep rising in the economic strat of their day because the Joneses have this and they have that and their cars bigger and better and their televisions brighter and all of the rest.
[time=2473] That's not contentment.
[time=2475] Contentment is the kind of thing that says, "I have what God has given me.
[time=2479] I'm grateful to him for it.
[time=2481] I thank him for his provision for my need.
[time=2483] And Joe over here may have more and Sally over here may have more, but God's given me that which is convenient for me.
[time=2489] And I graciously give him thanks for his provision.
[time=2492] That's contentment.
[time=2493] The story is told of an old Quaker who put a sign out on his farm.
[time=2498] A sign said this, "I will give this farm to any man who is completely contented."
[time=2505] One day a fellow came up and knocked on his door and he said, "I saw your sign and I came to pick up your farm." He said, "Are you completely contented?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Then what do you want with my farm?" [laughter] Good point, isn't it?
[time=2522] Contentment is being satisfied with what God has given you.
[time=2526] Contentment is being satisfied that he knows what you're able to take care of and he gives you that.
[time=2531] And as you give of yourself in good stewardship, demonstrate your ability to control what he has given to you, he entrusts you with more.
[time=2540] Contentment.
[time=2542] And I want you to notice that this matter of God's reward for us in the Christian life is that we be contented.
[time=2549] Have you ever said, "Lord, make the goal of my life that I will learn what it means to be content with what you give me and how you allow me to live?" That's what it's all about.
[time=2560] I read recently of a manufacturer over in Taiwan who employed some of the natives of that culture to work in his factory.
[time=2571] And they worked hard to earn the money, but they had very few wants and needs.
[time=2577] And so the problem the manufacturer was getting into was that the men would only come in and they'd work four or five hours until they'd earned what they need, then they'd go home.
[time=2584] They didn't want to work anymore.
[time=2585] They had just what they need.
[time=2587] And he labored over that problem.
[time=2588] Finally, he came up with a solution.
[time=2590] You know what he did?
[time=2591] He mailed a Sears catalog to every single one of them and they all came back to work and wanted over time.
[time=2597] Right?
[time=2598] Why?
[time=2599] They were content till they found out there were some other things they'd have, and then when they found all of these things, they became restless and wanted more.
[time=2610] How much like that?
[time=2612] So many of us are.
[time=2614] God wants us to understand that a materialist faces some problems.
[time=2619] First of all, he expects his faith to pay him dividends.
[time=2622] He thinks godliness is gained.
[time=2623] Secondly, he exempts himself from God's reward.
[time=2626] He automatically wipes out the opportunity for God to give him contentment.
[time=2631] You know the scripture says he's to be content with food and clothing.
[time=2634] And the word clothing there is a word which means coverings.
[time=2638] And it is a word which could be described as that which shelters us.
[time=2642] Not only our clothing, but our home.
[time=2644] And the scripture, in essence, is saying if you've got enough to eat in a place to live, then thank the Lord, you ought to be content.
[time=2650] He's provided your needs.
[time=2653] That is contentment.
[time=2654] And I want you to notice, thirdly, that a man who gives himself to a materialistic pursuit in this life exchanges this life for the next.
[time=2664] There is a very common and off quoted axiom found in the seventh verse of 1 Timothy 6,
[time=2670] and it reads like this, "For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out." All of us believe that.
[time=2679] We've been around long enough to believe that.
[time=2682] What is the apostle trying to point out here?
[time=2685] He's trying to say that we live for such a short time what we have materially only last
[time=2691] for the few years that were on this earth.
[time=2693] We didn't bring any of it in.
[time=2694] We're not going to take any of it out.
[time=2696] So it's kind of foolish to spend all your years trying to amass what you can't take with you when you leave.
[time=2702] The real point that the apostle is trying to get across here is this.
[time=2706] That material possessions, now listen, are equally as important or irrelevant
[time=2712] at our exit out of the world as they are at our entrance into the world.
[time=2718] Material possessions are as meaningful to us when we leave as they were when we came into the world.
[time=2725] You know, I have a little boy who hasn't been in the world a long time.
[time=2729] I could give him $10 and wouldn't make a bit of difference to him.
[time=2733] You know what he does with money?
[time=2735] We leave it laying on the floor, he tries to eat it.
[time=2739] Money means nothing to him.
[time=2741] He could care less about it.
[time=2743] Why?
[time=2744] It has no meaning to him.
[time=2746] And you know something when that little boy grows up and he goes to his deathbed and he dies when he leaves this world.
[time=2751] He'll have exactly the same meaning.
[time=2753] And it just destroys my concept of understanding when I see men and women who know that and believe it
[time=2759] and yet will live their lives and involve themselves in every ounce of energy that God gives them
[time=2765] to pursue something that's not going to be one wit worth to them when they walk out of this life and they'll spend themselves for it and they'll walk out of this life without one bit of it and leave their relatives to fight over what's left.
[time=2778] And what they're doing is simply exchanging the life to come for this life.
[time=2783] There's a couple of good words here in contrast to that.
[time=2788] Two phrases.
[time=2790] It says, verse 12, "Men and women lay hold on eternal life."
[time=2796] Again, verse 19, as Paul instructs Timothy concerning the rich man, he says, "Lay hold on eternal life."
[time=2805] You have a choice open to you as Christians.
[time=2808] One is to pursue that which you can't take with you and to give yourself to it and spend yourself to get it.
[time=2815] And then as you get it, continue to multiply it and get more and more and hoard it.
[time=2819] That's laying hold of this life and there are some who will do that and they'll do it well.
[time=2824] I know some men who I've met in my lifetime who have laid hold of this world and they've got it in their grasp and they've got all the world has to offer them.
[time=2833] There isn't anything without which they have to do. They can get anything they want.
[time=2837] They've got a hold of this world.
[time=2839] But that is not the goal for the Christian.
[time=2842] The goal for the Christian is to lay hold of eternal life and to ask God to help him to understand the virtues
[time=2849] and the principles of spirituality which are in this book and to lay hold of those principles and men and women, you cannot become a spiritual Christian if every ounce of your energy is wrapped up
[time=2860] in trying to become the richest person on your block.
[time=2863] You cannot, at one and the same time, lay hold of this world and lay hold of eternal life.
[time=2869] It's quite impossible.
[time=2871] It's a pity to see men and women who know and love the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=2878] who talk fondly of the days that they will spend with him in eternity who look forward to seeing his face and yet during the days of this life give of every energy that God entrusts to them to mass riches for themselves.
[time=2893] The most dangerous product of a man who gives himself to materialism
[time=2901] is fourthly that he embarks upon a journey of no return.
[time=2905] He starts out, he embarks upon a journey of no return.
[time=2908] Notice what it says in verse 9, "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition." Now let me point out first of all that this verse is not addressed to people who are already rich.
[time=2925] Over in the 17th verse, Paul has some things to say to those who are wealthy.
[time=2931] It is not a sin to be wealthy and Paul gives them some instruction so that they can handle it properly.
[time=2937] It is not wrong to have done well and to invested properly and to be able to say, "I have gotten something of this world's goods." The problem is when this world's goods get you and you become the servant of their pursuit.
[time=2951] And that's why in this verse, verse 9 it says, "But they that will be rich.
[time=2956] They that give themselves to the pursuit of becoming rich.
[time=2960] They that live for the purpose of wealth.
[time=2963] They that will be rich as the goal of their life." Then the Scripture has some things to say about them.
[time=2973] These are men and women who leave behind all moderate desires and make a definite goal of riches.
[time=2980] These are men who say, "My life, my whole pursuit in this world is that I will be rich and they give themselves to it." Paul says there are certain things you can expect will happen if that's the case.
[time=2993] First of all, there is the lure that you must look out for.
[time=2999] It says, "They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare."
[time=3005] A man who determines that his goal in life is to become wealthy.
[time=3009] First of all, he is lured into that by the temptation and the snare of devil.
[time=3014] The word snare in the New Testament is always used in association with Satan.
[time=3019] In the New Testament, wherever that word is found, it is associated with Satan.
[time=3023] It is Satan's trap for the Christian to get him caught up in the money game.
[time=3028] Then he has no time for church, no time for prayer meeting, no time for witnessing, no time to serve the Lord as God has given him energy.
[time=3035] If Satan catches him in that trap, he has caught him.
[time=3038] He has snared him and he has redirected his life away from the things of God.
[time=3042] The first step downward is the lure.
[time=3044] Secondly, is the lust.
[time=3046] Notice what it says, "They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and to many foolish and hurtful lusts." The Scripture says that when a man gives himself to making money, it's a lust that he cannot satisfy.
[time=3061] He keeps buying more and more and the more he gets, the more he wants.
[time=3065] It's a trip here and a trip there.
[time=3067] This car, that car, cottage is boats, everything you can think of and it's just one thing after another because he is caught up in a satisfiable passion for things.
[time=3076] That's the second step.
[time=3078] The third step is that ultimately he is lost.
[time=3080] Notice the graphic language of the writer.
[time=3083] He says, "They fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[time=3089] which drowned men in destruction and perdition.
[time=3093] It is the picture of a man who has been caught up in a massing well so that he may heap its benefits upon himself and the picture is of a man who is just overwhelmed by the pursuit of this like a man drowning in the sea.
[time=3106] All around him are the things that he's trying to do to get more wealthy and it just sort of covers him up.
[time=3111] And the Scripture says he is drowned in destruction and in sorrow.
[time=3117] He is drowned in destruction and in sorrow.
[time=3122] And those two last words in the text are words which describe an irretrievable loss.
[time=3127] He is set out upon a course from which he cannot return.
[time=3130] He is embarked upon a journey of no return.
[time=3133] There is a line I know not where, that a man crosses over in his determination as a Christian to live for riches and when he crosses over that line he cannot come back for he has so programmed his life never again to see it caught up in the beauty of the things of God.
[time=3151] But godliness and contentment are to be great gain.
[time=3156] Then lastly will you notice what the Scripture says in verse 10 that a man who so directs his life in the pursuit of this world's goods airs from the faith.
[time=3168] Notice it isn't money that causes him to do that, it is the love of money.
[time=3172] He is looked upon as a helpless dupe who has led astray, but all of a sudden the Scripture says he has erred from the faith and he pierces himself through with many sorrows.
[time=3184] It is not possible for you to be a Christian and to live your life for the values of this world and be happy.
[time=3194] The only way you can be happy as a Christian is if you trust God to enable you to do well in what you do so that you in turn can put that back into circulation for the purpose of winning lost men and women to Christ and furthering the kingdom of God and laying hold upon eternal life.
[time=3210] Paul wrote to Timothy that those who were rich were to be given to doing good, willing to distribute, ready to share, laying up a good foundation for the future, he said, laying hold of eternal life.
[time=3222] Oh, how we need to learn that.
[time=3224] As we face these next days in our church and the together we build program all of us are grappling with the issues of this life as opposed to the next.
[time=3232] As I hear you talking about the things God is speaking to you about, I recognize that some of you are right here in this passage trying to figure out what God would say to you about your involvement in laying hold of eternal life.
[time=3243] Just a few days ago on a Sunday evening I talked to you about the importance of having a positive attitude, the importance of having a proper spirit.
[time=3252] In fact, it was a Sunday night when I mentioned to you that I didn't want you to watch your watches but to listen.
[time=3258] I got a letter this morning from a young man in our congregation, a little boy, just able to write legibly and this is what he wrote to me.
[time=3267] I tell you God couldn't have sent me a message from heaven any more potent than this one about the message I've shared with you today.
[time=3275] He said, "Dear Pastor Jeremiah, three Sundays ago in the evening service you told us to put our watches away and listen, and I listened.
[time=3283] I really listened. I listened about some people who grumble all the time no matter what goes on. On Tuesday after that Sunday my dad, my mom, and I had family devotions.
[time=3295] And this is what was on for that night. The subject was, "Are you grumbling?" I wanted you to have a copy of our devotional story and he sent me a copy of the book.
[time=3305] And in the book there was a story of a man who grumbled because he didn't have this and he didn't have that and he didn't have the rest.
[time=3311] A little boy goes on to write, "I want you to know that mom and dad and me live on Thanksgiving Avenue.
[time=3319] We pray and talk a lot about our church. We get excited about what the new auditorium will look like and where it will be. I just want you to know we're not living on Grumbling Street. We're living on Thanksgiving Avenue.
[time=3331] And I happen to know that that family has had some serious financial reverses in the last year. I happen to know that they've gone through some terrible difficulties and yet they've learned the lesson of what it means to be content.
[time=3343] I want to ask you this morning, are you living on Thanksgiving Avenue?
[time=3347] Have you come to the place in your own spiritual life where you can say, "Preacher, you've given me what I have and I'm content with it and I want to invest my life and that which he's given to me and lay hold on eternal life and make this investment for the things of God in the days that are ahead.
[time=3363] Shall we pray?" Father, we thank you for the apt illustration.

[time=3509] Speaking for Pastor David Jeremiah this is Jack Gray inviting you to join us next week at the same time for of a Sunday morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3521] The Bible hour has been made possible by the members of the Founders Club. The Founders Club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach ministry.
[time=3537] Yes thank you I see your hand. Someone else.
[time=3541] Preacher if I were to stand before God today I don't know what I would say for my life. I don't know if I'd have an entrance into heaven.
[time=3549] I'm not sure I've ever put my trust in Jesus Christ as my personal Savior would you pray with me? Anyone else before we pray?
