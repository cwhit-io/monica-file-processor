[time=18] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=29] We are in the midst of one of the most exciting times in the history of our church here at Black Hawk.
[time=38] As we are anticipating another step of faith and growth as we reach into the lives of many more people in this area, we have called our program during this time together we build involving the commitment of all of the families of this church as we band together and take a step of faith to make possible the opportunity of touching many more people with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=62] The theme for these days has been the following, not equal gifts, but equal sacrifice.
[time=70] And many of us have come to grips with a term that we have not been familiar with in the past, the term sacrifice, what does it mean?
[time=78] Today we're going to look into the scriptures to learn from the one who taught us what sacrifice was all about and look at the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, as the example in sacrificial giving.
[time=94] And I trust that your heart will be prepared as we anticipate the blessing of the Word of God today by the wonderful musical program that has been planned for this time.
[time=104] We're so excited to welcome back to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, a friend who has been here in the past, Mr. Johnny Hall.
[time=111] He is a very gifted young man that God has blessed with a wonderful musical talent.
[time=117] And we're excited to share with you now the ministry of our sanctuary choir, and Johnny Hall, as they sing for us a song written by Andre Crouch entitled "My Tribute."
[time=143] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=323] - As our choir and our guest, Mr. Hall,
[time=331] have sang for us the greatness of our God, we can get a glimpse of the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made to make that glory possible, and Philippians the second chapter, verses five through eight, and I would like to read those for you now.
[time=347] Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men.
[time=370] And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death upon a cross.
[time=381] The death of Jesus Christ is recorded by the Apostle Paul in Philippians chapter two, verses five through eight.
[time=388] - Thank you, Rick.
[time=393] I suppose that it may not always be evident to people who are part of our service, that on occasion, we have a little anxiety here, and many times that's my fault.
[time=406] I just have to admit that.
[time=407] Now, what happened here a few moments ago was that the choir and Johnny Hall were supposed to sing now, and John was going to sing a solo first, but that's not the way we normally do it, and I didn't read it too carefully.
[time=419] So if you saw some people moving about with haste, it was because and they adjusted so well.
[time=425] Wasn't that a beautiful song?
[time=427] [AMEN] Now we're going to hear John sing.
[time=431] I trust the Lord will minister to your heart as he shares this number with us.
[time=435] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=612] We thank you for sharing the Bible our with us today.
[time=623] Donna, my wife, and I enjoy this special time that we have to spend with you at home.
[time=630] And it is such a convenient thing because they're receiving the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and it gives us an opportunity to step aside and communicate very personally with our many friends at home.
[time=641] Now, just a few days ago, I wrote a letter to all of those who are on our mailing list and many of you have already received that letter describing our determination to increase the Founders Club enrollment and to add a number of people to the support group that make the Bible our possible to the many homes that depend upon it so heavily.
[time=665] Donna, what is the Founders Club?
[time=667] The Founders Club has made up a group of people who have committed themselves to financially support the Bible our on a regular basis.
[time=676] We appreciate the occasional large gift of several hundred dollars that we might receive, but actually, it's the small contributions of five, ten, fifteen, twenty dollars a month that keep us on the year.
[time=687] Absolutely true.
[time=688] If it were not for the people who consistently give a regular amount each month, there would be no possibility of establishing a Bible our budget.
[time=695] There would be no way of seeing this television program go forward week by week.
[time=700] And that's why each individual family that gets involved in the Founders Club program is such an important part to this ministry.
[time=708] Now, the Founders Club is not a one-way street.
[time=711] Obviously, you receive every week the ministry of the Bible our, but those who become a part of the Founders Club are also the recipients of some very wonderful gifts, some on a regular basis and some one-time gifts.
[time=722] For those who give a fifteen-dollar-a-month commitment, we send a very beautiful leather-bound edition of the Scripture with your name embossed on the front cover.
[time=731] It is a large print Bible, and it has all of the Scriptures as well as maps and helps that will be a real treasure in your home.
[time=739] This Bible, the clear word edition of the Scripture, is the gift that goes to everyone who supports the Bible our ministry regularly for fifteen dollars a month.
[time=749] And then, Donna, very quickly share with them some of the other premiums that are sent out to those who support us on a regular, ongoing basis.
[time=757] I think probably my favorite is the two study guide books that we send out each month to everyone who supports the Bible our.
[time=765] And this offers you an opportunity to have regular, systematic Bible study.
[time=770] It has a passage of Scripture for you to read and questions on that passage to make you think about what you've read.
[time=776] And I think that would be my favorite part that we send out to our friends.
[time=781] Another part of this concept is we mail out a letter to you each month keeping you informed of what's happening on the Bible our and keeping you up to date.
[time=790] Donna, those things are just automatically sent to all of our Founders Club families.
[time=794] The Bible study book is not available anyplace else in the United States.
[time=797] It's something that we have written specifically for them.
[time=800] The letter is from my desk to every family each month describing the inner workings of the Bible hour and its outreach.
[time=807] Along with that, we have just begun to send out to our families a watchword, a little card with a biblical motto that can be used to testify for Christ
[time=817] or to encourage your heart on a regular basis.
[time=819] And a different watchword motto is mailed out each month to the Founders Club members.
[time=823] And then, of course, the other Bible study aids on a spasmodic basis.
[time=828] We send out special gifts to our Founders Club in just a few days.
[time=831] They'll be receiving the latest edition of a book that I just finished.
[time=835] And these are things that we like to do for those who have helped us as a way of saying thank you to them.
[time=843] If you're interested in becoming a part of the Founders Club, we'd like to ask you to take the time right now to call us at 1-800-247-2160
[time=852] and tell the operator that you would like to join the Founders Club.
[time=856] You may enroll in the Founders Club for an amount of $5 a month, $10, $15.
[time=861] Some are giving $25 and $50 a month as God lays that burden upon their heart.
[time=866] Once again, if you want to be a part of the Founders Club, we ask you to go to your phone and what is the number?
[time=872] The number to call again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=878] And another means that you may communicate with us, of course, is by mail.
[time=881] And we love to hear from you in the mail, and it offers us a more direct two-way conversation
[time=887] when we hear from you in the mail.
[time=889] And if you would like to write to us this week, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=898] The zip code is 46815.
[time=902] Donna, once again, let's leave them with the number because most of the people will more than likely call since it's easier.
[time=908] The number to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=912] We'd like to hear from you this week.
[time=914] It would be a great encouragement if many hundreds of our listeners on today's telecast would call us.
[time=919] Why not call us right now?
[time=935] John, he's going to come back and sing for us again, and I know that you'll listen as he ministers to us.
[time=941] We've had such a great week here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=944] It's been a busy time.
[time=945] In fact, I can't remember when we've ever had more banquets together.
[time=950] We had a banquet on Monday night, another one on Tuesday.
[time=953] We took time out of eating for prayer meeting on Wednesday.
[time=956] We had a school banquet on Thursday, and then months ago we had made plans to drive up to Chicago where the Black Hawk singers and I were together in ministering to the Greater Chicago Sunday School Association banquet.
[time=969] So we had another one on Saturday.
[time=971] This week some folks saw me out running around the block doing my jogging and they said, "Are you trying to lose weight, Pastor?" I said, "No, I'm just trying to keep from gaining anymore." And I guess in this time of rejoicing, we have to keep working at that as well.
[time=985] These are great days, and it's just a thrill to know that we serve a God who loves us and is meeting our need as we join together in serving Him.
[time=993] We listen to John as he sings and prepares our heart for the message.
[time=1018] We'll save the rich like me.
[time=1026] I once was lost, oh, but now I am alone.
[time=1042] I was blind, but now I sing.
[time=1052] And it was grace, grace that taught my heart to feel.
[time=1065] And that same grace, my fears, really.
[time=1075] How precious did that grace appeared?
[time=1088] The hour I first believed.
[time=1099] Through many dangers, all of life's toys and slaves.
[time=1108] I have already come.
[time=1117] And it was grace, God's grace that brought me safe.
[time=1124] Oh, save the sky, God's grace is gonna leave me home.
[time=1135] And when we've been there 10,000 years, bright shining as the sun.
[time=1153] And when we've known no last days to sing, to sing our God's praise,
[time=1164] and when we first begun.
[time=1183] Amen, God's amazing grace. Can you say amen to that this morning, my friends?
[time=1188] Amen. How about a little louder so they can hear over the television?
[time=1193] Amen. Oh, that's great. Okay, God's amazing grace has changed my life and I trust his amazing grace has changed yours too.
[time=1203] And for all of you listening out there, I trust it's true for you, God's amazing grace.
[time=1211] One of these days, the Bible tells us that all those who know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are gonna go home.
[time=1221] Now, I don't know what a home was like for you, but home for me is just totally different.
[time=1225] I mean, you know, when you drive down that last road and you make that last turn, and then you finally hold up into the driveway, the car just feels different, you know?
[time=1234] Or if you're walking home, the sidewalk doesn't feel like cement.
[time=1238] It just, you know, when you turn that last corner, it just feels like sponge rubbery, you know what I mean?
[time=1243] You're going home. And you walk inside and, oh, it smells different.
[time=1247] Now, I've been in some other people's homes and they don't smell like my home.
[time=1251] I mean, they smell good, but smells like home to them, but don't smell like home to me.
[time=1255] My home's got a particular smell.
[time=1258] You know, Jesus said, I'm going away.
[time=1262] I'm going away to prepare a place, but not just any old place.
[time=1266] I'm going away to prepare a home for you, man.
[time=1269] And it's gonna smell right.
[time=1271] And when you turn that last corner of life, it's gonna feel right.
[time=1275] And if you walk, if you drive, I don't know where the angels are gonna come along and a buggy cart and take me up, or however it's gonna happen.
[time=1282] But whatever it is, it's gonna feel like going home.
[time=1285] Because I'm going home.
[time=1287] We used to sing a little chorus in Sunday school.
[time=1290] I went something like this. I always want to sing a little verse for you so you get it.
[time=1294] This world is not my home.
[time=1297] I'm just passing through.
[time=1299] It's my treasures there later, somewhere beyond the blue.
[time=1304] Oh, the angels backing me from heaven's open door.
[time=1308] And I can't feel that hole in this world and heart.
[time=1313] Oh, Lord, you know, I have no friend like you.
[time=1317] And if that's not my home, then Lord, what will I do?
[time=1321] Oh, the angels backing me from heaven's open door.
[time=1326] And I can't feel that hole in this world anymore.
[time=1334] One of these days, my friends, we who know Jesus, are gonna be truly, ultimately, finally home.
[time=1351] When in half by the terror of tempestuacy, and unknown ways before you roll.
[time=1366] At the end of doubt and peril, all there's eternity.
[time=1374] Though fear and conflict sees your soul.
[time=1384] Oh, but just think stepping on shore and finding it heaven.
[time=1395] I'll touch in a hand and find in it God's.
[time=1401] I'll breathe in you and find in it celestial.
[time=1410] I'll wake it up in glory and find in it.
[time=1423] Oh, when surrounded by the blackness of the darkest night.
[time=1437] Oh, how lonely, how lonely death must be.
[time=1445] At the end of this long tunnel, there's a shining light.
[time=1453] Oh, death is swallowed up in victory.
[time=1462] Oh, just think stepping on shore and finding it heaven.
[time=1474] I'll touch in a hand and find in it God's.
[time=1480] I'll breathe in you and find in it celestial.
[time=1491] I'll wake it up in glory and find in it home.
[time=1517] Thank you, John, last night in the home of one of our families.
[time=1523] I shared that wonderful truth with a dear man who had just lost his wife.
[time=1529] And I don't know if Harry Bennett and his family are sharing this hour with us today, but if they are, that is just an underlining of what we talked about last night.
[time=1540] And the realization that Betty is with the Lord, and that she has experienced what we just heard a few moments ago, and it's been a real experience.
[time=1549] Take your Bibles, will you?
[time=1551] Turn with me to the book of 2 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians 8, and I want to read one verse, just one verse in 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=1568] 2 Corinthians 8, and verse 9.
[time=1573] All of our Bibles open. I want you to join me in reading this verse, and I want us to read it out loud together.
[time=1580] And I'm reading from the King James Version. If you have something different in that, you catch as many words as you can, and let's read together.
[time=1587] 2 Corinthians 8, and verse 9, let's read, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
[time=1606] Let us pray.
[time=1608] Father, as we again review, the one who has taught us to give, we ask that you will help us not to put it in the realm of unreality, or to spiritualize away the truth of what our Savior did for us.
[time=1625] Lord, that we might not forget that He is our example, that you have sent Him into this world not only to save us from our sins, but to leave us an example that we should follow.
[time=1637] We bear His very name as we call ourselves Christians.
[time=1641] We recognize that we are not truly living the Christian life unless we live it after Christ.
[time=1648] In some measure today, we pray that you will communicate by your spirit to us through the life of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, the love, the grace, the mercy that has been extended to each one of us.
[time=1663] And we pray that in Jesus' name, our Savior's wonderful name.
[time=1668] [AMEN] In this day, as we move together as a congregation for the purpose of finding God's will in our life, we have been talking about the phrase, not equal gifts, but equal sacrifice.
[time=1687] In talking about this with others who have been involved in the discussions about our ministry and the program of sacrifice, it has come to me that we are all grappling with the term.
[time=1700] What does it mean to sacrifice?
[time=1703] We are not accustomed to that.
[time=1705] Most of us have never even crossed the threshold of the meaning and understanding of that term.
[time=1711] And we have tried to explain it in our own human terms to one another, and some have said it's this and others have said it's that, and we have tried to grapple with its meaning.
[time=1721] I found myself this week reaching up to the bookshelf and pulling down the dictionary and looking up the word sacrifice.
[time=1727] I said maybe we're taking something for granted here that we really don't come to grips with what this term really means.
[time=1733] And I read these words. First of all, that the word sacrifice is a word which is coined in the English language from a Latin word, a sacrophysmium.
[time=1743] It is a word which actually is a religious term.
[time=1747] It is a word which means to make something holy by dedicating it to a deity.
[time=1753] It is a word which means to take something which is normal and natural, the stuff of life, and in a very special way to give that over to God and to commit it to God and to set it apart to Him.
[time=1767] One of the other definitions in the dictionary reads this way.
[time=1770] The destruction or the surrender of some desirable thing in behalf of a higher power.
[time=1778] The destruction or the surrender of some desirable thing in behalf of a higher power and in our understanding in behalf of God.
[time=1787] During these days we've been hearing testimonies from our people, little by little as they have been coming to grips with what God would have them to do in giving to this ministry and to its outreach,
[time=1797] and to the lost and needy men and women who need to hear the gospel.
[time=1801] Not too long ago a woman stood up in our congregation and said that God had been dealing with her about a dream, the dream of owning her own home, and she had sacrificed that dream to Him.
[time=1813] Last week at a school banquet one of the men who does not even attend this church but has some children in our school gave one of the most stirring testimonies we have ever heard in this building.
[time=1825] He shared how God has put His hand upon His life and committed Him for the sake of the education of His children to sacrifice many things including a new Buick that He just bought and He traded down to a lower economically operated car.
[time=1839] And in humor He said it was a great sacrifice but the other car didn't ride very well and He was going to be reminded of His sacrifice every place He went during these next years.
[time=1849] Another had shared with us just a few moments ago before this service was shared with those at home that God had put His hand upon a place where they spent many wonderful hours in the summer, a summer home, and a new boat and some other things.
[time=1864] And little by little we're beginning to understand that sacrifice is taking that which is desirable to us and giving it up in behalf of a higher power.
[time=1873] I was reminded again this week as I studied the scripture that in all of our commitment and all of our delving into the principle of sacrifice we have yet to even come close to understanding the term as it was lived out and personified in the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior
[time=1893] For our text says that He for our sakes became poor that we might be made rich. Now how is it that the scripture can say that Jesus Christ gave up something for us.
[time=1906] I recognize that we could go in many directions and trying to describe and to detail that principle but let me just share some of the things which may not be quite so obvious.
[time=1916] Have you ever stopped to think about the fact that the Son of God became poor first of all and that He gave up His residence of glory to come down and walk upon this earth and become the Savior of lost men and women.
[time=1928] Over in the book of Luke chapter 9 verses 57 and 58 we read that it came to pass as they went on the way that a certain man said unto Jesus Lord I will follow thee with her so ever thou goest.
[time=1944] Jesus put up His hands as if to qualify His commitment and He said before you do that let me remind you of something and then He quoted this verse.
[time=1953] He said foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not wear to lay his head.
[time=1963] And when I think of that verse and I remember what the scripture tells me of the beauty of His home in heaven and I realize that for those 33 years he gave up he sacrificed.
[time=1974] He divested himself of the opportunity of the beauty of his home and he came here to walk upon this earth and the scripture says there is nowhere that he could lay his head that he could call his own.
[time=1985] He pillowed his head often upon the back of a boat as his disciples moved out across the Sea of Galilee. His entrance into humanity was marked by the poverty which he took upon himself for the scripture says that when Mary brought forth her son Jesus she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, the clothing of poverty.
[time=2006] And she placed him in a manger because there was no room for him in the inn. The son of God the ruler of the universe gave up all of the glories of heaven and his entrance into humanity was marked by being rejected in the very common place of residence in the city where he was born.
[time=2026] Now when I understand that I cannot come to grips with what it means unless I again go back to examine what it was that he left. What did he give up?
[time=2036] You know whenever we try to describe heaven and I've been asked to do that for people on many occasions. Can you tell me what heaven is like?
[time=2044] I seem to have the same problem that the biblical writers had as they tried to describe the beauty of a place so indescribable that human terms are not available to adorn its beauty.
[time=2057] It seems as if every description and every illusion to the father's house is one of surpassing beauty. It is as if the biblical writer such as John the revelator who wrote the book of Revelation ransacked the universe to convey something of the beauty of that place which God had allowed him to see in a glimpse.
[time=2077] Just to know something of the glories of heaven which Christ renounced when he came. We get just a glimpse of that as we look in our Bibles at the book of Revelation chapter 21. There we have a description of the beautiful city, the prototype of heaven that which will be ours and it says this about that place.
[time=2095] It describes it in these terms and the building of the wall of it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like under clear glass and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones and the 12 gates were 12 pearls and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass.
[time=2118] You say, preacher, do you believe that's the genuine description of the place called heaven? Oh, I do. I believe that that's just the best that a man can do to describe its beauty, that it's far more than that. That's just bring brought down into human terms so that we can understand heaven at least a little bit in our finite minds.
[time=2138] Someone said, Pastor, why didn't God give us more detailed description of the place where we'll spend eternity? And I've often said, if we knew all that heaven was, we'd be so heavenly minded, we'd be no earthly good. I believe that with all my heart.
[time=2150] Heaven is a place which is beyond description and it was that place and the realm of that glory and the residents in fellowship with his father that Jesus Christ left and he came down to this earth to walk among men and the scripture said he did it for our sakes.
[time=2166] He became poor, that we might become rich. One of the Christmas hymns that we sing and we ought to sing and more often it just at Christmas because they tell the story of the incarnation of the Savior. One of the verses of this Christmas hymn goes like this.
[time=2183] The foxes found rest and the birds their nest in the shade of the forest tree, but thy couch was the sod, O thou son of God in the deserts of Galilee.
[time=2198] That's what Jesus did. He gave up his residence of glory. Another songwriter tried to put it in terms like this. He said out of the ivory palaces into a world of woe, only his great eternal love.
[time=2212] Made my Savior go. I can't even begin to describe to you what the Savior sacrificed when He left heaven to come to this earth.
[time=2221] We know something of the beauty of the world in which He has placed us in the world that He's created. Most of us can point our fingers at some of the most beautiful spots in this world.
[time=2231] May I say to you today that the most beautiful place you've ever been in this created world of God. The place that you look upon is the most beautiful place in all of the world.
[time=2241] It's not a match for that which is in heaven. This past year, my wife and I had the privilege to travel to Europe and to go to see the city of Jerusalem.
[time=2254] And as a part of our tour, we went to Rome. And I shall never forget, as the end of the tour drew near, we went down into a place called Naples, the Bay of Naples.
[time=2263] And we stood upon a high hill and looked out over that beautiful bay. And I said to my wife, "There isn't any place in all of the world that could be more beautiful than this."
[time=2272] And then I was struck with the reality that that's just the finger play of God in relationship to that place called heaven, where the Savior dwelt and where those who are blood bought are bound.
[time=2284] That's what he left. He gave up his residence in glory. And he came and he walked among men, the poorest of poor, born in a cradle, destined for the cross. He did that. He sacrificed that for me and for you.
[time=2300] But then I'm reminded of the fact that not only did he give up his residence of glory, but he gave up his realm of power.
[time=2307] The Scripture over in Matthew chapter 26 and verse 43 tells us of an incident in our Lord's life as he was coming down to the end of his existence here on this earth before his death.
[time=2319] In the account of his resurrection, of his arrest, we find in Matthew chapter 26, and I want you to read along with me in this passage of Scripture, Matthew chapter 26 verse 53.
[time=2333] This is what Jesus said when he was about to be arrested, and I want you to catch the impact of the verse.
[time=2341] Jesus said this to those who would arrest him, an earshot of those who knew and loved him.
[time=2346] He said, "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels."
[time=2358] That verse of Scripture is just a little bit of a glimpse into the potential realm of power of the Savior, the Son of God.
[time=2367] A realm which he left behind as he came down here and he condescended to be a man.
[time=2373] Putting himself in the submission to his Father, he walked among men and he divested himself of the independent use of his attributes, including the independent use of the realm of his power.
[time=2385] And the Scripture said that although that potential was there, he could have called all of the angels to his rescue.
[time=2391] He gave that up to come and become a part of our humanity and to go to the cross.
[time=2396] I don't think we can come to grips with what that meant for the Lord Jesus Christ until we understand what it was that he held in his hand as his power.
[time=2405] In heaven, in the place where our Savior dwelt, for him to desire was commensurate with his having.
[time=2415] If he would just think, "I want," it would be his.
[time=2418] His thoughts brought into being whatever it was that he will.
[time=2423] He could say to the light, "Light be," and light would fill the world.
[time=2428] He could say to the oceans, "Oceans be in existence and the world would be filled with the beauty of the waterways."
[time=2437] The Scripture says not anything was created that was not created by him.
[time=2441] By him all things are created and by the very word of his mouth and the will of his mind, he could bring into existence all things that represent wealth and beauty to us.
[time=2452] Hear him speak if you would from his throne in glory.
[time=2455] He says, "If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the cattle on a thousand hills are mine."
[time=2461] He said, "The treasures of the gold are mine, the pearls which have never been reached by the deepest divers, those are mine.
[time=2470] Go up to the highest heaven and look around, and everything you see belongs to him.
[time=2475] Go down into the bowels of the earth, and all that's there was created for and by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2482] Go east until it becomes west, and you won't pass anything on the way that the Savior hasn't created.
[time=2488] Go west until it becomes east and the same is true.
[time=2491] All of the world and all of its realm is that which belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2497] He brought it into being. It is his.
[time=2500] If he pleased, he could have spoken a world into existence.
[time=2506] At the will of his mind, millions of angels could have appeared.
[time=2510] And yet the Scripture says he condescended to leave that realm and come and live like an ordinary man because he loved you and he loved me.
[time=2521] He sacrificed all of that.
[time=2523] In fact, as you continue on in Matthew chapter 26 and verse 54, you read that when he described the power that was at his disposal,
[time=2532] he said, "I could do all of this. I could call the legions of angels into existence, but how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled."
[time=2541] In other words, if I were to take control of this realm of power that is mine, how would man ever be redeemed?
[time=2548] Throughout his life from the very beginning of his ministry until he one day went to the cross. Satan tempted him to take back into his control.
[time=2555] That which was his by right and by nature. He took him one day out into the desert as is recorded in the fourth of Matthew.
[time=2562] And he said to the Lord Jesus Christ, "Command these stones that they be made bread." And then again he said, "If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, he shall give his angels charge concerning thee,
[time=2575] and in their hands they shall bear the uplast at any time thou dashed thy foot against a stone." And again he took him to the high mountain and he showed him the kingdoms of the world.
[time=2585] And he promised that he would give him the control of all of that. What was he doing? Satan was just acknowledging the realm of power that was the Lord's.
[time=2593] And he was tempting the Lord to take back to himself that which he had sacrificed to come and become a man.
[time=2599] And the Lord said, "Get thee behind me, Satan." And then he quoted to him the Old Testament Scriptures.
[time=2605] And then we come to the New Testament and we come to the end of his life and he's hanging upon the cross.
[time=2610] And as if by a way of just taunting him to the last moment of his life concerning the realm of power which he had given up.
[time=2618] The Scripture says that those who stood by him and hung next to him on the cross said, "If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
[time=2625] In other words, take that realm of power back to yourself.
[time=2629] And Jesus refused to do it and he was faithful to the end and he continued to hang upon that cross until every drop of blood was shed
[time=2637] to purchase your redemption in mind because he cared enough to sacrifice the realm of his power.
[time=2645] Turn in your Bibles to the book of Philippians. Turn in your Bibles to the book of Philippians chapter 2.
[time=2652] Let me share with you finally that not only did he give up the residence of his glory and the realm of his power,
[time=2660] but the Scripture says he gave up his reputation. He gave up his reputation.
[time=2665] Someone has written that he left us the cradle to show us how God came down to man.
[time=2672] He left us the cross to show us how man can get up to God.
[time=2678] And in the getting up to God is the self-renunciation, the kenosis passage which Rick read for us a few moments ago telling us
[time=2686] what exactly Jesus Christ sacrificed for us.
[time=2690] I want you to follow in your Bibles as we think through this passage as to what it meant for Jesus Christ to give up his reputation.
[time=2697] We read in chapter 2, these words let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
[time=2703] who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man.
[time=2718] He humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
[time=2724] Let me share with you two or three things that it meant to the Lord Jesus Christ for him to lose his reputation,
[time=2730] to give up his reputation, to be made of no reputation.
[time=2734] First of all, it meant for him an attitude of selflessness.
[time=2738] Verses 6 and 7 remind us that Jesus Christ was in the form of God, a word which means that he was the very existence of God.
[time=2747] It's the word morphe and it is not the description of an outward appearance of a being.
[time=2752] It is the description of the internal being himself.
[time=2756] Jesus Christ was God.
[time=2759] He was God and the word being in that text is a word which means he had continued to be in existence throughout all eternity,
[time=2766] the God who was pre-existence, the Christ who was God himself.
[time=2770] This is what he was and he had every right to be self-centered about it because he was existence personified.
[time=2777] But the Scripture says that Christ who was in the form of God did not cling to the privileges associated with that.
[time=2785] But he voluntarily divested himself of the independent use of the attributes that were associated with his deity.
[time=2793] He did not give up his deity, make sure of that.
[time=2796] He did not cease to become God.
[time=2798] But all of those outward privileges that were his because of who he was, he voluntarily set those aside.
[time=2805] He put them on the shelf for 33 years and he came down here to walk among men and to experience hunger and pain and sorrow and agony
[time=2814] and all of the emotions which you and I have known in our lifetime.
[time=2818] He did that.
[time=2819] He was a selfless one.
[time=2821] It meant to be selfless for him.
[time=2824] But notice on in the Scripture that it meant an attitude of servants.
[time=2828] The Scripture says that he came being in the form of God and not thinking it robbery to be equal with God.
[time=2835] And he made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant.
[time=2841] And in our minds eye we see both the picture of the king of glory in all of his regal regalia.
[time=2848] And at the same time we see the son of man donning the servants clothing and kneeling next to his disciples to wash their feet as a common servant.
[time=2859] The Scripture says he took upon himself the form of a servant in the words of his mouth from Luke 22.
[time=2865] He said, "I am among you as one that serve it. When they tried to put him upon the throne here on this earth."
[time=2872] He said, "Wait a minute. I want you to understand what I'm all about.
[time=2875] I have not come to be ministered unto but to minister to serve and give my life a ransom for many."
[time=2882] He became a servant.
[time=2885] Not only did he become a servant, not only did the loss of his reputation mean that he became selfless and that he became a servant.
[time=2892] But the Scripture goes on to tell us that it meant absolute submission to the will of God.
[time=2897] He made himself of no reputation and he took upon him the form of a servant and he was made in the lightness of men.
[time=2904] And being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death.
[time=2911] He humbled himself the self humiliation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2916] Many times in our lives we are humbled by the circumstances around us or by others who may humiliate us.
[time=2924] But the Scripture says that Jesus humbled himself. He humiliated himself and he became obedient.
[time=2931] John chapter 6 verse 38 records the words of our Savior when he said, "I came to do the will of him that sent me." The book of Hebrew is the writer says in chapter 5 verses 8 and 9, "Though he were a son, yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered.
[time=2952] For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many are made righteous or shall be made righteous."
[time=2960] Jesus Christ came to submit himself to the will of the Father and he walked upon his earth in a spirit of humility humbly doing the will of God in heaven.
[time=2970] If you were to say to Christ upon his earthly journey, do this or do that.
[time=2975] He had it within his power to do it, but he would always pause to look up to the will of his Father and say, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me." Some have asked me why it was that Jesus went out into the garden of Gethsemane and there waited long hours at night in prayer before his Father.
[time=2991] It was simply because he had determined before he came into this world to give up the independent use of his attributes and to submit himself to the will of his Father in heaven.
[time=3001] And as men and women today wait to know God's will, Jesus Christ waited in Gethsemane and out in the garden to know the will of his Father
[time=3010] because he was willing to be like us that he might redeem us from our sin. It meant obedience.
[time=3018] And I want you to notice that not only did it mean submission, but the epitomeate of it all, the point at which all sacrifice ultimately turns,
[time=3030] the mountaintop experience of the understanding of the word sacrifice is found in the last words of this verse,
[time=3037] and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross,
[time=3047] even the death of the cruel treatment of the cross which symbolized the awfulest of crimes in the Roman economy.
[time=3056] He hung one day, stretched out upon that cruel wood, and died the most awful death known to men at that time.
[time=3064] And he hung there until every bit of life was drained out of him. He was obedient, even unto death.
[time=3072] Now I want you to remember again what the verse says in 2 Corinthians 8.
[time=3077] 2 Corinthians 8 says, "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, have you glimpsed just a bit of the wealth that was at his disposal,
[time=3089] though he was rich, yet he became poor." Now don't forget to underline in your Bibles, men and women, that it was for your sakes,
[time=3100] for your sakes, for my sake. I can read that verse, "For I know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich,
[time=3110] yet for the sake of the salvation of David Jeremiah, he became poor, that I, through his poverty, might be rich."
[time=3120] There are two kinds of poverty, a poverty that is never known riches, and a poverty that has come after wealth.
[time=3131] Go down to the burials of the most difficult city, down to the skid row of the major metropolitan areas,
[time=3141] and you will find there the off scouring of humanity.
[time=3144] Men and women who have never known what it was like to sit at a table, spread with a tablecloth, and to eat the common foods which we take for granted.
[time=3152] Some who have been in the awful bonds of poverty all of their lives, and that is a sadness.
[time=3159] But there is a greater sadness than that. Go to that same area, and if you hunt long enough, you will find a man who one day was in the aristocracy of his society,
[time=3168] who walked among kings and presidents, and who lived at the greatest level known to man today, who knew and enjoyed all of the wealth that is possible in humanity.
[time=3179] But somehow, perhaps through drink, somehow, perhaps through the terrible tragedies of life, he was brought lower and lower and lower until he was at the very bottom of life.
[time=3188] And I ask you what kind of poverty is the worst.
[time=3191] The man who has never known the wealth that was possible, or the man who having known it was brought to the very bottom.
[time=3198] I'm sure you can understand with that simple illustration that the poverty of the Lord Jesus Christ can only be understood in light of the great wealth that was his.
[time=3206] He became like you and me. He did it for my sake. He did it for your sake.
[time=3213] I don't know if you have come to grips with the crucifixion, if you have come to understand what it means that Christ died.
[time=3220] But until you come to understand that his death upon the cross was a one-on-one relationship, until you believe with all of your heart that if you were the only created being outside of Christ, and he came here, he would have come to die for you one-on-one.
[time=3238] Some time ago, a poet tried to put this together and he wrote these words.
[time=3243] He said, "My sins laid open to the rod, the back from which all guilt was free, and the eternal Son of God received the stripes once due to me."
[time=3256] I pierced those sacred hands and feet that never touched or walked in sin.
[time=3262] I broke the heart that only beat the souls of sinful men to win.
[time=3267] The sponge of vinegar and gall by me was placed upon his tongue, and when derision mocked his call, I stood the mocking crowd among.
[time=3277] No beam was in his eye or moat, nor laid to him was any blame, and yet his cheeks for me were smoked.
[time=3286] The cheeks that never blushed for shame, and yet his blood was shed for me to be of sin the double cure and bomb their flows from Calvary's tree that heals my guilt and makes me pure.
[time=3302] Consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he were rich for my sake became poor, that I through his poverty might be made rich, shall we pray.
[time=3317] Father, there is only one thing that we can say in response to your love for us. Thank you.
[time=3323] Thank you, Father, for Jesus Christ, and thank you, wonderful Savior, for your willingness to die in our place.
[time=3338] Father, I do not thank you today as part of a great congregation.
[time=3342] I thank you as one individual among the millions of mankind who has sensed and felt your grace in you.

[time=3484] Father, as we extend the hymn of appeal in a moment, and as we offer the opportunity for men and women to acknowledge Christ as their Savior,
[time=3494] we would ask that Satan would be defeated in his every attempt to disturb the concentration in the hearts of those who are seekers.
[time=3503] We pray that men and women who have heard the claims of Christ proclaimed at another time might today come to grips with their own eternal destiny.
[time=3515] I pray, Father, that you will help us to be sensitive to the Spirit of God in this invitation time.
[time=3522] May we pray for those around us who may not know the, make it to be a time of real commitment in the lives of men and women as they come,
[time=3531] as they come to know you in a personal way.
[time=3534] We commit these moments that are before us to the glory of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, we want His will.
[time=3541] We want to know His purpose in every decision that is made.
[time=3547] And it is in that spirit that we conclude this prayer in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=3556] We're going to sing together today a hymn of invitation. It is hymn number 500.
