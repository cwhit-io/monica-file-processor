[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=15] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=20] To present the Bible Hour with master Nathan Jerima.
[time=32] [MUSIC]
[time=62] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=66] >> That's a great singing.
[time=70] We thank you for joining in the praise of God with us as we begin this part of our service today.
[time=77] It is a sobering thing to look back upon the rich heritage that we have as Christians and as Americans and to assess the situation that is ours today in our country, both politically and religiously.
[time=93] It is very easy for us to judge the cause of our present condition.
[time=101] In the words of an Old Testament writing, we have forgotten God.
[time=106] Today in our scripture lesson we're going to look at what happens to a nation that forgets God.
[time=112] And ultimately to understand that a nation is made up of individuals and what happens to a nation that forgets God is that which happens to individuals who forget God.
[time=122] It may seem to you at this point in time that no one who's ever known the Christian message could forget God, but I am certain that before we're through today, you will understand that the warning of the Old Testament is something which all of us do well to hear and to apply to our own hearts.
[time=141] First of all, we have some music, and we trust that the music will be an encouragement to your heart.
[time=146] We're in the midst of some great days here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and even the music reflects the dynamic of praise we have in our hearts for our God.
[time=155] Listen carefully as our choir sings for us a hymn of great praise, and anthem, if you will, I sing the mighty power of God.
[time=173] I sing the mighty power of God and pay the mountains rise.
[time=184] As thread the flowing seas of broad and built the lofty skies.
[time=193] I sing the wisdom and warning to rule the day.
[time=202] The blue shines low as his coming, and all the stars obey.
[time=215] I sing the goodness of the Lord that fill the earth with wood.
[time=224] Before the creatures with his word, and then call us them good.
[time=233] No one else I walk, there's a disdain where I turn my eye.
[time=241] If I survey the ground, I train the gates upon the sky.
[time=253] There's not a plan for our below that makes our glory soar.
[time=264] And clouds our eyes and hymns roam by order from the throne.
[time=273] While all that sorrows my coming is ever in my care.
[time=282] And everywhere that men and me have all our praise and prayer.
[time=294] All men, all men.
[time=313] What a motivation it is to rise early on Sunday morning and to hear the praises of our God.
[time=320] I'd like to share and continue with you the praise to our great God by reading for you today Psalm 8.
[time=327] O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth,
[time=334] who has set thy glory above the heavens.
[time=338] Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, you have ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
[time=349] When I consider thy heavens, the works of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,
[time=356] which thou ordained, what is man, that thou art mindful of him,
[time=362] and the son of man that thou visitest him.
[time=365] For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and have crowned him with glory and honor.
[time=372] And thou made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.
[time=377] Thou hast put all things under his feet.
[time=380] All sheep and oxen, yea, the beast of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea.
[time=392] O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.
[time=398] The praise to our God in Psalm 8. Thank you.
[time=405] Mr. Hawks is our minister of youth, and he is read for us the eighth Psalm.
[time=409] Now we're going to listen to our ladies' trio as they ask a question that is recorded in the New Testament, a question that the Lord asks his disciples, specifically his wayward disciple Peter.
[time=425] And the question is this, love us thou me more than these.
[time=431] Modern times have brought us many come home.
[time=445] People live in love and love jewelry.
[time=453] But the master still has this question.
[time=461] Love is our me, love is our me more than these.
[time=469] God must not be more than these, my child, but will your hands be?
[time=483] O gracious Lord, I love thee more than all of these.
[time=492] For the faith, more than love, more than the world.
[time=507] I love thee more than this old world that I feel.
[time=514] O supermolys, I deny for thee.
[time=521] I love my life, my life, my flesh be.
[time=529] I love thee Lord, I love thee Lord, more than these.
[time=536] Love is our me more than these, my child, and will your hands be?
[time=551] O precious Lord, I love thee more than all of these.
[time=560] More than faith, more than love, more than the world.
[time=569] More than faith, more than all.
[time=580] Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour Today.
[time=586] And during this time, as we receive the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, we want to take a few moments to talk with those of you who are watching at home.
[time=594] And today especially to those of you outside of the Fort Wayne area who are watching us on stations in Chicago, South Bend and Indianapolis.
[time=603] We thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour Ministry and we counted a real privilege to extend the borders of this ministry to where you are that we might minister to you hearts today.
[time=613] Now we've been talking during these past few weeks about the Founders Club and we're coming down to the conclusion of the Founders Club Enrollment Campaign.
[time=621] So we want to take a few moments today to remind you again of the importance of your joining with us as we try to send the gospel of Jesus Christ out through the means of television.
[time=632] My wife Donna is here and you've been a part of all that we've been saying about the Founders Club.
[time=637] The Founders Club Donna is a group of faithful individuals who stand with us month by month in underwriting the cost of the Bible Hour and stand with us day by day and praying for the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=649] One of the ways that we encourage Founders Club members is by providing them with what we call the Founders Club family provisions and you have a couple of those in your hands. Why don't you share with our friends again what it is that they receive as they get involved with us in the Founders Club family.
[time=667] One item that we would like to put into your homes each month is our Bible study booklet.
[time=672] These are Bible study guides written by my husband each month to encourage you in a systematic plan of Bible study.
[time=680] Donna, that Bible study guide has been used in many, many homes to get people involved in a regular systematic day by day time with God.
[time=689] And that's the purpose of it all to get you into the Word for yourself.
[time=692] I have in my hand another one of the family provisions.
[time=695] It's a little what we call a watch word and it is a scripture text from the Bible which is very beautifully presented on a placard that sits on your desk or is available to place anywhere in your home in a prominent place to remind you of some scriptural principle. This month the principle is this with God all things are possible. A verse of scripture from the book of Matthew chapter 19 and verse 26. Each month a new scripture text placard is sent into your home as a part of the Founders Club family provisions. And then Donna you have in your hand something else that's a part of the Founders Club family. For each individual who joins our Founders Club we would like to send you this certificate which indicates that you are financially supporting us each month and upholding us in prayer. The Founders Club is made up of individuals or families who commit themselves to give a certain amount each month to the Bible hour ministry.
[time=755] We have many families who give ten dollars a month, some who give fifteen, some who give twenty, some who give twenty-five. We have a special Founders Club family provision for all of those families that get involved at a level of fifteen dollars a month or more and it's this clear word edition of the Bible with the Bible hour edition on the front and your name engraved in gold on the front of the Bible. It's a beautiful copy of the scripture with good large print so that every member of the family can read it and it is a beautifully leather bound edition of the Bible which you'll be proud to take with you anywhere you go. Now these Founders Club family provisions are just a way of us saying to you that we appreciate your involvement with us. Now we want to share with you how you can get involved in the Founders Club as we conclude this Founders Club enrollment campaign if you haven't gotten involved yet there's still time and we'd like to hear from you Donna, how is it that a person enrolls in the Founders Club? The most convenient way for you to contact us is through our toll free number. That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=823] You call that number and ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like to join the Founders Club and then specify to her the amount of monthly support which you would like to be committed to.
[time=835] It's very important that you call today although the operators are available anytime during the week they are expecting our calls on this day and so why not go to your phone right now and call 1-800-247-2160.
[time=847] When the operator answers tell her that you are listening to the Bible hour and you want to be a part of the Founders Club tell her how much you would like to give each month and immediately we will get that information and begin to send you the Founders Club family and you'll be involved in helping us and we in turn can have a ministry in a very in-depth way back into your home. We need to hear yet from many more of you. We want to express our appreciation to the many of you who have already called. The response has been encouraging and we thank you for it.
[time=879] We trust that many will still call and be a part of this Enrollment Campaign as we enlarge our support base that we might enlarge the borders of this ministry and reach even more people than we already are touching. Now it won't be long Donna before Christmas is here.
[time=895] I'm not even going to ask you if you've started the Christmas shopping yet but we have a special event that occurs around here during the Christmas season don't we?
[time=903] Yes last year we initiated the Living Christmas Tree and I think that was an experience that none of us will ever forget and we're happy to announce that this year we are going to be presenting it again and you need to get in touch with us right away if it's possible for you to attend. Donna the last few concerts I have written down here so that I can remind our friends and they will appear on the screen as they watch this telecast. There are five concerts this year that are available Friday December the 15th at eight o'clock again Saturday December the 16th at eight o'clock Sunday December the 17th there are two concerts one at five o'clock and one at eight o'clock and then the final concert Tuesday December the 19th at eight o'clock. Now the tickets to the concerts are free but you must have a ticket to get into the concert it is the only way we can control the crowds who come last year over 5,000 people gathered here we've increased the number of concerts by one this year so that we can encourage more to come but you will not be allowed to enter the concert without a ticket. Now the tickets are available free from our office but let me remind you that you may not receive your tickets by calling the 800 number in order to get your tickets for the living Christmas tree concert you must write to us at post office box 15250 here in Fort Wayne and when you write include a self-addressed stamped envelope and we will send your tickets back to you by return mail. Once again let me urge you please do not call the 800 number and request tickets for the living Christmas tree they are not set up to accept that request we must handle those requests through the mail and I hope you will sit down and write to us today if you would like to be a part of the Christmas tree pageant. Now once again before we go back to our morning service let me encourage you if you haven't already done so we'd love to hear from you that you're going to stand with us as a member of the Founders Club family and we ask you to call this number for the Founders Club enrollment 1-800-247-2160 when you call tell the Founders Club Bible operator that you want to enroll at a certain level tell her that you would like to give $10, $15, $20, whatever it is that you've determined to do and she will take that down and we'll get back to you in this week and get you enrolled in the Founders Club and we appreciate so much what you're doing. We're believing God for a great miracle during this time and the enrollment of many new people to help us as we try to spread the gospel in these days ahead. Now we're going back to the service in a few moments we're going to be opening our Bibles together and talking about the wonderful privilege God gives us in remembering what he's done for us in the past. You'll want to have your Old Testaments handy and the book of Deuteronomy is our text. I trust you'll stay with us through the remainder of this hour.
[time=1075] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1079] When we think of the sinfulness of mankind and then as I look out over this full auditorium this morning and think that most of the people here have experienced new life in Jesus Christ we can only sing with the songwriter the song that star in our wild will sing for us right now. It took a miracle of love and grace.
[time=1117] [MUSIC - 356 seconds]
[time=1477] not miss what you would say to us today as we think back and as we look forward in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1485] These words which I have read for you this morning were uttered to the people of Israel at a
[time=1493] very special time in their history. In essence, it was a parting of the ways. They had come to the
[time=1500] end of their wilderness wanderings. They were about to enter into the Promised Land. There was to
[time=1506] be a change in their circumstances. But not only that, they were about to lose their revered leader,
[time=1513] Moses, the one who had guided them through all the difficult experiences that they had had in the
[time=1519] desert and had brought them out of the land of Egypt. He was about to be gathered to his people and would be replaced by another leader. There was to be for Israel a set of new circumstances,
[time=1531] there was to be new leadership. And so Moses gathers them together for his final charges to them and
[time=1537] he relates to them his experiences with them and his expectations for them. Filled in his heart with
[time=1546] anxiety, yes, you can sense that as you read his words, he was afraid for his people. He knew that
[time=1552] they had been able to exist in the wilderness. He was not sure they would be able to exist in a land which was filled with good and plenty. And so he called them to a ministry of remembrance.
[time=1564] Properly stored, memory is an inspiration to the present task and a great force for the future.
[time=1573] Moses understood that and he recognized that the greatest thing he could do for his people at such
[time=1579] a time in their history was to point them back to the to the past to give them a course in history
[time=1585] and remind them of what God had done for them and then to challenge and exhort them to remember.
[time=1590] Now the word remember in the text here is a word which literally means to mark out.
[time=1596] It is a word which could be found in connection with a map or a signpost. We could literally read
[time=1604] verse two and thou shalt mark out all the way which the Lord thy God led thee. Thou shalt chart
[time=1611] it out upon the map. Thou shalt go back and and reenter it into the the book of remembrance. Thou
[time=1617] shall point out every place along the way where God has led thee. God had given to the people of
[time=1623] Israel some marks to put upon the chart upon the map which would cause them to remember his hand
[time=1629] and his leadership over them. It is interesting to me that the Bible makes good use of memory.
[time=1637] God in his institution of the Israeli economy and the Old Testament system gave to the people of Israel three national feasts. They were nothing more nor less than his means by which he would
[time=1647] cause them to remember. These three national feasts were first of all the feasts of unleavened bread
[time=1653] in which the Passover was observed. It was a reminder of their deliverance from Egypt and the
[time=1659] bondage which was theirs. He instituted the feast of first fruits in which the Pentecost was observed.
[time=1666] It recalled God's faithfulness to them in the harvest and in nature which had brought to them a bountiful supply of food. The Sabbath itself was an institution by God to keep the people of Israel
[time=1680] in a spirit of gratitude for their deliverance from Egyptian slavery. The rest of the Sabbath
[time=1686] being a reminder that one day they had been in the bondage of the slavery of Egypt. It is interesting
[time=1693] to me that as you study the history of Israel at every transition, at every new phase of her life, God through his prophets and through his leaders called them to remember what he had done for them
[time=1705] in the past. To a generation about to enter the Promised Land in the 11th chapter of this very book,
[time=1711] you will find a rehearsal of all God's activities in behalf of the people of Israel. In the farewell
[time=1719] song of Moses recorded in the 32nd chapter of the book of Deuteronomy. As Moses was about to pass
[time=1725] on to the other side, the Scripture says in that farewell song are these words. Remember the days
[time=1732] of old. In Joshua's final charge to his people as he was coming to the end of his time of leadership.
[time=1739] He gathered the people together. He called them to remember all of the exploits through which God
[time=1746] had led them in the settling of the Promised Land. And on the basis of the rehearsal of that great historical blessing of God, it was then that Joshua made this challenge to his people. He said,
[time=1757] "Choose you this day whom you will serve. Will you serve the God who has led us in the past, or will you serve the gods that you will meet in the future as you delve out into the lands of other peoples and nations?" When King Saul was anointed as the king of Israel, Samuel the prophet
[time=1774] rehearsed all of God's deliverances of Israel before his time. That's found in 1 Samuel chapter 12.
[time=1782] When Nehemiah had finished the walls of Jerusalem and had reconstructed them,
[time=1788] Ezra, the spiritual leader, came in and restored the reading of the law.
[time=1792] And then he turned it over to the priests, the religious leaders of the day, and Nehemiah records
[time=1799] in the ninth chapter the recital of all of God's blessings upon the nation of Israel.
[time=1805] It is a historical narrative of all of the turning points in the life of the people of Israel.
[time=1811] Many of the Psalms which were written by David take advantage of memory and remembrance as a means
[time=1818] of praise. A few moments ago, Mr. Hawks read for us from the eighth Psalm, and he read something
[time=1825] like this, "When I consider the heavens and the work of thy fingers, the moon, the stars,
[time=1831] which thou hast ordained. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth. When I
[time=1838] remember thy creative acts, I am caused to praise thee. Psalm 30 has the same sentiment in it. It says
[time=1845] in Psalm 30 verse 4, "Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance
[time=1852] of his holiness. When we remember who God is, it causes us to praise." Psalm 105 verse 15 says this,
[time=1861] "O give thanks unto the Lord. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done, his wonders,
[time=1869] and the judgments of his mouth. O listen, memory is a mighty tool in the hand of God."
[time=1875] There is an interesting expression that we use sometimes around the season of the year. It is a
[time=1882] word we call the word Thanksgiving. And if you delve back into the beginning of that word,
[time=1888] you will discover that thank is related to think, that those two words originally came from the same
[time=1895] home, that they had a common beginning, almost as if to remind us that to be thankful is first of
[time=1901] all to be thankful, to remember is to rejoice. And one of the things that God has given to us in his
[time=1908] word is a solid evidence that remembering is a key to our proper attitude toward the present.
[time=1915] We do not have to appeal only to the Old Testament for such a pattern. In the New Testament,
[time=1921] we have the Lord's Supper instituted, and we're told in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 15,
[time=1927] "This do as often as ye eat in remembrance of me. God has given to us a visual aid to cause us to
[time=1935] remember his death upon the cross." I was interested in reading this week the story of the writing
[time=1942] of the great hymn Amazing Grace, John Newton, remembering his years as an infidel, a one-time slave
[time=1951] trader. Yes, even the servant of a slave trader, a man who had gone down to the very depths of
[time=1957] despair, John Newton was restored from that condition and given the commission to be a preacher,
[time=1964] a pastor, a counselor, a hymn writer, an author. And John Newton wrote the words, "Amazing Grace,
[time=1972] how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me." John Newton understood the power of memory to cause
[time=1980] him to rejoice at what was his in light of what had been his in the past. So we come to these
[time=1987] closing charges by Moses to his people, and it is not surprising to me that in light of the context of the Word of God, Moses uses an injunction to memory to properly prepare his people for the next
[time=1999] phase in their corporate life. Now I'd like for you to notice with me back in the eighth chapter of Deuteronomy what it is he wanted them to remember. I hope you will engage me in a moment of
[time=2011] frivolity in the lack of dignity as I was thinking about Thanksgiving this week and the power of it
[time=2019] and the therapy of it and the importance of it as we look at the past and prepare for the future.
[time=2024] I came across this mundane reminder of its importance. It goes like this. There was a dash
[time=2032] hound once so long. He hadn't any notion how long it took to notify his tale of his emotion.
[time=2039] And so it happened while his eyes were filled with woe and sadness, his little tail went wagging on
[time=2047] because of previous gladness. Now there is a message in that and that is that when we come to a spirit
[time=2055] of thanksgiving about the past it can prepare us to have the proper attitude toward the present.
[time=2061] That's what Moses is going to do as he challenges his people. Will you notice first of all that he challenges them to remember the past relationships that they had as far as God was concerned. Notice
[time=2073] in the eighth chapter and the 14th verse that the first thing he wanted them to remember or one of the priority matters of remembrance was their deliverance from Egypt. We read in the 14th verse,
[time=2087] "Then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God who brought the forth out of the land
[time=2095] of Egypt. The Old Testament literature, the writings of the prophets, the historical narratives,
[time=2104] you will discover as you study it and read it that it continually forces the people of Israel back to their Egyptian bondage to remind them of that from which they had been redeemed over and over
[time=2116] in the Psalms, over and over in the historical portions of the word. You see the writers, the prophets causing the people of Israel to remember what was their plot, what was their plight in the
[time=2128] place of Egypt. In our looking back as Christians we have our Egypt as well. Students of the Bible
[time=2135] understand that in the Old Testament pictures, which portray New Testament truths, Egypt represents
[time=2142] the sinful state of a Christian before he becomes a believer. We too have been brought out of bondage.
[time=2150] There once was a time when we were enslaved in the bondage of sin, but God through his son Jesus
[time=2156] Christ delivered us out of that bondage. And one of the first things I would call you to remember today as we use this passage for present teaching is that you and I have been redeemed out of the
[time=2168] bondage of slavery in just the same way that the people of Israel came out from under the slave
[time=2174] of bondage, of Egyptian leadership, we have been brought out from the bondage of sin. Isn't it
[time=2181] easy for us to forget the first things? We've been Christians, many of us for many years, some of us for a long time, and it's hard for us to remember what it was like to be in the bondage of sin. Oh, how we need to go back to the very beginning. I'm certain that's the reason the
[time=2197] prophets continually forced the people of Israel back to their bondage. They couldn't appreciate what was theirs until they first of all realized what had been theirs when they were in the land of Egypt. Many women, I want to say to you that no matter what's ahead for you as an individual or for us as a church, you can't be the kind of Christian God wants you to be until you can learn
[time=2217] how to remember what it's like to be lost and that from which God has brought you to set you
[time=2223] upon the rock Christ Jesus. I would call you today to a remembrance of your deliverance.
[time=2229] Certainly, that's what the hymn writer meant when he wrote, "Lest I forget Dine agony, lest I forget Gethsemane, lest I forget thy love for me, lead me to Calvary." Over and over again,
[time=2241] we need to be brought back to the place of our deliverance that we will have proper perspective on our present situation. The Old Testament continues to take people back to Egypt, and if you study the New Testament, you will discover that in the writings of the epistles, we are constantly brought back to the cross, constantly driven back to understand what is ours
[time=2262] because of our redemption. But I want you to notice that he not only reminded the people of Israel
[time=2268] of God's deliverance, of them from Egyptian bondage, but he reminded them of God's direction
[time=2275] of them in the wilderness. I want you to notice two verses in the eighth chapter, first of all, the first part of verse two, "And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
[time=2287] these forty years in the wilderness." And then notice verse 15, "Who led thee through that great
[time=2294] and terrible wilderness were in were fiery serpents," etc. In other words, God said through Moses to his
[time=2302] people, "Not only do you need to be aware of your redemption from bondage, and in our terminology,
[time=2308] our salvation out of sin, but you need to remember that having been redeemed out of Egypt,
[time=2315] God led you in every step along the way through the wilderness journey." And wasn't it true?
[time=2321] There is a passage in Deuteronomy that says that God went before them in the way, seeking out a
[time=2328] place to pitch their tents, is if God went before them in the road, determining where they would camp.
[time=2334] If you read the Old Testament story of God's provision for the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings, it reads like a present-day novel. It's an exciting story of the provision of an
[time=2344] almighty God for the people he loves. He accompanied them on the march. There was no hour of difficulty
[time=2351] that the people of Israel felt in the wilderness that God was not present with them. There was no time or testing that they felt but what the presence of God was available to them. He led them by a
[time=2363] pillar at night and by a cloud during the day. The signs and symbols of his abiding presence were
[time=2370] always around them. God led them through the wilderness. He directed their lives. He guided
[time=2376] them. I don't think it's hard for us to make the application to us. Look back as your Christian
[time=2382] life unfolds behind you. Pick any one day that you would pick. Maybe it's a bright day or a dark
[time=2389] day, a glad day or a sad day. Look back through your life as a Christian and remember that in your
[time=2395] life as a Christian, at least three things are true of you if you're born again. First of all, every day you walked as a Christian. You walked in works which were before ordained for you.
[time=2406] God had prepared them. Secondly, remember that every day as a Christian that you have lived, you have always found grace to help in the time of need. For if that's not true, the Bible is not
[time=2417] true. And then thirdly, remember that as a Christian as you look back over your life in the way that God has led you, every day you have found that your needs have been supplied. For the Bible says,
[time=2429] "My God has promised to supply all of our needs according to his riches in Christ Jesus."
[time=2436] Let me remind you for just a moment of how God provided for the needs of the Israelites in their journey. Notice, first of all, verse four. He said, "Thy raiment grew not old upon thee,
[time=2449] neither did thy footswell these forty years." First of all, God gave them clothes that didn't wear out.
[time=2454] Their shoes didn't wear out. Their clothes didn't wear out. They didn't have any place to go and buy
[time=2460] new clothing, new shoes, and so God just miraculously provided that their clothing would be durable.
[time=2466] Long before nylon and orlon, God worked out a plan to make sure their clothing would last.
[time=2472] Then notice also in verse 16, "Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna."
[time=2479] God provided for them bread to eat. And verse 15, "Who led thee through the great terrible
[time=2485] wilderness where there was no water, who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint." Now it's interesting to me that what Moses reminds the Israelites concerning in this particular situation is not all of the extra things God gave them, but that he provided the necessities of life, the absolute needs that they had. It reminds us of a text we studied just a
[time=2506] few days ago where we were talking about contentment. And it says in that New Testament passage,
[time=2512] "Having food and raiment, they're with to be content." And that's what God provided for his
[time=2518] people. And men and women can we not look back as Christians and discover anew that since the moment we were brought out of the bondage of sin, God has provided for us the necessities of life.
[time=2529] He has given to us the basic things that we've needed to survive in our Christian experience and in our physical lives. For the Bible says that he will not ever let one of his children be in need or in want. They had never a day without the provision of necessities.
[time=2547] The wilderness all about them, the lack of living things very evident to them and yet God miraculously
[time=2554] provided for them every single day. How wonderful it is to see how God has led each of us individually
[time=2563] and all of us corporately as a church. Now in verse 15 it says that he led them
[time=2571] through the wilderness, through that great and terrible wilderness. And then at the end of
[time=2578] verse 16 it says he did that in order that he might do good to them at the latter end.
[time=2583] Now I suppose if we could rewrite that story in our situation, we would say, "Lord, I'm glad for
[time=2590] you to lead me, but please don't lead me through the wilderness. I'd just as soon be away from the
[time=2596] problems of the wilderness." If you will see the description you'll notice that it's not very exciting, it calls the wilderness a terrible wilderness filled with serpents and scorpions and drought
[time=2607] where there was no water. But the scripture said God led his people through the wilderness to do
[time=2614] them good at the latter end. I really couldn't comprehend that in this text until I went back
[time=2620] to the beginning of the chapter and noticed that Moses had given the threefold purpose for such a journey. He had given to them three reasons why God would take them on such a route. Would it not
[time=2631] have been possible for God to have led them around the wilderness? Into the promised land through some other route? Oh yes, but God had a purpose in leading them through that experience and notice what it says about that purpose as we come back to the beginning of the chapter and read in verse 2, "Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these 40 years
[time=2653] in the wilderness first of all to humble thee." You know God leads us through the experiences
[time=2659] of our wilderness in this life, first of all, that he might humble us. I don't know about you,
[time=2665] but I find myself to be at war with that idea. I'm not excited about being humbled. I don't think
[time=2671] anybody I've talked to realistically says, "I'm praying that God will lead me through the scorpions and the serpents and the terrible wilderness that I might be humbled." That's not an exciting principle,
[time=2682] but let me say to you that the outcome of that is the most wonderful thing God can ever do for one of his children. For you see that whole concept of humility is at the opposite end of the most
[time=2693] awful and heinous sin that is known to man today, the sin of pride. And when God begins to work on
[time=2699] his people and take them through the bitter experiences of life, knocking off the rough edges
[time=2705] and smoothing us down, doing away with our own self-sufficiency, and he teaches us the beauty of
[time=2711] humility, he makes us to be a creature likened to himself. Oh, what a wonderful thing it is when
[time=2717] God determines to let us go through the wilderness experiences, taking us by the hand that he might make us to be one of his. God teaches humility by putting us in the extremities of life,
[time=2732] where there is no one to turn to, where our resources and self-sufficiency is gone.
[time=2737] God leads us through the wilderness to humble us. You notice secondly that he said, "I did all of
[time=2744] this not only that I might humble thee, but that I might prove thee." Verse two says, "And to test
[time=2750] thee to know what was in thine heart, whether thou would us keep his commandments or not." Now, let me point out to you that God wasn't trying to find out for himself what the people of Israel would do, for he knew what was in man. But he was trying to find out for them so that they in turn
[time=2766] could understand what they would do in such a situation. When he puts us in the midst of a wilderness testing, it is not for him to determine in his own mind what we're going to do in the situation. He puts us in that situation so that we will learn about ourselves and we will determine
[time=2783] what we really are. Do you know that anyone who goes through a difficult time, and some of you have gone through some recently, any one of you who goes through the circumstances that could be described as a spiritual wilderness will discover things about yourself you didn't know before.
[time=2797] Some of you will identify a spirit of rebellion that you never realized existed in your life.
[time=2803] Some of you will discover that you are almost on the verge of blaspheming in the midst of the
[time=2809] wilderness. You can imagine that you would ever be capable of such a thing. Some of you will learn that you're a coward. When you thought yourself to be strong and brave in the midst of the wilderness, you will discover that you have cowardice in your life. Some will find out that you're dishonest and greedy. The Bible says that when we go through these testing, God reveals to us what we need to know about ourselves and what is the purpose of that so that we might be filled with despair and discouragement? Oh no. He does it so that as we know ourselves, we reach out to the providing God
[time=2840] and we feel our own insufficiencies with the sufficient God who will provide. It is so often
[time=2847] true of all of us that when we walk in the good experiences of life, we do not understand our need for God. So he puts us in the vice and men and women, you can kick and scream all you want, but he won't let you out of that vice until he's done with you until he's proven to you that you are not sufficient of yourself to do anything of yourself. He does it to prove you. But I like the
[time=2869] last one. And this one is in verse 3. He says, "And he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and
[time=2875] fed thee with manna which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee to
[time=2881] know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[time=2887] God." Now you know these words as the words which were spoken by Jesus Christ in the wilderness
[time=2893] in response to the temptation of Satan. But I want you to understand that these words are
[time=2899] normally misunderstood and misinterpreted. Most of the time when you read that in the book of Matthew
[time=2905] you hear people say, "Now folks, what that means is that you're not supposed to be concerned about material things, but you're supposed to live upon the Word of God which is the bread of life." And they refer that text to the Scripture. And there is a reference to it to be sure, but that is not by any means the primary meaning or interpretation of that Old Testament situation.
[time=2924] What did he mean when he said that he put him in the wilderness so that they would learn that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God?
[time=2934] Well, let me give you an illustration in the wilderness as they gathered and it was time for
[time=2940] supper. Suddenly it dawned upon the Israelites that they had no bread. And they said, "How do we get
[time=2948] bread?" Well, I remember back in Egypt we used to take our seed corn out there and plant it by the Nile it would grow up and we'd get it and we'd make our own bread, but there's no Nile. There's no seed corn. How are they going to get bread? God had to miraculously provide it for them. You say,
[time=2966] "Oh, he did that so that they would know he could miraculously provide for them." No, he did it so that they would understand that even back in Egypt in the Nile where the seed corn was planted and it grew, it was God who had provided it for them back then as well. And he had to get the intermediate agencies out of the way so he could put himself directly in front of them and teach
[time=2987] them the lesson that all of us need to learn so desperately that whether it's by the might of our own hand, it is God that gives us the power to do it, whatever intermediate agencies are there,
[time=2998] it is God that is ultimately behind the provision of our life. What does it mean when it says that
[time=3004] men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God, men and women, it means that behind every good thing we have in our lives, behind every provision
[time=3015] that we provide in the intermediate relationships of life, there is God. Go back beyond the loaf of
[time=3022] bread, go back beyond the bakery, go back beyond the planting, go back beyond the production of the
[time=3029] seed, go back beyond it all as far back as you can go and you will find that behind it all is an Almighty God who by the word of his mouth has provided the needs of your life. And one of the
[time=3040] things I fear is we look around at the ministries that God gives us as a church and the provisions that we have in life and the programs that God brings to us and the opportunities to give and
[time=3051] to build and all the rest of us that we forget that man does not live by bread alone but man lives
[time=3057] by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God, back beyond the together we build program,
[time=3063] back beyond the giving of sacrificial gifts, back beyond all of it is an Almighty God who
[time=3069] wants to provide for us and as he took one day his prophet Elijah down to the brook and let the brook run dry to teach that prophet that he was not only the provider of every good thing but he
[time=3081] was the source in Elijah's life so sometimes he has to take us and strip away all of the intermediate
[time=3088] things so we stand naked before him and recognize every gift comes from God and he is the one who
[time=3095] provides by the word of his mouth everything we need there was no brook there was no well
[time=3103] there was no water but God caused it to come out of the flinty rock there was no bread but it came
[time=3111] from heaven there was no clothing but God miraculously let it happen that their clothing would wear for
[time=3118] 40 years now why did Moses teach them this lesson in history let me just close by reminding you
[time=3127] that he did it with a view to the future he did it with a view to the future could I say it this way
[time=3135] people God took them back through the difficulties of the past through the leadership of Moses because
[time=3141] he knows man listen now man exists in a better relationship to God in the wilderness than he does
[time=3150] in the promised land is that not true in the wilderness every day I have to look up to heaven to see the man come down in the wilderness I have to walk out to that unbelievable well carved out of a rock and understand that's a miracle God provided for me every day I look at my clothing
[time=3166] and see that it hasn't worn out yet my shoes are still good and I have to look up to heaven and say thank you God for what you've done but oh let man get into a place of prosperity let him get into a place where he's begun to carve out things for himself you can understand
[time=3182] the warnings of Moses listen to them in verses 7 and 8 for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a
[time=3188] good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills a
[time=3195] land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomgranates a land of olive oil and honey a land
[time=3201] where end thou shall eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig bronze now listen when thou hast eaten and
[time=3212] art full then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee in other
[time=3218] words God was saying Israel remember in the good land every word from the mouth of God is your provision
[time=3224] just like it was in the wilderness and then he warns them beware beware that thou forget not the
[time=3231] Lord thy God in not keeping his commandments lest when thou hast eaten and art full and has built
[time=3237] goodly houses and dwell therein when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold
[time=3243] are multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the
[time=3251] Lord thy God who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt and thou savor seventeen in thine heart
[time=3259] my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this well but thou shalt remember the Lord
[time=3268] thy God the closing of the chapter there is a reminder to us that if we fail to remember the Lord our God he will cause us to be as other nations who perished before us in the past in one
[time=3282] very quick easy to read passage of scripture men and women
[time=3288] is a description of why we are where we are as a country we were founded on the principles of
[time=3296] God dependent upon him and we have become rich and wealthy and we have said I have gotten this wealth for myself and we have forgotten God it is an absurd thing to say America is a Christian
[time=3307] nation any longer and that discourages all of us but let me say something to you you who are
[time=3313] Christians there are many Christians who have forgotten that man doth not live by bread alone
[time=3320] but by every word that preceded out of the mouth of God some of us who are self-made and independent
[time=3326] believe that through our power we have gotten what we have it is my energy and my strength and my
[time=3332] determination that's gotten me what we have every word that preceded out of the mouth of God
[time=3340] so God would take us back to our history today he would take us back to our conversion and our
[time=3347] redemption from sin and he would remind us that he has led us as Christians and he has taken
[time=3353] some of us through difficult situations that he might teach us that we are dependent upon an Almighty God for every single aspect of our lives and may we never forget it we are upon the verge
[time=3365] of some of the great days in our church I'm excited about the future but I don't want to ever forget what it was like to start out in a little mobile home with not very much that we could call
[time=3376] our own and never do I want us to get into a place where God has provided for us all the good things
[time=3382] we need to reach out to our community and then for us to say as a church look what we've done for man does not live by bread alone but by every word that preceded out of the mouth of God shall
