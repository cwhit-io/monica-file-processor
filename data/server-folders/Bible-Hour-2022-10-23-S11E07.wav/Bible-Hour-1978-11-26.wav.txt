[time=14] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=20] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeramond.
[time=25] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=61] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=64] We are so glad to have all of you present with us here in the auditorium
[time=71] and those of our friends who have joined us by television.
[time=74] This is an exciting service of victory, and if we could use the word celebration, we would use it for a great victory that God has wrought in our midst.
[time=86] As most of you know, we are looking toward the beginning of a new building program and the acquisition of some new properties for the expansion of our ministries.
[time=94] During these last months, we have been involved in a program of stewardship here within our own congregation, among our own people, with some very exciting goals that were set ahead of us.
[time=107] And we're going to be sharing during the service today what God has wrought among us
[time=113] in the victory that has been won for His namesake and for His glory.
[time=118] And I trust that you will rejoice with us throughout the service as we sing praises to God, as we honor Him and we glorify His name.
[time=127] We know that God is a jealous God and will share His glory with no one and so with gladness of heart.
[time=133] We lift our hearts and our lips in praise to Him for what He has done for us, and we know to Him the glory belongs, and we're grateful and thankful for what He has done.
[time=145] Now our choir is going to sing for us.
[time=147] They're under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=164] When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, the time shall be no more, and the morning breaks eternal, bright and fair.
[time=172] When the state of earth shall gather over on the other shore, and the role is called a gander, I'll be there.
[time=180] Don't you know, don't you know, it's all a gander?
[time=185] Don't you know, it's all a gander?
[time=194] When the role is called a gander, I'll be there.
[time=197] Don't you know, it's all a gander?
[time=330] In loving kindness, Jesus came,
[time=338] My soul in the sea to reclaim,
[time=344] And from the depths of sin and shame, Through grace he lifted me.
[time=356] He called me long before I heard,
[time=362] Before my central heart was stirred.
[time=366] But when I took him at his word,
[time=372] For given he lifted me.
[time=376] Now on a higher plane I dwell,
[time=382] And with my soul I know it is well, Yet how or why I cannot tell,
[time=392] He should have lifted me.
[time=398] From sinking sand,
[time=404] He lifted me with tender hand.
[time=410] He lifted me.
[time=416] From shades of night To plains of light, Or praises name.
[time=428] He lifted me with tender hand.
[time=438] Just when I need him, Jesus is near, Just when I falter, Just when I feel, Ready to help me, Ready to cheer, Just when I need him lost,
[time=464] Just when I need him most,
[time=470] Just when I need him most, My Jesus is near, To come forward and cheer,
[time=482] Just when I need him most,
[time=488] I must tell Jesus, All of my trials, I cannot bear my burdensome.
[time=500] In my distress he kindly will help.
[time=506] He ever loves and cares for his own.
[time=512] I must tell Jesus, I must tell my Jesus,
[time=522] I cannot bear these burdensome.
[time=528] I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus, Jesus can help me, Jesus can help me, I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus, Jesus can help me, Jesus, Oh, Oh, Oh, Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today, and for allowing us the privilege of entering your home with the message of God's Word and gospel music that we know has already been a blessing to you. Each time Paul Schumacher comes to minister with us we rejoice in the gift that God has given him to communicate through music.
[time=590] Now we want to take the opportunity that God gives us while we're receiving the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to speak to you more directly about your part in the Bible Hour ministry. Joining me during this time is my wife Donna. Donna we've been talking these days about the importance of the Founders Club. Why don't you share with us again how important and vital that is to the ministry of the Bible Hour as we proclaim God's truth each week. Well the Founders Club is vitally important because without it we probably would not be able to be on the earth here. The Founders Club is made up of a group of people who regularly have committed themselves to support the Bible Hour and they just agree that they will send us $10, $15, $20 each month to help us stay on the air. Donna that may seem so insignificant to people who are watching at home and yet you know it's the only way that a television ministry can be stabilized so that there is stability to it. If we depended for instance on random giving just as people felt led to give we would have such an up and down scale of giving that there would be no way we could sustain a regular ministry. Over the years God has brought together a group of over 700 families now who support this ministry with their giving and during this time of Founders Club enrollment we have seen a great number of new people join with us in this support ministry.
[time=674] How thankful we are for everyone who is written or called to become involved in the Founders Club ministry and we want to express our appreciation to every one of you has responded in that way and to encourage a great number of you to continue to pray that God will lay it upon your heart to be a part of this great family of people who keep the Bible Hour on the air.
[time=694] Now when you give and you support this ministry you become a part of a cycle of information that comes into your home from our office each month.
[time=702] I want to share with them first of all Donna the book of the month which is a very special Bible study guide that we prepare here in our office.
[time=710] It is a question and answer manual that takes you into the scriptures for yourself enables you to study the Word of God and get to the meat of the Word so that you can understand what the Bible says. It is not our telling you what it says but it is our helping you to find for yourself what God's Word is saying to you each day. Every month two copies of this book of the month study is sent into your home as a way of extending Bible study into your life. Donna that is only one of many Founders Club provisions. You have a couple of others that we enjoy sharing with our Founders Club family. For each person who joins our Founders Club we would like to send you a certificate of membership and this is just our way of saying thank you to you for supporting us regularly each month and it is a beautiful little certificate that would look nice on any wall and then another item which we would like to send to you is our watch word. This particular one is rejoice evermore and these are nice to stick over the sinker on your desk just somewhere that will be an encouragement to you during the day as you work. These are just individual ways that we have thought of and prayed about that will help us to say to you listen we appreciate you and we thank you for what you're doing to help us. We want to remind you that your commitment is not necessarily a lifetime commitment it doesn't mean that you're going to be a part of this forever but it does mean that you have determined during this next year to be a part of the Founders Club ministry. We have discovered that those who began to share with us in this way find such great satisfaction in being a part of the support ministry that they just want to continue but we want you to understand that as God lays this upon your heart you can make this one-year commitment and it will be an exciting thing for you to know that you're investing in the lives of men and women. This past week we got a letter from a family up in Chicago Donna in which there was a check for over $1,000 and a Founders Club enrollment card and a word of appreciation for the Bible hour ministry and in essence what they said was we didn't know there was something we could do to help and we're so grateful to be a part of what the Bible hour is doing. I just have to believe there are many folks like that who know now because of our talk together that the Founders Club is their opportunity to help us spread the gospel and that we just count on them so much during these days to be a part of the encouraging of believers and the evangelizing of the unsaved through the Bible hour. Now in order to join the Bible hour Founders Club there's a special number that they need to be aware of.
[time=866] We have set up a toll-free number which you may call at any time that number is 1-800-247-2160 you ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like to join the Founders Club and that you would like to support the Founders Club each month for 15-20 dollars a month whatever God lays upon your heart. That numbered call again is 1-800-247-2160
[time=892] and Donna let me remind our friends that the toll-free number is exactly that.
[time=898] It's free from any place in the United States. All you do is make sure to dial 1-800-247-2160 ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her you would like to join the Founders Club. She'll understand what you mean and then when you give her the amount of your support she will pass that on to us and we will begin immediately to send the materials into your home that are part of the opportunity to extend the gospel and the Word of God into your home. Once again the number is 2-4-7-2160. Why not call us today?
[time=960] [MUSIC]
[time=990] And that was Mr. Krueger at the Oregon. We thank you for your ministry to us.
[time=998] These have been exciting days and I am so happy to tell you that though we started out with a victory goal of 450,000 dollars to be given by our own people toward this new building and its properties and then we added to that the challenge goal of 650 which was what we hoped might happen and then we put the hallelujah goal on top of that which was 900,000 and that was the dream that on this victory Sunday and there are still I understand somewhere between 80 and 100 cards which have not yet been returned but on this victory Sunday we now have from our own people received gifts and commitments of 1 million and 10 dollars.
[time=1042] Isn't that interesting? 1 million and 10 dollars.
[time=1046] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1050] And what that means is that over these next three years in addition to their regular ties and offerings to this church and also to that which many of them give toward the outreach of television the people of this congregation have made a commitment to give 1 million dollars toward the construction of new facilities for this growing congregation. How grateful we are for each one of you who's part in this magnificent effort for the glory of God and there have been those who have had a special part whom we want to recognize again today the steering committee is a group of folks who had various functions in this program we recognize them at the banquet but I want them all to stand together if they will they're seated down here in the front the steering committee husbands and wives if you would stand now please these are the folks who took the leadership in this program and the chairman of the steering committee and now they remain standing. Mr. or Dr. Richard Mann is going to come and say a few words to them and then lead us in a prayer of thanksgiving for their efforts in this which God has done among us Dr.
[time=1114] Richard Mann.
[time=1118] I'm trembling it was exciting news and as I thought about this time that I would have to share here the time I've had with the steering committee and how to say thank you again my own words were lacking and so as I'm learning and growing in my own spiritual life I chose to turn to God's word to make up for those deficiencies in my own I wanted to read this to the steering committee and to those in our congregation from first chronicles then the heads of the fathers and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly and gave for the service of the house of God then the people rejoiced for they offered willingly because with the perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and David the king also rejoiced with great joy wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel our Father forever and ever Thine O Lord is the greatness in the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come from thee and thou rainest overall and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength and to all now therefore our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but who am I and what are my peoples that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers and our days on the earth are as thy shadow and as there is none abiding O Lord our God all this abundance that we have prepared to build in house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all of thine own. I know also my God that thou testeth the heart and hath pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things and now I have seen with joy thy people who are present here offer willingly unto thee. O Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee and David said to all the congregation now bless the Lord your God and all the congregation bless the Lord God of their fathers and bow down their heads and worship the Lord and the King will you bow please our father this is a great time in our lives and we are reminded of them great times that you have so seen fit to be recorded for our encouragement and our challenge we remember also as recorded in your word of the New Testament our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ many in this committee have worked for three months worked hard the congregation will be working hard in their commitments for the next three years and our Lord and Savior gave that same example in the best remembered three years of his life father but we would also remember in our thanksgiving that even with his victory that we reminded in our victory his victory over the cross and over death that he when then preceded about the encouragement of his disciples and of his believers and also father he preceded even to win others even by example his own half brother James Lord may we remember this special example to encourage one another and to be about thy work at this time of victory in Christ's name our love and savior I pray amen thank you Dick we're going to ask Paul Schumacher to come back and share with us again in music we're so grateful for all that everyone has done to make this victory day a possibility and we thank you in Jesus name and a special word of appreciation to Dr. Mann and his committee now let's rejoice together in music
[time=1440] I had won all I could win
[time=1456] there was no place I hadn't been
[time=1462] still my life was just so
[time=1468] me
[time=1474] and so then I heard Jesus Oh find my way so I gave it up and found it all in me
[time=1500] and I lost it all
[time=1508] to find everything
[time=1514] I died a proper to be poor me when I learned how to lose
[time=1532] then I found out how to win
[time=1538] well I lost it all but I found everything I was planted just to survive
[time=1562] and I was racing to arrive so I walked on any standing in my way
[time=1580] and then I watched my schemes all in time and I realized that I could find new life for that old life had passed away I lost it all
[time=1610] to find everything
[time=1616] I died a proper to be poor a king when I learned how to lose
[time=1634] then I found out how to win
[time=1640] well I lost it all but I found everything
[time=1650] yes I gave it up and I found it all in me
[time=1666] well it sounded like a orchestra got a little tired there
[time=1672] we want to conclude the ministry that it is our privilege to share with you this morning with a medley of worship and praise unto our blessed God.
[time=1702] I walk at night beneath majestic skies
[time=1710] I know behind them isn't God or wise
[time=1718] who pinned all stars
[time=1724] each in a lonely place then wrapped in the dark and robe of space
[time=1738] oh Lord my God a wonder for the world
[time=1748] to make our world
[time=1764] a wonderful glorious
[time=1782] sunset draws me close to heaven
[time=1788] I think of him whose life for me was
[time=1794] King great longing
[time=1800] comes to me when twilight falls
[time=1808] for heaven's home from there my savior calls oh Lord my God a wonder for the world
[time=1830] to make our world to make our world
[time=1840] before my God a wonder for
[time=1852] a glorious oh Lord my God then sings my soul
[time=1868] my savior God to thee
[time=1874] oh how great thou art
[time=1880] how great thou art then sings my soul
[time=1890] my savior God to thee
[time=1896] oh how great thou art
[time=1906] how great
[time=1914] thou art
[time=1926] Paul you couldn't have shared the feeling of our heart any more than you did in that medley we have a wonderful God and we serve him with gladness and it is at a time like this when we recognize how great he is will you take your Bibles and turn with me to the Old Testament and I want you to turn to the book of Nehemiah Nehemiah the eighth chapter
[time=1962] while you're finding your place there let me share with you just a bit of the awe in which I stand at this moment Del Rogers who is the man from Dallas Texas who was helping us during the Together We Build program shared with me the other day after this total was approximated that though he has worked with many hundreds of churches and their organization has worked with many hundreds of churches that never in the history of the Together We Build program has there ever been an accomplishment like what you people have done oh yes there have been many churches that have raised over a million dollars for building programs they have been churches two to three times as large as ours most of them four or five times as old as ours he said when one stops to consider that the church is not even ten years old yet
[time=2025] and that most and many of the people who are a part of the congregation are young in the Lord and that we do not number enough families or individuals to have accomplished what has been done he said only then can this which God has done among us be completely and truly understood I know that the word miracle is tossed about with great abandon these days and I always hesitate ever to attach that word to anything which God does through his own people but I must honestly say that if there ever has been a miracle apart from the miracle of new birth which has transformed many of our lives in this congregation what God has wrought through the together we build program probably comes as close as anything I've ever seen to recognize that through the commitment of the people of this congregation that amount of money has been committed some already given is to recognize a very miraculous thing among us and I have been searching my own heart and the scriptures to know what it is that God would have me to say upon such an occasion Paul probably has said about as much as we could say in giving praise to the Lord we say simply how great thou art then I found myself leafing back through the Old Testament where projects like this seem to be in abundance coming again to the great accomplishment of Nehemiah in the reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem in 52 days and I came to the book with this question when that miracle of the building again of the walls of the city had been accomplished what did Nehemiah do next maybe if I could see what he did next I would know what to do next to and so as I read the scripture I came to the conclusion of the project in chapters 5 and 6 and the registry of all of the people and then at the end of the seventh chapter a list of the gifts that had been given and finally to the eighth chapter which is the next chapter after the conclusion of the building project and the great victory and I read some astounding words I read that all the people gathered themselves together in the broad place which was the gate of the water and they spoke unto Ezra the priest the scribe and they said to him bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord have commanded to Israel now in the book we have read up through the first seven chapters concerning the reconstruction of the walls and now beginning at the eighth chapter there is a break in the flow of teaching to the reconstruction of the people and I think that's ever so good for us to remember at such a time as this there are churches and there are organizations that get infected with edificeitis do you know what that is that is the idea that the ministry of the church is to build buildings and to buy properties and to grow large organizations I want to say to you that God in His Word has given to us the priority of the ministry here God help us if we ever get infected with edificeitis the Lord knows that if we do we will have cut the heart out of the ministry to stop doing what God called us to do what a joy it is to read that finally now that the walls are built and the people are back dwelling in their cities Ezra the priest and Nehemiah the leader come together and in essence they say now folks it's time to get back to the priorities and to underscore again what this whole thing is about what it is that we're trying to do and there is an interesting presentation here of the priority of the ministry of God's people and I would say to all of you as we rejoice on this victory Sunday at the accumulation of a million dollars for buildings and for ministries that what God would have us do in this service is to go back and understand that these are not the end in themselves but simply the means to an end that these buildings will not ever cause anyone to become Christian or to grow spiritually or to become more spiritual but they will be tools in the hands of God so that we can accomplish within their walls the priorities of the ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ and I personally believe without any fear of contradiction that the priority of the ministry is the declaration unashamedly of God's word so I am excited beyond measure when I look at this 8th chapter and I discover that this whole chapter is centered around the word of God now let's take it apart for just a moment and look at it will you notice in the third and the first three verses that we have here in this 8th chapter the preparation for the word of God all how important it is that our hearts be prepared for God's word now the scripture says that they had the proper assembly in their preparation they were gathered together as a unit as a congregation in one place in a broad place now there have been many studies about the gates around the walls of Jerusalem one of which is called the water gate and those who look at the gates of Jerusalem as a type of some purpose in the plan of God understand that the water gate is a picture of the word of God and so it is quite proper that the people would gather in the presence of the water gate for often in the word of God water is a symbol of God's word the Bible tells us that they are in a great assemblage notice in verse one it says all the people gathered themselves together I don't think there's anything in this world that closely approximates the joy we will enjoy in heaven like the gathering together of all of God's people there is something wonderfully spontaneous and exciting about God's family getting together I read all about the people that are decentralizing the church and sending this portion out here and this portion out there and somebody else out to the other far flung corners of the city and all what they miss by not getting together as a group of God's family I don't ever want that to happen here I think the most joyous occasions are when we as God's people meet together and we sit together in one accord in the things of the Lord but the scripture goes on to say that not only were all the people there it breaks it down in verse two to say all the men and all the women the families were there and verse four reminds us again that the leaders were there all of the leadership just as today we have our steering committee in the front rows the leadership were gathered in a place of prominence because they were in accord with the priority of the ministry of the word of God and then I like what it says in verse three it says in verse three at the end of the verse that those who could understand were there I believe that's a reference to the children those who could comprehend what was going on were gathered there I hope it will never be necessary for us as a church to disseminate our young people and even our junior people out into other places when they can understand the sense of the word they ought to be with God's people in God's house gathered together for the service of worship the Bible says that the whole family was there the men and women were there the leaders were there even the children who could comprehend and understand were there they had the proper assembly oh I believe God is honored and glorified when his people gather together in one accord we will do anything in this church to keep from breaking up God's people into two different congregations if we may come to it someday in the future with two services but God help us to do everything possible before we do that I believe he's honored when we gather in one accord notice also they were gathered with the proper attitudes the Bible says that when they came together for the reading of the word of God that it was at their request that the word of God be brought they said to Ezra the scribe bring us the word we want to hear it and oh you know something anyone can teach the Bible when you have that kind of a spirit among God's people I've said to numerous of you as you've come through the door to have your hand shook or shaken or whatever I should say about that as you leave the service I've said to some of you oh how I love to watch you when I preach because you by your very facial expressions are saying pastor we want the word give us the word and we're excited about it and you have a face that invites the preaching of the word of God and that was the spirit in the attitude of these people they came together with a spirit of expectancy that God would speak to them through his word but the scripture also tells us that they were unified that they came as one man what a tremendous testimony to the unity of that body they came together as one person unified in the things of God in order that the word of God might be taught to them then I have to say just a word about their endurance since ever once in a while around here we have a long and detailed discussion about the length of our services not so much on Sunday morning because we have some time pressures there but once in a while we get carried away on Sunday night I just want you to know that in other places and at other times it's not always been as good as you have it here for in the third verse of the eighth chapter read these words and he read the word facing the street that was before the Watergate from the morning until noon now men and women when you think our services get long just go back to read the eighth chapter of the book of Nehemiah and remember that there was a congregation that had such a love for the word of God that they gathered in the morning and they stayed together until noon and they stayed to hear the word of God something about their endurance had something to say about their attitudes toward the word and then in verse three we're told that the ears of all of the people were attentive to the book of the law they had an attention to what was being said it's interesting as a pastor to wonder at the minds of the people to whom you speak on a given Sunday I suppose some of you have already replayed yesterday's Ohio football game while you've been here this morning some of you are anticipating the one you'll watch this afternoon some of you are thinking about the roast in the oven others if you have gone off on an excursion of a two-day trip you've planned for next month and though you may not think I know that I can almost tell when you're gone I can see you when you come back at least but you know in this text it says that they gathered to hear the word of God and they gave attention to it I like to see people come to church with pencils and paper you know what happens when you write something down it helps you to keep your attention and these people had a love for the word of God they gave themselves to it by their very attention to the teaching of the word and the scripture says in verse five Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people when he opened it the people stood up now let me add that to the picture of endurance suppose on a Sunday evening beginning at seven and ending at a quarter of nine I said now tonight in our service men and women because of our love for the word of God and our determination to give it its proper reference we will stand through the entire service well I'm not going to try that I have better sense than that I recognize we're living in a different age and God has provided some very beautiful and comfortable chairs but I think it is an illustration is it not of the hunger and desire in the part of these people for God's word they had their project done and now they said we want the word we want to get into the word we want to know what God has to say to us I want you to notice also in this text that there's a wonderful presentation of the word of God it's one thing to be on the receiving end and it's another thing to be on the giving end and as I think about your part in the process of the teaching of the word of God I'm also mindful of the responsibilities that all of us who are on the teaching staff have in the dissemination of God's truth first of all I want you to notice a very interesting thing that this is the first use in the entire Bible I think it may be the only use in the entire Bible of the word pulpit where in the world did we ever get such a word it says in the fourth verse that Ezra stood upon a pulpit of wood now you have to understand it in the old days they didn't stand behind the pulpit they stood on top of the pulpit I'm not going to do that either some of you already think I'm crazy I'm not going to remove all doubt the Bible says he stood up on a big podium and he stood on the pulpit and he preached above the people so they could hear and understand and there would be clarity of speech and when you study the text in the seventh chapter and find out how many people it was that he was preaching to you understand why it was important for him to get in a place of prominence and shout forth the word of God as he read the scriptures to his people he not only read the scripture but he taught the scripture and I think that all who aspire to be teachers of the word of God who aspire to be preachers of the word of God can get their signal from God here this is what it means to preach and teach the word of God for the scripture says that he read the scripture in the sight of all the people and in verse 8 so they read in the book of the law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand now that's my job my job as the pastor as the preacher is to read the book and to teach the word and to cause you to understand what God's word has to say now that means that my job isn't to be profound my job isn't to impress you my job isn't to stand up here you use a lot of theological words that nobody understands my job is to take the book and to read it and to speak about it clearly and to give the sense of it so that when you walk out of here you can say pastor I understand what that passage says nobody ever says anything to me that more encourages my heart than when they say to me pastor that was simple enough that I could understand it the reason God blesses the teaching of his word is not that we get up on a high level and understand the New Testament instruction to be feed my giraffes but to feed my sheep and we feed the people so they can understand those of us who have the privilege of going to seminary takes us about five years to get divested of all the theological terms so that the people who are out in the pew know what we're talking about I remember when I was getting ready to go finish my degree looking on my doctorate I sat down with Dr. Haddon Robinson and I said to him do you think I should go ahead with this should I go ahead he said what do you want to do I said well God's call me to preach that's what I want to do he said well for goodness sake don't go get a doctorate I said what do you mean he said you're already four years removed from your people four more isn't going to help you at all but I understood what he meant by that you know something folks in our Sunday school classes and in our pulpits as we preach and as we teach here is the key distinctly to cause people to understand what we've read and to impart to them the sense of the text now that doesn't mean that you don't study or that you have a shoddy attitude toward the teaching of the word of God what it does mean is when you come to the end of the process and you get done they ought to know what the book says they ought not to walk out with an impression of your intellect or your spirituality they ought to walk out with an impression of the Bible I remember reading not too long ago a story about a southern gentleman who just got a degree said he was an orator somebody said son what is an orator now that you are one
[time=3004] he said well let me illustrate he said when you walk up to a common person and you ask him how much is two and two and he says four
[time=3014] then he's not an orator but he said if you ask an orator like me how much is two and
[time=3020] two and I say when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to take the numeral of the second denomination and add it to figure two I say and you without fear of successful contradiction that the result will invariably be four that's an orator now we've got an awful lot of orators in our pulpits these days who don't know how to say two plus two equals four but you know what the more I study the Bible the more I find it to be just that simple somebody said to me one time the reason they're such a mist in the in the pew is because there's such a heavy fog in the pulpit
[time=3058] and I have an idea that much of the misunderstanding and lack of grappling with the text has to do with our teaching method I say to you who are preachers and teachers get the word and then put it down where the people can get a hold of it and make it understandable to them that's what's going to cause them to grow the preparation of the word and the presentation of the word then I want you to notice that the purpose of the word is so beautifully illustrated in the sixth verse we read and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen, amen lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and they worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground. Verse six tells us that the ultimate product of God's word being taught properly understood and comprehended by God's people is that when it's all finished and the preaching is done and the hearing is finished that the result ought to be that God's people will want to give glory to the Lord and that they'll want to say amen. You know we are a culture to congregation and I say that kindly we are professionally oriented people we're cultured and I have an idea that if somebody ever said amen behind you some of you would jump right out of your chair I thank God for a dear friend of mine a brother who's here who's accustomed to saying amen I just want to say to you when you feel like saying amen you go right ahead and say it maybe you'll teach some of our people not to be so cultured in the Bible it says when they agreed with something they said what amen and I don't think that's all bad I think once in a while when you get excited about a spiritual truth you can say amen can't you?
[time=3154] Oh my well I'm going to try better next week I'll tell you that amen and the people said amen they got so excited about God's word that they just lifted up their hearts in a praise and chorus to God and they said great is the Lord not great is Ezra nobody's talking here about the Ezra didn't do anything except read the Bible and explain it but the result of that was that God was glorified and his name lifted up and men and women were brought into a close relationship with the Lord they worshiped and their attitude of worship was one of humility the scripture says that they bowed their faces to the earth may I say to you that the word of God has a two pronged effect upon us number one it causes us to appreciate the greatness of God and secondly it causes us to appreciate our own sinfulness in light of his greatness when we stand in awe of what he has done for us during these days of the together we build program and we consider the wonderful things that he's wrought in our midst it ought to do two things to us it ought to cause us to say oh God how great and Lord how unworthy we are of such a blessing upon this humble congregation I want to say to you that the attitude of worship is the end result of all that we do we start with the word and we end at worship I like the story told of C.I. McIntosh who one day was in his study when he heard the door to his study rattle a little bit and move a little bit he didn't know what it was all about and finally he answered the door and their standing looking up at him was his little boy about three years old and Dr.
[time=3270] McIntosh was like a lot of pastors when he secluded in his study he didn't like to be bothered he was a little bit annoyed that his son had bothered him and kind of gruffly he said young man what are you doing and his little boy said daddy I'm not doing anything I just wanted to look at you do you know when I open the word and when I understand its truth when I come to grips with what it's saying it causes me to want to just open the door of heaven a little bit and look at my Savior not for any purpose not to get anything just to want to gaze upon him and say to Lord I just want to look at you and the Bible says that he is to be found in the scripture men and women the buildings are great the property is wonderful but it's all because we have this that we're so excited about it shall we pray. Father how thankful we are for your word bless it to our hearts cause us to be faithful in the teaching of it and Lord may we never forget that our priority in this place is the declaration of God's truth while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed as we conclude this portion of our service do you know Jesus as your Savior have you come to the understanding of what it means to be a Christian through the word of God you can do it if you will bow right now wherever you are and say Lord Jesus I want you to be my Savior come into my life and forgive my sin and give me the gift of eternal life.
