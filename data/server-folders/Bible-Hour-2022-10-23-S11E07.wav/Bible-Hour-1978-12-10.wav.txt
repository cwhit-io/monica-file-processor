[time=0] - From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present
[time=21] the Bible hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=48] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=55] - And we welcome you to this special service.
[time=57] Those of you who have joined us now by television, it's a thrill for us to be able to share what Christmas is here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church with our many friends.
[time=66] We've gathered here in the Convocation Center for our regular worship service, and we're going to be sharing with you during these moments some of the exciting music of Christmas that is a part of the growing tradition of excellent music here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=82] This is a time when our thoughts turn to Bethlehem, and when our minds are filled with the message of the incarnation, it's exciting to know what that message is, to review once a year
[time=94] at least the first announcement of that message that was made to the shepherds on the hills
[time=100] outside of the city.
[time=102] Today as we open the word in a few moments, we're going to take a new and different look at that message communicated by the angels on that first Christmas Eve.
[time=111] And I trust that your hearts and your Bibles will be open to receive from the Lord that good news that He has for all of us today.
[time=119] Now let's share the music of Christmas with our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger
[time=125] as they sing for us now from the living Christmas tree, the music of the Christmas season.
[time=145] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=191] The day is coming when you grow to be a man, one day your death will then complete salvation's
[time=214] plan.
[time=222] The angels are above you through each lonely night.
[time=239] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=265] [MUSIC]
[time=295] (gentle music)
[time=325] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=523] (orchestral music) [MUSIC - 226 seconds]
[time=757] (upbeat music)
[time=771] [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=880] - We're glad you've joined us today on the Bible Hour,
[time=891] and we thank you for being a part of this very special telecast.
[time=895] We're standing together here in the main auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church at the base of the giant Christmas tree.
[time=903] It's called the Living Christmas Tree, Donna.
[time=905] It's not alive now though, is it?
[time=907] - No, this sure has been the last few days.
[time=910] - We've had the wonderful time of sharing the Christmas story through the singing Christmas tree.
[time=915] Right now there aren't any people in it, but the beautiful green and even the smell of Christmas is in the air here as we've shared together the joy of Christmas, and several thousand people have already been here to share this.
[time=926] We still have a few more concerts to go at the time of this telecast, and we're so excited that we've had the privilege of opening up the doors of our church to share the Christmas story through the Living Christmas Tree presentation.
[time=939] Donna, this is a very special Sunday here.
[time=941] It's the Sunday before Christmas at Black Hawk, and we have a very special presentation that we'd like to share with our very wonderful friends at home, and it has some semblance of a response to the Christmas season.
[time=954] It's a new book that we have just become aware of that is available to you at home, if you will write to us, and the title of the book is, "The Four Gospels, Arranged as a Single Narrative." Now Donna in layman's terms, what does that mean?
[time=970] - It means that you can take this booklet and turn to it, and if you're, for instance, following the life of Christ, all of the miracles are right there together, and you don't have to flip from Matthew to Mark and back to Luke, it's all in chronological order.
[time=986] - That's such a tremendous help.
[time=988] Even thinking through the Christmas story, I always found it hard to figure out the time sequence when I first started studying the Bible between Mary, and the babe, and the wise men, and the shepherds, some of it's recorded in Luke, some of it's recorded in Matthew.
[time=1003] As you open the pages of this booklet, you will start by reading in the book of Luke, and then back to the book of John, and the incarnation, and then back to Matthew, and then back to Luke, but you don't have to be flipping back and forth, because this book is arranged chronologically.
[time=1021] You will be reading the King James version of the scripture, but you will read it as it actually occurred.
[time=1026] When you go to seminary, or when you go to college to study the life of Christ, you end up studying a harmony of the gospels, which puts all of the gospels together.
[time=1036] This is one of the first times I have ever seen anyone accurately put together all of the gospels in one single narrative chronologically.
[time=1045] I think it'll be a great help to our friends at home, don't you?
[time=1048] - I sure do, and also in the back, there's an index.
[time=1051] So if you're looking for a particular miracle or parable, you can turn to the back, and in the index, it will tell you where to find it.
[time=1058] It's very easy for you to get your copy of this booklet.
[time=1061] If you would like it, you may call us at our toll-free number.
[time=1064] That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1069] Ask for the Bible, our operator, and tell her that you would like the booklet on the four gospels.
[time=1075] - That's right, Donna, and I think that this particular time of the year, we have a special joy in making this available free and postage paid to all of our friends.
[time=1083] It's sort of a special Christmas gift to you, if you'll call or write to us, and it's not only good at Christmas time, you'll find this something very helpful as you read through the scriptures during this next year.
[time=1093] It will be a devotional aid to get you into the Word of God for yourself.
[time=1098] We wanna take just a moment to remind our many friends who are listening in the outlying areas that on many of the stations where this telecast is seen today, there will be a special living Christmas tree program that is shown on your station.
[time=1112] We would encourage you to consult a TV guide and your local newspaper for the time of this presentation that will be coming into your homes during this Christmas season.
[time=1123] For those of you here in Fort Wayne, we will be seeing on Sunday night Christmas Eve at 7 p.m. here on channel 21.
[time=1131] And for those of you at the other station, we pray that you will look into your television guide and find the time when we'll be seen in your area, and please be with us for the presentation of the living Christmas tree, a special Christmas gift from us to you as you share the Bible, our ministry at home.
[time=1148] Now, once again, we want to remind you for your free copy of the Four Gospels as a single narrative, this special presentation of the scriptures.
[time=1156] You should call us at 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1161] Tell the Bible Hour operator that you would like to have your free copy of this gift.
[time=1166] And we will send it to you this week.
[time=1168] We have a great stock of them in our office.
[time=1171] We'll be happy to get them out to you just as soon as we can.
[time=1174] If you prefer to write, you may write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, or you may call us at 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1189] Don, I think it would be good if you would express to all of our friends at home who may not see us again before Christmas day, our special wish to them.
[time=1197] - We truly hope that you have a joyous and blessed Christmas and a wonderful new year.
[time=1202] - And I would say, amen to that, and ask that you stay with us now as we get back to our morning service.
[time=1208] (upbeat music)
[time=1235] (singing in foreign language) - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1266] - In just a moment, we're going to sing another Carol,
[time=1272] but before we do, let me just ask you to share with us in prayer as we anticipate the sharing of this presentation of the Living Christmas Tree in a special way with our friends at home.
[time=1286] And we're going to be doing that on Christmas Eve here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1290] We're going to be sharing the story of Christmas in a Christmas Eve television special, which will be seen on channel 21 here locally at seven o'clock next Sunday night.
[time=1303] And of course, we're having an early Vesper service here at Blackhawk so that all of our folks can get home and share this one hour television special.
[time=1311] Our choir will be working diligently on Monday night to put all of this together.
[time=1315] And the special will also be seen in Chicago on channel 38 at eight o'clock on Sunday evening.
[time=1322] And it will be seen in South Bend on channel 46, again at 10 o'clock on Sunday evening, so that all of our friends in the various areas where the Bible Hour is shared will be able to participate in what we believe is one of the unique ministries of our church and the sharing of the Christmas message with the beautiful pageantry of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1341] I hope if you have friends or relatives who live in the areas that I've mentioned, that you'll get the word out to them and tell them to be sure and check the television guides in their area to make sure of the time and station and share with us this special tribute to the Lord Jesus Christ, our incarnate Savior.
[time=1358] Now let's sing again.
[time=1359] Don, let's sing another Christmas Carol before the message.
[time=1362] - And it's in number 114.
[time=1366] The first know well, the angels did say.
[time=1369] In number 114,
[time=1378] every voice singing together.
[time=1380] (upbeat music)
[time=1408] [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=1481] - And thank you for that good singing.
[time=1488] Pastor?
[time=1488] - Will you take your Bibles and turn with me now
[time=1494] to the book of Luke and the second chapter.
[time=1496] Luke, the physician's account of the angelic announcement to the shepherds as they tended their sheep on the hillsides outside of Bethlehem.
[time=1507] Luke chapter two, and I'm reading from the eighth verse,
[time=1513] this very familiar account of this portion of our Lord's birth in narrative.
[time=1522] And there were in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=1529] And lo and angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were very much afraid.
[time=1536] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.
[time=1547] For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a savior which is Christ the Lord.
[time=1554] And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger.
[time=1560] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven that the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us.
[time=1587] And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger.
[time=1592] And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told and by the shepherds.
[time=1603] But Mary kept all of these things and pondered them in her heart.
[time=1608] And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them.
[time=1617] May we pray together.
[time=1619] Father, we have read and heard both in word and in music, this familiar story so many times.
[time=1628] And our prayer today at the outset of this message is that now let's make it fresh and new to us as the Spirit of God illuminates our hearts and minds, that in a sense we may read it as if we had read it for the first time and that the application of its truth will get down to our hearts and to the place where we live.
[time=1650] And Lord, we pray that you will apply this truth to my own heart and to the hearts of those who listen, both here in this auditorium and through the television media to the homes of many who share this hour with us today.
[time=1664] We pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1668] I do not believe there's a more beautiful story in all of the Bible than this story which we have read.
[time=1677] It has been told to little children from the moment they are able to understand and it becomes a familiar truth to us all as we grow up in the Christian tradition.
[time=1687] And yet I wonder if we see it as only a bit of history, a bit of narrative to fill in the gap between the pages of the Bible.
[time=1696] I wonder if we read it just for the account that it gives to us of our Savior's birth and the enunciation to the shepherds.
[time=1703] Or if we see in it the truths that are applicable to our own lives as Christians.
[time=1709] I want us today as we study this familiar passage for just a moment to put aside the historical sequence and to appeal to the narrative that is here as if it were something we were all experiencing ourselves.
[time=1726] To put ourselves, as it were, in the place of the shepherds, to put ourselves into the situation as we see the truths of this story apply to our own hearts in this Christmas season.
[time=1736] There are in any narrative a few of the various
[time=1742] and sundry sections that we need to study and we will take it as if we were studying it as literature and we will apply ourselves to the various nuances of the story and let them speak to our own hearts today.
[time=1755] First of all, I think you need to understand that in this first announcement, there was an audience to the enunciation.
[time=1762] The scripture says that that audience was made up of shepherds.
[time=1766] The eighth verse of the second chapter says that there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field.
[time=1773] Now I think it will be very easy for us as we apply this truth to our own hearts to identify with the first audience to hear the gospel message from the angels concerning our Lord's birth.
[time=1784] They were shepherds, according to the scripture.
[time=1787] They did not represent the aristocracy of their day, but rather they were lowly, humble, poor shepherds.
[time=1795] Almost as if an immediate fulfillment of that which was recorded, and as we know, as Mary's Magnificent found in the first chapter of the Book of Luke, these shepherds represented the kinds of audiences to whom Jesus would be proclaimed down through the ages of history.
[time=1811] If you have your Bibles, will you turn back to the first chapter of the Book of Luke?
[time=1815] And let me read for you the words which Mary gave in prophecy concerning that which was to happen in her own life in the birth of the Savior.
[time=1825] We read in verse 51 of chapter one, "He hath shown great strength with his arm.
[time=1830] "He hath scattered the proud in the imagination "of their hearts.
[time=1834] "He hath put down the mighty from their seats "and exalted them of low degree.
[time=1840] "He hath filled the hungry with good things "and the rich he hath sent away empty.
[time=1845] "Mary prophesied that the message of Jesus Christ "would be preached to them of low degree.
[time=1851] "And here in the first announcement of our Savior's coming, "we see the lowly shepherds gathered on the hillside, "representing the lowly of mankind, "and God chose to speak to them first "about his Savior's birth.
[time=1866] "I like to enter in a little bit to the mystery of that night.
[time=1869] "I sense it was a quiet night, "a time perhaps of loneliness for the shepherds.
[time=1876] "I don't know if you've ever studied the Christmas message "with a view to the loneliness "that seems to be a part of it.
[time=1882] "I think perhaps I'm more aware of that "during this season of the year "because as I talk with people, "I discover that at this time of the year, "there are so many who are lonely." But will you notice that even in the nuance of this story, there is the majesty of loneliness.
[time=1899] The shepherds gathered outside the hill away from their homes.
[time=1904] A little bit later in the narrative, we read of the kings who came away from their homes to worship at the manger.
[time=1912] It's interesting that the shepherds left, that the angels left Heaven's glory.
[time=1916] They left their home to come and announce this message to the shepherds.
[time=1921] Mary and Joseph had left their home and had come to Bethlehem because of the taxation rule, there to be registered in the place of David.
[time=1930] And throughout the city of Bethlehem, were hundreds of people who were away from home who had gathered there to be registered according to the government.
[time=1940] And then what shall we say about the Lord Jesus Christ who was born that night in Bethlehem?
[time=1945] He himself left home.
[time=1947] Did you ever stop to think about the fact that the Christmas story was a story that was filled with people away from home?
[time=1954] People who experienced in that situation the loneliness that so many wonderful people experienced at this season of the year.
[time=1961] Jesus Christ was announced to the shepherds on a lonely hill and God in Heaven in his omniscient sovereign will chose that the announcement would be made to such folks as that.
[time=1973] That no lonely person who ever experiences the Christmas holidays may ever feel left out, but rather that the message might in some special way have a special significance to them.
[time=1985] The audience was an audience of lonely people away from their home out on the hillside in the darkness.
[time=1992] The setting was one of darkness.
[time=1994] It was a nighttime scene, and it reminds us that this message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is spoken today in the midst of darkness.
[time=2004] Historians tell us that when Jesus was born, there had been up until that time no darker hour in the history of the Roman Empire.
[time=2013] The heathenism of the day had reached a rampant scene and everywhere there was loneliness.
[time=2021] Judaism seemed to be failing and that's why I believe that Paul wrote to the Galatians in the fourth chapter that in the fullness of time, God sent forth his son.
[time=2030] It was a time of darkness both physically and politically and socially and in every other way.
[time=2036] And Jesus came into that darkness and the shepherds in the darkness of that night represent the dark human hearts of all mankind until they hear of Jesus Christ.
[time=2045] It was a message of light in the midst of darkness.
[time=2050] Then I believe it was a message of ignorance, a message of sorrow, a message to sin, a message to death, a message to all of those very difficult things that were part of that time, a message that came to the shepherds when they were experiencing all of the difficult emotions of life and it was a message of hope for the first time that something good might happen in their lives.
[time=2074] This was the kind of audience to whom Jesus Christ was first preached.
[time=2081] As I reflect upon the Christmas season and the kind of message that we have to preach, I'm reminded of the fact that perhaps never in the history of mankind have there been more needy people, more people who experienced the darkness of life than there are today.
[time=2095] What a joy it is to come as did the angels that night and find such a group to whom we may speak in our world around us as neighbors and those with whom we work and to say to them, hey, have a good news for you.
[time=2108] Jesus is born and there is light and there is hope and there's something for you to look forward to because Christ has come into the world.
[time=2117] That was the audience and I'm so glad it was such an audience.
[time=2119] If it had been those of the aristocracy, the royalty of the day, some of us may have looked at that particular situation and said, oh, yes, Jesus was born for the high and for the proud, but he came to exhibit his love and his life, first of all, to the shepherds of low degree.
[time=2138] The great shepherd announced first to shepherds.
[time=2142] But I have it have you think secondly in this beautiful story, not only of the audience, but let's notice for a moment the angels.
[time=2151] We read in verse 13 and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, God chose the angels to announce the birth of Christ.
[time=2164] In the book of Hebrews, we're told that angels are ministering spirits sent forth from God.
[time=2170] And the scripture tells us here that there were a multitude of angels who announced the birth of Christ.
[time=2177] Once in a while in our pictures of the Christmas story, we picture five or six angels who have come from heaven to announce the birth of Christ.
[time=2185] But as I study the scripture, whenever a multitude of angels is referenced, it's always many more angels than just a few.
[time=2191] And as I understand the scripture, the picture that I get is that the heavens were just crowded with angels, that everywhere you looked were angels.
[time=2199] Over in the book of Revelation, for instance, we read of another multitude of angels, and there we get some insight into the number involved.
[time=2207] We read in the book of Revelation these words, I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures are the elders, and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000, and thousands of thousands.
[time=2224] So I picture that night in Bethlehem that as the shepherds were out in the lonely field, it wasn't just two or three angels that frightened them that night, but it was the realization that the heavens were filled with multitudes of angels who had been set forth from God to announce that Jesus Christ was coming.
[time=2241] No wonder the scripture said they were afraid for the brightness and brilliance of the angelic presence caused them to fear.
[time=2249] I'm interested in the fact that God so wonderfully used angels in the Christmas narrative.
[time=2256] It was an angel who told Zacharias about the birth of John who was to prefigure the Lord Jesus.
[time=2262] It was an angel who came to marry and told her about the birth of Jesus that was so unique.
[time=2268] It was an angel that spoke to Joseph through a dream and explained to him the uncommon circumstances of the woman to whom he was engaged, and it was the angels who came that night to announce the birth of Jesus to the shepherds.
[time=2283] You see, angels are God's heralds.
[time=2285] It's interesting as you study the language of the New Testament that the word herald is the real meaning of the word angel.
[time=2293] Now I want to say that that word is also used on occasion to refer to those who preach the gospel.
[time=2299] That is the only way I could ever make any claim to an angelic likeness through the nuances of the New Testament language.
[time=2307] The word angel and the word preacher are coming from common roots.
[time=2311] That has nothing to do with the character or conduct of the one who preaches.
[time=2315] It has everything to do with the message that is heralded forth.
[time=2319] The word angel really means one who is sent to declare the good news.
[time=2324] And the angels were chosen because they came as ministering spirits from God in heaven to declare to all mankind that Jesus Christ had come, and they did come to save them from their sin.
[time=2336] As you study about the angels in the Bible, you learn that the angels were reserved by God in heaven for very special purposes.
[time=2344] It puts the incarnation of Christ in a special unique category.
[time=2348] We're told in the book of Job that when the world was created, the angels sang.
[time=2353] We're told in the Bible that when a soul is converted to Jesus Christ, Luke chapter 15, that the angels rejoice.
[time=2362] And we're told in this passage that when Jesus was born, the angels came.
[time=2367] And we're told in the Bible that when Jesus is exalted, the angels sing.
[time=2372] That does a lot for me.
[time=2373] First of all, it puts conversion in a very unique category.
[time=2377] It reminds me that God thinks the salvation of a soul is so important that He treats it with the same kind of reverence with which the birth of Christ was treated.
[time=2388] But it also shows me the significance of this event for God sent forth His angels to be present to announce that wonderful message.
[time=2398] Angels are God's heralds, God's preachers, the highest order of messengers in all of the world.
[time=2405] And their message is a symbol and an example for all gospel messages.
[time=2411] It was a short, pointed, comprehensive presentation of the truth that the shepherds could not help but understand.
[time=2418] Well, that's the audience, the shepherds, the lowly ones.
[time=2421] And those are the angels who were a part of this story, representing the gospel preachers who go throughout the land, teaching and preaching the Word of God.
[time=2430] But now let's for a moment examine the announcement which was made.
[time=2435] We read of that announcement in verses 13 and 14 of this chapter.
[time=2439] And suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, glory to God in the highest and on earth.
[time=2449] Peace, goodwill toward men.
[time=2452] Will you notice, first of all, that message that the angels spoke.
[time=2457] And by the way, maybe I will ruin a tradition for you if I say this.
[time=2462] I haven't been able to find any place in all of the Bible where it says that the angels sang.
[time=2468] We assume that they did.
[time=2469] And choir members, we'll let you get by with that this year.
[time=2474] We know that they must have sang because we've been doing it ever since we can remember.
[time=2481] But the scripture says the angels said unto them, saying is the word that's used.
[time=2487] Well, however they did it through music or through spoken word, the angels praised God.
[time=2492] They communicated the message.
[time=2494] And first of all, it was a message of praise.
[time=2496] It was a song of praise.
[time=2498] The scripture says, glory to God were their words.
[time=2503] They did not come to glorify themselves nor to glorify the shepherds, but they came as representatives of God's glory.
[time=2510] And their first words were glory to God, a song of praise.
[time=2515] But it was also a song of peace.
[time=2517] They said, this message which we bring is good tidings.
[time=2521] It is a message of goodwill to all men of peace on earth.
[time=2525] Little did the shepherds understand what that meant, but it must have brought some glimmer of hope to their hearts as they saw around them the hostility of a bad world situation.
[time=2534] And the word peace was like music to their ears.
[time=2537] The same is true for us as we hear the message today.
[time=2540] Every part of the world seems to be in some jeopardy of war, of hostility, the Middle East peace, which has been so long, hope for seems to be in jeopardy.
[time=2552] And we hear men everywhere crying, peace, peace, and there is no peace, but I want to tell you something.
[time=2556] Jesus Christ brings peace.
[time=2559] Maybe not to the outward world in its situation, but he brings a better peace than that.
[time=2563] He brings a peace to the hearts of men.
[time=2566] And I don't believe they'll ever be peace on this globe until men everywhere have the prince of peace living in their heart.
[time=2572] We're looking forward to that age in the future when Jesus will be king and peace will reign supreme.
[time=2578] But oh, in the meantime, we can have the peace that passive understanding in our own lives and in our own hearts as the prince of peace comes to live within us.
[time=2586] Their message was a message of praise.
[time=2588] It was a message of peace.
[time=2591] But I want you to know that it was a message of purpose, too.
[time=2594] The purpose of their coming was goodwill toward men.
[time=2598] And that is not just a wonderful feeling about the brotherhood.
[time=2601] That is a message of goodwill that is extended to all men everywhere if they will accept God's wonderful plan of salvation.
[time=2609] That goodwill is the kind of goodwill that comes into a heart that has received Jesus Christ as Savior, a song of praise, a song of peace, a song of purpose.
[time=2621] Let's examine it even more carefully.
[time=2623] This message which came was, as I've already intimated, a message of light in the midst of darkness.
[time=2630] Have you ever stopped to contemplate the fact that Jesus life on this earth both began and ended in darkness.
[time=2638] He was born in the midnight darkness.
[time=2641] And the scripture says that as he hung upon the cross, it was dark upon the face of the whole earth.
[time=2648] I'm certain that we cannot comprehend what the light penetrating the darkness meant on that night.
[time=2654] The scripture is clear that the light that filled the heavens was the glory of God.
[time=2658] In the language of the Bible, that was the Shekinah glory, the glory representing the holiness of God.
[time=2665] That glory had not been seen in Israel since it departed from the temple recorded way back in the middle of the Old Testament.
[time=2672] There had been a long siege of darkness.
[time=2674] And all of a sudden, the glory that had little by little departed from the temple is recorded in the Old Testament.
[time=2680] Now it again appeared in the New Testament.
[time=2683] That long silent period when there was no voice from God was broken.
[time=2687] And Jesus Christ filled the heavens with His glory.
[time=2690] And the darkness was obliterated.
[time=2695] It was not only a message of light in the darkness, but it was also a message of comfort in the midst of anxiety.
[time=2701] Isn't it interesting how many times the message of fear not is found in the Bible?
[time=2707] God always comes to bring comfort to the anxious.
[time=2710] And in this Christmas season, when the anxiety just of the season seems to surround us, when we're encompassed by all of the hustle and bustle of the season, I believe the angels would come to us with the message from the word of God, fear not.
[time=2724] Do not be filled with anxiety for the Prince of Peace is here.
[time=2728] He has come to dispel your anxiety.
[time=2732] It was also a message of hope in the time of despair.
[time=2736] The Bible says in verse 10, these words, "The angels sent it to them, fear not.
[time=2740] For behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people." And that's why we read in the book of Galatians again, that it was at the fullness of time at just the right hour Jesus Christ came forth.
[time=2754] Finally, this message, this announcement, was a message of salvation to the lost.
[time=2763] I have been saying in our living Christmas tree concerts that all of the story of Christmas is the story of salvation.
[time=2770] Throughout the history of this particular book in the narrative of Christ, consistently, Jesus Christ is prophesied and announced and heralded as a Savior.
[time=2781] Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
[time=2785] This was a message of salvation.
[time=2789] One of the interesting things to me about the birth of Christ, which does not often meet the eye when we first study it, is the significant comparison and contrast between his birth and his death.
[time=2803] I don't believe I've ever read about any other man who was ever born, that he was born a Savior.
[time=2811] That's what the Scripture says.
[time=2813] "For unto you is born this day a Savior." I would read the announcement of my children and I would say, "Born to me is a baby.
[time=2821] Born to me is a son.
[time=2823] Born to me is a daughter.
[time=2824] But this record, this birth announcement said, "Born this day is a Savior." And all that was wrapped up in that announcement pointed to Calvary for his Saviorhood would take him from the cradle to the cross.
[time=2836] He was born to die.
[time=2838] Never has ever such a man been born.
[time=2841] Born for the purpose of death.
[time=2842] Oh, it's certain that all of us are born, and ultimately we will die.
[time=2846] But who do you know that was born for the express purpose of death?" Yeah, that was the purpose of our Savior's birth.
[time=2854] He was born a Savior.
[time=2858] Interestingly enough, he came into the world as a helpless, unknowing child.
[time=2864] And the Bible says that when he died, he went to his death as a lamb to the slaughter.
[time=2871] And as a sheep before his shearers is dumb.
[time=2876] Jesus Christ was led even as a little baby into his death experience.
[time=2882] And as he came into this world, unknowing as a babe, the Scripture says in Isaiah chapter 53, that like a little lamb, he was led to the slaughter and he was slain.
[time=2893] Jesus Christ was born in a cradle that was not his own.
[time=2899] It was not even that which pertained to mankind.
[time=2902] It was the borrowed feeding trough of some unknown inn in Bethlehem.
[time=2908] It was not his.
[time=2910] And the Scripture records that when he died, he was buried in a tomb that did not belong to him.
[time=2916] A tomb borrowed from Joseph of Eremathea.
[time=2920] The Bible says that Jesus Christ was born in the darkness just after midnight.
[time=2926] And he died in the darkness when darkness was over the whole land.
[time=2931] He was born on a hard couch in that which was a part of the stable furniture of his day.
[time=2938] So often our pictures of the manger show him bedded down in the hay.
[time=2942] I'm not sure that it was quite that comfortable.
[time=2944] He may have been laid upon the hard couch of that manger.
[time=2950] And the Scripture says that when he died, he went to the hardwood cross there to be stretched out for our sins.
[time=2957] He was born according to the Scripture between two animals.
[time=2961] For the prophecy of his coming says that an oxidant ass were with him.
[time=2966] And he died that day on Calvary, stretched out between two thieves, one on either side.
[time=2974] His birth and his death have a strange mystery about them.
[time=2979] As if to say, Jesus Christ was born to die.
[time=2985] When I first hear that, and when I first feel that in my soul, when I first began to understand that there is something of sadness, how could you rejoice over a little baby being born for the purpose of going to the cross to die?
[time=3001] And yet when I think upon it fully, and when I comprehend it, and when I see what that means to me as one of God's created children, I understand that it is not a message of sadness, but oh, it's a message of gladness.
[time=3017] Had he not been born to die, I would have born ultimately to death.
[time=3023] But because he was born a savior, born to die, now I can be born to live, and someday I shall stand with him forever in eternity because he was willing to be born to die.
[time=3036] He made it possible for me to be born to live.
[time=3039] And so the sadness is dispelled by the gladness of my own personal enrichment in the life of Jesus Christ.
[time=3046] And that was the announcement.
[time=3049] We have looked in this story at the audience, the lowly shepherds.
[time=3053] We have examined the angels who spoke the message.
[time=3057] We have briefly contemplated the announcement that was made on that night.
[time=3062] Could we for just a moment consider the acceptance?
[time=3067] The scripture says that the shepherds who heard it
[time=3073] gave attention to it.
[time=3075] They acknowledged it as the truth, verses 15 and 16 says, and it came to pass when the angels were gone away from them, that the shepherds said one to another, let's go and see this which we have heard.
[time=3086] They did not debate its truth.
[time=3087] They did not argue about it.
[time=3089] They did not seek a dialogue with the angels.
[time=3091] They said, this is truth.
[time=3093] We have heard it and we go to find out that truth as it has come to pass.
[time=3098] They accepted it as theirs.
[time=3101] And they announced it to others.
[time=3105] May I say to you today as you listen to this message, you are the audience.
[time=3109] God has allowed me to be the herald, the announcer.
[time=3114] This book contains the message and you've heard it as it has been proclaimed.
[time=3119] And I wonder, today as you hear this story, will there be an acceptance?
[time=3125] Will you do as the shepherds did as they heard the gospel story for the first time?
[time=3130] Will you accept that message?
[time=3132] Will you go forward to see that message be true in your own life?
[time=3136] Will you come as the shepherds did to the babe Christ, now to the risen Christ?
[time=3142] And will you accept that Christ as your personal savior?
[time=3145] Will you receive him?
[time=3147] Will you make the truth of Christmas personally applicable to your own life?
[time=3151] Several months ago, Don and I had the privilege
[time=3157] of going to Bethlehem.
[time=3159] And there is so much paganism that has grown up about the Holy Land these days.
[time=3165] If you've been there, you understand that though there's much beauty, there's much paganism there.
[time=3170] Located in the Holy Land is what according to historians
[time=3177] the oldest church known to man.
[time=3180] It is called the Church of the Nativity.
[time=3183] It was built by Queen Halina.
[time=3185] And it is a monument, a museum to the birth of Christ.
[time=3191] The room itself is something like 100 by 70, not a huge room, but not a small one.
[time=3199] There is the grotto where they say Christ was born
[time=3205] in the cave.
[time=3206] And it's interesting to me as I've reflected upon that place, that though it is a relatively large room, in order for you to get where they say Christ was born, you have to stoop down and go through a little door to get where the manger is and you can only go in one at a time.
[time=3225] And as I thought about that and all of the paganism that probably has grown up with it, I can't vouch for the fact that that was the place where it happened.
[time=3235] I was reminded that even those who constructed such a museum gave a wonderful testimony of how men and women come to the Christ.
[time=3244] They come, do they not?
[time=3245] Through the door of salvation, one at a time.
[time=3249] You cannot come by families.
[time=3251] You cannot come as a couple.
[time=3253] You cannot join arms and make a group decision.
[time=3256] You must come to the Savior one at a time.
[time=3260] Right now, wherever you hear this message in this auditorium as you listen on television, if you will come to the Christ child, if you will come to the Savior, you must come one at a time.
[time=3273] You must come through that door of salvation and receive him and you can do it today.
[time=3277] Let me say something to you.
[time=3279] If you will make room in your heart for the Savior, he has promised to make room in his heaven for you.
[time=3287] Shall we pray?
[time=3291] Just before we conclude this part of our service, if you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior, will you invite him into your heart today?
[time=3299] Will you receive him as your Savior?
[time=3301] Will you pray right now?
[time=3302] Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[time=3304] I accept you.
[time=3306] I want you to be mine and accept him right now by prayer.
[time=3310] And then if you do it, will you let us know so that we can encourage you and send you some material that will be of help to you as you grow in Christ?
[time=3318] And now, Father, as we conclude this time together around the Word, may our hearts be filled and encouraged with the wonderful message of the gospel here contained in the Scripture.
[time=3334] And if there are those who do not know Christ, we would pray that today would be the moment of decision for them.
[time=3339] May they invite Christ into their heart, into their life, one at a time, to receive him, and to give him a room, to give him room in their life, that he in turn might promise and keep his promise to make room for them in his heaven.
[time=3354] We pray this in Jesus' name.
