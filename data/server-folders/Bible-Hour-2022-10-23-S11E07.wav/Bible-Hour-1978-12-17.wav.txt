[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=16] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=35] And thank you for the good singing, you may be seated.
[time=43] And we welcome you to the Christmas service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=48] All of us gathered here in the Convocation Center, it is the day before Christmas.
[time=53] For those who are joining us by television away from the Fort Wayne area, the service is delayed, but we trust that you will enter into the spirit of this season with us as we rejoice in the birth of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=66] One of the great names for the Lord Jesus is the name Immanuel, Emmanuel.
[time=74] We think of that at Christmas time, perhaps more than at any other time of the year, but it is a word for all seasons.
[time=81] And today as we open the Scripture, we shall be sharing together how that the Lord Jesus has come to be Immanuel in our lives who know him, how he longs to be Immanuel to everyone
[time=93] to whom the message has been proclaimed.
[time=96] We thank you for joining with us, and we trust that this will be an hour of great blessing and encouragement to you.
[time=102] Will you listen now as the Word of God is read to us by our Minister of Youth, Mr. Rick Hawks.
[time=114] This morning I would like to read for you Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7 which read, "For unto
[time=122] us a child is born unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders,
[time=131] and his name shall be called the Wonderful, the Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting
[time=138] Father, the Prince of Peace.
[time=142] Of the increase of his government and peace, there shall be no end, upon the throne of
[time=148] David, and upon the Kingdom, to order it and to establish it with justice and with righteousness,
[time=156] from henceforth even forevermore.
[time=160] The zeal of the Lord of Host will perform this." I have read for you today Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7.
[time=174] In these past days we have been celebrating the Christmas season together by gathering around the giant Christmas tree and listening to the music of the Christmas season.
[time=184] We are so grateful for the tremendous response we have had this year to the Living Christmas Tree presentation, and it is becoming a tradition that on the service after the Living Christmas
[time=195] Tree presentations have been concluded that our teenage young people gather in the Christmas tree to share with us additional music of the season.
[time=204] We're so happy to present them to you today.
[time=206] The young people of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, as they sing to us now the music of Christmas, God's gift of love in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=230] We are so grateful for the lives of the living.
[time=1173] We are so grateful for the living.
[time=1641] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example,
[time=1647] was minded to put her away privately.
[time=1650] But while he thought on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying, "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife,
[time=1661] for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1667] And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying, "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which being interpreted is God with us.
[time=1695] Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did his the angel of the Lord, had bitten him and took unto him his wife, and knew her not until she had brought forth her first born son, and he called his name Jesus, shall we pray.
[time=1712] Our Father, we thank you today for this clear presentation and record of the birth of Jesus
[time=1719] Christ.
[time=1721] We thank our Father for the miraculous way in which it is tied to the Old Testament prophecies of Isaiah.
[time=1728] As we look at it from our vantage point, in the Age of Grace in 1978, we are excited
[time=1735] to know that that one about whom Isaiah wrote, and the record recorded by Matthew is the
[time=1741] one whom we have come to know as our personal Savior, and who indeed is with us, yea, who
[time=1747] even lives within us because we have accepted him into our lives and into our hearts.
[time=1754] We thank you, our Father, for the wondrous names of Christ.
[time=1758] They speak to us, each and every one of them.
[time=1761] We would pray that today as we look at this one singular name, and as we apply the truth of that name to our own hearts that you would bless each and every one of us and speak to our hearts, we understand our Father this to be a season of the year when there are many lonely people, many people who are hurting, and we would ask that you would speak to each individual at the point of their need, draw them close unto thyself, may the result of our fellowship in the word be that men and women, boys and girls, young people, will be drawn closer to the Lord Jesus Christ, perhaps some even to find Him as their Savior and accept
[time=1797] Him as their Lord.
[time=1798] We pray in Jesus' name, and for His sake, amen.
[time=1804] There are many wonderful names for the Lord in the Bible.
[time=1810] Some have taken the time to go through all of the Scripture and list all of the names that are given to Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus of the New.
[time=1819] Isaiah's prophecy, which was read for us a few moments ago by Mr. Hawks, records some of the most familiar of those names.
[time=1827] Isaiah said that his name should be called Wonderful, Counselor.
[time=1832] He would be called the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.
[time=1839] He is called in the New Testament by the most precious name which relates to his humanity.
[time=1845] He is called Jesus.
[time=1848] He is referred to as the Christ, the Messiah.
[time=1852] But I suppose if I had to choose one of the names to which I most often turn, one of the
[time=1858] names which means most to me as an individual, as a Christian, I would select that name which
[time=1864] in reality is not a name.
[time=1866] I would select that name Emmanuel.
[time=1869] Interestingly enough in the New Testament, though the Scripture says his name shall be called Emmanuel, they will call his name Emmanuel, to my knowledge he was never referred to by that name.
[time=1881] And as you do some study into the context of the Word and the Hebrew meaning of the Word, you discover that the Word Emmanuel is not so much a name as it is a characteristic.
[time=1892] It is a word which describes not so much who Jesus is but what he is, not so much his person
[time=1900] as his ministry, not so much that which we would call him, but that which we would come
[time=1907] to know him as in our own personal experience.
[time=1911] My own poet has represented the Son of God as having the stars for his crown, the sky
[time=1918] for his mantle and the clouds for his bow.
[time=1922] The fire is his spear according to the poet.
[time=1926] He rode forth in his majestic robes of glory throughout eternity past in the heavens above.
[time=1934] But one day he resolved in conference with the Holy Trinity to come to this earth and
[time=1941] to shed his clothes on the way.
[time=1944] The stars were gone, the sky was shed, the clouds he divested.
[time=1952] And one according to the tradition asked him what he would wear when he came to this earth
[time=1960] and according to the tradition which has no biblical background but a tradition.
[time=1964] He was said to have replied with a smile that he had new clothes in the making down below
[time=1972] and that those clothes were the clothes of humanity, the robes of flesh and blood.
[time=1980] In fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah, God came to walk among men.
[time=1986] It is almost incomprehensible when we think of it.
[time=1990] It almost goes beyond our ability to think through the process of it all when we comprehend
[time=1997] the fact that God came to be with us.
[time=2000] I have been interested as I have read the New Testament to discover how personal all of these messages are.
[time=2007] If you read the Christmas story you will discover that the Christmas story is very clear about the fact that he is born unto us.
[time=2015] Or unto you is born this day a Savior, traced through that theme in the New Testament and
[time=2021] you will hear in one of the early messages of the apostles as recorded in the book of Acts that unto us he has come first unto us he has been raised up.
[time=2034] In the book of Peter we are told that unto you which believe he is precious.
[time=2038] I am so grateful today as a minister of the gospel that the Christmas story is not just
[time=2044] a historical narrative that we study at one certain time of the year.
[time=2049] Like we read the stories that have come to mean so much to us in our American history.
[time=2054] But it is a story which is the record of God involving himself with man.
[time=2060] It is the story, the record, the actual history of that moment when God left heaven and he
[time=2066] came to be with man, God with us.
[time=2073] But I am more excited than I have ever been about the fact that when he came at Bethlehem
[time=2079] he did not come there to end his presence with man he came there to begin his ever wonderful
[time=2086] presence with us in a new and different ministry than had ever been experienced before by humanity.
[time=2093] What does it mean when the Bible clearly says both in the words of Isaiah and recorded by Matthew that God is with us as Emmanuel?
[time=2103] Well first of all it means that God is with us, that is he is on our side.
[time=2108] He is on our team if I could use that word.
[time=2111] The Bible presents nature as saying that God is above us.
[time=2117] Whenever we think about God we think about looking upward.
[time=2120] God is above us as nature.
[time=2122] The law says that God is against us, that we are answerable to a holy God and because
[time=2129] we have so defiled that law that God has become against us.
[time=2135] We are against God.
[time=2136] We need to be reconciled according to the law.
[time=2139] But the gospel says that God is with us.
[time=2142] Nature says he is above us.
[time=2143] The law says he is against us but the gospel says God is with us.
[time=2149] God is with us, that is he is on our side.
[time=2153] But I want you to notice secondly that God is with us, that is he is in our nature.
[time=2157] The Bible says that the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[time=2163] That means that he became one of us.
[time=2166] God became a humanity, a part of humanity.
[time=2169] God became a man just like the men who are present in this building today.
[time=2175] God became one of us.
[time=2176] He became flesh and blood.
[time=2178] God is with us as a human being.
[time=2182] But thirdly, God is with us to deal with our sin.
[time=2188] He became sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of Christ, God with us.
[time=2195] If God had not come to be with us, he could not have released us from the penalty of sin,
[time=2201] where he had to go as a man and as the God-man to die, and because he was with us, he could
[time=2207] release us from our sin.
[time=2209] God is with us in the release from our sin.
[time=2214] When I think of that term Emmanuel, I am reminded of ever so many truths which are germane to it.
[time=2219] I am reminded that all that God was in his attributes is now available to me because
[time=2225] of his presence with me.
[time=2227] When I say Emmanuel, I mean that omnipotence is with us.
[time=2232] God the all-powerful dwells among us.
[time=2235] When I say Emmanuel, I say omniscience is with us.
[time=2239] God the all-knowing dwells among men.
[time=2242] When I say Emmanuel, I say that perfection is with us.
[time=2246] God the absolute good dwells among us.
[time=2250] When I say Emmanuel, I say eternity is with us.
[time=2254] The one who knows no beginning nor no end, who is described in the Bible as the eternal I am, that one dwells with us.
[time=2263] God is with us Emmanuel.
[time=2265] The most unbelievable of all of the truths of the Bible that I comprehend is the mystery of God in Christ, God dwelling in Christ, and God dwelling with men.
[time=2276] He is, as someone has written, the Creator in a crib.
[time=2280] He is the here, not there in the experience of the omnipresent.
[time=2285] He puts hunger in the body of the one who stored earth's grains.
[time=2289] This truth of God with us is one of the great truths of the Bible.
[time=2294] What do you say, Pastor?
[time=2297] What does that mean to me?
[time=2299] How can I grab hold of the handles of that truth and make that work in my own life?
[time=2304] What does it mean that God is with us, that He is with me?
[time=2307] Some of you listening to my voice today perhaps never have felt so much of forlorn and forsaken
[time=2313] by God as you do at this moment.
[time=2316] Maybe you have never felt so distant from the presence of God as you do during this time, during this season.
[time=2322] There is something about the Christmas season that if we do not have warmth and fellowship and love from our family, we can feel oh so alone.
[time=2330] I want to say to you that the Bible says God is with us.
[time=2333] If you know Christ as your personal Savior, whatever your circumstances, the Bible says God is with you.
[time=2339] God is present with us.
[time=2341] When you stand and look at the manger and all of the experiences of the past, all of
[time=2347] the hope of the future, all of it is wrapped up in the truth that God is now with us.
[time=2353] How may I apply that to your life?
[time=2357] Apart from the Christmas season, apart from the season of the year when we think of the advent of Christ, of His birth, of His incarnation, what truths can we draw from this wonderful
[time=2367] truth of Emmanuel, the characteristic nature of the Lord who is transcendent, who is eminent,
[time=2374] who is God with us?
[time=2377] Let me suggest a few.
[time=2379] First of all, isn't it interesting that the Scripture tells us there's never a time when
[time=2385] God ceases to be with us?
[time=2389] Because I talk with people who suffer from insomnia.
[time=2394] I don't have that problem.
[time=2396] Thank the Lord.
[time=2396] In fact, my wife gets quite angry with me about the ease with which I fall asleep.
[time=2403] She may have worked all day and be dead tired and it will take her a half hour to go to sleep and I'm gone, just like that.
[time=2410] In fact, I have a habit of listening to the radio at night.
[time=2413] And sometimes I'll turn the radio on because I just love to listen to it, but I never hear more than three or four notes.
[time=2419] And then she'll go on listening to it throughout the night, wonder if I'm awake or sleep and it'll keep her awake half the night.
[time=2425] But you know, there are some people that suffer from insomnia.
[time=2427] That must be a terrible thing not to be able to sleep.
[time=2430] And you know, I know some folks who are very afraid at night.
[time=2434] Bill Pierce, who has a program called Night Watch, says that quite often he gets letters
[time=2440] from people who listen to him at night because they can't go to sleep.
[time=2444] They're afraid.
[time=2445] They're fearful.
[time=2446] I found a wonderful promise in the Word of God that reminds us that God is with us in our sleep.
[time=2452] God is with us when we lay our head upon the pillow.
[time=2455] It is found over in the Psalms in Psalm chapter four and verse eight.
[time=2459] Let me just share it with you.
[time=2461] It is an Immanuel promise for this year.
[time=2463] Will you write it down and will you consider it?
[time=2466] It says this, "I will both lie down in peace and sleep, for thou, Lord, only makeest me
[time=2473] to dwell in safety.
[time=2476] I will lie down in peace and sleep, for thou, Lord, makeeth me to dwell in safety."
[time=2485] God is with us when we sleep.
[time=2487] That's a simple truth.
[time=2489] I'm almost embarrassed to share it with you, but it's a wonderful truth, is it not?
[time=2493] You who are elderly that may be afraid when the night hours come and the darkness comes over the earth and you lock your doors, let me say something to you.
[time=2501] If you know God, he's promised to be with you in your sleep.
[time=2504] He is Immanuel at nighttime.
[time=2507] God with us when we sleep.
[time=2510] There's another promise that's a wonderful promise found in the thirteenth chapter of the book of Hebrews.
[time=2514] It is also recorded elsewhere in the Bible in different terms, but it is this promise,
[time=2521] Hebrews chapter 13, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say,
[time=2528] 'The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what men shall do unto me.'
[time=2534] Here is the eternal Immanuel.
[time=2536] I will never leave thee, I will never forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, 'The Lord
[time=2542] is my helper, and I will not fear what men shall do unto me,' Hebrews 13, 3, and 6.
[time=2551] The Bible says that Immanuel is not an Immanuel who is with us at one time more than at another.
[time=2556] He is with us equally at all times.
[time=2559] If I go to the desert where there is no vegetation and nothing grows, God is there.
[time=2565] If I put myself upon a ship at sea and go out to the very center of the ocean where I can see nothing but water on all sides, God is there.
[time=2575] If I go into the jet and I fly to the highest heavens beyond the sight of earth in the midst
[time=2582] of that solitude, God is there.
[time=2586] Let me dive to the depths of the ocean, and He is there.
[time=2589] Whether shall I flee from thy presence,' wrote the psalmist, 'Immanuel is God with us at
[time=2595] all times in every situation, whatever the circumstance God is with us.'
[time=2601] You cannot find a place so high or so deep or so far that God cannot go with you there.
[time=2610] Not a tremendous promise that God is with us in our solitude.
[time=2616] But now let me speak to those of you who over this past year have experienced grief.
[time=2622] As our church grows, as our families multiply, and we have more and more people joining with us in our fellowship here, it seems that every year we experience the emotion of sorrow more
[time=2635] than the year before.
[time=2637] That is also true because as a congregation we are growing older.
[time=2642] This has not been a year without some tragedy.
[time=2645] It has not been a year without some sorrow.
[time=2647] It has not been a year without some unexpected happenings in the lives of our people.
[time=2653] I don't know that there is any truth that is one to which we must turn more than the
[time=2659] truth that is here found, that God is with us in our sorrow.
[time=2665] In 2 Corinthians 1 and verse 4 we read that He is the one who comforts us in all our tribulation.
[time=2674] Listen to it.
[time=2675] In every tribulation God comforts us.
[time=2678] 2 Corinthians 7 and verse 6 says this, "God who comforts those that are cast down."
[time=2685] I've always thought it was interesting that when the Holy Spirit was announced by the Lord Jesus, what did He say?
[time=2691] I will send unto you what, another comforter like unto the one you had before.
[time=2698] Jesus, the Lord, is the comforter.
[time=2700] He is the one who comes in the moment of sorrow to be with us.
[time=2704] I think that there are some folks here in this auditorium today who could say, as they couldn't say last year, I have learned that in the moment of sorrow in the deepest times
[time=2714] of difficulty, when the heart aches until it would break, God is with us.
[time=2720] That is why in the presence of sorrow and difficulty and death and tragedy, the Christian has about Him something that cannot be described.
[time=2728] It is the peace that passeth all understanding.
[time=2731] It is the knowledge that God is with Him.
[time=2733] When He walks through the valley, God is there.
[time=2736] When He goes through the fire of tribulation, God is there.
[time=2739] That is the blessed, continuing, reoccurring eternal truth of Emmanuel.
[time=2746] God with us.
[time=2748] He is not up there.
[time=2749] He is here.
[time=2750] He does not live out of the resources of our imagination, but He is present with us, living
[time=2756] within us.
[time=2757] And when sorrow comes, we can be sure that He will go with us through the difficulty,
[time=2763] for He is the Emmanuel of sorrow.
[time=2766] You don't always see that when you look at the manger.
[time=2769] Oh, but it's a blessed truth, Emmanuel, God with us, when we weep.
[time=2777] I want to share with you also that He is the God who is with us in suffering.
[time=2782] I have quoted just briefly from the book of Isaiah, chapter 43.
[time=2787] If you don't know these verses, you may not have needed to know them, but somewhere along the way you will.
[time=2793] And I would encourage you to at least write them down and store them in the back of your mind for there will come a circumstance in your life when you will be caused to turn to those verses and to read them and perhaps even to memorize them.
[time=2804] This is what the prophet wrote.
[time=2806] Isaiah, chapter 43, verses 2 and 3, "When thou passest through the waters," here it is,
[time=2814] I will be with thee, "and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee.
[time=2819] When thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Let me read that in light of our truth, listen carefully, "When thou passest through the waters Emmanuel, and when thou walkest through the rivers, Emmanuel, and when thou goest through
[time=2839] the fire, Emmanuel, and when the flame is kindled upon thee, Emmanuel."
[time=2846] What does that mean?
[time=2848] God is with you.
[time=2849] He is present with you.
[time=2850] He will not let you experience that suffering alone, flat on your back perhaps right now, looking up at the ceiling of a hospital room.
[time=2858] You may feel like you are totally alone, but if you know Jesus Christ as your Savior and you have accepted Him as your Lord, He is with you.
[time=2866] He is with you right there in that experience for He is promised not ever to leave you in any experience.
[time=2871] God is the Emmanuel of suffering.
[time=2876] There's never a time when we need Him more, and so there's never a time when we sense His presence more.
[time=2883] You may be suffering the kind of agony that perhaps goes beyond the pain of the physical.
[time=2889] You may be suffering some internal hurt, some internal anxiety, which would literally tear
[time=2895] your emotions apart, but the Bible says God is with you in that suffering.
[time=2899] He is the Emmanuel of the sufferer.
[time=2905] But let me encourage you.
[time=2908] Maybe you haven't experienced any of these things.
[time=2910] Maybe you haven't had any sorrow.
[time=2912] You may be one of those young people or middle age people or old people who have never really experienced any suffering in your life at all.
[time=2919] You say, "Well, is God just the God for those who are hurting?" Oh no.
[time=2925] God is the God who has promised to be with us in our service as we serve Him.
[time=2930] I have been so interested in tracing the lives of the people in the Bible.
[time=2934] Those of you who are part of this church know that my favorite portions of Scripture are the narratives, the biographies of God's people recorded in the Scriptures.
[time=2945] Have you ever looked through the Bible and noticed how many times God has promised to
[time=2951] be with those who serve Him?
[time=2955] Have you ever noticed that?
[time=2957] You know, I can scarcely find a ready candidate for service in all of the Bible.
[time=2961] And once in a while I hear people talk about volunteering for the Lord's work.
[time=2965] You know, there aren't many volunteers in the Bible.
[time=2967] The one I ever find who serves God was running away from about as fast as they could.
[time=2971] Do you know that?
[time=2973] God didn't have ready volunteers while we've been studying the life of Moses.
[time=2977] He had 900 excuses why He couldn't serve.
[time=2980] And Joshua didn't want any part of it either.
[time=2983] Listen, how did God enlist Him?
[time=2987] He enlisted them with Emmanuel.
[time=2989] That's what He did.
[time=2991] He said, "I'll be with you." Listen, I'm not asking you to do it alone, Emmanuel is here.
[time=2998] Listen to His words in the book of Exodus chapter 4 verse 12.
[time=3001] We're studying that in our evening services.
[time=3004] He said, "Moses, I'll be with you." Listen to the words in Joshua chapter 1 verse 9, "The Lord thy God shall be with thee."
[time=3015] Listen to the words of Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 8, "I am with thee and then includes yourself in the wonderful promise of Matthew chapter 28 verses 18 and 20.
[time=3025] Go into all the world and preach the gospel, and lo, I am with you always."
[time=3033] To Moses, he was the Emmanuel.
[time=3039] To Jeremiah, the prophet, he was the Emmanuel, and to the apostles, and to the leaders of
[time=3045] the early church he was the Emmanuel, and to all of us who bear the good news of the gospel, he is the Emmanuel.
[time=3052] He has promised to go with us.
[time=3054] So when I step out by faith to do what God has called me to do, men and women, I don't go alone.
[time=3060] When I teach that Sunday school class, or I'm involved in the place of leadership in my local church, or I have an opportunity to go out and witness to my friend, or I work in the business world and bear a testimony with my lifestyle and with my witness verbally, I'm not alone.
[time=3075] For Emmanuel is there, he has drawn alongside of me to be with me.
[time=3080] He is God with me.
[time=3083] He is the Emmanuel of service.
[time=3088] But I want to stop for just a moment now and tell you that all that I have explained to you up to this point is only good for some people.
[time=3101] That's true.
[time=3102] That's not good news in many respects.
[time=3105] Some of you here today, you've listened to all of this and it doesn't apply to you.
[time=3110] Some of you watching and listening by television, you've heard all of this good news, but I have to tell you now, it may not work for you.
[time=3117] It may not be your truth.
[time=3120] For you see, before God can be the Emmanuel in sorrow and suffering and in all of these other things I've shared, first of all, he has to be the Emmanuel in salvation as he come to live in your life.
[time=3133] Have you ever said, "Lord, I accept the truth of Emmanuel and I receive Jesus Christ into my life, come to be with me, come to live within my life, come to indwell me as my Savior."
[time=3145] I confess that I'm a sinner.
[time=3147] I realize that I cannot do it by myself.
[time=3149] "Lord, I've been trying to walk solo all these years and it's not going to work, so I ask you to come into my life and be my Savior if there's never been a point in time in your life when you've accepted the Savior and then received him into your life as your personal Savior, then all of these promises aren't any good because first of all he has to come to be in you before he can come to be with you.
[time=3172] There must be the Emmanuel of salvation.
[time=3177] Jesus Christ said that he came into the world to seek and to save those who were lost, that
[time=3183] salvation belongs to the Lord, he is Emmanuel for those who will put their trust in him.
[time=3192] Over these past days I have been studying the genealogy of Matthew chapter 1.
[time=3199] Sometime in the future I want to preach a message on the subject, the gospel of the genealogy,
[time=3207] the gospel of the genealogy.
[time=3208] We look over this passage and we sort of throw it away mentally.
[time=3211] We don't want to deal with it because it's got all of those begotten's in it and it's not very interesting.
[time=3216] I want to share with you just one little nugget by way of conclusion this morning.
[time=3221] One of the strange things of the genealogy of Matthew chapter 1 is this, that in the
[time=3227] genealogy, that is in the record of the line of our Savior, the record of his coming to
[time=3233] this earth and the record of the ancestry that is so important to the Kingly presentation
[time=3239] of Matthew, there's a strange thing, there are four women listed in the genealogy.
[time=3245] Now that is strange because you don't normally find women in genealogies, but stranger than
[time=3252] the fact of their presence is the fact of their identification.
[time=3255] Let me tell you who they were and you can look it up for yourself when you get a chance.
[time=3261] First of all mentioned in chapter 1 verse 3 is the woman Tamar.
[time=3266] Secondly is the woman Rahab.
[time=3270] Thirdly is the woman Ruth and fourthly is the woman Bathsheba.
[time=3279] What a strange lot to be found in the genealogy of the Savior.
[time=3283] Tamar who's claimed to fame in this record is that she was a harlot and she played the
[time=3290] part of a harlot.
[time=3292] Rahab who finds her place in Hebrews 11 because she lied and she is referred to in the Scripture as Rahab the harlot.
[time=3300] Bathsheba whose notoriety was that she committed adultery with David and had her own husband
[time=3306] murdered in alliance with the King and Ruth, the Moabitis, a Gentile, a Gentile in the line
[time=3316] of the King.
[time=3318] All of these looked upon by the Jewish mind as the off scouring of the world as if the Lord wanted to settle down in the genealogy of his own life, this one truth that Jesus Christ came into the world to save who sinners, not good people, harlots, people who've sinned
[time=3337] against the Lord, people who've committed terrible tragedies, people who in their own lives know their sickness and their violence, Christ came as Emmanuel in salvation to bring
[time=3349] men and women lost in sin the glorious gospel that there can be freedom in the Lord, Emmanuel
[time=3359] in salvation.
[time=3362] It is a wonderful truth.
