[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=13] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerremont.
[time=23] [MUSIC]
[time=53] And the last.
[time=66] [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=133] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=139] >> Every once in a while, I run into someone who says to me, "I don't believe that it's necessary to go to church to be a good Christian.
[time=148] I think a person can worship God almost any place and going to church ought not to be a necessity to be a good Christian." I've never known quite how ought to answer that question.
[time=161] Usually, I answer it something like this.
[time=163] No, it is not necessary to go to church to be a good Christian, but if you are a good Christian, you will go to church.
[time=171] I'm convinced that the Bible teaches very emphatically the importance of the local New Testament church and the importance of gathering together in the name of the Lord and that church attendance, though it is waning in almost every front, according to the Scripture because of the day in which we live ought to be growing.
[time=191] Today, we're going to open the Scripture and look at the key passage in all of the Bible that speaks about the importance of our gathering together as believers.
[time=201] We're going to discuss the subject, why you should go to church.
[time=206] I have to admit, when I got up this morning and looked out the window and saw the snow that was on the ground, I was a bit excited about the special nature of this message for all of those who stayed home today to watch the service on television.
[time=223] Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[time=228] First of all, some music that I know will be a blessing to your heart.
[time=232] Listen now as Pastor Kruger leads our choir and lifting their voices and prays unto the Lord.
[time=262] [MUSIC - 103 seconds]
[time=379] This morning from the Old Testament, I would like to read for you, Malachi chapter 3 verses 16 through 18, which speak of the faith of God
[time=389] about which the choir has just sung for us this morning.
[time=393] Malachi 3, 16 through 18, then they that feared the Lord
[time=399] spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it,
[time=405] and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord
[time=411] and the thought upon his name.
[time=414] And they shall be mine, sayeth the Lord of Host, in the day when I make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son that serves him.
[time=426] Then shall you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God, and that him that serves another.
[time=437] I have read for you this morning Malachi chapter 3 verses 16, 17, and 18.
[time=447] Even though it is a wonderful thing for us to meet together for corporate worship, to share together times of family fellowship around the things of God,
[time=458] we understand all of us that salvation and our relationship with God in heaven is an extremely personal thing.
[time=465] It is a matter of our own personal relationship with him.
[time=469] He came into this world to save sinners, and he has always saved them one at a time.
[time=476] I'm so grateful that I'm a part of his plan of redemption, and I trust as you listen to the minister of music from our own Ron Hackett, you will be reminded that salvation is personal.
[time=486] For those of you who are Christians, you will rejoice in it.
[time=489] For those of you who are yet to receive personal salvation, it will cause you to want to know him because he died for you.
[time=501] It was for you the Savior died, for you his precious blood,
[time=517] for from his side it was for you the Savior died,
[time=533] his strong and loving arms are open wide.
[time=545] He paid the price to thousand years ago,
[time=554] and love he promised says to wash away the soul.
[time=565] It was for you the Savior died,
[time=576] it was for you my friend,
[time=589] it was for you he gave his all,
[time=603] in the world he was called,
[time=609] in the heaven's call,
[time=615] in the soul.
[time=619] He gave his all,
[time=625] for all you hear at the beginning, he was running wild.
[time=636] He was his own, a perfect hiding place.
[time=645] He only heard his all, to accept this gift of grace.
[time=659] It was for you,
[time=665] he gave his all, in the world he raised.
[time=678] He gave his all,
[time=700] he gave his all, he gave his all,
[time=714] this is that special time in the middle of our service when we receive the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and take the opportunity to step aside from the regular format of the service and sit down to talk with our friends at home.
[time=729] This part of our telecast is not shared by those who are part and my wife Don and I just talk with our many friends who watch this telecasted service in their own homes.
[time=740] Don, these days we have been sharing with our friends at home a very special study tool that relates to the four gospels.
[time=748] I've been quite overwhelmed at the response from our friends.
[time=752] We've had many hundreds of requests, especially during the Christmas season, and it doesn't seem like the requests are waning, and it's exciting to think of having this book placed in so many homes.
[time=762] I think a number of people are determined to make a study of the life of Christ in this new year, and this is a real helpful tool if you're going to do that.
[time=771] What it is, it's the four gospels arranged as a single narrative so you can open it up, say if you wanted to study about a particular miracle of Christ and all of the references to that particular miracle right there together.
[time=785] It's such a tremendous time-saving tool because it makes it possible for you to read consecutively through the life of Christ.
[time=793] Some years ago I preached a series of messages on the early life of Christ, and I remember searching through the gospels, finding all of the various pieces of information that belonged, and this just puts all the scriptures in order, so you can start at his birth and read all the way through to his post-resurrection appearances.
[time=811] There's also a handy index at the back so that if you're looking for a particular parable in the life of Christ or a miracle, you just turn to the index in the back and look under that miracle and it tells you what page to turn to so you don't have to search for it.
[time=825] Well, I'm certain that those who've already received their copies are having a good time studying the narratives of the gospels, and we want to make this very special book available to all of you who are watching the Bible Hour today, and we do this as simply as we know how, without any obligation to you, by asking you to call a very special number.
[time=845] It is a toll-free number, which you may call from any place in the United States, does not cost you anything, and by using this number, you can get in touch with our Bible Hour operator, and she will take down your name and address and will mail to you this week your free copy of the four gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=864] Now, down to that phone number he is.
[time=866] The number to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=872] It is a toll-free number, there's no charge to you, and you may call it at any time of the day or night, and if you can't get through today, which is usually the heaviest calling time, try us tomorrow because the operators are there all week long.
[time=884] That number again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=890] Donna, we've been receiving some very special letters from our friends at home.
[time=895] This past week, we got a letter from a young boy who wrote and said that he only made a few dollars a month on a paper route, but he really appreciated the Bible Hour, and he wanted to know if he could be a part of the Founders Club, and he wanted to give $6 a month to the television ministry.
[time=911] I was so blessed by that letter and reminded of the many people who watch this ministry, who do want to have a part.
[time=918] During these new days, in the new years, we began the television ministry in 1979.
[time=924] It is so important that we hear from many of you.
[time=927] If you want the free literature, you may call the toll-free number, but I'm going to ask that many of you take the opportunity today to sit down and write a letter to me, and do what you can to help in the support of this ministry.
[time=940] Most of all, let us know that you're praying for us, and be an encouragement to those who are part of the Bible Hour television ministry.
[time=947] We want you to do that this week.
[time=949] If you will, sit down and write a letter right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=957] If you choose to write, you can request your book in the letter, and then share with us the thoughts in your heart.
[time=962] Perhaps you have a prayer request or a question that we can help you with.
[time=966] Most of all, we just like to know you're there.
[time=968] Television can be a very lonely ministry because sometimes you wonder if the people to whom you minister are really at the other end of the communication cycle.
[time=977] That's true, and that's why your letters are so vital to us.
[time=980] They're a real encouragement to our hearts to continue this ministry to you.
[time=985] Donna, once again, let me remind our friends that the address to which they should write is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=997] And then, of course, you can also call our toll-free number.
[time=1001] That number, again, is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1007] Just ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her you would like the book on the Four Gospels, and we will get it into the mail to you within a few days.
[time=1015] In just a few moments, I'm going to be opening the Word of God and sharing from the Book of Hebrews
[time=1021] a very special message on the subject, "Why You Should Go to Church." Now, I recognize that many of you are going to be watching that in your home, and some of you are not able to go to church.
[time=1032] This message is meant for those who are able, and I trust that you will have your Bibles ready so that as we turn to the Scriptures, you'll be ready to follow along as we discuss together this very important subject, what the Bible says about going to church.
[time=1047] And I trust that you'll be with us now in these next moments as we share some continued music and fellowship together around the Word of God.
[time=1062] The His name is our end is our, our human-based, and our creation of this.
[time=1074] Our middle-based and our Black-dirted embrace.
[time=1083] They'll build an honor to keep all our strength within you.
[time=1092] We trust for our needs to help.
[time=1097] I will seize our hand and power to the end.
[time=1103] Our waggle, the end, the waggle, and the waggle.
[time=1115] So now the Black Hawk singers ask the question, "Is the Lord your shepherd, or do you believe?"
[time=1133] Do you believe in a Father of mercy?
[time=1145] Do you believe in a Savior of love?
[time=1153] Or is there nothing but darkness around you?
[time=1161] Nothing to tell you of heaven above.
[time=1169] Do you believe in my Jesus?
[time=1185] Or is it just too hard to imagine that He could be who He stands in His Word?
[time=1205] Do you believe that He gave you the broken?
[time=1213] Do you believe He gave sight to the blind?
[time=1221] Do you believe that He died to forgive you?
[time=1229] Or is salvation too hard to find?
[time=1237] Do you believe in my Jesus?
[time=1245] Do you believe in my Lord?
[time=1253] Or is it just too hard to imagine that He could be who He stands in His Word?
[time=1273] Or is it just too hard to find?
[time=1293] You can have peace in your mind and your spirit.
[time=1301] You can know fullness of joy in your heart.
[time=1309] You can believe if you trust in the Savior.
[time=1317] Yesterday's gone, today you should start.
[time=1325] Do you believe in my Jesus?
[time=1333] Do you believe in my Lord?
[time=1341] Do you believe that He died to forgive you?
[time=1349] You can believe what He says in His Word.
[time=1363] Last week, as we gathered around the Word, we talked about the presence of Christ in our lives as we walk through this year.
[time=1385] Just before the message this morning, Benetta Eastis is going to come and share with us a song that implores the Lord Jesus to be beside us in every aspect of life.
[time=1395] And I think if you listen to the words of this song, you will hear various aspects of life extolled and how the Lord stays with us in every one of these experiences.
[time=1406] The title of the song is Christ be beside me.
[time=1423] Christ be beside me, Christ be behind me, Christ be behind me, King of my heart.
[time=1440] Christ be behind me, Christ be behind me, Christ be above me, Christ be above me, never too bad.
[time=1457] [MUSIC]
[time=1487] The light of my love.
[time=1492] [MUSIC]
[time=1497] Christ be in all hearts, speaking about thee.
[time=1506] Christ be an altar, telling our being.
[time=1515] Christ be the bishop, He lies that same.
[time=1524] He is that thee, Christ ever be.
[time=1535] Christ be thee, Christ be thee, Christ be thee, King of my love.
[time=1551] Christ be with thee, Christ be with thee, Christ be with thee, ever be.
[time=1568] [MUSIC]
[time=1578] Christ be thee,
[time=1582] [MUSIC]
[time=1592] Thank you, Veneta.
[time=1593] Now will you join me as we open our Bibles to the tenth chapter of the Book of Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 10,
[time=1600] and I want to read verses 19 through verse 25, verse 19 through 25.
[time=1609] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he had consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say his flesh, and having an high priest over the house of God.
[time=1631] Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=1641] Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.
[time=1647] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is,
[time=1657] but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching, shall we pray together.
[time=1667] Our Father in Heaven, we pray that as we take this section of Scripture from the midst of this great book of Hebrews, you will help us to understand the argument and the format into which this section has been written,
[time=1686] that we might get the full impact of its truth to our hearts today, that we might understand every aspect of it as it applies to our own lives, to our own natures.
[time=1696] That each one who listens to this message will be brought to a place of conviction about the importance of the local New Testament church in their own lives.
[time=1705] That men and women who have been wavering in their commitment will be strengthened and solidified, that there will be a time of encouragement as we see all that can happen as our hearts are properly prepared to relate to one another in that which we know as the fellowship of the Body of Christ.
[time=1724] We pray to that end in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1731] All over the United States, in recent days we have been hearing the reports of waning church attendance.
[time=1740] Up until just this past year, the one redeeming feature among evangelicals for church attendance was a large body of Baptist from the southern part of the United States who claimed to have continued growth even though other churches were losing members and attendance.
[time=1762] Two weeks ago, in a nationally released news story, we read in our papers that this body of Baptist churches is suffering from a lesser number of baptisms during this past year than they had the year before and they are crying out for the answer.
[time=1782] As I have opportunity to talk with pastors of other churches, I have not had one pastor that I know of in a large, aggressive, growing church tell me during this past year that it has been a year of great growth.
[time=1795] In fact, I do not know of any of the large, aggressive churches that just a decade or so ago were being written up as the 10 fastest growing churches in the country that are still growing at that level.
[time=1807] The Black Hawk Baptist Church in that respect has been unusual for its growth has remained consistent and constant.
[time=1814] But everywhere we go, we hear of people talking about why the churches aren't growing, why people seem to be staying away from churches by the droves.
[time=1824] You may have heard the story of some women who were discussing the deplorable attendance in their church.
[time=1829] One lady said, "Our congregation is sometimes down to 30 or 40 on Sunday night."
[time=1835] Another one of the ladies said, "That's nothing if you went to our church on Sunday night, sometimes they're not more than six or seven there."
[time=1841] An unmarried lady added her bit.
[time=1844] She said, "It's so bad in our church on Sunday night that when the minister says, "Dearly beloved, it makes me blush."
[time=1854] Churches are suffering from lack of attendance.
[time=1858] People are not going to church as they once did.
[time=1861] To me, that is exactly in reverse proportion to that which the Word of God teaches.
[time=1867] For the Scripture says, "As we see the day of Christ approaching, we are to intensify our attendance with fellow believers at the things of God."
[time=1876] This passage, which I have read for you from the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews, is a part of the entire argument of the writer of Hebrews concerning the relationship that we have as Christians as opposed to the Old Testament economy.
[time=1890] The book of Hebrews was written to a group of Hebrew Christians.
[time=1894] The purpose of the book was to confirm these Jewish Christians in their newfound faith.
[time=1900] Some of them were wavering.
[time=1902] Going back to the Old Testament rituals, some of them were not holding fast the confession of their faith, but were caused to waver by the Judaizers who would come and drag them back into the ritualism that they once knew.
[time=1916] The book is presented in such a way that it shows that in the person of Jesus Christ, and in all that we have because of Him, we have a much better situation than did those in the Old Testament.
[time=1928] In fact, the key word in the book of Hebrews is the word better.
[time=1932] Throughout the book, Jesus Christ is presented as one who is superior to the angels, one who is superior to Moses, one who is superior to Joshua, one who is superior to Aaron.
[time=1943] And because of his superiority, because he was the son of God who came in the flesh, he has opened up, even according to our text, a new and living and better way of fellowship with God.
[time=1955] Whereas in the Old Testament, the Jew could not enter into the presence of God at any time in the tabernacle, and the high priest could not enter the holy of holies at will, but only at special times during the Jewish year.
[time=1968] Now, because Jesus Christ has tore open the veil of the holy of holies and is rented into, he offers to us instant access into the presence of an Almighty God, which we may take advantage of at any time.
[time=1981] He has become through his flesh, through his incarnation and death, the one who has unlocked the door into the presence of God.
[time=1989] He is a new and living and better way that we have as Christians.
[time=1994] The privilege that we have as New Testament Christians is a privilege, unthought of, unheard of, unrealized by those who lived before the cross.
[time=2005] Now, the writer of Hebrews is making all of these privileges very known to his readers.
[time=2010] He is reminding them of the great privileges that are theirs, but he is doing what is so often done in the polemical literature of the New Testament.
[time=2018] But he is saying to them, "Because of the privileges you have, you also have some responsibilities."
[time=2025] That is a word that needs to be spoken in this day.
[time=2028] We are so intent on the privileges we have.
[time=2031] We like to list them and label them and to rehearse them often.
[time=2036] We forget that with privilege comes responsibility, and so it is in the New Testament.
[time=2041] In the text, the writer presents two privileges that we have, and then he rehearses three responsibilities that are ours because of those two privileges.
[time=2054] If you are interested in the way the text is constructed, you can denote the construction of this passage of Scripture by noting several key words.
[time=2064] First of all, you will notice that the two privileges that we have are signaled in the text by the little word "having."
[time=2071] Read it this way.
[time=2072] Verse 19, "Having boldness to enter into the holy place." Verse 21, "And having an high priest over the house of God." Those are the two privileges.
[time=2083] Then the three responsibilities that we are given are signaled to us in the text by the little word "let us" and "exortative" in the text.
[time=2092] The words are "let us draw near." Verse 22, "Let us hold fast." Verse 23, "And let us consider." Verse 24, "Two privileges and three responsibilities." Now let's look at them carefully.
[time=2107] What are the privileges that we have as Christians in this day and age?
[time=2112] The Scripture, first of all, says we have the privilege of access.
[time=2116] The Scripture says, "Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus."
[time=2124] Imagine yourself as an Old Testament Hebrew Christian reading this word from the apostle.
[time=2131] Imagine how this would come into your consciousness having been brought up and steeped in the sanctity of the holy place of the tabernacle,
[time=2139] a place that no average Israelite could ever enter and the high priest only at certain times.
[time=2144] Imagine the impact of the words of the writer of Hebrews as you read the epistle and it comes to your consciousness that now, through the person of Jesus Christ, you not only have access but you have boldness to enter into the presence of God.
[time=2159] The word boldness here in the text is a word which is translated best by the phrase boldness to speak.
[time=2166] It means that you can go into the presence of God as a Christian at any time and boldly speak before him.
[time=2173] You are a part of the kingdom of believer-priest in this generation.
[time=2177] There is no mediator through whom you must go.
[time=2180] I care not what any religious sect may say.
[time=2182] There is nothing that stands between you and God, no church, no individual, no person.
[time=2187] If you're born again, you may enter into the presence of God through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2193] Men and women, do you understand that to be a privilege?
[time=2196] Had you grown up knowing something of Judaism and all of the trappings of that religion
[time=2202] and all of the terrible austerity of their commitment,
[time=2208] you would understand something of the privilege that is yours to enter into the presence with boldness of an almighty God.
[time=2215] The first privilege is the privilege of access and will you note in your text that it is an access you may entertain with boldness.
[time=2223] At any moment, at any time, if you're in the spirit of God, if you're walking in fellowship and your heart is clean,
[time=2229] you can walk into the presence of God.
[time=2232] But notice the second privilege.
[time=2234] The first having is the having of boldness and access.
[time=2238] The second thing we have as Christians, verse 21, is that we have a high priest over the house of God.
[time=2245] I need not get God on my side when I enter into his presence.
[time=2250] The Scripture says he is already on my side.
[time=2253] He is my high priest.
[time=2255] He is over the house of God.
[time=2257] And he never is outside of his priestly ministry.
[time=2260] He stands at the right hand of God, making intercession for those who believe.
[time=2264] And as I enter into the presence of God, the high priest is always there.
[time=2268] And he officiates over my life of worship and fellowship with an almighty God.
[time=2274] I may enter boldly, and when I do, I find him waiting, waiting there to receive that which I bring.
[time=2282] That is why the poet has written, "near so very near to God, nearer I cannot be, for in the person of his Son I am just as near as he.
[time=2293] Dear so very dear to God, dear I cannot be, for in the person of his Son I am just as dear as he.
[time=2303] In the person of the Lord Jesus Christ I am before God in the same position as the Son of God is to his Father.
[time=2312] I stand before him, accepted in the beloved, and the high priest officiates into that place where I enter by way of access."
[time=2320] And those are my privileges.
[time=2323] Those are wonderful privileges.
[time=2325] I am confident that apart from an Old Testament sense, we cannot appreciate the privilege that is ours.
[time=2331] If we appreciated it, we would not take it so for granted as we do.
[time=2336] Those are our privileges.
[time=2339] Will you notice, however, that the writer of Hebrews is very careful to let us know that they are privileges that carry with them responsibilities?
[time=2349] Responsibilities that we must accept if we're going to be Christians who are living according to the Word of God.
[time=2356] Here are the responsibilities. They are listed for us in the text.
[time=2360] First responsibility, let us draw near in fullness of faith.
[time=2364] Secondly, we are to hold fast the confession of our hope.
[time=2369] Thirdly, we are to consider one another to provoke unto love.
[time=2373] Will you notice that in the text these are not single acts, but they are acts that are repeated.
[time=2379] There is within the text the concept of continuity. Let us continually draw near.
[time=2385] Let us continually hold fast. Let us continually consider one another.
[time=2391] Let it be a repetitive process over and over again.
[time=2395] Let us do these things as a part of our Christian commitment.
[time=2398] The first of these responsibilities is that we are to draw near in the fullness of faith.
[time=2405] Someone has written that privilege becomes powerful when it is practiced.
[time=2413] You know, we have a lot of privileges that are not very powerful in our lives because we don't practice them.
[time=2418] The Bible says that it is our privilege to go into the access in the presence of God with boldness,
[time=2424] and then the exhortation is men and women, let us draw near.
[time=2428] Let us come into the presence of God.
[time=2431] It is as if having had these privileges laid upon us, we don't understand the nature of them,
[time=2437] and so we neglect them.
[time=2438] And the apostle is saying to us, here is the privilege, now take advantage of it.
[time=2443] The word "draw near" is the New Testament word prosuchomai, which means to worship, to draw near in intimacy, to come into the presence of God with the purpose of worshiping him,
[time=2454] bowing down before him boldness, yes, but worship also, that we might adore him, that we might know him.
[time=2460] And notice the Scripture says we may do this with a true heart and with full assurance of faith.
[time=2466] We may come boldly because we know that we have been cleansed and we stand righteous before him.
[time=2473] In the last part of this first section concerning this exhortation, to draw near unto God, there are some words that speak of cleansing, cleansing of the inside through sprinkling and of the outside through the washing of the body.
[time=2486] Some commentators have tried to see here the ritual of baptism.
[time=2489] It has nothing whatsoever to do with that.
[time=2491] This passage is talking about the Old Testament ritual cleansing, which symbolize the clean life
[time=2498] that is brought to God through faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2501] Mark it down, we can draw near to God, not because we are clean in ourselves, or we have anything to offer him,
[time=2508] but we draw near unto God because we have been cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2514] and we stand ceremonially clean before God, and he accepts us because of that.
[time=2521] Therefore, we are to draw near unto him.
[time=2524] That is a ritual term, this drawing near, which refers to worship.
[time=2531] And it is a call to us to avoid any kind of lukewarm or indifferent drawing near unto God.
[time=2539] Now to be sure this first injunction need not be confined to drawing near to God when we come to church.
[time=2546] It is an opportunity that we have at any time in any situation.
[time=2550] In fact, it is almost contrasted to public meetings.
[time=2553] It is saying to us, as in the Old Testament they drew near at certain times, now as Christians you may draw near at any time you may draw near to God at any time in your life.
[time=2564] It is both a personal and corporate responsibility.
[time=2569] But will you notice now the second exhortation, the second responsibility?
[time=2574] Let us hold fast the confession, and the word translated in the King James Version is the word faith.
[time=2582] If you saw that in the language of the New Testament it is the word elpid das, which is a word translated by the word hope.
[time=2589] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope.
[time=2593] Now don't be bothered by the interchanging of those words, for the New Testament says that faith is the substance of things hoped for and sometimes the words are used interchangeably.
[time=2604] But here the actual word is the word hope.
[time=2607] And it says that we are to hold fast the confession of our hope.
[time=2612] These Jewish people, to whom the writer of Hebrews had written, were wavering in their commitment.
[time=2619] They had confessed Christ as personal Savior, but when all of the impact of their old friends
[time=2625] came upon them and all of the beauty of the ritualism of the Old Testament practice was paraded before them.
[time=2631] Sometimes they were encouraged to fall back from their profession and go back to living the old way.
[time=2637] And the writer comes to them with this strong exhortation and he says that confession of faith which you have made before God you are to hold it fast.
[time=2646] The word hold is a word which is a military term.
[time=2649] It means to fend off all those who would come to take it from you.
[time=2652] You stand strong in your confession of faith.
[time=2655] You hold that confession of faith before all enemies.
[time=2659] We are reminded in the New Testament in Luke chapter 12 verse 8 that everyone who shall confess the Lord before men, him he will confess before his angels.
[time=2670] We are told in Romans chapter 10 verses 9 and 10 that if we confess with our mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in our hearts that God hath raised him from the dead we shall be saved.
[time=2681] Over and over again we are told that when we are Christians we are to confess our faith.
[time=2687] We are to profess it publicly. We are to acknowledge it.
[time=2691] Turn back in the book of Hebrews and you will understand that this is a concern that the writer had.
[time=2697] He repeated it more than once.
[time=2699] First of all turn back to Hebrews chapter 3 in verse 6.
[time=2703] But Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are
[time=2709] if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
[time=2716] Look at verse 14 in chapter 3.
[time=2719] Seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens.
[time=2723] Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our confession.
[time=2728] Notice chapter 4 and verse 14.
[time=2734] Chapter 4 and verse 14. Let's go back and get 3 verse 14.
[time=2738] For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.
[time=2745] These three exhortations now are culminated in chapter 10 and we are reminded that God expects us to hold fast our confession.
[time=2754] It is a matter of our personal witness one to the other.
[time=2758] What we have professed to believe and what we professed to be we are supposed to be and we are to do it according to the text without wavering.
[time=2766] We are to stand up and say I am a Christian. I believe the word of God.
[time=2770] I have accepted Christ. I confess Christ. I say it. I believe it and I live it.
[time=2776] We are to allow nothing to shake our confidence. Why should we waver?
[time=2780] For He has promised to be with us.
[time=2784] The second exhortation in light of our privilege of access and of the great high priest who serves over us
[time=2790] is that we are to hold fast our confession of faith.
[time=2793] If we have accepted Christ let us not be wavering in our confession.
[time=2797] Now the third is found in the last part of this section of scripture
[time=2803] and it is written according to this measure.
[time=2807] Let us verse 24 consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.
[time=2815] Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the matter of some is
[time=2821] but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching.
[time=2826] Exhortation number one, let us draw near unto God in worship.
[time=2832] Exhortation number two, let us walk steadfastly, consistently, let us witness our confession one to another.
[time=2844] Exhortation number three, let us consider one another to provoke unto good works.
[time=2850] All three of these exhortations can be handled individually but it is not an accident that germane to all three of them is the exhortation to public worship
[time=2860] and to the gathering together of God's people.
[time=2863] This last of the three exhortations says that when we come together to consider one another we are to do three things as the result of it.
[time=2871] First of all we are to provoke one another unto love.
[time=2875] I am certain that there are many Baptist churches which have misread this passage.
[time=2879] When they come together it is to provoke one another and it seems that they do it quite naturally, quite readily and there is abroad the story that if you want to get into a good church fight join a Baptist church. Thank God we don't have that here but we believe in provoking one another all right but provoking one another to love and the word provoke is a word which means to stir up within the inside part of a man
[time=2904] to by your own actions, by your own spirit, by your own demeanor to so stir that person up that they will want to love.
[time=2912] And secondly we are to stir one another up to do good works.
[time=2916] We are to by our very attitudes, by our very actions, by our very presence with one another, to stir one another up to do good works.
[time=2926] And thirdly we are to encourage one another or to exhort one another
[time=2932] and to stand alongside of one another which is what the word means to stand beside one another. Now let me stop for just a moment.
[time=2942] Why should you go to church? Why should you be involved in the assembling of yourselves together?
[time=2950] First of all because by being a part of God's family the blessed body of Christ meeting together in session you are encouraged to draw nigh unto God.
[time=2960] You are encouraged to draw nigh unto His presence, you are brought nigh unto Him through the ministry of the word of God, through the ministry of music, through the fellowship of one another.
[time=2969] Secondly you ought to go to church because the Scripture says we are to hold fast our confession.
[time=2974] We are to continually be witnessing that we belong to Christ.
[time=2978] How do you witness that you belong to Christ?
[time=2980] By being where God's people belong, by being a part of God's family.
[time=2984] Every time you walk out of your neighborhood with your Bible under your arm, get in your car on Sunday morning there are half a dozen people I'm sure who know where you are going and who you are and what you are doing because you witness your confession before God.
[time=2996] But more important than that when you come to this church and you sit in these seats on Sunday morning and people look around and see you, by your presence you are holding fast your confession of faith.
[time=3006] You are saying I believe what I once believed.
[time=3009] I confess that what I said when I accepted Christ is still true in my life.
[time=3014] I hold fast my confession of faith, I'm not ashamed of it.
[time=3017] I have to wonder about people who say they are Christians and then have sent themselves
[time=3023] from the house of God for long periods of time for whatever excuse.
[time=3027] We who are Baptists and believe in immersion get washed out by very little water these days.
[time=3033] Just a little drop of water here and there, a little snow now and then and keeps us all from coming to church.
[time=3038] Why?
[time=3040] We apparently have not caught the principle of the Word of God which says that by our presence in the house of God with God's people
[time=3048] we are witnessing our confession one to another, we are encouraging others to hold fast the profession of their faith.
[time=3055] We are witnessing by our presence to each other that which has come to be true in our own life.
[time=3062] You know the Bible teaches church attendance in such a way that even gives us an example of what happened when one person missed a service.
[time=3070] Do you remember Thomas when the Lord gathered with his apostles?
[time=3075] Wouldn't you have hated to have been Thomas?
[time=3078] He didn't go to an apostles meeting one night and the night he missed the Lord showed up in the presence of him.
[time=3085] Have you ever wondered how much you've missed because you haven't been where you ought to be in God's house?
[time=3090] I think one of the neat things about the Black Hawk Baptist Church is when people go away on vacation or they're out of town for a week, they come back and they hear all kinds of exciting things that have happened while they're gone, they feel bad.
[time=3100] May that continue.
[time=3101] I hope there's so much going on here that every time you miss when you come back you feel terrible.
[time=3106] We're going to work at it. We're going to make that happen.
[time=3111] But I want you to notice that the third thing is not worship or witness, but it is work.
[time=3117] Men and women, the Scripture says when we come together we are to encourage one another and provoke one another to love and to good works.
[time=3125] I don't know how to express to you what it means to all who are part of a local assembly when they see all of God's family gathered together for a service.
[time=3135] It encourages me. I'll tell you that. I don't like to preach to empty pews.
[time=3141] I don't like to come to church and see that people have not come.
[time=3144] If you're watching by television at home and you should have been here, then I hope you're under conviction and you almost want to get in your car and come right now and get to hear to the end of it.
[time=3153] If you use television or radio or anything else is an excuse to absent yourself from the house of God, the Bible says that sin and you ought not to do it.
[time=3166] Certainly we're glad for the media that offers us the opportunity to share with those at home, but that is not a substitute.
[time=3172] How can you provoke someone to love and good works when you're sitting out in a living room someplace and the rest of God's family is gathered in the house of God?
[time=3180] How can you encourage God's people when you're there and God's people are here?
[time=3187] The Bible says we gather together for the purpose of provoking unto love, to provoke unto good works, and to encourage.
[time=3195] There is union in meeting together.
[time=3198] May I summarize what the Scripture says this morning?
[time=3202] We have a great privilege as a Christian, and that privilege carries with it a responsibility.
[time=3208] We are to draw near. That's our Godward relationship.
[time=3212] We are to hold fast our confession. That's our self-word relationship.
[time=3217] We are to consider one another. That's our other word confession of faith.
[time=3222] And will you notice that the three exhortations embody the triad of graces which are so prominent in the New Testament?
[time=3232] We are to draw near in worship with full assurance of faith.
[time=3237] We are to hold fast our confession of hope, and we are to provoke one another unto love.
[time=3245] When God's people meet together, they put into operation faith and hope and love in such a way that it cannot be measured.
[time=3254] That it goes out and reaches out to those who are outside of the church and strengthens those who are inside of the church.
[time=3261] And it's what makes the church what it is.
[time=3264] There is no such thing as the invisible church if it means that the church never meets.
[time=3269] The church is strong when it's together. Years ago, a man by the name of Ignatius, church father wrote,
[time=3276] "When you frequently and in numbers meet together, the powers of Satan are overthrown, and his mischief is neutralized by your life-mindedness and faith.
[time=3286] There is strength in the people of God meeting together." I don't know what excuse you might use for not being faithful on Sunday mornings and Sunday nights and Wednesday nights,
[time=3297] whatever excuse it's not good enough. The Bible says that because the day of the Lord is drawing near,
[time=3303] because Jesus Christ is coming back, we ought to intensify our meeting with one another.
[time=3308] Churches all over the country are canceling prayer meetings.
[time=3310] Many, many churches that once had Sunday night services no longer meet together.
[time=3314] Why? They don't understand the Lord's coming back.
[time=3317] And because He's coming back, we need each other and we need to meet together for instruction and fellowship and encouragement and strengthening.
[time=3323] The Bible teaches that because He's coming soon, we ought to be meeting with one another.
[time=3328] Turn in your Bibles to the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=3334] I'm sorry, 2 Thessalonians. 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[time=3343] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[time=3351] Listen to what this passage says.
[time=3353] "Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him."
[time=3361] I want you to understand that little phrase, "our gathering together."
[time=3367] In the book of Hebrews, it says, "For sake not the assembling of yourselves together."
[time=3373] And the word here is, "our gathering together." You've been sharing the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
