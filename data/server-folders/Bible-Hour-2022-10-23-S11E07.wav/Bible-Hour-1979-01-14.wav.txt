[time=15] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=25] [ Singing ]
[time=55] >> Several weeks ago, I received a letter from a woman
[time=72] who shares our services by television in which she asked this question.
[time=78] She said, "Pastor, I don't understand how it is that when Christ comes into a person's life to make them holy, there still seems to be so much sin among Christians." That certainly struck a responsive note in my heart for I have had many individuals say to me on differing occasions similar things.
[time=101] I have remembered situations where people have said, "I went to work in a Christian organization, and I never found such terrible display of character among people as I did in that place." I've heard people say, "I got into a business involvement with another Christian, and unsaved people never treated me like that Christian did." I work next to a Christian, and I have never seen a person slough off the job as much as he does.
[time=132] How do you explain the apparent low living among so many Christians?
[time=138] Well, obviously, it's impossible to answer that question fully in the measure of one hour.
[time=143] But in a few moments, we're going to open God's word, and I believe he has some answers for us.
[time=148] And I trust with your Bible's open and your heart's open to receive the ministry of the Spirit of God, you'll be prepared to listen.
[time=155] First of all, we've prepared some special music of worship to our Savior, the Lord Jesus.
[time=160] Listen now as our choir sings the prayer of Psalm 139.
[time=164] Search me, O God.
[time=167] [MUSIC]
[time=171] Search me, O God, and know my heart today.
[time=197] Try me, O Savior, and know my thoughts.
[time=202] I pray, see if there be some where there may be.
[time=220] [MUSIC]
[time=250] Search me, O God, O God, O God, O God, O Holy Spirit,
[time=270] revival comes from me.
[time=278] Send the revival.
[time=281] Start the word in me.
[time=289] I will declare the words of my army.
[time=301] For power I only be, for power I only be, for power I only be,
[time=312] for power I only be, for power I only be,
[time=335] be, send on me.
[time=344] The choir has invited us to open our hearts
[time=355] and to be searched and examined by God.
[time=358] And he does that today through his word.
[time=360] And I would invite you to listen as I read for you Galatians, the fifth chapter, verses 16 through 18.
[time=369] This I say then, walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[time=378] For the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh.
[time=384] And these are contrary, one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that you would.
[time=393] But if you be led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
[time=398] I have read for you this morning, Galatians, chapter 5, verses 16, 17, and 18.
[time=405] Thank you, Rick.
[time=410] We are going to share now in the ministry of star Narwhal as she comes to sing a song for us that reminds us that when we are searching for the Lord in our own lives and when we're seeking for him to be a part of us, he has time for us.
[time=427] He's there waiting available if we'll just avail ourselves of his presence, star Narwhal.
[time=446] There's a feeling that laughter has gone out of your life
[time=458] when you stray in your heart from the truth.
[time=469] And because you have given him to the weakness of man,
[time=480] the life of the Lord seems removed.
[time=494] But one kind of friend offers help on a clear day
[time=505] and leaves at the first sign of rain.
[time=517] Not this kind of friend, he is something far greater.
[time=527] You can't turn to him again and again.
[time=537] He's got all the time in the world.
[time=547] And he knows what temptation can do.
[time=557] So don't worry that he will give up on you.
[time=570] He's got all the time in the world.
[time=596] And he knows what temptation can do.
[time=605] So don't worry that he will give up on you.
[time=618] He's got all the time, he's got all the time.
[time=632] He's got all the time in the world.
[time=660] Thank you for sharing the Bible Hour with us today, and for letting us take these few moments to share with you at home some information which we know is going to be of help to you in your own personal walk with the Lord.
[time=674] One of the ways that we are committed to extending the ministry of the Bible Hour into the homes of those who share this ministry with us is through the use of printed literature.
[time=683] Donna, I just looked at the results of last year in the television ministry, and you know, just in books alone, we mailed out over 5,000 books to people who wrote in.
[time=696] We wrote something like 10,000 to 15,000 letters in response to questions.
[time=700] And when we realized the opportunity, God has given us to reach out to people in such a significant way, it really is exciting, isn't it?
[time=708] Yes, it really is to read the responses that we get in the mail from people who have been helped in their Bible study and in their growing process as a Christian through the materials that we've been able to send them.
[time=719] And those numbers that I gave just a few moments ago do not even include the regular Book of the Month studies that we send out to our Founders Club members, our regular ongoing ministry of Bible study which so many people have appreciated.
[time=732] During these days, we've been really overwhelmed by the response that we have received through the mail and the telephone lines to a book that we have been offering on the Four Gospels.
[time=745] I was interested in an occurrence that happened at home this week that I think you ought to share with our friends.
[time=752] Most of our mail comes here to the church, but occasionally someone can't come up with that address and they happen to find our address and so they mail it at home.
[time=759] And we received a letter this week from a woman who had been visiting in a home and saw the copy on the Four Gospels that we are offering at this time.
[time=769] And she's involved in a Bible study and she said, "Please rush me a copy right away." She said, "It was so helpful and just glancing through it and I'd like to have it to use it." - And I've met people on the street who've asked me if I couldn't get them a copy of the Four Gospels because they wanted to study with us through the year in the life of Christ.
[time=787] Of course, the book that we're talking about is the Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=792] It is a book which puts together all of the events of the Four Gospels in order chronologically so that you can read from the beginning to the end the life of our Lord Jesus and His teachings.
[time=804] And of course, it helps to avoid some of the confusion that can develop if we don't have a tool like that.
[time=811] Isn't that true?
[time=812] - That's right, it's really helpful.
[time=814] And if you're studying a particular aspect of the life of Christ and miracle that He's performed or something and you can't lay your finger on it, there's an index in the back which has them alphabetically.
[time=825] And so if you have the first letter, you can just turn to the back and find it.
[time=830] And added to that, Don, is the fact that when you do find it, you will not only find Matthew's account of the miracle, but if Mark recorded it, you will find his account listed there too, so you will get all of the information.
[time=842] I remember some time ago preaching on the miracle of Christ as He went across the sea with His disciples and reading it from one of the Gospels and thinking that I had the complete record.
[time=854] And then I looked up the reference in Mark and I found four or five thoughts in Mark that weren't included in Matthew that just really made the passage come alive for me and helped me to understand things that I might not have understood otherwise.
[time=866] Now, I've spent some time getting ready to study the Bible, but you know many people would just miss the blessing.
[time=872] Of course, with the four Gospels, you can't do that.
[time=875] - That's right, and we would like to encourage you to contact us for your free copy of this helpful booklet.
[time=881] And the way you do that is by calling our toll-free number.
[time=885] That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=890] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her you would like the booklet on the four Gospels.
[time=896] That number again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=901] - And I would urge you to call right now, if you can.
[time=906] If you wait 'til the end of the telecast, that will be fine.
[time=908] And if when you call, the lines are busy and you cannot get through, please continue trying until you reach the operator.
[time=915] Obviously, because this program is on at a certain time, most people will call immediately during the hour of the telecast.
[time=922] So if you'll just wait a little while, if the phones are busy and try again, I'm sure that you'll be able to get through.
[time=928] The number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=932] And then let me urge you, if you have time and will take the time to do it, to sit down and write us a letter.
[time=938] It would encourage us to hear from many of you this week, especially those of you who are watching in Chicago, Indianapolis, and South Bend.
[time=945] It means so much to us to know that the television program as it reaches out to these other areas is meeting a need in your life.
[time=952] If you can sit down today and write us, we would appreciate it.
[time=955] And when you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=963] If you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television, it is appreciated.
[time=968] We certainly do covet your prayers for this ministry during this particular time.
[time=972] We thank God for the privilege of extending the ministry to you, and we trust that He will lay upon your heart a burden to be faithful in your support, both through your prayers and through your regular giving.
[time=984] Now Donna, before we go back to the service, why don't you give them that number again that they can call?
[time=988] - That toll-free number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=994] Be sure and ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like the book on the four gospels.
[time=1002] - And let me encourage you to stay with us now for some more music, and in just a moment, a message on the subject, why is there so much sin among Christians?
[time=1011] I'm sure that the word of God will have something to say to your heart as you share this telecrass with us.
[time=1017] (upbeat music)
[time=1030] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=1069] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1074] We want you to listen now as our men singers, our men's quartet comes, and they're going to sing for us on the theme of the beautiful word that is the beautiful person, Jesus.
[time=1090] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=1307] - Thank you, Cortette.
[time=1319] I appreciate your ministry and harmony.
[time=1322] We're gonna hear from our minister of music on Kruger now before the message.
[time=1327] While he's coming, let me remind you that some good friends who we met at last year's missionary conference are going to be with us next week.
[time=1335] Himon Al-Parake and his wife are going to be here to minister in music next Sunday.
[time=1344] And you remember they're from the Philippine Islands and they were saved through the ministry of a missionary who went there to serve and God called them into full-time music and they're here back in the States, just a beautiful people with a testimony for the Lord and they'll be sharing in the music ministry next Sunday and I trust that you'll make a special effort to be available to their ministry to your heart.
[time=1366] Now Don, sing for us before the message.
[time=1368] - If you were to make a list of all the blessings you've received since you've trusted Christ as your savior, I'm sure that list would be long.
[time=1380] Let me share some of the things I would have on my list.
[time=1384] [MUSIC - 163 seconds]
[time=1552] - Thank you, Don.
[time=1563] Thank you for your ministry of music to our hearts.
[time=1566] We have worshiped together.
[time=1568] Thank the Lord for the privilege.
[time=1570] I want to ask you to turn in your Bibles to the portion of scripture that Mr. Hawkes read a few moments ago.
[time=1575] And we are going to be spending some time in the book of Galatians and referring back to the book of Romans a little bit later.
[time=1583] But I want your Bibles open now to Galatians chapter five.
[time=1587] And I want to read again just the 17th verse.
[time=1592] Galatians chapter five verse 17.
[time=1599] For the flesh warath against the spirit and the spirit warath against the flesh.
[time=1609] And these are at war the one to the other so that she cannot do the things that she would.
[time=1616] Shall we pray?
[time=1618] Our God in heaven, we come to this passage of scripture.
[time=1625] We have read it.
[time=1629] We acknowledge it to be the truth of God.
[time=1631] But oh, in our honesty, we acknowledge it to be the experience of our lives.
[time=1637] The war, the holy war that goes on within each of us who names the name of Christ.
[time=1643] We recognize that we ought to be men and women
[time=1651] more like Christ than we are.
[time=1655] We look around us at a world which is dying to see the reality of the Christian experience and we're mindful of the fact that the only Christ they will ever see in this world is the Christ they see through us.
[time=1668] We are appalled at the lack of Christ's likeness in each of our lives.
[time=1672] We realize that you have called us to be holy, that you expect us to be holy.
[time=1678] And yet who among us has not felt the sting of defeat in this one area of life, perhaps more than any other?
[time=1686] We search the scriptures for answers.
[time=1691] Lord, it is possible that we search when the answer is right before us.
[time=1699] We seek for some deep, dark secret and it is an open revelation of God.
[time=1706] We would pray that you will help us to search through the scriptures today.
[time=1712] That the spirit of God would impress upon us the importance of these few moments.
[time=1719] That every Christian, man and woman, boy and girl, young person, will give of their attention to the word of God that we might make an impact upon the hearts of men and women today.
[time=1735] For we recognize that as you are holy, you have called us to be holy.
[time=1742] We pray to that end in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1747] I suppose ever since I can remember being a Christian
[time=1754] from my teenage years, I have on occasion conducted conversations with other Christians about the secret of the Christian experience.
[time=1766] I have read books by mystics and kesics.
[time=1772] I have read books by noted Bible teachers.
[time=1775] I have heard tapes and listened to lectures.
[time=1779] I have discussed with great Bible theologues, the doctrine of holy living among Christians.
[time=1788] I suppose like many of you, I have felt that I would keep looking and keep searching and ultimately I would find some secret in my pursuit that would unlock and open up all of the treasures of victorious Christian living.
[time=1803] And if I could just find that one thing that my life would come together and all of the bits and pieces that seemed extraneous to the central purpose of godly living would somehow come together into a beautiful picture.
[time=1816] I have listened to those who claim that this is to be had through some emotional experience.
[time=1821] I have delved into their literature and read the account of what it is that's supposed to happen in our lives when whatever it is happens to us.
[time=1831] I have studied their theology and I have discovered that there is a lot to be desired in their theology.
[time=1838] And yet constantly people come to me with these questions.
[time=1843] Pastor, why is it that there is so much sin among Christians?
[time=1846] Why is it to be more personal that I cannot have more of a godly, consistent walk with the Lord in my own life?
[time=1854] Why is it that as I seek to be like God, I seem to be on an endless journey of frustration and confusion?
[time=1863] I believe that God would have us to understand some things about that question today.
[time=1870] Why is there so much sin among Christians?
[time=1874] Why is it that as we look out at the world today, there seems to be so much of Christianity in the world and so much of the world in Christianity that it's very difficult to tell the difference between the two?
[time=1888] I think there are a number of reasons that get down to the real core reason, three reasons which in reality result in one reason.
[time=1898] And I would like to share with you what I understand from the scriptures in that realm today.
[time=1904] First of all, I believe one of the reasons there is so much sin among Christians and such a low level of living among God's people is the fact that we do not acknowledge the presence of the old sin nature in our lives.
[time=1921] Now it is true that as well-taught Christians, as Bible-believing Christians, we understand that it is a truth of the word of God.
[time=1930] We cannot ignore that.
[time=1932] But I'm not talking now about mental ascent to a system of doctrine.
[time=1936] I'm talking about a heartfelt acknowledgement of the presence of the old sin nature in your life and in mine.
[time=1946] The Bible is very clear about the fact that you and I have been brought into this world and present with us in this world in our lives is a nature which is foreign to God.
[time=1958] David cried out in the 51st Psalm in the 5th verse, "Behold, I was shaping in iniquity and in sin "did my mother conceive me." Ephesians chapter four verse 22 tells us that we are in possession of the old man who is corrupt according to deceitful lusts.
[time=1978] Romans chapter eight and verse eight tells us that when we are in the flesh or when we operate according to the old nature, we cannot please God.
[time=1988] Paul wrote to the Corinthians and in the first letter of Corinthians chapter three verses one and two, he scolded them and chided them and scored them because though they were of an age to be teachers and should have been in a place of leadership they were still babies and he said you're carnal and you walk according to the flesh and you are not godly but you're filled with the fruits of the old nature.
[time=2011] Romans chapter seven verse 18, the Apostle Paul,
[time=2017] one of the great leaders of the Christian faith, perhaps the greatest man to live after Christ confessed that he had come to the appreciation and understanding in his own life that in him, that is in his flesh, in his old nature, not one good thing, good dwell.
[time=2033] Men and women, one of the first steps to the understanding of godly and righteous living is the acknowledgement, both mentally and with our hearts that as creatures of God, we contain, we possess, we partially are the outworking of the old sin nature which was inherited from our father Adam.
[time=2056] And if I understand that to be what the scripture says it is, that means that every one of us here in this room and under the sound of my voice is capable of the most heinous sin that has ever been committed by any.
[time=2068] Our newspapers are filled with all of the tragedy of sin at its full bloom in these past days and we look at it with horror and yet the truth of the word of God is that because we possess the old sin nature, there is not a person, there is not one of us, no matter how good we may think we are or how cultured we may be that is not capable of committing in our old sin nature the most wicked and heinous sin that has ever been committed by any man, that is the fruit of the old nature left to itself unrestrained, the old nature is capable of terrible deeds.
[time=2103] But you say pastor, we're not talking to unsaved people today, we're talking about why is there so much sin among Christians, oh, oh you mean when you get saved, the old nature is not there, such is the teaching of some, such is the teaching of some who tell us when we are born again, the old nature is erased, it is eradicated and we have the new nature of God with no competition and yet I read in the word of God a letter addressed by Paul to Galatian believers that the spirit, the new nature and the flesh, the old nature are at war with one another and one war is against the other, a dominant truth in the pastoral epistles and in the Pauline epistles is the truth that Christians still possess the same potential for wickedness and evil that they possessed before they were saved.
[time=2159] Now to be true, they have the new nature and the divine nature of God which is capable of giving them victory through obedience but it is still true that in our lives as Christians we have the capability of being terrible sinners.
[time=2173] John wrote a letter to his beloved children, the men and women to whom he had spoken the truth who had come to be a part of his spiritual family.
[time=2183] Over and over again, he called them his dear children.
[time=2187] He said they were his special ones but listen to what he said to his Christian family, his family of the faith.
[time=2196] He wrote in 1 John, chapter one verse eight.
[time=2200] If we say that we have no sin as Christians, if we say that we don't have the sin nature as Christians we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us and I believe that the core of much of the defeat and disobedience and sinfulness in the lives of Christians is the deceit of Satan who deceives us to believe that since we have been born again, we have no sin, that we can live above the temptations and desires in the lusts of the flesh in our own strength and apart from God.
[time=2232] But the scripture says we are sinners and we have sin within us in the old sin nature.
[time=2239] Listen to the words of John again, as he writes in the first chapter in the 10th verse, he says if we say that we have not sinned, we make God a liar and his word is not in us.
[time=2253] In the book of Galatians and in the fifth chapter we are told that the old nature represents itself in certain kinds of characteristics.
[time=2261] The works of the flesh which are listed for us here sound like the front page of a modern newspaper.
[time=2268] It says that the flesh exhibits itself and expresses itself through the following works, through the works known as adultery and fornication and uncleanness and lack of restraint and idolatry and sorcery and hatred and strife and jealousy and wrath and factions and seditions in heresies, in envings, in murderings, in drunkenness, in revelings and the like.
[time=2295] You say that sounds like a list of sins from Skid Row.
[time=2298] No, that's the list of the expression of the old sin nature within the life of a Christian if the spirit is not in control.
[time=2308] And that's why you can go to some churches where Christians gather and you can find strife and faction and sedition and heresy and all of the things you expect to find in the world because the old sin nature within the heart of a Christian unrestrained is capable of the most wicked of deeds to be equaled only by those deeds wrought by a totally unconverted person.
[time=2331] In fact, I would go so far as to say that a Christian who walks by the flesh probably exhibits more of the old life than a sinner who's never known the grace of God because compounding his fleshly deeds is the guilt he feels because he knows in his heart of hearts that he is not walking according to the principle of his salvation by which he was redeemed.
[time=2358] I wanna say to you that one of the reasons why there's so much sin among Christians today is that we refuse to accept the fact that the old sin nature is still with us.
[time=2371] Someone has said that the Christian life could be pictured as a wagon and hitched to one end of the wagon is the new nature and hitched to the other end is the old nature and they are in a mortal tug of war, one against the other.
[time=2389] And the scripture here in Galatians tells us that that is true.
[time=2394] That is the first reason I would share with you.
[time=2398] I would secondly like to point out to you that one of the reasons why there's so much sin in the Christian world and among Christians.
[time=2408] And I believe as I have studied these passages of scripture and have allowed the word of God to make its total impact upon my own heart and mind and studying this truth that this may be at the core and may be closer to where we are than anything I'm going to say today or next week as we continue this study.
[time=2428] And that is this.
[time=2429] There is so much sin among Christians today because we will not accept the responsibility for our own holiness and obedience to God.
[time=2440] The theme verse of so many Christians in this whole concept of passive Christianity is found in the Old Testament.
[time=2448] It goes like this, stand still and see the might of God.
[time=2453] We have many Christians who are standing still waiting for God to make them holy, waiting for God to do something to them that God tells us where to do for ourselves.
[time=2465] I hear people quote the verses of scripture from the book of Philippians that go like this.
[time=2470] For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[time=2476] And that's a great truth.
[time=2477] But I want to remind you that right before that verse in the exact previous verse is the truth that we are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=2487] And I believe that as a Christian community, as a church, as a body of believers, worldwide, perhaps we have swung the pendulum over to total dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit-filled life and a passive approach to the Spirit-filled life, to the extent where we have lost all concept of our own personal responsibility to take the word of God and apply it to our own lives and make that our own responsibility as Christians.
[time=2519] Now to be sure, there is no Christian who has the strength within him to carry out the precepts of the word of God.
[time=2525] But there is such a thing as the divine cooperative.
[time=2529] And men and women, we will never be creatures of holiness and men and women who walk according to the principles of the word of God if we adopt an attitude of passivity, which says, I'm just going to sit still and let God do it for me.
[time=2542] For God has called us to action in terms of holiness.
[time=2546] And I don't want that to be just the word of an impassioned preacher.
[time=2551] I want it to be the word of God that comes right out of the pages of the scripture.
[time=2556] And so in these next few minutes, I want to share with you a number of passages where that is presented to us as our responsibility in the Christian faith.
[time=2565] The Bible tells us that we are responsible for our own holiness.
[time=2573] We are to pursue it, we are to walk after it.
[time=2576] It is interesting to me that in the pages of the Epistles of Paul, where we find the most mature presentation of the gospel, of the Christian life, that we are not told to wait for the spirit, but we are told to walk in the spirit.
[time=2594] We are not told to receive the spirit, we are told to be filled with the spirit.
[time=2599] There are many Christians who are willing to wait and are hoping to receive, but the Bible says we're to walk in the spirit, and we are to be filled with the spirit, and that is a command which we are to obey.
[time=2610] Now the Bible tells us that as Christians, we have many privileges that are ours because of our faith in Jesus Christ, but every privilege we have as Christians carries with it a similar responsibility which we are to carry out as we walk in the newness of life.
[time=2627] The Bible says in Ephesians chapter five that we are to walk in the spirit.
[time=2633] It does not say that the spirit of God will walk in us.
[time=2636] It says we are to walk in the spirit.
[time=2638] That means we must take a step to allow the spirit of God to control our lives.
[time=2644] It does not mean we're to sit in a room someplace waiting for the spirit to come upon us, but we are to go forward in the power of the spirit, and that requires action on our part.
[time=2653] Turn in your Bibles to the book of Romans chapter six.
[time=2657] I want to share with you two or three verses, and I want you to notice the responsibility in these verses and upon whom that responsibility is placed.
[time=2666] Romans chapter six and verse 12, let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in its lust.
[time=2677] Let not sin reign in your bodies.
[time=2680] Notice chapter chapter six verse 13, neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
[time=2697] Turn over in your Bibles to Romans chapter 13 and verse 14.
[time=2702] Romans 13, verse 14.
[time=2705] But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
[time=2714] Now let me ask you so far, upon whom does the spirit of God place the responsibility for the action involved in the holy life of Christianity?
[time=2725] He places it squarely upon the shoulders of every Christian.
[time=2728] He places it upon your shoulders and upon mine, and he says to us, and he would say to us today, if you're going to be men and women who honor God with your lives, then there are certain things that you must take by way of obedience and put them into practice in your life.
[time=2743] And if you refuse to do that, the spirit of God will not do for you, what he has called you to do for yourself.
[time=2749] Listen to Paul as he writes to the Colossians in chapter three and verse five.
[time=2756] He writes put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature.
[time=2760] Colossians three and verse five.
[time=2763] Hebrews chapter 12 and verse one.
[time=2766] After reminding us that we serve before so great a cloud of witnesses, the writer of Hebrews says, therefore because of this fact, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us.
[time=2780] He says to us, you lay it aside, don't you get weighted down with it, you get that out of your life, you purge that from your existence.
[time=2788] James chapter four and verse seven says, submit yourselves to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=2795] Second Peter chapter three and verse 14 says, be diligent to be found spotless and blameless and at peace with him.
[time=2803] In second Peter chapter one, verses five through seven, we read these words.
[time=2808] And beside this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge, temperance, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2816] It says to us, give diligence to it.
[time=2819] You add it, you do it, you get involved in the process.
[time=2823] It says in James chapter one, verse 25, that we are to be those who continue in the word of God.
[time=2830] In first Timothy chapter four, verses seven, 15 and 16, we read these words, but refuse profane and old wives' fables.
[time=2841] But listen now, exercise thyself unto godliness, meditate upon these things, give thyself holy to them, that thy profiting may appear to all, take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine, continue in them, for in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself in them that hear ye.
[time=2861] Jude verse 20 says, beloved, we are to build up ourselves in the most holy faith, on and on I could go.
[time=2867] No, I am not preaching a doctrine of do-it-yourself righteousness.
[time=2872] No, I am not discounting the ministry of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[time=2876] No, I am not saying that we can do all things of ourselves without Christ.
[time=2881] But men and women, I am saying that we have let the pendulum of passivity in the doctrine of holiness and righteousness swing so far in the direction of weight, and let God do it, that we are not seeing the commands of God which are to us as individuals, that we are to do the part God has given us to do, and in doing it, the Spirit of God will strengthen us and empower us, and Jesus Christ will be there to give us the ability to do what He's called us to do.
[time=2911] I see among Christians, men and women who are sitting around waiting for God to do for them what God has said, they are to be involved in doing themselves.
[time=2920] Now one distinguishing factor between fleshly effort,
[time=2927] now listen clearly, one distinguishing factor between fleshly effort, and sanctified effort, or godly effort, is our motive.
[time=2937] That's where the rub comes in.
[time=2939] If I exercise myself unto godliness out of a spirit of dread, or if I do it as an attempt to make myself acceptable to God, then I frustrate the grace of God because you see, righteousness does not come by keeping rules, it is a gift from God.
[time=2960] But rather walking in the spirit, living the Christian life as God intended us to live it, means a regular, an active, and diligent use of all of the means of grace, which are available to me in the Christian experience.
[time=2975] It means prayer and meditation on the words of God, it means church attendance, it means fellowship with other Christians, it means witnessing, it means personal evangelism and giving, and all of the graces which God has given to me.
[time=2990] And there's enough of this passivity among Christians today, where we ignore the clear commands of the word of God, and we sit back waiting for God to make us holy when we are ignoring the means He has given us in the pathway toward holiness and righteousness in the Christian life.
[time=3008] Inevitably, in our counseling ministries, we talk to people who are in trouble or hurting, or down the road toward defeat and discouragement in their life, and when we begin to ask them the questions relating to these simple means of grace, they can say nothing but no, I don't do that, no, I don't do that, no, I'm not doing that, no, I'm not involved in that, no, I don't come to church, no, I'm not giving as I should, and what are they saying?
[time=3030] They're saying, I'm waiting for God to do something for me, but I'm not following the command of His word, which is addressed to me personally.
[time=3039] One of the reasons why there is so much sin among Christians is because you and I refuse to accept the responsibility for our own walk with God.
[time=3053] I don't know how you find it in your life, but I'll tell you something, God doesn't hit me with a bowl of lightning, get me out of bed in the morning.
[time=3062] Hasn't happened to me all week.
[time=3064] I tell Christian, young people, if you get the first foot out, God will get the next one out for you.
[time=3069] Will not be the kind of men and women
[time=3075] God wants us to be unless we're willing to take the responsibility for the personal exercise of discipline in our own lives to avail ourselves of the means of grace that is to us?
[time=3086] I want to hasten on to say thirdly, that there is so much sin among Christians, first of all, because we do not acknowledge the presence of the old sin nature in our life.
[time=3097] Secondly, because we do not accept the responsibility for our own walk with God, and thirdly, because we do not appropriate the means of holiness available to us.
[time=3109] I believe with all of my heart that the missing ingredient, the missing key to the believer's walk with God today is a very simple word.
[time=3120] It is the word obedience.
[time=3125] It seems to me as I study the spiritual life that it is like a large city with many roads which all seem to lead back to one basic hub and that hub is the word of God.
[time=3143] You say the key to walking faithfully and obediently and righteously with God is to be filled with the spirit.
[time=3149] Oh, yes, that's true.
[time=3151] But in the passage that says we're to be filled with the spirit in Ephesians, there is that corresponding passage in Colossians which expresses to us that spirit-filled believers, our word-filled believers.
[time=3164] There is no such thing as a spirit-filled Christian if he is not filled with the word of Christ and so it brings us back to the word of God.
[time=3172] And it is not enough for us just to have the word and to read it, but we are to be obedient to it.
[time=3177] We are always talking about how defeated we are.
[time=3183] Oh, this thing that I'm involved with has got me so defeated.
[time=3187] I am so defeated by this habit.
[time=3189] No, you're disobedient.
[time=3192] That's the issue.
[time=3194] When we talk about being defeated, it's a cop-out.
[time=3197] It's an easy way out for us.
[time=3198] It's a way for us to say it's not my responsibility, something else, someone else, some principle is defeating me.
[time=3206] And we will never get over that until we are willing to say, oh God, I am where I am because your word has spoken and I have disobeyed disobedience.
[time=3222] The key to the Christian life is so simple that it's almost amusing to say it.
[time=3228] Trust and obey for there's no other way
[time=3234] to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey obedience.
[time=3239] And I'm committed to the fact that God in heaven is waiting to see what will happen with a group of Christians who have unqualified, unreserved obedience to him in every area of their life, who will go forward according to every precept of his word, who will look at every area of their life in light of his word.
[time=3258] And if it is in conflict with the word of God, we'll cut that out of their lives that they might be what God would have them to be.
[time=3264] Oh, how he longs to see men and women who will embrace obedience.
[time=3269] Not talking about victorious living, but talking about obedient living.
[time=3273] Not worried about being successful as Christians, but worried about being men and women who obey God with the whole heart.
[time=3281] Oh, may he raise up a crop of Christians in this church to go along with those who already have embraced that truth to be men and women of obedience, shall we pray.
[time=3292] Our Father, we would pray today,
[time=3298] men and women who hear the words of this message will understand that you have made provision for us, that there stands one ready to help us.
[time=3311] He asks only that we open the door of our lives to let him in and he comes in through the word.
[time=3316] Oh, what a tragedy.
[time=3319] That day by day God stands ready to help us be holy.
[time=3323] And we lock him out of our lives because we will not open that book where his person is contained.
[time=3332] Lord, we pray that you will help us to be willing to say today in our own hearts, Father, I have been disobedient.
[time=3339] It's not a matter of my victory or defeat.
[time=3342] I've just been disobedient to you.
[time=3344] I have not been meditating upon your word.
[time=3347] I have been locking you out of my life.
[time=3349] No wonder I'm failing.
[time=3351] But today I open the door of fellowship and ask you to come in through your word to fill my life that I might be victoriously obedient to thee.
