[time=0] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=24] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jaramah.
[time=54] Thank you for that fine singing, and you may be seated.
[time=80] How many of us who are Christians have discovered as we look back over our lives at some particular
[time=86] period that we are reflecting upon some one occasion, perhaps months ago or years ago,
[time=94] when our hearts were overflowing with the thrill of God's presence.
[time=100] And then we remember that something happened.
[time=103] We're not exactly sure what, but the glory and the joy seem to be abated and gone.
[time=110] The fervor of our affection for God seemed to have died away.
[time=115] The visible motions and all of the outward activity continued and the friends of ours at church considered that we were just as we had always been.
[time=124] But in our hearts, we knew something was wrong.
[time=129] We went to church, we went to prayer meeting, we kept up all of the outward appearance.
[time=134] But then we tried reading books, discovering remedies, oftentimes running from the feet
[time=140] of one giant Bible teacher to another.
[time=144] In this generation we bought tapes and listened to them, trying to figure out what was wrong, what was missing in our life.
[time=151] We may have been involved in hundreds of miles of travel to discover the missing ingredient.
[time=158] Sometimes we would leave the meetings excited, feeling we had recovered what was lost.
[time=164] But within a week or so, the walls of our theoretical castle would be crumbled in a heap at our feet.
[time=173] We were still anemic, still powerless, and still inconsistent.
[time=179] How many of us at times have felt that emotion?
[time=183] I am certain that's what Paul was talking about when he penned the words of the seventh chapter of the book of Romans.
[time=189] It is the experience of every Christian at one time or another in his life if he is honest.
[time=194] And it is the cry of all of us that we would be learning more and more how to be consistent in living this life of Christianity.
[time=202] Today in our study in the Word of God, we will open the pages of the New Testament to what I believe is the most critical doctrine for consistent, godly living and examine what God has to say to us as we cry out for the consistent life.
[time=220] First of all, we have some music, and it's a wonderful privilege for us to welcome back to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, Himon Al-Paraki, and his wife, Zoni.
[time=232] And there from the Philippine Islands, saved while in the Philippine Islands because of some missionaries that were sent there, and now wonderfully gifted musicians who are back here in this country, sharing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ through music.
[time=246] They're going to sing for us now one of the old favorites of the faith, amazing grace,
[time=253] how sweet the sound.
[time=256] We have come to worship God, and for God's redeemed people, it's a blood-bought privilege.
[time=264] For by grace are we saved through faith, amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved the
[time=275] wretch like me, I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=299] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=325] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=348] I once was lost, but now I'm found, I once was lost, but now I'm found, and I'm found,
[time=377] and I'm found, and I'm found, and I'm found, and I'm found, and I'm found, and I'm found
[time=483] Thank you, Alperonkeys. The Psalmist writes in the 27th Psalm, "The Lord is my light and
[time=500] my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be
[time=508] afraid, and that Psalm has been put to music in one of the great songs of the faith. The Lord is
[time=514] my light." Zoni Alperaki is joined by our choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they share with
[time=521] us this great anthem of praise.
[time=538] The Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom then shall I fear, whom then shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life.
[time=562] The Lord is the strength of my life. The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid, afraid.
[time=577] The Lord is the passion of lies against me, yet you're not my heart, be afraid, and though there isn't
[time=598] [MUSIC - 125 seconds]
[time=748] (gentle music) - Ever since the Bible hour has been on the air,
[time=761] now over four years, we have been taking this time during the Offertory here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to sit and talk with you at home so that we might have personal time to discuss with our many Bible hour friends those matters which pertain to you individually.
[time=779] We do not like to take the time in our service to talk about books and other things that would be of help to you at home.
[time=787] So this is a perfect opportunity for us to step aside while another activity is taking place in our auditorium and spend the time profitably as we converse with you at home.
[time=798] I'm so glad that my wife Donna can join me each week.
[time=801] Donna, we get letters almost every week from the gals who appreciate the fact that you and I can talk together and they identify with you and listen very carefully to everything you say.
[time=811] - I appreciate that and also I understand that we've had several requests to have the baby on again.
[time=817] So one of these days soon we're gonna bring the whole family on so that you'll have a chance to get to know them too.
[time=822] - We had hoped to do that at Christmas time but I don't remember what happened.
[time=826] I think with the living Christmas tree and all of the presentations that kept us out every night, it just wasn't possible but we will do it again soon.
[time=833] During this time we have been sharing with our friends at Home Honey the importance of Bible study and a very exciting little tool that just really has caught on like almost nothing we've ever done in terms of enthusiasm and excitement.
[time=846] We've had people come into the office, people call us on the phone and then of course all of the standard means of getting to us to make sure that they get their own personal copy of the four gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=859] What's so special about it?
[time=862] - It's special in that if you're studying a particular portion of scripture and it's recorded in several of the gospels it's all right there together and you don't have to flip from one gospel to the next to find that particular record of it.
[time=875] It's all right there in one concise paragraph.
[time=877] - And it's so much fun to read the gospels this way.
[time=881] It adds to your understanding of each event in the life of our Lord so much as opposed to just reading the individual gospels.
[time=888] And we have found that people who have used this in their own personal study of the gospels have gained a greater understanding of the sequence of events in the New Testament as well as well just a real appetite to want to read through the entire sections of our Lord's life and appreciate them.
[time=906] And of course in the back of this book there are some helps that I'm sure many of our Bible students who share the Bible hour would be very encouraged by a list of the events of the Lord's life and makes it easy to find them doesn't it?
[time=922] - I know sometimes I get so frustrated when I'm trying to find a particular passage and I think I know right where it is and I have a terrible time finding it.
[time=930] And so this book is great for those of us who have that problem.
[time=933] You just turn to the back of the book and look for the particular miracle or parable that you're interested in and it tells you right where to turn to it.
[time=940] - Now I was reading this week in a book published some time ago about the number of events in the life of our Lord.
[time=948] How many different special things there are that He did such as His miracles and the parables and His sayings and His sermons and oh they're just such a list of them, such a long list.
[time=959] And yet if they're organized properly it's so easy to find them and it's so helpful to have it right there with your Bible.
[time=965] One of the things I appreciate about the book is that it's not a great big dictionary sized book.
[time=970] You know some of those books are great if you never have to take them off your table.
[time=974] This would even fit in your purse I believe.
[time=976] (laughing) - Maybe in some of them.
[time=979] Well we might have to do a little reorganization in the purses but I think it would fit in there and it's just the same size as my Bible so it's just a convenient little book to carry with you to church even, you know along with your Bible so that you can study it and derive a great deal of benefit from it.
[time=995] - And if you would like to have this little booklet that we have been talking about the way to obtain your copy is to call our toll free number.
[time=1004] That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1009] Just ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like to receive the booklet on the four gospels.
[time=1016] They will get in touch with us and within a few days we will have it in the mail to you.
[time=1020] That number again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1025] - And then I want to encourage you if you would to take the time this week to drop us a note and let us know that you're a part of the Bible hour ministry.
[time=1036] We do read your letters as they come to our office and we thank God for the privilege of hearing from you.
[time=1041] Just this past week at a special get together for all those involved in the Christmas program, we shared some of the letters that came from our viewing audience concerning the Living Christmas Tree special and they were tremendous blessings to our choir people.
[time=1054] You cannot know how valuable your correspondence to us really is.
[time=1059] Once you sit down right now and write to me Pastor David Jeremiah, let us know that you're viewing the telecast, tell us what station you're watching and then if you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of televising this program each Sunday.
[time=1073] I cannot begin to tell you the staggering costs to put together this presentation and it's for your benefit.
[time=1079] We know that many of you, along with your systematic giving to your own local church, which we believe is priority, will want to be a part of specially supporting this telecast as it reaches into your home.
[time=1091] We need your help, especially at this time and we would appreciate your writing to us today.
[time=1096] When you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1104] Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1111] If you want to receive your free copy of this book, The Four Gospels Arranged is a Single Narrative, Donna, share with them how they do that.
[time=1120] That toll-free number once again is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1125] And I would encourage you, if the line is busy, to keep trying because if you call during this hour, particularly, that's when it's the most busy, but that number is available any time of the week, any day, and you can call it and just ask for the Bible Hour Operator and she will get in touch with us.
[time=1144] - Now in just a few moments, we're going to open the scriptures to address ourself to the question, why can I not be more consistent in my Christian life?
[time=1152] And I'm going to be preaching on what it means to be a spirit-filled Christian.
[time=1158] One of the most important topics we've touched upon in many weeks, I hope you will have your Bibles ready and open to the fifth chapter of Ephesians, a paper and a pen and a Bible so that you can study with us and take down some notes.
[time=1173] I believe God will use his word today to encourage and instruct your heart.
[time=1178] Thank you for sharing this little time with us and now it's time for us to get back to our morning service and our special music.
[time=1184] I know that God is using it to bless your heart today.
[time=1187] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=1209] - What a beautiful song of triumph.
[time=1211] Thank you very much and you may be seated.
[time=1214] We've been enjoying this morning the music, the musical ministry of Himon and Zoni Alparake.
[time=1221] This is a very special treat for me to have them here because we have been friends all for years and years.
[time=1228] I arranged the music for their wedding some 10 years ago and we've been friends ever since.
[time=1233] And I'm so glad now to present to you again for their ministry in music, Heimon and Zoni Alparake.
[time=1240] - The Savior is waiting to enter your heart.
[time=1245] Why don't you let Him come in?
[time=1248] There's nothing in this world to keep you apart.
[time=1252] Say to Him, come in today.
[time=1256] (gentle music)
[time=1268] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=1415] - Behold, I stand at the door and knock the Savior set.
[time=1429] If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into Him.
[time=1434] For many of us, we've made this decision before.
[time=1438] We've opened our hearts door to Jesus Christ and invited Him in to be our Savior from sin.
[time=1444] But after that, Christ wants to be a permanent dweller in our hearts and lives.
[time=1452] Christ must dwell in our hearts by faith.
[time=1456] He must feel at home and He must have access to every door, every part of our hearts and lives.
[time=1463] And even as Christians, there are many, many doors in our hearts, lives, that we need to open to the Savior again and again.
[time=1473] Our Savior who was willing to leave a throne for a cross, a canopy of glory, for a canopy of darkness,
[time=1486] the bosom of the Father for a pillow of stone.
[time=1489] What made Him willing to do that?
[time=1491] His wonderful grace of humility and love.
[time=1497] His only comes with a song that exclaims, "What grace is this that brought my Savior down."
[time=1505] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=1641] - Thank you Alperakis, and for those of you who are a part of the Black Hawk family, your special treat for the day is that they're going to be here tonight and you'll want to be here to share in their music.
[time=1655] Your Bibles now should be open to the book of Ephesians and the fifth chapter, and I want to read very quickly four verses of scripture, which will provide for us the answer to today's question.
[time=1670] How can I live a consistent Christian life?
[time=1674] Ephesians chapter five, verses 18 through 21, and be not drunk with wine in which is excess, but be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God, shall we pray.
[time=1707] Our Father, we ask that in these few moments, you will unfold to us by the spirit of God, that truth which you would have for each of us today, some who are old in the faith, some who have just begun their journey with the Lord, some who perhaps began a long time ago only to find themselves discouraged and defeated, some who need just a word of encouragement and the underscoring of those principles in their lives, which they know to be true and are practicing to the best of their ability.
[time=1740] But for all of us today, our Father, we come with a heart that is hungry to hear from God, and the truth from him that may be applicable to our own lives as we walk with you day by day, in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1756] The Bible does not waste words when it gives answers to the questions of life.
[time=1761] If you were to ask me today, how may a Christian keep from fulfilling the lust of the flesh in his own life being a consistent Christian, a consistent follower of the Lord, I would be able to give to you one verse of scripture from the book of Galatians, which would have for you the answer.
[time=1781] For that verse found in the last part of the book of Galatians says this, walk by means of the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.
[time=1794] As simple as it may be, as cut and dried as it may sound, the scripture says that when we are walking by means of the spirit, we cannot at one in the same time be fulfilling the lust of the flesh.
[time=1806] We cannot be controlled by the spirit of God and controlled by the old nature, which destroys our consistent walk.
[time=1814] So we do not have to wait to the end of this message to arrive at the conclusion or the answer to the question.
[time=1821] Men and women of God, the secret to a consistent, godly life, the fellowship unbroken with the Father is that you walk by means of the spirit of God.
[time=1831] For the scripture promises us that when we do that, we will not fall prey to the old nature and the inconsistencies which are a part of it.
[time=1840] Mark it down in your spiritual notebook that there is no inconsistency with God, either the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
[time=1848] His life is a consistent life.
[time=1851] All of the inconsistencies that we feel, the ups and downs of our lives, the roller coaster experience of so many of God's people is not an attributed problem to God, but it is our problem.
[time=1864] The scripture says when we walk by means of the spirit, we will not be fulfilling the lust of the flesh.
[time=1872] Now there is a wonderful doctrine of the spirit of God in the New Testament.
[time=1877] Walking by means of the spirit means that we are to be controlled by the spirit of God in our everyday life.
[time=1885] Galatians tells us how it works and the program for it and Ephesians gives to us the command that all Christians are to be filled with the spirit of God.
[time=1896] This is necessary for a number of reasons.
[time=1899] First of all, because as individuals, as Christians, without God working in us and through us, we cannot do anything that will glorify Him.
[time=1910] John 15.5 tells us that without Christ, we can do nothing.
[time=1915] In the book of Romans, chapter eight and verse eight, we are told that in our flesh, we cannot please God, that without God, nothing about us will please the Father.
[time=1926] Now the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit living within us is Christ's presence within our lives.
[time=1933] In the 14th chapter of the book of John, in verse 16, we read these words, Jesus Christ speaking.
[time=1940] He said, I will pray the Father and He shall give you another comforter that He may abide with you forever.
[time=1947] The promise of Jesus Christ of the Holy Spirit to come.
[time=1951] But just two or three verses beyond that in the 18th verse of the 14th chapter, the words of our Savior interpret that promise.
[time=1960] He writes, I will not leave you comfortless.
[time=1963] I will come to you.
[time=1966] Which is a reminder to us that though we believe in the three distinct persons of the Godhead, the scripture teaches that the Holy Spirit, dwelling within every believer, is the presence of Christ within that person.
[time=1979] That's why in the book of Romans, it says, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[time=1985] You cannot have the Spirit of God without having Christ.
[time=1989] You cannot have Christ without having the Spirit of God.
[time=1992] Men and women, it is impossible to live the Christian life without Jesus Christ.
[time=1997] And it is impossible to be consistent in your life unless Jesus Christ is the controlling principle within your life.
[time=2004] The Holy Spirit controlling you day by day.
[time=2008] Christ in the believer is there in the person of the Holy Spirit to give us power where we otherwise are powerless.
[time=2016] If we are filled with the Spirit of God controlled by the Spirit of God, then Christ is working his life out through us.
[time=2023] If we are not filled with the Spirit of God, then we are operating in the Spirit of the flesh and we will be nothing but inconsistent failures up and down with every whim of humanity that is available to us.
[time=2037] It is important that we be filled with the Spirit of God first of all, because without him we are helpless to live the Christian life.
[time=2045] Secondly, we must be filled with the Spirit of God because of the total dependence upon the Holy Spirit that the Bible teaches us as Christians.
[time=2054] Are you aware of the fact that the characteristics of the Christian life are called the fruit of the Spirit?
[time=2060] All of the nine temperament graces recorded for us in the book of Galatians are an outgrowth of the Spirit of God controlling your life.
[time=2068] Romans 8 verses 26 and 27 tells us that even our prayer life is controlled by the Spirit of God.
[time=2076] And in Acts 1 and verse eight, we are reminded that apart from the Spirit of God, we cannot have power to witness.
[time=2083] The Lord Jesus Christ commanded the disciples that they were to await the empowering of the Holy Spirit before they went out to share the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ.
[time=2093] All that we are and all that we do in the Christian life is dependent upon the empowering of the Spirit of God.
[time=2100] We are also needing the Holy Spirit to control and to empower us because the Bible sets forth standards of living for Christianity which are beyond the reach of human flesh.
[time=2114] Now sometimes when I hear Christians talking about the old and the New Testament, I get the rather strange impression that because the law is no longer binding upon Christians of New Testament times that God has a much lower standard for those of us who live in this day than he did for the Jews in Old Testament times.
[time=2133] May I remind you that nine of the 10 commandments which were given to the Old Testament Jews have been reiterated in the New Testament to every Christian, the only exception being the Sabbath law.
[time=2146] May I remind you that the Word of God in the New Testament commands us to do things which humanly are impossible.
[time=2153] The Bible tells us that as Christians, we are to love one another as Christ loved us who in human flesh can accomplish such an objective.
[time=2161] The Bible tells us that we are to bring every thought into obedience unto God, a task which is beyond the capability for even one day of the most determined Christian.
[time=2173] The Bible tells us in the New Testament that we are to give thanks for all things and in every season and how many of us have struggled with our inability to give thanks during the difficult times.
[time=2185] The New Testament instructs us that we are to show forth the praises of him that have forgotten us, that have called us.
[time=2192] The Bible tells us we are to rejoice ever more and to pray without ceasing on and on.
[time=2197] I could go those sound like supernatural requirements.
[time=2200] Do they not?
[time=2202] And indeed they are.
[time=2204] Those are the requirements of a supernatural life which under no circumstances can be lived in the flesh.
[time=2210] Last week in our study, we were reminded that it is important for us to assume the responsibility for our own spiritual lives.
[time=2218] That is to reckon that we stand before God as individuals accountable for where we are spiritually.
[time=2225] But that in no way is to intimate to one of us that in our own strength or power we can live a life which is on a supernatural plane.
[time=2233] The Bible says we cannot do that.
[time=2235] If the spirit of God does not empower us, we cannot be fruitful Christians.
[time=2242] Now when it comes to the doctrine of the filling of the spirit, generally speaking, there are three or four problems that are connected with it.
[time=2250] As you talk with Christians around this world today here in our own area and wherever you go among Christendom, you will discover that there are several different levels of understanding about the Holy Spirit.
[time=2263] First of all, there are some who frankly claim to be totally ignorant of the doctrine.
[time=2268] They're like those in the New Testament book of Acts who when asked if they had received the Holy Spirit answered we have not even heard so much as if there is a Holy Spirit.
[time=2279] Many Christians today know there's a problem of disagreement about the Holy Spirit so they decide that it's optional baggage and they just slough it off.
[time=2287] They don't want to talk about it.
[time=2288] They don't want to discuss it.
[time=2289] They would rather remain ignorant.
[time=2291] Or as someone has said, they would rather keep their mouth shut about the doctrine and have people think they were ignorant than open their mouth about the doctrine and remove all doubt.
[time=2300] And I suppose there are some even here who may feel that way about that doctrine.
[time=2305] Secondly, there are among some Christians today, those whom I would say are involved in the indulgence of the doctrine.
[time=2312] By that I mean they have gone to great excesses, wrenching it out of the context of the tension which it is found in the New Testament, raising it above the level of all other doctrines, worshiping at the throne of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and going to all kinds of excesses to express that doctrine in their own personal experience and life.
[time=2332] Thirdly, there are some who missed the point of the filling of the Holy Spirit and the right appreciation of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit because they have embraced an intellectualism about the doctrine.
[time=2344] They can tell you all there is to know about the Holy Spirit.
[time=2348] They are intellectually proper and right, but they have refused to believe that the Holy Spirit has been given to us to provide blessing and appreciation in our own lives.
[time=2358] And so they have gone clear to the other extreme in the pendulum that swings back and forth, centering in the middle upon the right concept of the doctrine.
[time=2367] Now in the book of Ephesians, we are given a command from God.
[time=2371] That command is not an option for any believer.
[time=2373] It is the command found in the 18th verse which says, "We are to be filled with the Spirit of God." In the 18th verse, there are two imperative phrases.
[time=2384] The first one is, "Be not drunk with wine, we're in his excess." And the second one is, "But be filled with the Spirit of God." Now in our understanding of the doctrine of the filling of the Spirit of God, we can gain much truth from this very short passage.
[time=2400] First of all, you need to understand that in the 18th verse, the term "be filled" is a present tense, continuous action command.
[time=2409] That means we are to continually, over and over again, be being filled.
[time=2414] It is a reoccurring expression, a reoccurring experience in the life of the believer.
[time=2420] It is quite opposed to the once-for-all baptism of the Spirit which occurs, according to 1 Corinthians 10, 13, at the moment of our salvation.
[time=2429] It is opposed to the once-for-all in dwelling of the Spirit of God when he comes to dwell within us at the moment of our conversion and stays within us for the rest of our lives as Christians.
[time=2440] The filling of the Spirit is that matter whereby the Spirit of God takes control of our lives.
[time=2446] And over and over again in our Christian experience, we discover that as we yield ourself to the control of the Spirit of God, he controls us.
[time=2454] It is possible as a Christian to be a born-again, God-fearing, Bible-loving Christian on your way to heaven and be not filled with the Spirit of God.
[time=2463] It is not possible to be a Christian without the Spirit of God.
[time=2467] It is possible to be a Christian and not have the Spirit of God controlling your life day by day.
[time=2473] Mark it down that the word fill means to be controlled by.
[time=2477] It is not a matter of whether or not you have the Holy Spirit.
[time=2480] It is a matter of whether or not the Holy Spirit has you.
[time=2484] It is a matter of the Holy Spirit not being a resident in your life, but is being the president of your life.
[time=2489] Is he controlling your life now?
[time=2491] Paul said to the Ephesians, "Be ye being filled with the Holy Spirit." We can learn something from this passage by the analogy which Paul uses.
[time=2502] First of all, in contrast.
[time=2504] He says, "Be not drunk, but be filled." Some people have taken this to believe that being filled with the Spirit is sort of like a spiritual inebriation.
[time=2516] In other words, it is the same thing spiritually that happens to us physically when we get drunk with wine.
[time=2522] May I remind you that the New Testament tells us that one of the temperament traits of a Spirit-filled Christian is that he is self-controlled.
[time=2532] There is no evidence from this text that being a Spirit-filled Christian means you should be spiritually inebriated, babbling like a drunken idiot.
[time=2540] The Scripture says you are to be filled with the Spirit of God, and that means you will have certain characteristics in your life which we will examine.
[time=2551] I want you also to notice that there is something we can learn from this word, from Paul, concerning drunkenness and Spirit-filledness.
[time=2562] Person who is drunk is under the control of liquor in his bloodstream and acts in ways unnatural to him.
[time=2573] I praise God for the fact that I've never tasted that stuff and I wouldn't know what it was like to be drunk 'cause I've never even gotten it close enough to my nose to smell it.
[time=2583] I grew up in a godly home where it never was in our house and I never had the temptation to drink it and I'm not on a booze sermon this morning, but while I've got a chance, I'm gonna tell you I think the stuff's rotten and you ought to stay away from it.
[time=2594] Now, that's for free, I just threw that in, all right?
[time=2597] Not anything that I know about it that's good.
[time=2602] When I was a student in Dallas Seminar, I worked at the Dolphus Hotel.
[time=2607] And I remember night after night, working all night, watching the cleaning crew and helping their, them carrying people out who were drunk.
[time=2615] And they tell me that when a person is drunk, if he's a very quiet person, he's apt to be very boisterous and loud.
[time=2621] If he's a very shy person, afraid of any physical combat, he's liable to take on the biggest man in the party and fight him.
[time=2629] That the influence of alcohol and the bloodstream of an individual causes that person to be something totally other than they would normally and naturally be.
[time=2640] I mean, I say to you that when the spirit of God controls your life, spiritually speaking, that very same thing happens to you.
[time=2647] No, you don't become the kind of a person who is filled with excess, erratic or irrational, but you begin to exhibit characteristics in your life that are not natural for you.
[time=2661] If you are an impatient person, all of a sudden people begin to notice that you have developed within your life patients.
[time=2669] If you do not have long suffering, it begins to develop in your life.
[time=2673] Everything that's in that list of the fruit of the spirit becomes characteristically true of you.
[time=2678] And for most of us, there are two or three things on that list that are not natural characteristics of our lives.
[time=2684] In fact, I was reading that list the other day and I think I failed on all nine of them naturally.
[time=2690] How grateful I am that the spirit of God can empower me and make me something that I am not.
[time=2696] That is what the filling of the spirit is.
[time=2698] The spirit of God living within us, making us to be other than we would naturally be.
[time=2704] We are to be filled with the spirit.
[time=2706] Now, what should we normally expect of a spirit-filled Christian?
[time=2711] Oh, how we have gone to seed on this doctrine.
[time=2715] I want to say right now, and I'm not picking a fight with anybody, that the spirit-filled life has to do not with what we say or how we express ourselves or the outward overt actions of a person nearly so much as it has to do with what we are as individuals.
[time=2736] In the text of Ephesians chapter five, there are these two imperatives and following the two imperatives are four participles which are listed in the text qualifying and telling us what consequences we could normally and naturally expect from a spirit-filled person.
[time=2753] Let me point them out to you.
[time=2755] First of all, verse 19, it says be filled with the spirit and the result of that will be that you will be speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[time=2768] Now, to correct the text so that it really says what it says, you need to say that that verse is saying, not that we're speaking to ourselves, you are a little suspicious of a person who does that, but it is a reflexive word which means to be speaking to one another, to be encouraging one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[time=2790] So one of the first results that you should expect if your life is controlled by the spirit of God is that you begin to have a concern for others and there is a ministry from you out to that person.
[time=2801] You are ministering to one another.
[time=2803] There is an other consciousness in your life as you reach out to serve.
[time=2807] Whereas before you may have been self-centered now, you find your life reaching out in service to others in the body of Christ.
[time=2815] The second participle in the text is the word singing in your heart, making melody in your heart to the Lord.
[time=2822] That means to magnify the Lord.
[time=2824] And will you notice it is a precept of genuineness.
[time=2829] It doesn't mean making melody with your lips.
[time=2831] It means making melody with your heart.
[time=2833] There should be a genuineness of your life that overflows outwardly to others in an expression of joy.
[time=2840] Thirdly, we are told that there will be satisfaction in our life.
[time=2845] Always giving thanks for all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.
[time=2853] The third result of being filled with the spirit is there will be a quality of your life that exudes a satisfied rest in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2863] Always giving thanks in all things to God.
[time=2867] There is an absence here of complaining.
[time=2871] An absence here of self-pity.
[time=2874] An absence here of a critical spirit.
[time=2876] An absence here of divisiveness and determination to divide the body of Christ.
[time=2881] A spirit-filled person is a person who is content with where he is in the plan of God.
[time=2887] And there is that wonderful spirit of satisfaction that is expressed through a thankful heart that the world can see and understand.
[time=2897] May I point out that there's also correct doctrine?
[time=2900] For it says that when we are filled with the spirit, we will be understanding the importance of the triune God.
[time=2908] We are to give thanks as the result of being filled with the spirit to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2916] There is no evidence in this text that one person of the Trinity is elevated above the others, each of them functioning in their proper perspective.
[time=2924] The spirit of God controlling me so that as I pray, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and my prayers and my praise and my gratitude ascends to the throne of God the Father, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2939] Then will you notice, fourthly, that when we are filled with the spirit, the fourth participle in this text is that we will be submitting one to another.
[time=2949] I often have preached this text and have been able to see the resistance of the women gather as we come up to the point of verse 22, which says, "Why submit yourselves to your own husbands?" Well, let me say something to you.
[time=2968] That is not a different kind of submission in many ways than the kind of submitting to one another that God says is to be true within the body of Christ.
[time=2978] We are all to be having a submissive spirit one to another in the government of the church, in the framework of doing things together.
[time=2987] There ought to be in the life of a spirit filled quick Christian, the spirit of willingness to submit to each other as it relates to the body of Christ, being subject one to another.
[time=2999] It is the general duty of Christians to be submissive one to the other.
[time=3005] As God brings you into the framework of a church and its organization and someone is put in a place of responsibility, there is no hassling over whose job it is to do what, but because you're a spirit filled Christian, you are willingly flowing into the organizational setup that is there and wonderfully and blessedly submitting one to another with a positive loving spirit.
[time=3027] That is the general responsibility of every spirit filled Christian.
[time=3030] And then of course, in the rest of the text, there are some reminders to us that there are specific responsibilities of submission, wives to their husbands, children to their parents, servants to their masters and masters to Christ.
[time=3044] But the general tone of a spirit filled Christian is that he will not be filled with self assertion, protecting his own rights, trying to get his own way, but his personal attitude will be one of a godly humility and submission.
[time=3063] Now, the result of being filled with the spirit of God is, that your personal attitudes are right, your home relationships are right, your relationships within the body of Christ are right, you exhibit a warm sincere worship of the triune God, and in your life, there is exhibited the nine temperament traits recorded in the book of Galatians.
[time=3083] It is sad to say that when we miss the truth
[time=3089] of the result of the spirit filled life and we focus in rather on ecstatic experiences and utterances, which are not related to this doctrine, the end result is we miss the basic thing that God has for us, and that is he wants to make us godly people, and the way he does that is through the filling of the Holy Spirit, and Satan has waged one of his greatest victories in our lives, if he can get our eyes off of what we ought to be, and onto what we ought to be doing, and then we miss what God has for us in the controlled spirit filled life.
[time=3124] You say, pastor, how can I be filled with the spirit?
[time=3128] In these closing moments, let me give you just a few key words that relate to it.
[time=3132] First of all, to be filled and controlled by the spirit, you must desire it.
[time=3137] That means you must want to be filled.
[time=3138] The first key word is to desire when you get a chance to read John chapter seven, verses 37 to 39.
[time=3146] In the Old Testament, we are reminded over and over again that when we want to know God personally, when we search after him, when there's a thirsting in our hearts, God meets us at the point of our need.
[time=3157] Psalm 84, too, says my soul longeth, yay, even fainted for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
[time=3166] If there is within your heart today is a Christian, the desire to live a Christian life that is consistent, and God honoring and glorifying to him, that desire is the first step toward being filled with the spirit of God.
[time=3178] If any man thirst, let him come, said Christ in John chapter seven.
[time=3183] This spakey of the spirit of God who was to be given.
[time=3187] The second key word is not the word desire, but the word denounce.
[time=3191] If you are to be filled with the spirit of God, you must denounce all known sin in your life.
[time=3197] It is useless to come to God and say, Lord, fill me when you know of sin in your life.
[time=3202] Men and women, God does not fill dirty vessels with his Holy Spirit.
[time=3208] The Holy Spirit comes to live within clean vessels and comes to fill and control clean vessels.
[time=3214] And if you want to have a godly, consistent, God honoring life, don't pray that the Holy Spirit would begin to control your life when there are known identifiable areas of sin in your life.
[time=3226] Go to 1 John 1 9, confess your sin.
[time=3228] God will forgive your sin, denounce that sin in your life.
[time=3231] And then the Holy Spirit can come to control you.
[time=3235] The first word is desire, the second word is denounce.
[time=3238] The third word is to discipline yourself to get into the word of God.
[time=3243] There is a very interesting comparison in the New Testament between Colossians and Ephesians.
[time=3250] The result of the spirit-filled life and the result of the word-filled life are exactly the same.
[time=3256] Colossians three, Ephesians five.
[time=3258] Study those two passages and you will see that to be spirit-filled is to be word-filled.
[time=3263] There is no difference really.
[time=3264] You cannot be a spirit-filled Christian without the word of God.
[time=3268] That's one of the dangers in the spiritual revolution that's taking place in our country today.
[time=3273] An idea among some people that they can have a spiritual understanding, a spiritual ecstasy without God's holy word.
[time=3280] There is no such thing as a spirit-filled Christian without a word-filled Christian.
[time=3284] Story is told of a young woman, a young man
[time=3290] who is good, gonna get married, but he was in love with two women, he didn't know which one to marry.
[time=3296] He was a Christian and he prayed, "Oh God, give me guidance.
[time=3301] Buy your spirit, guide me." So he went to church that Sunday and as he was sitting in church, an old church that had been purchased some months ago by their congregation from another congregation, he looked up at some windows he'd never seen before and at the top of the window were the words "Lave Maria," and it just so happened that one of the girl's name was Maria.
[time=3326] And so he determined that this was the will of God.
[time=3328] The spirit of God had guided him to marry Maria and so he married her and found out later that that was the wrong choice.
[time=3334] Now you see, if he had been a word-filled Christian,
[time=3341] he would have known that God does not guide his children by the colored glass windows in churches.
[time=3348] He guides his children through the principles of the word of God.
[time=3352] The spirit of God guides the child of God through the word of God and you cannot be controlled by the spirit in your own heart.
[time=3359] You say, "Oh, spirit of God, control me." And the spirit of God says, "All right, here's the map." And you say, "Well, I don't want that.
[time=3366] Just do it.
[time=3368] Oh, he won't do it.
[time=3369] He will control your life." - You've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah.
