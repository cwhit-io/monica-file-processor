[time=0] - From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=22] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jaramond.
[time=26] [MUSIC]
[time=44] - Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=46] - It is a very snowy day here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church,
[time=54] and all of you who are present in the auditorium are already aware of that.
[time=58] We congratulate you on your perseverance to be here.
[time=61] Thank you for your presence.
[time=64] Last year, according to statistics that we received recently, there were 876 churches that went bankrupt, went out of business financially.
[time=75] One does not drive throughout the countryside very often without seeing here and there a church that has been boarded up and closed.
[time=85] What is it that causes churches which once flourished with fellowship, preaching, ministry
[time=95] to go out of business financially, spiritually, and physically?
[time=100] I'm certain there are many reasons, and no one person could ever collect them all nor expound upon them all.
[time=107] But I do believe that God gives to us the instructions for a thoroughly thriving, growing, ministering, fellowshipping body of believers.
[time=119] And whenever we fail to follow the instructions, we have started in the downward directions.
[time=127] I have in my library a book that is entitled, If in Doubt, Read the Directions.
[time=134] And it's all about how churches ought to operate.
[time=138] It seems to me it would be good for us as Christians continually to be reminded that God has for us in this wonderful book all of the instruction we need for us to be everything He wants us to be.
[time=149] And what a joy it is to open the pages of this sacred text and to discover together the principles God has for us to be successful in His work and in our own personal lives.
[time=161] So in a few moments, we're going to be doing that from the book of Corinthians.
[time=164] And I hope that you'll have your Bibles ready so that we may read together and study together from the Holy Word.
[time=171] Now we have some music that we know will be an encouragement to you.
[time=175] And we want you to listen, first of all, to our sanctuary choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they sing for us great stirring song entitled Revive Us Again.
[time=186] [MUSIC]
[time=197] Hallelujah, I'm the glory, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=236] Hallelujah, for the son of thy love, for his answer
[time=244] Thy hand is now gone, oh God, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
[time=257] hallelujah, I'm the glory, free by the Son of Mary.
[time=268] Hallelujah, praise to the Lamb that was saved.
[time=274] Who has born all our sins and husbands every single day?
[time=280] Hallelujah, I'm the glory, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=287] Hallelujah, I'm the glory, free by the Son of Mary.
[time=300] Be by the Son of Mary.
[time=304] We'll be taught with thy love.
[time=308] We'll be taught with thee, we can go with our Alma Mater.
[time=317] Hallelujah, I'm the glory, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=327] God, I'm the glory, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=356] Thank you, Choir, for your ministry to us.
[time=360] We learned this week that someone who has had a great ministry to many of our people here in the Fort Wayne area at the Parkview Hospital, Chaplain Evan Bergwall, went home
[time=371] to be with the Lord quite suddenly.
[time=373] Numbers of you here in the congregation who have been at one time or another in the Parkview Hospital have no doubt been visited by and prayed with the Chaplain of the Parkview
[time=384] Hospital.
[time=385] And just express to the family and the Bergwalls and to their friends our deepest sympathy
[time=391] at this particular time and also to take this opportunity to express a word of appreciation for his ministry to so many of our people down through the years of the existence of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=404] Several weeks ago, when we began the new year in its ministry, I preached a message from
[time=410] the Old Testament book of Exodus and told you that we were selecting for this year's verse, a book, the verse from Exodus chapter 33 verse 14, which reads, "My presence shall
[time=423] go with you, and I will give you rest." After we had finished that message, numbers of people expressed appreciation for the verse of Scripture and for its content and for its promise and for the encouragement that it
[time=438] brought to them as they thought of the new year.
[time=440] In our Founders Club ministry, which involves all of those who support the television ministry regularly, each month we send out a mailing with information and the study books that
[time=451] they use and we decided to choose for this month that particular verse, "My presence
[time=457] shall go with thee, and I will give the rest." And the Scripture verses that are sent out each month are put on little placard cards that can be set on the television or on the shelf and in the living room where they can be prominently read and be a reminder to us of some scriptural truth.
[time=475] Some of the Founders Club members had them in their homes and other people have asked, "Is there any way I can get one of those to remember this year's theme verse?" I want to tell all of you who are here in the auditorium.
[time=485] If you would like to have one, we will see that you get one if you'll just mark on your envelope Scripture text and we'll see that one comes to you.
[time=494] And for those of you who are part of our extended family, if you would like to have this special Scripture text telling you to remember the theme verse for the new year for the Black Hawk Baptist Church in its ministries, if you will write to us at our address here in Fort Wayne, we'll be happy to send one to you free and postage paid.
[time=512] Some weeks ago, one of our young ladies, Star Narwhald, took off with some friends here in the church to London, England to do the recording of soundtracks for her first ever
[time=525] stereo album.
[time=527] And as she was so excited about it, we prayed together with her at the airport.
[time=531] We were headed off in another direction and she was headed to London and Don Kruger and I met with her there at the airport and her friends and joined hands in a little circle,
[time=540] laughingly around an ashtray that was in the middle of the floor.
[time=545] And we prayed together that God would give her a wonderful trip in the beginning of a great ministry.
[time=551] And she returned and just recently brought to me a cassette of the beautiful soundtracks
[time=557] that were recorded there.
[time=558] And just a few days she'll be leaving to go to Chicago to finish the album and Toby Foster
[time=564] will be producing it.
[time=565] We're so excited for her and for the beginning of this ministry that God has given to her.
[time=570] And today she's going to sing one of the songs from the album with the soundtrack that was
[time=576] recorded in London.
[time=577] I know that you'll appreciate very much the ministry of Star Narwhald if she sings for us now.
[time=582] In this quiet hour overcome with emotion at what I've been given just because I asked
[time=612] how can I quiet tell you what I feel for my Jesus and all that he's done for me just
[time=630] because I asked I can't help seeing I feel I'm bursting and I can't keep it to myself
[time=657] for his holy spirit he's moving in me he has plans me and made me new for his love has
[time=684] bound me that no strength can sever he will leave me just because I asked I can't help
[time=709] my heart is bursting and I can't keep it to myself for his holy spirit he's moving in
[time=737] me he has planned me and made me new he's made me new for his love has bound me that no
[time=760] strength can sever he will leave me just because I am
[time=790] so much for joining us on the Bible hour today and especially for giving us the opportunity
[time=797] to step aside from our regular service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and express
[time=803] our appreciation to you who are watching at home for your faithfulness and being a part of our television audience I want to express a special word of appreciation to our many Founders Club members who each week and each month pray and systematically give so that
[time=819] this television program is available to the many people who depend upon it we have many new Founders Club members and these days Donna that have just really joined us in the last few weeks and have just begun to be a part of the support group it's exciting to see so many families involved in helping to get the word out to the homes of this area certainly
[time=839] isn't it would be great if we could share with you the response that we get from shut ins and folks who are in the hospital who really this is their only means of hearing the word of God each week and I think that you especially as Founders Club members could catch a glimpse
[time=854] of what's happening through the broadcast that it would really bless your heart I really believe with all of my heart Donna that when the Lord rewards those who have been faithful in proclaiming the word of God that there will be a way in which he distributes the reward among all of those who have had a part both in preaching and making the preaching possible during this time when we're visiting with you at home it gives us the privilege of sharing with you some items of literature that we have real joy in supplying to your home and
[time=885] this month we're talking about a very special tool called the four gospels arranged as a single narrative Donna why don't you share with them what's unique about this exciting little booklet this book arranges as a single narrative the different portions of the four
[time=901] gospels so if you're studying a passage for instance on the life of Christ and you want
[time=908] to know what the other passages of scriptures say about that in the gospels they're all put their right together so you don't have to turn from Matthew to John to Mark to Luke they're all right there together on that particular passage of scripture this week a lady called our office and said she wanted to have a copy of this immediately because she was conducting a home Bible study and they were going to study the gospels together and she was going to be teaching and she just had to have this tool because she knew it would be so helpful to her and we've had that same kind of response from everyone who has received this this week Donna when I was in Washington I had the privilege of meeting the man who put this together Chester Wilkins and had a chance to talk with him about how God encouraged him to do this to be of help to people all over the country and I shared with him that we had supplied many copies of this to folks who'd written in and he was very excited about that.
[time=959] If you would like to have your copy of the four gospels arranged as a single narrative all you need to do is pick up your phone and call our toll free number that number is 1-800-247-2160
[time=974] ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like the booklet on the four gospels that free number once again is 1-800-247-2160
[time=987] and we want to encourage you to continue calling if the lines are busy obviously you can understand
[time=993] that the great amount of telephone traffic will be during this particular hour when our telecast is seen so if your phone doesn't get through if you can get through to the 800 number
[time=1004] just wait for a little bit and call again the operators are on duty night and day to receive your calls and as soon as they receive your call they'll take down your information and we'll send your booklet to you this week and we appreciate so much the privilege of extending the ministry of the Bible Hour into your home in this exciting way.
[time=1022] Let me encourage you also that if you haven't written to us recently you ought to do so.
[time=1027] It's not only the Founders Club members who help keep the Bible Hour alive and on the air it is also the many people who as God impresses upon them our need sit down and write
[time=1038] to us in closing a generous gift to make the Bible Hour possible on a continuing basis
[time=1044] and I think I'm excited about the free telephone but I'm also very excited about the letters
[time=1050] we receive.
[time=1051] Donna how do they get in touch with us through the mail?
[time=1054] All you do is write to Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana and
[time=1064] the zip code is 46815 that post office box again is 15250 Fort Wayne.
[time=1074] If you are going to write experience teaches me that the best time to do it is immediately
[time=1080] following the telecast today get your paper and pencil ready write down the address on the outside of the envelope and then sit down and write us a letter and do it today while it's fresh in your mind.
[time=1091] We appreciate so many of you who stand with us and whatever you can do to help make sure that the Bible Hour continues in your area is greatly appreciated.
[time=1100] If you want the free literature that we're offering today just call 1-800-247-2160 the
[time=1106] telephone number is free the book is free and we hope that you will ask for it today so
[time=1112] that you can have it to use in your own personal Bible study.
[time=1116] Now in just a few moments I'm going to be opening the Bible and sharing a message from the Word of God on the subject why does so many churches fail?
[time=1125] I'm not talking here about churches that don't preach the Bible necessarily but even churches that believe the book and teach the scriptures and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and his death upon the cross yet many of them seem to be failing.
[time=1140] What is the reason for that?
[time=1141] I think we have some good information to share with you from the New Testament and I hope you'll stay with us so that we can share it with you.
[time=1150] Shall we turn in our hymnals now to hymn number 570 and sing just one stanza of a beautiful
[time=1158] old hymn be still my soul the Lord is on thy side I'd like you to sing the second stanza
[time=1165] it's filled with meaning think of it as we stand together and sing this song the second
[time=1172] stanza.
[time=1202] Sing this song the cry that lies.
[time=1209] Be still my soul the way that means to learn is the way to learn the way to learn.
[time=1234] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1238] There are so many things in the life of a Christian that clamor for his attention and for his love I trust your prayer will be the very same prayer of Dave Miller as he sings
[time=1251] the song I give them all to Jesus.
[time=1271] You said by spirit free.
[time=1299] Name down and rescue me if there is more I can give show me what it is Lord I want to
[time=1316] give it to thee I give my lies to thee I give my
[time=1343] lies to thee I'll unto thee a Lord cause you gave your life to me you set my spirit
[time=1372] free came down and rescued me if there is more I can give show me what it is Lord I
[time=1394] want to give it to thee show me what it is Lord I want to give it to thee
[time=1416] thank you David you know it is a wonderful thing to be able to give back to the Lord
[time=1441] he could have ordered it otherwise he doesn't need our money the one who owns the cattle
[time=1448] on a thousand hills and the wealth in every mine has more than enough to do what he needs done yet he's given us the privilege of giving back to him and it's a wonderful reminder
[time=1459] that we've had musically that David has shared with us of course the reason why we're able to do that is because we've been redeemed and we're new creatures in the Lord Jesus Christ an old hymn reminds us of that truth Jesus paid it all all to him IO listen to the refreshing
[time=1477] new arrangement of that hymn by the black hawk singers just before the message of the morning
[time=1499] I pray indeed is my child of weakness watch and pray I knew me I know you know Jesus made it all
[time=1526] to him I know sin had left the crimson sand we lost in white as snow and wave me in the
[time=1556] morning for the throne I said Jesus died my soul to say my name shall still be healed Jesus paid it all
[time=1584] out of him I know sin had left the crimson sand we lost in white as snow
[time=1627] in white as snow
[time=1643] thank you black hawk singers for that good number take your bibles now and let's turn together to
[time=1651] the book of second Corinthians and the eighth chapter second Corinthians chapter 8 and I want
[time=1658] to read for our edification this morning the seventh verse and you'll want to keep your bibles
[time=1664] open to the eighth and ninth chapter of second Corinthians for our study together today second
[time=1670] Corinthians chapter 8 verse 7 may we read it out loud together all of us here in the auditorium
[time=1679] with our bibles open reading aloud together second Corinthians chapter 8 verse 7 therefore
[time=1687] as ye abound in everything in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love
[time=1696] to us see that ye abound in this grace also shall we pray our father we are grateful that we may
[time=1708] come to the word of God for the answer to our questions that we may know what you would have us
[time=1715] to do in every individual situation we move about the country and see many how to do it magazines
[time=1726] and books and courses and tapes available there's always someone lord who wants to tell us
[time=1733] some new way to do it sometimes if we're not careful we can get lost in the sea of uncertainty that
[time=1743] pervades on every side with the human answers that are thrown out to those who would accept them
[time=1750] we come back to the solid rock foundation of thy word it has the truth thy word is truth
[time=1756] and we may know the answer you would have for us to any question and we're grateful for that
[time=1763] teaches from thy word together we pray today in Jesus name amen 876 evangelical churches went out of
[time=1774] business last year that means that financially they collapsed declaring bankruptcy or just being
[time=1783] dissolved how is it that God's people working together in the body of Christ locally assembled
[time=1792] in what we call a New Testament church could ever come to such dire straights that they would have
[time=1799] to go financially out of business well there are many who have answers for us in this day and age
[time=1807] I shall never forget a short time after becoming pastor of this church sitting in the confectioners section of a local drugstore drinking a cup of coffee when a woman sat down next to me
[time=1819] and asked me what I did I told her that I was a pastor of a local church and she asked me something
[time=1826] about it at that particular time we had just started to grow and God was blessing we were in midst of beginning plans for our first building and then she began to ask me about our pledge
[time=1838] program and I said well we don't have any she says you mean you don't have signed pledges for the
[time=1845] regular income of your local church I said no man we don't she said well how in the world do you stay in business well God's people taught from God's word give God's money back to him
[time=1856] and we just keep growing she said that's the most outlandish thing I ever heard in my life
[time=1862] she's I never heard I don't think there's another church in the world it doesn't like that oh I said yes there are there many churches that do it like that the churches that I know of that believe and teach the word of God and she began to tell me then about all of their auctions and
[time=1876] suppers and car washes and everything they did just to stay in business and I had the joy of
[time=1882] sharing with her from the word of God that God's work has to be done in God's way and that we don't
[time=1888] need to go into auctions and bingo parties and all of the other things that are going on today to
[time=1894] keep the church afloat if we'll just come back to God's word what does God have to say about how
[time=1900] the church should be sustained in its giving and what can we learn as a church body and as individuals
[time=1908] that would keep us from ever degenerating to such a low level of subsistence I believe it's all
[time=1915] right here in these two chapters and for some of you who have been committed to stewardship since you became Christians and have been giving faithfully to your local church and our following God's
[time=1926] program for giving in your own life these are just underlines in your life to underscore what you
[time=1932] already believe and for some of you who are new babes in Christ it's new teaching and new truth that God will use to bring a real sense of perspective to your life and for some of you who are backslidden
[time=1944] Christians who used to do it the way it should be done and if forgotten that that's where the joy and blessing is it'll be a means that God will use to bring you back into the center place of his
[time=1955] will now the book of second Corinthians written to the church at Corinth in this particular section
[time=1961] is a letter that Paul addressed to the Corinthian church concerning the subject of the collection a
[time=1967] collection that was being received for the poor saints in Jerusalem earlier in his letters to
[time=1973] the Corinthian church he had communicated to them about this special offering and now in this second epistle he re-addresses himself to the subject and reminds them again of the salient principles of
[time=1985] Christian stewardship that are so prevalent in the word of God first of all he tells them in
[time=1991] principal form in the first two verses of second Corinthians eight that the giving of the Christian
[time=1998] is to be that which embodies the principle of sacrifice notice what he says he says more over
[time=2004] brethren we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia how that in
[time=2012] a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches
[time=2021] of their liberality in my Bible I have underlined these words of a great trial of affliction
[time=2028] their deep poverty the situation in the Macedonian churches was one of great difficulty
[time=2035] of great trial of deep poverty they were not rich people they did not have much of the world's
[time=2042] goods but Paul used the Macedonian church as an illustration of sacrificial giving because in the
[time=2049] midst of stress they followed the principles of sacrificial giving and God blessed them
[time=2055] and they have been held up high is an example for giving since the day the Bible was written one of the great principles of stewardship that should be operative in the life of every Christian
[time=2066] is this that when we give we come to the threshold of sacrifice in our life and we give in a sacrificial
[time=2074] spirit now from the humanist standpoint from the viewpoint of the world it is natural for the
[time=2082] human nature to resist giving sacrificially even to causes which could be considered noble
[time=2089] it is not within human nature to give to noble causes even when we are unbelievers even when
[time=2096] we have much of this world's goods this past week one of the most wealthy men in the world died and we will be reading in these next days about all of those things which he gave during
[time=2107] the time of his life hold like during the time of his life and we will study together in the newspapers the many good things he accomplished with his money and yet if we were to examine it and if we were to examine the lives of all philanthropers we would learn quickly that they gave out of their abundance and they did not give out of their poverty and out of their
[time=2128] stress sometimes I talk to Christians who say if I just had more I would give more but you see the
[time=2135] principle of sacrifice is equal for everyone in every situation when we give out of a sacrificial
[time=2142] spirit we are giving God's way the principle of sacrifice in giving is illustrated every place in
[time=2149] the Bible some of you are familiar with the story recorded in the 12th chapter of the book of Mark of the woman who gave two mites to the Lord it doesn't sound like much and it really isn't much
[time=2160] and yet it was all she had and it's interesting as you study that passage of Scripture that in one in the same context God commends this woman who gave so little and he condemns the Pharisees who
[time=2172] gave so much why did he do that he did it so that men and women would understand everywhere that one
[time=2178] of the God-given principles for giving is that in our giving there needs to be a principle a spirit
[time=2186] of sacrifice I remember reading some years ago a statement that has probably done more to motivate
[time=2192] me in my own personal life from the standpoint of giving than any other statement I've ever read I
[time=2198] hope you will write it down and etch it upon your heart someone said it and this is what they said it is not sacrifice to give up what I cannot keep that I might gain what I cannot lose
[time=2211] isn't that interesting it is not sacrifice in the truest sense of the word to give up what I can't
[time=2218] keep someday it's all going to be gone when they put me in the grave it won't do me any good it is not sacrifice for me to give up what I cannot keep to gain what I cannot lose sending my treasures
[time=2231] ahead to heaven investing in the lives of people in the lives of men and women and sending that treasure on to heaven where I will forever be aware of my investment giving must be sacrifice
[time=2243] in the ninth chapter in the seventh verse we're given some subsidiary principles to the kind of
[time=2249] sacrifice in the spirit of sacrifice that should be ours in second Corinthians nine seven it says
[time=2255] that every man is to give according as a purposes in his heart he's to give not grudgingly or of
[time=2262] necessity for God loves a cheerful giver when we give sacrificially it is important that we give
[time=2269] in the right spirit our sacrifice is to be without casualness that means it is to be purposeful
[time=2276] as he purposes in his heart our sacrifice is to be without complaint not grudgingly and our
[time=2284] sacrificial giving is to be without compulsion nor because we have to out of necessity when we
[time=2291] give to God we do it willingly lovingly cheerfully and sacrificially because we want to because God
[time=2298] puts within our heart the desire to do it there is an allegory about a soul that entered heaven and
[time=2306] according to this allegory just outside of heaven there was a huge arena and over the top of the arena in big bold words were this was this sign the court of status symbols and as the soul entered
[time=2320] into heaven he had to go through this arena as he walked through the arena he walked past the door
[time=2326] of the keeper and he saw inside the arena sleek automobiles membership cards to exclusive clubs
[time=2333] poodles silver tip canes and so forth as he went past the door he asked the keeper what is the
[time=2341] meaning of all of this and the keeper of the door said yes these were all the things that the world
[time=2347] used to impress people they are symbols of significance but they don't impress God so when people pass
[time=2358] through the gates to enter heaven we ask them to drop them all off here before they go in the gates sacrificial giving sees beyond the status symbols in the prestige things of this world and gets down
[time=2370] to where we live and gives out of a heart of love for God willingly not trying to impress the world
[time=2378] but trying our very best to love God the first principle that you find in the second book of Corinthians chapters eight and nine is the principle of sacrificial giving during recent days as we
[time=2389] have gone through the together we build program in this church many of us have come to grips with that principle as never before god bless every one of you who are doing your part in sacrificial
[time=2400] giving through the ministry of this church and its outreach and its forward progress as you
[time=2406] sacrifice god blesses and i can promise you that's true because that's what the word of god has to say but i want you to notice secondly that our giving is to be spontaneous throughout these two chapters
[time=2418] there are some wonderful truths that tell us the spirit in which we are to give it says first of
[time=2424] all in second Corinthians chapter eight and verse three that these Macedonians gave willingly of
[time=2430] themselves and then in the fourth verse of the eighth chapter there is one of the most amazing stewardship truths you'll find anywhere in the bible for here is the record of a group of people
[time=2441] who actually begged to be included in the offering who actually pled oh please let us have a part
[time=2449] in giving i wondered as i read this again what it would be like if everyone sat on the edge of their
[time=2456] seat in anticipation of the morning offering and if each week you would come out the door and say
[time=2462] to me oh pastor what a joy it was to be in church today so that i could give oh pastor what a willing
[time=2469] what a wonderful privilege it is to be here to participate in the offering now i know that many of you feel that way but i'll have to honestly say that in my ten years here no one has ever said that to me i'm sure that many will at the end of the service today but no one up to this point
[time=2484] has ever said that but listen to the fourth verse will you paul said the Macedonians begged us
[time=2490] with much in treaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of ministering
[time=2498] to the saints you know that's the spirit that ought to be in our hearts when we give oh god thank you
[time=2504] for letting me give let me have a part in the ministry lord i want to give it's in my heart to
[time=2510] do it and i'm excited about doing it how that transforms our whole spirit from the spirit of
[time=2517] being obligated or being pressured or being led to feel that we must do it god wants us to do it
[time=2524] willingly it is to be with a spontaneous spirit and then of course in the seventh verse that we
[time=2530] read just a few moments ago it says that we are to give willingly out of a spontaneous response to
[time=2537] god i believe that this particular principle more than any other principle in the bible elevates new testament giving far above anything that's ever given in the old testament the reason i
[time=2549] don't preach on the old testament tithe as law for today is because i believe it's a principle far beneath the new testament ethic forgiving if you're giving ten percent as a part of the law and because
[time=2560] you feel obligated to do it you would be better to give nine percent spontaneously the new testament
[time=2567] looks not only at our gift but at the spirit and the willing and spontaneous wonderful feeling that
[time=2573] we have within us as we give because we want to second Corinthians nine verse seven sums it all
[time=2581] up again with these three phrases not grudgingly not of necessity but cheerfully we are to give
[time=2589] spontaneously you know there are three motivational levels according to those who understand these
[time=2595] things by which we do anything on a volunteer basis sometimes we do it because somebody says we
[time=2603] must we really don't have to but they tell us we must this becomes law to us and and so we
[time=2609] don't have freedom we feel we must do it without choice and then there's a second level of motivation
[time=2616] in giving and that is the idea that we ought to this is sort of moral obligation that is brought upon us and we feel like though it's not as strong as we must we feel moral responsibility we feel
[time=2628] compulsion to do it but all the third level is the greatest and that is we want to we want to give
[time=2637] this is grace and freedom and love and spontaneity and all that god wants from us as we respond to him
[time=2643] god does not want his creatures sitting in straight rows on sunday plopping a specific gift in the
[time=2651] offering plate because they have to or they feel obligated to he wants loving responders to his
[time=2657] grace who do all they can to say that they love him through their life and through their gifts and who look forward to the privilege of tangibly expressing to him their love as they give of their
[time=2668] gifts to the lord and anything we do in the church god help us anything we do that causes
[time=2676] people to feel they must that causes people to feel they have to that causes people to feel it's an obligation takes away from the joy that ought to be ours in our Christian faith as we respond back to
[time=2688] god our giving our stewardship is to be sacrificial and to be spontaneous but thirdly i want you to
[time=2699] notice that our stewardship is to be selfless it is a wonderful thing that we find in the fourth verse of this second chapter of second this eighth chapter of second Corinthians for in the fourth
[time=2710] verse we read these words be teaching us with much in treaty that we would receive the gift and take
[time=2716] upon us the fellowship now notice this phrase of the ministering to the saints what is giving
[time=2722] giving is caring not just worshiping god but giving is caring about other people we had the privilege
[time=2729] last sunday night of seeing a most provocative film that illustrated the the role and responsibility
[time=2736] of the christian church as a role of a hospital ministering to men and women who are dying with
[time=2742] a dread disease and though that is a very graphic illustration let me remind you that that's exactly
[time=2748] what god has called us to do he has called us as a church to band together with our lives and our talents and our service and our resources to reach out to minister not only to the saints as is here
[time=2760] illustrated but to those who need to hear of the Lord Jesus Christ you see when we give we take part
[time=2767] of ourselves and we give it away so giving in the very deepest sense of the word is selfless it is
[time=2775] taking my eyes off of myself and looking to other people and you know something i'm just like all
[time=2781] the rest of you who are who are born into this human race with the old nature and all of the evil bent that's a part of it i regularly need to be reminded of the importance of doing that
[time=2792] are we not all even as christians very self-centered very self-motivated people apart from the grace
[time=2799] of god one of the great things that giving does for us is it helps us to take our eyes off of our self the things we would buy with the money the things we would do with the money the places we would go with the money the clothes we would buy with the money and it causes us to look out to the needs of others and selflessly share i've loved to read the biographies of some of god's great people
[time=2820] and one of the great missionary statements states statesman from england was a man by the name of
[time=2826] ct stud not only was he a great missionary but earlier in his life he was one of england's greatest
[time=2832] athletes during the 1800s he was involved as a world champion cricket player which is a very
[time=2838] big sport in england after his parents died he discovered to his amazement
[time=2844] that he had become a very wealthy man his father left him 29 000 pounds english pounds which is
[time=2853] equivalent to something like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in our money and for that time that was a small fortune even as it is to most of us today when ct stud got the money he had been
[time=2867] preparing for the mission field and after he received the money he prayed diligently that god would help him to use it properly and one day he wrote i do not want this money to clutter up
[time=2879] my life and so he began to give it away he gave five thousand pounds to hudson taylor another missionary he gave five thousand pounds to william booth who some of you will know as a as a
[time=2891] historical figure in the salvation army ministry he gave another five thousand pounds to dl moody
[time=2897] and moody was going to use it to start a ministry in india but that didn't materialize and so he used it as the seed money to start moody bible institute and then he had a little bit left that he spread out to some other places and some other ministries and finally he had three thousand four
[time=2912] hundred pounds left and on the day of his marriage he gave it to his wife as a gift and after she saw what he had done she said you know in the new testament the lord told the rich young ruler to go and give all that he had to the poor and she said i want to do that so she
[time=2928] sent the the last three thousand four hundred pounds and she gave it to hudson taylor and then ct stud wrote these words he said now we are in the proud position of being able to say
[time=2941] silver and gold have we none and ct stud went to the mission field of africa he has looked upon as
[time=2949] one of the great missionaries who ever served god and what can we say about his investment in the
[time=2955] ministries to whom he gave the money the moody bible institute stands today as one of the great
[time=2961] institutions of biblical learning and literally has invested and reinvested ct studs money around
[time=2968] the world in the lives of young people in the ministry of radio and in the ministry of literature and untold other ministries hudson taylor opened up a whole new field for god and on and on who was
[time=2981] the winner in the giving up and the selfless giving of his money ct stud will spend eternity
[time=2987] clipping the coupons off of his lifetime investment he'll be talking to people throughout the ages
[time=2993] that came to christ because of his selfless giving and while some people who hoarded their money during
[time=2999] this lifetime walk around the kingdom with their head down because they know they're not going to see anything that they sent on ahead what a joyous experience will be his as forever and ever he is
[time=3011] allowed to remember the investment that he made for eternity one of the joys of spiritual giving
[time=3017] men and women is that it's selfless it takes our eyes off of ourselves and it looks to others every time i give to this church every time i put any money in the plate to this church it ought to
[time=3028] come to my mind that that's an investment in souls every time people walk down these aisles to make decisions for jesus christ that's a result of the money together we have given so that others might
[time=3039] hear of the wonderful grace of the lord jesus christ giving should be selfless then i want to share
[time=3048] with you lastly that our giving ought to be systematic it's an interesting thing we find in the sixth verse of this chapter paul writes in so much that we be sought titus that as he had begun so he would
[time=3060] also finish in you the same grace what does that mean paul said that titus had been sent earlier to
[time=3066] instruct the quarantines concerning giving sometimes i hear my brethren in the ministry tell me that
[time=3073] we ought not ever speak on giving we ought to just open up shop take the offering and let happen what will happen well you know giving is a grace to be learned it's a truth to be taught it's a discipline to be understood and i don't know what i know about giving today because i learned
[time=3088] it through the principle of osmosis i know what i know about giving today because somebody taught me from the word of god what god has to say about spiritual stewardship inevitably when we have
[time=3099] testimonies during stewardship month here individuals will stay up stand up and say you know i came to this church and during stewardship month i heard the teaching on stewardship and i began to give and god's blessed my life how we impoverished the church when we don't teach what god has to say
[time=3115] about spiritual giving how we rob god's people from the blessing of being in the center of his will
[time=3121] when we don't teach him what he has to say titus was a stewardship speaker he went to teach the quarantines how to give and paul mentions that here is an illustration of the importance of systematic giving paul earlier wrote in the sixteenth chapter of first quarantines that every sunday on the first day of the week god's people were to lay beside them those things which they
[time=3142] were to give to god systematic regular giving i like to teach the people in our church that when
[time=3148] we give systematically five good things happen first of all when we give systematically it causes
[time=3154] us to regularly and weekly evaluate our priorities when we give systematically it causes us regularly
[time=3163] and weekly to express our love to god in a tangible way when we give weekly and systematically it
[time=3171] causes us to exemplify our faith to say by our giving that we believe in god when we give regularly
[time=3178] and systematically it causes us to examine our motives regularly why am i doing this why is it
[time=3185] that i give this money and when we give regularly and systematically it causes us to execute god's
[time=3192] will regularly you know there's a lot of things that i don't know about completely in terms of the will of god every once in a while someone asked me a question what is god's will about this well i don't have any word i have to follow the principles and use the spirit of god to direct me but i'm grateful that there are a great number of things in the bible about which there is no doubt and i
[time=3211] know for sure what god's will is for my life in the matter of giving and so when i give i am
[time=3217] executing the will of god and it's a wonderful thrill it's a wonderful feeling some of you like
[time=3223] your pastor got a statement this past week of your giving during the past year and as i looked at
[time=3229] that and i thought about the amount of money that was involved in it i didn't regret it i was filled with joy and excitement to think that god had enabled me to give that kind of money to his program
[time=3240] and to his purpose and in doing it to regularly systematically execute his will it's a thrilling
[time=3247] thing to follow the word of god and the principles of the word of god let me say to you men and women
[time=3253] as long as we follow these principles our church will never go bankrupt as long as we follow these principles you'll never drive by state street and see the windows boarded up on black hawk baptist church gone out of business because god's way always works and when we give god's way and all of us
[time=3270] recognize the individual personal responsibility that we have as members of the body to be obedient
[time=3276] to the word god's program will go forward and it will not be abated because of the lack of funds i
[time=3283] like the famous story told by ruskin illustrating the difference in our lives as it relates to
[time=3292] stewardship he said a man tried to swim to safety from a wrecked ship about his waist he had tied
[time=3300] a waistband containing 200 pounds of gold that he was trying to save from the ship's stronghold
[time=3307] as he swam to shore he was unable to make it and he refused to release the belt and as ruskin tells
[time=3320] the story he asked this provocative question he said as he sank and was drowned
[time=3326] had he the gold or had the gold him that's the difference isn't it
[time=3334] in our lives as christians do we have the money or does the money have us
[time=3342] if we clutch it and hold it and hang on to it then it has us doesn't it but if our hands are open to
[time=3348] give and to share and to minister and to be good stewards then god can have it all any of it as much of it as he wants and he also can give back to us in replenishing the supply
[time=3360] shall we pray father we thank you for your word we thank you for the wonderful principles that
[time=3369] are contained therein we thank you that as we obey these principles and as we give and as we
[time=3375] diligently apply them to our own lives and hearts you've been sharing the bible hour with pastor
