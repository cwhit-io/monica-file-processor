[time=16] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=22] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=58] >> And all God's people said, and you may be seated.
[time=73] >> A young man came into my office some time ago and he said, "Pastor Jeremiah, I have a question for you.
[time=84] I don't understand why it is that when I pray, God never seems to answer.
[time=90] I read all of these books about great answers to prayer, and yet I pray.
[time=97] And sometimes, Pastor, it seems like my words don't even get out of the room.
[time=103] Is it any use to pray?
[time=106] Should I keep on praying?
[time=108] Or am I doing something wrong that keeps God from hearing me?
[time=113] I suppose he verbalized what many Christians have felt at one time or another
[time=119] who have made a serious attempt at a ministry of prayer in their own life.
[time=124] It's interesting to understand that God's Word has some conditions for answered prayer.
[time=131] And today, as we open the Scripture, we're going to look at some of the reasons why God may not be answering your prayer when you pray.
[time=139] And I trust you'll have your Bible's handy and something to write with and a piece of paper
[time=145] so that you can write down these things from the Word of God.
[time=149] And then it's a good principle to check yourself out and see whether or not you're praying is the kind of praying that God hears.
[time=158] But that's a little bit later on in our service of worship.
[time=161] Right now, we have some exciting music.
[time=163] We're going to introduce to you, Marilyn Wong, who's going to come and sing to us a song about heaven She's going to sing to us a song about what it's like when we are finally home to be with the Lord.
[time=174] And then immediately after that, listen to the ministry of our choir as they continue that theme of future things.
[time=198] [MUSIC - 176 seconds]

[time=564] - Thank you for joining us today in this middle of the winter season for the Bible Hour Telecast.
[time=580] We're so grateful that we have the opportunity to share this service with you in your home and we know that during these particular days it's meaning a great deal to many who are not able to get out to their local assemblies because of inclement weather.
[time=594] And we're just hoping and praying that God will use this particular series of messages and this particular day's service to be a real source of encouragement in your own home.
[time=604] During this time when we step aside for a few moments to talk with you at home, we have the privilege of introducing to you some literature that we believe will be of help to you in your own personal Bible study.
[time=616] We call this program the Bible Hour and it is our purpose to emphasize and illustrate
[time=622] and every way encourage the use of the Bible in daily living.
[time=627] Donna, this book that we have been sharing over these past days has been received widely
[time=633] and I think there's some good reasons for that.
[time=636] This is really a handy little booklet as you study the four gospels and the neat feature about it
[time=645] is that the four gospels are arranged as a single narrative.
[time=649] And so as you read through the life of Christ you read through it as the events actually happened and they are all put together from Matthew through John.
[time=658] If that particular passage in Matthew has a corresponding passage in John then that is in that particular context.
[time=665] It's just such a time saving booklet because it keeps you from leafing back and forth.
[time=670] And I think one of the other features that so many have expressed to me is that it gives you more of a feeling of continuity as you read through the life of Christ.
[time=680] You get more a sense of perspective in his whole life from the beginning to the end.
[time=686] That's right and there are also some other nice little features.
[time=689] There are also in the margins he has passages that are parallel passages that you might want to refer to later.
[time=697] And also on occasion he gives you little doctrinal notes at the bottom of the page.
[time=701] The back of the book is filled with some indices that help you to find certain things in the New Testament.
[time=708] And this very helpful booklet is our special gift to you during this particular season.
[time=715] Now we have had this book offer on the air for a number of weeks and we're coming down to the end of the time when this is going to be made available.
[time=723] So if you haven't received years yet you need to be getting in touch with us as soon as possible.
[time=729] Donna why don't you give them the address where they can write if they want to receive this free book.
[time=734] If you would like your copy of the Four Gospels just write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=748] That Post Office Box again is 15250.
[time=753] During the last few weeks we have been making available to you the opportunity of contacting us through a free 800 number.
[time=762] We are not doing that today and will not be doing it in the next weeks simply because the cost of that ministry and service is so prohibitive.
[time=771] We're facing some real continuing struggles in the financial aspects of the Bible Our Television Program.
[time=778] We're doing all that we can do to cut those costs so that we can continue to make this ministry available in as many areas as possible.
[time=788] I'm going to ask that you write to me this week and as you request your copy of this free book if you haven't received years already that you consider the possibility of giving the largest possible gift you can give at this time to the Bible Our Ministry.
[time=804] In just a few days you'll be receiving a letter from my office concerning the financial need that we have during this time.
[time=812] It is our purpose as we have talked together here in our offices and prayed together.
[time=817] It is our purpose to do everything we can to cut the cost of the Bible Our Ministry to a bare minimum without affecting the ministry that it has in your own home.
[time=827] That is the actual telecast itself.
[time=830] We're doing all we can to keep this as economically feasible as possible.
[time=835] But the bottom line on it all for this ministry is that we need your help and we cannot carry this load by ourselves.
[time=842] This ministry must find the support of God's people wherever it is seen or it will not be possible for us to continue carrying the responsibility of the Bible Our in the various areas where it is now viewed.
[time=855] I'm going to ask that you sit down today and write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and when you write in close a gift as much as you're able to do at this time for the cause of Christ and for the ministry of the Bible Our in your area.
[time=877] We appreciate your prayer. We thank you for your standing with us. A special word of appreciation is extended to all of our Founders Club members who regularly support us through their gifts and through their prayers.
[time=891] But right now we need many more of you to help and I hope you will.
[time=895] And then as you get your letter in a few days, those of you who are on our mailing list, we read it carefully and prayerfully and consider the information there and ask God to work through you to help us get the gospel out to as many people as possible during these closing days.
[time=911] Now in just a few moments, I'm going to be opening the scriptures and answering this question, "Why are my prayers not answered?" If you've ever felt that, if you've ever wondered about that, if you've ever asked that, you'll want to stay with us right to the very end as we look into the Word of God and look at the reasons why prayers are not answered in the lives of Christians.
[time=935] Thank you for being a part of our program today and please enjoy the ministry of music and the fellowship in the Word of God as we continue to share with you the Bible Our today.
[time=966] Now shall we take our hymnals and turn them to hymn number nine and we'll sing together Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty hymn number nine.
[time=980] Shall we stand together now as we sing?
[time=986] Every voice together, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty hymn number nine.
[time=1000] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy Christ Almighty hymn number nine.
[time=1069] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=1075] David of old said, "The Lord will walk with me," said it in Psalm 23, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me."
[time=1091] We need not fear when we have the presence of the Lord. Ron Hackett, our tenor soloist, is going to sing for us now, a prayer entitled "Walk with Me."
[time=1106] "Walk with me, walk with me, lest my eyes no longer see all the glory of the story of your life."
[time=1135] Talk to me, talk to me like you spoke so tenderly when you talked there, when you walked there by the sea.
[time=1164] Let me follow in your footsteps, let's draw the stars of Galilee.
[time=1184] Let me learn to pray like you pray. In the garden of Gethsemane.
[time=1203] Take my hand, take my hand, teach me Lord to understand all my duty, all the duty of your life.
[time=1228] Let me follow in your footsteps, let's draw the stars of Galilee.
[time=1247] Let me learn to pray like you pray. In the garden of Gethsemane.
[time=1266] Take my hand, help me Lord to understand all my duty, all the duty of your life.
[time=1292] Teach me Lord, all the duty of your life.
[time=1322] Thank you Ron for that prayer. And now Ron is going to be joined by the other members of the Men Singers Quartet, as they share with us a song entitled "God and His Children."
[time=1349] There is nothing to compare with the fellowship they share.
[time=1358] God and His children. For their times are satisfied as they walk inside by sight. God with His children.
[time=1381] God in pleasure, God in pleasure, God in pleasure, God in pleasure, God in pleasure.
[time=1409] And in the valley deep, for when paths are rough and steep.
[time=1417] God keeps His children, sin and sorrow cannot harm, for by His Almighty arm.
[time=1433] God keeps His children, there is grace sufficient for the journey long.
[time=1448] And from deep within there comes a joyful song, and from deep within there comes a joyful song, a joyful song.
[time=1467] Satisfaction that is sweet and fulfill, at least complete. God gives His children.
[time=1482] Peace was gone and man restored and assured to His Word. God gives His children.
[time=1498] In the world our fears that will destroy. In God's will is happiness and joy.
[time=1513] In God's will is happiness and joy. Happiness and joy.
[time=1528] Thank you, Miss Singers. That's great quartet music.
[time=1536] Let's take our Bibles and turn together now to the book of James and the fourth chapter, James chapter 4.
[time=1545] Our Bibles are open to the fourth chapter of the book of James, and I want to read for our scripture lesson this morning, the first three verses of the fourth chapter.
[time=1555] James chapter 4 verses 1 through 3.
[time=1563] From whence come wars and fighting among you, come they not hear even of your lusts that war in your members.
[time=1572] You lust and you have not, you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain, you fight and war, you have not because you ask not.
[time=1581] You ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts. Shall we pray together?
[time=1592] Our Father in heaven we would ask that you would illuminate our hearts and minds as we relate this morning to this problem of unanswered prayer.
[time=1602] Help us to understand from the outset that thou art a God who has promised to hear and answer us, that if our prayers are not answered, the fault lath not with the Almighty.
[time=1614] But with those who come to Him in a wrong spirit, from a wrong perspective,
[time=1622] Lord help us to identify those things from thy holy word today about which we must be concerned as it relates to having our prayers answered.
[time=1633] Lord if there are those here under the sound of my voice in this auditorium or elsewhere where the message is being heard, who have never prayed that first prayer that God hears,
[time=1644] God be merciful to me as sinner, may even this day be a day of salvation for them as they lift their hearts to God in prayer.
[time=1653] For we pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1658] I'm sure that if we're honest, most of us at one time or another have been somewhat frustrated by the doctrine of prayer.
[time=1667] We have prayed specifically and with importunity that God would do a certain thing in our behalf.
[time=1676] And as we have watched the horizon of answered prayer, we have not seen that answer come into view.
[time=1682] We have questioned, we have continued to pray, we have intensified our prayer, and then on many occasions we have given up.
[time=1693] We have stopped praying, we have ceased to ask.
[time=1698] I want to be very careful in this message this morning that I help you to understand that God does answer prayer.
[time=1705] That His answers may not always agree with our request, but that He does answer our prayers.
[time=1713] And I think we also need to understand that when we pray, when we pray according to the Scripture and in keeping with God's Word as it directs us in prayer,
[time=1722] we may pray with confidence that God will hear and He will answer.
[time=1728] I wish it were possible for us to turn to one central passage of Scripture, which would give to us in a circumscribed manner, all of the various hindrances and reasons for unanswered prayer.
[time=1743] But that's not possible. We must turn to some different passages.
[time=1747] And today I'm going to ask you to turn with me to some other passages of Scripture, and I'm going to very quickly mention some passages and quote or read those passages.
[time=1757] And I hope you'll write them down and look at them later.
[time=1761] For I believe that the six reasons for unanswered prayer that I want to share with you today basically encompass all of those areas of prayer and all of those areas of hindrance to prayer that are found within the Word of God.
[time=1776] And the nuances of each of these six reasons as we look at them through our own personal experience will identify perhaps in our hearts and in our lives some of the things that are not where they ought to be so that God may deal with us in answering our prayers.
[time=1793] Now the first and foremost and most obviously recognized reason for unanswered prayer is sin in our lives.
[time=1802] Over and over again in the Word of God we are reminded that God will not hear us and answer our prayers if there is unconfessed sin in our own hearts and in our lives.
[time=1813] He says this so many times I can only quote a few of the verses that give to us this truth.
[time=1819] Psalm 66 18 says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.
[time=1830] That means if I acknowledge that there is sin in my life if I regard it if I see it and I don't deal with it I don't confess it I might as well not pray because God won't hear me.
[time=1842] This is also given to us in the book of Proverbs chapter 15 verse 29 the Lord is far from the wicked said the writer of Proverbs but he hearth the prayer of the righteous.
[time=1856] It is found in Proverbs chapter 28 in verse 9 he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be an abomination.
[time=1866] The writer of Proverbs said if you listen to the Word of God and God speaks to you and you disobey and you're not obedient you might as well not prayer your prayer is an abomination to God.
[time=1878] Isaiah chapter 1 and verse 15 the prophet Isaiah graphically paints this picture and with prophetic insight he says and when you spread forth your hands which is the Old Testament way of praying when you spread forth your hands
[time=1894] I will hide my eyes from you.
[time=1899] Yea when you make many prayers I will not hear.
[time=1904] Your hands are full of blood.
[time=1908] God says you're lifting up the hands of murder you're lifting up the hands of disobedience and rebellion and when you hold up these hands in the manner of your prayer I'm going to hide my eyes from you I won't listen to you because you're not holding up a holy life you're living in sin and I won't hear it.
[time=1923] And I won't hear it and I won't answer it.
[time=1928] In the New Testament in the book of John chapter 9 and verse 31 we read now we know that God heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth his will him he heareth.
[time=1943] 1 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 8 says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.
[time=1957] If you have your Bibles turn with me to the Old Testament book of Ezekiel and let me point out to you one specific sin that God says he will not look beyond in terms of answering our prayer.
[time=1968] We're going to look at some others but here is an Old Testament illustration of this truth Ezekiel chapter 14 verses 1 through 3.
[time=1976] Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me and sat before me and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face.
[time=1992] Should I be inquired at all by them?
[time=1998] Therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the Lord God every man of the house of Israel that seteth up his idols in his heart and put it the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet.
[time=2011] I the Lord will answer him that come with according to the multitude of his idols. God says when you have an idol in your heart, when you are lifting up something in front of God and in God's place.
[time=2023] He asked the rhetorical question should I listen to such as one in that?
[time=2027] Should I hear the prayers of one who worships at the throne of another God while he is harboring sin in his own life?
[time=2034] Should I be listening to his prayers? And the obvious answer is no. A thousand times no.
[time=2041] Probably heard of the old farmer who came to prayer meeting one night and as he came to pray at the altar he remembered that he had an ox that belonged to his neighbor that had wandered across the fence line and he had just sort of confiscated it for his own use and made it one of his own.
[time=2059] And as he was on his knees praying suddenly dawned on him that there was no use for him to pray as long as that ox was in his stall and he had to go home and get that right before he could come back and pray.
[time=2072] I think one of the reasons why our prayers don't go very far people is because we are harboring known sin in our lives.
[time=2079] We know it. We recognize that it's not a matter of it being some secret thing that God has not revealed to us yet.
[time=2086] But we can look down into our hearts and know their sin there that we ought to deal with and we're not dealing with it.
[time=2092] We see it. We're regarding it. And the simple truth of the scripture is this.
[time=2096] If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me. He won't answer my prayer.
[time=2103] How many families are there where the husband prays earnestly for his children to be saved? Oh, God saved my children.
[time=2113] How many situations are there in homes where the wife prays that her husband will be saved? Oh, God saved my wife.
[time=2120] And all the time those individuals are harboring sin in their lives, known sin that they ought to deal with and they're not dealing with it.
[time=2126] And then they don't understand why God won't answer their prayer.
[time=2129] Now, that's not my statement. That's not what I've conjured up. That's what God says.
[time=2134] God says if I have sin in my life, I might as well not pray because he won't answer my prayer.
[time=2139] You say, Pastor, does that mean that if I have a sin in my life that I don't know about?
[time=2144] And it's not been revealed to me that it's sin and it's there and it might be there and I not even know about it that God won't hear me.
[time=2150] That's not what the verse says. The verse says if I regard sin in my life, if I see that sin and I know it's there and I don't deal with it,
[time=2158] God won't answer my prayer. Reason number one, for unanswered prayer is this, sin in our lives.
[time=2166] The second reason why God doesn't answer prayer is because of skepticism in our hearts.
[time=2171] You'll find this in James chapter 1 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2175] James 1, 6 and 7.
[time=2178] But when you pray, ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the seed driven with the wind and tossed.
[time=2187] Now listen to verse 7. Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.
[time=2195] That passage of Scripture says that when we pray and we ask God for something and we commit something to him, we are to ask in faith.
[time=2205] You know there's a very interesting passage in the gospels recorded both in Matthew and in Mark that talks about the kind of faith that it takes to move a mountain.
[time=2214] And there's so much that's being said about that these days in the age of the quote unquote miraculous about the moving of mountains.
[time=2222] What that verse really says is if God says to you, I want that mountain removed and you know that it's the will of God to remove it and you pray that it be removed, God will honor that prayer.
[time=2232] Now if he hasn't told you that he wants the mountain removed, you better not be praying it because you're to pray in the will of God, but there's a phrase in that verse that's key.
[time=2241] Oftentimes overlooked, not contained in Matthew's account, but in Mark's account it says this.
[time=2247] Therefore I say unto you whatever things you desire when ye pray, believe that ye have them and ye shall have them.
[time=2257] And then verse 23 adds this.
[time=2260] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart.
[time=2272] But shall believe that those things which he saith come to pass, he shall have whatever he asks.
[time=2280] One of the reasons why we don't have our prayers answered people is because we really don't believe down in our hearts that God's capable of answering prayer.
[time=2287] We pray and then what is the next thing we do?
[time=2291] We move into operation to answer that prayer ourselves.
[time=2294] Lord hear my prayer, but I don't really believe you hear it and I don't really believe you answer it so I'm going to answer it myself.
[time=2303] And the scripture says that such a man is unstable, he's double-minded, he's like the wave of the sea tossed to and fro.
[time=2310] One of the characteristics of a wave of the sea is it doesn't stay in one place very long, moves back and forth.
[time=2316] And some Christians I know are like the folks who cast their burden upon the Lord and he has it five minutes and they've got it right back themselves.
[time=2323] Lord here's my burden, but Lord I want it myself.
[time=2327] They're unstable, they're double-minded.
[time=2329] On the one hand they believe God is necessary for their problem, on the other hand they want to hold on to it themselves.
[time=2336] The writer of Hebrews reminds us that without faith it is impossible to please God.
[time=2342] The kind of petitioner that James is talking about here in the first chapter is the kind of person who commits a problem to God and then resumes responsibility for it himself.
[time=2352] I like the song we sing on occasion, take your burden to the Lord and what's the rest of it class, and leave it there.
[time=2365] The Bible tells us that we cannot pray double-mindedly.
[time=2369] The Old Testament writer of Psalms, my favorite Psalms, Psalm 37, I'd like to read it the way I read it, commit and leave committed your way to the Lord.
[time=2380] Trust and keep on trusting also in him and he will do it. Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him.
[time=2389] Commit and keep on committing.
[time=2391] Trust and keep on trusting.
[time=2393] When you bring something to the Lord, believe that he's going to deal with it and have faith that he will deal with it and don't just come and believe in prayer.
[time=2401] There isn't anything in the Bible that says we're to believe in prayer, we're to believe in God who answers prayer.
[time=2407] And we're to commit our way to him and then trust him to care for the need.
[time=2412] One of the reasons why we don't have our prayers answered so many times is because of skepticism in our hearts.
[time=2418] God won't hear the prayer of someone who says, Lord, are you there?
[time=2424] Lord, I've got a problem. You probably don't understand it, but I'm going to share it with you.
[time=2428] There's probably not anything you can do about it, Lord, but here's what it is.
[time=2433] And Lord, I'll do my part. I'm going to do all of these things.
[time=2437] Lord, if you could just give me a little shove and just a little help, that's not believing prayer.
[time=2442] We're to give God our problems.
[time=2445] Lock, stock, barrel.
[time=2449] Another reason why our prayers are not answered is because of selfishness in our motives.
[time=2454] James chapter 4 and verse 3 mentions this, it says, "You have not because you ask not,
[time=2463] and you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts."
[time=2472] The word amiss is an Old Testament or a New Testament word which means evil, base, low level.
[time=2479] It is the Greek word kakas. It means bad. You ask in a bad way.
[time=2484] You ask for a wrong reason on a low level, and you ask that you might consume it upon your own pleasures.
[time=2491] 1 John chapter 5 and verse 14 puts this verse in a positive way.
[time=2496] It says this, "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us."
[time=2505] Isn't it interesting that in all of the instruction on prayer that we have in the New Testament, the right priorities and the right motives are always emphasized in the Lord's prayer, for instance.
[time=2515] The Lord's prayer does not start out with those things that affect us directly, but the Lord's prayer starts out with hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done.
[time=2526] The Lord is uppermost in the thoughts of the Lord's prayer.
[time=2531] In Luke chapter 12 and verse 13 we read about a man who came to Jesus and he said, "Master, speak to my brethren that he divide the inheritance with me."
[time=2542] That reminds me of a lot of our prayers. "Lord, I'm coming to pray to you today because somebody told me that if I get in with you, things are going to be better for me,
[time=2550] and I want what you have so that I can have what I need." Lord is looked upon by some Christians as a big sugar daddy up in heaven,
[time=2560] who dispenses all of the things they want to consume upon their own lusts, and the Bible says a man who comes with that motive will never get his prayer answered.
[time=2568] And you know it's kind of insidious how this works even in our lives as Christians, isn't it?
[time=2574] Sometimes women, you can pray for your unsaved husband, not because you're concerned for his eternal destiny, but because you know that if he got saved, things would go better for you at home.
[time=2584] That's a selfish motive, isn't it?
[time=2587] Sometimes you can pray for your unsaved kids because you're not necessarily concerned about their eternal destiny
[time=2593] or what Christ will mean to them, but because their situation is an embarrassment to you.
[time=2599] Sometimes you can pray for health, not so that you can use that health to serve God better, but so that you can use that good health to live a riotous kind of life that is displeasing to God.
[time=2611] Sometimes you can pray for wealth, not so that you might be able to give more to help others, to give more to get the gospel out, but so that you can have more of this world's goods to consume upon yourself.
[time=2622] That kind of praying God won't hear.
[time=2626] The prayer recorded of an old man in a church went something like this.
[time=2629] "Lord, bless us too," and that will do.
[time=2633] Or another man who prayed, "Lord, bless only me," that's as far as I can see.
[time=2638] That's the way a lot of us pray.
[time=2640] Give me, give me, give me.
[time=2643] And we don't even want it for the right reason.
[time=2647] The word lust in this passage of Scripture is the word from which we get our English word "headonistic."
[time=2653] It is the Greek word "headonai." It means pleasure, flesh.
[time=2659] And the word consume here is a word which means to waste in a wanton way, to destroy, to do something with it so that it's never usable again.
[time=2668] And God says there are some people, Christians, who come to Him in prayer and they say, "Lord, I want this."
[time=2674] And in their hearts the reason they want it is so that they can waste it on their own pleasures and on their own life and on their own motives.
[time=2684] God will not hear that kind of a selfish prayer.
[time=2690] There's a small Christian sect of exclusive temperamental Christians were holding a convention one time.
[time=2698] On the outside of the auditorium there was a big motto displayed that said, "Jesus only."
[time=2705] And this very exclusive and self-centered sect of people had chosen that as their fictitious motto for the conference.
[time=2716] But during the night there was a great windstorm and the windstorm came along and blew away the first three letters of Jesus and everybody who went by saw the words "us only" on the outside of the building.
[time=2733] And a commentator wrote about it and said that probably was more appropriate than that which was written there first.
[time=2740] I wonder how many of our prayers men and women are related to us only.
[time=2745] How many of our prayers are prayed that we might consume the answer to that prayer upon our own lusts?
[time=2757] Someone is written and so my prayers he hears and heeds, mindful of all my daily needs, gracious, most gracious to in this he denies me when I ask amiss.
[time=2772] I guess I've lived long enough even as a pastor to be thankful for all the prayers God has answered that I've prayed because they've been selfish, base, low-level prayers.
[time=2784] And had I gotten what I wanted I would have used it to deepen the breach between myself and my God.
[time=2793] God does not answer our prayers when they're sin in our life, he does not answer our prayers.
[time=2798] When there is selfishness in our motives he does not answer our prayers when there is skepticism in our hearts.
[time=2805] But thirdly, and I must cover this quickly, God does not answer our prayers when there is strife with other people.
[time=2813] A very interesting passage of Scripture recorded in Matthew 11 says this, Matthew 11, 25, and when ye stand praying, forgive.
[time=2822] If ye have anything against any, that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive your trespasses.
[time=2832] Another passage says if you've brought your gift to the altar and you present it to God and you remember that somebody has awed against you, leave your gift at the altar and go get your problem straightened out, then come back and pray.
[time=2846] If you sense in your heart that you have an unforgiving spirit towards some other brother, perhaps even someone who's not a Christian, and you come to God to pray,
[time=2854] how is God going to hear your prayer when you're harboring in your heart a bitterness toward another person?
[time=2860] Mark says when you stand praying if you have bitterness in your heart get that straightened out and then come back to this whole matter of prayer.
[time=2872] May I illustrate again that it is quite possible for us to be praying for something we dearly want with all of our hearts.
[time=2880] It's something we know God would be honored about.
[time=2882] We don't understand why it is that he hasn't answered our prayer, but when we read this verse, do we reckon in our own hearts as to whether or not there is a spirit of bitterness within us toward any other person?
[time=2893] And if that spirit is there, if there's unforgiveness in our hearts toward any person, God will not hear our prayer and answer it.
[time=2900] That's what the Scripture says.
[time=2902] And that's why someone has written, "He prayeth best, who loveeth best, all things both great and small, for the great God who loves us, he makes and loves all."
[time=2914] How can you expect God to hear a prayer that you pray to him when you have bitterness against someone else that God loves equally well as he loves you?
[time=2924] Why that's preposterous. God won't do that. I'm sure that in a congregation of this size, there are some people sitting here right today who don't understand why God hasn't heard your prayer and you know full well that in your hearts you've got a root of bitterness that's grown up
[time=2938] and it's just begun to mushroom in your life until it's just consuming you and your prayers might as well not even be offered.
[time=2945] You might as well talk to the man in the moon and talk to God with a spirit like that in your heart because he won't hear.
[time=2951] You say, "What is my responsibility?" Well, it's obvious. Go get that problem straightened out.
[time=2956] Go to that person that you've got bitterness against and ask for forgiveness. Get it right. Get it straightened out.
[time=2962] You may think pastors don't ever have to do that. Let me tell you something. We fight that same burden on occasion when people do things to hurt us.
[time=2971] And if we're not careful, we can let it grow and develop and be something that Satan uses to just put a barrier between God and us so that we can't pray.
[time=2980] And the only way to get that straightened out is to go right to the source of it and deal with it.
[time=2984] And then the heavens are opened again and fellowship is restored.
[time=2988] Sometimes God doesn't hear our prayer because of strife with other people.
[time=2993] Fifthly, and I want you to turn to this passage. Turn with me to 1 Peter chapter 3. This will surprise you.
[time=3005] But this is what it says. 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 7.
[time=3010] Likewise, in like manner ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life underline it, that your prayers be not hindered.
[time=3029] One of the reasons why some prayers aren't answered is because of unresolved struggles within the home and within the marriage.
[time=3037] That your prayers be not hindered.
[time=3041] Husband comes down to breakfast in the morning. His wife is cooked as breakfast, bacon and eggs.
[time=3047] He walks into the kitchen and he says, "Good night woman, can't you fix bacon without burning it?
[time=3054] This is the fourth day in a row I've had burned bacon." My goodness, I can't remember when food has been so bad around here.
[time=3062] I'm not staying here to eat this stuff and he gets up and pushes his chair back against the counter and he goes off down to the hotel to eat breakfast.
[time=3069] Now, when you see me eating breakfast down there, don't you think my wife burns the bacon?
[time=3079] Because if I'm in trouble that way, there's a whole lot of men in this congregation that are in the same boat.
[time=3085] And the little son is sitting there at the table.
[time=3089] The man stomps out and slams the door. He looks over and he sees his mother with her head buried in her hands, tears and inner eyes sobbing because she's been so ill treated.
[time=3101] And this actually happened. The little boy went over to his mother and he hugged her.
[time=3105] He said, "Mommy, aren't you sorry we married daddy?" How in the world can a man who treats his wife like that get on his knees before God and expect his prayers to be answered?
[time=3120] God won't do it. Who in the world are we dealing with? This is the Almighty, the Holy God.
[time=3127] And he doesn't just wink at our inconsistencies and our vagrant and flagrant violation of his rules and of his laws.
[time=3137] We can't be the kind of people that is embodied by a satanic approach to life and then just push that all aside gently and say,
[time=3147] "Lord, here I am again. Hear my prayer?" I wonder how many prayers God doesn't hear today because men and women who are Christians are not living like they ought to live within the home.
[time=3161] Husbands, the burden is put on you. It says you're to dwell with your wife according to knowledge, according to your knowledge of her as the weaker vessel in whom you are to invest honor.
[time=3171] According to the Word of God, according to what God says about marriage, what he says about how you should be living.
[time=3180] Isn't it interesting that answered prayer has a direct relationship to the personal involvement of individuals within the home?
[time=3190] You know, we might find a lot of prayers God answered if we'd go home and get some things right between one another, ask each other for forgiveness, for the hurt we've inflicted, for our boisterous and ungodly spirit.
[time=3204] Hug each other's necks and get it right sometimes with the children that might be necessary and then begin to pray.
[time=3211] God would be honored. You know, the passage says, "Dwell according to knowledge."
[time=3217] I remember hearing a story about a family that used to have as a custom, putting together crossword puzzle every Christmas.
[time=3225] It was sort of a holiday tradition.
[time=3227] And it was kind of an interesting thing because dad and the kids took on this project.
[time=3230] Mom always bought this present for the family. They would sit around the table doing it.
[time=3234] They weren't ever allowed to look at the box cover to get an idea of what the picture looked like.
[time=3239] They did it from scratch. One year, mom left a box cover out on the table.
[time=3244] And father and the children sat down to work the puzzle and they worked and they worked.
[time=3249] And the time elapsed that would have long since been enough time to finish it and they just had a few pieces together.
[time=3254] They were struggling, something fierce.
[time=3257] Finally, she came back in with a smile on her face and she said, "This year I bought two puzzles and you've got the wrong box cover."
[time=3267] When I read that story, I was reminded of the frustration, the unbelievable frustration of a married couple or a family
[time=3279] that is trying to put the puzzle together at home when they don't have the right box cover.
[time=3286] Do you know how many families there are like that? Some of you sitting here today.
[time=3290] You don't understand why your family is not working right, while the relationship between you and your spouse isn't what it ought to be.
[time=3297] And you're looking at the wrong box cover. You've got the world standard, Hollywood's idea of love and marriage and all of that trash you see on the two.
[time=3305] And you don't understand why it doesn't work. You've got the wrong cover, my friend, until you get the cover that goes with the puzzle.
[time=3313] It's not going to work.
[time=3316] And until it starts working, your prayers aren't going to be answered.
[time=3321] I wish I had time to give you the rest, but I've got to stop.
[time=3325] God won't answer your prayer unless your heart is right before Him.
[time=3331] Shall we pray?
[time=3337] Our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed. Let me ask this question. Do you know Christ as your personal Savior?
[time=3344] The Bible says that the only prayer that God hears from an unbeliever is the prayer. God be merciful to me, a sinner.
[time=3351] If you've never prayed that prayer and invited Christ into your life, you don't have a relationship with God.
[time=3357] But you know the joy of the ministry is that I can share with you right now, whether you're seated here in this auditorium or at home by your television set, that this very moment you can bow your head and say, "Oh God, I want to receive your gift of eternal life.
[time=3373] I confess that I'm a sinner. I've been trying to follow life with the wrong set of directions.
[time=3378] But right now, the best I know how. I invite Jesus into my life and into my heart.
[time=3384] Come in, Lord Jesus and be my Savior. Forgive my sin. I accept you right now."
[time=3390] And if you make that decision at home, will you write to us and let us know that we can send you some follow-up material and get you started in the path right?
[time=3399] Those of you here in this auditorium, if you've never prayed that prayer, you pray it right now too, will you?
[time=3404] Right there where you're seated. Lord Jesus, come into my life. Forgive my sin.
[time=3408] Accept me as a penitent sinner. I accept you as the Lord of my life.
[time=3414] Father, we believe that there will be those today who will make that decision.
[time=3419] And we ask, "Oh God, that there will be a time of commitment in the hearts and lives of men and women in this service this day."
[time=3430] Our head is still bowed and our eyes still closed.
[time=3435] You've been sharing the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
