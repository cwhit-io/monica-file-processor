[time=19] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=29] [MUSIC]
[time=46] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=52] Is it possible to commit a sin which God cannot forgive?
[time=57] Well, apparently there are some who think it is because in the short years of my ministry,
[time=63] on a number of occasions, I have had people come to me and tell me that they are convinced they have committed the unpardonable sin.
[time=72] Interestingly enough, when I have asked them what that sin was, not one of them has been able to identify the particular sin, which is the unpardonable sin, though they are very convinced they have committed it.
[time=86] What is the unpardonable sin?
[time=90] Is it possible for you, for me, to commit a sin which God will not forgive?
[time=97] That's the subject of our Bible study today from the book of Matthew in the 12th chapter.
[time=102] In a few moments, we'll be opening there to examine a very interesting situation in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=110] But first, we have a great deal of music and some exciting sharing together in the ministry of music.
[time=116] We listen now to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Don Kruger.
[time=121] [MUSIC]
[time=128] Jesus is coming, oh Jesus is coming, He's coming again at the time they begin.
[time=134] Sing to the nations, don't tell it and shout it.
[time=137] The wonderful message that everyone needs to be.
[time=145] Jesus is coming.
[time=158] Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming.
[time=171] [MUSIC]
[time=200] Jesus is coming.
[time=205] Jesus is coming, He's coming again at the time they begin.
[time=210] Sing to the nations, don't tell it and shout it.
[time=213] The wonderful message that everyone needs to be.
[time=220] Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming again, coming again, coming again.
[time=236] Jesus is coming again.
[time=246] Jesus Christ is coming again in a beautiful way today.
[time=255] The choir has reminded us that our hearts should be fixed on the day when He comes for us.
[time=261] But until that day we have been given the responsibility of being stewards of His Word.
[time=267] And this morning I would like to read for you from Hebrews chapter 10 verses 26 through 29.
[time=275] For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remains no more sacrifice for sin.
[time=286] But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.
[time=297] He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.
[time=305] Of how much more sober punishment suppose you shall he be brought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God
[time=315] and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified and unholy thing
[time=323] and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace.
[time=328] I have read for you today Hebrews chapter 10 verses 26 through 29.
[time=338] Thank you Rick. During these last few weeks we have been very excited about a new ministry that has come to pass through
[time=346] of the young ladies of our congregation, Star Narwhal. We mentioned to you that she has recently recorded an album
[time=353] which should be released in the next few months. And we have been gradually catching up with the music from that album
[time=359] here and there hearing a song and every one of them has been a real blessing and encouragement.
[time=364] She sings a song from that album entitled Turn Around. Listen now to Star Narwhal.
[time=376] When you've wandered from the Lord and his love you have ignored but so hard to turn around and go back home
[time=403] to the place where you belong and admit that you've been wrong and you wonder if you'll ever take you back.
[time=419] Sometimes you wonder but too far from his strong protective arms and you stumble and it hurts along the way.
[time=435] It's a shame that you won't learn, you're this person of concern and he loves you and he wants you to come home.
[time=453] So turn around and you hear a calling voice is so severe and it won't take you longer than to know that you've heard that voice before.
[time=474] But they open up the door to your heart and let the Savior enter in.
[time=487] He waits for you the Lord of Light, he'll see you through your darkness night. He loved you then, he loves you now. Just call on there and he'll watch your sins away.
[time=508] Turn your night to brightest day and you'll be home where you belong and there you'll stay.
[time=521] So turn around and you hear a calling voice that sounds so dear and it won't take you longer than to know that you've heard that voice before.
[time=542] The day you open up the door to your heart and let the Savior enter in.
[time=555] Turn around, won't you please come home home home home home home home home home home.
[time=576] Thank you so much for being a part of the Bible Hour today. We are indebted to all of you who are part of our greater family of fellowship as you share the Bible Hour with us each week.
[time=588] Once again I want to express a personal word of appreciation to the many of you who have been so faithful in your support of this telecast during recent days.
[time=597] A special word of thank you to the Founders Club members, many new members of this great family of men and women who support the Bible Hour regularly each month. Thank you for your consistency in your prayer and in your giving to make the Bible Hour possible in these areas where it is now seen.
[time=615] We appreciate so much the opportunity of taking these moments during the reception of our offering here in the main auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church. During these few moments that we step aside we like to talk with you about the special items that have a special meaning to those of you who are watching at home.
[time=634] Today I want to again encourage you if you have not already done so to sit down and write to us this week and request your copy of this month's special offer. A book entitled "The Four Gospels" arranged as a single narrative.
[time=649] This very helpful study tool is a book that puts together all of the narratives in the Four Gospels in one consecutive chronological issue. It means that you can read through the life of the Lord Jesus Christ without interruption.
[time=664] It means that all of the events in our Lord's life are put together in exactly the right relationship. Starting at his birth you can read all the way through to his ascension knowing that you are seeing the events as they occurred in proper relationship.
[time=680] Now this book "The Four Gospels" arranged as a single narrative is our special gift to you as a part of our ministry to those of you who are watching at home. I'm going to ask that you sit down right now and write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana and request your free copy of this book "The Four Gospels" arranged as a single narrative.
[time=707] There is no charge for the book and if you have no money to send us an offering to the telecast I hope you will take the time to sit down and request the book. It is free postage paid to each and every one of you who ask for it.
[time=722] Now before we go back to the morning service let me remind you again that it is your gifts and offerings toward this television ministry that makes it possible for us to continue ministering to you where you see this television program.
[time=736] I hope that many of you today will take the opportunity to commit yourself to pray regularly for the Bible our ministry. We do not have any other recourse, no other resource than those who are part of this ministry.
[time=751] And it is very important to us that you believe in what we're doing and that those of you who do believe in what we're doing in the teaching, the solid teaching of the Word of God that you get behind this ministry with your prayer and financial support.
[time=765] So if possible when you write to me this week if you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television time and production we would appreciate it so much.
[time=774] Let me assure you that every dime you send to us for television ministry goes directly right back into that ministry to carry this ministry on.
[time=784] We do not use it for our own church and its ministries but we use every single dime to carry the message of the gospel out to those who watch the Bible our each week.
[time=795] So let me encourage you to get behind us in your prayer and in your support and if you can write to me this week and let us know that you're standing with us.
[time=803] Once again the address when you write is right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=816] Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=825] We appreciate so much you're writing to us, you're praying for us and you're standing with us.
[time=831] I trust that you'll stay with us now as we go back to our morning service.
[time=835] In just a few moments I'm going to be speaking on the most difficult words our Lord ever uttered.
[time=842] I'm going to be talking about the unpardonable sin and I trust you'll stay with us as we study the Scripture together on This The Lord's Day.
[time=861] Thank you, Dennis, for that offer, Tori.
[time=870] In just a moment Dennis is going to be joined by Ron Hackett and they'll be singing for us before they come to share that matter of special music.
[time=877] Let me just make a couple of announcements concerning some things that will be happening in the future.
[time=882] Next week we'll have the privilege of sharing in the ministry of Claire Hess and Ray Felton.
[time=888] Some of you have been around here long enough to remember the Felton family who visited with us several times in the early days of our ministry.
[time=896] Well, Ray Felton and Claire Hess joined together in a very powerful duo that will be sharing some exciting music with us next Sunday, both in the morning and evening service.
[time=906] And then on the following week, the 25th of February, here locally and two weeks later than that everywhere else,
[time=912] we'll be having the ministry of Stephen Maria Gardner who so blessed our hearts when they were here last year on the 4th of July.
[time=919] So I trust that you'll mark these dates along with the other important things we do.
[time=923] We're excited about the people God sends to minister to us in music.
[time=927] Right now we're very excited about two young men who sing together quite well.
[time=932] We call them our version of the Bill Pierce, Dick Anthony Duet.
[time=937] I'm not going to tell you who is who, but they sure do know how to sing together.
[time=944] Listen as they share with us now Ron Hackett and Dennis Kirschner.
[time=949] [MUSIC]
[time=956] My father is a miracle ten and that you can't deny.
[time=963] A God of light and miracles is written in the sky.
[time=972] It took a miracle to put the stars in space.
[time=979] It took a miracle to bring the world in space.
[time=987] But when he saved my soul, when's that baby home?
[time=998] It took a miracle of love and grace.
[time=1009] Though here his glory has been shown, we still can't fully sing.
[time=1017] The wonder of his might is strong, we'll take eternity.
[time=1027] The Bible tells us of his power and wisdom all way through, and every little bird and flower.
[time=1041] Our testimony is true.
[time=1047] It took a miracle to put the stars in place.
[time=1055] It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
[time=1063] But when he saved my soul, when's that baby home?
[time=1076] It took a miracle, it took a miracle.
[time=1084] It took a miracle, it took a miracle of love and grace.
[time=1097] [MUSIC]
[time=1104] The message of miracles is a theme for some of our music today.
[time=1108] Just before the message, we're going to listen to the ministry of our own Black Hawk Singers as they come to remind us that we serve the Lord of Miracles, the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1121] [MUSIC]
[time=1130] The Lord of Miracles is living in me.
[time=1142] There's God in me, can I do if I will just be me?
[time=1150] [MUSIC]
[time=1161] The Lord of Miracles will find me my greatest dreams, greater streams.
[time=1175] Look for a miracle and on his path.
[time=1184] The heart that raised all our from death in that dark and lonely heart.
[time=1195] Praise Him that God's land to make me feel free.
[time=1204] Now it's all available to those who trust in you.
[time=1213] The Lord of Miracles is living in me.
[time=1223] There's God in me, can I do if I will just be me?
[time=1233] [MUSIC]
[time=1239] The Lord of Miracles will find me my greatest dreams, greater streams.
[time=1259] The Lord of Miracles will be in me.
[time=1273] [MUSIC]
[time=1278] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1280] And now will you join me with your Bibles open to the 12th chapter of the Book of Matthew.
[time=1285] Matthew chapter 12 and I want to read from the 12th chapter of the Book of Matthew beginning at the 22nd verse.
[time=1293] Now this is the passage which contains the source of all of the questions related to the unpardonable sin.
[time=1302] It is the passage which is the parallel passage of that found over in the Book of Mark in the third chapter.
[time=1309] But this incident which I'm going to read for you is the incident from which the term the unpardonable sin originates.
[time=1316] And so we're going to examine it today and understand hopefully what God would have us to know from this experience in the life of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1326] We're reading from the 12th chapter of the Book of Matthew verse 22.
[time=1330] Then was brought unto Jesus, one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb, and he healed him in so much that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.
[time=1340] And all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of David.
[time=1345] But when the Pharisees heard it they said, "This fellow doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of demons."
[time=1352] And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation."
[time=1359] And every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
[time=1363] And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself, how shall then his kingdoms stand?
[time=1371] And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out, therefore they shall be your judges.
[time=1379] But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.
[time=1384] Or else how can one enter in his strong man's house and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house?
[time=1393] He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
[time=1398] Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blaspheme shall be forgiven men, but the blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven men.
[time=1408] And whosoever speaketh the word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him, but whoso speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, neither in the age to come.
[time=1421] Shall we pray together?
[time=1424] Father, these words which we have read from the New Testament, the words of Jesus Christ himself are the most harsh and bitter words to ever fall from his lips.
[time=1439] There are words which are fraught with destiny, words which have the mark of eternity stamped upon them, words which sound a warning which we cannot miss.
[time=1453] But O God in heaven, these are words which have been misunderstood, and which have been used to bring emotional impact by misunderstanding and misinterpretation, and we would be faithful to the word of God today.
[time=1476] We would say that which God would have us to say, we would go not one wit beyond the bounds of Scripture, and yet we would see the solemnity that is here in all of its warning and all of its prophecy and all of its seriousness to each of our hearts and to those whom we love.
[time=1501] We pray that the Spirit of God will be our teacher, open our minds and our hearts to the truth, make us to be good students of thy word today, and then Lord, may we take the truth we learn and apply it in our lives each day. In Christ's name I pray, amen.
[time=1519] The most solemn words ever to fall from the lips of the Lord Jesus Christ are the words it shall not be forgiven.
[time=1528] The God who is known because of his forgiving spirit, pronouncing that there is some situation, there is one particular problem, there is some aspect of life which goes beyond the boundaries of the forgiveness of the Almighty God.
[time=1547] It is not what we expect to hear from the God of love. It is not what we expect to come from the lips of the Savior who came to give his life a ransom for many that they might know forgiveness, who by his death upon the cross paid the price that many might be forgiven.
[time=1564] Yet we cannot miss the very clear words of the Savior, for he says, "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come."
[time=1579] Now in order for us to understand the words of our Savior, we must go back into the context of this passage.
[time=1585] We must seek to understand the situation which called forth these words from the lips of the Savior. We must apply these words to our own day, to our own situation, and to our own lives.
[time=1597] The situation which called forth the words of our Savior is recorded in the 22nd and 23rd verse of our text.
[time=1605] It is the story of our Lord's casting out a demon from an individual. This casting out of a demon, this exorcism on the part of our Savior took the form of a healing.
[time=1617] The Scripture says that he healed this man in so much that now he became everything that he was not here to for.
[time=1626] The nature of this healing is a unique incident. It is a very particular kind of healing that our Lord wrought.
[time=1633] It is a very difficult situation for us to comprehend, for the Scripture says this man was blind and dumb.
[time=1641] That means that he could not speak and he could not see. And those who understand that situation say that it was just a part of that that he could not hear either, that he could not understand.
[time=1654] So our Lord was dealing with a problem of "exorcism" where his words could not be understood nor comprehended by the person to whom he was speaking.
[time=1665] And yet the Scripture says he healed this man. No exorcist could handle this since he could not even communicate with this man, but our Lord healed him.
[time=1675] And the result of this healing was, according to the text, that there was a great confusion among the people. There were two different reactions to his healing.
[time=1685] Some of the people thought that this meant that they had now faced the Messiah, the one who had been promised.
[time=1694] Their response to his healing, at the end of the verse, is not this the Son of David, or is not this the Messiah, the Promised One, is not this the one we have been looking forward to seeing, is not this the Promised Redeemer of Israel.
[time=1708] The result of some of the people was that the work, the miracle of Christ, called forth within them, a response to his authority, and to help them to see that this was indeed the Christ, the Messiah.
[time=1721] But the result in the lives of those people is contrasted to the result in the lives of the Pharisees, for we read that when the Pharisees heard it, their reaction was very different.
[time=1732] They reacted against it. They said this is not the Messiah, but this is one who has cast out a demon by the Prince of Demons, by Beelzebub.
[time=1742] They said that this is one who has leaked himself together with Satan, and since the demons are satanic, he himself has made a deal with Satan to have these demons cast out.
[time=1753] So we have a situation, and we have two reactions to that situation, some who believed, and some who denied and renounced.
[time=1762] Now the sin. The sin is found in the reaction of the Pharisees to the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of Christ.
[time=1772] The situation is the miracle. The sin is the charge against Jesus Christ that he is working his miracles through the power of Satan.
[time=1782] You see, the Pharisees had come to the place where there was no large logical argument against the evident results of Christ's miracles.
[time=1790] They could not explain it. There was no way they could gain say it. Nothing had been produced like that from the miracles they knew among the Jewish exorcists.
[time=1799] And so when they were up against the wall and they had no place to go, they did what some debaters do when they have lost all of their argument.
[time=1808] Instead of dealing with the issue, they attacked the opponent, and so that's what they did.
[time=1813] They began to attack what Jesus had done, and they said, Satan is obliging his friend.
[time=1821] He is obliging his friend Jesus by withdrawing demons from men.
[time=1826] And their argument was then, who would want to follow such a person who is in league with Satan who was a friend of Satan as Jesus obviously is?
[time=1835] The sin, which is sometimes referred to as the unpardonable sin, and about which Jesus later says it shall not be forgiven is the sin of attributing to Satan the work of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1849] I want you to notice something about this because I think we could get off in a wild goose chase about some theoretical sin that could happen to somebody else and not understand what's going on here.
[time=1861] There are three things about their sin that I want you to notice. First of all, it was premeditated. It was a premeditated sin.
[time=1870] If we had time this morning, we could turn in our Bibles to three or four other passages of Scripture where the Pharisees had attributed to Satan the work of Christ.
[time=1883] One time, when he was performing a miracle near Capernaum, they said that Jesus was working by means of demons. That's recorded in Matthew chapter 9 and verse 34.
[time=1893] Another time, while he was ministering in Judea, as recorded in Luke chapter 11 verses 14 to 23, again the Pharisees said, Jesus is using demon power to do his almighty work.
[time=1905] And again, here in this situation in Galilee, they made the same charge.
[time=1910] I want you to notice people that these words of the Pharisees were not just words of a moment.
[time=1915] Initial reactions to some situation which was portrayed in their midst, not just a spur of the moment, evaluation of what they were viewing, but this was a premeditated, a calculated statement on the part of these Pharisees.
[time=1930] The Pharisees had developed this attitude toward Jesus and his ministry. If you go back in the old writings in the beginning of the book of Matthew, in the old relationship that Christ had with the Pharisees before his miraculous powers began to be demonstrated, you will see that the Pharisees' first attitude toward him was one of curiosity.
[time=1950] They sought to know more about this Messiah. Their curiosity then developed into a sense of indifference because it did not do anything for their commitment to Jewish excellence.
[time=1961] And then their indifference developed into a spirit of denial. And then the denial took on malicious attitudes, attacking the one who professed to be a Messiah.
[time=1972] And then their denial and maliciousness brought forth the sense of blaspheme, which we see here, and ultimately their blaspheme brought them to a spirit of vengeance which put Jesus Christ on the cross, nailed between two thieves.
[time=1987] The Pharisees did not just say, "Well, there's a miracle here. It must be of Satan." No, they had gradually developed within them a spirit of bitterness and resentment and rejection until when they could not any longer explain what Jesus was doing, they attacked him and they said, "We'll explain it our way." He does it in the power of Satan. It was a premeditated sin.
[time=2009] I say that simply to point out that no one ever stumbles in by accident to commit an unpardonable sin. Every once in a while when people tell me they've committed the unpardonable sin, I get the impression that they weren't intending to do it. They weren't planning to do it, but all of a sudden they were in a situation before they knew it zapped.
[time=2024] They did it. It's over and it's done. They're doomed to hell, never again to be recovered, and the unpardonable sin has been committed.
[time=2031] Now I say to you, first of all, that the sin known as the unpardonable sin was a premeditated, cold, calculated response of indifference and rejection to the Lord Jesus Christ in His work.
[time=2043] Secondly, it was a presumptuous sin. By that I mean it was a sin of knowledge. It wasn't that they didn't know the truth, but it was that they refused to believe the truth.
[time=2053] They had been among the crowds and the multitudes who had seen Jesus working the miracles. They had heard His pronunciation of prophecy, and they knew enough about the Old Testament to know that what they were seeing in front of them was in reality the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.
[time=2072] But the more Jesus did, the more they opposed Him. And when they could no longer deny Him, they blasphemed Him, and they attacked Him. This was a presumptuous sin, a sin of knowledge, a sin of premeditation.
[time=2088] But I want you to notice, thirdly, that it was a permanent sin. This was a sin of finality. When they could no longer ignore Him, they rejected Him completely.
[time=2102] It's like the character in one of Milton's writings, the character Satan, Milton's Satan. The line is attributed to Milton concerning his Satan that he said, "Evil, be thou my good."
[time=2118] That's what these people had done. They had turned the tables completely around, and they said, "Evil, be thou my good. Evil, I will embrace you." I have decided not to accept that which is good, but I have made evil my good, and I will fall down before the throne of the evil, rather than accept the clear presentation of God and His Messiah.
[time=2139] Oh, we cannot in any way exaggerate too much the awful seriousness of what these people had done, what they had determined to do, what they had premeditated and calculated in their own mind to do, and that is to refuse and reject, and finally, and once and for all, put Jesus Christ out of their lives and out of their minds and out of their hearts, the sin.
[time=2163] Well, I want you to notice the Savior's response to their charges. Before He gets to the pronouncement of the irreversible nature of their sin, He contraverts their charges.
[time=2177] He brings an answer to their charges, and their very interesting answers basically says three things. First of all, in verse 25, He says this, "Jesus knew their thoughts, and He said unto them, every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
[time=2196] And if Satan cast out Satan, he's divided against himself, how shall then his kingdom stand?" In other words, his argument was, you say I'm casting out demons by Beelzebub, the prince or Satan.
[time=2209] But Jesus said, now look, that doesn't even make any logical sense. Satan isn't going to cast out his own people. If Satan isn't agreement with Satan, he won't have any kingdom.
[time=2219] But it's obvious that it couldn't be of Satan that the demons are exercised because that would be a rift within the kingdom of Satan, and obviously that couldn't happen. Satan wouldn't cast out his own emissaries, not when he's implanted him in a person, and as control of the person, why would Satan never do that?
[time=2236] And the second argument that Jesus gave was this. He said, you have exorcists. You Jewish have exorcists. You Pharisees have exorcists among you. Let me ask you this question. According to the text, who do your sons cast out demons by?
[time=2255] If Jesus was the Christ standing in their presence, and if they accuse him of casting out demons in the power of Satan, the obvious question is, all right, I've noticed your exorcist casting out demons, and some of them can't cast the demons all out, so that's why I'm getting all the traffic, because they're coming to me, your exorcist can't handle it, so I'm getting them.
[time=2277] Now my question is, by whose power do you cast out your demons? It's interesting that there is no answer. There is no answer of the Lord in this situation.
[time=2291] And then the last thing that he said was this. I want you to know that the reason this is happening is because the kingdom of God has come.
[time=2301] If Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself. How shall then his kingdom stand? And if I buy Beelzebub cast out demons by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come unto you.
[time=2318] Now what did he mean by that? He meant simply this, that this act of Christ in casting out demons was the beginning of Jesus Christ's binding of Satan's kingdom, and he was binding Satan by taking his prey from him.
[time=2336] He was putting chains around the demons of Satan, and his argument was this. Because I am destroying Satan's kingdom, it is for the purpose of establishing my own. And the very act of destroying Satan and casting out these demons is another evidence that I have come to establish the kingdom of God in order to establish one kingdom, the other kingdom must be destroyed.
[time=2358] And in one act he was destroying the kingdom of Satan, and in the other act he was establishing his own kingdom for all men to see, for all men to know.
[time=2371] Jesus said, "What you have charged me with is a false accusation. It doesn't make any logical sense, it doesn't make any spiritual sense, and it doesn't make any prophetic sense.
[time=2384] I have come to establish my kingdom, and I have bound Satan as a precursor to that."
[time=2392] Now let's go back and take a look at this sin as it applies to us. Let's just give a brief summary of what has happened here.
[time=2400] I have said before that the unpardonable sin should be defined as attributing to Satan the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2410] I want us to take a look at this sin in several different aspects so that we can examine our own hearts and see where that leaves us as Christians and perhaps as non-Christians.
[time=2420] First of all I want you to note that this was a sin directed against the Holy Spirit, directed against the third person of the Trinity.
[time=2429] The Pharisees put themselves on Satan's side by accusing Jesus of being in league with Satan.
[time=2437] The Pharisees jumped over the line and got on the team of Satan, and now they were shooting at Jesus Christ, and they were saying, "Jesus, you have used the power of Satan instead of the power of the Holy Spirit."
[time=2450] It's interesting as we come to the last two verses of this text what Jesus had to say to these who were accusing him such.
[time=2458] He said, "All manner of sin and blaspheme shall be forgiven of men, but the blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven."
[time=2465] Now notice, "Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, or Christ, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever speaketh the word against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him."
[time=2477] You say, "Pastor Jeremiah, why is there a differentiation in the Trinity? Why is it more of a problem to sin against the Holy Spirit than it is to sin against Jesus Christ?"
[time=2489] Well, it is quite possible that men might misunderstand the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. That could be understandable, though it's deplorable, it's understandable.
[time=2500] It's still forgivable to misunderstand, but a man who in a cold and calculated way thinks back through the powerful expression of Christ and looks at his power and says that power is of Satan, and he takes away the Holy Spirit from his place of authority in the life of Christ,
[time=2518] that man has sinned to sin, which is irreversible.
[time=2522] I like what O.B.H. Carroll, an old Southern Baptist pastor many years ago, wrote.
[time=2527] He said, "If one blaspheme's the Father, there still remains the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2533] If he blaspheme's the Son, there is yet the Holy Spirit.
[time=2537] But if he blaspheme's the Holy Spirit, there is none left.
[time=2541] He has rejected deity altogether, and there is no recourse.
[time=2547] It is the end result of a gradual, habitual, and growing enmity against God."
[time=2554] Will you mark it down that this is a sin against the Holy Spirit?
[time=2559] Alfred Plummer, a great expositor and one to whom many expository preachers are greatly indebted for his writings on the Scripture.
[time=2569] Made this comment upon this "unpardonable sin," he wrote, "There is such a thing as opposition to divine influence,
[time=2580] so persistent, so deliberate, because of the constant preference of darkness to light
[time=2586] that repentance and therefore forgiveness becomes impossible." The efficacy of divine grace remains undiminished.
[time=2594] In other words, God doesn't diminish his grace.
[time=2597] That's not the issue.
[time=2599] But the sinner has brought himself to such a condition that the operation of grace on him is excluded.
[time=2606] And then he uses this illustration.
[time=2608] He said, "It is like bodily food which you may reject until the power to receive it is lost."
[time=2620] Christ warned the Pharisees that they are perilously near that condition.
[time=2626] And against the dictates of reason and justice, they had deliberately treated as diabolical a work of great mercy and grace.
[time=2636] In the light of the miracle of God casting out a demon and bringing to his senses a man with three deep seated sicknesses.
[time=2649] In the light of that, they had rejected all the evidence and had accused the Messiah.
[time=2657] This sin is a sin against the Holy Spirit.
[time=2661] But I want you to notice, secondly, that it is a sin determined by a special situation.
[time=2668] It was not a sin of the tongue.
[time=2671] It wasn't.
[time=2672] Sometimes I hear people talk about the blaspheming of the Holy Spirit, and I get the impression that that means that they may take the Holy Spirit's name in vain, or they may say something evil about the Holy Spirit.
[time=2681] A sin of the tongue, a slip of the tongue, or maybe a moment of anger.
[time=2687] That's not it at all.
[time=2688] It's not a sin of the tongue.
[time=2690] Oh, yes, it came out through the mouth, but it was just the expression of a deep seated rejection of Christ himself.
[time=2697] It was a sin of word, but it was a sin of word that evidenced the sin of heart attitude.
[time=2703] They had come to the place in their lives where they would not expect or inspect any evidence.
[time=2708] They would not hear anything that Christ said.
[time=2710] They had determined in the callous cold heart of unbelief to reject Jesus Christ.
[time=2716] No matter what happened, no matter what evidence was shown to them, they said we will not hear it, we will reject.
[time=2722] And so the words of blaspheming simply were an expression of a deep heart attitude of unbelief.
[time=2731] May I say to you that the special situation of this sin was that it was committed in the presence of the Almighty God, in the presence of Jesus Christ, the incarnate.
[time=2740] Once in a while, I hear people say, if only I could have lived in the day of Christ, then I would have believed.
[time=2746] If only I could have been present when he worked his miracles, then I would have believed.
[time=2750] But here were a group of religious leaders, the religious aristocracy of their day, and in the presence of divine miracles by the Son of God, they rejected.
[time=2761] And they determined not to believe, and they finally once and for all refused the offer of eternal life.
[time=2771] Somebody asked me one day if this sin could be committed in our generation, because Christ isn't physically present.
[time=2779] May I say to you that attributing the works of Satan, or the works of the Holy Spirit to Satan, and once and for all,
[time=2786] and finally rejecting Jesus Christ has the same and exact penalty today that it had back then.
[time=2793] It is an unpardonable sin.
[time=2795] It is a sin which cannot be forgiven.
[time=2800] And I want you to notice, thirdly, that the nature of this sin was that it was damning to the soul.
[time=2805] He said it cannot be forgiven in this age, nor in the age to come.
[time=2810] It can never be forgiven. Why? Because when you've rejected the only offer of salvation and the only provision for eternal life, when you've rejected that, there's nothing left.
[time=2822] If you say I will not have Christ, and I will not have His blood, and I will not have His salvation, that's an unpardonable sin because there's no other way.
[time=2831] There's no plan B or plan C. God only has one plan, and if you throw that out, there's nothing left, and it's unpardonable.
[time=2838] There's no recourse available to you.
[time=2840] If a tree could reach down and pull out its roots so that there was no longer any contact with the soil and the environment in which it lived, it would soon wither and die.
[time=2852] By pulling its roots out of the soil, it would have committed the unpardonable sin.
[time=2856] If a house could somehow lift itself off of the foundation, it would soon crumble because a house without a foundation cannot stand.
[time=2865] If a mariner out on the ocean determines he will not look at the stars and he will not look at the maps and he will not watch the instruments.
[time=2873] Ultimately, he has committed the unpardonable sin because there's no other means of navigation.
[time=2878] If a pilot who pilots the great ships that fly across our country, if he determines that he will not look at the instrument panel, he will not listen to the control tower, and he has decided to do it his own way, and he will reject and not have anything to do with the one who would control him.
[time=2895] That pilot is committed the unpardonable sin. There's no other way to guide a ship. There's no other way to know the relationship of that which you guide to the other ships that are around you.
[time=2909] Such rejection you see is not the sin, but it is the final cumulative result of a hardened heart against the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2926] It is not because God withdraws his grace. God doesn't change his mind. In fact, it's interesting to me that in this most harshest of passages, we have a reminder from the Lord that every sin will be forgiven. Isn't that interesting?
[time=2942] Jesus wants to make sure that we know there is no individual sin that will not be forgiven. He says, "All manner of sin and blaspheme will be forgiven of men, but there's one sin I cannot forgive, and that's the sin of rejecting my plan of salvation, my means of redemption, my program for eternal life.
[time=2966] And a man who comes to the place where he has so finally and callously and coldly rejected Christ to the point where he now is attacking Christ and attributing his powerful works to Satan.
[time=2981] That man has crossed over the line where never again he will be able to hear and respond." You say, "Pastor Jeremiah, how do you know when you come to that place? I'm not sure that any of us could know.
[time=2999] May I say this, if this bothers you and if you're bothered by it, then probably you haven't crossed over that line yet because you see a man who has come to the place of rebellion and indifference and rejection has moved beyond the ability of the Holy Spirit to contact his heart.
[time=3015] You see, the only means God has of getting through to man is through the Spirit of God, and if you say, "I'll not have the Spirit of God," and if you blaspheme the Spirit of God and you put him in the same category with Satan, you have removed the only link God has with you.
[time=3029] And he can't touch you anymore. He can't contact you anymore. But if you're troubled by my comments today and if you are concerned that perhaps you might have come to that place, then it's in reality not related to you.
[time=3047] One time Stephen was preaching, his message recorded in the 7th of Acts, and he said, "Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised of heart, you do always resist the Holy Spirit."
[time=3064] That's the road to the unpardonable sin. The passage that Rick read for us a few moments ago, over in the 10th chapter of the Book of Hebrews,
[time=3075] chapter 10, verse 26, says, "If we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
[time=3092] Verse 29, "Of how much sore punishment, suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God, hath counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace."
[time=3111] I believe that the unpardonable sin is a sin, which at least from our perspective in the church is a sin committed by those who have been exposed to the truth.
[time=3125] It would be quite impossible for somebody to reject that which they had not heard.
[time=3130] But a person who sits under the Gospel week in and week out and hears the claims of Christ and continually trods that underfoot and counts the blood of the covenant of no avail, saying, "I'll not have that," and does despite to the Spirit of grace.
[time=3143] The Scripture says, "That person will receive a sore punishment." That means they're going to be degrees of punishment, if I understand the Bible, based upon our understanding of the Gospel.
[time=3157] You say, "Pastor, can I commit the unpardonable sin?" If you're a Christian, no.
[time=3161] There are some sins against the Holy Spirit which a Christian can commit. The Bible says we're not to quench the Holy Spirit.
[time=3168] That means we're not to allow His influence to be put out of our lives. The Bible says as Christians we're not to grieve the Holy Spirit, and that means to do that which causes Him to grieve in our sin.
[time=3179] The Bible says we're not to lie against the Holy Spirit and the illustration of Ananias and Sephira in the book of Acts is clear, but no a Christian cannot commit the unpardonable sin.
[time=3190] I want to tell you something, if you don't know Jesus Christ and you have consistently rejected Him over and over again, you may be on the road to the ultimate final rejection.
[time=3202] Some years ago I came across these lines. I've never been able to find out who wrote them, but they so graphically express what I've tried to say this morning.
[time=3213] There is a time I know not when, a place I know not where which marks the destiny of men to heaven or despair.
[time=3225] There is a line by us not seen which crosses every path, the hidden boundary between God's patience and His wrath.
[time=3234] To cross that limit is to die. To die is if by stealth. It may not pale the beaming eye nor quench the growing health.
[time=3244] The conscience may be still at ease, the spirits light and gay, that which is pleasing still may please and care be thrust away.
[time=3255] But on that forehead God hath set indelibly a mark.
[time=3262] By men unseen, for man as yet is blind and in the dark. And still the doomed man's path below may bloom like Eden's bloomed.
[time=3272] He did not, does not, will not know nor feel that he is doomed.
[time=3277] He feels, he sees that all is well, his every fear is calmed.
[time=3282] He lives, he dies, he wakes in hell, not only doomed but damned.
[time=3288] Oh, where is that mysterious born by which each path is crossed?
[time=3294] Beyond which God himself hath sworn that he who goes is lost.
[time=3299] How long may men go on in sin? How long will God forbear?
[time=3305] Where does hope end and where begin the confines of despair?
[time=3310] One answer from those skies is sent. Ye who from God depart while it is called today repent and harden, not your heart.
[time=3326] Shall we pray?
[time=3328] Father, we do not know the hearts of men today, here or wherever the word is preached.
[time=3337] But there are some who have rejected, who have over and over again said no, who may be on that roadway toward that awful, awful final rejection, the unpardonable sin of unbelief.
[time=3354] Perhaps this will be the last clear invitation they will hear, the last opportunity they will have to say yes.
[time=3361] May it be Lord that they will respond while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
[time=3369] Every Christian is praying.
[time=3374] I want to ask you this question. Do you know Jesus Christ is your savior?
[time=3379] Have you come to trust him personally? Will you do it? Will you do it today?
[time=3386] Here in our auditorium, every individual looking into their own heart, I want to ask you, do you know Christ?
[time=3396] Have you accepted him as your savior? As long as the Spirit of God speaks to your heart, it is the time of grace, it is the time of opportunity.
[time=3406] There may come a day if you continue to reject when he will no longer strive with your heart and with your spirit, but right now he knocks upon it.
