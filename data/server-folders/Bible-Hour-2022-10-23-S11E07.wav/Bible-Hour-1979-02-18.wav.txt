[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=14] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=21] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=26] [MUSIC]
[time=52] Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=58] In a few moments, we're going to be opening the Word of God to the 107th Psalm, which has been read here in our auditorium, in our hearing, sharing together some information
[time=70] from the Word of God, and some information from the realm of life that relates to a current problem we experience right now as a church and a ministry.
[time=81] I have written letters to all of you, and you have come this morning with expectation.
[time=87] There is a sense of expectancy in your heart as we share together the nature of our need,
[time=96] and I know that as our hearts are prepared through the ministry of music, we will be praying that God will speak to us through His Word as we come to it in just a few moments.
[time=104] Our special guests this day, our Stephen Maria Gardner, they're going to be singing for us in a little while, but first of all, let us now listen to the ministry of our choir as they sing for us the song entitled,
[time=118] "And Can It Be?" [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=293] Those of us who know the Lord understand that to be the most amazing fact in all of history, that God could love us and that He could meet us at the point of our need in our sin and redeem us to be one of His own.
[time=306] In the book of Isaiah, there is a great passage that exalts the holiness of God, and our special guest, Stephen Maria Gardner, have one of the most beautiful renditions of that truth that I have ever heard.
[time=319] They're a joy to our hearts, they've been here before, they're good friends personally, they love the Lord and they minister in music, and I know that their ministry to us now in this great song will be a great encouragement.
[time=332] [MUSIC]
[time=340] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty.
[time=345] Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[time=354] All the nations of the earth will come and bow before thee, for thou hast created all things.
[time=363] [MUSIC]
[time=368] As we sing of God's holiness today, will you invite Him to minister to you, to speak to your heart, to search your heart as the scripture says, and know your thoughts.
[time=380] [MUSIC]
[time=385] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=399] Lord God Almighty, and we lift our hearts before your eyes are too green a while.
[time=412] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=421] Gracious Father, Gracious Father.
[time=429] We are so blessed to be your children, Gracious Father,
[time=438] and we lift our hearts before your eyes are too green a while.
[time=447] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=500] All the saints of authority, resting down their golden grounds,
[time=516] all around the blessed city.
[time=524] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=560] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
[time=570] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=600] I want to express my appreciation to each of you who share this hour with us today and ask that you be much in prayer during these next moments as we communicate with you at home, the very special nature of today's telecast.
[time=622] During the past few weeks we have been doing our very best to share with you at home the importance of your involvement in this television ministry.
[time=632] God has wonderfully blessed us over these past years. Just recently in a survey taken of our stations we learned of the number of people who are being touched by the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=644] Everywhere we go within the scope of the Bible hours ministry we meet people who are blessed and encouraged by the ministry. Just the other night as we were coming back from Grand Rapids, Rick Hawks my associate and I stopped in a restaurant near Angola to eat.
[time=659] We were discussing then some of the financial problems we face as a television ministry. As I got up to leave to pay the bill and to leave the restaurant, someone across the restaurant called my name and asked me to come over.
[time=671] He introduced himself to me and then introduced to me his mother who was in a walker and he explained to me that the Bible hour had been her church for many, many months and how appreciative he was of the ministry of the Word of God to her heart because she could not get out to church.
[time=687] I know that there are many, many hundreds and thousands of people in the area of the Bible hour ministry who believe in what we're doing. Each week we get letters from people who say, "Pastor Jeremiah we're so grateful that you preach the Word of God, that you minister from the Bible and that you don't spend time on the air in promotion and raising money and all of the gimmickry that so often fills the air of many television ministries."
[time=713] And that's what we're committed to. As God is my witness, what we want to do more than anything else is to open the Scripture and teach the Word of God so that men and women can come to know God better so that they can come to know Jesus Christ in a personal way.
[time=729] But the fact of the matter is whether we do promotion on the air or not, it costs the Bible hour exactly the same amount of money to purchase television time as it costs all of the other ministries.
[time=740] And though we are grateful for the good response that we get from our friends at home who talk to us and tell us that they appreciate the ministry, we cannot survive on television unless the people who are excited about what we're doing get involved in helping us do what we believe needs to be done in television ministry today.
[time=760] I recognize that there's a great deal that goes on in the name of television ministry that is not pleasing to the Lord. I understand that. We don't want that ever to happen to the Bible hour. In fact, we're committed to the principle of going off the air before that would happen to us.
[time=776] But as earnestly as I know how, I need to communicate to you today that the Bible hour needs your help. Many of you who have never written to us before and are behind this ministry and excited about what we're doing need to sit down today and write us a note and enclose a gift to help the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=796] In a few days, many of you will be receiving a letter from my desk. Some of you have already received it. That letter explains to you a special need we have at this hour because we have not written, because we have not promoted, because we have not asked for money over a long period of time, we face a very serious crisis during these days.
[time=817] And I recognize that if we don't meet the need during these next two or three weeks, we are going to be faced with curtailing the ministry of the Bible hour in a number of areas where it is now seen.
[time=828] This is not a wolf wolf cry on my part. It is not a false plea. It is not an attempt to arouse your sympathy and emotion so that you will do something you don't want to do.
[time=840] It is an attempt on my part to explain to you the real need we have at this time. There isn't anyone else I can go to but to you. You are the ones who support this ministry because you are the ones who benefit from it.
[time=854] Now I want to ask you to do something for me. First of all, I want you to sit down right now and write me a letter.
[time=860] And in the letter I want you to share with me that the Bible hour ministers to your heart if indeed it does and then enclose a gift as much as you can possibly give during this time to help in the needs of the Bible hour during these days when we have financial stress.
[time=877] Secondly, if you receive a letter from my desk, I want you to read it every word and I want you to ask God what you can do in response to this appeal.
[time=887] Every single dollar, every single nickel, every single penny that you send to the Bible hour goes right back in to providing the ministry that you receive in your home.
[time=897] I don't receive one penny of it. No one here on the staff is getting any portion of this money. It is going right into the television ministry.
[time=906] And frankly, we just need so many more of you to be involved in helping us. If we are going to meet the needs of our people who are depending on the Bible hour for their spiritual food and encouragement, it is going to take many, many more of you to get behind us.
[time=921] I'm going to ask that you write to me today. When you write, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=931] Write that address down right now before you forget. And some of you who have been meaning to communicate to us but haven't done it yet, if ever there was a time when we need to hear from you, it's during these days.
[time=943] We stepped out by faith four years ago to inaugurate this Bible teaching ministry over the air. God is wonderfully supplied. He has not promised us that we won't have problems and we have had them.
[time=954] But every time we have had a need and we have shared it with our friends, they have met that need. And we're confident that there are many of you who will do that this week.
[time=964] Once again, when you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=975] There are many hundreds of people who are counting on you to help keep this ministry on the air. And we're trusting that God will burden your heart so that you will do all you possibly can do during these days.
[time=988] I want to take just a moment to talk to some of you who are businessmen. We have a number of businessmen who over the years have helped us significantly in the television ministry.
[time=998] And though it is true that the ministry basically is stabilized by the regular people who send small and medium-sized gifts as they're able to do it, if we're going to meet the crisis we face now, it's going to be necessary for some businessmen who hear this television ministry to write out a check for a large amount to help us during this crisis time.
[time=1020] In the past, there have been a number who have done that, and we're going to ask that you do it now as God enables you to do it. I don't know of a better way for you to invest your money dollar for dollar.
[time=1031] Your investment in lives could not be better spent. We are touching many hundreds of people through this ministry, and as you invest, you have a part in reaching them for the glory of God.
[time=1044] I have thought over these past days of whether or not we should continue this ministry. Frankly, the stress and the pressure of the financial commitment is something that I could do without personally.
[time=1057] But as I've re-examined and as I've shared in the research again into the ministry of television, I have come out of that process more committed than I've ever been to the fact that God has started this ministry. He has ordained it.
[time=1070] He's kept his hand upon it from the very beginning, and he's going to see it through during these next days.
[time=1076] So when you have an opportunity today, as soon as the telecast is over, sit down and write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, will be looking forward to hearing from you in just a few days.
[time=1091] And now in a moment, we're going to hear some more music from our special guest, Stephen Maria Gardner, and I'm going to be opening the word to share with you and all of our people here in this congregation, the biblical basis for our situation now, and a plan of recovery
[time=1105] that God has outlined for us in his word. I hope you'll stay with us.
[time=1109] What I have to say in this morning's message is especially pertinent to those of you who are watching at home, and we'll be trusting that you'll be right there listening and recording every word in your own heart so that you may be responsive to what God would say to you during this hour.
[time=1125] May God bless you as you stand with us. We appreciate every one of you who help, and especially those who are going to write to us this week and help us during this time.
[time=1150] Thank you, Dennis. Now, Stephen Maria are coming back, and they're going to sing for us a song that centers around what you and I as believers enjoy every day, or as often as we have our time of prayer and devotion with the Lord.
[time=1164] They're going to sing the song in the garden. The chorus says, "He walks with me. He talks with me. He tells me I am his own." Nice to have you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1180] I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses, and the voice I hear falling on my ear.
[time=1210] The son of God discloses, and he walks with me, and he talks with me, and he tells me I am his own.
[time=1236] And the joy we share as we tell him, none other has ever healed him.
[time=1258] He walks in the sound of his voice is so sweet, the birds hush their seed, and the melody that he gave to me.
[time=1282] Within my heart is ringing, and he walks with me, and he talks with me, and he tells me I am his own.
[time=1308] And the joy we share as we tell him, none other has ever known.
[time=1327] None other has ever healed him.
[time=1353] And I know they be delighted to meet you in the foyer after the service this morning. You be sure and stop by their table and meet them and express your appreciation to them for their ministry.
[time=1363] They're going to be back again in just a few weeks, and we're going to see more of them than we have in the past because we appreciate their ministry so much.
[time=1372] It's a wonderful thing to know when the times of life come that give you some testing and difficulty and trial that there is one part of your life that the adversary cannot touch, and that is your soul.
[time=1387] He may kill the body, but he cannot touch the soul, and our Black Hawk singers are reminding us of that great truth. As they sing for us, a hymn entitled, "It is Well, It is Well with My Soul."
[time=1414] When peace, like a river, attendeth my way.
[time=1424] When sorrows I see, willows roll, willows roll.
[time=1434] Whatever my love now has taught me to say, "It is Well, It is Well with My Soul."
[time=1454] "It is Well, It is Well with My Soul."
[time=1475] My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=1486] My sin, not in part, but the whole.
[time=1496] Is hill to the cross, and thy bearing no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul."
[time=1519] And Lord, may His love be with my face shall be strong, but loved beable now, as the scroll.
[time=1538] O Lord, from there shall sound, as the Lord shall be strong.
[time=1548] It is well with my soul.
[time=1569] It is well, It is well, It is well with my soul.
[time=1586] It is well with my soul.
[time=1602] I don't believe I've ever heard them better, have you?
[time=1605] Amen. Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1607] Now will you open your Bibles to the 107th Psalm, and let us look together at the passage of scripture
[time=1614] that we had read in our hearing here in the auditorium just a few moments ago, Psalm 107.
[time=1626] And we began our reading a few moments ago in the 23rd verse.
[time=1629] Let me read again just the first two or three verses as we set the tone for this message.
[time=1635] They that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters, these see the works of the Lord
[time=1643] and his wonders in the deep.
[time=1647] These see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep.
[time=1653] Shall we pray together?
[time=1655] Our father, we ask that you will guide our lips as the thoughts of this hour are expressed.
[time=1662] We thank you for the ministry of the Holy Spirit within our hearts to guide and direct and give us wisdom
[time=1670] as we deal with some of the areas of life that are not easy for us.
[time=1674] And we're grateful, Father, that you have allowed us as a church and as a family to see some of the great works of God in this day and age.
[time=1683] We ask as we re-examine our calling and commitment to the ministries of this church, that you will fill us with thy spirit, that we might have his understanding and his insight into
[time=1694] the particular problem that we face at this time, for we pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1704] Ten years ago, almost when the Black Hawk Baptist Church was founded in the early days of its ministry,
[time=1711] I suppose, first of all, in my own heart, I made a commitment to God that I would not pastor an ordinary church.
[time=1719] I committed myself to the fact that if I was going to spend my life in the ministry of the Gospel, I wanted it to count for something beyond the ordinary.
[time=1728] I grew up among pastors and many of them, godly men, who served the Lord in difficult and hard places,
[time=1736] but I also met many along the way who were content just to meet the challenge of the day, go home at night,
[time=1744] and get up the next morning for the dull routine of life, and to spend their entire life maintaining the status quo
[time=1752] without any challenge or vision or faith for the future.
[time=1756] From the very beginning days of this church, it is operated on one principle, and that is that we do not touch the resources of God until we attempt the impossible.
[time=1766] We have operated on the fact that when we ask God to give us vision to accomplish great things,
[time=1772] he does that and then he supplies the need.
[time=1775] Five years ago, the Black Hawk Christian School came into being.
[time=1779] I do not believe we have ever struggled with any ministry in the early days as we struggled with that financially.
[time=1784] Every year, during the first three years of its ministry, we lost money, and yet God continued to bless it with new students and a qualified faculty so that today over 300 students are ministered to through the work of the Black Hawk Christian School and its excellent faculty.
[time=1800] One need only have walked into our building yesterday to see the excitement created by the sports program
[time=1806] as eight schools gathered here to participate in a tournament which our young men won.
[time=1811] The school has been an exciting ministry.
[time=1813] We have paid the price for its existence, and we continue to do it, and we shall in the future because we believe God for something exciting.
[time=1821] Four years ago, the television ministry was born.
[time=1824] It was born out of impossibility on the heels of an impossible offering.
[time=1829] It seemed as if there was no way it could happen, and yet God miraculously supplied the need for its birth,
[time=1835] and throughout the days of its existence, consistently, he has helped us meet the need that we face.
[time=1842] As our ministries have grown and buildings have been built and bond programs have been entered into,
[time=1848] we have seen God time after time meet the challenge that has been put before us as we have faced the impossible.
[time=1854] Just a few months ago, we entered into what we have called here the Together We Build program.
[time=1859] It was an exciting time in the ministry of our church.
[time=1862] As together, we committed ourselves to give over a million dollars to the future building program of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1871] We have experienced, as a church, what it means to be out in the great waters.
[time=1878] And we have taken our choice to move out into the challenging part of church growth and church life
[time=1886] and live where the waves are.
[time=1888] There are times when, as a pastor, I consider the possibility of tying our ship up to the shore
[time=1894] where I can jump out of the boat and get back to firm ground as quickly as I desire.
[time=1899] But a long time ago, we settled that question. We moved out away from the shore.
[time=1903] We got out into the waves.
[time=1905] We moved to where the challenge was in vision and in faith, believing that God would do for us what He promised to do.
[time=1912] We knew at the time we did it that there would be some challenges ahead.
[time=1916] Some danger, some testing, some tribulations, some trying of the soul.
[time=1920] We expected it, but somehow when it comes, it's not nearly as fun as we anticipate that it might be.
[time=1926] The Bible has a place for ministry where blessing exists.
[time=1932] It is not more graphically told in any other passage than it is in this one, where the Scripture says that they that go out into the deep waters to do business in great waters,
[time=1943] these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep.
[time=1948] The promise that God has given to us in our ministry of faith and vision is that when we get out where faith is necessary, God will meet our need and He will bless our ministry.
[time=1960] In the New Testament in the book of Luke and the fifth chapter, there's an interesting story of the disciples' fishing expedition.
[time=1968] As they fished and caught nothing, the Savior walked to them on the shore and He said to them, "Launch out into the deep for a drought of fishes." And the Scripture records that they did, and as they got out into the deep, the fish were plentyous and they caught a good catch.
[time=1985] We have taken the approach as a church that we would live on the area of faith
[time=1991] and do those things which were beyond the realm of possibility, humanly speaking.
[time=1998] When my wife and I came to Fort Wayne to be a part of the beginning of this church, we prayed a very simple prayer.
[time=2006] That prayer was that God would do something so wonderful in the midst of us that no one but God could get the credit, and He has indeed done that.
[time=2015] We all like to know about the great works and the great blessing of God upon a ministry.
[time=2021] We enjoy the positive things, but we must read on in this chapter to understand that God has also promised some other things along the way.
[time=2031] We read that these who see the works of the Lord also have some experiences that are interesting.
[time=2036] For the Lord commandth and raise at the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof, they mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths, their soul is melted because of trouble, they reel to and fro, they stagger like a drunken man, they are at their wits end.
[time=2054] I was considering the other day the ministry of this church, and though we have had some bumpy places along the way, this church has faced very few problems.
[time=2062] We have had a joyous experience of blessing with very little testing on the part of the Lord of this ministry.
[time=2069] We are facing some things right now that will cause us to trust the Lord as we never have before.
[time=2076] During the days of the Together We Build program, we put aside every emphasis within this church that we might emphasize the importance of our new building.
[time=2087] It was because of that single vision that God enabled us to do what we did in the committing of that amount of money to His work.
[time=2095] But during that time in the year, we normally would have had two special television fundraising projects
[time=2101] which are necessary for the television ministry to succeed.
[time=2106] During that time, we would have had an all-out effort to increase the support
[time=2112] to our school in our annual face banquet.
[time=2116] And shortly after that time, we would have entered into our annual stewardship campaign
[time=2122] in the month of January.
[time=2124] Because of the emphasis on the Together We Build program, we did not do any of those things.
[time=2129] And so the result is that we had a very successful Together We Build campaign, but all of those other ministries began to hurt.
[time=2137] We have tried the best we could to deal with that problem administratively.
[time=2142] We had a low-key stewardship emphasis during the month of January.
[time=2147] We have discovered something at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2150] You don't do anything here, low-key.
[time=2152] Everything we do is above that, and we can't just say, well, we're going to do it low-key.
[time=2157] We might as well not do it.
[time=2159] The result of all of these problems have brought us to the present place where we are experiencing the storms that I want to talk to you about today.
[time=2168] During the days of the Together We Build program, when all of us here were working diligently to meet the need of our buildings, we left some of those other things to be done later, and we woke up one day to see our television ministry in serious difficulty.
[time=2182] In fact, it is so serious at this time that if within the next few days we are not able to recover financially, we will be canceling some stations.
[time=2190] That is not an idle threat, nor it is a crisis statement.
[time=2193] It is the absolute truth. We don't have any other choice.
[time=2196] We cannot endanger our credit rating with these institutions because of the lack of funds.
[time=2202] When this problem first became apparent to me, I was speaking in a Bible conference in another part of the United States, and I had talked with our business manager on the phone.
[time=2211] He explained to me what had happened, and I'll have to be honest with you.
[time=2214] My first thought was, who needs it?
[time=2217] I said, "Lord, I could make four or five phone calls and chop off the problem right now
[time=2223] and get rid of it, send it out to sea, float it away. Who needs it?
[time=2227] Who needs the television ministry in its $5,000 commitment every week?
[time=2231] Who needs the problem?" The Lord spoke to my own heart that perhaps before I did anything rash, I better do some investigation.
[time=2239] So I went back as if I were starting all over again to examine what was involved in the Ministry of Television.
[time=2246] I was astounded to read some things I'd never read before.
[time=2250] I learned some amazing things about the Ministry of our outreach.
[time=2254] I learned that because of what God is doing in television, we are reaching a segment of society that has nothing else to reach out to, but that which comes to them through media.
[time=2266] A recent research project pointed out that the average adult over 18 years of age spends 47.7 hours watching television and listening to the radio.
[time=2275] Two days out of every week devoted to media.
[time=2279] Research by the National Religious Broadcasters Association tells us that there are 130 million people in our country who listen or watch religious programming on radio and television.
[time=2291] In an average week, 40% or 47% of the American people turned their dial to a religious program of some nature to listen, and that is opposed to only 42% who regularly attend church.
[time=2304] In 1978, an estimated $500 million was spent on religious broadcast time.
[time=2312] There are now 25 religious stations who are broadcasting the gospel by radio in the United States. I mean by television in the United States, there are over a thousand radio stations that are devoted to Christian broadcasting.
[time=2324] Then I began to remember some of the problems that people pointed out to me about the media ministry. Some of the perils, some of the difficulties we need to be aware of.
[time=2336] You cannot understand how many people there are who try to talk you out of doing what God tells you to do. Every week we get a letter from somebody who has heard directly from the Lord that we are not in His will.
[time=2348] And all of the things that they bring up about the television ministry are problems which we are very much aware of. There is in the media ministry throughout the United States a compromise of financial honesty.
[time=2360] There are many ministries that do not deal honestly with the truth as it relates to their finances. Some who reap great profits from the media ministry for other things they are doing. Let me say to you that never in the history of the Bible hour have we ever been able to reap any profit for any other ministry. When we say we have a crisis believe me, it is a crisis. It is not a gimmick to get additional money.
[time=2384] There are people who do that but it doesn't affect us if we don't do it.
[time=2388] Sometimes I have heard people say that the television ministry, in fact a good friend of mine, a noted Bible teacher recently in an article in the Moody Monthly said that the media ministry was nothing more less than the cultivation of Christian celebrities.
[time=2404] And I understand that that is a problem but that is not the only way Christian celebrities can be cultivated. And it is a terrible temptation for us when we see the misuse of a instrument of God to then decide that because it is misused we should throw it all out the window and forget about it. Even if it happens to be one of the most powerful tools God has brought into being for the communication of his word.
[time=2428] As we look out upon the media ministries in our country today we see a great emphasis upon it in certain groups. The charismatic certainly have seen the need of it. As I did the research to discover what was happening in media I learned that the Christian broadcasting network is on 130 commercial stations. By the way that is the same number of stations as the ABC television network. They are on over 4,000 cable systems. Robertson of CBN plans a fourth network in the next few months and already $50 million has been set aside so that there will be another major fourth network coming out of that organization. The holiday ends of America just announced that they have contracted with CBN to provide programming for 500 holiday ends across the country.
[time=2476] Special microwave antennas will be installed at each hotel in the program sent to each room by cable. Metro media a major independent U.S. television group recently sent a group from WTTGTV in Washington D.C. to do a report on CBN. They called it television's latest phenomenon. They said that Pat Robertson is heard by more people in the world than any other human being. We are told that Oral Roberts television programs are heard by 62 million people worldwide. PTL, another charismatic network buys 7.4 million of air time each year.
[time=2516] You add to that the fact that even Garner 10 Armstrong, who makes no claim to be a biblicist, is heard on 300 television stations or was until his recent demise and is anticipating going back on the air as soon as he can put it back together.
[time=2532] Last year the Church of God out of which Garner 10 Armstrong operates netted 65.4 million dollars through their media ministry.
[time=2544] Now what does all that information mean? That information means that other people are using the media and you know what we do as evangelical fundamental Bible believing churches.
[time=2556] We sit back and criticize the way they're doing it.
[time=2560] We point our finger at the parts of their doctrine that we don't like and we're critical of it. And yet you name how many Bible teaching fundamental ministries there are on television that are simply trying to declare the Word of God and you can do it on the fingers of one hand if you happen to know what's going on throughout the entire United States.
[time=2580] There is a place and a need for the ministry God has given us in the teaching of the Word of God through television. Because we do not fall prey to some of the gimmicks and some of the problems and some of the difficulties that find their way into these other ministries because we refuse to be hucksters of the gospel, we often experience problems that other ministries don't experience because we refuse to take that step beyond what we believe to be in keeping with the dignity of God's word.
[time=2612] You can understand as you deal with these facts why it would be easy for us just to say who needs it. Let's forget about it.
[time=2620] There are some who tell us that the ministry of media is in conflict with the local church, not too long ago in an article written by Martin Marty who is not known for his evangelical fervency.
[time=2632] He said that the average person walks down to his living room on Sunday morning and turns on his TV and he sees all of the pomp and circumstance of the television ministry and do you think he's going back down to his local church ever to attend church again and he criticizes media because it takes people away from their local churches. Yet if he were a member of this church he would know that full 50% of the people who come to this church to become a part of this ministry come here because they saw the television program and they recognized there was an option to the liberalism that is so rampant in many of our churches today. I have in my files a letter to the editor of the Moody Monthly written by one of our men where he took exception to Martin Marty's article and told him that he was in this church because the Bible hour reached him.
[time=2680] One of the problems that is faced often in the media ministry is what I might call the cause and effect syndrome, pragmatism. One of the things we must always be alert to as we operate in the areas of television and radio is that we not do just what works not too long ago and I heard a major broadcaster at the NRB say that he made it his major purpose on Sunday mornings never to mention the Bible because it was offensive to people and his whole program of operation was never to preach from the word of God. He used as his by line that God had not called him to narrow cast but to broadcast and so he would never do anything that would be narrow. As God is my witness I have never once ceased nor have I even flinched at saying even on television what I would say to you if there were no cameras in this auditorium because I am not out to broadcast if that means bringing in the boundaries of the truth or letting them out.
[time=2736] The credibility of reality is also sometimes looked at as a fault in the television ministry and I could go on and I want to tell you that I have done my homework I have looked at every single problem there is in this ministry and I've asked God you give me an excuse for cutting it off. You just give me five reasons or two or maybe even one and I'll be glad to let go of it you brought it here you dumped it in our lap and you tell us you don't want it and I'll let it go. And all he has done even in spite of the problem is to reconfirm to me that this is something God has wrought. This is something he has brought to us and we must meet the test and the challenge of it.
[time=2772] This week a letter is going out to all of our friends reminding him of the need that we have. It is the most desperate television need we have ever had. It is coupled with the church need that I'm going to talk to you about in a few moments after we're off the air. And together those two needs have brought us to a place of desperation in our own outreach of the gospel which needs to be met by faith. Now the Scripture tells us in this passage that we read a few moments ago that there are problems, that there are waves, that there are difficulties. One of the things that I find myself doing often when problems come is resisting them. I don't like problems. I heard a story the other day about a little boy who was born and who up until the age of four didn't talk. Nobody could understand why he didn't talk. They took him to the doctor, they took him to all of the specialists and they couldn't find out why he wouldn't speak. One morning he came down to breakfast and his mother put in front of him a hot dish of cereal. He took one bite and he said, "Ouch, that's hot." His mother said, "Johnny, I'm so excited that you spoke. But why haven't you spoken all of these years?" He said, "Well, up to now everything's been alright." That's the way a lot of folks are.
[time=2848] You know, as long as everything's okay, then it's alright. They don't get involved. But boy, you let there be a problem and all of a sudden there's a reaction.
[time=2856] And I can assure you that because we have a problem, there'll be some who won't respond to it positively. Let me teach you what the Bible has to say about need.
[time=2864] One of the things God has done in my own heart is I have personally faced the dilemma that we have right now is to recognize that God's supply is directly proportionate to our need. But my God shall supply all of your need. If we don't have any needs, we don't need God's supply. Over and over again I have been reminded that even in nature need and supply are related. We have heat because there is cold. We have light because there is darkness.
[time=2892] We have good because there is evil. The Bible says, "My God shall supply all your need." And though I don't know how he's going to supply this present need, I do know that because of the magnitude of the need we can depend upon God to supply at that level. The church that Jesus was most severe with in the book of Revelation is quoted as saying, "I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing." There is a tendency as a church grows and it multiplies its ministry and its people for them to come to the place where they say, "I am rich and I have increased my goods and I have need of nothing." And the Lord took that church and pointed his finger at him and he said, "Thou knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." Throughout the Old Testament it is consistently pointed out that when there is need God meets. Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress Psalm 4 verse 1.
[time=2952] I called upon the Lord in distress and the Lord answered me and set me in a large place Psalm 118 and verse 5. Over and over again the Bible tells us that when we have a need God is anxious to supply.
[time=2968] I think all of us when we face the needs that we have in our own lives have to work through becoming positive toward it.
[time=2976] I have to weigh our needs against the blessings that God has poured out upon us through the ministry of television that he's given to us as a church. The blessing relates to the fact that over the past year we have had the opportunity of responding in 10,000 letters to the needs people have written to us about through television. We have sent out over 5,000 books and pamphlets and pieces of literature to encourage people in their homes. The recent NRB and ARB ratings tell us that through our television ministry we're touching the lives of over 40,000 people each Sunday. I don't know any way through the ministry of the local church we could do that apart from that which God has given to us and I am confident that because he has given this ministry to us and has promised to care for it he will meet the need. Now what is going to be necessary for that need to be met? First of all it's going to be necessary for every one of us to examine our own hearts and see what we can do to meet that need. In a few moments I'm going to talk to those of you here in the auditorium about the need and how it can be met on the local level.
[time=3044] I have been searching my own heart. As many of you know I made a very heavy commitment to the Together We Build program.
[time=3052] God has given me three years to meet that commitment so I have a little time and I'm going to see what I can do to be a part of healing this need.
[time=3060] There has not been any evil done on the part of anyone.
[time=3064] We have simply tried to take the step of faith to get a new building and in the process these other things have happened. Had we maintained our regular course our regular program we would not have the need that we have today but it's here and God has allowed it to happen and we are in the midst of it and he wants to teach us something through it. Tomorrow morning I'm going to ask the men of our church to meet here to pray and we're going to pray specifically about this problem. On Wednesday we're going to ask you to pray throughout the day and come to the midweek service prepared to pray again as church family. As a staff we have made the provision to provide for all of the children of all ages in special prayer groups so that the adults can come to pray about that need as we meet before the Lord.
[time=3108] Saturday has been declared a day of prayer and throughout the day we are going to set aside segments of time where people can come to pray specifically for our need and on the next Lord's day we're going to receive an offering here to try to meet that need as it relates to our local ministry and the outreach of television. We're going to ask that people here in this congregation and all of those who are hearing my voice make a special effort to be of help at this time. God has led us experience and needs so that he can demonstrate to us his supply of that need and the psalmist who wrote 107 wrote that when God makes the storm and the waves are great and we reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man yes even are at our wits end that the thing we're supposed to do is cry unto the Lord and when we cry unto the Lord in our trouble he will bring us out of our distress and he will make the storm a calm and the waves thereof still he will bring us out of our distress into our desired even. I have come to the place in my own life strange as it may seem where I can thank God for this problem. I think it's good for us no we haven't created it on purpose but it is good for us as a congregation. It reminds us that those so many things have been good for us there are problems we need to meet together I am confident that as we pull together as a congregation and the many who are a part of our ministry outside of the walls of this church God will bring us together in a very special kind of unity as this need is met as this problem is handled. I read not too long ago some information that encouraged me about problems I read that in the darkness of the Bedford jail the morning dawn of pilgrims progress was born it was out of that darkness of the jail that the allegory that has blessed the hearts of so many people came to be and has gone over the world and has ministered down through the ages it was the darkness of the vartburg castle into which Luther was thrust that made the light of the German translation of the bible it was the darkness of calvary with its broken heart and its sin bearing that makes the light of salvation in of heaven. God knows how to make the morning out of the light and he can touch the black charcoal into diamonds he knows how to speak the darkness and it becomes light the very problem that would drag us down often lifts us up the things that are weight become wings and that which if you could you would have prevented lifts you up to heaven a few days ago I was with my good friend Tim LaHaye we were talking about some of the problems of the ministry when people involved themselves in a ministry of vision and Dr. LaHaye said something to me I'll never forget he said remember David that the doors of opportunity always swing on hinges of opposition and if we don't ever have any problems we can never open up the vista to the new things God has for us that's been true in my own life I'm sure it will be true in your life already since this problem became known to us at the intensity of its need many good things have happened in my own heart and in the hearts of the people who are on our staff I believe that God will bring us through this so that the ministry will continue and I believe he's going to do a work in all of our hearts to make that possible and I'm going to ask that you pray and that you do all you can during these days to meet that need in your own life as God touches you by his spirit to be responsive and in doing it he will encourage and bless and strengthen us as we go forward together shall we pray father we pray that you will bless your word as it has reached out beyond the walls of this church to our many friends at home we recognize that many of them are dependent upon the ministry of thy word through this program and that as they listen today their hearts are open and many of them will do father what they can to make this program available to many others in the days ahead we realize that if we cannot stand the test of the problem if we cannot run with the footman we'll never be able to run with the horseman if we cannot see our way through the relatively easy problems we'll never be able to face the more difficult ones you've been sharing the Bible our with pastor David Jeremiah if as a result of this program you have made a decision about your relationship to Jesus Christ or some other spiritual matter we would like to send you some material which will help you please write to us and indicate the nature of your decision or if you have questions or comments regarding the bible hour please write to pastor David Jeremiah box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana zip code 46815 during this program pastor Jeremiah has shared with you the serious need that is now facing the bible hour you can help today with your prayer and financial support if you are on our mailing list you will be receiving a special letter from pastor Jeremiah explaining this need when your letter arrives and perhaps it already has it is vitally important that you prayerfully consider this very serious need your participation has never been more important the future of the bible hour is dependent on you if you appreciate this ministry we need to hear from you this week if you've not written to us before won't you please take a few minutes yet today to write and close the largest gift you can to help us meet this financial need our address is pastor David Jeremiah box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and when you write please be sure to mention the name of the station that you are watching speaking for pastor David Jeremiah this is Jack Gray inviting you to join us again next week at the same time for the Sunday morning service of the black hawk Baptist Church the bible hour has been made possible by the members of the founders club the founders club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach ministry it's not my church not the church of the staff it's our church it's our ministry it's what God has given to us we face a tremendous danger at this point in our in our fellowship you know what that danger is that danger is that as we look around at the multiple staff God has given us and their gifts as a counselor a senior citizens ministry a woman's ministry youth pastors and all the rest a congregation that in its early stages of growth and development
