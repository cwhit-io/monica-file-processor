[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=12] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=18] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geroma.
[time=23] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=62] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=70] One need only look at the front page of the daily newspaper to discover that the world in which we live
[time=78] is a world that is filled with pain and suffering and evil,
[time=84] included in all of that are murders and child abandonment, beatings and rape and all of those ugly things
[time=90] that so capture the attention of the front pages of most major newspapers.
[time=98] These things demonstrate to us that man as an individual is capable of some of the most unbelievably sinful acts.
[time=108] When we couple with this the natural tragedies that are becoming more frequent these days such as earthquakes,
[time=114] tidal waves, tornadoes, famine and war, all of these facts together cause many people to ask why.
[time=124] That is especially true among Christians. For whether we like it or not they suffer along with the rest.
[time=132] They are included in much of the difficulty along with those who don't know Christ.
[time=138] And sometimes it seems as if Christians suffer even more.
[time=146] Because along with all of these things they bear the reproach of Christ.
[time=152] How do you explain that? And what does the Bible have to say about that problem?
[time=158] Well it does have something to say about it.
[time=162] And I'm excited to be able to share that with you in a few moments as we open the Word of God together.
[time=166] But first of all we have planned some exciting music to bless and encourage your heart.
[time=172] Our special guests today are Ray Felton and Claire Hess and they're going to be singing in a few moments.
[time=178] Right now we listen to the choir as they sing a beautiful anthem for us entitled "Declare His Glory."
[time=208] Glory the heavens, glory the heavens, glory the heavens, glory the heavens.
[time=218] Declare his glory along that evening, His wonders along the kingdom, glory is changed, and make you replace it.
[time=228] Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.
[time=240] Strength and beauty are in this sanctuary.
[time=250] Give unto the Lord, only give rid of the people.
[time=256] Give unto the Lord, glory to unto His name.
[time=266] Give unto the Lord.
[time=320] Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on.
[time=336] Give unto the Lord.
[time=398] I came home from a tobogganing trip with one of our adult fellowship groups yesterday just in time to see the most boring final game of any tournament I've ever watched.
[time=418] For our fellows won the final of the Association of Christian Schools Tournament 41 to 16.
[time=426] In fact, they were so far beyond any of the teams that they played that most of the first five didn't get to play more than half of the games in the tournament.
[time=434] But in spite of that, two of them were selected to the all tournament team, Matt Hicks.
[time=440] Matt, raise your hand so they can figure out who you are.
[time=442] And Todd Oren, he's down here in front.
[time=444] Todd, where are you?
[time=446] All right, these two young men were all tournament team selections.
[time=448] Just reminds us that we've got some exciting days ahead in our high school program.
[time=452] The high school team is doing well, and I'd want to also acknowledge the fellow who has been the architect of this winning combination.
[time=460] His name is Dale Wright, and I think might be a good idea for you to raise your hand too, Dale.
[time=470] I think we ought to express to him again how much we appreciate him.
[time=472] Thank you very much.
[time=480] Our athletes have participated in a number of tournaments this year, and I would like to recognize them every time, but we'd have somebody up here every day because we've got a group of winners, and they like to come home with the bacon, and I appreciate their winning spirit.
[time=494] We're so happy to have with us in our service today two delightful men who have been gifted of God in a wonderful way and sharing the ministry of the Word of God in music.
[time=504] Their names are Ray Felton and Claire Hess. They're known to many of you through their ministry of music in various and sundry places.
[time=512] We're glad to have them here for the very first time as a singing duo in our church.
[time=516] We remember with great to fondness the Ray Felton family.
[time=520] Ray and his family have been here a number of times, but we're grateful for this duet team.
[time=524] I know they're going to bless your hearts as they sing for us now.
[time=528] All praise to Him who reigns above in majesty supreme, who gave his son for man to die, that he might man redeem.
[time=550] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=568] His name of our name shall stand exalted more and more.
[time=578] Let God the Father's own right hand, where angel hosts adore.
[time=588] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=608] Blessed be the name.
[time=612] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=626] I want to express my appreciation to all of you who have joined us on the Bible Hour Network today to share this service from the Black Hawk Baptist Church Convocation Center.
[time=642] And I especially appreciate the many of you who have become a part of our Founders Club and those of you especially of recent date who have joined that great family.
[time=652] It is because of your concern and help that we're able to bring this television program to you each week.
[time=658] We thank you, and we trust that you will not only continue to support us with your finances, but with your prayers.
[time=664] For we're convinced that without the prayers of God's people, this program doesn't have a chance, and we're grateful for the many of you who stand with us and praying for the Bible Hour every day.
[time=674] During this time, as we talk together with those of you at home, we have the opportunity of sharing some Bible study helps that we're very excited about.
[time=682] And I'm going to ask Donna if she'll take just a moment and explain to our many friends the special Bible study help that is our gift offer this month.
[time=692] We've been offering this book for a number of times now, and each time I think we won't get much response from it this week.
[time=700] But more and more people are writing in to receive their copy of the Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=706] And it's really a helpful Bible study tool if you are studying the New Testament.
[time=712] What it does, it takes the life of Christ and the Four Gospels and arranges it together as a single narrative on that particular portion of the Scripture
[time=720] so that if you're studying the life of Christ and you want to study about His miracles perhaps, those are all arranged together as they happened
[time=728] so that you don't have to search back from Matthew to Mark to Luke and back to Matthew. They're all right there together.
[time=734] And if you would like to have your free copy of the Four Gospels, we would ask for you to write to us.
[time=740] And all you need to do is write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=748] The zip code is 46815. That's Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne.
[time=758] Thank you, Donna, and I'm sure many of our friends will be writing to us this week to request this special book.
[time=764] It's free, postage paid. When you write to us, it is our privilege to send it your way.
[time=772] Now before we go back to the morning service and enjoy some more music from our special guests and then look into the Word of God,
[time=780] I want to take just a moment to ask your special prayer and support during this time.
[time=786] In just a few days, many of you will be receiving a letter from me.
[time=790] Some of you perhaps have already received it in the mail. Since we send out so many letters, they don't all go out the same day.
[time=796] And some of you probably have already received a special letter from my desk.
[time=800] In the past, we have tried our very best to avoid sending out appeals for funds.
[time=806] It would be our best desire if we could just send this television program into the homes of all of our many people without ever making any request for assistance.
[time=816] We find ourselves again in a very special place, in a very desperate time of need,
[time=822] and we have nothing that we can do except to go to those who are part of our great family and ask for their help.
[time=828] I have done that in this letter. I want to ask that when you receive this letter in your home that you sit down and prayerfully consider what you might be able to do to help the Bible hour at this time.
[time=840] There are very few television programs that major on the teaching of the Word of God.
[time=846] We do not spend any time during the regular hour of our telecast, appealing for funds or promoting our own program,
[time=854] because it's our purpose simply to open the Word of God and teach its truths in order that it might be a blessing to your heart and to your life.
[time=862] But we must be realistic about the fact that the same financial needs that every television ministry faces we face.
[time=870] And whether we appeal for funds or not, we must meet the same challenges of staying on the air in every market where our telecast is seen.
[time=878] I'm going to ask that many of you take the time to perfectly consider what you might be able to do for the Bible hour at this time.
[time=886] We need some of our friends to do a considerable amount to give at the level of sacrifice.
[time=892] And I know that listening to this telecast today, there are many people who could do something extremely good for the Bible hour during these days,
[time=900] some who could give a large gift to help at this time.
[time=904] As you pray about it, and God lays it upon your heart to do it. Why not do it?
[time=908] Perhaps you could do it even before you get your letter.
[time=912] But most of all, when you receive the correspondence from my desk, will you carefully read it and perfectly consider what you can do?
[time=918] We're counting on you to help at this time.
[time=922] We don't want to do anything to diminish the quality or the outreach of the Bible hour.
[time=926] We're committed to the fact that God has brought us to this place for such a time as this.
[time=932] And we know that many of you will stand with us in this need.
[time=936] I'm going to pray this week that God will lay it upon your heart to stand with us in this hour.
[time=942] Now as we go back to our morning service, I'm going to be preaching from the Book of 1 Peter.
[time=948] And I'm going to be talking about the subject of why it is that Christians experience tragedy and suffering.
[time=956] Though you may not have experienced it yourself, certainly you know some who have.
[time=960] A very perplexing question and yet a question again that the Bible has answered.
[time=966] And I trust you'll stay with us as we open the word in a few moments to share together this wonderful truth.
[time=972] May God bless you as you share this hour with us today.
[time=990] May God bless you as you share this world.
[time=996] May God bless you as you share this love with us today.
[time=1012] [MUSIC]
[time=1022] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1026] Now our guests are coming again.
[time=1028] It's really a joy to have them with us this morning.
[time=1030] Mr. Ray Felton and Mr. Claire Hess.
[time=1034] You listen as they minister to our hearts now through music.
[time=1036] [MUSIC]
[time=1046] I hope is in the Lord who gave himself for me and paid the price for all my sin at Calvary.
[time=1062] For me he died for me he lived and everlasting light and life.
[time=1074] He freely gives.
[time=1080] And now for me he stands before the Father's throne.
[time=1090] He shows his wounded hands and names me as his own.
[time=1098] For me he died for me he lived and everlasting light and life.
[time=1110] He freely gives.
[time=1118] His grace has planned it all to his mind but to believe.
[time=1126] And recognizes work of love and Christ we see.
[time=1134] For me he died for me he lived and everlasting light and life.
[time=1146] He freely gives.
[time=1158] Our hope is based upon the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary.
[time=1164] Ray and I consider it a real privilege to be in your fellowship this morning.
[time=1168] And we look forward to the ministry of the Word as we gather in fellowship around the Word of God.
[time=1172] Day by day we as Christians learn to put that faith into practice.
[time=1178] We learn to walk by faith and less by sight.
[time=1182] And though sometimes the way ahead is not at all clear or certain,
[time=1188] we put our confidence in the Word of God where it says, and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
[time=1198] We'd like to draw back the curtain and see what lies ahead.
[time=1200] But if we did that we wouldn't trust him as much and he's teaching us to trust him more.
[time=1218] If we could see beyond today as God can see, if all the cloud should roll away the shadows feed.
[time=1236] Our present griefs we will not fret, each sorrow we would soon forget.
[time=1248] For many joys are waiting yet, for you and me.
[time=1264] If we could know beyond today as God of no,
[time=1274] why there is treasures pass away and tears must flow,
[time=1284] and why the darkness leans to light, why dreary days will soon grow bright.
[time=1296] Someday light throngs will be made right, faith tells us so.
[time=1324] If we could see, if we could know we often say,
[time=1332] but God in love availed a throw across our way.
[time=1342] We cannot see what lies before, and so we cling to him the more.
[time=1358] He leads us till this life is all, trust and obey.
[time=1382] Thank you for your ministry to us, Ray and Claire, and we look forward to hearing the continued ministry of these two men
[time=1390] they share with us and the other service today here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1394] We open your Bibles with me to the first book of Peter, 1 Peter 4.
[time=1404] And I want to begin my reading at the 12th verse of 1 Peter 4.
[time=1412] 1 Peter 4 verse 12.
[time=1416] Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you as though some strange thing happened unto you,
[time=1426] but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed,
[time=1432] ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[time=1436] If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.
[time=1440] For the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you, on their part, he is evil spoken of, but on your part, he is glorified.
[time=1450] But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busy body and other men's matters,
[time=1456] yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.
[time=1464] For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God, and if it first began at us, what shall the end of them be that obey not the gospel of God?
[time=1474] And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?
[time=1480] Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator.
[time=1490] Our Father, we ask that your blessing will be upon your word.
[time=1494] We recognize that the human flesh involved in the communication of the Word of God has nothing to offer by way of blessing.
[time=1504] But oh, how thankful we are that the Word of God carries with it its own special promise that it shall not return unto the void,
[time=1514] but it shall accomplish the thing wherein to it has been sent.
[time=1518] May the Word of God have free course in our lives and in our hearts and our understanding during these moments.
[time=1524] We put from our minds, from our thoughts, the cares of other things that we might tune in on this special message from God's Word for our own benefit and encouragement in Jesus' name and for his sake.
[time=1540] [AMEN] Why do Christians experience tragedy? Why is it that Christians seem to be caught up in all of the bad experiences that take the world in tow?
[time=1560] C.S. Lewis has written a book entitled The Problem of Pain, and in the book he expresses perhaps more accurately the nature of this question than I could express in my own words.
[time=1576] He puts it in the language of the philosopher and he delves into the meaning of this question beyond the surface at the level where all good thinking must take place.
[time=1590] I quote, "If God were good, he would wish to make his creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty, he would be able to do what he wished, but the creatures are not happy, therefore God lacks either goodness or power or both."
[time=1614] That's the nature of the argument that many throw against Christianity. If God were a good God, he'd want everyone to be happy, and if he were a powerful God, he could make that come true.
[time=1628] But since all of God's people are not happy, God is either not good or not powerful, or he is not good or powerful.
[time=1638] Certainly those questions must have been going through the minds of the Hebrew Christians to whom Peter writes, for they were beginning to experience the throes of the Roman Empire and its persecution upon their Christian testimony.
[time=1652] They were being tried for their faith and ridiculed for their stand upon the tenets which they had come to embrace, and many of them newly found in the faith were beginning to question, "Why is it that all of these things are happening to me?
[time=1668] I am a Christian. I am supposed to have been born into a new life. I am supposed to be living in the new creation which is mine in the Lord Jesus Christ, and yet all of these things are happening to me, all of these tragedies, these difficulties have come into my life.
[time=1686] How is it that I experience this kind of an experience?" And so to these Hebrew Christians Peter wrote this epistle.
[time=1694] And his opening words of the 12th verse are indeed interesting. He said unto them, "Don't think it's strange when the fiery trials of life overtake you, as though some strange thing had happened unto you.
[time=1710] For this is what is to be expected, and then in the rest of the text he goes on to expound the reason why as Christians we ought to expect difficulties and trials and hard times."
[time=1724] Will you notice with me, first of all, in this text that this is a new section that is beginning with, in essence, the 12th verse.
[time=1734] This 12th verse begins a new section of 1 Peter which concludes over in the 5th chapter and verse 11.
[time=1744] This passage of Scripture is addressed to Christians as is evidenced by the use of the word beloved.
[time=1752] Peter is writing to born again people, men and women who know and love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1758] He is renewing their confidence in God and in his word as the solid rock upon which they are to rest their faith in difficult times.
[time=1768] He is teaching them the importance of patient endurance and steadfastness in the midst of persecution.
[time=1778] First of all, in the text we need to understand that this was a real experience of suffering. So will you notice with me first the experience of suffering as it is here described?
[time=1788] In the 12th verse he said, "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you."
[time=1798] Now, there are two things about this statement we need to understand. First of all, this was not a trial that was soon to come upon them, but this was a trial they were already experiencing.
[time=1808] The text, as it is clearly translated, says that the trial was already upon them. They were in the midst of it. They had started to experience the suffering.
[time=1818] And into this context Peter writes these words of encouragement. They are in the midst of difficulty. I am certain that as I speak today there are some Christians listening to my voice who right now are living in the midst of some very tragic and difficult experiences
[time=1834] who are experiencing suffering at the very level of their being. And so to you I would say these words from Peter come to you in the midst of your suffering, in the midst of your experience, hopefully with a word of encouragement.
[time=1850] Not only was this a present experience of suffering, but the Scripture is also very clear about the severe nature of their trial.
[time=1858] Peter uses a word here to describe their trial. It is the word fiery, the fiery trial in which you find yourselves.
[time=1868] Now that word is translated over in the book of Revelations by the word furnace. It is translated again in the book of Revelation by the word burning.
[time=1876] Peter says you people are experiencing a trial, a difficulty, a sorrow that is so intense that the only way I can describe it is to describe it in terms of fire and burning and being in the furnace.
[time=1892] It was a severe trial. He doesn't give us all the details and all of the nature of it. But one thing we can certainly learn from the 12th verse is that it was a present terrible experience that these Christians were having to whom the Apostle wrote.
[time=1908] And the trial was evidently a very general experience for he says this is a trial which is among you, or in other words that many of you are experiencing. It is in your midst. It is something that you all feel.
[time=1922] Sometimes as Christians we talk about trials and sufferings and difficulties, but in comparison to what these brethren were experiencing, we haven't touched the threshold of what it means to suffer.
[time=1934] Francis Shafer has said that one of the great tragedies of the present day ministry is that we have not taught our people about suffering and that we are going to stand in need of that truth in these days that are ahead.
[time=1946] Even the recent occurrences in our news in just the last few hours cause us to once again look at the horizon and realize that the day of the Lord is just around the corner.
[time=1958] These people were experiencing persecution and difficulty and trial for their faith. It was indeed a real experience of suffering. What was the cause of it?
[time=1968] Well, the second thing that Peter points out to the Christians was the explanation of their suffering. Why is it that they were suffering? Verse 14 says, you are reproached for the name of Christ.
[time=1980] These Christians bore the name of Christ and the trial was due simply to the fact of their association with the Master.
[time=1988] Over and over again we read in the Word of God that if we are to be associated with Christ we must be associated with Him in every aspect of His life included in that is the reproach of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2002] Verse 16 says, "They suffered as Christians." Now the word Christian is only found three times in the New Testament.
[time=2010] And there are some who believe that the word Christian was given to the believers or the people of the way by those who were their enemies. It was sort of a nickname.
[time=2020] It was sort of something they were called not necessarily in respect but to describe these people who were trying to be followers of Christ.
[time=2032] And so the word in this text may not have a good connotation. It may be a word which Peter used to remind them that he understood the reproach that they experienced for their testimony and the suffering and the difficulty that they were experiencing because of their belief in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2050] I could not help but think as I read this passage of Scripture that the word Christian has fallen into a great deal of disuse and disrepute. Everybody is a Christian these days.
[time=2062] And it has very little meaning in the context of our lives but in that particular day to be called a Christian would be similar to be called a religious fanatic today, someone who was a rabid follower of the truth.
[time=2076] Most of us seem to go out of our way to avoid such descriptions coupled with our lives but in that day they stood up for their faith and they suffered as Christians.
[time=2088] The explanation of their trial might be different than the explanation of our experience today. They were suffering because of their association with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2098] But as we move through the argument of this passage I am certain that you will understand that God often takes a special time to deal with his own through the ministry of suffering that he might teach them and purify them and make them to be all that he would have them to be.
[time=2114] It is encouraging to me as I trusted will be to you that Peter does not simply examine the experience of their suffering and give a brief explanation of their suffering but he spends a great deal of time in this text to encourage them in the midst of their suffering.
[time=2130] And his encouragement takes on basically three different approaches. First of all it is his desire to encourage them against disorientation.
[time=2142] He says in verse 12 don't think it's strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you.
[time=2150] One of the most difficult things for Christians who suffer is the very fact of their suffering.
[time=2156] The very incomprehensible nature of the fact that as Christians they are experiencing this in their own lives.
[time=2162] And thanks to a number of teachers that are running loose upon the Christian kingdom these days we have a great deal of help in exploiting the idea that Christians should never have any problems.
[time=2176] That they should always be free of any difficulty. All that's lacking is faith were told. If you just believe God enough your problems will go away.
[time=2184] But you and I both know godly devout Christians who are at a level of faith far beyond even our teachers who still experience some very difficult times in their lives.
[time=2194] In fact as I was contemplating this passage of Scripture I was reminded of something that has been impressed upon me over and over and over again.
[time=2202] Something that is very frightening to me and should be frightening to any who aspire to do anything for God of any magnitude.
[time=2210] And that fact is simply this that every man I know whom God has ever used in a signal way has gone through a period of trial and difficulty and suffering in his own life.
[time=2220] To the extent where he is marked by his suffering. Don't tell me that Christians don't suffer. The word of God does not teach that.
[time=2230] And when that doctrine is let loose upon the Christian kingdom it creates all kinds of psychotic problems that ten psychologists can never get straight.
[time=2240] The word of God teaches that it is proper and it is right and it is to be expected that Christians will experience problems.
[time=2250] And so he says these problems need to be understood in a positive way. Don't think it is strange.
[time=2256] Don't get, if I could use the vernacular, don't get blown out of the saddle by your problems.
[time=2260] And sometimes when the problems come to us they just seem to wipe us out and we don't understand it. We get disoriented.
[time=2268] I was in a Christian education conference this past week with a friend by the name of Roy Lowery who is very much involved in the Christian school movement.
[time=2278] And before one of his messages he got up and explained some of the things they had gone through during their last year of living since we had met the last time.
[time=2286] He talked about the loss of some of his loved ones. He talked about the suicide of a member of his staff at the school where he teaches.
[time=2296] He went into great detail to lay the groundwork for some of the things he had experienced over the past year. And then you know what he did? He held up the book and he said but I want to tell you through these experiences we have found the word of God to be sufficient.
[time=2310] Over in the first chapter of the book of 1 Peter in verses 6 and 7 Peter has already given to them an explanation for these trials.
[time=2320] And we read in first Peter chapter 1 verses 6 and 7 he said in this she greatly rejoiced though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold trials.
[time=2332] Notice that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[time=2346] The fiery furnace has the effect of melting the dross out of the life of the Christian.
[time=2354] It has that purifying effect which causes all of the impurities of our motivations and ambitions to be boiled out to the top so that the heavenly father can take the divine ladle and scoop them off the top and throw them away.
[time=2368] And what is left is the pure faith which he seeks to demonstrate.
[time=2374] So Peter says to these suffering Christians I want to encourage you don't be disoriented don't think it's strange.
[time=2380] God has a purpose in it he has a plan in it you may not understand it but he's working in your life and you accept that is his plan.
[time=2388] Secondly he tries to bring encouragement he tries to bring encouragement to their life that they be not discouraged.
[time=2400] Verse 13 he says these words rejoice are you kidding rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding great joy.
[time=2414] Take your Bibles and turn back to chapter 1 of 1 Peter.
[time=2418] Notice verse 11 searching what are what matter of time the spirit of Christ who was in them did signify when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ the glory which should follow.
[time=2432] Notice chapter 2 verse 21 for even here unto you were called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow after his steps.
[time=2444] Notice chapter 3 verse 18 for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God.
[time=2452] Chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.
[time=2466] What is Peter's point what is he making what is he trying to explain he is saying listen I don't want you to be discouraged I want you to rejoice because you're suffering has identified you with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ who suffered in your behalf
[time=2482] and you can rejoice and be a part taker in his sufferings you can know the fellowship of his sufferings which Paul desired to know you can be joined together in the fellowship the koinonia fellowship with the Savior through your suffering.
[time=2500] I want to encourage you he says don't be discouraged if you are in fellowship with your master that fellowship means that you will share in all areas of his life and included in that is the suffering and that has an attendant blessing back to your own heart as you realize the oneness that you have with the Savior.
[time=2520] Thirdly he wants to encourage them against the disdainment of his enemies of their enemies notice what he says in verses 14 and 16 he says I want you to know that you don't have to be ashamed.
[time=2538] If you be reproached for the name of Christ be happy for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your party is glorified verse 16 if any man suffers a Christian let him not be ashamed.
[time=2552] Doubtless there were times in the lives of these Christian brethren when they were tempted to be afraid and ashamed of their religion in the face of all the persecution that was around them.
[time=2562] To meet this possibility the apostle gives to them some good information he calls them first of all in verse 14 blessed earlier in the epistle he reminds them that they are happy they are blessed indeed if they experience the difficulties of life.
[time=2580] In verse 14 he reminds them that the spirit of glory and of God was already resting upon them I believe this is a picture of the Old Testament Shekinah glory of the tabernacle just as the Shekinah glory rested in a bite upon the tabernacle symbolizing the presence of the Lord among his people.
[time=2600] Peter says that through their suffering they experience that wonderful special presence of the spirit of God hovering over their lives as the Shekinah glory hovered over the tabernacle he said the spirit of God and of glory rests upon you.
[time=2614] That is another way of saying what so many who have suffered have said over and over again that through that crucible experience God taught me the presence of the Lord in my life in a way I never experienced it before.
[time=2626] When those difficulties came when the heat was on when the vise was tightened up and all of the ways of escape seemed to be gone and I was left alone with my faith in my God I learned that he was present in my life and I experienced his presence
[time=2642] and yes the Holy Spirit the God of glory hovered over my life in a special way and now I can say that I know my redeemer live with and that he is present in my life.
[time=2654] Is that not what Andre Crouch was trying to say in the song that has become probably his best known song through it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[time=2668] I've learned to trust in him and part of it goes like this if I had had no problems I'd never know known that he could solve them.
[time=2678] It is the experiences of suffering and God does that to Christians for a purpose.
[time=2684] He brings us into these experiences to teach us that we can trust him that we can rely upon him that there is no difficulty no problem that is beyond the scope of his ability to be with us and to help us and to encourage us
[time=2696] and when all help is gone and all avenues are closed we can still go to him and he is real and he is enough.
[time=2704] I have stood on occasion with people from this church family who have been in the midst of terrible suffering and sometimes the only thing I've been able to say is simply God is enough and he is.
[time=2720] And they often struggle through the midst of that to come out on the other side stronger in their faith to be able to say from experience.
[time=2726] That's right. God is enough. He is enough.
[time=2734] Peter goes on fourthly to share with them that this experience of trial is not the only thing to which they may look.
[time=2744] This passage is filled with expectation. May I share with you for just a moment the expectation of suffering.
[time=2752] Notice verse 13 first of all but rejoice and then it talks about his glory being revealed.
[time=2760] The glory of God being revealed. They are to look above.
[time=2766] Peter says look above. Look beyond your suffering to the glory that is to follow. Notice chapter 5 verse 1.
[time=2772] The elders who are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also our partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.
[time=2782] There is a special kind of glory that awaits those who are the experiencing ones now in the difficulties of life.
[time=2794] We look about us in a world that seems not to be touched sometimes with the difficulties that affect the Christians.
[time=2800] We wonder how in the world the wicked prosper so much.
[time=2804] Peter looks out beyond the present to the future and he points his finger at the fact that there is a coming day of glory.
[time=2812] And that though we may have experienced some difficulties and in the particular situation of this passage the experience of persecution for their faith.
[time=2820] There is a day we are looking forward to a day of glory.
[time=2824] I was reminded of this over in the second book of Corinthians chapter 4.
[time=2828] Quite often I turn to this passage because it is one of my favorite passages in the New Testament.
[time=2832] Second Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 17.
[time=2836] It puts it all into perspective.
[time=2840] It says for our light affliction which is but for a moment.
[time=2846] Worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[time=2854] Someone gave to me some weeks ago a slip of paper that had this verse written out on it in a little different way than we'd normally read it.
[time=2860] I think I can explain it to you by simply reading it the way it's written on the text.
[time=2866] Eternal weight of glory.
[time=2872] Exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[time=2884] You see that's what Peter holds out in front of the believer.
[time=2888] He says you may be experiencing this now but let me tell you something.
[time=2890] There's coming a time in the future when all of the sufferings that you have gone through in my name and for my name's sake will be as a light affliction because of the eternal weight of glory that is yours.
[time=2904] Because of your salvation.
[time=2906] Because of your redemption.
[time=2908] He also reminds them in chapter 4 verse 13 at the end of the verse that they can experience joy.
[time=2914] And that that joy which is theirs even in the midst of trouble will be translated and continue to grow until it will be an exceeding joy in the presence of the Savior when they see Him face to face.
[time=2930] In the next few verses of this text Peter makes a very simple point and I can just touch upon it as we pass over to the final exhortation that he gives.
[time=2940] He must have been living in a time very similar to ours for he wanted to make sure that no one misunderstood his explanation.
[time=2948] So he takes a few verses to tell us that there is a kind of suffering that some people experience that they confuse for Christian suffering which carries all of these admonitions along with it.
[time=2960] He says in verse 16 if you suffer as a Christian don't be ashamed but in verse 15 he says but don't let any of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a busybody and other men's matters.
[time=2978] In other words Peter saying some kind of suffering that Christians experience are just the result of their own sinful behavior and if you're in the midst of suffering because you've got your neck in a noose and somebody's pulling on the rope then don't you come to this passage for encouragement you go back to where you got out of the will of God and get back in.
[time=3000] My office is filled over periods of time with people who come to explain their suffering but it's suffering related to sin.
[time=3010] God doesn't have anything to say about that in this passage of scripture except don't let it happen.
[time=3016] If you're a Christian don't you suffer as an evil doer. Interestingly enough he places being a busybody and other men's matters in a very, very, very strong category doesn't he.
[time=3028] Murderers thieves puts it on a serious note that could be a sermon all by itself. I can feel the outline coming to me right now and I won't preach it.
[time=3046] Peter said there's a kind of suffering that comes because you're living for God in a Christian testimony and trials come in difficulties and God allows you to experience them and this passage deals with that but don't you get off on this other track.
[time=3058] And expect that that falls into the same category. Now let's look at the end of the text verse 19.
[time=3066] He says in verse 19 that this whole question of suffering for righteousness sake can cause us to come to a place of trust and commitment that we could never know through any other experience.
[time=3084] Verse 19 he says wherefore here's his closing exhortation let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to God in well doing as unto a faithful creator.
[time=3104] The condition for this exhortation is simple you must be suffering according to the will of God that once again is a reminder that some suffering is not in the will of God and this does not apply.
[time=3114] You cannot commit your soul to God if you're suffering is the result of your sin.
[time=3120] It also reminds us again of the point made earlier in this message that some suffering is in the will of God.
[time=3126] Don't let anyone tell you that if you suffer you're not in the will of God that is a direct contradiction of scripture some suffering is in the will of God.
[time=3140] And when you suffer in the will of God Peter says here's what you're to do you're to commit your soul a better rendering of the word commit would be the word deposit.
[time=3150] It means to deposit over and over it means to hand over your soul and then notice the term that he uses to describe the God to a what kind of God a faithful God hand over your soul to a faithful God.
[time=3168] It in essence says that in your mind in your spirit you come to the place where you say Lord I don't understand this situation I don't know how it fits into your plan for my life.
[time=3178] The trial and the burning and the furnace and the heat is almost more than I can handle but Lord I don't understand it I'm just going to give it to you.
[time=3186] Here it is I hand over my soul to you Lord it's yours whatever you want to do with it you do it.
[time=3192] I commit my soul to you because you are a faithful God who will not cause us to suffer anything that is not for our ultimate good.
[time=3206] When I was an associate pastor in Haddon Heights there was a young doctor in our church by the name of Christiansen who went to the mission field with the African inland mission.
[time=3216] He went as a single man but while he was preparing for his ministry there he met a young lady by the name of Elizabeth they fell in love and they were married.
[time=3228] During the first year of our marriage she began to experience some physical difficulties to make a long story short.
[time=3240] When they went to Switzerland for a weekend she became very ill they took her to the doctor and found that she had a very serious case of cancer.
[time=3254] And this poor doctor who had given his heart to the Lord for the mission field and had found a help me to go along with him and help him in the ministry was there ready to go and serve God with his life.
[time=3270] And he had to live through the experience of the sickness and death of his wife.
[time=3274] The story of that experience has been written in a book titled simply Elizabeth.
[time=3282] Dr. Warren Bivinghouse who was on the staff and board of ABWE is the uncle of this man and he sent me a copy of the book.
[time=3288] I stuck it in my travel case a couple years ago on my way to the west coast to speak and I began to read it on the airplane.
[time=3296] And I have to admit that even though there were people all around me I sat in the chair and just cried like a baby as I read the path off of that experience.
[time=3306] He struggled with the kinds of things we've been talking about this morning.
[time=3310] In closing I want to read just a section of the book that describes an experience he had when he went to the Luzon conference and heard Dr. Francis Schaeffer speak.
[time=3322] After he spoke according to the book David Christians and Rosen said how should we interpret so many verses like if you ask anything in my name believing it shall be done for you.
[time=3336] If God doesn't answer in a favorable way is this because we lack faith.
[time=3340] People say just claim healing claim it God says it so claim it in a sense that's what happens in salvation whoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved the Bible says it I call therefore I'm saved.
[time=3352] It's as simple as that taking God is word so the same argument goes for healing does it not.
[time=3356] God says you have not because you ask not okay I'm asking and God said it therefore she's healed but she really isn't.
[time=3364] Now what do you do with that.
[time=3368] Schaeffer answered that God does respond to our prayers and that he is not trying to manipulate us but in all of Schaeffer's explanations David wrote four words echoed with a ring of truth in his mind.
[time=3380] Let God be God.
[time=3388] And David found himself repeating the phrase let God be God and over and over again in the sorrow and agony of that experience the realization that God was in control held him until in victory he experienced the most bitter agony any human being can experience.
[time=3410] And today he can say with assurance I know that my Redeemer, and I know that he is sufficient for every experience in my life though that seems bad it's good.
