[time=11] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=21] [MUSIC]
[time=51] [ Singing ]
[time=71] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=76] The great hope of every Christian is the future we have with Christ in eternity.
[time=84] The Bible teaches that we are going to a place called heaven.
[time=88] It is a literal place where Jesus himself dwells and he is preparing for those who trust and love him a beautiful place where we shall enjoy his fellowship forever and forever.
[time=103] And today, in our service, we are going to be sharing together the theme of heaven.
[time=110] All of our music is on that subject and on that theme.
[time=115] And I'm going to be speaking in a few moments from the book of Revelation on the subject, what will heaven be like?
[time=122] I am confident that there are people gathered here in the auditorium and many who are watching at home who have already invested some in that place and have loved ones there who are with the Lord Jesus looking forward to eternity in his presence.
[time=138] Today, we're going to talk about the blessed abode of the believing Christian heaven.
[time=144] And I trust that as the music unfolds and as your heart opens to the truth, God will speak to you through his Holy Spirit.
[time=153] Listen now to the ministry of our Black Hawk singers as they begin to communicate the subject of eternity in heaven with God.
[time=173] When Jesus comes to ring the ring, the earth will sing
[time=185] redemption's story.
[time=191] Love of creation will ring with joyful cry.
[time=200] From every nation, a son of joy shall rise.
[time=209] There'll be no grief, there'll be no crying.
[time=226] There'll be a new world, all things will pass away in God's eternity.
[time=256] There'll be no grief, there'll be no crying.
[time=286] There'll be no grief, there'll be no pain, there'll be no dying.
[time=296] There'll be a new world, all things will pass away in God's eternity.
[time=327] The Black Hawk singers have been singing about some of the things we're going to experience in heaven.
[time=333] No grief, no sign.
[time=336] The Bible says tears will be washed away.
[time=339] It also tells us about streets of gold, beautiful place, pearly gates, but you know when I go home, it's not the things that attract me there.
[time=351] It's not the things that make home.
[time=354] It's the people, moms there, dads there.
[time=358] Well, heaven for us is going to be to meet our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=363] Our male duo now sings for us the beautiful song, "Face to Face with Christ, My Savior."
[time=394] I shall see Him by and by.
[time=401] Face to face with Christ, My Savior.
[time=412] Face to face what will it be.
[time=420] When with rapture I behold Him.
[time=426] Jesus Christ who died for me.
[time=434] Face to face I shall behold Him.
[time=441] For me on the star is gone.
[time=448] Face to face in all His glory.
[time=454] I shall see Him by and by.
[time=460] Face to face or bliss or moments.
[time=468] Face to face to see and go.
[time=476] Face to face with My leader, Jesus Christ who loves me so.
[time=490] Face to face I shall behold Him.
[time=497] For me on the star is gone.
[time=504] Face to face in all His glory.
[time=510] I shall see Him by and by.
[time=516] Face to face I shall behold Him.
[time=525] For me on the star is gone.
[time=534] Face to face in all His glory.
[time=541] I shall see Him by and by.
[time=564] Face to face I shall behold Him.
[time=619] And the Lord Himself will greet us.
[time=623] Oh, a joy will feel that day.
[time=627] When with a smile of the proudest Father,
[time=633] He'll look at us and say.
[time=645] This is a place I prepare for you.
[time=653] Welcome home, children.
[time=657] Now let your work on Him is through.
[time=662] Welcome home, children.
[time=668] We who have all odds of faith for you.
[time=675] Welcome home, children.
[time=682] Here where I am, you shall always be.
[time=688] Forever rejoicing with me.
[time=705] We who have all odds of faith for me.
[time=725] Welcome home, children.
[time=732] Here where I am, you shall always be.
[time=739] Forever rejoicing, forever rejoicing with me.
[time=762] Thank you for letting us be a part of your Sunday schedule
[time=768] and for allowing us this opportunity to come into your home with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=774] During this time in our service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, we're receiving the offering here in the Convocation Center.
[time=780] And it gives me the opportunity to talk with those of you who are watching at home and to speak directly to you about the needs we have and your part in this ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=790] Now normally during this time I'm joined by my wife Donna.
[time=794] Some of you know we've had some sickness in our home a few days ago.
[time=798] Our oldest daughter had her appendix out and was in the hospital for a few days.
[time=802] And then yesterday we thought maybe we'd all be in church again this Lord's day.
[time=807] My oldest son got a throat infection and he had the crook last night.
[time=813] Some of you who remember raising children know something about that.
[time=817] In fact when I asked him if he was feeling all right this morning he told me that his temperature was 200 degrees and I got that all straightened out.
[time=823] It's 102 but he's doing better and he's at home.
[time=826] And Donna of course has to stay home with the children.
[time=829] It's this time that we take usually the both of us and today just myself alone.
[time=835] To share with you the needs we have in the area of television.
[time=839] Some of you know that we have gone through and are going through some very difficult times as it relates to the television support.
[time=846] At the end of 1978 we were almost $70,000 behind in the support of television.
[time=853] I shared that with our congregation and with our television family just a few weeks ago and since that time God has done some very wonderful things.
[time=861] Let me share with you first of all that one of the good things that happens when we have needs is we discover how many people really care about what we're doing.
[time=869] From all over this area wherever the television ministry is heard and seen we have received letters from people who have said they're praying for us.
[time=877] Many have given to help during this time.
[time=880] I thought it would be interesting for you just to hear a couple of excerpts from some of the letters we've received. This letter came to us from here at Indiana and part of the letter the woman says I have two married sons both raised in a Christian home but one doesn't attend church now.
[time=895] He says that he listens to your television program every week.
[time=899] So I want you to know how very interested I am in the television ministry continuing.
[time=904] Many, many families are praying for the Bible hour because it's touching the lives of family members who are out of fellowship with God or perhaps unsaved not attending church.
[time=914] We got this letter from Lagrange Indiana. We watch your television program on Channel 21
[time=920] and we certainly want it to stay on the air.
[time=922] Unlike many other TV religious programs yours gives us a study of the Bible every Sunday.
[time=928] We look forward to it each week.
[time=930] I have many other such letters that I could read but let me just share with you that these letters represent to us that there are many hundreds of people who believe in what we're doing and who want to see the Bible hour continue in the area where they're able to see it.
[time=945] Now let me tell you what's necessary if we're going to be able to do that.
[time=949] At the present time as of this Sunday we have recovered approximately half of the deficit.
[time=955] That means that over $35,000 has come in through the mail in these last days.
[time=959] Now that's a very good start and we're excited about it.
[time=962] We thank God for everyone who's had a part but it also means that we still have a long way to go.
[time=968] It means that those of you who are going to wait and see whether or not the need would be met without you need to do what you can do now.
[time=975] I've had a special burden during the weeks of this crisis and especially during these past few days
[time=981] that God has someone someplace within the scope of the Bible hour ministry who is capable of doing something very sizable for this ministry.
[time=991] Most of the gifts that we get come from people who believe in what we're doing who love the Bible hour but are not capable of giving large gifts and it's the collection of many many hundreds of people
[time=1002] who give relatively small gifts that make the Bible hour continue on this station
[time=1009] and we're grateful for every single one of them and we thank God because we know that their gift represents their prayer ministry but we also recognize that there are some businessmen,
[time=1020] some individuals who watch the Bible hour regularly who are capable of doing something significant for the Bible hour during these days and I personally believe it's going to take some of you men perhaps some of you women who are capable of doing that if we're going to meet this crisis and come through it victoriously it takes all of us doing all we are capable of doing
[time=1041] to make sure that the Word of God goes out every week I want to ask you to consider carefully what
[time=1047] you might do for the Bible hour today. I don't have any feeling of apology in my own heart for asking
[time=1054] you simply because it's not for me I'm not asking for myself or for this church or for our staff
[time=1060] we're asking you to be involved because we believe that there are many hundreds of people who need the ministry of the Bible hour in their homes and in their families and we believe that God will honor your investment in eternity as you give as God enables you to do it. Now
[time=1075] why don't you sit down right now and take down the address and as God enables you this week sit
[time=1081] down and write me a letter and let me know that you want to be a part of the Bible hour and you're going to have a part in supporting its ministry during these days when we're counting on every single person to be involved when you write write to me pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250
[time=1100] Fort Wayne Indiana let me say it again pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne
[time=1108] Indiana write to me personally and enclose your gift when you write your check make it payable to the Bible hour it's tax deductible and we'll send you a receipt when we receive your gift we know that
[time=1119] there are many of you who are yet to write we're counting on you to do it this week and we're praying that God will enable you to do all you can possibly do for us during these days we want
[time=1129] to keep this program on your station we want to keep reaching the people that you know and love who are counting on this ministry we need your help and we're knowing that together as we trust God
[time=1142] and we join hands to keep this ministry alive God will meet our need as we pray together and trust
[time=1148] Him for it now in just a few moments I'm going to be opening the the Word of God and teaching from the
[time=1154] book of Revelation on what heaven will be like I'm certain that there are many of you watching the program today who have already invested some of your loved ones in heaven and maybe you've never heard a message about the nature of heaven and what it's going to be like and what it is like and I hope you'll have your Bibles ready so that we can study together from the 21st and 22nd chapter
[time=1175] of the book of Revelation on what heaven will be like we have some more music I know this is going to be a great time for you as you share this service with us today let me encourage you again that we need to hear from you this week post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana is the address why not
[time=1192] write to us today
[time=1223] thank you and you may be seated we're going to continue with our music with the theme of heaven
[time=1231] and Dave Miller comes now and tells us that Jesus is really what's going to make heaven for each one
[time=1237] of us who know him
[time=1267] that's called heaven my soul wants to be for where Jesus is it will be heaven for me
[time=1282] heaven for me
[time=1290] Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me all its beauty and wonders I'm longing to see
[time=1306] you for where Jesus is it will be heaven for me
[time=1320] if its walls were not jasper and its streets were not though if mansions should crumble
[time=1333] and if folks still grew old still I'd see everything I've been longing to see
[time=1344] for Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me for Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me
[time=1363] heaven for me
[time=1369] Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me all its beauty and wonders I'm longing to see
[time=1388] for Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me
[time=1406] Jesus will be yes Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me for Jesus will be
[time=1431] and Jesus was the one that said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would
[time=1438] have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come
[time=1445] again to receive you unto myself that where I am there he may be awesome the songwriter has
[time=1454] written I will home beyond the river
[time=1484] yes to not to pleasure I will home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by and by the home
[time=1501] I'm only on the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by
[time=1543] and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by
[time=1587] home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river that I'll enter by and by the home beyond the river.
[time=1605] I think we ought to express our appreciation for the music can we?
[time=1609] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1620] Don Kruger used to be a tenor and he had a cold and when he came out he ended up like what we heard today and that was great wasn't it?
[time=1628] Just appreciated so much and I've been listening very carefully to the words it's almost as if the message has been preached before we open the scripture how grateful I am for the biblical content of the music about heaven.
[time=1641] Let's take our Bibles and turn together to the book of Revelation and I want to read just the first few verses of the 21st chapter, Revelation chapter 21.
[time=1652] I hope you have your Bibles because we're going to study the Bible together and you'll need to see right in the scripture that this is not the words of a Baptist preacher
[time=1662] these are the words from God concerning that place where we are planning to spend eternity if we have made reservations in advance.
[time=1672] Revelation chapter 21 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea.
[time=1682] And I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, "Behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying,
[time=1711] neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away." Our Father in heaven we come into thy presence today recognizing that the awesome truth we're about to study is far beyond anything we could encompass in our imagination with the limitations of time that we have.
[time=1739] We recognize that if we had all of this life to envision the beauty of heaven we would not even touch one small portion of its beauty and yet what we do know about it from the scripture causes us to look forward with anticipation to that special place you have prepared for those that love you.
[time=1761] We ask our Father that you will open our hearts to the truth. We recognize that there may be some who hear my voice today, no doubt many, who do not have the assurance of eternal life and the absolute certainty of a heaven where they will be with their Savior.
[time=1778] We ask our Father that the message will be clear and the Spirit of God will apply it to our own hearts as we listen with expectancy in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1791] I have been amazed as I am sure you have with all of the interest as of late in life after death.
[time=1800] Almost every periodical that you pick up on the stands these days has some definitive statement to make about life after death.
[time=1810] Some months ago I read an article in our local newspaper about the fact that a grant had been given by a large foundation for the purpose of investigating whether there was indeed any life after death.
[time=1826] The problem with the disposition of the grant was that they could not decide whether to invest that money in the areas of science or in the areas of theology.
[time=1837] And after careful debate they discussed over and over again the possibilities of determining any truth.
[time=1844] They decided that theology wouldn't be much help, that they didn't want to talk to anybody who believed the Bible and so they invested their money in the area of science in order to demonstrate whether or not there was life after death.
[time=1857] I couldn't help but think as I read that article that there were two basic problems with that decision. First of all, they were asking science to investigate an area where you cannot use the scientific hypotheses in the same way that scientists are used to using it in the world in which we live.
[time=1873] The Bible says that we know these things by faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for, not the substance of things seen.
[time=1881] Scientists are used to taking data, putting it in a test tube, investigating it, evaluating it and coming out with an answer.
[time=1888] And that is a very good process and we're all grateful for scientists but we must recognize that there is some truth that can be known apart from science.
[time=1898] Another thing that crossed my mind was the fact that even if a scientist could demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that there was indeed a heaven, the probability is he would, if he did not know God, figure out some way to avoid the impact of that truth upon his life.
[time=1913] I remember reading some time ago the story of a man who thought he was dead.
[time=1918] His concerned wife and friends decided that he needed professional help and so they set him to the neighborhood psychiatrist.
[time=1926] The psychiatrist determined to cure him by convincing him of one fact which contradicted his belief that he was dead and that fact was that dead men do not bleed.
[time=1938] He put his patient to work reading medical texts, observing autopsies, etc.
[time=1945] And after weeks of effort the patient finally said, "All right, all right, you've convinced me, dead men do not bleed."
[time=1955] Whereupon the psychiatrist stuck him in the arm with a needle and the blood flowed.
[time=1960] The man looked down with a contorted ashen face and cried, "Good night, dead men do bleed after all."
[time=1970] When I read that story, I was reminded of the way so many people respond to spiritual truth.
[time=1977] It isn't a matter of whether they can be convinced of the truth or not.
[time=1987] Now, if you have come here today expecting that I am going to prove to you scientifically that there is a place called heaven,
[time=1994] then I have nothing that I can offer to you.
[time=1997] I have not seen it with my eyes, nor have I been there and returned.
[time=2002] But I have a body of revelation called the Bible which teaches dogmatically that heaven is not a state of mind,
[time=2010] nor is it the object of wishful thinking.
[time=2014] But heaven is a place which God has prepared for those that love him.
[time=2019] And so interested is God in our knowing about that place that he has given to us in the Bible a description of that place we call heaven.
[time=2029] It is described in the Bible as a place called the Holy City.
[time=2035] It is sometimes referred to as the New Jerusalem.
[time=2038] It is the heavenly eternal abode of those who put their trust in Jesus Christ.
[time=2044] It is a place according to the Scripture that is characterized by laughter without tears.
[time=2050] It is a place that is characterized by life without death, singing without mourning, contentment without crying, pleasure without pain.
[time=2062] Our loving heavenly Father is there.
[time=2065] The blessed Holy Spirit will be there, and the Lord Jesus Christ is seated upon the right hand of the Father in that resplendent city called heaven.
[time=2077] The book of the Revelation describes it for us.
[time=2080] We can only touch upon the salient features of its description.
[time=2085] It tells us first of all that it is a city which is a memorial to all that God has done throughout his work in this world.
[time=2094] In the 21st chapter of the book of Revelation beginning in the 12th verse we read,
[time=2101] "And it had a wall great and high, and twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on the gates which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel,
[time=2113] and the three east gates on the north three gates and on the south three gates and on the west three gates,
[time=2119] and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
[time=2125] And he talked with me, had a golden read to measure the city and the gates of it with its wall.
[time=2131] According to the Bible, the city of Jerusalem, the heavenly city is a place which has four square dimensions.
[time=2140] The Bible says that it has twelve gates which represent the twelve tribes of Israel of the Old Testament,
[time=2147] and it has twelve foundations which represent the twelve apostles of the New Testament, and attending it are twelve angels.
[time=2158] As one walks throughout the city of Jerusalem, the new Jerusalem, the place we call heaven, as one understands the nature of that city,
[time=2167] he will be reminded continually throughout eternity of the redemption of an almighty God who cared enough to provide that he could have such a place.
[time=2177] As he walks past the foundations and views there the memorial, the reminder of the ministry of the twelve apostles,
[time=2186] he will be reminded of the fact that it is the book called the Bible which records the words of these apostles,
[time=2192] which has been the means and tool of salvation which has made it possible for them to enjoy such a place.
[time=2198] He will think back through the Old Testament to all that God did, prefiguring his salvation through the Old Testament law as he remembers the twelve tribes of Israel.
[time=2209] Even the outward experience that man has in that place called heaven will be a reminder of his redemption,
[time=2216] and he will, throughout eternity, be giving thanksgiving to the Lord for providing him with such a place.
[time=2224] According to verses 15 through 17 of this chapter, it is a city four square,
[time=2230] and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates of it in its wall.
[time=2235] In the city life four square, the length is as large as the breadth, and he measured the city with a reed, twelve thousand furlongs,
[time=2242] the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
[time=2246] I remember as I was growing up that we used to sing a song in the churches where my father pastored, and the words of the song went like this, "In the land of fateless day lies the city four square.
[time=2259] It shall never pass away, and there is no night there.
[time=2264] God shall wipe away all tears, there's no pain, no death, nor fears, and they count not time by years, for there is no night there.
[time=2274] And all the gates are made of pearl in the city four square, and the streets with gold are laid, and there is no night there, and the gates shall never close to that city four square.
[time=2286] Their life's crystal river flows, and there is no night there.
[time=2291] There they need no sunshine bright in that city four square, for the lamb is all the light,
[time=2297] and there is no night there." The Bible says that the four square city is a city of great grandeur and plentyus in room.
[time=2307] Every once in a while someone will say to me, "Pastor, do you believe that heaven will be big enough for all of those who ultimately will find their place of abode?" The Bible gives us a few dimensions of the four square city.
[time=2320] It says by translating these terms from the book of Revelation into terminology that we understand
[time=2327] that this city four square is 1,750,329 square miles on its base.
[time=2336] Someone has compared that to known quantities.
[time=2339] It is ten times as big as Germany, ten times as big as France, and forty times as big as all of England,
[time=2346] and that's just on the bottom floor.
[time=2348] Remember that the Scripture says it is a city four square.
[time=2351] It is as large this way as it is this way as it is this way.
[time=2355] And according to those who understand the nature of the city, it will be a city with many levels.
[time=2360] Someone has said, "Is there enough room for all who will go there?" First of all, I think that statement is usually predicated on a misunderstanding of exactly how many are headed in that direction.
[time=2372] But I want to assure you that the Scripture has made ample provision in the Bible to give us absolute certainty
[time=2380] that God has made a place for all who will be in heaven.
[time=2384] If we just took the base, the first floor, Gary Cohen, who has written a great deal on prophecy,
[time=2390] has said that the density of the population of London according to the 1956 census,
[time=2396] if we use that and multiply it out to cover all of the ground floor of that place, the Scripture calls the Holy City.
[time=2403] It would care for 72 billion inhabitants just on the ground floor.
[time=2408] Don't worry about there being room for you.
[time=2411] Just make sure that you've made your reservation.
[time=2414] God has a place big enough in heaven for all those who He calls to Himself.
[time=2420] Now the Bible is full of wonderful descriptions of the city.
[time=2424] It automatically comes to those who have chosen not to believe in the Scripture that they will take these beautiful terms of description and in some way, spiritualize the truth away from them.
[time=2436] For instance, the Bible tells us in verse 21 that the gates which surround this beautiful city
[time=2444] are made of twelve pearls.
[time=2446] One each of the gates was of one pearl.
[time=2450] I remember when I used to hear of the pearly gates I had in my mind the idea of gates that were studded with little pearls, the most beautiful sight you could see.
[time=2458] But as I studied the Scripture I discovered that according to this passage, the gates are not studded with pearl.
[time=2464] They are an entire pearl all by themselves.
[time=2468] The huge gate is made of one magnificent pearl that is beyond anything mine can imagine.
[time=2474] I looked not too long ago in Guinness Book of Records to find out where the largest pearl in the world was located and I discovered that the largest pearl that man knows is called the pearl of Allah.
[time=2485] It is five and a half by nine and a half inches.
[time=2488] And yet the Bible says the gates of the holy city, each of them made out of one gigantic pearl.
[time=2493] You say, "Pastor, do you believe that?" Yes, I believe it.
[time=2496] Because a God who could create a world with the beauty I can envision here as I walk about this earth and has said that heaven is better than this place and can certainly create a gate as large as this room out of pearl if he chooses to do so.
[time=2510] The Bible goes on to say that it's a place where the streets are of gold.
[time=2515] Oh, you say you don't really believe that heaven has got golden streets.
[time=2519] Well, I certainly do.
[time=2521] I've heard all the spirituals that you've heard about dancing around on the golden streets in heaven.
[time=2526] The first thing I plan to do is kick off my shoes and walk down those golden streets.
[time=2531] I believe that the Scripture tells the truth when it says the streets are of gold.
[time=2535] Listen to the word.
[time=2537] It says that the gates were of pearl, each one of a one pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were, transparent glass.
[time=2547] The Bible says that the streets of heaven are of such beautiful gold that they're like glass through which you can see.
[time=2553] Transparent glass, transparent gold.
[time=2558] The Bible says that in that great city there's a tree called the Tree of Life.
[time=2562] In chapter 22 and verse 2 we read in the midst of the street of the city and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life, which bore twelve kinds of fruit and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
[time=2576] A tree that sprouted fruit each month of twelve different kinds, all from one magnificent piece of agriculture.
[time=2584] God is going to make that place so beautiful and He is building that place so wonderful.
[time=2590] That your imagination cannot possibly come to grips with the beauty of that city.
[time=2597] The Bible tells us in chapter 22 and verse 1 that is a city through which there is a stream of life,
[time=2604] the water of life, and He showed me a pure river of water.
[time=2608] The water of life clears crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
[time=2613] The psalmist wrote of this in Psalm 46-4 when he wrote, "There is a river the streams were of shall make glad the city of God, Psalm 46-4."
[time=2627] But you know the thing that excites me more than anything else about heaven is not all of the outward beauty, the streets of gold, the gates of pearl, and all of the things that the Scripture records about the external aspects of the beauty of the city.
[time=2641] Perhaps we would miss it if we did not read it carefully, but the Bible says it is a holy city.
[time=2647] It is a city in which no lie will ever be told.
[time=2653] It is a place where no evil word will ever be spoken.
[time=2658] It is a city where no shady business deals will ever be discussed, no unclean pictures or pornography will ever be existed.
[time=2666] No corruptions of life will be manifest. It will be holy because everyone in it will be absolutely holy like unto the Savior.
[time=2675] It is a holy city.
[time=2678] Every once in a while someone says to me, "Pastor, what are we going to do when we get to heaven?" I couldn't help but think about this as I saw the harp today.
[time=2688] Most people have in their minds eye when we get to heaven, we're all going to sit around and play a harp.
[time=2692] Now for Kathy that might be alright, but I have to admit that doesn't hold a great deal of excitement for me.
[time=2699] If heaven is just sitting around playing a harp.
[time=2702] And I remember one day opening the Bible and going through the pages of this book to discover what God had to say about what we're going to do when we get to heaven.
[time=2710] Would you like to know?
[time=2711] What are you going to do throughout eternity in that beautiful city where you spend your time with the Lord?
[time=2717] Let me share it with you.
[time=2719] First of all, the Scripture tells us we're going to sing.
[time=2722] Don Kruger has done so much with the music here.
[time=2726] He's tuning us all up for our eternal occupation.
[time=2729] One of these days we're going to sing like we've never sung before.
[time=2732] I get teased a lot as a pastor because I sing with all of my heart and all of my voice, sometimes just about blow the other staff members away when they're sitting next to me.
[time=2741] Often times that's to drown out other sounds that are near me, but sometimes I love to sing.
[time=2751] And you know something?
[time=2752] The Bible says according to the book of Revelation that we're going to spend eternity in singing.
[time=2758] I was interested to find out that there are more songs mentioned in the book of Revelation than in any other book of the Bible with the exception of the Psalms.
[time=2767] And in the 19th chapter we have the song that we're going to sing.
[time=2771] I wish we had time to look at it in its entirety.
[time=2774] Chapter 19 verses 1 through 8.
[time=2777] And after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven saying hallelujah, salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God.
[time=2787] And there is the lyric for the great song that we'll be singing.
[time=2791] We're going to sing together.
[time=2792] Let me share with you.
[time=2793] Secondly, we're going to serve.
[time=2794] I can only touch upon it.
[time=2796] Revelation chapter 22 verse 3 says, "And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God, and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him."
[time=2806] When we get to heaven we're going to serve God with unadulterated motivation because we love him and we want to be a part of his ministry.
[time=2814] The Bible says that we're going to share together in heaven.
[time=2817] I wish we had time to look at the marriage supper of the Lamb recorded in the 19th chapter just a prefiguring of the fellowship we're going to enjoy in heaven.
[time=2826] Can you imagine what it will be like to have fellowship with all of the greats who have walked before us in the faith and listened to this?
[time=2833] There will be no time restrictions.
[time=2835] You can sit down with the Apostle Paul for a couple of thousand years, ask him all the questions you want to ask about what he's written, and when you get done there will still be as much time left in eternity as there was when you started.
[time=2846] You can go over and talk to Peter and get him straightened out.
[time=2849] Oh, it's exciting to think about the fellowship we'll enjoy.
[time=2853] One of the things that just so hard for me is the pastor of this church.
[time=2858] As it grows and multiplies and the people come, I just wish I had time.
[time=2864] I wish I had time to fellowship with all of you individually, just to spend time with you as much time as there is.
[time=2871] And there isn't enough time.
[time=2873] But all when we get to heaven, what a joy it's going to be.
[time=2877] Fellowship, uninhibited by the clock, what a joy.
[time=2881] We're going to share it together.
[time=2883] When the Scripture goes on to tell us that when we get to heaven, we're going to study.
[time=2887] I don't have time to develop it, but just let me say that we're going to continue to grow.
[time=2891] We'll not be absolute in terms of our absolute knowledge when we get to heaven.
[time=2896] We'll be perfect without sin, but we'll continue to know more and more about God throughout eternity as we study to learn about him.
[time=2905] Oh, heaven's a wonderful place.
[time=2907] I want to share with you last some things that aren't going to be in heaven.
[time=2913] Oh, I want you to listen.
[time=2915] Listen carefully and look with me at the Scripture.
[time=2919] The Bible says there are a few things that are going to be missing from heaven.
[time=2922] I'm as excited about the things that aren't going to be in heaven as I am about the things that are going to be there.
[time=2927] Let's take just a moment to look at some of the things the Bible says are not going to be in heaven.
[time=2935] First of all, the Scripture says there's not going to be a church in heaven.
[time=2940] No sanctuary there.
[time=2942] Oh, you say pastor, are you excited about there not being any church?
[time=2945] Listen, chapter 21 verse 3 says this, "And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God.'"
[time=2963] Chapter 21 verse 22, "And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."
[time=2972] Chapter 22 verse 4, "And they shall see His face, and His name shall be in their foreheads." Why do we come to church?
[time=2979] To learn about the Lord, to study the Word, to draw closer to Him.
[time=2983] There won't be any temple in heaven because the Lord Himself will dwell among us, and He will be our temple.
[time=2989] And He will be the center of our worship.
[time=2991] We won't have to come to houses made by hands, but the Lord Himself will be among us.
[time=2996] There'll be no temple in heaven.
[time=2998] There'll be no church in heaven.
[time=3002] We look out upon the skies and the horizon, and see the brilliant ball of fire that warms and lights this globe.
[time=3009] But the Scripture says, "There'll be no sun when we get to heaven." Chapter 21 verse 23 says it this way, "And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did light it, and the Lamb is the lamp of it."
[time=3024] Chapter 22 verse 5 says, "And there shall be no light there, for they shall need no lamp, neither the light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign forever and forever."
[time=3037] There'll be no sickness in heaven.
[time=3039] Oh, I know my wife is going to be happy to hear that.
[time=3044] We have had so much sickness in our house.
[time=3047] Just as soon as we get up from one, there's another one comes down.
[time=3057] We got up this morning and found out David was sick, and I thought, "Oh, this is about ten Sundays in a row.
[time=3062] If it hadn't been for the television ministry, my poor wife would have been to church this year, I don't believe." And that's just a little, we don't know anything about hurt and pain and sickness like some of you folks have endured, but the Bible says when we get to heaven it's not going to be any of that.
[time=3078] Listen to what it says, chapter 21 verse 4, "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.
[time=3095] There will be no sadness in heaven." The same verse says there's not going to be any sorrow, no sadness.
[time=3105] There'll be no separation in heaven.
[time=3107] You say, "What do you mean by that?" There's a very interesting verse, John chapter 21 verse 4, "I've never quite understood that.
[time=3114] It says, 'God shall wipe away all their tears from their eyes, there shall be no more death."
[time=3120] Death, of course, is separation.
[time=3123] But there's another verse that illustrates that from the life of the apostle who wrote.
[time=3129] Verse 21, chapter 21 verse 1, "And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away."
[time=3139] Now notice this phrase, "And there was no more sea." I've often wondered why John wrote that.
[time=3145] And then I remembered something.
[time=3147] Where was John when he wrote this?
[time=3149] He was on the isle of Patmos.
[time=3152] And what was all around him there?
[time=3154] He was surrounded by the sea.
[time=3157] And the sea to John represented separation from all of those that he knew and loved.
[time=3162] Oh, how he must have loved to have written those words when I get to heaven, no more separation.
[time=3167] No more sea, no more walls between those that we love.
[time=3175] Well, let me share with you lastly.
[time=3178] There'll be no sin in heaven.
[time=3181] No sin.
[time=3183] Chapter 21 verse 27, "And there shall in no way enter into heaven anything that defileth, neither he that worketh abomination or makeeth a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life."
[time=3198] I used to say there'd be no sinners in heaven, but that's not true, is it?
[time=3202] All of us who go to heaven are sinners.
[time=3206] And we have been saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. We'll be sinners saved by grace in heaven, but I want to tell you something that's not going to be any sin in heaven.
[time=3215] I read the papers every day and see of all of the terrible, awful things that happen in our world.
[time=3221] It seems like every week we have passed the boundaries that were set before and we've gone into some more uninhibited wickedness.
[time=3231] Man is sinning in ways he never dreamed of before.
[time=3236] I want to tell you something, one of these days God is going to come back and take his own to heaven and there's going to be a place there where sin cannot enter in.
[time=3245] Where you will not have the defilement around you that you have with the sin of this world because the redeemed will be there.
[time=3254] As I think about heaven, I'm excited about it.
[time=3258] I remember hearing a story about a little girl who was blind.
[time=3263] One day they did an operation on her eyes and they covered her eyes for the period of recuperation and they brought her at last to the surgeon to have the bandages removed.
[time=3282] And when her bandages were off and her eyes were opened, she ran to the window and she looked up into the heavens and she exclaimed to her mother, "Oh mother, why didn't you tell me it was so beautiful?
[time=3293] All the heavens and the world, it's so beautiful. Mother, why didn't you tell me?" She said, "Honey, I've been trying. The best I know how to describe for you the beauty of this world, but words just weren't sufficient."
[time=3309] I have an idea when we get to heaven, we'll say to John, "John, why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you let us know that it was a place like this?"
[time=3317] And John will say, "You remember I wrote a book to you. The book of Revelation, I tried my best to describe it, but words just weren't sufficient."
[time=3327] All of this is to say that heaven is a place God has prepared for those who have put their trust in Him.
[time=3335] Have you done that? You say, "How do you make a reservation for heaven?" You come to the place where you recognize you can't earn your way there and you cast yourself upon the Lord and you accept His free provision of heaven, which is a free gift.
[time=3350] Right now, in your heart, you can pray the prayer. Lord Jesus, I recognize I'm a sinner. I want to spend eternity with you in heaven.
[time=3358] I want to accept Jesus Christ as my Savior and my Lord and receive Him into my life, and that's how you make your reservation in heaven.
[time=3367] That's how you do it. You can do it right now. Shall we pray together?
[time=3373] If our heads bowed and our eyes closed, let me ask you this question. Do you know for sure that if you were to die today, you would go to heaven?

[time=3536] And by the upraised hand, give absolute certainty that you know you are going to heaven.
[time=3542] I wonder if you'd let us pray with you today.
[time=3545] And what I'd like for you to do is this.

[time=3550] And when you raise your hand, I'll know that it's because you're concerned about your death.
