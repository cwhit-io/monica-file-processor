[time=19] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=31] [ Singing ]
[time=75] Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=82] On this Sunday, we are beginning officially our 9th Annual Missions Conference, and we're looking forward with great anticipation to the blessing of God upon us during these next days.
[time=94] We're so grateful that God has given to us the opportunity to share the ministry of missions,
[time=100] and we trust that during these next few moments you will catch something of the spirit of missions as God has laid it upon our hearts.
[time=109] Several months ago, I was accosted by a young man who asked me a question that has been asked of me many times.
[time=115] He said, "Do you believe that a righteous God, a holy, righteous God,
[time=121] would ever consign someone to an eternity of punishment and hell who had never heard a clear presentation of the gospel?" In other words, he said, "What about the heathen in Africa who have never heard of Jesus Christ?
[time=136] Are they responsible before God? Are they lost?" Today, as we have opportunity to open the scriptures together, we're going to do our very best from the viewpoint of God and his word to answer that question.
[time=151] But first, we want to introduce to you some people who were here with us today as our special guests.
[time=158] They are the missionaries who are serving with us during this conference.
[time=163] I'm going to ask that before our choir sings, they take just a moment to introduce themselves
[time=169] and share with us who they are and where they minister so that from the very beginning
[time=175] we'll know who the very special people are who are ministering with us during these days.
[time=182] I am David Black.
[time=184] My wife, Susan, and sons, Jonathan, and James are not able to be with me for this conference.
[time=189] We praise God for a good first term out in the Philippines with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism
[time=195] and we're looking forward yet this year of returning for our second term.
[time=200] I am Bob Nuszka from Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[time=203] My wife and I have served in Bangladesh for three years as short termers under the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism and we will be returning, very shortly we hope, to that country as full termers, my selfish business manager of Memorial Christian Hospital in the heart of the jungle in the poorest land in the world.
[time=221] I'm Jimmy Nuszka, the other half of this team, also serving in Bangladesh with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=231] I am Charles John with Baptist Midmissions working in the land of India.
[time=236] My wife, Anima, and the three children, Vinod, Promod, and Pradeep are not with me.
[time=241] They are back in India.
[time=243] I am here on a short business and will be returning next month to the field.
[time=248] I'm Carol Bibighaus, getting ready for my second term in Hong Kong serving under ABWE, Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=257] My name is Lee Wise, I'm also with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=261] We'll be going to Chile, South America.
[time=263] We'll be going into there to a church planning and evangelism ministry within that country in Santiago, there with three million people in the capital city.
[time=273] I'm Sherry Wise, the other half of the team that's going to Chile, to minister the word of God to the people there.
[time=280] I'm Mel Cummings, missionary appointee with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=285] God has called my wife and I to a church planning ministry here in the USA and we plan on going to the larger cities of America and starting gospel preaching churches.
[time=294] I'm Trisha Cummings, and that's my husband, Mel, and we're excited to have the Lord called us into missionaries and here in the United States with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=307] We don't often have opportunity to express our appreciation to those who carry the gospel, let's do it, shall we, and let them know we're with them.
[time=322] I especially like to hear Brother Cummings speak, don't you?
[time=326] I want to be here the night he gives his testimony because I like to hear him speak.
[time=331] Our choir is going to sing now and they've chosen a song with a missionary theme, "Here Am I." I hope that is the spirit in your heart as you think about this conference
[time=341] and God's call upon your life for world evangelism.
[time=352] [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=506] - Thank you, Choir.
[time=510] I hope that's the spirit of your heart.
[time=512] As we began to think about our ninth annual missionary conference, we had the opportunity and the thinking process to have the privilege of the ministry of the SMITE team, Liberty Baptist College in Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=527] Under the direction of Roscoe Brewer, these young people travel all over the world in the interest of world missions.
[time=533] They have visited many of the countries of the world to share in the evangelization of the peoples.
[time=540] Last night, we heard from them for the first time in our missionary banquet, and they were a real blessing and challenge to my own heart.
[time=548] Throughout this conference, they're going to be ministering to us the message of missions through music.
[time=553] We want to introduce to you now the SMITE team and Roscoe Brewer.
[time=557] [MUSIC] With hand-out stretched [MUSIC] To point the way to go [MUSIC] He stood erect [MUSIC] His voice was clear and firm [MUSIC] To all believers [MUSIC] Through all time he spoke [MUSIC] To show the reason why [MUSIC] He lives again [MUSIC] You too [MUSIC] Oh, oh, oh [MUSIC] Ignitions [MUSIC] My disciples [MUSIC] Teach them how to live [MUSIC] In peace and love [MUSIC] And all who live and go [MUSIC] That joys in today [MUSIC] Oh, I know with you [MUSIC] I am with you to the end [MUSIC] His voice is so clear to me now [MUSIC] When I look on his face [MUSIC] And feel his touch [MUSIC] I rejoice [MUSIC] That he wants me to go [MUSIC] Go to the world [MUSIC] Make all nations my disciples [MUSIC] Teach them how to live [MUSIC] In peace and love [MUSIC] And all who live and go [MUSIC] That dies in my bed [MUSIC] Oh, I'll go with you [MUSIC] I am with you to the end [MUSIC] Go to the world [MUSIC] Make all nations my disciples [MUSIC] Teach them how to live [MUSIC] In peace and love [MUSIC] And all who live and go [MUSIC] That dies in my bed [MUSIC] I'll go with you [MUSIC] I'll go with you [MUSIC] I am with you to the end [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1495] My team is coming to sing for us once more before the message.
[time=1498] I want to give you an update on a special project that we have all been involved in for the television ministry.
[time=1504] Some of you know that we had a goal a few weeks ago to raise $70,000 for the television ministry,
[time=1510] and we are now, as I shared this morning earlier, five-seventh of the way there.
[time=1516] Just a little bit under $50,000 has come in, and we're so grateful to all who have had a part.
[time=1522] This next two weeks will tell the story of whether or not we really meet the goal if you haven't had a part in it already.
[time=1529] You may choose to do that as we try to get out the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to the areas that God has opened up to us in the television ministry.
[time=1538] We also want you to know that there is an opportunity for you to be regularly involved in the ministry of television through the Founders Club.
[time=1546] Those of you here in the auditorium have a Founders Club card in your bulletin.
[time=1551] It makes it possible for you to be involved in the regular support of the television ministry as so many of our folks are.
[time=1558] If you would like to have a part in that, simply fill the card out and see that it gets back to the office, please do not overlook the beautiful Founders Club display in one of the display areas in the foyer.
[time=1570] As God lays the burden of world evangelization upon your heart, part of our job is to reach those all around us.
[time=1577] And we can do that ever so effectively through the ministry of television.
[time=1580] If he would have you to be a part of the regular support team, it would be a great encouragement to us.
[time=1585] Television is not new to the SMITE team.
[time=1588] Many of you watch them often on the old time gospel hour.
[time=1591] I don't suppose there are many schools that I'm aware of that have more of a burden for world evangelization than the Liberty Baptist College and their Chancellor and Leader, Dr. Jerry,
[time=1599] and Leader, Dr. Jerry Falwell.
[time=1601] We're so grateful to have them here today, and we're going to ask that they sing for us one more time before the message.
[time=1629] [MUSIC]
[time=1633] Little children begging for just a piece of bread.
[time=1647] And though they are so hungry, they gladly take a little love instead.
[time=1658] [MUSIC]
[time=1661] Look at the homes that are nears.
[time=1667] Shatter dreams and fears.
[time=1674] It's a lonely world they live in.
[time=1679] We're so glad they're waiting to hear.
[time=1685] Let them know, let them know.
[time=1692] Tell them Jesus loves them so.
[time=1699] Loves them so much and to cavalry, he will go.
[time=1712] Let them know, let them know.
[time=1725] To live forever more with Jesus.
[time=1732] Let them know, let them know.
[time=1740] [MUSIC]
[time=1758] Many lonely people are searching everywhere.
[time=1769] Looking for the answer, that will change their life of fear and despair.
[time=1784] Jesus is the answer, he's the one who really cares.
[time=1798] And if we'll only tell them, a little happiness and love can be theirs.
[time=1810] Let them know, let them know.
[time=1817] Tell them Jesus loves them so.
[time=1830] He will go, let them know, let them know.
[time=1843] Let them know, let them know, that they too can go.
[time=1849] To live forever more with Jesus.
[time=1863] Let them know, let them know.
[time=1877] [MUSIC]
[time=1907] Thank you young people, that is the purpose for which we are meeting this week, that we might be encouraged to let them know of the saving power of our wonderful Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1919] If you have your Bibles, I want you to turn with me to the first chapter of the Book of Romans.
[time=1924] And though we will not take time to read all of our texts this morning, I want to begin my reading in Romans chapter 1 with the 18th verse, and we will read through verse 20.
[time=1934] Romans chapter 1 verses 18 through 20.
[time=1941] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all in godliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=1950] Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shown it unto them.
[time=1957] For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, so that they are without excuse.
[time=1981] Shall we pray? Our Father, we pray that you will guide our thoughts and our words in these next moments.
[time=1990] It is an awesome subject with which we deal, to think of a world of men and women dying as we learned last night at the rate of 200 per second.
[time=2001] We ask our Father that you will challenge us from the Word of God anew with the awful lostness of a world that is yet to hear what most of us know so clearly, that Jesus is the one about whom the Scripture writes, when it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."
[time=2028] We pray that our hearts and minds will be open to the truth by which the Holy Spirit will challenge our lives in these moments in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=2040] Several years ago I was speaking to the Intervarsity Fellowship at the Glassboro State University while I was ministering in another part of the United States.
[time=2050] My topic had been assigned to me, very one, one that is very fresh in my mind right now. The subject they had given me to deal with was heaven and hell are they for real.
[time=2061] In the room where young people from all persuasions of life, some of them from Eastern mystical religious groups, some of them just plain intellectual agnostics, most of them had come to hear if there were still anybody still alive on the planet
[time=2077] who would be so bold as to address a subject that seemed as absurd as that one. In the back of the room, a young lady during the question time lifted her hand and asked this question.
[time=2088] She said, "Pastor, what about the heathen in Africa who have never heard of Jesus Christ? Will they be sent to hell even though they have never been told about the Savior?"
[time=2101] I guess I should have been unsurprised at that question. It pops up in most discussions concerning Christianity. Dr. Paulie Little who has written the book entitled "How to Give Away Your Faith" lists the questions that people most often ask of Christians.
[time=2118] And one of the questions on the list is this very question, "Are the heathen really lost?" Before we turn to the word of God to examine what Paul says in the book of Romans in answer to this question, I'd like to take just a moment to point out to you that this is a problem which is not simply the solving of our idle curiosity.
[time=2138] We are not simply dealing here with a theological question that needs an answer. At stake in this issue are some very important things which most of us as Christians hold very dear.
[time=2151] It is not a matter of my simply saying that there is a good answer to this very pointed question, but it is imperative that we understand that in the answer to this question and with the answer of this question, many, many cardinal truths of the word of God are at stake.
[time=2169] The first thing that is at stake in this question is the fact that if this is not the true condition of the world and that is lost and without hope, then God's word is not true.
[time=2181] Nowhere in the pages of the Bible are we ever given any reason to believe that there is a provision for heathen men apart from the cross of Jesus Christ and the Christian gospel.
[time=2193] On the contrary, the Bible is filled with dogmatic statements of the absolute uniqueness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2207] The truth and the life no man come with unto the Father but by me.
[time=2220] There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.
[time=2234] Between God and man the man Christ Jesus, like the one in John chapter 17 and verse 3, and this is life eternal that they might know the, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
[time=2249] Jesus speaking to Nicodemus one dark night when he was accosted by this leader of the Jewish religion answered in a reply to Nicodemus question except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[time=2266] Men and women if the heathen of all the world are not lost and yet they have not come to God by the way set forth in the scripture as the only way then God's word cannot be true and we must discount its teaching completely.
[time=2283] The second thing that is at stake in the lostness of the heathen and the answer to this question is the purpose of Jesus Christ himself.
[time=2294] When the Lord Jesus Christ came into this world born in a manger in Bethlehem the angel comforted the frightened shepherds on the hillsides outside of Bethlehem by sharing with them this great proclamation.
[time=2308] Fear not they said for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.
[time=2317] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord.
[time=2323] If the heathen of all the world are not lost what kind of good news would be found in Jesus Christ which would apply to all people.
[time=2333] When Christ was beginning his public ministry John the Baptist pointed to him and said behold the Lamb of God which takeeth away the sin of the world.
[time=2344] If the heathen are not lost why would there be a need for a sacrifice for the world's sin.
[time=2350] During Christ's ministry while speaking with that same Nicodemus whom we've already mentioned in the message.
[time=2356] Our Lord made this point as to the purpose of his coming into the world he said for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved.
[time=2370] Men and women if the heathen are not lost then the birth of Christ and the life of Christ and the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ is of no avail and is totally without purpose.
[time=2381] The third thing that is at stake in our answer to this question is the realization that if the heathen are not lost then what we're doing here today in our program of world missions is the most absurd and cruel thing that could ever be done.
[time=2396] Follow my reasoning if the heathen are not lost.
[time=2401] If the heathen are not lost even though they may never have heard of Jesus Christ then it seems to me that we would show them our greatest love and kindness and our greatest compassion of heart if we would leave them totally alone in their blindness.
[time=2421] For you see if the gospel is taken to them surely some of them will reject it and then in the rejection of the gospel they will be lost.
[time=2433] By our presenting the message to them we will make them responsible for it.
[time=2438] Would we not be much better off to just forget our missionary effort, allow them to go on in their blindness and then according to the doctrine of liberalism they would all be saved having never been confronted with the true presentation of Jesus Christ and his salvation.
[time=2453] The result of our missionary effort if the heathen are not lost is that not one it is not one of salvation but of condemnation.
[time=2461] When we go to them with the gospel we make them all responsible and some of them will not believe some of them will ultimately be lost because we carried the news to them.
[time=2471] If the heathen are not lost I should never give a dime to missions. If the heathen are not lost we should never have a missionary conference in our church.
[time=2479] I should devote myself with untiring effort to keeping missionaries away from those who have never heard lest they contribute to the eternal damnation of thousands of unsuspecting souls.
[time=2492] You see this is not just a theological question we're talking about. If it is true that the heathen of the world and the word heathen in the language of the Bible means those who have never been converted to Jesus Christ, those who are yet to hear of Jesus Christ, the nations, the populace or as the New Testament speaks of the ethnos, the great masses of people.
[time=2514] If the whole world does not stand before God is guilty then the Bible is not true. The purpose of Jesus Christ's life is lost and worldwide missions is the most cruel and absurd endeavor ever perpetrated by the Christian church.
[time=2531] But of course we know the answer to that. The Bible tells us that the world is lost apart from Christ. In the passage that we have read this morning from the Book of Romans there is a summary statement that causes us to quake in the wake of our responsibility because of it.
[time=2550] For we read in verse 18 that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.
[time=2567] And then it says at the end of that verse that because of his revelation to mankind they are without excuse. Let me share with you a few reasons why the world is lost. And when I say that I mean that a man who has never heard the name of Jesus in his life is lost and doomed for an eternal hell if he does not hear.
[time=2588] He is lost first of all because of the revelation of God to him. The Bible says in verse 18 that God has revealed himself to all men. You say Pastor Jeremiah, how does a native in India and Africa who has never heard of Jesus get a revelation from God?
[time=2605] Well the Bible tells us that that revelation comes in two packages and in the verse verse 19 we are told that it comes first of all in them and secondly to them. It is manifest in them first of all through that which we know today as the conscience.
[time=2622] God has always had the right of self-disclosure and the Bible teaches us that in the heart of every man is the realization of a moral standard of right and wrong and the conscience of man which tells him from within that there is a right standard and a wrong standard is a very, very powerful motivation
[time=2644] to all mankind that there is something other than the sin and defilement in which they may live. The Bible says that there is that which longs to correspond with God within the heart of man. There is that which theologians call the oughtness toward God. The vacuum within the heart of a man that cries out to be filled with the creator of the universe. And though that native may not know what it is, though he may not comprehend how it works if he will follow that oughtness within him to its logical conclusion.
[time=2673] According to the scripture, God will bring him into the path of the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. But the Bible says he has a revelation within him.
[time=2683] And then the scripture goes on to say that he has a revelation that is shown unto him. The first is the revelation of conscience. The second is the revelation of creation.
[time=2694] Here in the book of Romans, the apostle Paul appeals to an Old Testament Psalm, the 19th Psalm, a Psalm which declares that the heaven declare the glory of God and the earth showeth forth his handiwork.
[time=2709] All throughout the heavens and all throughout the earth and all throughout the world is the revelation of an Almighty God written in the in the pen of nature and in the language of creation.
[time=2722] The Bible says that God has showed it unto man. God has revealed himself unto man for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world. Notice our clearly seen being understood by the things that are made.
[time=2741] And what is understood by that? Even his eternal power and his Godhead. The Bible says that through the creative hand of God, man is able to understand the eternal Godhead, the eternal power of an Almighty God.
[time=2757] You say, "Preacher, do you believe that a man can be saved by looking at nature? I do not. I don't believe a man is ever saved apart from two things, the Holy Spirit in the Word of God. But I do know this that what God has revealed about himself in the creative act of the world is enough revelation to cause man to seek after God.
[time=2777] And the Scripture says that when he seeks after God and he obeys the light that he is given, God will give him additional light until he finally comes to know Christ through the testimony of a missionary or someone who goes to share the gospel with him.
[time=2791] The Bible says that man is guilty because of the revelation within him, his conscience, and because of the revelation to him, his creation. Joseph Addison has written a hymn, which is usually sung in the more liturgical churches in some dignified services, but it is a great hymn.
[time=2813] It is Joseph Addison's attempt to put into words the message of God through nature. The title of the hymn is the spacious firmament on high. Listen to the words of this great hymn.
[time=2826] He wrote the spacious firmament on high with all the blue ethereal sky and spangled heavens, a shining frame, their great original Proclaim.
[time=2840] The unwearied son from day to day does his creator's power display and publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand. Soon as the evening shades prevail, the moon takes up the wondrous tale.
[time=2858] And nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of its birth, while all the stars that round her burn and all the planets in their turn confirm the tidings as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole.
[time=2875] What though in silence all move round this dark terrestrial ball, what though no real voice nor sound amidst their radiant or be found. In reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice, forever singing as they shine, the hand that made us is divine.
[time=2899] The poet has said that when the sun goes down having sung the song of its creator and redeemer throughout all the day the moon comes out and picks up the song and continues to sing it and declare it through the darkness of the night.
[time=2914] The Bible says that every man in every land who looks at that which is around him if he is honest with what he sees will reason back to a creator who has put all of this together and will understand that the creature is always less than the creator.
[time=2932] What has happened, what indeed has taken place with the revelation of God, the Bible tells us in Romans chapter one that though God has been revealed, he has been rejected.
[time=2945] Listen to the scriptures, beginning in verse 21, because that when they knew God through his creation, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful, but they became vain in their imaginations
[time=2961] and their foolish heart was darkened, professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man and birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.
[time=2979] I've often looked at this passage and said that if ever there was a chance for us to in one fell swoop do away with the devilish doctrine of evolution, here it is.
[time=2989] I've called this passage as I've written in my own Bible, the devolution of man. It is the downward walk of man away from God. You say, where did man go wrong? Well, he came out of the experience in the ark with Noah, and there was a chance to start the race all over again and do it right, but you know they had scarcely been on the dry ground when sin started and the family was corrupted.
[time=3013] And from that very new beginning which God gave after his judgment, man has gradually devolved until he is capable of committing the things that you and I read about in our papers today.
[time=3025] Notice the downward struggle of man. He's not getting better and better. He's getting worse and worse.
[time=3033] The scripture says that when he knew God, he did not glorify him as God. He was indifferent. The first step downward away from an almighty creating God is the step of indifference.
[time=3045] Somebody says, what do you have to do to stay away from God? Just do nothing. Just be indifferent. When you see his creative act in the world, don't glorify him as God. Just act like it's there because it's there.
[time=3057] The Bible says that those who saw God's revelation in the creative works that he had made, they glorified him not as God.
[time=3067] Notice, secondly, they were not only indifferent. They were ungrateful. It says, neither were they thankful. The sun shines to warm their bodies. The moon comes out to light their path.
[time=3077] The rain comes to fertilize the ground so that they might eat of the fruit of it, and man goes on taking for granted that which God has provided.
[time=3085] And the scripture says he is not happy. He is not grateful. He does not give thanks. He is indifferent. First of all, secondly, his ingratitude moves in to take over.
[time=3095] Thirdly, the scripture says he becomes an intellectual, and that is always one of the steps away from God.
[time=3101] There's nothing wrong with being intellectually encouraged. But to become an intellectual in the true sense of the word is to take yourself out of God's plan for your life.
[time=3111] The scripture says they became vain in their imaginations. That is, they began to conjure up things to replace God in their minds.
[time=3120] They became committed to education as a part of their worship. Rome, in her glory, during the days when she ruled the world, ruled the world through philosophy.
[time=3137] Men today have turned back to the worship of the intellect. They substitute education for salvation.
[time=3145] We have all the government programs that tell us if we can just provide a better environment. Everybody will be all right, but it doesn't work.
[time=3153] You educate a person who doesn't know God, and when he's done, he's just an educated unbeliever. That's the only difference.
[time=3160] The Bible says that these who knew God glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations.
[time=3166] They're reasoning away from God instead of toward him. The next step in the devolution of man is that they become ignorant.
[time=3173] Verse 22 says professing themselves to be wise, they become fools. Saying all the time we are filled with wisdom, they have ignored the source of wisdom which God has revealed to them through his creative work, and they become in the truest sense of the word ignorant.
[time=3189] May I say to you today that no matter how many degrees you have after your name, no matter how many years you spend in school and graduate school, and it seems like these days some people make a career out of being a student.
[time=3200] No matter how much education you have, if you do not know Jesus Christ according to the Bible, you're a fool.
[time=3206] You're a fool because you have rejected the only true source of wisdom and knowledge that God has ever given to us, and that is the person of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=3217] They became ignorant.
[time=3219] But notice lastly in the downward trend of man away from God, their indifference gave birth to ingratitude. Their ingratitude gave birth to intellectualism. Their intellectualism gave birth to ignorance, and their ignorance gave birth to idolatry.
[time=3235] Verse 23 says, "Having seen the revelation of God, and having reasoned downward away from that, now they changed the glory of the incorruptible God." And what does it say?
[time=3248] Into a image made like corruptible man to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things. When you go into the pagan countries of the world and you see them falling down before the beasts and the idols that they have created from God's creative process, you can see their revelation of man's bent toward evil.
[time=3272] Instead of recognizing the one who has made these things, they take the things that are made and make a God out of them. You say, Pastor, that's a terrible thing. That happens over there. Yes, but it happens here, doesn't it?
[time=3287] We, in our country, have taken the same path. The culmination of the present dispensation according to the Word of God will be the worship of the Antichrist. Why will we worship him? We will worship him because he will be the epitome of everything that we want, that we cry out after.
[time=3304] In our society today, we have taken the good things that God has given us, and instead of worshiping the God who gave them to us, we have made a God out of the created thing. God has given to mankind one of the most beautiful and wonderful privileges known to humanity in the opportunity for a man to love a woman. Sex is a gift from God, but what have we done with it? We have perverted it. We have begun to worship it, and we look out on the television today, and we see that having been lifted up to us.
[time=3333] Lifted up to us as the God before which we bow, we're just like the pagans in Africa. We have taken the created thing, and we worship that instead of the Creator. God has given to us the opportunity to enjoy athletic endeavor. No one enjoys that more than I do, but I believe in our country we have begun to make a God out of it.
[time=3352] We have taken that which God has given to us, and instead of thanking God for the privilege of involvement, we have made a God out of that which he has created. On and on, we could go. We have followed in our country the same path of devolution as a heathen man.
[time=3366] The Bible says that because man having heard from God, having listened to God's message in nature and in his own conscience, and instead of reasoning upward back to God, he has reasoned from his revelation downward to the defilement and corruption of his own life, God says that man is without excuse, and that he will stand before God in the day of judgment, and he will be declared.
