[time=0] Get a feed out, for we need your strength from day to day.
[time=16] There's no other we can't turn to.
[time=27] Who can help us face another day?
[time=38] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us.
[time=49] For we need you to help us.
[time=56] Find our way.
[time=61] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us.
[time=72] For we need you to help us find our way.
[time=83] Gentle shepherd, come and feed us.
[time=94] For we need your strength from day to day.
[time=106] There's no other we can't turn to.
[time=117] Who can help us face another day?
[time=128] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us.
[time=139] For we need you to help us.
[time=146] Find our way.
[time=151] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us.
[time=172] We're so grateful that you've joined us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=177] I want to take this opportunity to express to all of you who are part of this ministry in supporting it with your prayers and finances my special thanks for your help during these past few days.
[time=188] Donna, it's been just an exciting thing to see the way people have responded to us in this particular time of need that we've had.
[time=197] Yes, it really has, and we might share with the people that we still need to hear from a number more of them if we're going to reach our ultimate goal.
[time=204] I had the opportunity this week to just sort of selectively call some of the folks who had helped us not only hear in this area but in other parts where the television program is seen and was really enjoyed to talk with some of them personally and to sense their enthusiasm for the Bible Hour.
[time=221] I wish I had time to reflect some of the comments that they've shared with me as to the unique nature of our television program.
[time=229] Most of them have expressed the fact that they're excited about the fact that we don't take the majority of our service to use for promotion and publicity and all of that, but we stay to the preaching of the Word of God and music and ministering to the hearts of people.
[time=245] It's really exciting to get the feedback from the people. If there's any problem that we have in this type of ministry, is that it's a one-way proposition that we don't get any feedback from them and it's really important to us to hear from them.
[time=258] Don't you wish sometimes you could just pack up for about a month and go around and visit everybody that you've ever heard from and just get to know them personally and talk with them and find out what their life is like?
[time=269] Being the vagabond at heart that I am, I'd love that.
[time=272] Well, I don't think that the board here would be too happy about us taking a month off to do that, but we can visit with you every day, every Sunday, and your home as we come in through the most intimate media, the most intimate means of communication known to man, which is
[time=287] the television ministry that God has given us, and we're so grateful for so many of you who've had a part in making sure that that program continues to come into your home each week.
[time=297] Don has mentioned that we still need to hear from a number of you who have yet to write, and I'd like to reinforce that because we have gone over the $50,000 mark in the current project and our goal was 70 in order to make up the deficit that was created during the last year.
[time=314] I can't emphasize enough to all of you how vital it is that we do meet that goal because if we are unable to meet it, that means that we will continue to have to carry that deficit as we meet the current needs of the television ministry in the days ahead.
[time=329] So, be praying with us about it, and if you haven't done what you can do to help the Bible hour, please get in touch with us this week.
[time=335] It's been a long time since we offered something to our people at home, and we want to take just a moment to sort of reopen one of the most popular gift offers that we've ever made available to our Bible, our family.
[time=348] It's a booklet entitled "The Four Gospels" arranged as a single narrative, and it's really a helpful tool as you study through the New Testament.
[time=357] You don't have to switch back and forth from one passage to the other to find the corresponding narratives.
[time=363] I was thinking about that especially this week as I thought about the series of messages that I'm beginning this morning on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=373] And I don't believe there's any one event in the life of Christ that's made clearer than the crucifixion of Christ, which is given to us in this narrative of the Gospels.
[time=386] One of the problems in trying to trace through all of the events of Christ's trial, his arrest, his crucifixion, his resurrection is that each of the Gospels gives a little additional light.
[time=397] But in this book, they're all put in chronological order, so you can actually start at the beginning of the trial of Christ and read through the events of his trial, his crucifixion, discouraging all of the things that happened to him, as well as his resurrection.
[time=412] And as you read, it's just like reading the story of his life, but it is simply the words of the Scripture placed in chronological order.
[time=419] It's an exciting way to read the Gospels, especially during this time of the year when our hearts are sensitive to his death and his resurrection at the Easter season.
[time=428] So if you'd like to have a copy of the four Gospels arranged as a single narrative, all you have to do is write to us.
[time=434] There is absolutely no obligation. If you'll write to me this week, we'll be happy to send you your free copy in the return mail.
[time=441] Now, when you write right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=449] Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=457] And we hope we'll hear from you this week. Donna, we're getting ready to take just a couple of days of vacation.
[time=463] I'm looking forward to that with the children, aren't you?
[time=465] Yes, the children are sky high this morning. They can't wait to leave.
[time=470] Well, we're just excited about that family time together, and we appreciate so many of you who have been praying for us as a family, for this ministry, for our church as it reaches out.
[time=480] We thank you, and we continue to covet your prayers in behalf of this ministry as we reach out to the people around us.
[time=487] Now, please stay with us. In just a few moments, I'm going to be talking about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.
[time=494] And we'll be looking at the Gospel of John. So get your Bibles, your notebook, and your pencil ready.
[time=499] We'll be looking at the Scripture in just a few moments.
[time=524] [MUSIC]
[time=554] Thank you, Dennis, for your good ministry at the organ. Last night our Black Hawk Singers ministered over in Van Wertle, Ohio at the Evangelical Church there.
[time=563] I've heard great reports of their ministry already this morning.
[time=567] We're so grateful for the dedicated singers who are part of our ministry team here, and we're thankful to God for their gifts and for their sacrificial use of time to prepare for the ministry that we so much enjoy every Sunday.
[time=580] One of the members of the Black Hawk Singers, Marilyn Wong, is going to sing for us now, and she's chosen a song entitled "I Found a Friend."
[time=589] [MUSIC]
[time=609] I found a friend when I see not worth living.
[time=618] I found a friend so tender and forgiving.
[time=628] I can't conceive how such a thing could be.
[time=638] That Jesus cared for even me.
[time=649] Each day this year, my faith in him is glory.
[time=660] He's ever near. His love is overflowing.
[time=670] I have no fear. My worldly cares are free.
[time=680] I found a friend and life began anew.
[time=691] I'm sure you find that he is your friend too.
[time=702] Because he can't, my soul will be heavy.
[time=712] I'll praise his name.
[time=717] I'll tell my Savior's story.
[time=723] What friends say to you would give his all for you.
[time=733] I found a friend and life began anew.
[time=745] I'm sure you find that he is your friend too.
[time=765] Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=774] You know, we have some wonderful guests who come to minister to us from time to time, and we always appreciate their ministry, but I just want to go on record as saying that I love to hear our people sing.
[time=785] And we have been blessed richly by some people who really know how to interpret music so that it's a message to our hearts, and we're thankful to God for that.
[time=795] Just before the message, we're going to hear from Carol and Jenny again, and they share with us this number in special music.
[time=810] Heavenly Father, I appreciate you.
[time=825] I love you to you. I bow down before you.
[time=834] Heavenly Father, I appreciate you.
[time=842] Son of God, I magnify you.
[time=857] I love you, I adore you. I bow down before you. Son of God, I magnify you.
[time=874] Holy Spirit, You're God to me. Holy Spirit, You're a comfort to me. I love you, I adore you. I bow down before you. Holy Spirit, You're a comfort to me.
[time=903] Try and God, I appreciate you. Try and God, I magnify you. I love you, I adore you. I bow down before you.
[time=930] Try and God, I appreciate you. Try and God, I magnify you.
[time=953] Thank you, Jenny, and Carol, for your ministry.
[time=963] It's seen in the evening in some places where television makes it possible for us to minister.
[time=967] For all of you here in this service, Carol and Jenny are going to be sharing with us tonight in the closing service of Carol's ministry here.
[time=976] And I know you'll want to be here to share in their ministry this evening as they minister in music and in testimony.
[time=983] Now with your Bibles in hand, will you join me in John's Gospel, the Gospel of John in the 19th chapter.
[time=991] And I want to read John chapter 19 verses 16 through 18. John chapter 19 verses 16 through 18.
[time=1008] Then delivered He Him, therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him away.
[time=1017] And He bearing His cross went forth unto a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified Him and two others with Him on either side one and Jesus in the center.
[time=1036] Shall we pray together?
[time=1039] Our Lord, we come into Thy presence today and we understand so very little of that about which we are to read and we are to search and understand.
[time=1052] We can read the narrative and we can understand the account of the death of Christ, but we're our service a thousand years in duration.
[time=1062] We could never come to any real meaningful comprehension of all that was involved, the day God died.
[time=1071] We don't understand and yet we bow before the cross of the Savior to worship and we come before His presence with adoration because it is through His death that we have life.
[time=1083] And through His suffering that we look forward to a day when suffering shall be a word not found in our vocabulary.
[time=1092] O Father today we pray that as we look back at the cross that you will draw us near unto it.
[time=1099] And that our Father we will be cause to worship and cause to love and adore Him who cared enough for us that He would give up Himself in death that we might have life eternal.
[time=1114] For we pray in the blessed matchless name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus, amen.
[time=1121] The Scripture says they crucified Him and in Luke's Gospel we read the cry of the embittered Jews as they screamed, "Crucify Him, crucify Him."
[time=1136] And the Scripture records that they took Him to Golgotha's mountain, there between two thieves they nailed Him to a rough-hewn tree, a cross tree that is used in the Roman ordeal of crucifixion.
[time=1152] Several months ago some of us from this church stood outside the place called Gordon's Calvary and looked up to the ugly hole in the mountain which is called the place of the skull.
[time=1164] And once again the flood tide of emotion filled our hearts as we thought this could be the place where the Redeemer of the universe hung and died that we might have life.
[time=1176] Why did they do that?
[time=1178] Could God not have come up with some other plan that would redeem lost men and women without having to send His Son into this world to die such an awful death?
[time=1190] Could the Creator of the universe who spoke and the world came into being, who said let there be light and there was light, who breathed into man the breath of life and he became a living soul?
[time=1202] Could not such a Creator come up with some alternative so that His Son, the blessed Savior, might be relieved of such an awful death?
[time=1214] No, the Scripture tells us that He had to die.
[time=1219] In the book of Matthew for instance, in the sixteenth chapter verse 21 we read these words, "From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and scribes and must be killed and raised again the third day."
[time=1241] The third day He must die.
[time=1244] In the book of Mark it says, "And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again."
[time=1258] And Luke comments in his gospel, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day," Luke 9, 22.
[time=1271] And John concludes, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."
[time=1281] The Bible says, "He had to die. There was no other way. There was no other method that God could have used to redeem lost mankind apart from the slaying of His own Son, Jesus Christ."
[time=1295] How can we comprehend that?
[time=1297] How can we begin to understand that God the Son actually came to this earth clothed in humanity and went one day to suffer the anguish of Roman crucifixion to die for all mankind?
[time=1311] Think with me for just a moment about His death.
[time=1315] The Scripture records of His death that it was according to prophecy. If a witness of the crucifixion had stood at the base of the cross during those awful hours to record the anguish that was on the face of the Lord Jesus and to write down the details of His suffering, no eyewitness could have painted a more graphic picture than did Isaiah some 800 years before the event.
[time=1341] As he writes in the 52nd and 53rd chapter of his prophecy, listen to these words, verse 14 of chapter 52, "And many were astounded at thee. His visage or his face was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men."
[time=1359] Notice again verse 5 of chapter 53, listen to Isaiah the prophet, "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, and the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed."
[time=1376] Over and over again in this Isaiah prophecy is a record of the awful, scourging and beating and suffering of the Lord Jesus, and it was recorded of Him 800 years before He walked upon this earth.
[time=1390] Isaiah said, "He would die such a death, and when He came to the cross it was such a death that He died, He died according to prophecy."
[time=1399] Every time in the Old Testament you read of the Jewish people taking a lamb or a goat to the sacrificial table and there severing the vein of that animal so that the blood gushed forth and offering that animal in bloody sacrifice to God, you have a prophetic picture of the fact that someday,
[time=1419] Jesus, the ultimate sacrificial lamb would come to the cross and die.
[time=1425] He had to die in order to fulfill the prophecy that was recorded of Him.
[time=1430] He died according to prophecy.
[time=1433] The Scripture tells us that He died of a broken heart.
[time=1437] There's an interesting bit of information recorded in the Gospel of John concerning the death of Christ, and as we move through the series of messages on His death, we will no doubt have time to discuss it in more detail.
[time=1450] But we read in the 19th chapter of John in the 32nd verse that the soldiers came to Jesus after He had been crucified, and they broke the legs of the first criminal and the other who was crucified with Him.
[time=1463] But when they came to Jesus they saw that He was dead already, and they broke not His legs.
[time=1470] How is it that His legs were not broken?
[time=1474] There is no way to understand that, and the verse that follows concerning the piercing of His side with a sword except to understand that when they came to Jesus they did not break His legs, for they learned by examination that He was dead already.
[time=1489] The historians who record the events of Roman crucifixion tell us that it is quite possible for someone who has been crucified according to the Roman custom to hang upon a cross in anguish for some three days.
[time=1502] It was a mission of mercy that the soldiers came to break the legs of the criminals so that they would die before the awful drags of their suffering would be drained to the very last drop.
[time=1514] But when they came to Jesus that day He was dead, and the Scripture says the soldier took a spear and thrust it into his side and their burst forth from that gaping wound, blood and water.
[time=1527] Recently, while I was studying this passage of Scripture, I looked into the Bible Encyclopedia that I have in my office.
[time=1537] And in that particular encyclopedia was the record of one Dr. Stroud, a London physician who said that the mixture of blood and water that poured forth from that side wound of Jesus was an evidence of a ruptured heart and that the blood in the water had been released into that cavity.
[time=1555] And when the sword was thrust into his side, that blood and water gushed forth, evidencing that his death had occurred not from crucifixion, but because his heart was broken.
[time=1567] What broke his heart? What caused that to happen? The Scripture says he came into this world with the desire to reach his own with the gospel he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[time=1578] The 11 whom he had drawn close to him for the purpose of ministry according to the Scripture in the night of his greatest agony slept outside the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=1588] One of his own Judas by name betrayed him, paying the awful price of his own life coming to betray Jesus with a kiss and selling him to those who would crucify him.
[time=1602] The Scripture says at the end of his trial and arrest that they all forsook him and fled. If those were the only things about which we have knowledge concerning the crucifixion of Christ and his broken heart, that would be enough to break the hearts of most people.
[time=1619] Here he had left the glories of heaven to come and minister to his own people and they would have none of it. His own disciples whom he had cultivated and taught and ministered to had turned away from him in the hour of his need.
[time=1631] They couldn't even wait up one night to pray with him during the moment of his agony they fell asleep while he was agonizing for the sin of the world.
[time=1638] Judas, one of the number had been used by Satan to betray him and the Scripture says those awful scoring words of the disciples that they all forsook him and fled.
[time=1648] And in that moment when he hung there for us, not even his disciples would stand with him with the exception of John.
[time=1657] But that's not what broke his heart. Those are all the human things that you and I can understand.
[time=1663] No, the Scripture says that he hung there upon that cross bearing the anguish and sin of all humanity.
[time=1670] He who knew no sin became sin for us, that through his righteousness we may be made like unto him.
[time=1676] He represented in his death, dying upon that Roman cross that day, all of the agony and sin and suffering and all of the rebellion against God that's ever been known by any man who ever lived.
[time=1690] He took it all upon himself there and because he was the infinite God-man he could endure in a moment of time the hell which we deserved for our sin and the weight of that.
[time=1704] And the price of that was that his heart was broken.
[time=1709] Someone has said that his body was wounded in the house of his friends.
[time=1714] But when he thought of his sheep, scattered as without a shepherd, his heart was broken.
[time=1721] He died of a broken heart.
[time=1724] I'd like to suggest to you thoroughly that he died alone.
[time=1729] He died alone.
[time=1733] As he hung there upon the cross, he looked about at those who had pierced him and those who had nailed his hands and feet to the wood.
[time=1741] And he said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
[time=1751] One of the criminals looked to him for salvation.
[time=1756] And even in his dying moment he said, "Today thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[time=1762] Hanging there with the agony upon his soul he looked below him and there to see his mother.
[time=1768] And he said, "Mother, behold woman, behold thy son, son thy mother." What is all of that?
[time=1775] Here he is dying for all mankind.
[time=1778] And in the closing moments of his life does he think of himself.
[time=1782] No, he looks first at those who had pierced him and asked for their forgiveness.
[time=1787] He looks next at that criminal hanging beside him and offers him pardon and forgiveness.
[time=1792] He looks down at his mother and in one of the tenderest words that came from his lips he thought of her and who would care for her after he was gone.
[time=1802] And then finally having spoken to all around to whom he must communicate.
[time=1808] His last utterance was, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=1816] Sometimes when we talk about the crucifixion we get caught up in the gory details of the nails and the gaping hole and all of the suffering, the physical suffering.
[time=1829] But men and women you cannot come to grips with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ until you can enter into that prayer from his lips when he cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=1841] Ask me to explain somehow the separation of the Trinity and I can't.
[time=1846] I don't know how God the Son could be separated from God the Father, but the Scripture says that in order for him to bear my hell, which I deserve for my sin, he had to know the awful pain of being separated from his Father.
[time=1860] For you see that's what hell is. It's not only all of the things we described so recently in a message, but hell more than anything else is ultimate and final and forever separation from God in all that he is.
[time=1872] And the Bible says that Jesus suffered that for me and in that final moment he died alone.
[time=1878] God the Father looking down upon him bearing the sin of the world could not view the sin that was on his back and he turned his back upon his son.
[time=1887] And there never has been a moment that more signified the term alone than that moment when Jesus died alone.
[time=1896] He died according to prophecy. He died alone.
[time=1903] During that moment of his crucifixion, according to the Scripture, the Son refused to shine.
[time=1911] The Bible tells us that the earth did quake and the rocks were rent Matthew chapter 27.
[time=1918] The Bible records that the dead rose from the grave, that the veil of the temple was rent in two, opening the way for all men to come to God.
[time=1930] Jesus' death was a death all alone. Who was this man who died? Who was he?
[time=1941] When we go to share the gospel with our friends, one of the questions we ask is, "Who is Jesus Christ to you?"
[time=1949] I don't believe that in the early days of my ministry I comprehended how centrally important the deity of Jesus Christ was to the gospel story.
[time=1959] Think of it for just a moment. If that were just a man hanging there on the cross, if that were not Christ, the Son of God, what could his death avail?
[time=1968] But this was Jesus Christ, the Son of God. This was deity.
[time=1974] Isaiah, 800 years before this event, called him Immanuel, God with us.
[time=1983] When the angel appeared to Mary, he said, "He shall be called the Son of the highest."
[time=1990] In Luke chapter 1 verse 35 we read, "That the holy thing that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
[time=1998] These words to Mary. In Luke chapter 2 verse 49, when Jesus was in the temple and his parents came to get him, he said,
[time=2007] "You must understand that I must be about my father's business, claiming to own his heavenly father as the one to whom he reported."
[time=2017] In Matthew chapter 12 and verse 50 we read, "Whosoever shall do the will of my father in heaven, the same as my brother and my sister and my father."
[time=2026] These words of Jesus. When Jesus was baptized, as he was being baptized, the Scripture says that the voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
[time=2040] John chapter 1 verse 1 we read, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[time=2048] Who was this who died? An example? A great leader? Someone who came to provide the rebellion against the Roman authority?
[time=2061] No, this one who hung upon the cross all alone, forsaken of those who had come to save, was none other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=2071] God in the flesh, God of God.
[time=2081] You say, but that's what the Scripture records of him. How can we know that to be truth? Did you know that even his enemies called him that?
[time=2089] Over and over again in the New Testament we have that record. On an occasion when he cast unclean spirits out of a man,
[time=2095] the spirit spoke to him in Mark chapter 1 verse 24. We read their words, "Let us alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth, I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God."
[time=2108] In Luke chapter 4 and verse 41 we read that the devils came out of this man, they came out of many crying and saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of God."
[time=2118] The soldiers who crucified him on that awful dark day after the crucifixion was over and their minds had time to assimilate all that had happened said truly, truly, this is the Son of God.
[time=2132] Who was it who died for you? Who was it who died that day? It was Jesus Christ, God's Son. It was God himself in the flesh.
[time=2147] We cannot fathom that unless we understand that the one who died there that day is the one who spoke the world into creation.
[time=2156] I don't understand that. I remember reading this piece of verse that somehow comes to grips with it and at least struggles to understand it.
[time=2166] It goes something like this, his holy fingers formed the bow where grew the thorns that crowned his brow. The nails that pierced his hands were mined in secret places he designed.
[time=2181] He made the forest where there sprung the tree on which his body hung. He died upon a cross of wood, yet he made the hill on which it stood.
[time=2192] The sun which hid from him its face by his decree was put in space. The sky which darkened door his head by him above the earth was spread.
[time=2203] The spear that spilt his precious blood was tempered in the fires of God. The grave in which his form was laid was hewn in rocks his hands had made.
[time=2217] Did he have to do it? Could the one who had made all of the elements which were used to cause his death not cry out and rebelling against it and cause it not to happen?
[time=2228] Oh yes, that's what they asked him to do. "Come down from the cross," they said. "If you be the Christ, know how grateful we must be that he did not for had he come down from the cross, there could have been no salvation."
[time=2241] He went to the cross to die because he loved us and he wanted to pay the price of our sin.
[time=2252] Who crucified him? Who did that to him? Who put him on the cross?
[time=2262] Oh you say the Romans did it. History says that's true. Back in your Bibles in the 27th chapter of the book of Matthew we read beginning at verse 28 concerning the Romans part and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.
[time=2279] And when they had planted a crowd of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and they mocked him saying, "Hail king of the Jews," and they spat upon him and they took the reed and they smote him on the head.
[time=2294] And after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put on his own ramen on him and they led him away to crucify him, verse 35, and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets.
[time=2308] They parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots? Who crucified him? The Romans did it.
[time=2317] They put him on the cross. They're the ones responsible. It was a dark day for Rome. Rome is guilty. They nailed him to the cross.
[time=2328] Oh, but the Scripture says the Jews did it. From the very beginning of the story of his crucifixion, here in the 19th chapter we read that it was the Jews who wanted him dead.
[time=2341] The Jews, chapter 19 of John, verses 14 and 15. And it was the preparation of the Passover and about the sixth hour he saith unto the Jews, behold your king.
[time=2353] Pilate speaking, and they cried out, away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, we have no king but Caesar.
[time=2367] When Peter was preaching to the Jews, a message recorded in the second chapter of the book of Acts, he pointed his finger at the Jewish audience to whom he spoke and he said, "Him, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified him and slain him."
[time=2382] The Jews crucified him. They did it. It was the Jewish determination. The Jews who said his blood be upon us and upon our children.
[time=2394] It was the Jews who put him on the cross. Let's blame them. They're the ones responsible. The wicked Jews who crucified the Savior.
[time=2405] Oh, is that right? Is that what the Scripture says? God did it. God put him there. God caused him to be nailed to the cross. Isaiah 53, verse 4 says, we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God.
[time=2425] And afflicted. Isaiah 53, 10 says, it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief. Acts chapter 2, verse 23 says, he was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[time=2441] God put him there. In the eternity passed long before there was even a knowledge of Roman crucifixion. God determined in his foreknowledge to send Jesus Christ to the cross.
[time=2453] And he sent him there. God did it. The Scripture says by determinate foreknowledge. God put him on the cross. God the Father did it. He crucified him.
[time=2472] Christ did it himself. He did it. Christ went by himself to the cross. He set his face like a flint toward Jerusalem and toward death. Isaiah 53, 11 says, he shall see the travail of his own soul and shall be satisfied. Jesus Christ did it.
[time=2491] We read in the Gospels that he steadfastly set his face like a flint toward the cross. John 12, 27 says, but for this cause came I to this hour. There never was any doubt in the mind of Jesus that he was destined for the cross and for crucifixion. And with knowledge in his heart,
[time=2511] he went to the cross willingly to die. The poet has written no martyr he who bore my guilt. He died of his free will, not conquered he whose blood was spilt, his own great plan he filled. Jesus did it.
[time=2532] He went to the cross by his own volition. The Romans did it. They nailed him to the cross. The Jews did it. They said crucify him. God did it. He put him on the cross by his own determinate foreknowledge. Jesus did it. I'm going to the cross to die.
[time=2554] How convenient. Who did it? I did it. You did it. I put him there. Oh, the Romans were a part of the scheme. The Jews cooperated. God saw the need of it. Jesus Christ was willing to do it.
[time=2577] But I put him there with the sin of my soul. I sent him to the cross with my rebellion against him and my retaliation against his plan for my life and my determination to prove my own worth to God and do it my own way by my own good works. I nailed him to the cross.
[time=2597] Oh, do you see Scripture to back that up? Every place you turn. Hebrews 928 says that Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. 1 Peter 2, 24 says, "Who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness." Romans 5, 6 says, "But God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners."
[time=2626] Christ died for us. The Romans did it. The Jews did it. God did it. Christ did it. No, I did it. I put him there. Men and women until you see that you're responsible for his death and that you put him there, you will never come to appreciate what he did for you.
[time=2655] If there was any other way for you to be redeemed, no, he alone could suffer for your sin. You put him there. I put him there. How incomprehensible it is to me that have him put him there, that we refuse the free gift and benefit from his death, which he offers to us if we will but receive it.
[time=2682] The story is told in the writings of a man by the name of Bader-Wolf about Casanaka, Robert Chieftain in Greenland, who had committed many crimes.
[time=2695] One day he came to the missionary compound which was located in his area and he saw a missionary on the floor of his tent pouring over some documents.
[time=2705] In his own broken language he asked him what he was doing. The missionary told him that he was making letters and that with these letters he would make words and that with these words he could make a book speak.
[time=2718] The missionary tried to explain to him the details of writing and communication and Casanaka said, "Can the book speak to me?" And the missionary said, "Yes, it can. Let me let it speak to you." And so he began to open the pages of this book that he had translated and he read the words to this native.
[time=2739] And he told him the story of Christ's sufferings and death on the cross. And immediately the robber said, "What did this man do that he should suffer so? What crime did he commit? Has he murdered anybody? Has he taken someone's life?"
[time=2755] The missionary told him that he had done none of these nor had he done anything wrong at all but that he had gone there to die to suffer so that men like Casanaka could have life eternal though they deserve death.
[time=2774] And that native who heard the first time the story of the gospel received the remedy for his sin. My sins laid open to the rod, the back from which all guilt was free, and the eternal Son of God received the stripes once due to me.
[time=2796] I pierced those sacred hands and feet that never touched or walked in sin. I broke the heart that only beat the souls of sinful men to win. The sponge of vinegar and gall by me was placed upon his tongue. And when derision mocked his call, I stood the mocking crowd among.
[time=2818] No beam was in his eye or moat, nor laid to him was any blame, and yet his cheeks for me were smote, the cheeks that never blushed for shame. And yet his blood was shed for me to be of sin the double cure. And bomb their flows from Calvary's tree that heals my guilt and makes me pure.
[time=2840] I did it. Father, it's so easy for us to study the history, to look at the narrative and forget that it is our sin that puts your Son on the cross.
[time=2858] We did it, Lord. We've been rebellious as people. We are like the sheep that you speak of through Isaiah the prophet. We have all gone astray. Every one of us has gone our own way.
[time=2873] And yet you laid on him the iniquity of us all. Help us to see the cross in that light. Help us to understand that more than anything else in all the world, it is the supreme evidence of the love of God for a lost humanity, that he would send his Son to the cross to die for the sins of mankind.
[time=2895] If there are those, Lord, who have never accepted the result of your crucifixion, your death, in the gift of life that comes from your hand, may this be the day when they do that.
[time=2909] At home, here in this auditorium, wherever they hear the word, may they respond.
