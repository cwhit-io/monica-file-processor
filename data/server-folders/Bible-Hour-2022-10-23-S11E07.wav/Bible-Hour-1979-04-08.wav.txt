[time=0] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=10] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=15] [MUSIC]
[time=39] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=45] We are entering upon Holy Week here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=51] at period of time during the year when we remember especially our Lord's passion, His death, burial, and resurrection.
[time=59] This is Palm Sunday, and in a few moments we'll be opening the Word of God to look at one of the gospel accounts of the triumphal entry of our Lord Jesus Christ into Jerusalem, the last time of His entering into the city from which He would be taken to be killed.
[time=76] I trust you have your Bibles and that your heart is open to God's truth and that God will minister to you through the music and the spoken word in our service today.
[time=86] Before we begin our music program and the part of the service when we worship the Lord musically, I want to take just this moment to ask all of you here and all of you who listen to my voice in other places to join with us in special prayer for a family who was known to many of us in this church.
[time=104] Just recently, Ron White, who was a friend of many of our people and has been very ill over the last year, was taken back into the Parkview Hospital and we learned this morning after visiting with him briefly last night that he is in intensive care.
[time=118] And I know that Maryland and the family and their friends would appreciate a concerted effort upon all of the people of this church and all of our friends who are part of the television family, though we may not know him personally to uphold them before the throne of God.
[time=133] We also want to be in prayer for our own Laura Fager, who was back in the hospital after some recent surgery.
[time=138] I know that they would appreciate very much our praying for them.
[time=142] We're so grateful that we can sing and that we can praise God in music.
[time=147] I trust that you will listen to every word as the choir reminds us today in their musical presentation of what a great Savior we all serve.
[time=158] [MUSIC] When the sun glows once a day [MUSIC] Our hearts and our blood will bring [MUSIC] You and sinners to repay [MUSIC] Our loyal what a Savior [MUSIC]

[time=695] - We're so grateful to all of you who join us each Sunday
[time=705] for the Bible Hour Telecast.
[time=707] We're thankful for the opportunity God has given us to have a part in reaching out to your homes with the truth of God's word.
[time=714] We're especially excited during these days which are known all over the world as the Holy season.
[time=720] For those of you who are watching this outside of Fort Wayne, of course, it's a little bit later than that where you see the telecast.
[time=726] But here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, we're beginning the Easter week and we're excited about the truth we have to share.
[time=733] With me during this time away from our morning service is my wife, Donna.
[time=738] Donna, we have been getting some very tremendous letters as of late.
[time=741] We don't often take the time that I wish we could to share some of those letters with our friends at home, but we got a very special one this week and I know that it was a blessing to your heart.
[time=750] Why don't you share a part of that letter with them?
[time=752] - This person writes, "Dear Pastor Jeremiah, I would like to let you know how the Bible Hour so beautifully met a great need for me recently.
[time=763] On Sunday, March 11th, you preached a message on the subject of heaven.
[time=768] You made a comment early in the service that perhaps some who were listening had at some time invested a loved one in heaven.
[time=775] On January 31st, my father was in an accident in which he was struck by a train.
[time=781] He remained in a coma with the exception of about two hours until March 6th when he died.
[time=787] Dad's funeral was two days before your message on heaven.
[time=792] That Sunday morning, we chose to stay home and rest rather than go to church, but we watched the Bible Hour.
[time=800] Nothing you said that morning was foreign to us, but never in our lives did we so badly need to be reminded of what heaven holds for believers.
[time=810] How very thankful we are that God laid it on your heart to share what God's word has to say about heaven at the very time we needed it so badly.
[time=820] God truly is perfect in all that he does and his timing is equally perfect.
[time=828] - Now that I'm sure that we never know when we preach and when we share the music of the Bible Hour, how it is affecting the lives of people at home, but it is an exciting thing to know that God can bring a message from a pastor in Fort Wayne to the heart of some people in another city when they very badly need to hear what God has to say about a place he's prepared for those who love him.
[time=849] One of the things that we are excited about is the extension of the ministry of the word of God, not only through the preaching of the word, but through the offering of special books on the Bible, Bible helps, Bible literature that we can share with those of you at home.
[time=865] On each telecast we make available to our listeners a special gift offer which we want you to have so that you can get into the word of God for yourself.
[time=875] For many weeks now we have been making available to you a special book called The Four Gospels arranged as a narrative.
[time=883] It is indeed a truly helpful method of studying the New Testament.
[time=887] - I think you even found it useful this week in preparation for today's sermon.
[time=891] - That's right Donna, today I'm going to be speaking on the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem that which is normally considered on Palm Sunday.
[time=901] And I found again how useful this harmony of the Four Gospels is because the triumphal entry of Christ is recorded in all four of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=912] And each of the Gospels shares a different insight into the story in order to really study it and understand it and then hopefully be able to preach it so that it's understandable.
[time=922] You need to have available all of the four narrative accounts of the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem.
[time=928] And the beauty of it is I just opened a page 167 in this book and there were all of the accounts of the triumphal entry in order with all of the information collated in exactly the right chronological sequence.
[time=941] It's a tremendous help and I know that especially during this time when we're reading the account of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, it's exciting to open this book up to the section on Christ's death and be able to read consecutively every single thing that happened from his arrest right on through to his resurrection and ascension.
[time=960] - A number of people who shared with me personally how much of help this has been to them and a number of ladies have mentioned that in their home Bible studies they have used this as a helpful tool.
[time=970] - Well, we're excited about it and we're really excited about the opportunity we have to share it with you.
[time=975] And we'd like to do that this week if you'll just write to us.
[time=978] And when you write, you need to write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, request the book on the four gospels and we'll send it to you right away.
[time=989] There's no charge for this gift.
[time=991] We send it as a way of expressing to you our appreciation for you being a part of this ministry.
[time=997] We're honest when we say that it costs a great deal for the television ministry to go on the air and to be able to be brought to you and your home.
[time=1005] And so if you can enclose a gift to help in the cost, we're grateful.
[time=1008] But we don't want anyone to feel obligated or we don't want anyone to miss out on this study tool because they don't have any money to send.
[time=1015] We trust you'll write to us this week.
[time=1017] We'd like to send this to you free and postage paid as soon as we hear from you.
[time=1021] Once again, Donna, share the address with them.
[time=1024] Just write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250
[time=1030] Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1032] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=1035] Thank you, honey.
[time=1036] Next week is Easter Sunday here.
[time=1038] And we're going to have all of our family on the telecast.
[time=1041] And I hope you'll be able to share with us this little special time so we can bring you up to date on the growth and development of the Jeremiah family.
[time=1048] It will be a special time for us and we trust it will be for you also.
[time=1052] God bless you as you continue to share the Bible hour.
[time=1054] In just a moment, we'll be opening the word together.
[time=1057] We trust you'll stay with us throughout this entire hour.
[time=1082] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=1172] Shall we take our hymnals now and turn them to hymn number 190
[time=1190] and sing a song of joy and rejoicing?
[time=1194] Rejoice, the Lord is king.
[time=1196] Hymn number 190 will change our positions and stand as we sing.
[time=1200] [MUSIC]
[time=1204] Every voice together.
[time=1206] Rejoice, the Lord is king, our own enemy, our own.
[time=1216] Rejoice, the man, sing, and cry, our prayer, our own.
[time=1224] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=1314] This song is a very typical song of the season that we are entering into and many people all around are going to be rejoicing and singing songs of rejoicement.
[time=1326] But only the true Christian can sing a song like this.
[time=1330] The Lord is our king.
[time=1332] Listen to our male do now as they sing for us, a song concerning the cross.
[time=1337] Must Jesus bear the cross alone?
[time=1340] [MUSIC - 8 seconds]
[time=1358] Must Jesus bear the cross alone?
[time=1369] And all the world go free?
[time=1379] No less a cross for everyone, and there's a cross for me.
[time=1398] How heavy are the saints of one, the one twin sorrowing here?
[time=1418] But now they taste a lingo love, and joy without a dream.
[time=1438] The consing great and thoughts I'll bear, till tears shall fail,
[time=1452] give me, and then go home like now, be true.
[time=1467] For there's a crown for me, and then go home my crown to bear.
[time=1486] For there's a crown for me, a crown for me.
[time=1497] [MUSIC]
[time=1500] Thank you, men, for your ministry to us.
[time=1508] Will you take your Bibles and turn with me now to the New Testament and the gospel according to St. Luke?
[time=1514] Luke's gospel and the 19th chapter.
[time=1518] The story, the record of the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem is recorded in all four of the gospel narratives, each of the individual writers adding some information to the completion of this record.
[time=1533] We will use for our basis and our text today, Luke chapter 19, and I'm reading, beginning at the 36th verse.
[time=1541] Luke chapter 19, beginning my reading at verse 36.
[time=1545] And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way, and when he was come near, even at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven and glory in the highest.
[time=1567] And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
[time=1572] And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
[time=1580] And when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it, saying, if thou hast known even thou at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace.
[time=1592] But now they are hidden from thine eyes.
[time=1595] For the day shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee.
[time=1608] And they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
[time=1616] And now our Father, we come into thy presence, having read thy holy word.
[time=1621] We understand our God that the knowledge and application and interpretation of the word of God belongeth unto him alone, who by his spirit can help us to know the truth.
[time=1635] We are grateful that the word of God is inspired by the spirit.
[time=1639] We are grateful that the word of God has been given to us, so that with the Holy Spirit living within us, we may read it, and it may be illuminated upon our hearts, that we may know its truth.
[time=1652] We are grateful that the Holy Spirit brings conviction to us as we read it, and as the truth pierces down into the very depths of our being, causing us to see us for what we really are, and to change our lives to bring them into conformity with the dear Son of God.
[time=1669] It is in his precious name that we pray, and for his say, amen.
[time=1675] There is a road in the city of Jerusalem, which we visited several months ago, called the Via Dolorosa, the road of sorrow.
[time=1687] It is a road which winds down the streets of the city of Jerusalem, a very narrow road.
[time=1694] With the shops and the buildings that have been there for many hundreds of years, leaping up on the side, making it perceive and look as if it were just a narrow little alley down the hillside.
[time=1709] We walked down that road, as our guide told us, that this was the way that the Lord was led to the cross outside the city of Jerusalem.
[time=1719] If you were to travel there today, you would be reminded again, as we were, that the path through Jerusalem to the cross was a path that was strewn with sorrow.
[time=1730] It is a visual reminder to us that Jesus Christ did not do all of his suffering, hanging upon the cross for those hours of his crucifixion, but he suffered many torturous agonies before that time as well.
[time=1744] We read in the 19th chapter of the book of Luke, and in the 41st verse, that the Lord Jesus Christ wept over the city of Jerusalem.
[time=1752] When he was come near, we read, he beheld the city and he wept over it.
[time=1758] When I read that passage again during this Easter season, I had to ask myself the question, did the Lord Jesus at any time ever laugh?
[time=1767] An interesting question.
[time=1769] There are some books that have been written on the humor of the Lord Jesus, and I have read some of them recently.
[time=1774] And though they point out some of the things that the Savior said that seem to be humorous in the setting, I do not believe that there is ever an exact account in the scripture that the Lord Jesus Christ ever laughed or that he was ever said to have smiled.
[time=1789] Whether our Lord smiled or not is never openly said in the scripture, though we perceive that he probably did.
[time=1798] And yet it is written of him three times in the New Testament that he wept.
[time=1803] Three different occasions we are told that the Savior cried.
[time=1807] In Luke chapter 19, in verse 41, which we have just read, we are told that he wept in compassion over the city of Jerusalem.
[time=1814] In the shortest verse in the New Testament, John 1135, we are told that Jesus wept over the death of Lazarus in compassion for the people and for his friend.
[time=1825] And in Hebrews chapter five and verse seven, we are told that that which took place in the Garden of Gethsemane, when the Lord there agonized for our souls, is here described as strong crying and tears.
[time=1839] Three times we're told that our Lord Jesus Christ wept.
[time=1844] That is an astonishing thought to me because in our generation and in our culture, it seems to be a weakness to weep.
[time=1850] I have to be honest that I have a very sensitive heart and oftentimes when things happen in our church that touch me at the core, I cannot help.
[time=1860] Myself and sometimes I cry.
[time=1863] We have some other staff members who are prone to do that on occasion.
[time=1866] I don't look at that as a sign of weakness.
[time=1868] And I believe it's in good tradition when I read of my Savior that on three occasions, he wept.
[time=1875] I'm also interested to discover in the New Testament that there were several other occasions when people are recorded to have wept.
[time=1881] When Simon Peter recognized, for instance, that he had denied the Lord Jesus Christ and it came to his consciousness what he had done.
[time=1889] The scripture says he went out and he wept bitterly.
[time=1893] The 20th chapter of the book of Acts records another experience when people wept.
[time=1898] According to that record when Paul had his meeting with the Ephesian elders at a place called Myletus, he said that they should see his face no more.
[time=1908] And according to the scriptures, the elders cried and they wept for the saying that Paul had said that they would see his face no more.
[time=1917] Numerous times in the Bible were told about people who wept.
[time=1921] But this occasion, which we have read this morning from the book of Luke, to me is the greatest occasion of weeping found any place in the Bible.
[time=1932] In fact, it is so significant that we might perhaps be more accurate if we were to call his triumphal entry, his tearful entry.
[time=1940] For the scripture says that as he was about to enter into the city of Jerusalem, he wept over the city.
[time=1948] This was a day that on the outside and to the appearance of everyone seemed to be a day that began with hope.
[time=1956] But before the day was over, it was a day of despair.
[time=1960] To those who witnessed what was to take place on this first Palm Sunday, it looked like the coronation of a king, but history witnesses to the fact that it was the beginning of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1973] What started out on this Sunday to be Jerusalem's greatest hour turned out to be Jerusalem's final hour.
[time=1981] Jesus entered Jerusalem on this Palm Sunday for the last time in a manner which should have showed that he was none other than the Messiah, the Son of David, the people who watched that experience and viewed the triumphal entry of our Savior should have known that he was coming to make Jerusalem what God intended it to be, a city of joy for the whole earth, the prophecies of the Old Testament required that it be such, and it had never yet acquired those characteristics, but now through his entering into the city and his ultimate crucifixion upon the cross, Jerusalem, the city of peace would also become the city of mercy and salvation, for out of it would flow to all mankind everywhere, the message of Christ's death upon the cross for those who would put their trust in him.
[time=2035] None of those who gathered on that eventful day should have missed the importance of the event.
[time=2040] It was unusual and unique in every way.
[time=2045] The scripture tells us that it was the only day in the life and ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ when he made any attempt at public display.
[time=2054] Never before in all of his public ministry had Jesus Christ ever courted public display.
[time=2062] Never before did he ever ride upon an animal.
[time=2065] In all of his tedious journeys throughout the land of Palestine, he walked many hundreds of miles during the days of his ministry, but on this day he rode upon a coat, and on this day he orchestrated the greatest public display that is ever recorded of his life and ministry.
[time=2084] That is one of the things that ought to tell us that this is a unique and special day.
[time=2089] For throughout his life and ministry, Jesus Christ had consistently stayed away from anything that smacked of publicity or public display.
[time=2098] In Matthew chapter 16, in verse 20, he told his disciples to tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
[time=2106] After he had raised the daughter of Jairus, we're told that he straightly charged them that no man should know of it.
[time=2114] Mark 543.
[time=2115] In Mark chapter nine, in verse nine, when he came down from the Mount of Transfiguration, he gave orders to his disciples that they should tell no man what they had seen till the Son of Man should be resurrected from the dead.
[time=2129] In John chapter six, in verse 15, we read that when Jesus therefore perceived that the multitude which he had fed would take him and by force make him king, he departed again into a solitary place for he would have none of it.
[time=2144] Matthew, in the 12th chapter of his gospel, quotes Isaiah from the Old Testament and relates this to the person of Jesus Christ and he says, he shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.
[time=2160] In other words, he would not be a public person.
[time=2163] He is not what many modern day sensationalists would make him out to be.
[time=2169] He did not strive nor reach out for public display.
[time=2173] This was a man who seemed to be more comfortable retiring in the wilderness and on the mountaintop in the darkness of the night to pray to his heavenly father.
[time=2182] And yet at this particular point in his life, he seems to be orchestrating a public display.
[time=2189] It was Jesus who asked them to go for the cult.
[time=2192] It was Jesus who caused all of this to happen as he rode into the city.
[time=2197] Why?
[time=2198] Why this sudden change?
[time=2201] Because according to the scripture, his hour had come.
[time=2204] The eyes of the whole nation were to be focused upon him, directed to him.
[time=2209] His miracles could be done in secrecy, but his death would be an open display.
[time=2215] He would die by the gate of the city on the crude Roman cross that had been constructed for his crucifixion.
[time=2221] He would have the shame of an open execution.
[time=2226] The thousands in Jerusalem and the thousands in Israel and the thousands of Passover pilgrims would see him in his flesh whom they would crucify.
[time=2236] This was Jesus' final, formal and public offering of himself to the nation as the Messiah.
[time=2244] He gave himself again to the Jewish people and his offer ended not in acceptance, but rather in execution.
[time=2253] This final offer and Jesus' knowledge of the response that would come from it caused him to weep.
[time=2262] He wept first of all over the iniquity of the city of Jerusalem.
[time=2266] In the 23rd chapter of the book of Matthew, we read seven different times when the Lord waved a roll upon the people of Jerusalem.
[time=2277] He called them hypocrites.
[time=2278] He referred to them as whitened sepulchres as something on the outside which had no corresponding reality on the inside.
[time=2286] In Matthew chapter 21, verses 10 and 11, we read that the multitudes who watched him on that day of transfiguration in Matthew's account knew all about him, knew his name, knew where he was from, knew what he claimed to be and yet it was those same people, those same people who cried Hosanna's in the streets of Jerusalem on the Palm Sunday celebration.
[time=2307] That same crowd of people who just a few days later were crying away with him, crucify him, we'll have not this man to rule over us.
[time=2316] Jesus wept because of the hypocrisy of the Jewish people.
[time=2319] He saw what they manifested themselves to be on the outside and yet he knew what they were on the inside and it caused the tears to flow from his eyes.
[time=2329] He wept also because of their sin of rejection.
[time=2332] The history of our savior and the record of the word of God is one long line of rejection.
[time=2339] Israel's history was a long line of rejecting their savior, their king.
[time=2343] Back in the Old Testament in the book of 1 Samuel, when the Israelites clamored for a king so that they could be like unto the other nations around them.
[time=2351] Finally God said unto Samuel, Samuel let them have their king.
[time=2355] They have not rejected you as my prophet priest, but they have rejected me.
[time=2360] They don't want me to rule over them.
[time=2363] It was that same spirit and that same attitude that caused the savior to say that he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[time=2370] He came into this world for the Jewish people, for those who were his chosen race.
[time=2375] And it was that race of people who rejected him and refused to accept him as their Messiah.
[time=2381] When Christ was in their midst, they refused him.
[time=2385] He was the stone which the builders rejected according to the New Testament.
[time=2389] In Matthew chapter 23 in the first gospel narrative in the New Testament, we read something of the savior's agony over the rejection that he felt from his own people.
[time=2400] If you have your Bibles, listen and read along with me in your own hearts, these words of lament from the lips of the savior, where we read, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that kill us the prophets and stonest them who are sent unto thee.
[time=2416] How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as I hen gathereth her chickens under her wing and ye would not behold your houses left unto you desolate, for I say unto you, you shall not see me henceforth to you shall say, blessed is he that comeeth in the name of the Lord.
[time=2434] Jesus said, Jerusalem, I would have gathered you as my people under my arms as I hen gathereth her chicks.
[time=2440] I wanted you to be my special people, but ye would not, they rejected him.
[time=2446] And as Jesus stood upon the hill outside of Jerusalem, just a few steps down from Bethpage, the little village from which he started his triumphal entry into the city.
[time=2456] He looked at the people of Jerusalem and in his heart, he knew that he had been rejected, and even though he would fulfill all Old Testament prophecies, he would yet again that day be rejected.
[time=2468] And he wept over the sin and the iniquity and the rejection of his people.
[time=2474] May I say to you in passing that if there are tears in heaven from the blessed savior, he must certainly be grieved as he looks out upon humanity today and sees men and women who have multiple opportunities to receive him as their own personal Messiah and yet consistently and constantly and rebelliously turn their back upon him and say as did the Jews of that first generation, we will not have this man to rule over us away with him.
[time=2502] We don't want him.
[time=2504] We will not have him to be our Messiah and our King.
[time=2507] Jesus on that triumphal Sunday wept because of the iniquity of his people, but then he wept because of their ignorance.
[time=2516] The scripture says in verse 42 of Luke 19 that they did not know.
[time=2521] Jesus said if thou had just known, what did he mean?
[time=2525] First of all, the people of Jerusalem were ignorant of the times in which they lived.
[time=2530] The whole Bible was orchestrated and constructed for this very moment.
[time=2535] And Jesus in fulfilling all of the Old Testament prophecies of this very day had to the very exact minutiae of Old Testament prophecies fallen in line with that which was predicted of this very hour.
[time=2548] Had the Jews believed their Old Testament record, had they accepted what the Bible said about their coming Messiah, they would have instantly recognized that this was the one who came in the name of the Lord and their Hosanna's would have been representative of true hearts of belief instead of just the emotion of a moment.
[time=2567] In the Old Testament, in Daniel chapter nine and verse 25, we're told that there was a time element before the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=2575] I wish I had time today to go through all of the mathematics about this.
[time=2580] But Daniel the prophet determined 69 weeks upon the people of Israel.
[time=2584] These were weeks of years, 69 weeks of years.
[time=2589] And according to the calendar and according to those who have studied it scientifically, the Jewish people on the day of triumphal entry were living in the year of the presentation of the Messiah.
[time=2600] Some scholars have even said that it was the very day which was prophesied for the coming forth of the Messiah.
[time=2607] And the Jewish people knew the Old Testament prophecy of Daniel and yet knowing that prophecy, they could not see that which was so obvious to them in front of their very eyes that this Messiah, this Jesus who was being proclaimed as the Messiah, was indeed the one for whom they looked.
[time=2623] Exactly on the very same day which he was predicted to come,
[time=2629] he came forth, they were ignorant of the time.
[time=2631] But the thing that is so astounding is that they were also ignorant of the manner of his coming.
[time=2638] If you have your Old Testament scriptures, turn back to the book of Zechariah.
[time=2642] The Old Testament prophet of Zechariah, one of the minor prophets in the Old Testament.
[time=2648] And in the ninth chapter and in the ninth verse, there is a specific prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah, the Lord Jesus.
[time=2657] Zechariah the prophet writes these words in his record, chapter nine verse nine.
[time=2663] Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[time=2667] Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[time=2670] Behold, thy king cometh unto thee, he is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt, the full of an ass.
[time=2680] This Old Testament prophecy from the lips of Zechariah said that Jesus Christ would come forth as king and that the details of his coming would be in keeping with the understanding of proper kingly attire while entering into the kingdom.
[time=2697] Jesus Christ meticulously fulfilled every part of this prophecy.
[time=2702] The Jews believed that a king would always ride upon a beast that had never been ridden by another man.
[time=2709] The Jews accepted the fact that a king would always be buried in a tomb in which never man had been laid.
[time=2716] Jesus Christ meticulously, both here and in his death and burial and resurrection fulfilled every detail of the prophecies concerning the Messiah.
[time=2726] There were a number of things on that day, that triumphful Sunday that should have signaled to the Jewish people that this was their hour, the opportunity for them to accept their Messiah.
[time=2735] First of all, the prophecy concerning the colt, but they didn't see that.
[time=2740] Then there was the name that was used.
[time=2743] Blessed is the one who cometh in the name of the Lord.
[time=2746] This was a special messianic title that was reserved for the Jewish Messiah.
[time=2751] It was sung by the people, but obviously they didn't know what they were singing.
[time=2755] And then the very song that they sang should have reminded them of their Jewish heritage that this one who had come was the Messiah according to the record, which we have read.
[time=2765] And in the other gospels were told that they sang Hosanna and that they sang the messianic Psalm, which is found in Psalm 118, verses 25 and 26.
[time=2776] It is the exact words of the song of degrees, which is found at the end of the Old Testament.
[time=2782] These songs were reserved for the pilgrims as they went their way to Jerusalem, the holy city.
[time=2788] And that very day, when Jesus entered into the city, riding upon a colt, and they were shouting his name, and they were singing the messianic Psalm that was to be sung when the king was presented in all of that, they still missed the reality of their coming Messiah.
[time=2805] And then they were waving palms.
[time=2808] Say what does that mean?
[time=2810] This is a custom which comes to us from the Old Testament Feast of Tabernacles.
[time=2814] And according to the Old Testament scriptures, the Feast of Tabernacles was designed to celebrate typically the joy and the rest of the messianic kingdom.
[time=2825] It was to be used to prefigure the time when the kingdom would be set up.
[time=2829] And so Jesus Christ was being signaled to them by the waving of the palms.
[time=2834] And when the palms were waved, the Jewish people were saying, by their actions, this is the Messiah.
[time=2840] This is the one who has come according to Old Testament prophecy.
[time=2844] In every way, that was a scene that was presented and meticulously kept in the heart of Jesus and displayed in his actions to say to those people, "I am the Savior, I am the Messiah, I have come to redeem you and to bring you out of bondage." And what does the scripture say?
[time=2866] The scripture says with all of that outward display, they did not know.
[time=2872] And that's why Jesus said, "If thou had just known the day of thy visitation." Notice verse 44 of Luke 19 says, "Thou newest not the time of thy visitation." Matthew's account says this, "All the city was moved by the coming of Jesus Christ." Listen now, all the city was moved by the coming of Jesus Christ to the extent that they ask this question, who is this man?
[time=2902] Who is this man?
[time=2904] Here were all of the outward signs of the Messiah and yet the people, the very Jews who had been instructed in the scriptures who had known all of the prophecies from the beginning to the end, when the Messiah came, they said, "Who is this man?" And some answered, "He is the prophet Jesus from the city of Nazareth," which was akin to saying, "Jesus being a very common name and prophets being found on every hand and Nazareth being a city out of which no good thing could come." Oh, he's just another prophet, they did not know.
[time=2938] We can understand the ignorance of the populace of Jerusalem.
[time=2943] We can understand somewhat the fact that they didn't know what it was that was happening, but you know, if you'll turn into your Bibles to John's account of this event, one of the most astounding things in all of the record is the fact that even the disciples were in ignorance.
[time=2958] In John chapter 12 and verse 16, we read these words.
[time=2962] John 12, 16, "These things understood not his disciples
[time=2968] at the first." What things, the events of the triumphal entry, the waving of the palms, the riding upon the colt, the singing of the song, the name of the Lord Jesus, these things, the disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified when he went back to heaven, then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him.
[time=2994] I could use the vernacular of the day that blows my mind.
[time=3000] The disciples who had lived with him, who had watched his every move, who had listened to his every word, who had heard all the prophecies of his coming death and resurrection, who knew the Old Testament scriptures, these who were closest to him, the scripture said, they didn't even understand what he was doing, and they did not accept him as the Messiah, and they missed the moment of truth when the Messiah was presented.
[time=3027] Jesus wept over the ignorance of the people.
[time=3031] Men and women were living in a day when the knowledge of the Lord and the language of Christianity and the public display of all that's religious is exploding all around us.
[time=3044] This has been called the rebirth of Christianity, and there is more known about Jesus Christ in this generation than has ever been known before and our country, called a Christian country, has available to it on every hand, the word of the Lord.
[time=3061] And yet like the Jewish people on that day when the Messiah was presented, we have all of the outward accoutments, but we don't have the inward knowledge of who Jesus is, and like the people of Jerusalem, many today, are accepting all of that, which is the pomp and circumstances of the outside without coming to grips with who Jesus Christ is, the Messiah, the one who died upon the cross for our sins and seeks to be our deliverer.
[time=3086] Jesus wept over the ignorance.
[time=3088] May I say to you, if Jesus weeps in heaven, he weeps over the ignorance of people today.
[time=3095] Lastly and briefly, he wept over the impending judgment
[time=3101] of the city.
[time=3102] In the last part of Luke's account, Jesus said, "The day shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round and keep thee in every side and lay thee even with the ground.
[time=3117] When the Lord stood on the brow of the hill, called Olivette, and he looked over the golden city called Jerusalem, who would have thought that in AD 70, 70 AD 40 years later, one generation later, the battering rams of the legions of Titus would be hammering down the gates and the walls and setting fire to the holy city in the temple of God.
[time=3143] But it happened.
[time=3144] And as Jesus looked out over that city and he saw their rejection of him as their Messiah, and he recognized that the judgment of God was to fall upon them swiftly, the scripture says, he wept.
[time=3157] He wept.
[time=3159] If Jesus weeps in heaven today for those who are on this earth, he weeps for our rejection of him.
[time=3171] He weeps for our ignorance about who he really is.
[time=3176] And oh, men and women, as he looks down the road and he sees the judgment that is to come.
[time=3181] And he recognizes that they who reject the God who is the Messiah must ultimately stand before the great white throne judgment and hear those awful words depart from me.
[time=3191] I never knew you.
[time=3193] Certainly if Jesus could weep, he would weep over that.
[time=3198] On the day when he entered in to the city, when he was to be crowned king, he was rejected.
[time=3208] Today he would enter into your heart and into your life.
[time=3212] Today he would make entrance into your being.
[time=3218] He comes by way of faith.
[time=3220] He asks you to open up your heart's door and receive him and make him the king of your life.
[time=3226] You see all around you, the reasons for doing that.
[time=3230] You see the evidence in the lives of people you know who have been changed because of the miracle of the new birth.
[time=3235] You recognize that the uniqueness of the person of Christ.
[time=3239] You see the simplicity of his gospel offer.
[time=3242] All of that you can understand.
[time=3244] But like the Jewish people, if you do not take the initiative to open up your heart's door and say I will accept him, then you have rejected him.
[time=3255] How could it be thought possible that in a day like this day, men and women gathering under the sound of the preaching of the Word of God, hearing the clear offer of Jesus Christ to be their king could reject him?
[time=3268] Shall we pray?
[time=3271] Our heads bowed and our eyes closed in this moment.
[time=3278] As you think about the message you have heard today, if you have not accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior, you may do so right now wherever you are.
[time=3286] If you're listening to my voice by way of television, right now, right as you listen, will you open your heart to receive the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=3297] Will you confess your sin?
[time=3298] Will you ask Christ to come into your life?
[time=3301] Will you pray, Lord forgive me, I know I'm a sinner.
[time=3304] I want to receive you as my Savior.
[time=3306] I want you to be the king of my life.
[time=3308] I'll not reject you, I'll accept you.
[time=3311] Come into my heart right now and be my Savior.
[time=3314] And if you do it, will you let us know?
[time=3316] We would like to send something to you that could help you in your growth as a Christian and get you started in the right direction.
[time=3323] With our heads bowed and our eyes closed here in this auditorium, I wonder how many of you here this morning would say, "Pastor, I have had the Lord Jesus Christ knocking at my door.
[time=3336] I have heard him presented in my life, but I have not accepted him.
[time=3342] I recognize now today that not to accept him is to reject him.
[time=3346] There's no middle ground, you know.
[time=3349] The best that I know how today, I'd like to receive Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=3354] I'd like to invite him into my heart.
[time=3355] I want you to pray with me.
[time=3357] Would you pray for me that I will accept him today?
[time=3360] With our heads bowed and our eyes closed, I'm going to ask that you slip up your hand.
[time=3365] By the upraised hand, I'll know that God has been speaking to your heart, and I'm going to remember you in this closing prayer.
[time=3371] Jesus came to be your Savior.
[time=3373] He wants to be your Lord.
[time=3375] He will come only by invitation, but today perhaps is the day you would invite him into your life.
[time=3381] Is there one?
[time=3382] Raise your hand, will you?
