[time=0] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=6] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geroma.
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=59] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=65] During this season of the year, we have been emphasizing in our teaching and preaching the ministry of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection.
[time=76] There is a part of His life that is often overlooked and usually passed over, and yet a part which is fraught with great meaning and instruction to us as we live in this particular age.
[time=89] That is the doctrine of His ascension, the ascended Lord.
[time=94] It is interesting as you look into the Word of God that perhaps the most important words
[time=100] the Lord Jesus Christ ever spoke were the words that He spoke to His disciples
[time=106] just before He left this earth to go back to the Father.
[time=111] And as so often, He's summarized in those few words all that He wants us to do
[time=118] as we look forward to His returning again in the future.
[time=123] In my library, there is a book with this title on the cover, "What to Do Until Jesus Comes Again." And that is the title of our study from the first chapter of the book of Acts, "What to Do Until Jesus Comes Again," as we look forward to His coming, we say with certainty even so Lord Jesus come quickly.
[time=147] Now we listen to the ministry of our choir as they continue to prepare our hearts for the ministry of the Word of God.
[time=166] [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=303] And our hearts are echoing and amen to that rendition of one of the great Psalms of the Old Testament.
[time=311] Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet a man who I want to introduce to you this morning.
[time=319] His name is Teo Block, and he comes from the island of Aruba. He has been asked by his native country
[time=329] to become their goodwill ambassador, and he is that. Teo came to know Christ because of the interest of a missionary.
[time=337] And the Lord Jesus Christ has so transformed his life that many wonderful things have happened.
[time=344] He was a very successful man. He is the ex-Vice President and Managing Director of the Spritzer and Furman Jewelers,
[time=352] one of the leading international jewelers in the world today.
[time=356] Over 37 stores and a multi-million dollar operation, Teo in essence ran that corporation.
[time=364] He was a very wealthy man. It was the jeweler that serviced the Queen of Holland with all of the crown jewels.
[time=371] And yet, there was a lack of fulfillment in his life, and the Lord Jesus Christ got a hold of him.
[time=377] He's visiting with us in our service today, and I've asked him to take just a few moments to share a bit of a testimony with you,
[time=384] and we've invited him to come back so that we can give him a great deal of time to share with you what I heard just a few weeks ago.
[time=390] That's so touched in my heart. Teo, you come and speak to us now.
[time=397] Thank you, Father, for the opportunity that I can share with your son, the Lord Jesus Christ has done in my life.
[time=408] My name is Teo Block. I was born in Indonesia in the Far East.
[time=414] Out of parents who came from Jewish background, and I never heard anything about God, I never saw a church.
[time=422] And when in 1940, we arrived in Holland, and the Germans came, our family was scattered.
[time=428] And I grew up for a great portion, going from one place to the other, and God kept us alive.
[time=434] I finished high school, graduated from college, and then graduated from the Naval Academy as a staff officer of coding communication systems.
[time=445] And I was sent out to the Far East in a guerrilla warfare.
[time=451] There, for the first time, I started wondering what was there about life?
[time=454] What was there? Because many of my colleagues who had stood before the Queen and had been commissioned and promised to give their life, left their life there.
[time=464] I was spared. I became a Catholic, thinking that that was the route to go.
[time=471] And I had a Bible, and I started reading in the Bible, and what a privilege it is today.
[time=477] That I can open this Word of God, that I found to be the only manual of life a man needs.
[time=483] But at the same time, how have I?
[time=486] Opened many times over the past 20 years, this Word, not knowing that the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness to him.
[time=495] And he cannot understand them because they are spiritually appraised.
[time=501] And I never knew that I had to be born again.
[time=504] And so after Indonesia, the Navy called me and I was sent to the Far East, from the Far East to the Far West to Curacao.
[time=513] At the time of the Korean War, almost turned into the Third World War.
[time=516] And I was a staff officer of coding communication systems for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, training, foreign commanding officers of ships
[time=524] in NATO coding communication systems.
[time=527] But after six years, I knew all a man wants to know about the Navy.
[time=531] And I quit and I started in a Jewry firm at that time with seven stores and a hundred people employed and a million dollars to earn over.
[time=539] And I was privileged after two years to become the general manager, then managing director and executive vice president of the chain of Jewry stores in the Netherlands and Tilly's.
[time=549] I also had one on a Dutch island by Oregon Manhattan.
[time=553] And we then started to build a new career.
[time=562] I always wanted to reach the top and I married.
[time=566] But very soon, communication broke down.
[time=570] And without communication, there is nothing.
[time=575] But I kept that marriage and everyone in the community saw that I was a very good husband.
[time=582] I became a Dutch Reformed because I found out one Easter when I learned that one man on the side of the Lord Jesus Christ was promised that he would be today with the Lord in Heaven.
[time=598] I left the Catholic Church, became a Dutch Reformed, had church yannity and a religion. I was forced 17 years sitting in that church, listening to the Word of God, reading, singing.
[time=609] While in my mind, this broken down communication was bothering me.
[time=614] And I can say there is no help for anyone who has marital problems unless they are first born again and get under the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=624] After 16 years, I broke up that marriage.
[time=628] And man like myself who reached the top, I was financially independent before I was 40.
[time=634] I had not one boat but three boats. You can only sail one at a time.
[time=638] But I went from one kick to the next one, always trying to get my mind off the responsibility as a manager of my household and I failed.
[time=648] And I have promised God when I was saved three years ago that I would say to anyone get the communication right.
[time=656] Many, like myself, tried to have children and I was eventually married to my two children instead of to the mother who gave me these children.
[time=666] And I divorced many years ago and turned everything I possessed over to my children and then started a bachelor's life and I remarried with Barbara who is with me here.
[time=677] I started without knowing Jesus Christ in a personal relationship and after a little while, troubles came in again.
[time=683] But then a missionary shared with me and said, "Tayo block, you are full.
[time=687] You know always where you travel in the world and you do not even know what happens if you die in two minutes.
[time=692] You don't know your final destination." And he shared with me that the wages of sin is death but a gift of God is eternal life.
[time=699] And I didn't believe that it was that easy.
[time=702] So I quit my career. My government nominated me Goodwill Ambassador for the United States Canada and Europe for the island of Aruba.
[time=709] And I started looking in this book and finally I got on my knees.
[time=714] And I said, "God, I believe man landed on the moon and I have not been there. It could have been filmed in Hollywood."
[time=722] Christians seemed to find it in this black book which is foolishness to me but make this live to me.
[time=728] And then I got to Proverbs 1-7, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge only fools despise wisdom and instruction."
[time=736] And God called me a fool and I went on reading and I got on my knees and said, "God, come in my heart." I know I have many sins but I understand now that even if I would not have any sin,
[time=747] I would still go to hell because of the same nature I inherited at the moment that I was born and come in my heart and then educate me on the Word of God.
[time=756] So that I can go out and tell the world about you because we are serving a living Savior today.
[time=762] We sometimes hear half the gospel that He died for our sins but we just celebrated that He lives.
[time=769] And I enjoy the verse of Scripture in 1 Corinthians 15, verse 17, "And if Christ had not been raised, your faith is worthless. You are still in your sins."
[time=780] But praise God He lives and He lives through each one of us. And I saw the questionnaire that you have today.
[time=787] And I had the problem, I want to tell the world about and I have the same fear as each one of you have but how easy it is if you realize that it is just telling others about Him what He did for you in your life.
[time=802] He saved me, He saved Barbara. We both went to Bible school and we could return to the island of Aruba and tell everyone around that Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lord is now our Lord and Savior.
[time=817] I was impressed with the heart of the King is like channels of water in the hands of the Lord. He turns it wherever He wishes and with not one ruler in this world where the Queen or President who is in control.
[time=831] And I can say today I am very privileged to share with you very briefly that a man who had a house, a very costly house.
[time=842] Today it could not be rebuilt for a quarter of a million dollars but it was never a home.
[time=848] I had a bed and couldn't sleep and a man like myself who are on an ego trip trying to reach the top of the world who are responsible that children grow up without a father.
[time=859] Children love your father and your mother. Parents love one another, that these children can grow up in a house where the father has time for the mother, time for the children,
[time=870] where there is a family altar and if there is anyone who is listening to my testimony who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ, get to the search chapter of John and read that you have to be born again.
[time=883] You may know the word of God for years and still be lost on your way to hell because the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life.
[time=893] And since I cannot overrun my time, you look at a man who is richer than all the industry of the United States of America and the world together because you leave behind what you have in this world and let us put a crown in heaven by telling others about him.
[time=912] We need an army for God. We need the family to be restored because the nation is as strong as the family is.
[time=920] I failed but God forgave me and I today like to speak to people. Put that family right. God is pleased if you do so and he hates divorce.
[time=931] I never knew this precious book. It is like a flower garden of God. It's all you need in life. May God bless you richly.
[time=946] And we say amen to that? Amen. He doesn't mess around, does he? That's why I like him. He just puts it straight out where you can get a hold of it.
[time=954] And we'll have him back and you can hear all the stuff that he didn't get to say that's in between the lines that will just bless your heart.
[time=960] Thank you, Teo. God bless you for your testimony. Let's hear some music now from David Miller.
[time=990] (Music)
[time=1020] We can turn to who can help us face another day.
[time=1036] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us for we need you to help us find our way.
[time=1080] Gentle shepherd, come and feed us for we need your strength from day to day.
[time=1102] There's no other we can turn to who can help us face another day.
[time=1125] Gentle shepherd, come and lead us for we need you to help us find our way.
[time=1147] Gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd, gentle shepherd.
[time=1167] We're so grateful to you for your participation in the Bible hour and we thank you for letting us take these few moments during the reception of our offering
[time=1176] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to have this personal chat with you as you watch the program there at home.
[time=1182] Last week I had all of my family with me on this time and today I have none of them.
[time=1188] We have the plague again at our house. It seems like this has been one of those kinds of winters where we just can't quite keep all of the children healthy all the time.
[time=1197] But I'm here to talk with you and their home sharing the telecast at the other end of the communication cycle.
[time=1203] During this time we like to express to you first of all our appreciation for what you're doing for us and at the same time to share with you an opportunity that you can have to enrich your own life spiritually through the use of printed materials.
[time=1219] I am very committed to the fact that God expects us to use every means possible to get out the word for our own personal growth and discipleship and following the Lord Jesus Christ in that manner.
[time=1231] And so every week during this segment of our telecast we make available to our friends at home a very special study tool that we believe will be very helpful.
[time=1240] We have been offering over these past weeks a special book called The Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=1247] We're coming down to the conclusion of this offer and this will be one of the last times that we'll be sharing this with you at home.
[time=1253] The Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative is a compendium of all of the Four Gospel narratives from the New Testament.
[time=1261] In this book are all the words of the Four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[time=1267] The difference in this tool is that they have been arranged consecutively as the events that are recorded by these words actually occurred.
[time=1275] That means that you start with the words of Christ through the Gospel writers concerning his pre-existence.
[time=1283] You move right through to Bethlehem and right on through to his ascension which is recorded in the first part of the Book of Acts and alluded to at the end of the Gospels.
[time=1292] So all of this material is in consecutive order and that means you can sit down and read through this book and as you do you will be reading the chronological life of Christ as it actually happened.
[time=1304] So you walked upon this earth. In the book are many indexes and indices and schedules and lists of things that will help you in your study of the Gospels.
[time=1314] Well I think it's one of the greatest tools and the simplest tool to use that I've ever seen.
[time=1320] I have used it extensively during these weeks of preaching on the life of Christ and found it to be a great help in the study of the Word of God.
[time=1328] Many have written back and said that they're enjoying the four Gospels and using it in their daily study time.
[time=1334] Some who are teachers and workers and other churches are using it to prepare for their teaching time.
[time=1339] And we just like to make it available to you as our free gift to you at this time.
[time=1344] And if you would like to receive your free copy I would ask you to write to me Pastor David Jeremiah and use this address post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1355] Once again that number is post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1361] As you write if you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television it's deeply appreciated but we want you to know that the book is free and if you can enclose a gift you write to us anyway and we'll be happy to send this book into your home.
[time=1374] Now during these days we're counting very heavily on all of you who are our Bible our friends to stand with us in your support of the Bible our telecast.
[time=1383] As you know just a few weeks ago we announced a very special need that we had in the television ministry.
[time=1389] Over $70,000 deficit was incurred during the past year and it had to be cared for.
[time=1395] I'm happy to report at this time that over $60,000 of that money has come in.
[time=1400] But we still have another 10,000 that we need to raise if we're going to be current in the billings of our various television stations.
[time=1409] Sometimes people wonder if all of the money they give goes directly into the ministry.
[time=1414] I want to say today that not one dime of the money you send goes to pay my salary or any of the salaries of the people who produce this program.
[time=1422] The money goes directly into the ministry and is channeled back in to sending the gospel to many more people so that they can hear the word of God.
[time=1431] When you give to the Bible our you can rest assured that all of the money you give is invested directly in the television ministry and is used by God to share the gospel of his son the Lord Jesus with many hundreds of people each week.
[time=1446] Now it is in our heart that sometime in the near future we may be able to add another station to this network.
[time=1451] But we cannot even begin to think about doing that until first of all we meet the challenge that is before us.
[time=1458] Perhaps some of you have been meeting to write to me and just have put it off.
[time=1462] Some of you may be thinking well perhaps they'll make their goal without my help.
[time=1466] Whatever the reason that you haven't written put that aside and sit down right now and write us a letter.
[time=1472] When you write and close a gift as much as you can give to help in the Bible our ministry during these days.
[time=1478] Your gifts are tax deductible and we will send you a receipt and a letter of thanksgiving for your part in helping to keep the Bible our on the air.
[time=1486] Every once in a while we hear from somebody brand new that we've never met before and they send us a substantial gift.
[time=1492] They remind us that there are many people who watch the Bible our each week who are capable of doing a great deal to help us if they will just be willing to do it.
[time=1501] We believe the Bible our is one of the most sensible programs on the air.
[time=1505] We don't spend the time in the service promoting we don't spend the time in the service trying to raise money except for this one section during the Offertory here at our own church.
[time=1514] But we believe also that is not only sensible but worthy of your support.
[time=1519] If you believe in what we're doing we trust that you'll stand with us during these days.
[time=1523] I need to hear from you this week and I hope you'll write.
[time=1526] Just a few moments I'm going to be teaching from the Book of Acts a subject that's often forgotten the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ and what it means to us today.
[time=1536] And I trust you'll stay with us with your Bible ready and a pencil in hand so that you can take some notes as we open the Word of God to study together this great truth.
[time=1566] [MUSIC]
[time=1579] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1581] We're asking our men to come now and they're going to sing a duet for us.
[time=1585] It's a beautiful song entitled "Lead Me, O Lord, Lead Me." I trust that's your prayer this morning as they sing for us right now.
[time=1595] [MUSIC]
[time=1605] God is the role that lies before me. How can I find my way?
[time=1624] [MUSIC]
[time=1652] Ever will I go astray, O Lord?
[time=1661] Lead me, O Lord, lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1679] Dangers I'm lurking, foes are threatening.
[time=1688] Satan his power has shown.
[time=1697] Stay by my side, protect and guide me.
[time=1707] I do not want to know.
[time=1716] Lead me, O Lord, lead me.
[time=1725] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=1734] Lead me, O Lord, lead me.
[time=1743] Lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1752] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=1761] Lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1769] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=1784] Thank you, men.
[time=1785] As you know, we had some additional music planned, and we're going to postpone that until another time so that we can get into the Word of God, and you'll hear a star sing again, maybe twice, next Sunday.
[time=1796] And I'm sure she'll understand that. We need to spend our time in the Word today, so let's open our Bibles to the Book of Acts and the first chapter, Acts chapter 1.
[time=1808] It is not with any apology whatsoever that I say the most important thing that we do in this church
[time=1815] is to open the Word of God together.
[time=1817] I am not the most important person because of that, but I have the most important task, and we don't ever want to do anything that will, in any way, take away from the importance of God's truth.
[time=1828] For it is the Word of God which he has promised to bless to the salvation of souls.
[time=1832] The Book of Acts chapter 1, and I hope you'll follow in your Bibles as I introduce our subject today
[time=1838] for the reading of this portion of Scripture.
[time=1840] The former treatise have I made Otheophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
[time=1846] until the day in which he was taken up after that he, through the Holy Ghost, had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen.
[time=1853] To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs,
[time=1859] being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father which, sayeth he, ye have heard of me.
[time=1874] For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit, not many days hence.
[time=1881] When they therefore were come together, they ask of him saying, Lord, we'll now at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel, and he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power,
[time=1895] but ye shall receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
[time=1907] And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
[time=1914] And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold two men stood by them in white apparel,
[time=1920] which also said, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven, this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.
[time=1934] And our Father, we pray that ye will make these words to be words that burn into our hearts, the last words of our Savior spoken while on this earth.
[time=1944] We pray that we shall not in any way diminish their importance because of the time that has passed since they were spoken.
[time=1950] They have been preserved for us in this book we call the Bible, that we may read them and heed them, and put them into practice every day of our lives.
[time=1960] We thank you our Father that you use the Word of God to focus and sharpen our perspective on life,
[time=1966] and to give us instruction into how to live during these days as we wait for the Savior.
[time=1972] We pray that you will use your Word in every heart this morning to accomplish its desired end.
[time=1977] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1982] Most of the modern histories of the life of Christ have two glaring faults.
[time=1987] They start too late, and they quit too soon.
[time=1992] They start at Bethlehem, which is only one portion of the life of the Lord Jesus, and they omit the pre-existence of Christ.
[time=1999] And they end at Olivet, and they omit the ascension and the present session of Christ in heaven.
[time=2007] In Luke's preface to the book of Acts, which we have read this morning, he says these words.
[time=2012] He says that in his gospel that he is about to write, in the gospel which he wrote, the gospel of Luke,
[time=2018] that he treated all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up.
[time=2026] He says in verse 2, "O Theophilus, all that Jesus began both to do and teach."
[time=2032] The book of Luke is the record of all that Jesus started to do.
[time=2037] Now the book of Acts is what he continued to do through his apostles, and the epistles which were written by Paul and others are the record of what he continued to teach.
[time=2048] The epistles are the teachings of Christ, and the book of Hebrews and the book of Revelation is a wondrous glimpse into the Lord's life in heaven.
[time=2058] So we have in the introduction to the book of Acts our Lord's perspective on what he is about to say.
[time=2063] He said, "In the book of Luke is written for you all that Jesus began both to do and to teach."
[time=2069] The book of Acts is the continuation of what he began to do through his apostles after he left his earth.
[time=2075] The epistles are what he continued to teach through the instruction which was written down.
[time=2080] Hebrews and Revelation gives us a glimpse into the future.
[time=2084] We could very well say that the book of Acts is the book of the acts of the ascended Lord,
[time=2090] the book of the acts of the ascended Lord, what he is doing today through his church, what he desires to do until he comes back for his own.
[time=2099] And we have here, in these few words that we have read, the most important words that our Lord spoke to his disciples after his resurrection.
[time=2109] Now it is interesting that when the disciples are gathered together with the Lord and he is in his resurrection body, the resurrection has been accomplished that they would want to ask some questions.
[time=2118] Had you been there, you would have asked some too.
[time=2120] And it is also interesting that the question that they ask would probably be precisely the question you would ask.
[time=2127] The question is recorded in the sixth verse and it's this.
[time=2130] When they were come together, they ask him saying, "Lord, will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
[time=2136] They had thought that was going to happen before, but he was taken to the cross and crucified and they thought the kingdom hopes were dashed to pieces.
[time=2144] But then he went to the grave and he was resurrected and now he is in his resurrection body and the disciples thought, "Perhaps now he will bring in the kingdom.
[time=2152] Perhaps now he will set himself up in the Messianic kingdom and become our visible Messiah and lead us out of bondage."
[time=2159] And they wanted to know if that was going to happen.
[time=2162] And the Lord Jesus did what many master teachers did.
[time=2165] He answered their questions by not answering their question.
[time=2168] He said in verse 7, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the fathereth put in his own power."
[time=2176] Now that was the Lord's way of saying, "It's none of your business." He's saying, "It's not for you to know when that's going to happen." I suppose that was a bit frustrating to the apostles.
[time=2186] I imagine that that just really left them hanging on the edge of their chairs wanting to know more.
[time=2192] And you know that that's not the end of what the Lord is going to say.
[time=2196] He's got something else that he wants to say to them and it's just so interesting to me how he did it.
[time=2201] In essence he was saying, "Men who are going to carry on my ministry, don't be worried about the times and the seasons,
[time=2208] but let me tell you what you should be concerned about." And then he outlined a three-fold plan which I believe is still in operation today.
[time=2218] He gave to them three instructions that ought to be burned into the heart of every Christian who names the name of Christ in his life and testimony.
[time=2227] He told the disciples what he wanted them to do and in telling them what he wanted them to do, he tells us what he wants us to do.
[time=2235] I believe in the teaching and preaching of prophecy. I believe it's one of the great, great things God has given to us the prophetic word.
[time=2241] But sometimes I see people getting so prophetically minded they forget that God is something for us to do today.
[time=2247] And I believe he has given us here the perspective that he wants us to have.
[time=2251] It's not for you to know the times of the season, but here's what I want you to do as you wait for my return.
[time=2257] And the first thing that he said to them was this, "As you wait for my return, as you wait for that kingdom to be set up, I want you to witness with power.
[time=2265] Whenever the church has done this in response to the Lord's command, it has gone forth with a banner wave tied terrible as an army.
[time=2275] Whenever it has responded to Acts chapter 1-8, which says, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me.
[time=2281] The church has been strong, and it has filled the world with its doctrine.
[time=2285] And whenever it is defected from her calling, she has been put in bondage.
[time=2290] All over the world today, there are those who want to replace the challenge to witness with power with learning.
[time=2296] And though I believe in education, it can never replace the challenge that Christ gave to his disciples to be witnesses into all the world.
[time=2303] Some want to replace it with reform and renewal, and we're living in great days for the renewal of the church.
[time=2309] As long as it does not lose sight of its ultimate goal, and that is the evangelization of a lost world, renewal is good.
[time=2316] But if it replaces evangelism, it will be the defection of the church and disobedience to the commands of Christ.
[time=2323] There are some today who want to replace evangelism in the church with ecclesiastical order and programs and material projects.
[time=2330] All of these things may be good, but if they take the place of God's instruction to us in these last words he spoke while upon this earth,
[time=2338] it will be the demise of the church and already signs of death or about us.
[time=2343] Jesus said you are to witness in power.
[time=2346] And then he broke it down very clearly, first of all to tell them the subject of their witness.
[time=2352] He said you are to be witnesses unto me, not unto the church, not unto doctrines that may be your pet theories,
[time=2358] not unto the divisive things which show rack our fellowship today, but you're to be witnesses to me.
[time=2364] Jesus Christ is the subject of our witness.
[time=2367] We are to witness that He is in His life, our righteousness, and that He is in our death, in His death, our atonement,
[time=2375] that He is in His resurrection, our power, and that He is in His ascension, our acceptance with the Father.
[time=2381] We are to be witnesses unto Christ.
[time=2384] It is a personal testimony unto Him.
[time=2387] And He says we are to do it personally.
[time=2390] He not only tells us the subject of our witness, but He tells us the sphere of our witness.
[time=2396] And we have touched on this so many times in our delineation of the gospel call.
[time=2400] He tells us that we are to be witnesses in three areas, in three concentric circles.
[time=2405] And then He summarizes it all up by saying unto the uttermost parts of the world.
[time=2409] We are to witness at home.
[time=2411] And then we're to broaden that witness, and finally to broaden that witness to the whole world.
[time=2415] Jesus said we are responsible to witness with power to the entire earth in our generation.
[time=2421] I don't believe that is a command which resides upon all succeeding generations.
[time=2426] I believe it's a command that He gave to the apostles and He expected it to be carried out during their lifetime.
[time=2431] I believe He's given that same command to us, and He expects us in our lifetime to have a testimony to the entire world.
[time=2438] Black Hawk Baptist Church and its community is not our parish.
[time=2442] Fort Wayne is not our domain.
[time=2444] Indiana is not our territory.
[time=2446] We as individuals are responsible for the evangelization of the entire world.
[time=2450] We are to do it by word in the confession of our lips.
[time=2457] We are to do it by writing in the circulation of literature.
[time=2461] We're to do it in any way possible, but we are to witness, and the spear of our witness is the world.
[time=2467] And then He tells them that the source of our witness is the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2473] Thank God for that.
[time=2474] It's not in our power.
[time=2476] I'm tired many times, but I'm grateful that the source of my strength is the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2482] He says, "You are to be witnesses unto Me, and ye shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."
[time=2488] And just a few days hence, from that statement, the Holy Spirit came and embodied the church.
[time=2494] And every Christian who is witnessing today is witnessing because of that same Holy Spirit who embodied the church and embodies every Christian.
[time=2502] And we go out in the power of the Spirit to witness, and because of that men and women are born into the family of God.
[time=2508] Jesus said, "First of all, while you're waiting for Me to return, witness with power.
[time=2514] Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel." Someone is written, "Away with a faithless plea that cannot abide the light.
[time=2524] Be holy for Christ, and He will teach you to speak of right.
[time=2528] His love will supply the power, the measure, the mode, and the theme.
[time=2534] You have but the present hour, O spend every breath for Him."
[time=2540] What to do until the Lord comes back, first of all, witness with power.
[time=2545] William Carey in 1786 was about to launch the modern missions movement, and he stood up in a meeting and he said,
[time=2552] "Whether the command given to the apostles to teach all the nations is obligatory to us and succeeding ministries to the end of the world is my question."
[time=2560] In other words, did Jesus mean to us today in this generation that we were to preach the gospel to the whole world?
[time=2567] One of the older statesmen in that missionary meeting, a fellow by the name of Dr. Ryland, stood up and he said, "You are a miserable enthusiast for asking such a question." As I read that story again this week, I was reminded that almost everybody I know in the Christian faith is either a William Carey or a Dr. Ryland.
[time=2585] They're either enthusiastic about evangelism and trying to win the world, or they're like Dr. Ryland saying, "Come down, don't be so excited about that. You're just a miserable enthusiast." We'll praise God, let us be a group of miserable enthusiasts.
[time=2597] Let us take seriously the command that while we wait for the risen Lord to return, we have been commanded to witness
[time=2605] and to share the gospel with every creature in evangelism and television and Sunday school growth in the preaching services in every way possible, we are to witness with power.
[time=2615] And when we fail to do that, we are failing to be obedient to the command of the Lord Jesus Christ to every Christian.
[time=2622] Are you a William Carey or are you a Dr. Ryland?
[time=2626] Secondly, in this passage of Scripture, we see the second prong of our threefold approach to life while we wait for the Savior.
[time=2637] We are not only to witness by power, but we are to walk by faith.
[time=2641] Verse 14 says this, I'm sorry, verse 9 says this, "And when they had spoken these things, while they be held,
[time=2650] he was taken up and a cloud, notice, received them, received him out of their sight.
[time=2658] The one that they had come to love, the one that they had touched and handled and embraced and felt and listened to
[time=2665] and seen with their own eyes was now taken up out of their midst, out of their sight."
[time=2673] Is that not a testimony to us in the very example that we have in this record of our ascended Lord?
[time=2678] That in this generation, we must now walk by faith, not by sight.
[time=2684] It was just shortly after that that we read these words, "Henceforth, know we know man after the flesh, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we him no more after the flesh."
[time=2695] That's our situation.
[time=2697] The apostles and the disciples and those who walked with him knew him after the flesh, but we do not know him after the flesh.
[time=2703] I have not seen the Lord in his risen body. I have not talked with him in a physical sense, though I pray to him every day
[time=2709] and commune with him. I have not seen him after the flesh, but I believe in him through the eyes of faith.
[time=2715] And the Bible says, "I am to walk by faith in this generation and in this parentheses between the ascension of our Lord and his return."
[time=2723] Over and over again in the New Testament, we are reminded of that truth.
[time=2727] You remember Thomas when he doubted, and finally when the Lord became real to him through the opportunity
[time=2734] that the Lord gave him to thrust his hands into the side and into the prince of his hands, and the Lord Jesus said to him in the Gospel of John, he said, "Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.
[time=2745] Blessed are those who have not seen and still believe." I'm in that second blessed category, and so are all of you.
[time=2755] And Peter, I think perhaps standing by, though it is not in the same passage, Peter standing by hearing those words must have written down this phrase.
[time=2763] He said, "Whom having not seen ye love." Though now you see him not yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[time=2773] And that's our situation. We walk by faith.
[time=2778] And you know sometimes we don't like that, do we?
[time=2782] We're standing now on the threshold of one of the greatest projects we've ever undertaken as a church.
[time=2788] And it almost staggers my mind to think of the perspective.
[time=2791] I wish the Lord Jesus would just come down sometimes and sit in our meeting and write out the plan for us.
[time=2796] Here's how it's to be done, but we walk by faith.
[time=2800] After he returned to glory, I'm confident that many of the disciples on their road back to Jerusalem must have thought
[time=2807] how dismal life would be without the physical presence of the Lord.
[time=2811] And they remembered the cloud that took him up out of their midst.
[time=2814] Perhaps one of them may have said, "Did not we return to Jerusalem with joy even though the cloud took him from us?"
[time=2822] And has he not told us that he will never leave us nor forsake us?
[time=2826] Has he not said to us that though he may be physically absent from us, he is spiritually present with us in the person of the Holy Spirit and he has promised never to leave us?
[time=2835] And so the writer of Hebrews could say, "I will never leave thee so that we will boldly say I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
[time=2845] I'm aware of the fact that in our lives today in this very week there are clouds that come that would cloud the Savior from our midst and from our eyes.
[time=2854] Cloud him out of our vision, sometimes it's the cloud of grief, sometimes it's the cloud of difficulty and family problems,
[time=2861] sometimes it's the cloud of financial straits and difficulties and those clouds sometimes can blur our vision of the Lord.
[time=2868] I'm sure that's what was in the heart of the songwriter who wrote the words to the song "Son of My Soul."
[time=2874] In one of the verses he writes these words, "Oh may no earthborn cloud arise to hide thee from thy servant's eyes."
[time=2884] That's our prayer. Lord we walk by faith and don't let any cloud from this earth arise that will blot you out from our eyes.
[time=2891] We want to keep the totally in view.
[time=2894] And another songwriter who wrote the words of "on Christ the solid rock I stand" wrote these words.
[time=2900] He wrote, "When darkness hides his lovely face, I rest on his unchanging grace."
[time=2906] There are clouds that come into every Christian's life just as that cloud that received him up out of the midst of the disciples,
[time=2913] that if we're not careful can blot him out of our view and keep him from our perspective.
[time=2917] But he is present with us and we are to walk by faith day by day even though he has been received out of our sight.
[time=2923] He is in our spiritual sight and the word of God tells us that as Christians we are to live every day by faith believing in him and trusting in him
[time=2933] and walking as if he were present physically with us because he is just as present with us through the principle of faith.
[time=2942] And we can certainly say if we have experienced his presence in our life that we'd rather walk in the darkness with him than to go by ourselves in the light.
[time=2951] We're to walk by faith.
[time=2953] If we had time today we would turn in our Bibles to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and the last few verses of that chapter remind us
[time=2960] that we do not live on the basis of those things which are seen but on the basis of those things which are unseen.
[time=2966] And we rest our hope and our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ who has become very real to us.
[time=2972] Last but not least in this threefold instruction to his disciples by word and example,
[time=2978] the Lord Jesus said to them you are not only to witness by power, not only to walk by faith but you are to wait in hope.
[time=2986] To wait in hope, what does that mean?
[time=2988] Notice what he says in verses 10 and 11.
[time=2991] In this record of the ascended Christ we read and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven and this is a passage which means they
[time=2999] gazed, they fixed their attention on that cloud when Jesus was taken out of their midst.
[time=3003] Two men stood by them and white apparel and this was their message.
[time=3007] They said ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven?
[time=3013] This same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.
[time=3022] Our third instruction from this experience of our Lord is that we are to wait in hope.
[time=3027] As the disciples and apostles looked up at that cloud that took their Savior from them with an expectancy that perhaps he would at that moment
[time=3035] reappear we as Christians in this generation are to fix our eyes upon the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ and wait in hope for his coming.
[time=3045] In the passage which Pastor Rick read for us a few moments ago he read these words,
[time=3051] these instructions from Paul to the Thessalonians he read, he turned to God from idols to serve the living in the true God and to wait for his son from heaven.
[time=3061] Isn't that a beautiful presentation of our instruction, to serve the living in the true God and to wait for his son from heaven.
[time=3068] The waiting keeps the serving from becoming drudgery.
[time=3072] When I'm serving the Lord and I know he's soon coming even though the work gets tough and the drudgery is there it keeps it from becoming drudgery
[time=3079] because I know he could break the clouds at any moment and come back for his own.
[time=3084] And the serving keeps the waiting from degenerating into luxury and idleness even though I might get excited about the Lord Jesus coming back if I don't serve him
[time=3093] then I could just sit around and do nothing and there are a lot of folks who do that today.
[time=3096] They're so caught up in the coming of Christ they don't do a blessed thing for the Lord during the time they're waiting.
[time=3102] Jesus says we're to wait because he is coming back.
[time=3106] I wish I had time to develop all that's in this passage concerning his return.
[time=3110] But you know Jesus has given us a good perspective on his coming again just by saying that he's going to come back in like manner as he went.
[time=3120] What does that mean? How is he going to come back?
[time=3123] Well the Scripture says he's going to come back to us just as he went from us.
[time=3127] And that teaches us an awful lot about the second coming of Christ.
[time=3131] When he went into glory from his disciples his going was personal so shall his coming be.
[time=3139] He said the Lord himself shall descend 1 Thessalonians.
[time=3143] When he went from his disciples his going was physical so shall his coming be.
[time=3150] We look for a Savior the Lord Jesus who shall change our vile bodies like unto his own glorious body.
[time=3157] He's coming back physically just as he went from us physically.
[time=3161] He went in a cloud and the Bible says he's coming back in a cloud.
[time=3166] He shall appear in the clouds of heaven behold he come with clouds says the Scripture.
[time=3172] When he went he rose from Mount Olivet and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.
[time=3178] He went last from the midst of his own and he shall at his appearing gather his own about him and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[time=3186] In like manner.
[time=3188] And those disciples who saw him go had a mute testimony of how he would return again.
[time=3194] The Lord so wonderfully preserved that picture an example of his coming back that as they saw him go from them.
[time=3199] It would almost be as if they could put the motion picture in reverse and see him come again.
[time=3205] He is coming.
[time=3207] And the Lord Jesus said to them by that example while I'm gone.
[time=3211] While you're waiting for me to come back and they expected it eminently.
[time=3215] I want you to witness with power.
[time=3218] I want you to walk by faith and I want you to wait in hope.
[time=3223] The poet is written he is coming this same Jesus.
[time=3227] Sweet the thought that soon the day with its beams of light shall banish earth's dark shadows far away.
[time=3234] This same Jesus he is coming.
[time=3237] I shall see him face to face in the saint thronged courts of heaven he has given me a place.
[time=3244] He is coming.
[time=3246] And who is it that so cometh in like manner?
[time=3249] It is this same Jesus.
[time=3251] Blessed assurance Jesus is mine.
[time=3255] I need not wish that I had seen him in the days of his humiliation.
[time=3261] He is the same Jesus who comes again.
[time=3265] He either need I be in deadly fear of his presence.
[time=3268] If he is the same Jesus who comes just as he went I will be able to see him and know him and sense his presence without fear.
[time=3276] And so I say to the one who has said surely I come quickly.
[time=3280] Even so Lord Jesus come.
[time=3283] He went from us that he might come back to us.
[time=3287] In the meantime I witness with power and I walk by faith and I wait in hope for my Savior to return shall we pray.
[time=3303] Father it would take many many minutes to unfold the great truth of this wonderful passage of thy word.
[time=3309] We have only hit the very high spots of your words an example to your loved ones.
[time=3315] Before you left this earth and we recognize it is a preview of your coming back and we say even so Lord Jesus come quickly.
[time=3322] As we pray with anticipation and excitement we recognize that some listening to our voice today are not ready for that coming.
[time=3330] Some who here in this auditorium have not made preparation for the coming again of Christ.
[time=3335] Some out of our television who do not know Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=3339] Speak to them in these closing moments we pray that they might come to know him whom to know his life eternal.
[time=3347] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior will you bow just now this very moment and say Lord Jesus come into my life forgive my sin.
[time=3355] I want to be ready when you return.
[time=3357] I want to be a part of those who are caught up to be with the Lord and today I want to make sure that things are right between me and the...
[time=3365] If you pray in earnest prayer and ask Christ to come into your life and forgive your sin he'll do it and he'll become your Savior right now.
[time=3373] Right here in this auditorium as you sit there in the chair you can do it at home as you listen to my voice you can do it.
[time=3381] But will you do it? Will you invite him to come in? Father we pray that many will do that now.
