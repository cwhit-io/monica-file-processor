[time=13] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=23] [MUSIC]
[time=49] >> And thank you for the good singing you may be seated.
[time=75] We welcome all of our friends at home who have joined us now
[time=82] by television to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=86] And we are so pleased that today the dimensions and brass from the Grace College in Winona Lake, Indiana have come back for their annual visit to our fellowship.
[time=96] And they are going to be sharing music with us throughout the first part of this service today.
[time=102] In a few moments, we're going to be opening the Word of God to the Book of Acts and looking again at the pattern, which is our guide in the formulation of a New Testament church.
[time=116] What makes a great church?
[time=118] Well, great churches are churches that follow what God has to say about the church from the New Testament.
[time=125] Some new and exciting insights from the Book of Acts will give us some goals
[time=131] for which to shoot and some guides by which we may live our lives in the fellowship of this church.
[time=137] And I know God is going to use His Word to challenge all of our hearts today.
[time=141] First of all, though, we want to introduce to you officially the dimensions in brass from Grace College.
[time=147] And in this first section of music, they are going to be playing for us.
[time=151] A mighty fortress is our God.
[time=153] And then a hymn entitled "Like a River Glorious." Sometimes we wonder when we have guests that move our spirits and our hearts, as these folks do, whether it is right in the setting of worship for us to express our appreciation.
[time=170] I would encourage you to withhold your applause until the first package is done.
[time=175] And if you want to, you clap your hands as unto the Lord and thank Him for the blessing of music in your own heart.
[time=183] The dimensions in brass from Grace College with Jerry Frank's leading.

[time=570] [ Applause ]
[time=581] >> We really do appreciate you joining us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=585] And we are especially excited about this few moments that we have done during the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church to step aside and talk with you very personally as you watch at home.
[time=596] Donna, we have had a great time recently as a staff as we have had an opportunity to get away and reflect upon all that God has been doing and all that we anticipate He is going to do in the future.
[time=606] And that has been kind of a neat experience, hasn't it?
[time=609] >> It really has.
[time=610] It is kind of good once in a while just to step back from all of the activity and set yourselves apart and have a special time communicating with the Lord and also making the plans and following the plans that He has for us for the future.
[time=622] >> And while all of the staff men worked, all of the staff wives went shopping.
[time=626] That worked out pretty good too.
[time=628] >> Except for the pocketbook.
[time=629] It was kind of hard on that.
[time=631] >> Well, we do have a great time together as a ministry team here.
[time=635] And so many of the people that you very seldom see are just a great part of the ministry of the Bible Hour and we appreciate them so much.
[time=643] During these last days we have been emphasizing a special recovery project and we have been telling you about it and appreciating all of you have been involved in it.
[time=652] Today is the last day that I am going to talk about that on the insert.
[time=656] I just want to give you a brief report.
[time=659] As of this date we have received over $61,000 in response to this project
[time=665] and we are just overwhelmed at your response to what God has done in your hearts and what He continues to do here in the life of this church and its ministry.
[time=673] Let me remind you that if you still have your letter sitting on the desk and you mean to do something, why not sit down this week and send that envelope back to us so that you can be included in the final total of this recovery project.
[time=685] In a few days we are going to be sharing with you some new and exciting ideas that God has placed within our hearts for the continuation of the ministry of the Bible Hour on many stations.
[time=695] And I know that you will want to be hearing about that as you look for ways to help keep the Bible Hour going strong where you hear it and see it in your area.
[time=704] Donna we have been almost overwhelmed by the response to the gift offer
[time=710] that we have been sharing with our friends at home during recent days.
[time=714] I don't think we have ever had any response at all like the one we have had to this offer
[time=720] from anything else that we have made available to our friends.
[time=723] Why don't you just bring us up to date quickly on the nature of this special gift offer?
[time=728] This is an especially important tool if you are a Bible student and enjoy studying the word.
[time=734] This book is the Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative and it puts the Four Gospels in chronological order as the events happened.
[time=744] And I was trying to think of some things that we might share about the book that we haven't in the past
[time=750] and I think one of the things that we have not dealt well done very much is the index in the back.
[time=756] And that's a very handy tool if you are looking for a particular passage you just have to turn to the back and look up that particular subject.
[time=763] For instance on this particular page it has the hidden treasure, the pearl of great price, conditions for following Christ, two blind men receive their sight.
[time=772] And that's really handy if you are not well versed in the scriptures or even if you are sometimes it's hard to put your finger on an event.
[time=779] Have you ever had somebody say I know there is a story in the Bible about and then they can't remember even the key words and as you brainstorm about it together you remember that it has something to do with the treasure.
[time=789] You can go to the back of that book and look up that word and it will give you a page number when you turn in the gospels in this little booklet to that page number all of the material in all four gospels about that event will be there for you to study.
[time=803] It's arranged chronologically that is it starts at the beginning in time and space and it moves all the way through the life of our Lord.
[time=811] And every word of all four gospels is here only it's just arranged chronologically.
[time=816] We have had so many people come back and say what a blessing it has been just to read through this book
[time=822] let alone the study of it in preparation for Sunday school classes etc.
[time=827] We want you to have it as our free gift.
[time=830] It's our way of extending the ministry of the Bible hour into your home and we offer it to you with no conditions whatsoever it is absolutely free.
[time=838] We send it to you as our way of expressing our appreciation to you for watching the Bible hour.
[time=843] We do hasten to add that many are able and excited about sending gifts to help with the Bible hour
[time=849] and we appreciate that but we don't want anyone to miss out on this Bible study tool because they feel they can't give an offering.
[time=856] When you write to request your free copy of the four gospels you need to write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=867] Once again the address is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=875] When you address your letter that way it will get to our office as soon as we hear from you.
[time=880] It will be our privilege to send that book your way so that you can get involved in studying it.
[time=884] Please allow a couple of weeks for delivery to your home since we have a backlog of mail
[time=891] that is just very difficult to keep up with each day but you should receive your book within two weeks.
[time=896] Thank you again for being a part of our telecast today.
[time=899] I know you're enjoying the band from Grace College in just a few moments.
[time=903] I'm going to be speaking on the subject of the first church and what it has to say to the church today.
[time=911] You want to have your Bibles open to the book of Acts and be ready to study along with us and stay with us now for the remainder of the Bible Hour.
[time=918] Before we return to our service let me remind you just one more time that the address you need to have on your envelope when you write for the free book is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=941] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=1070] That was tremendous singing. You may be seated.
[time=1073] It's a beautiful, beautiful hymn. It says so very, very much.
[time=1077] I wanted to make sure that you heard the words just before the dimensions in brass play now of the music.
[time=1084] They have a special arrangement of that hymn and can it be that they're going to play for us right now.
[time=1089] Then Tammy Hyelman is going to come there, Soprano soloist, and she's going to join the dimensions in brass
[time=1097] as they sing and play for us a song "If My People." Now the dimensions in brass.
[time=1104] [MUSIC - 383 seconds]
[time=1504] Thank you all of you who have participated in sharing some glorious music with us. And we want to encourage those of you who are in this area and are seeing the service that we're sharing here in our auditorium on channel 21. That tonight at 6.30, the grace, and the grace that we're sharing here.
[time=1518] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=1576] "Then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls. And they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
[time=1599] And all that believed were together and had all things common. They sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily, such as should be saved.
[time=1628] Shall we bow together in prayer? Our Father in Heaven, we are so grateful that we have before us the pattern of truth. We do not have to read books on the church to find out what it ought to be. Thou hast given to us thine own word.
[time=1648] As really as if God did sit down and write a letter to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, thou hast given to us the instruction for all that should be happening here in our midst as a part of our fellowship.
[time=1660] We thank you, Father, that the word of God changes not. And though the implementation of these structural commands may change with the culture and society in which we minister, the basic bedrock foundation is just the same as it was when it was communicated back in the early days.
[time=1677] In the early days of the foundation of the church, open our eyes to this truth. Father, where we have strayed from the pattern, bring us back again, where we see that our emphasis may be different than that of the emphasis of the New Testament help us to recover.
[time=1694] In every way, that emphasis which is in the heart of God, for more than anything else, O God, we want our church to be, that which God would have it to be. We want it to be a New Testament church in every way, following as closely as possible the pattern that God has set forth in his word.
[time=1712] And so we covet your blessing upon our time of instruction today that we may be learners and we may be obedient to the word. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1725] During these last days, it has been the opportunity of the staff and Board of Deacons of this church to set aside some quality time and to reflect upon what God has done in our midst in the past and to
[time=1741] continue. Once again, begin to think about vision for the future.
[time=1748] All over this country, there are churches that have attained the level of growth that we have enjoyed, and when they get to this particular station, they seem to somehow level off and never break through the barrier into the next stage of church growth.
[time=1764] We have been examining some of the statistics in our own church, and we recognize unless we take seriously the commands of the Word of God to go into all the world and preach the gospel, discipling those who believe, we could fall prey to the same syndrome of leveling off at this particular place in the growth of our fellowship.
[time=1785] When one begins to consider all of these things, and especially when you can draw aside from the rush and schedule that is so dominant in your life and sit down with the men of the staff, and then later with the men of the Board of Deacons who form the leadership team of our church and ask some questions,
[time=1806] you can begin to see that it is very easy over the life of a church to move in one direction or the other and get away in just some small way from the basic elements that make a church what it ought to be.
[time=1821] I'm so grateful to the Lord that I don't have to bring in some church growth consultant and have him sit here and tell us what we need to be doing in these next months.
[time=1830] I don't have to go and talk to somebody who's done it or have some spectacular personality come back and say this is what you ought to be doing.
[time=1838] I can turn again to the pages of the New Testament and the book called Acts where we have God's instruction for the local church,
[time=1845] and I can open that book and see again those basic elements which belong to us because we're a part of this organism,
[time=1852] and as we do that we can let that be the looking glass through which we examine everything that's going on in our fellowship.
[time=1859] We can ask all of the right questions and we can refocus our direction and say this is what God would have us to do.
[time=1866] We are standing now as a church in one of the most precarious positions.
[time=1871] We are in that in-between stage.
[time=1873] Here we are crowded into a building that is too small for us with parking facilities that are not adequate.
[time=1879] A Sunday school space that is borrowed from the junior high school across the street and parking in three lots.
[time=1885] We recognize that God has called us to a building that's over in the promised land a few miles away from here.
[time=1891] We're looking forward to that but we're a long way removed from it by way of time.
[time=1895] And so there is a tendency for us as a church and as a congregation to say well when we get over there then things will be alright.
[time=1903] But as we have met together this week in prayer and in study and in meditation and in fellowship with one another,
[time=1910] we have come to the place where we are deeply committed to the fact that if there are no days in Arlington, if there were no future ahead of us we need to be doing what God would have us to do now.
[time=1920] And we need to do it in every aspect of our lives and every aspect of the life of our church.
[time=1926] And we need to go back and see what it is that God would have us to do.
[time=1930] The beginning of the church which is recorded immediately after the experience on the day of Pentecost
[time=1937] in the second chapter of the book of Acts has all of the ingredients that we need to examine.
[time=1942] First of all as we look at this text we learn something about how the church began.
[time=1947] The church was started upon the foundation of the word of God.
[time=1952] Verse 41 of this chapter says that they gladly received his word.
[time=1957] The Bible tells us that in this particular situation Peter had preached a very forceful message
[time=1964] and the result of the preaching of that message was that God called together a group of men and women who responded to that message and a local church was formulated.
[time=1974] It is interesting to me that the foundation and the core of a growing, godly, great church is always the word of God.
[time=1982] It was back then, it has continued to be in every succeeding generation where God has blessed his church
[time=1988] and it will continue on into the future until Christ comes for his own that the word of God is the core of the church of God.
[time=1996] The scripture says that Peter preached and he preached faithfully verses 14 through 36 of this chapter record his sermon.
[time=2004] Verses 38 through 40 tell us a little bit about the power of that sermon.
[time=2008] The scripture says that when he finished and he gave his invitation he gave this altar call, he gave this appeal,
[time=2015] he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[time=2021] and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2025] And then we read that the people who heard his sermon, the people who heard his direction,
[time=2034] the people who listened to his message were so under conviction because of what he had to say that instead of Peter giving the invitation to them they gave the invitation to Peter.
[time=2045] For it says one verse ahead of that that when they recognized the impact of his message they said men and brethren what shall we do?
[time=2053] So powerful was the word of God in the hearts of those people that they were stirred to the very core of their being
[time=2059] and they were moved by the word of God to make a commitment to that which Peter was preaching.
[time=2066] Not only was it heard faithfully and preached faithfully but the scripture says it was received gladly and obeyed implicitly
[time=2074] on that day when that sermon was preached and the word of God was the foundation of the local church.
[time=2080] The scripture says that over 3000 people heard the word and committed their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2087] 3000 were added unto them. 3000 souls says verse 41.
[time=2093] The scripture says that not only did they hear the word and receive it gladly but having heard it and receiving it
[time=2100] they were baptized. That means they openly professed their faith.
[time=2104] They obediently followed what God said to them through his word, through his speaker, through his messenger Peter.
[time=2111] And the result was that the local church that was started here in this chapter and the second chapter of the book of Acts
[time=2119] got off to a flourishing start with 3000 converts and the record throughout the rest of the book of Acts
[time=2125] is one of the most phenomenal records of church growth you will ever read anywhere.
[time=2129] It started with the word of God.
[time=2132] And as we reflect upon where we are as a fellowship and as a church we must never lose our commitment
[time=2139] to that as the foundational truth of this church.
[time=2142] We are a church which is founded upon the word of God.
[time=2145] I hope that people who come here recognize that when they see that everybody brings a copy of the textbook with them.
[time=2152] We want people to know that the Black Hawk Baptist Church is God's word.
[time=2156] When we have problems we should go to the word of God for the answers.
[time=2160] When we don't know what to do we should go back to the Bible to find out what our answer should be.
[time=2164] As we sat around a table in a motel conference room this last week thinking about plans and procedures
[time=2170] we had our Bibles open looking at scriptures trying to find out what God would say to us about our planning and about our future.
[time=2177] And that's the way it ought to be.
[time=2179] The word of God was the foundation.
[time=2181] But notice on in the text that once they were in the church the church was organized in its very loose structure
[time=2187] certain things began to happen.
[time=2189] First of all the Bible says that they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine.
[time=2195] That means that they not only heard the word when they believed but after they came into the fellowship
[time=2201] they were indoctrinated with the truth of God's word.
[time=2204] It was the apostles doctrine that word which needed to be taught them so they would know how to live.
[time=2209] It was the word which was the light for their minds and it was the food for their hearts.
[time=2215] It was the word of God around which the whole structure of the church was formulated.
[time=2219] It was not just the impetus into the church.
[time=2222] It was the secret of the success and stability and growth of the church.
[time=2227] They were founded and taught upon the word of God.
[time=2231] May I say to you that there is no church life apart from the prominence given to the word of God.
[time=2237] We are not here to entertain.
[time=2239] We love our musicians when they come and they minister to our hearts.
[time=2242] We love all the special guests that come and we do many special wonderful things.
[time=2246] All of it focuses back to the fact that we are committed to the word of God and that is of primary importance.
[time=2252] The apostles doctrine.
[time=2254] I've often said that a local church was the best place in the world for a new convert and I still believe that.
[time=2260] I think sometimes we get people saved and then we just let them float out there until they find out somewhere down the road about 12 or 15 weeks that the church is supposed to be important.
[time=2269] But do you know something when you get a new convert under the sound of the word of God?
[time=2273] The first thing that happens is it begins to build around them a protective custody away from error.
[time=2280] You'd be surprised how many cults and isms there are out to get new believers.
[time=2285] You get them in a local church where the Bible is taught and one of the things that does is it safeguards them from error
[time=2291] and keeps them from getting caught up in doctrine that will destroy them.
[time=2295] The Bible says the first prong of their four point plan in the church was they continued in the apostles doctrine in a teaching ministry.
[time=2304] But then the word of God goes on to say that they continued in the apostles fellowship and the word fellowship is attached to the word apostles just as the word doctrine is attached to it.
[time=2314] The apostles fellowship.
[time=2316] It's interesting to me that God has been doing a work in our hearts about the necessity of fellowship within the body.
[time=2323] I think that's true because we have become quite numerous in the people who attend this church.
[time=2329] I know that some folks like to come to a big church because they can slip in and sit in the pew and leave.
[time=2334] Nobody knows they're there and they like the feeling of anonymity and being lost in a large group.
[time=2340] But that's not the way the Lord would have it.
[time=2342] I'm not interested in just collecting bodies to sit in pews on a Sunday so we can count them and say we had X number of people here.
[time=2349] The church is made up of people who need each other and the Bible says that in that early church they emphasized fellowship.
[time=2356] The apostles fellowship. Now let me say some things about fellowship.
[time=2360] Christianity is always first individual.
[time=2363] Our relationship with Christ is a personal relationship.
[time=2366] But as soon as that personal relationship is instigated in the person's life then it no longer is individual, it becomes social.
[time=2374] As soon as you come to Jesus Christ as your Savior personally then immediately you are thrust into a community
[time=2381] and you may not want to be there.
[time=2383] You may not feel comfortable there but that's the essence of Christianity is first individual.
[time=2387] It is secondly social.
[time=2389] First you are attached to Christ and then because you are attached to Him you automatically become attached to the rest of the body.
[time=2396] You may not like it.
[time=2397] You may look around and see nobody here that you really appreciate but the Scripture says you're a part of us.
[time=2402] Whether you like it or not you belong to us and we belong to you.
[time=2406] Fellowship is important.
[time=2408] The church is an organization.
[time=2410] If you come to our business office and see all of the paraphernalia that we use just to try to figure out what we're doing
[time=2416] you'd know we're an organization.
[time=2418] But men and women we are an organism first.
[time=2421] And an organism is something that is alive that breathes, that moves, that has spirit in it.
[time=2426] Organization is just the outward expression of an organism. It is just a means by which we try to make sure that we're all moving in the right direction.
[time=2434] And if we are an organism, if we are alive then that means the parts of the body must function together and they must be concerned about each other.
[time=2443] I've been interested in studying the New Testament to discover that the word saints is never found in the singular.
[time=2450] It is always in the plural. That says to me that God doesn't expect saints to walk around by themselves.
[time=2456] They need each other. They need to be with one another. They need to know about one another.
[time=2460] It is impossible to live the Christian life unattached.
[time=2464] And so in our church we're doing all we can to develop means and ways whereby people can get to know each other
[time=2470] with small groups and class parties and all the kinds of things that we do so that we can get to know each other and feel a part of the body.
[time=2478] The Holy Spirit in the New Testament is always involved in Christian society.
[time=2483] Now in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit selectively came upon people.
[time=2487] When you come to the New Testament the Holy Spirit seems to be indwelling individuals but his spiritual ministry is always found in the context of the local church as they're working together pursuing the goals of the church ministry.
[time=2501] I believe with all of my heart that in this church we need a re-emphasis on fellowship. I wish all of you could have been here last Sunday night.
[time=2509] I believe we had more noise after the service than we've had this morning with all these instruments playing full blast.
[time=2515] We had a time after we've preached on the importance of getting to know one another and reaching out and talking to one another and we said everybody loosed to find people they didn't know and get acquainted.
[time=2524] And I had one complaint from that whole procedure it was from the maintenance men who said it took so long to clear everybody out here and set them back about an hour in their program to set the building up.
[time=2534] That's good. It's something we need to be motivated to do because God wants us to be interested in one another.
[time=2540] He cares about our fellowship. Men and women we need to continue in the Apostles Fellowship.
[time=2546] We need to continue in the fellowship with one another. Did you ever discover how much of the New Testament is instruction on how to get along with each other?
[time=2555] Almost all of the epistles have large sections on the Christian graces, kindness, brotherly love, forbearance, tender heartiness, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2563] Did you ever try to put into those into operation without somebody else?
[time=2568] How are you going to be tender-hearted to somebody if there's nobody there?
[time=2572] How can you be loving if you don't have anybody to be loving to? How can you be gracious if you don't know anybody to be gracious to?
[time=2579] All that is assumed in the New Testament instruction to the church is that we are to relate to one another and we are to continue in fellowship.
[time=2588] Now, if the Apostles Doctrine is the safeguard for the new believer against error, then the Apostles Fellowship is the safeguard for the new believer against coldness, against feeling unloved, against feeling that nobody is doing what he's doing in Christianity but him.
[time=2607] And I just am so grateful for the way this body moves and breathes together and when somebody is born into the family, we just absorb them and make them feel so much apart.
[time=2616] Only a church can do that. I don't know anything else can do that. I don't know any other kind of organism that can so love a person like a local church that's doing what it ought to do, and it's the Apostles Fellowship that does that.
[time=2629] Now notice on in the text, he says that the third thing that ought to happen in the local church is that we not only ought to have fellowship, but there ought to be, according to this text, the breaking of bread.
[time=2641] That's the Lord's Supper. That's an integral part of what we do in our church.
[time=2647] I am amazed at how many Christians who've been in the faith for a long time seem to have such a little place of importance in their lives for communion.
[time=2658] Now we have communion in our church on Wednesday nights. That's done on purpose. Communion belongs to the Lord's people. Communion belongs to the family of God.
[time=2669] It doesn't belong to those who don't know Christ. It belongs to those who are Christians. We used to have communion on Sunday mornings, and we have many visitors who come from all different faiths and all different beliefs, and we love them, and they're a part of us, but they don't belong at communion. That's for God's people.
[time=2685] We have many visitors on Sunday night, and we can have it then and attach it to the end of the service, but we don't do that. We have it on Wednesday night when God's family meets, and they meet to interact with one another in a time of sharing and caring.
[time=2697] And then we come to the breaking of bread. I want to say to you folks who are members of this church, and I'm not really concerned who else is listening.
[time=2705] If you belong to this church and you belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, if I understand the Scripture right, it is a sin for you to miss communion.
[time=2713] The Bible commands God's people together together. You say, "Where does that say that?" You just look in 1 Corinthians 11.
[time=2721] It says as clearly as it can be said, "This do in remembrance of me."
[time=2729] Now, you know, if the Lord wanted to come down here and speak to us, I don't know how he could say it anymore plainly.
[time=2733] He didn't say, "When you get around to it, if you have time and you feel like coming, you come." If it's convenient for you to be at communion, then it's all right. The Bible says, "Do it. This do."
[time=2745] That's a matter of obedience. We have 900 members in our church.
[time=2750] You know something. We've never had 900 people at communion.
[time=2754] During Easter week, we had so many folks come that we ran out of communion glasses. That won't ever happen again.
[time=2761] But you know, if we were an obedient church, we'd have 900 people at communion every Wednesday.
[time=2766] It's a matter of obedience. It's a matter of remembrance. It says, "This do in remembrance of me." It's a matter of indicating that we belong to one another. In one of the instructions in the gospel, the Lord Jesus said,
[time=2778] "Drink ye all of it." In other words, all of you who are here who are in fellowship with one another, you drink it.
[time=2785] It's a part of your indication that you're in fellowship with one another.
[time=2789] Even the Lord's table tells us the importance of our interrelatedness in this church. Drink ye all of it.
[time=2796] And it is a foreshadowing of the future when we will sit down with the Lord Jesus Christ at that marriage supper of the Lamb
[time=2803] and enjoy His personal fellowship. And that's why it says, "In the instruction concerning communion, this do till I come."
[time=2811] The breaking of bread. Do you know, if I understand the New Testament right people, being at communion service
[time=2818] and fellowshipping with God around the Lord's table is just as important in the fourfold plan of the church as the other things.
[time=2825] All part of the same. God expects us to be there.
[time=2832] Now, if the apostle's doctrine is a safeguard for new believers so that they won't get into air,
[time=2839] and the apostle's fellowship is a safeguard for new believers so that they won't feel cold and unloved,
[time=2846] then the breaking of bread and communion is a safeguard for all of us that we not become superficial
[time=2853] and piously, saintly, without being real. Because you see, all that is a part of the communion is that we are to examine ourselves.
[time=2863] One of the best safeguards I know to keep you on the right track, going in the right direction in this local church is for you to be at communion,
[time=2869] examining your heart before God. That's why the Bible tells us we're to do it. We're to be together with God's folks
[time=2876] and regularly examine where we are in relationship to Him. And that keeps us on track.
[time=2882] Then will you notice that it also says we're to continue in the apostle's doctrine and in the apostle's fellowship
[time=2889] and in the breaking of breads and finally in prayers.
[time=2894] This word "prayers" implies public and stated prayers. It implies that when we come together, we pray.
[time=2901] We interact with God. We commune with Him publicly. It is the word which is used for the kind of praying that the Jews did
[time=2910] when they were in the temple. It is a public saying to God, "We need you."
[time=2917] Now if the apostle's doctrine is the safeguard against air and the apostle's fellowship is the safeguard against coldness
[time=2926] and the breaking of bread is the safeguard against superfluous Christianity,
[time=2934] then prayers is the safeguard against independence. The independent spirit that says we did this.
[time=2941] We put this church together. We caused this church to grow. No, we didn't. God did it.
[time=2947] And every time we come together to pray, we say, "Lord, we need you. We can't do it ourselves. We need your help.
[time=2955] You've got to do the work in this church." So you see within the church are all the things we need to safeguard us
[time=2961] and keep us where we ought to be. And that's why God put it together that way.
[time=2965] That's why any time we get away from that, we start doing other things that detract from that.
[time=2970] We have headed in a direction that will ultimately have a tremendously bad effect on each of us individually and on our church as a whole.
[time=2977] You say, "Pastor Dave, what happened in that early church?" Well, the church grew. I mean it just flourished.
[time=2986] You say, "You mean it flourished because they just did four things?" That's right. Four basic things to the church.
[time=2992] Everything we do here needs to find its place in those four basic pillars of the church and be thought of in relationship to those things.
[time=3000] One of the problems we face in a growing church and with many ministries stretching out in many different directions
[time=3006] is that if we're not careful, we get so complicated in the way we think about it that we can't figure out what's going on.
[time=3013] One of the great motivators of our country is a fellow by the name of Charlie Jones.
[time=3018] He has a little statement that he has that he passes out wherever he goes and it goes like this, "Sibkiss."
[time=3025] I never heard of that word before. I didn't know what that meant. And then I read his book and I found out what "Sibkiss" meant.
[time=3031] It means see it big, but keep it simple. That's what we've got to do and you know God's already done that for us.
[time=3039] He's put it down here in terms so simple. If we just see it in those simple terms, we don't have to get blown out because of what God is doing.
[time=3046] Do you know what? You can still preach the word even though there's 2,000 people instead of 20.
[time=3050] You can still fellowship even though there's 2,500 people instead of 75.
[time=3055] You can still break bread if you come. Just like you did back in the beginning.
[time=3062] And you can pray, "My goodness, can you pray?" With all of God's people gathered, you can pray like you never prayed before.
[time=3068] That's just as simple as it can be. And I just have in my heart a deep commitment that if we stay where that is,
[time=3074] in the simple plan and program of the church, God will just keep right on blessing us as He has in the past because we stay on target.
[time=3081] In this early church, the Bible says in verse 44 that one of the results of this was that they were unified.
[time=3088] They had unity, all things in common. They had a common faith, a common belief and common goods.
[time=3094] Verse 45 says they were unselfish. They reached out to one another to help one another in a time of need.
[time=3100] The Bible tells us that in all that they did, they progressed and God blessed them.
[time=3106] Verse 47 says that the result of that church simplifying their program, doing what God called them to do was that they were praising God.
[time=3115] They were having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
[time=3123] Isn't that what we want? Isn't that our goal? You say, Pastor Jeremiah, what do you want to see happen in this church in these next years as we look toward the promised land?
[time=3132] I don't have any problem. That's pretty simple. I want everybody to have a grateful spirit be praising God.
[time=3138] There's something health giving about that when we come together and sing and when we clap our hands and are joyful in our hearts because we've been blessed in our spirit.
[time=3146] When there's corporal gratitude and individual gratitude, that's something that's health giving and it keeps us right in our spirit, says they were praising God.
[time=3154] We've had some of the greatest praise services in this church.
[time=3157] I believe the last Wednesday night praise service when we gathered around the Lord's table may have been one of the mountaintop experiences in this church.
[time=3165] We were just praising God. And then it says they were not only praising God, but they were having favor with all the people.
[time=3173] That doesn't mean just the people in the church. That means everywhere. Everywhere folks went in that early day, they would say, you ought to see what's happened down at 1st Baptist in Jerusalem.
[time=3181] Why those people down there, they're just going crazy.
[time=3185] Well, you can let me have a little liberty with that, can't you?
[time=3191] Those people down there, they love each other. Why, you can't keep them apart. Every time they have a chance they get together, they're always eating.
[time=3200] Well, it does say that here. I found it. Let me see if I can find it again.
[time=3204] It says that in verse 46, it says they did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart and that doesn't talk about communion.
[time=3211] That means they got together and shared fellowship dinners.
[time=3214] Boy, we're sure being obedient to that, aren't we, Ken? Almost every day.
[time=3220] They had gratitude with one another and they shared with one another and they loved one another and God caused them to be united with one another.
[time=3229] And then it says, and this is part I like, and the Lord added how often daily to the church.
[time=3237] We add weekly and monthly and yearly. Wouldn't it be great if we had to call a special group together and say, folks, we've just got to have baptismal service tomorrow night.
[time=3248] If we don't, we'll be so far behind. We'll never catch up.
[time=3251] So if you come on down, we're going to have a special service so we can keep up with all those who are coming to Christ and daily people be added to the church.
[time=3258] It's our goal that we can move from the monthly additions to the weekly additions.
[time=3262] And then who knows? God can cause us to move to the daily additions.
[time=3267] Last night, all of us who were part of this team stood up in a tall building where there's a restaurant and windows around the outside.
[time=3275] All of the deacons and their wives and all of the staff and their wives.
[time=3279] And we stood around that building looking out the windows all around the corner of that building and we had a prayer meeting.
[time=3285] I don't think I'll forget that for a long time as we looked out at the lights all over Fort Wayne and we saw all the people that needed to be added to God's family.
[time=3294] And we prayed and said, oh, God, help us not to lose the vision you've given us to reach our city for Jesus Christ.
[time=3301] There's a thousand plus here today, but there are 400,000 people all around us, many of whom don't know Jesus.
[time=3309] And God's let us be a part of His plan to reach out and get them and then make them a part of us and together build a work that will glorify Him.
[time=3318] Shall we pray?
[time=3321] Father, we're so grateful for Your plan and it is simple, not profound, right down where we can get a hold of it, help us to do what we ought to do, to stay on target.
[time=3336] Oh, God, don't let us get off in some extraneous things that are going to pull us apart from that which you have for us.
[time=3343] So easy to do that.
[time=3345] Someone everywhere wants you to do something that they're doing.
[time=3348] But Lord, we just want to stay on target to do the simple things you've called us to do.
[time=3353] And we know that when we do, you'll bless it.
[time=3356] God will be honored.
[time=3357] People will be saved.
[time=3358] The fellowship will grow and will have an impact on our society, unlike anything man has ever known.
[time=3365] Father, here today in this auditorium are some who have yet to be added to Your family.
[time=3371] And I'm not just talking, Father, about our own little local church.
[time=3374] I'm talking about the family of God.
[time=3376] Some who have yet to accept Christ as their Savior.
[time=3379] They've heard the Word.
[time=3380] They know what they ought to do, but they've never prayed in a personal prayer to invite Christ into their life.
[time=3387] What a tremendous opportunity it would be for them today.
[time=3391] As they did back in the first day of the church, having heard the Word to respond, we pray for them.
[time=3400] We ask that you will minister to their lives today and cause them, Lord, to be responsive.
[time=3405] Then there are some who are Christians who've never been obedient by publicly letting others know that they're Christians.
[time=3413] Maybe they need to be baptized, but first of all, Father, they need to come.
