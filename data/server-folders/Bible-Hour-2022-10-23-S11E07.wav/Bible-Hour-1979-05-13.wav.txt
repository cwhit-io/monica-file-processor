[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=30] In Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jaramah.
[time=36] I sing God's name, I bring now all, I bring now all, and since my soul, I sing God's name, I bring now all.
[time=61] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=78] This is Mother's Day, 1979 at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and we're honoring our mothers
[time=84] today in our services.
[time=87] We're so grateful that we can do that in keeping with the tenor of the Word of God.
[time=92] I used to have a friend whose favorite word was "super." Everything to him was super.
[time=101] Even things that weren't so super were super.
[time=105] He was in step with our times because it seems to be a word that is in much use these days.
[time=111] We have super bowls and super burgers and a superman and a lot of other things to which
[time=119] we attach the prefix "super." Today I want to speak on the subject "supermom" and I'm sure if you're seated next to your
[time=128] mother in the service today, you probably think I'm going to be talking about her.
[time=135] Stay with us as we share together the music of the Christian faith and then the message of the Word of God.
[time=141] Our choir under the direction of Pastor Kruger is singing for us now how wonderful thou art.
[time=171] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=333] There is one thing that a church choir can do that no other instrumental or musical group
[time=344] can ever hope to duplicate and that is to sing the majestic anthems of the church and
[time=351] how we rejoice with the words and music of our choir.
[time=355] We believe that, that we have a wonderful Lord who cares for our needs in a beautiful wonderful way and we have been praising Him in our hearts as we have listened to the music this morning.
[time=367] Stephen Maria Gardner have become very good friends with all of us here.
[time=371] We love them and appreciate them so much.
[time=374] They have paid a supreme sacrifice to be with us this weekend.
[time=378] We have had the privilege of having them as our guest this weekend not only for the services today but they were the guest musicians at the mother and daughter banquet yesterday.
[time=388] Normally they fly their little plane from Dallas, Texas to their engagements but the
[time=394] weather was so bad they couldn't get clearance to fly and you know what's happening with the airlines they couldn't get an airline flight in commercially and so they drove.
[time=405] All the way from Dallas if they look like they're still moving while they're singing it's because they've been in the car for so long but the Lord protected them over the highway and brought them to us safely they were a blessing to the ladies yesterday and I'm sure they'll be a blessing to us now.
[time=447] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[time=499] He has done great things, he has done great things, he has done great things, bless his
[time=526] holy name, sing with us, will you bless the Lord, oh my soul, bless the Lord, oh my
[time=536] soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[time=552] He has done great things, he has done great things, he has done great things.
[time=565] Bless his holy name, bless his holy name, he has done great things, bless his holy
[time=579] for thine is the kingdom, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for
[time=592] [MUSIC]
[time=623] - We're grateful for the opportunity of sharing the Bible hour with you and your home.
[time=627] And for this special opportunity when we can sit down and talk with you just like we were in your living room and chat with you on a more informal basis about some things that are well pertinent to your lives in two hours.
[time=639] As you know, this is a special day, and though some of you received this telecast two weeks delayed, we still think it's important that we emphasize the virtue of motherhood on this mother's day and to talk about the importance of being a godly woman.
[time=654] And I'm going to be doing that in my message in just a few moments.
[time=657] But this is not just a theological issue.
[time=659] This is a personal issue that comes right down to where we live.
[time=662] - It sure does.
[time=663] And my day really started out early this morning.
[time=666] I awoke and my oldest daughter, Jan, was standing by the bed with a breakfast tray.
[time=671] And then my son came in with a gift that he'd made in school and it's been a super day already.
[time=677] - Well, I suppose that when we look back over the years and think about mother's days, we won't remember probably even the sermons, but we'll remember some of the things that happen in our homes that reflect the love of children.
[time=690] And that's one of the exciting things about being parents.
[time=693] Donna, we have been talking for so long about a special gift offer that if you were here in the Convocation Center as we're ready to tape this little section together and heard some of the discussion we had about it, you'd understand that we're trying to think of a new way to share with you the importance of a very exciting little study tool.
[time=713] But after we joke about it and have some fun talking about the 900th time that we're talking about the Four Gospels as a single narrative, we do want to get past all of that and get down to the detail of discussing with you a very special book, a very special study book that you can use in your own home in studying the scripture.
[time=732] - And I think that it obviously is a good tool because we've had so many requests for it.
[time=738] And it's the Four Gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=741] And in the back of the book is an index so that if you're studying a particular subject, you can look back there and find out what page it's on and turn right to it.
[time=751] And all Four Gospel accounts of it are in one place.
[time=754] - Many people have written for their copy of the Four Gospels.
[time=758] In fact, as I talked with our director just a few moments ago, he said we'd mailed out more of those than almost any other gift that we've ever given to people who've written.
[time=767] But you know, I thought this morning that there are probably numbers who haven't yet requested it.
[time=773] And I'm certain that that's true because when we look at the number of books we've sent out and we know how many people watch this telecast, there are still hundreds and thousands of people who have yet to write.
[time=783] And it's a free book.
[time=784] It's not with any strings attached or conditions imposed upon it, but it's our way of saying thank you for being a part of the Bible hour and of extending the ministry of the Bible hour into your home.
[time=795] One of the things we decided a long time ago down is that we don't want to give things away that are just trinkets or things that people can wear necessarily without any relationship to the Word of God.
[time=808] - That's right.
[time=809] We want to put something into your hands that's gonna be useful as you mature as a Christian.
[time=814] - And that's why we're so excited about the Four Gospels as a single narrative.
[time=818] It's really a restructuring of the actual texts of the New Testament Gospels.
[time=825] Not any words are changed, but they've just put the paragraphs in order so that as you start at the beginning you can read all the way through the Lord Jesus Christ's life from his pre-incarnation all the way to his resurrection and ascension and it is simply a tool to use in studying the Word of God.
[time=841] We believe that the Word of God makes the difference and so every way we can emphasize that both in the program and in the materials that we send out, that's what we're gonna do.
[time=850] And we'd like to have the privilege of sending this free book into your home this week if you will let us know by simply writing to us.
[time=858] Why don't you tell them how to get in touch with us?
[time=860] - Just right to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=871] That post office box again is post office box 15250 Fort Wayne.
[time=876] - Thank you, Donna.
[time=878] Just a few moments we're gonna have some more music from Stephen Maria and then I'm gonna be opening the Word of God to the 31st chapter of Proverbs and I'm speaking today on the subject, Supermom.
[time=889] I hope you'll stay with us and join with us in the Word of God as we study together these wonderful truths from the scripture that are so very, very true for today.
[time=898] Once again, before we go back to the service, let me remind you that if you're writing to us this week, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=909] If when you write, you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television, we appreciate it, but we want you to know that the book is absolutely free and if you can't send a gift, please request the book anyway and we'll be happy to send it to you.
[time=921] Now, stay with us as we go back to our morning service.
[time=923] (soft music)
[time=971] (soft music) Let's take our hymnals, let's take our hymnals now
[time=984] and turn in them to hymn number 358 and we'll sing the grand old gospel song, "Hallelujah 'tis done," hymn number 358.
[time=998] We'll remain seated as we sing.
[time=1001] (soft music)
[time=1028] (soft music) And the second is the last.
[time=1045] (soft music)
[time=1058] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=1087] And thank you for that good singing.
[time=1089] Only the real believer is the one who can sing the highest word in any language of praise to God, hallelujah, and then it's finished with the word 'tis done.
[time=1102] Christ finished the transaction on the cross and we can sing hallelujah.
[time=1106] I enjoy that song very much.
[time=1108] Now we're going to listen to our male duet as they come and sing the song, "Bring Back the Springtime."
[time=1115] [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=1321] - Thank you Ron and Dennis.
[time=1332] I would like to ask all of the mothers who are present with us today if you would to please stand right now everywhere all over the building.
[time=1340] If you would just stand please.
[time=1342] We want to honor you and I want to ask you to stay standing until the children have a chance to give you something.
[time=1350] All of the children of the church are waiting just to give all of our mothers something special and you stay standing until you get yours, all right?
[time=1360] This is a very special day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and as soon as you receive your gift you can sit down and then they'll know who they have to give one to yet.
[time=1368] Now this may take a few minutes.
[time=1370] (audience laughing) Do you know that was gonna happen?
[time=1378] And Stephen Maria are up here rejoicing.
[time=1382] She got her little gift from Mandy too.
[time=1384] We're going to ask the children to hurry as quickly as possible to give these to the ladies and while you're receiving your plants ladies I'm gonna ask Maria to come and sing so we can take advantage of the opportunity to have some music.
[time=1402] We want to make sure everyone has a chance to get their gift on Mother's Day.
[time=1407] Maria is going to sing for us now and you kind of listen and enjoy.
[time=1413] She's gonna sing a song entitled "Hiding in the." (orchestral music)
[time=1431] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=1515] (orchestral music) [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=1623] - Thank you, Maria.
[time=1626] And the children did that wonderfully, didn't they?
[time=1629] We're so, we didn't have much time to prepare them, but they did it just right.
[time=1635] Ladies, if you don't know what to do with that beautiful plant, there's a good place right under your chair where you can put it and then you'll be able to open your Bibles and study along with us and you won't have to hold it during the whole hour.
[time=1645] That would be a little bit cumbersome.
[time=1647] I ask you to join me now in the Word of God as we open to the 31st chapter of the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament, Proverbs chapter 31.
[time=1662] And my subject for this hour is super mom.
[time=1668] Proverbs chapter 31, and I'm reading from the 31st chapter of Proverbs beginning at the 10th verse.
[time=1676] Proverbs chapter 31, beginning my reading at the 10th verse.
[time=1680] Who can find a virtuous woman for her prices far above rubies?
[time=1685] The heart of her husband, a safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[time=1690] She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
[time=1694] She seeketh woolen flax and worketh willingly with her hands.
[time=1698] She is like the merchant's ships.
[time=1700] She bringeth her food from afar.
[time=1703] She riseeth also while it is yet night and giveeth food to her household and a portion to her maidens.
[time=1709] She considereth a field and biofit with the fruit of her hand she planted the vineyard.
[time=1715] She girdeth her loins with strength and strengthened with her arms.
[time=1718] She perceiveeth at her merchandise is good.
[time=1721] Her lamp goeth not out by night.
[time=1723] She layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff.
[time=1727] She stretcheth out her hand to the poor.
[time=1729] Yay, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
[time=1733] She is not afraid of the snow for her household.
[time=1736] For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
[time=1739] She makeeth herself coverings of tapestry.
[time=1741] Her clothing is silk and purple.
[time=1744] Her husband is known in the gates when he siteth among the elders of the land.
[time=1748] She makeeth fine linen and celithid and deliverth girdles unto the merchant.
[time=1752] Strengthen honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come.
[time=1756] She openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
[time=1761] She looketh well to the ways of her husband and Edith not the bread of idleness.
[time=1766] Her children rise up and call her blessed.
[time=1768] Her husband also and he prayseth her.
[time=1771] Many daughters have done virtuously but thou excelest them all.
[time=1775] Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who feareth the Lord shall be praised.
[time=1782] Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates.
[time=1786] Shall we pray together?
[time=1788] Lord, what truth for this day is found in these few verses.
[time=1792] Help us to be able to clearly teach it and to apply it to the hearts of all of those who listen and may it be a challenge to all of the mothers who hear this message to all of us father, as many of these principles reach beyond just motherhood to touch the lives of every one of us here today.
[time=1811] We thank you in Jesus' name for what you're going to do in Christ's name, I pray, amen.
[time=1817] When I announce a subject such as Super Mom, I might be tempted to talk about my own mother for I do believe I was blessed indeed with a God-fearing mother who spent many hours of sacrificial love getting us out of the nest and on the right path in the right direction.
[time=1838] I might speak about my own wife or I have had a wonderful opportunity of watching her as she has mother to our children and I think she's a super mother too.
[time=1848] But I've chosen rather to take some words from the scripture that give to us a portrait of Super Mom from the viewpoint of the inspired writing.
[time=1858] This portrait of Super Mom is taken from the 31st chapter of Proverbs, verses 10 through 31.
[time=1865] Here you will find 22 verses of scripture.
[time=1868] If we had the Old Testament Hebrew in front of us, you would see that this has been carefully put into an acrostic, each of the verses starting with a succeeding letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
[time=1880] It would be like some of the cards you receive, that special times in the year.
[time=1885] You would almost see the letter of the alphabet larger than the rest of the type, elucidating the truths of each verse.
[time=1892] These 22 verses share with us some of the characteristics of a woman who is godly, who sets the standard and the pattern for women everywhere to follow.
[time=1904] These verses paint a picture, as I'm sure you can see by just hearing it read or perhaps having read it before, of a woman who is not just your average homemaker of today.
[time=1915] She was obviously a woman of some means, a woman who had more than just the ordinary concerns.
[time=1921] The scripture records that she managed servants, that she had money to invest, that she was in partnership with her husband in investing.
[time=1930] She was both a buyer and a seller.
[time=1933] She was a tireless worker.
[time=1935] She reached out to help the poor, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1939] As a representative of all women, here is a woman who fills the borders of every woman's life.
[time=1945] Some of you might say, well, yes, but all of these characteristics which are extolled in this passage of scripture are well and good for Bible people, but Pastor Jeremiah, you don't understand the kind of life that I live.
[time=1959] You don't understand what it's like to be a mother today.
[time=1962] May I say to you that this passage of scripture reaches beyond the boundaries of any mother that I'm ever aware of in our culture today and touches on areas of life that would stretch any of the mothers of today's world to the very limit.
[time=1975] It is a representative passage that is a goal for which to shoot.
[time=1979] It is a standard which we should set our sights upon as it relates to motherhood.
[time=1986] I doubt if there is a gal listening to me today to whom this passage will not have some meaning if you have begun to understand the meaning of motherhood.
[time=1995] Now, the passage lifts up some characteristics of this godly woman.
[time=2001] And I want to share these characteristics with you.
[time=2003] First of all, what makes a supermom?
[time=2007] Well, a supermom is first of all a woman who is faithful.
[time=2011] Her fidelity is extolled in verses 11 and 12.
[time=2014] It says here that the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil, she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
[time=2027] The heart of her husband, says the scripture, is at rest in her love and her unselfish affection.
[time=2034] The purity of her inner life and the radiance of her personality bring credit to her husband.
[time=2042] Now, what does the scripture mean when it says she is faithful, that she is one in whom the heart of her husband can trust?
[time=2049] If you are a student of the book of Proverbs, you will know that as perhaps no other book in all of the Bible, the book of Proverbs warns against immorality in the lives of both husbands and wives.
[time=2060] There are special passages throughout the book that deal with immoral women, with women who are not faithful to their husbands.
[time=2068] In order to see this instruction in its proper setting, it would be necessary for us to go back into the book of Proverbs just a few pages to the seventh chapter.
[time=2078] And let me read to you a scenario from the book of Proverbs that describes the opposite of a faithful woman.
[time=2085] Proverbs chapter seven and verse six could be any kind of meaningful scenario in today's world, for it sounds very similar to what happens every day in the world in which you and I live.
[time=2098] Verse six says, "At the window of my house, I look through my casement and behold among the simple ones, I discerned among the use a young man void of understanding, passing through the street near her corner, and he went the way to her house.
[time=2111] In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night, and behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtle of heart.
[time=2118] She is loud and stubborn.
[time=2119] Her feet abide not in her house.
[time=2121] Now she is outside, now in the streets, and lieth and waited every corner.
[time=2125] So she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face, she said unto him, I have peace offerings with me.
[time=2131] This day have I paid my vows.
[time=2133] Therefore came I forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
[time=2138] I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with embroidered works with fine linen of Egypt.
[time=2143] I have perfumed my bed with mare, aloes, and cinnamon.
[time=2147] Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning.
[time=2150] Let us soulless ourselves with love.
[time=2152] Notice, for my husband is not at home.
[time=2156] He has gone on a long journey.
[time=2159] There was a day, as I was growing up, when I thought that all infidelity and immorality basically related to wayward men.
[time=2169] But I am discovering that there are just about as many predatory women alive today as there are men, and that the Bible clearly warns against that, and we ought to take notice of the fact that one of the characteristics of a godly woman is that she is faithful.
[time=2184] You say, Pastor, you ought not to have to say that in a church.
[time=2187] Let me say to you that it is at the point in time where I read the statistic pages of our city on occasion, wondering who is the next one, who is going to fall into the disarray of a home.
[time=2199] The Bible says that fundamental to the operation of a home, and one of the primary characteristics of a godly woman is that she is faithful to her husband.
[time=2209] She is faithful in word and in deed.
[time=2213] And the scripture says she does him good all the days of his life.
[time=2217] That means that from the very beginning to the very end of the marriage relationship, she is a woman whose life is characterized by fidelity.
[time=2226] I heard a nationally syndicated religious television program this week on which a psychologist spoke.
[time=2233] And the psychologist said that in the hundreds of hours of counseling that he had done over these past 10 years, he had never met a woman who had been unfaithful to her husband who was not an avid watcher of the soap operas every day.
[time=2252] And he went on to say that the soap operas simply implant into the hearts of women today that that's the way you live, that's the style, that's the way everybody's doing it.
[time=2263] High society people, doctors and lawyers and wealthy people, the way you live is in immorality and in infidelity.
[time=2269] And so they watch that and they see it and a problem comes up in their home and pretty soon they say, well, that's just the way everybody does it today.
[time=2275] And so they do it.
[time=2276] I have some more to say about that later.
[time=2281] Her fidelity.
[time=2283] Secondly, I want you to notice her industry.
[time=2285] Verses 13 through 19 extol the virtues of her industry.
[time=2291] I wish I had time today to solve for you the question of whether or not women should work outside of the home.
[time=2297] You cannot miss the fact that here was a woman whose industry reached further than just the regular normal homemakers chores.
[time=2305] She was a woman whose industry worked out of her home.
[time=2308] She was a seller of goods.
[time=2310] She was a creator of industry.
[time=2312] She was a buyer, a merchandiser.
[time=2314] It seems as if she worked out of her home.
[time=2316] It was a part of her partnership with her husband.
[time=2318] I heard a fellow the other day who said that he believed that woman's place was in the home too and that she should go straight there from work every day.
[time=2328] (audience laughing) I don't believe that you can prove one way or the other
[time=2337] from the scripture that a woman ought not to work, but I do know this that according to the scripture, her priority is her home.
[time=2343] By a time today to read some quotations that I've prepared for this message, I think I could help you understand that a woman works outside of the home by necessity, but it is not the normal, natural right thing for her to do if she has little ones growing up in the nest that need her nurture and admonition.
[time=2359] I frankly am not excited about letting somebody else rear my children.
[time=2366] I want my wife and myself to have that opportunity.
[time=2369] Now the scripture does say, however, that there are some things in this woman's life in Proverbs 31 about her industry and I just have to touch on them quickly.
[time=2378] Notice verse 13, it tells us that she worked willingly.
[time=2382] This related not only to her chores at home, but all of the things that she did.
[time=2386] She was a willing worker.
[time=2387] Verse 13 says she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.
[time=2392] Verse 14 tells us she worked joyfully.
[time=2395] She is like the merchant's ships.
[time=2397] She bringeth her food from afar.
[time=2399] This phrase or this idiom from the Old Testament scripture is to be understood in the following way.
[time=2405] Like the merchant ships returning from afar with their wares, there is an element of glad surprise in this woman's service.
[time=2412] She does it joyfully, she does it willingly.
[time=2415] And then it says she works sacrificially.
[time=2417] She rises also while it is yet night and give a food to her household.
[time=2422] She is a woman who is not afraid to sacrifice sleep in behalf of those that she loves.
[time=2426] She rises up while it is yet night to prepare food for the day.
[time=2430] This oriental culture was a culture which demanded that a woman get up great while before dawn to prepare food for her husband because he had to get to work before the sun came up in order that he might get out of the sultry heat during the middle of the day.
[time=2446] And so his wife would get up early in the morning to prepare his food.
[time=2450] She worked sacrificially.
[time=2452] Verses 16 through 19 tell us that she worked prudently.
[time=2456] She diligently spent the household money.
[time=2458] Verses 16 says she considered a field.
[time=2462] And with the fruit of her hand, she plants a vineyard.
[time=2466] She considered and then she bought.
[time=2468] She didn't waste the household money but she was a prudent manager of the household finances.
[time=2473] Verse 27 tells us that she did not eat the bread of idleness.
[time=2478] She was a woman who was industrious, who worked and was careful to be about the task that were hers.
[time=2484] If she were alive today, she would not be a woman who had time to be sitting around in the living room listening to as the stomach turns, or the misguided light, or the young, the restless, and the immoral,
[time=2501] which is what they ought to be called.
[time=2503] She would be about the business of being a wife and the mother she would be involved, not eating the bread of laziness.
[time=2512] Her fidelity and her industry.
[time=2516] She was an industrious woman, super mom.
[time=2519] One of the great memories I have of my mother.
[time=2522] One of the things that I'll never forget is when my father became the president of Cedarville College.
[time=2527] In the school was small, we just had a few staff people.
[time=2531] My mother was an immaculate housekeeper and yet somehow she would find time every day to get the house in order and get things ready and she would go to the school and go down into a basement room that used to be a coal ban of some sort and run a 1250 Malta lift putting printing out for the school and her hands were full of ink and not the necessarily the normal way that she liked to look at a woman's hands but she was a hard working industrious person.
[time=2559] You know, it's easy for a man to be a slugger but it's just as easy for a woman to be a slugger and to be lazy.
[time=2565] God's definition of super mom is that she was an industrious person.
[time=2570] She was faithful and she was industrious.
[time=2573] Now, no less thirdly, I want you to notice her ministry.
[time=2577] Verses 20 to 23 are precious words about women and about mothers and what they do by way of ministry.
[time=2583] I want you to notice four words in the text that will help you to keep the ministry in the way the scripture teaches it.
[time=2590] In verse 20, underline the word hands.
[time=2593] In verse 21, underline the word household.
[time=2600] And in verse 23, underline the word husband.
[time=2603] All right, now the scripture says her ministry was fourfold.
[time=2608] First of all, she stretches forth her hands to the poor and needy.
[time=2617] She was not a self-centered person.
[time=2618] This woman was not someone who just centered all of her attention upon herself and her own, but she reached out to those around.
[time=2626] She would be the kind of gal who would knock on your door when you move in and bring you a cake that she baked because she knew you were under pressure with the moving days and she would reach out to you because she knew there was a need.
[time=2638] I couldn't help but notice the reoccurrence in this passage of scripture of the word hands.
[time=2642] Will you just take a brief survey with me back through the scripture that we have read already this morning?
[time=2648] Notice in verse 13, she works willingly with her hands.
[time=2652] Verse 16, with the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.
[time=2656] Verse 19, she layeth her hands to the spindle.
[time=2659] Verse 20, she holds the distaff with her hands.
[time=2664] Verse 20, she stretches out her hands to the poor.
[time=2668] She reaches forth her hands to the needy.
[time=2670] She is involved in ministering and you see in that picture the ministering hands of a godly mother who uses her hands to care for her own and to care for the needs of others.
[time=2681] Let me just remind you that there's one more use of hands in this passage of scripture and that's in verse 31.
[time=2686] And this tells us that she will someday eat of the fruit of her hands.
[time=2691] Her hands ministering to others will cause others to minister to her.
[time=2695] She is a woman who ministers first of all outside of her own home to others who are needy and others who have difficulty to the poor and needy.
[time=2703] But notice secondly, she not only stretches out her hands but she prepares ahead for her household.
[time=2710] Once again in this text, the word household is mentioned a number of times.
[time=2714] Verse 15, we're told she gives food to her household.
[time=2717] Verse 21, we're told she fears not snow for her household.
[time=2722] Verse 21, she clothes her household.
[time=2724] Verse 27, she looks well to the ways of her household.
[time=2729] This passage of scripture says that this woman because of her commitment to ministry make sure that the needs of her household are met and she doesn't wait until the arise.
[time=2738] She prepares ahead of time.
[time=2740] She looks to the future to what their needs might be and she begins to prepare for those needs.
[time=2746] Her hands and her household, notice thirdly, she doesn't forget about herself.
[time=2751] Ladies, one of the greatest ministries you can have is a ministry to yourself.
[time=2757] Verse 22 says she make of herself coverings of tapestry.
[time=2761] Her clothing is silk and purple.
[time=2766] Thomas Wolfe has said that there is not a spectacle on earth more appealing than that of a beautiful woman in the act of cooking dinner for someone she loves.
[time=2779] This puts the two of those things together.
[time=2781] She cares for her household, but she cares for herself.
[time=2785] She keeps herself up.
[time=2787] My father-in-law just completed a visit here and he is a man of many stories.
[time=2794] And every time he comes, we hear all of the stories he's collected over the months.
[time=2798] And while he was here, he was telling us about a fellow from down south who came up to visit some relatives.
[time=2804] This old boy had been so far back in the woods he'd never seen a mirror in his life.
[time=2809] And when he got up to the relatives, somebody gave him a little round mirror and he held it out and looked at it and he said, "Why goodness, that's my old grandpappy.
[time=2815] "If I ever saw you in my life, that's my grandpappy." And he was just so enamored by that thing.
[time=2820] He took the mirror up and put it in the attic, stored it, one day his wife was up there.
[time=2825] She was digging around in the relics up in the attic and she found it and she looked at it and she said, "Well, that's the old hag he's been running around with." (audience laughing) You know, gals, it doesn't hurt to have a ministry
[time=2842] to yourselves, does it?
[time=2843] It doesn't hurt to have a ministry to yourselves.
[time=2848] She kept herself up.
[time=2850] She reached out to others.
[time=2854] She ministered to her household and she ministered to herself.
[time=2857] Now notice fourthly, she had a ministry to her husband.
[time=2860] This excites me.
[time=2861] Her husband is known in the gates when he sit at the among the elders of the land.
[time=2864] What does that mean?
[time=2865] He is known there because of her.
[time=2868] Because of what she does, because of her ministry, because of the kind of woman she is.
[time=2873] The scripture says her husband is looked up to and respected because of the kind of wife that he has.
[time=2879] And because of the way that she lifts him up and ministers to him and cares for him, the greatest compliment a man can ever have is for someone to compliment his wife.
[time=2892] You have a godly wife.
[time=2893] You have a wife who understands what the Bible means when it talks about being a godly wife.
[time=2900] That's a high and holy compliment.
[time=2902] I have seen men lifted up by their wives.
[time=2905] I have seen men drug down by their wives.
[time=2910] Her ministry was a ministry with her hands outstretched.
[time=2915] Her ministry was dressing up her household for the future.
[time=2919] Her ministry was keeping up herself and her ministry was lifting up her husband.
[time=2925] We have talked about supermom and we have talked about her busy life and her busy schedule and her industry.
[time=2933] I have to believe that Geraldine Everett Cohn must have been contemplating the active life of a supermom when she wrote the following lines in one of her books of poetry.
[time=2943] She wrote, "I wished for home and husband.
[time=2947] "The wish was given me.
[time=2949] "My heart and heart are daily sparked with masculinity.
[time=2953] "I wished for children.
[time=2956] "This request was also granted me "a nimble five-ring circus performing endlessly.
[time=2963] "I'm ready for my third wish now "though squandered it may be.
[time=2969] "A few dull moments please, oh please, just occasionally." (audience laughing) Women, you know what that's all about, don't you?
[time=2978] She was an industrious ministering woman.
[time=2982] I want you to notice fourthly her integrity.
[time=2985] Verses 24 through 26 and I touch upon it lightly.
[time=2989] It says she makes fine linen and sell of it, deliver with girdles unto the merchants, strengthen honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come.
[time=2998] She opened with her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
[time=3003] May I point out to you that these verses extol the virtue of ministering now with reward in the future?
[time=3012] One of the hard things I'm certain about being a mother is the fact that you have to work so hard, so diligently without any obvious reward.
[time=3022] You minister, you cook, you reach out, you take care of the clothes, you take care of the discipline of the home so many times and sometimes you look and you wonder if it's doing any good.
[time=3031] But notice what it says.
[time=3033] Verses 25 says she shall rejoice when in time to come.
[time=3038] She shall rejoice in the future.
[time=3042] She will live to see the day when her children rise up to call her blessed.
[time=3047] And when they come back home after they've been away from the nest and finally and for once and for all I have a full appreciation of what their heritage has been as that happened to me.
[time=3057] I remember going back home after Don and I were married and we left and set up our own home and going back home and for the first time really appreciating my mother and getting away from that situation to understand what she had done to minister to my life and to pray me through some crises and be able to say to her I do rise up and call you blessed.
[time=3076] And the scripture says that the woman ministers and it's not always fun getting up in the morning early.
[time=3080] It's not always fun caring for the dirty chores that are part of being a mother but the scripture says she will rejoice in time to come.
[time=3089] The passage also has something to say about the integrity of her mouth.
[time=3093] She speaks with wisdom.
[time=3095] She speaks with kindness.
[time=3098] Last but not least I want to talk for just a moment about her beauty, her fidelity and her industry and her ministry and her integrity.
[time=3108] And last but not least her beauty.
[time=3111] Verse 30 says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman who fears the Lord shall be praised.
[time=3119] The word favor in this text should be translated by the word charm.
[time=3124] The word beauty actually has within the nuances of the verb that which is often looked to as a means of describing a woman's beauty that is her figure or her shape.
[time=3138] Now notice what the scripture says.
[time=3140] Charm is deceitful and shapeliness is vain but a woman who fears the Lord shall be praised.
[time=3151] And the word fear is the Old Testament word for faith and belief.
[time=3155] It's used 150 times in the Old Testament and it is the counterpart of the New Testament word faith and trust and belief.
[time=3161] And it says that a woman who believes in God, a woman who has faith in God creates within her the source of inner beauty that reaches out to people.
[time=3171] And though these other things may for a season be very important and though charm and shapeliness and beauty may capture the attention of young women, they learn along the way that that's not always a lasting outreach of beauty from inside but a woman who fears the Lord.
[time=3191] Oh, that kind of woman has a beauty.
[time=3194] The world can't copy.
[time=3196] She is really the woman who has come to understand what supermom is all about.
[time=3202] She has come to trust Christ.
[time=3205] She has come to be a godly woman.
[time=3207] And the Bible says that that kind of a woman
[time=3213] who through her fidelity and her industry and her ministry and her integrity and her beauty lives the godly life is a woman who has praised three times.
[time=3226] First of all, her children rise up to call her blessed.
[time=3230] Secondly, we have here the quotation from her husband.
[time=3234] It says here, had her husband also praiseeth her and if you would put quotation marks around verse 29, this is what he says, daughters have done virtuously but thou excelest them all.
[time=3245] That's where the title supermom comes from.
[time=3248] Thou excelest them all.
[time=3250] Why?
[time=3252] Because you have God living out his life through you and all of these characteristics.
[time=3257] And then finally, her works praise her.
[time=3259] Women may be discouraging sometimes to be plugged into the mundane schedule of an everyday life as a homemaker, but I want to promise you if you do what God asks you to do from his word, your children will rise up to call you blessed.
[time=3273] Your husband will praise you and the fruit of your works will be manifested in the future and you will be glad.
[time=3282] Shall we pray?
[time=3284] Father, we're so grateful for thy word.
[time=3289] We're so thankful for the testimony of the scripture.
[time=3293] This character or study of a godly woman is a challenge in today's world.
[time=3301] I believe, Lord, that it's possible for women to live that way today.
[time=3305] Just as I believe the admonitions to men are possible in our world.
[time=3310] And so I would pray that if there are gals here today to whom the Spirit of God has been speaking in some of these areas and their heart has been prepared in a special way for the truth, that you will cause them to be responsive as the Spirit of God should lead.
[time=3326] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed, if you do not know Jesus Christ, if the fear of God is not in your heart as we've explained, you can know him today on this mother's day, whether you be man or woman boy or girl, you can reach out by faith to receive Jesus Christ by simply inviting him to come into your life and be your savior.
[time=3347] Confessing that you're a sinner and asking Christ to be your redeemer today.
[time=3354] Will you do that right now where you are, seated in front of a television someplace or right here in this auditorium?
[time=3359] Just say, Lord Jesus, I want to know what it means to have God living his life out through me.
[time=3365] I wanna be a godly woman.
[time=3368] I wanna be the kind of influence in my home that will make a difference in our culture in the lives of my children.
[time=3375] And so I invite Christ into my life right now and I receive him as my savior.
[time=3381] If you pray that prayer and you're watching or listening, I trust that you will let us know so that we can send you something that will help you in your growth.
[time=3390] Here in this auditorium in just a moment, we're gonna give you an opportunity to respond if you've prayed that prayer.
[time=3396] May God cause you to reach out by faith.
