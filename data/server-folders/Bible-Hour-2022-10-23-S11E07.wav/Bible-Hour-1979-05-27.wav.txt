[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne,
[time=30] Indiana. We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerramon.
[time=60] Thank you for the good singing you may be seated.
[time=89] There is a legend that says that at one time in the past the devil called a
[time=96] conclave of his wisest demons to discuss how they might together be used to keep
[time=103] men and women out of heaven and to send as many as possible to the flames of hell. One demon stepped up in the middle of the meeting according to this fictional story and said let us go and tell men that there is no God if they do
[time=118] not believe in God then certainly they will not be caused to accept his son and they will miss heaven. No said the devil some of them will believe that but most men have sense enough to know that there is a God behind creation that argument will never work. Another demon stepped up and he said let's tell men
[time=137] that the Bible is not the word of God. If they do not believe the Bible to be the word of God then they will not accept its truth concerning salvation. No said the devil most men will know that the inspiration of the Bible is something that can be demonstrated through history. That will never work we cannot use that. Another demon suggested let us tell men that there is no hell to
[time=159] be shunned and there's no heaven to be gained. If we can make them believe that what will be the sense of they're trying to gain heaven and shun hell. They will not believe it said the devil they know better. Finally one brilliant demon stepped
[time=175] up and he said let us tell them that there is a God. Let us tell them that the Bible is the word of God that there is a heaven and that there is a hell. Let us also tell them that they need to be saved but that they need not to be in a hurry. There is plenty of time. That will damn them said the demon. None of
[time=196] them have any better sense than to believe that. Multitudes will fall for the idea of procrastination and that will cause more men to be in hell than any
[time=208] ploy we might use. I believe that history has proven that though this be a fictional
[time=215] story the point of it is true. What we do sometime we do no time and the Bible is
[time=223] full of warnings against the peril of resisting God. The difficulty of
[time=231] developing calluses of the soul. That's the subject of our message today from the
[time=237] 24th chapter of the book of Acts and I trust that your heart will be prepared
[time=243] throughout these moments by the ministry of music as we look toward that time in
[time=249] our service. Right now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir directed by Pastor Don Krueger as they sing a song that was written by our
[time=258] good friend Don Wertzen who reminds us of the importance of yesterday today and tomorrow.
[time=282] Yesterday, yesterday died for me yesterday, yesterday died for me, this is
[time=301] his story, today he lives for me, today, today he lives for me, today, today he lives for me
[time=329] this is victory, today he lives for me, he lives for me, he lives for me, he lives for me
[time=357] this is mystery, how a friend do you know him, know him, know him, how a friend do you know him
[time=381] how a friend do you know him, do you know him, Jesus Christ the Lord, Jesus Christ the Lord
[time=398] I don't know if you can appreciate as I do the wonderful way that our
[time=418] minister of music looks ahead to the themes and topics of the messages and sermons and so wonderfully chooses a music that helped to point toward the
[time=428] direction and impact of the ministry of the Word of God he's coming now to sing
[time=434] for us a beautiful song entitled Calvary covers it all
[time=452] far nearer than all that the world could impart was the message that came to my heart
[time=473] how that Jesus alone, for my sin did it all, Calvary covers it all, Calvary covers it all
[time=501] all my past with its sin and sin, my guilt and despair Jesus took on him
[time=520] Calvary covers it all
[time=539] did you ever think that your sins were too great or maybe too many and God would never ever forgive you
[time=549] well I have good news because the Word of God has said though your sins be as scarlet that's the very worst stain to remove though they are as the worst
[time=560] stains they shall be as wide as snow that's what God does to a sinner who comes by faith
[time=568] to the cross and accepts the cleansing of the blood of Jesus Christ, no life to
[time=574] stain, no sin to grate but that Calvary covers it all
[time=587] how much less the grace when I looked on the face of Jesus my crucified Lord
[time=607] my redemption complete I then found at his feet
[time=621] Calvary covers it all
[time=635] my past with its sin and sin, all my guilt, all my despair
[time=649] Jesus took on him there and Calvary covers it all
[time=663] yes Calvary covers it all
[time=681] thank you so much for joining with us today on the Bible Hour and especially
[time=693] for letting us have this privilege of coming into your living room and sitting down to chat with you about the Bible Hour and its ministry to you and your own home.
[time=703] We appreciate so much your faithfulness and being a part of this time we spend together each week and a special word of appreciation is extended to all of those who are part of our Founders Club a family group of people who stay with us both in their prayer support
[time=718] and in their financial support if it were not for you folks we wouldn't be on the air today and we appreciate you a great deal Donna we have been praying together that God would enable us to find a way to help the Founders Club keep the Bible Hour in the black in terms
[time=737] of its own self support we have gone through some pretty difficult times financially with this ministry you probably more than anyone else know the wear and tear that that takes off all of us but we have a pretty good idea of how we can incorporate the help of a lot
[time=753] of families to make sure that the Bible Hour stays on the air and maintains its financial stability I'd like for you to share just a little bit about that program and I'll fill in the empty places.
[time=765] I'm really excited about the possibilities of this new program not only for you but for your loved ones as well what we are encouraging you to do is if you have someone special in
[time=775] your life or maybe someone special who has passed away that you would like to honor and recognize we are suggesting that you sponsor the Bible Hour in your area for one Sunday
[time=787] in honor of that person and if you choose to do that we will send you a beautiful little
[time=793] plaque inscribed saying that you have sponsored the program on a specific day in honor of someone
[time=799] who is special to you and then you will have that as a permanent keepsake of the way you have recognized that individual Donna so many times people use fading gifts to honor those
[time=816] they love you know we obviously as a part of the ministry have had part in many many memorial services and I think flowers and gifts like that are beautiful but they last only for
[time=827] a moment and one of the great things we're excited about is the fact that Christian people
[time=834] can use this means of giving to the Lord's work to provide the opportunity for the gospel to be preached and the Bible tells us that God's word abides forever that it never fades away and if just one person hears the message of God's word through the preaching that Sunday on a given Sunday think what a tremendous excitement that would be to the people who have had a part in making it possible we get letters from many folks who say I wish there was something I could do to get the word out to get the gospel out and we're excited about the fact that many of our friends can preach the gospel on a particular Sunday in their town through the Bible hour by getting underneath the support of this ministry through what we're calling the sponsors club and we're excited about it we heard from some folks this week who are interested in I think I ought to relate to our friends that we have a letter that's going out to all of our mailing list this week explaining the nature of the sponsors club and Donna right here in the middle of our little chat together if people are interested in more information and perhaps aren't on our mailing list how would they get in touch with us you just simply need to write to pastor David Jeremiah at post office
[time=901] box one five two five oh Fort Wayne Indiana the zip code is four six eight one five another
[time=908] aspect of this that is exciting to me is a number of people have parents who have everything
[time=915] quote unquote when it comes time for an anniversary or a birthday they think oh what can I possibly
[time=921] give them because they have everything and this would be a fantastic way of honoring them at those times I think that would be especially true Donna for parents of children
[time=931] who are who are godly people in other words I think it would be exciting for us to do that for your parents or for mine because they have given to us such a rich spiritual heritage and we've we've just benefited from that so much and it would be kind of a neat thing to be able to do that in their name and to say to them thank you for what you've done and in your name we're going to continue to spread the word that you so well communicated to us so we hope that many of you will get excited about this if we can have a hundred
[time=958] families across the Bible our network who would take the responsibility of sponsoring
[time=964] the Bible our in their area for one Sunday it would do a tremendous amount of good in
[time=971] the stabilizing of the Bible our ministry now this is not the ordinary average kind of gift this is a sizable gift to the Bible our but I know that there are many people who
[time=982] are capable of doing it and that God will lay this burden upon the hearts of some who want to do this in the name of the Lord and then one of the thing we ought to say is that when you do sponsor the Bible our as we chat together here each Sunday on the Sunday when
[time=997] the Bible our is sponsored by you which you obviously have a choice to determine we're going to say that we're going to say the Bible our was sponsored in South Bend by Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so in honor of their mother or whatever of course with your permission that will be fun to do one it sure will it's neat to get people involved not just a mass audience
[time=1018] but individuals and families and that's what the Bible our is it's a very personal communication means from us to them we need to say just a word about our free gift offer and Donnie
[time=1030] you do that so well I'll hold the book and you talk about it I even had a phone call requesting one of those this week at home it's the four gospels arranged as a single narrative and it's really a handy Bible study tool as we've found out because so many of you have requested a copy of it and the feedback that we've had from you on it is really exciting because it's a helpful tool to you as you study the Bible and if you would like to have your free copy of it just drop us a note and say that you would like your copy of the free gospels and right to pastor David Jeremiah post office box one five two five oh Fort Wayne Indiana
[time=1067] we keep thinking we're going to stop offering this and yet we keep getting so many requests for it which means there's still many people who have yet to receive their free copy of the four gospels arranged as a single narrative so if you haven't received yours yet the time is running out one of these days we're not going to do this anymore so you write to us and let us know and write to me pastor David Jeremiah post office box one five two five
[time=1090] oh Fort Wayne Indiana now we go back to our morning service and in just a few moments I'm going to open the word of God to the twenty fourth chapter of the book of Acts get your Bibles ready piece of paper and a pencil we'll be studying the word of God in just a moment
[time=1129] and I'm going to do that.

[time=1394] Oh why did I wait so long to learn such a living song and how did I stay?
[time=1410] So close without seeing him.
[time=1418] Let me see him clean before my Lord I stand and in me not one blemish does he see.
[time=1436] When I placed all my burdens on him he washed them all from me.
[time=1448] So why do you wait so long to learn such a living song and how can you stay so close
[time=1468] without seeing him never seen him clean before my Lord I stand and in me not one blemish does he see.
[time=1490] When I placed all my burdens on him he washed them all from me.
[time=1502] He washed them all from me.
[time=1522] Thank you Starr.
[time=1524] I want you to take your Bibles and turn with me today to the 24th chapter of the book of Acts,
[time=1530] chapter 24 and verse 24, Acts 24, 24.
[time=1540] And we shall read the four verses that are contained in the remaining portion of the 24th chapter of the book of Acts.
[time=1552] Our Bibles open and let us follow along in your Bible as I read from mine.
[time=1564] And after certain days when Felix came with his wife, Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he set for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
[time=1568] And as he reasoned of righteousness, self-control and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, "Go thy way for this time.
[time=1578] And I have a convenient season I will call for thee." He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul and that he might loose him, wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.
[time=1590] But after two years, Porsches Festus came into Felix Palace and Felix willing to show the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.
[time=1600] Shall we pray?
[time=1604] Now our Father, we come into thy presence, having first of all read thy word, this portion of a narrative from a New Testament story.
[time=1614] And we would pray that you would superintend in the preaching and teaching of thy word in these next moments so that we will first of all understand the sense of the Scripture.
[time=1626] And that secondly, we may be able to apply the sense of the Scripture to our own hearts and make that application, Father, as pointed as it needs to be, so that the work of the Holy Spirit can be accomplished in each of our lives.
[time=1640] As we pray that your Word will minister to each one gathered here in this auditorium, we pray also that wherever men and women, boys and girls and young people hear this word through television,
[time=1652] she will help them in these next moments to set aside the cares of other things and to concentrate on what God might say to them through His Holy Word, the Scripture.
[time=1662] We give you praise for what you're going to do. We have the promise from God Himself that His Word shall not return unto Him void, but it shall accomplish the thing where unto it has been sent.
[time=1674] In light of that promise, we preach the Scriptures with great expectation, knowing that we but sow the seed that God might bring forth the harvest, and we pray that the harvest might be plentiful.
[time=1686] Not only today, but in the days ahead as the seed grows in the hearts of men and women, for we pray in His name, the matchless name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[time=1698] Alexander the Great was visiting a poor philosopher by the name of Deogenes one time.
[time=1708] When Deogenes asked him a very interesting question, Deogenes said, "Alexander, if you were not Alexander the Great, who would you like to be?"
[time=1720] Without a moment's hesitation, the great Alexander said, "If I were not Alexander the Great, I would like to be Deogenes."
[time=1732] That seems rather strange to us at first blush, the great conqueror of the world wishing if he could not be himself that he be a poor philosopher.
[time=1742] But in light of history, it is not, nor should it be considered, an unwise choice.
[time=1750] For it demonstrates something that those who have studied history know to be definitely true, that it is better for the sake of ongoing perpetuity to be a thinker than it is to sit upon a throne.
[time=1762] Stop for a moment and think of some of the great men who have captured their thoughts on paper, men such as Shakespeare and Milton, men like Bacon, and try for just a moment to think of the monarchs under whose reign they wrote and thought.
[time=1784] And you will realize immediately that one who thinks clearly and puts that down on paper for others to read has a much better chance of going down through the annals and halls of history being recognized and revered than one who simply reigns on the throne of the kingdom.
[time=1802] The story which we have read today is an illustration of that, for here is the record of a man by the name of Felix.
[time=1810] And it is obvious that we would never have heard his name mentioned had it not been for his association with the great apologist, the Apostle Paul.
[time=1822] But because of his encounter over a period of two years with the great Paul, he has come to be known to men everywhere through the pages of the Holy Record.
[time=1832] And we know of the pro-curator of Judea because he had an association with the Apostle Paul.
[time=1840] History tells us that Antonius Felix, whose name is mentioned in these verses that I have read, was Greek by birth.
[time=1848] He was the younger brother of a man named Paulus, who was the favorite son of Emperor Claudius.
[time=1856] Because of his relationship with Paulus, he was granted a great number of privileges in the Roman Empire.
[time=1864] Josephus and Tacitus, the secular historians who record the events of this period of time, tell us that Felix was appointed pro-curator of Judea in AD 53.
[time=1876] He was a cruel governor.
[time=1878] Though we only have his name mentioned in the text that we have read today, Tacitus, the Roman historian, writes concerning Felix these words.
[time=1886] He said through all cruelty and licentiousness, he exercised the authority of a king with the mind and the spirit of a slave.
[time=1896] The authority of a king with the mind of a slave.
[time=1900] Tacitus says this was the epitome of the man Felix.
[time=1906] We would not even be introduced to him by name were it not for a plot on the life of the Apostle Paul.
[time=1914] The synopsis of that plot can be found in your copies of the scripture in the 23rd chapter of the Book of Acts, and it is summarized in the 12th verse.
[time=1924] Here we read that there were certain Jews who banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed the Apostle Paul.
[time=1936] These religious zealots who felt that Paul was intruding into the purity of Judaism had determined with a blood oath that they would not eat nor sleep until Paul was executed.
[time=1950] There followed this blood oath, a very devious attempt on the part of these 40+ men to take Paul in ambush and take his life from him.
[time=1962] If you have time to read the record in the 23rd and 24th chapters, you will find a very interesting historical narrative concerning Paul's deliverance from their attempt.
[time=1972] It seems that his nephew overheard them planning the ambush, and when he heard the plans he went to see the chief captain of the Roman army, a man by the name of Lysius, and he told Lysius what was being planned.
[time=1988] And since Lysius did not want to have any Roman citizen murdered under his jurisdiction, according to the scripture, he gathered together some 470 men, and during the third hour of the night these 470 men came and took Paul away.
[time=2004] And they took him to Caesarea where Felix, the pro-curator, was in order that he might be brought before him and judged concerning the accusations that were made against his person.
[time=2016] At the end of chapter 23, Felix is now talking with Paul, and when he has arrived in Caesarea, Paul has arrived in Caesarea.
[time=2026] Felix says at the end of chapter 23, "I will hear thee when thine accusers are come, and he commanded Paul to be put in Herod's judgment hall."
[time=2038] Felix said, "When your accusers are able to make it here to Caesarea for the trial, then I will hear you," and he sent Paul away to the judgment hall of Herod to await his trial.
[time=2050] Now five days pass, according to the scripture, Paul's accusers arrive, and they bring along with them a young man by the name of Tertullus, who is a great orator, and who in our understanding of things today would be the prosecuting attorney, the attorney general.
[time=2064] And according to the record, Tertullus stands before Felix, and he makes charges against Paul, basically with the same old charges that Paul always seemed to find in his trail, charges of sedition, charges of disturbing the peace, charges of profaning the temple, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2082] All of them trumped up charge, and though Tertullus was a great orator, when he sat down having charged the apostle Paul, Paul got up to speak for himself.
[time=2092] And the record is a beautiful story. He answered every one of the charges after the usual amenities that were addressed to Felix.
[time=2102] And then he gave a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ in his own life, told how he had become a Christian and how he was committed to the resurrection of the dead and the person of Jesus Christ, and standing before that ungodly Felix, he gave a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2120] Well, Felix, who was known for indecisiveness, didn't know what to do. He was overwhelmed with Paul's person, and so he did what many of us do when we don't know what to do. He procrastinated.
[time=2134] He said, Paul, I don't know what to do with you in essence, and so I'm going to put you back in prison and when lysius, the chief captain of the Roman army can come and personally be here for the trial, then I'll bring you back and we'll decide what to do.
[time=2148] And so the 24th chapter of the book of Acts is a record of the trial, the tribunal before which Paul stood. Now that brings us to the 24th verse of this chapter, which we read a few moments ago.
[time=2162] Paul is living under house arrest. The terms of his confinement are recorded in verse 23, where we read that Felix commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintances to minister or come unto him.
[time=2178] That verse in itself tells us what kind of an impression Paul made upon the wicked Felix, for he did not put him in the barracks or in the jail. He gave him the liberty of house arrest, and he said, you can even have your friends come and minister to you, Paul, you don't have to be afraid of them.
[time=2194] And so here Paul was in house arrest and the scripture records what happened. After certain days, Felix came with his wife, Drew Silla, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
[time=2210] While Felix was waiting for lysius to come and make the accusations personally against Paul, he desired to have more information about the way which Paul championed.
[time=2220] And so the scripture says, in order to while away the time, he invited Paul to preach a sermon to him and to his mistress, Drew Silla.
[time=2228] That, for Felix, was a fatal mistake. To invite the great apostle into the palace, there to preach a sermon to him and his wife.
[time=2238] It was a memorable sermon that Paul preached that day. We don't have much of the text, just the outline, but it was a great sermon.
[time=2246] Someone has written that he preached as all ministers ought to preach. He preached as never to preach again. He preached as a dying man to dying men.
[time=2256] And as he stood before the great procurator of Judea, he addressed him in terms that were never to be forgotten in the years of this great leader.
[time=2264] His preaching was not a discussion of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. It was not some great high and lofty teaching that he might have gotten in his study in Phariseeism, but he got right to the point.
[time=2278] He preached a message which would never be forgotten by that leader. It is interesting to me as I've studied this text of scripture that his personal message in confrontation with Felix was a strong and dynamic and pointed as his message in front of the whole court.
[time=2296] Now, Luke, the historian who has recorded these events for us, tells us that his message had three points. He was a good homilatician. He had three points to his message.
[time=2308] According to the scripture, his message was as follows. He preached of righteousness and of temperance and of the judgment to come.
[time=2316] Now, that's a good three-pointed sermon, and it will never be understood unless you understand the circumstances to which Paul addressed himself.
[time=2324] First of all, the scripture says he preached of righteousness. That was part of his sermon, not only because it is an important part of the gospel message, but because of what he knew about Felix.
[time=2336] For the historical record concerning Felix is that he was an unrighteous ruler. He was a cruel judge. He was a finagler, a dishonest man who used whatever means were at his disposal to finagle that which he desired for his own use.
[time=2352] You can get just a glimpse of his nature as you look down at the end of this section of scripture and discover that when he was not convicted to the point of decision in relationship to Paul's message that he decided to keep Paul around and to see if he could get any money from him.
[time=2368] It says that he hoped that money should have been given him of Paul, and so he asked Paul to come in and talk with him often, seeing if he could extort money from him for his release.
[time=2378] The historians tell us that he was one of the most wicked of all of the governors who served in the Roman Empire, and so when Paul stood to preach that day, he chose as his first point, righteousness.
[time=2394] Is it any wonder that Felix began to get nervous? I don't know what passage he used. I don't know how he demonstrated it, but I have an idea that as he did so many other times, Paul went back into his own personal life testimony and told how he had been the most righteous of all of the Pharisees,
[time=2408] that he had been of the strictest sect of the Pharisees, and that all of his righteousnesses became as nothing to him when he stood before the white light of the holiness of Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus.
[time=2420] And as he preached that first point of the message, Felix began to get nervous.
[time=2424] He finished his first point, and he went on to the second. His second point was on temperance or on self-control.
[time=2434] According to Josephus, the historian, Drew Silla, who sat next to Felix on the throne that day, was not really his wife.
[time=2442] The word for wife in the text here is the same word which we translate by the word woman, and we might translate it this way.
[time=2450] Felix came with his woman, Drasilla, and that's exactly what it was, for the history of Drew Silla is interesting.
[time=2458] According to Josephus, Drew Silla was the daughter of Herod Agrippa.
[time=2464] Now, there's so many Herod's in the Bible, it's often hard to keep them straight, but Herod Agrippa is the one about whom we read in the 12th chapter of the book of Acts.
[time=2472] Who tried to take the life of Peter and did take the life of James and was ultimately eaten by worms because he claimed himself to be a God.
[time=2480] His daughter was Drew Silla. In her early life, Drew Silla was married to a king, a king of a Mesa.
[time=2490] And this king became a Jew in order that he might be married to this Jewess, Drew Silla.
[time=2498] According to the historic record, Felix one day saw Drew Silla.
[time=2504] And even though she was married to another man, he determined to have her for himself.
[time=2510] And so according to the record, he hired a magician by the name of Simon.
[time=2514] And Simon, using his sorcery and his persuasive power, caused Drew Silla to be willing to dump her husband and come and live with the procurator Felix.
[time=2526] And so here he was living in the palace with a woman who was not his wife whom he had stolen from someone else.
[time=2532] They were not even officially married, they were just doing what so many do today, they were living together and who's going to say anything about it when it's the procurator, the governor.
[time=2540] And so Paul stood before the two of them as they sat there in the royal palace and he preached to them on self control and temperance and righteousness.
[time=2550] And as he moved from the first point to the second point, the conviction began to grow even more in the hearts of these two people.
[time=2558] Drew Silla looked at Felix and Felix looked at Drew Silla and they wondered what in the world they'd gotten themselves into inviting this man to come in here.
[time=2566] They thought they were going to get some intellectual discussion about the importance of Judaism and Christianity, but instead Paul took his finger as did Nathan the prophet in the Old Testament.
[time=2576] And in essence he said, "Thou art the man, you're the one who's living like this."
[time=2582] And having finished his second point, he went on to the third and concluding point which must have been a vivid reminder to these who were sitting in the place of jurisprudence.
[time=2592] And he said, "I want to talk to you thirdly now about the judgment to come."
[time=2598] Ugg, Drew Silla, clear to throat, Felix looked over the head of the one who spoke to him out into the distance so he wouldn't have to meet the eyes of his preacher turned accuser.
[time=2614] And Paul in essence as he wove that point together said, "I'm sure just as you sit here today on this throne of judgment, and as I stand here before you to give answer for these false accusations,
[time=2626] Felix, you and Drew Silla some day shall stand before the great tribunal, God himself who looks beyond the outward expressions of the heart and down into the inward motivations of man,
[time=2638] and Felix, you and Drew Silla some day shall stand before him and give an account of your sin, and of your unrighteousness, and of your sexual immorality.
[time=2648] Some day you'll stand before God and be judged for there is judgment to come."
[time=2656] It was a powerful message he preached that day in the palace.
[time=2660] He didn't mince any words.
[time=2662] He preached his men out to preach, cutting it straight from the scripture, calling sin sin.
[time=2672] The scripture says that Felix trembled.
[time=2680] It's interesting is it not that we call this episode Paul before Felix, but in essence it was Felix before Paul.
[time=2690] Now notice the scripture says that he reasoned of righteousness and self-control and judgment to come and Felix trembled.
[time=2700] It was the conviction in his heart.
[time=2702] I don't know what brought the conviction.
[time=2704] Perhaps it was the power of Paul's words.
[time=2708] It could have been that he knew something about the righteous life of his preacher.
[time=2712] The Bible tells us that there is no power like the power of a controlled and righteous life.
[time=2718] Earlier in this episode, which we have read from today, Paul had been brought before the magistrate and he had been accused.
[time=2726] The story, when you have a chance to read it, he was accused by the high priest, but he didn't know it was the high priest.
[time=2732] And it's interesting to me that Paul was a human because when the high priest accused him, slapped him in the face,
[time=2738] Paul called a man a white enseplaker.
[time=2742] He said, "Now white enseplaker?" That's the way they used to talk nasty to people in the old times, you know?
[time=2752] And he had ever reason to say that.
[time=2756] And then someone said, "Don't you know that you're talking to the high priest and you know what he did?" He apologized.
[time=2762] He said, "Everything I said in essence was true, but if I'd have known it was the high priest, I'd never said it, I was wrong."
[time=2768] Even though he had every justification, that's a demonstration of the kind of man Paul was.
[time=2772] He was a holy, righteous man who never stepped out of line without being corrected and being willing to admit his sin.
[time=2780] Perhaps it was the righteous life of Paul that Felix knew about as he stood before him that day.
[time=2784] Perhaps it was Paul's pointed application of the truth to the needs of that man.
[time=2790] Perhaps it was his reasoning.
[time=2792] The Scripture says Paul reasoned with him that day.
[time=2794] The word in the text is the word "dialegomai." It means to reason against, to take points like this and reason them back and forth and bring conviction.
[time=2802] It's the word that's used of Paul almost all throughout the book of Acts.
[time=2806] He reasoned, he dialogued with him to show him the points he was making.
[time=2812] And the result of that was great conviction and power came upon Felix and he trembled.
[time=2818] But I want you to notice Paul's preaching in the Spirit's power, but thirdly will you note Felix postponement.
[time=2826] He said what so many before and after him have said.
[time=2828] Even though he was at the point of conviction, he said go thy way for this time.
[time=2834] Paul, when I have a convenient season I will call for the immediate delay.
[time=2842] He had come from the place of curiosity about the gospel.
[time=2846] He had been brought by the Spirit of God to the place of conviction of his sin.
[time=2850] But he could not make the commitment that was necessary even though he was under tremendous conviction.
[time=2856] And the Scripture says he began to develop the callus on his soul.
[time=2860] He said no, I'll not do it now.
[time=2862] You come back at a more convenient time and he dismissed Paul.
[time=2866] He's very similar in his reaction to another royal person to whom Paul later spoke,
[time=2872] whose testimony is recorded in the 26th chapter of the book of Acts in verse 28.
[time=2878] When Paul stood before Agrippa and presented the gospel to him, King Agrippa said unto Paul, almost thou persuade us to me to become a Christian.
[time=2888] Almost is not good enough and it was not good enough for Felix that day and he dismissed Paul and sent him away.
[time=2894] One of the things that we often miss as we study this passage of Scripture is that that was not the last time he ever confronted Paul.
[time=2904] It wasn't as if he were brought to the point of conviction and he dismissed Paul and Paul never entered into his life again.
[time=2910] For the Scripture tells us there was a continued resistance.
[time=2914] Paul was remanded to the Roman province where Felix was the procurator
[time=2920] and he was under his leadership in that little place for two years.
[time=2924] And the Scripture says that because Felix wanted to extort money from Paul, that during that two-year period he brought Paul into the palace room to talk with him.
[time=2932] You say it doesn't say what Paul said.
[time=2934] I don't have to ask that question because I know Paul.
[time=2936] I know what he said every time he stood before that wicked Felix.
[time=2940] He reminded him of his need of Christ.
[time=2942] He reminded him of the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[time=2946] He told him if he kept going the same way he was going he would end up in a Christless eternity.
[time=2950] And for two years Felix heard that over and over again as Paul came into the palace to be talked to.
[time=2956] And there's no record that he ever did anything about it.
[time=2960] He continued over and over again to reject.
[time=2966] Someone has written these words, pulpits and Sundays, sorrow-dogging sin, afflictions sorted,
[time=2974] anguish of all sizes, without our shame, within our consciences.
[time=2984] Yet all these fences and their whole array, one cunning bosom sin, will quite blow away.
[time=2990] What was the matter with Felix?
[time=2992] He heard the truth, he had been under conviction, but he was in sin and he didn't want to do anything about it.
[time=2998] And so even though all of this was happening in his life and he heard the message over and over again, he did not accept it because he was harboring the pet sin of his own immorality and unrighteousness
[time=3008] and he would not have any of this Jesus Christ who was the righteous one.
[time=3014] Felix was one of the men who would learn to understand the truth of Genesis chapter 6 verse 3,
[time=3020] which says, "And my spirit shall not always strive with men." Though we have the record of his conviction when Paul preached in the palace, there's no word in the rest of these verses that he ever again came to that point in his life where he trembled at the sound of the gospel.
[time=3036] Perhaps it became old hat to him as Paul day after day told him the same story.
[time=3040] It never again got him where he lived. It never again caused his heart to pound faster.
[time=3044] It never again caused him to realize that he was headed in the wrong direction.
[time=3048] He became used to it.
[time=3050] The calluses began to develop on his soul and it became easier and easier for him to put Paul off
[time=3056] and not to accept the message that Paul shared with him.
[time=3060] That's why in your bulletins under the title of this message there is this word from Job, who have hardened himself against him and hath prospered.
[time=3070] Reminds us of the rich young ruler whose word is recorded in the 12th chapter of the book of Luke
[time=3076] who said, "Tomorrow I'm going to do this and tomorrow I'm going to do that.
[time=3080] I'm going to build new barns to care for all that I have built and I'm going to do all of this tomorrow in some more convenient season and the Lord said, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee, then who shall these things be?"
[time=3096] The story of the man Felix is finally told in the last words of the 24th chapter.
[time=3106] But after two years, Porsches Festus came on to Felix's place and Felix willing to show the Jews a favor left Paul bound.
[time=3114] The Roman emperor sent for Felix to give an account of his stewardship
[time=3120] of the cruelty that he'd exercised over the Jewish people.
[time=3122] They called for him to leave Caesarea where he was ruling and another man came to take his place.
[time=3130] Reminds us that the years of our salvation pass on until someone else sits in the place in the pew which we have occupied.
[time=3140] Porsches Festus sat in the place where Felix had sat.
[time=3146] Felix was removed from the source of conviction, removed from the source of the information of the gospel.
[time=3152] His curiosity and his conviction did not bring him to a place of commitment
[time=3158] but calloused his soul and there came a day when as if God in heaven reached down and took Felix out of the place of conviction and put somebody else in his place.
[time=3166] We never hear about him again and as far as we know he never accepted Christ.
[time=3170] He never accepted Christ as his personal savior.
[time=3174] It's no wonder that Paul wrote to the Corinthians in the second book
[time=3182] which he penned to them in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 2.
[time=3186] Behold now is the accepted time.
[time=3188] Behold now is the day of salvation.
[time=3194] There is a story told of another year and another time concerning a young fellow who went to hear a preacher speak and was greatly moved.
[time=3204] The preacher said when you have a religious impression and when the Spirit of God speaks to you you ought to act upon it right then.
[time=3212] And the young boy believing the preacher's message came down the aisle of that little church down at the bottom of a big mountain and gave his heart to the Lord Jesus.
[time=3220] The next morning he went back to the sawmill in the mountains where he worked and those who observed him said he sang all morning as he worked.
[time=3230] He had a new song in his heart and that's what Jesus does for you when you're saved.
[time=3234] All morning long he talked about his new relationship with the Lord Jesus.
[time=3238] Toward noon he was working next to some large machinery mechanical apparatus
[time=3244] and somehow lost his footing and slipped and was caught in the gears of the machinery and his little body was mangled until he was about to pass out of this life.
[time=3254] In the last moments as he was there in the camp he asked that someone go and get the preacher who had spoken the night before.
[time=3258] The one down at the bottom of the mountain who preached last night and somehow in a hurried frenzy they found the preacher and brought him to the mountain camp.
[time=3268] The preacher bent over the dying fellow and took his hand and he said Charlie I have come.
[time=3272] What would you like to say?
[time=3276] With a smile on his face that is hard to understand in a situation like that he gently pressed the hand of that preacher and he said wasn't it a glorious thing that I settled it in time?
[time=3290] Wasn't it a glorious thing that I settled it in time?
[time=3296] As I heard the news come over the wire this week and watched on television and saw the pictures in the paper of the tragedy that took place in Chicago I thought of that perhaps as only a preacher can think of it and I wondered how many of those 279 people had thought that someday they would get things right with God
[time=3316] but in a moment unexpected in a holiday spirit their lives were snuffed out and there was no chance.
[time=3322] It is a terrible thing to resist God when he speaks we must listen.
[time=3332] Shall we pray?
[time=3338] Father in heaven we pray that you would not allow anyone who has heard my voice today
[time=3352] to withstand the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their life in their heart.
[time=3360] Some have stood right here in this building in the past and heard God's voice speaking clearly to them.
[time=3366] In the moment of their trembling they have postponed their decision
[time=3372] and they have said as did Felix some more convenient time I will hear the Lord.
[time=3376] And today they have been brought face to face again with the danger of delay.
[time=3384] Lord we recognize that it's not even so much that we might not ever hear the message again.
[time=3390] It's quite possible that people who come here to this church will hear the gospel many many times in the future.
[time=3396] But like Felix they may never tremble under conviction again.
[time=3402] They may like this Roman governor be exposed over and over again to the gospel
[time=3410] but somehow it doesn't mean what it did that moment when the Spirit of God spoke so pointedly to their heart.
[time=3416] Today we believe that by the Spirit you're speaking to hearts in this auditorium.
[time=3420] Speaking to some as you have never spoken to them before some who have yet to receive Jesus Christ some who have rejected him.
