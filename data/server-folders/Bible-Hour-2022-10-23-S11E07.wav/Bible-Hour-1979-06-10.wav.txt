[time=5] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=16] [ Singing ]
[time=66] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=67] >> We are very aware of the greatness of God on this day
[time=76] as we contemplate moving in a little bit to the Arlington Park territory where we're going to be building some new buildings and constructing a campus ministry church, and this afternoon at 3 o'clock or so all of our congregation will be gathering over there for a time of fellowship, and we're going to have our evening services outdoors with the weather cooperating, and we're looking forward with great anticipation to the blessing of this day.
[time=104] And as we think of that, it's just so fitting that we should first of all praise the name of our God.
[time=111] He's the great God, the one who has created the universe and has made possible all that we know and all that we have, and we're so grateful.
[time=120] As I was growing up, I used to read the verse in the book of Hebrews that says that Jesus lived to make intercession for us in heaven, and in my mind's eye, I used to try to imagine what the Lord Jesus prayed
[time=137] in His prayer for all of us who are Christians still on this earth.
[time=142] What could He be praying about for me?
[time=146] And then I made a very interesting discovery.
[time=148] He has given us some insight into His heart as He sits on the right hand of the Father making intercession for us, and that insight is found in the 17th chapter of the book of John, one of the great high and lofty places in God's Word.
[time=164] Today, we begin a study of that prayer, the high priestly prayer of our Savior.
[time=169] For these next few weeks, we'll be studying together the prayer of the Lord Jesus as recorded in the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=177] And I hope your heart will be prepared as we await the moment when we open the Scripture, and we look into the Word of God to hear from our Heavenly Father as we look at His Word.
[time=189] First of all, we have some music, and our choir is prepared to exalt the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, as they remind us of the special, special nature of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=205] # There's something that's different about Him #
[time=215] # For His voice has come near # # And rearranged in sea # # There's something that's different about Him #
[time=232] # For His touch has changed a simple page # # Like me # # When the Lord can explain # # Why life's different since He came # # There's something different about the one # # Who saved His Jesus # # Come say, "He's just a mother # # Oh, He's dead # # Where's the star # # That God in holy shepherds # # And I stand from afar # # When the He was just a child # # He amazed all of God # # And he loves them all # # You could hear the people say #
[time=292] # There's something that's different about Him #
[time=301] # For His voice has come near # # And rearranged in sea # # There's something that's different about Him #
[time=319] # For His touch has changed a simple page # # Like me # # When the Lord can explain # # Why life's different since He came # # There's something different about the one # # Who saved His Jesus # # Some say, "He's just a father # # But His say, "He's just a man # # Some say, "He's just a teacher # # Doing good through our command # # Our goes to learn the best to say # # Please be still what's going to end # # Into each other # # And you can even say #
[time=381] It was just another day of that same road to the same hillside.
[time=389] Just three more criminals being crucified.
[time=392] Many of the spectators had been there before.
[time=395] Just three more crosses, three more men, one more spectacle to entertain the crowd.
[time=403] But there was something different about this crucifixion.
[time=407] The sky blackened as the creator of the universe was suspended between heaven and earth, as though He were rejected.
[time=415] In days past He walked with the people.
[time=418] He healed their sick.
[time=420] He raised their dead.
[time=423] He fed them by the thousands just by multiplying that young boy's lunch.
[time=430] He even walked on the water.
[time=433] They saw all of these miracles, and yet somehow they never really saw Him.
[time=440] His followers proclaimed Him to be king.
[time=443] King of the Jews, where were they now?
[time=447] Had any king ever died such a death?
[time=451] He called Himself the Son of Man.
[time=455] If He were just a man, who rolled the stone away?
[time=459] How was the tomb empty?
[time=462] How did He resurrect on the third day?
[time=465] He wasn't just a man.
[time=468] There was something different about Him.
[time=471] He was this living Son of God.
[time=474] I know because Jesus Christ, God's Son, has transformed my life.
[time=504] There's something different about the one who's here is He.
[time=516] Thank you for that reminder of the beautiful Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=532] The most amazing part of all of that is that that one about whom we have just heard is interested infinitely in you and in me.
[time=540] The Creator of the universe, the one who died upon the cross, came forth from the grave
[time=546] victoriously, is not the triumphant Savior aloof from man, but He is the triumphant Savior who cares about you and about me.
[time=557] And that's what we're going to listen to now in the message of the next song, "Star in Our World" shares with us that Jesus loves us and He cares about us more than we can know.
[time=587] Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=603] He gave His life what more could He give.
[time=614] Oh, how He loves you.
[time=657] He gave His life what more could He give.
[time=667] Oh, how He loves you, how He loves me.
[time=678] Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=694] Jesus, to have redid God.
[time=706] His love for sinners, to show what He did there.
[time=719] Run home from despair and know how He loves you.
[time=731] Oh, how He loves me.
[time=736] Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=751] Oh, how He loves me.
[time=757] Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=781] Thank you for joining us on today's telecast and for letting us have this opportunity while we're receiving the offering here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church of stepping aside to talk with those of you who are viewing at home.
[time=801] We appreciate so much your faithfulness and prayer and support of this particular program and especially during these days as we have inaugurated the sponsors program.
[time=810] We're grateful for the number of you who have responded with interest and with encouragement to us as we begin this new phase of our ministry to underwrite its cost.
[time=821] Donna isn't with me today but seated in her chair and taking her place as a friend of mine by the name of Bill Vanderford.
[time=828] And Bill, you are here on this program today sharing this time with me because you brought something to give me.
[time=835] Yes, I did Pastor, I brought you a check for our family's sponsorship in the Bible Hour this day and it's with privilege that we give that.
[time=844] You were sharing with me just before we went on the year that you did this here in the Fort Wayne area to underwrite the cost of the Bible Hour here locally for a very special reason and in honor of somebody that means a great deal to you.
[time=857] Yes, we did, the Bible Hour means much to our family and we wanted to do something very special for two special people in our lives and that's my grandparents, Bill and Henry out of Vanderford.
[time=867] So today is their 56th Wayne anniversary and in honor that we want to sponsor the Bible Hour.
[time=873] Is there any possibility that they might be sharing this telecast today?
[time=877] I'm sure they're watching it right now.
[time=879] Well, it's a great excitement for us to be able to minister to them in a very special way and Bill, we who are part of the Bible Hour Office staff and all of us as the Black Hawk Baptist Church and its ministries want to express our appreciation to you for helping us in this way.
[time=894] And I trust that what you have done today will be an encouragement to a great number of other people who will see the opportunity of giving a gift like this to underwrite the cost of the television program in their area.
[time=906] We'd not only like to see it happen in Fort Wayne, but in South Bend and Indianapolis and Chicago, wherever the telecast is seen.
[time=913] Bill, in just a few days you'll be receiving a plaque that we're very excited about that will cause you to remember this particular occasion and the plaque says that you preach the gospel to all the people in Fort Wayne in honor of your grandparents and it will have their names on the plaque.
[time=930] And just a word of appreciation that you can keep on your desk or hang up in your office down there on State Street or whatever that you choose to do with it just as a reminder of the investments you've made in the Lord's work.
[time=942] I think sometimes people think that the preaching and the work and the ministry is all done from the pulpit.
[time=949] But obviously if people aren't behind what we're doing financially, there isn't any way the pulpit ministry can go on, the music ministry can go on.
[time=958] So it's really true, today you're helping us preach.
[time=961] I know you don't consider yourself to be a preacher, at least not to my knowledge, but God's given you an ability in some other areas and you've helped us today to get the word out and we're appreciative of that.
[time=971] I'm very thankful to be a part of it.
[time=974] We hope that others of you who are interested in the sponsors program will let us know of your interest and if we can be of help in providing information to you so that you can get involved in helping in the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=986] If you would just write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=993] And when you write, request information on the sponsors program and we'll be happy to send it your way.
[time=999] We're also very happy to acknowledge your request for a special book that we're offering during these days.
[time=1005] We have continued to send out hundreds of copies of this book.
[time=1008] The four gospels arranged as a single narrative and since we've had so many requests for it, we keep making it available and as long as you keep writing, we'll keep mailing them to you.
[time=1018] We trust that if you haven't received your copy already, you will write and request this free book.
[time=1023] Once again, the address for this free offer into your home is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1034] When you write, request the book on the four gospels and we'll see that is sent to you this week.
[time=1039] We appreciate so much your prayers and your support in the summer season.
[time=1044] It's even more important that we hear from you and we trust that many of you will sit down today and write us.
[time=1051] Let us know you're a part of the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=1054] If we can be of help to you in any way, please let us know.
[time=1057] We'll be happy to do what we can both in praying and in answering the letters and the questions that you write.
[time=1063] In just a moment, we're going to be beginning a series of messages from the 17th chapter of the Gospel of John.
[time=1069] I hope you'll get your Bibles, a piece of paper and a pencil so that you can jot down some notes and stay with us as we share together the Word of God on the Bible hour.
[time=1079] Once again, Bill, thank you for being with us today and for getting us started in the sponsors program and a special word of appreciation to your grandparents and acknowledgement to them on this very special day.
[time=1090] Thank you.
[time=1120] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1177] We have some guests here today and some special people that I want to recognize.
[time=1181] First of all, a number of us gathered down at the Geneva Retreat Center of Friday night in Saturday
[time=1188] for the first annual Men's Retreat and a dear brother from out in the Colorado Rockies came to minister to us
[time=1196] and made himself a part of each man who was there and he was able to stay over and be with us in our service today
[time=1202] and I'd like for Bob Foster to stand if he would.
[time=1205] Bob, we just want you to know we're grateful to have you in our service.
[time=1208] God bless you for being here. Thank you for sharing this time.
[time=1211] And then there are two young people who are going to leave us today and we're going to recognize they're leaving because of the nature of their leaving.
[time=1219] It's always a joy to a pastor's heart when God puts upon the heart of his young people to go out and serve him in a full-time way.
[time=1228] And today is the last service in our midst for Dennis and Kay Yoder who will be leaving this week for Tucson, Arizona
[time=1235] where they will be involved for a year in a ministry of church-related voluntary service.
[time=1242] Denny is going to be involved in building a rehabilitation program for low-income people and Kay will be volunteering in a child abuse center with a sign language opportunity for her in teaching deaf people
[time=1255] and they'll also be involved in a small church as youth directors and will put into operation the evangelism training that they've gotten here at Blackhawk as they direct the visitation ministry of that church.
[time=1266] I'd like for Dennis and Kay to stand if they would so that you could all see them.
[time=1270] Turn around so everyone can see your handsome and pretty faces and remember to pray for Dennis and Kay Yoder in these days ahead as they serve the Lord.
[time=1280] And may their tribe increase. May God raise up many more young couples like that to go out and touch this world for Jesus Christ.
[time=1289] We're going to listen now to our male duo as they come and share with us this number in special music,
[time=1295] Dennis Kirschner and Ron Hackett.
[time=1310] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=1458] Thank you, Dennis and Ron.
[time=1462] All of us who have anything at all to show for our Christian faith can say that that's true.
[time=1468] Whatever there is of beauty in our living is because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=1474] Well, this afternoon we're going to go over to Arlington Park and we've been in preparation all week for a great outdoor service tonight.
[time=1484] We've done everything we can do and the Lord is going to have to cooperate with us in terms of the weather, but the Lord willing will be meeting over there tonight for our evening service.
[time=1496] And we're looking forward to a great time of fellowship just looking into the future in terms of what God has provided for us by way of opportunity for growing in these years ahead.
[time=1508] Somewhere back along we identified the Arlington property as the Promised Land.
[time=1515] I think it was because we were studying the book of Exodus and the life of Moses and we just finished with Joshua's life and so that seems to fit right with all those things we've been talking about.
[time=1525] And we believe God has given it to us in a wonderful way and we are trusting in His Word to provide all those things necessary to see that materialized for us in these days that are before us.
[time=1537] The Black Hawk Singers have reminded us that all of our Christian experience is related to the promise of God.
[time=1545] And in this church we stand upon those promises we have in the past, we're doing it now and we shall in the future.
[time=1552] That's the hope of the Christian experience, the promise of God, and they're going to remind us now about the importance of standing on those promises.
[time=1575] We turn all ages, ladies, praises, green, glory in the highest time we shall have seen, standing on the promises of God, standing on the promises of God, my Savior, standing on the promises of God, my Savior, and me.
[time=1602] I'm standing on the promises of God, standing on the promises that cannot fail, when the hauling storms of doubt and fear a sail, by the living word of God I shall prevail, standing on the promises of God, standing on the promises I cannot fall,
[time=1629] listening every moment to the Spirit's call, resting in my Savior as my holy and all, standing on the promises of God.
[time=1645] And me standing on the promises of God, my Savior, standing on the promises of God, my Savior, standing on the promises of God.
[time=1675] I'm ready to go right now. Amen. Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1687] Open your Bibles this morning to the 17th chapter of the book of John, John chapter 17.
[time=1695] And I want us with our Bibles open to review again these first few verses of this great chapter, John chapter 17.
[time=1708] And this great prayer that is recorded for us from the lips of our Savior, John 17 verses 1 through 8.
[time=1717] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and he said, "Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee,
[time=1729] as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him,
[time=1736] and this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[time=1743] I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do, and now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self,
[time=1753] with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
[time=1757] I have manifested thy name unto the men who now gave us me out of the world, thine they were, and thou gave us them to me,
[time=1765] and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things, whatever thou hast given me, are of thee.
[time=1773] For I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me, and they have received them, and have known surely that I come out from thee,
[time=1781] and they have believed that thou didst send me." Oh God, we come into thy presence today, and we feel as if we are about to enter the holiest of places in the Word of God,
[time=1797] to listen to the words of our blessed Savior as he speaks to his Father.
[time=1803] And we are so grateful as we enter this series of messages that thou in thine own gracious love for us,
[time=1813] have allowed these words to be recorded in the Scriptures, to draw back the curtain as it were,
[time=1821] and let us look into the heart of the Savior, to hear the heartbeat of the one who spent his life upon the cross for us,
[time=1830] to know the things that are important to him so that when we desire to be Christlike,
[time=1836] we can know the things that ought to be important to us.
[time=1839] We pray that you will clear our hearts and our minds from all of those things which would distract our attention,
[time=1846] and cause us, Lord, to hear from heaven during these moments by the Spirit of God who teaches us and illuminates our minds and hearts.
[time=1855] And we would pray, dear God, that if there are those who hear this message, who do not know the one of whom we speak, that this will be the day when they shall come to know him,
[time=1866] whom to know his life eternal.
[time=1869] We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1874] The 17th chapter of John has been called by some the holy of holies of the gospel.
[time=1882] It is referred to as the high priestly prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1889] In all reality, it is the Lord's prayer, that which is so often referred to as the Lord's prayer is more properly termed the disciples prayer.
[time=1899] For the Lord did not pray that prayer, nor could he have.
[time=1903] That prayer asks for forgiveness of sins, and the repayment of debt to those to whom we are debtors,
[time=1909] and the Lord never did pray that prayer.
[time=1912] He taught his disciples to pray that, but that is not the Lord's prayer.
[time=1917] This in the 17th chapter is the Lord's prayer, and it is the most wonderful portion of Scripture recording the words of our Savior that you will find any place in all of the gospels.
[time=1930] As the priest of the Old Testament would enter once a year into the holy of holies to offer a prayer for the people,
[time=1939] before he offered sacrifice for them, so we see Jesus Christ our great high priest entering into the presence of his father into the holy of holies and offering a prayer for us
[time=1952] before he goes to the cross to be the sacrifice for our sins.
[time=1957] It is an interesting thing that though we have many references in the gospels to the Savior's praying,
[time=1963] we have very little of the substance of his prayers.
[time=1967] For instance, the Word of God records that Jesus prayed at his baptism.
[time=1972] Luke chapter 3 verse 21, but it just records it, it does not tell us what he said.
[time=1978] Right after his public ministry was inaugurated, we're told that he rose up a great while before day,
[time=1984] and he went out and departed into a solitary place, and there he prayed.
[time=1989] Mark chapter 1 verse 35, but we don't know what he said.
[time=1993] On the eve of selecting the twelve apostles, the Scripture says he went out into a mountain to pray,
[time=1999] and he continued all night in prayer to God, Luke chapter 6 verse 12.
[time=2005] But though we know he prayed for the disciples, for the apostles, we don't know what he said.
[time=2011] The Scripture tells us in Luke chapter 9 verse 29 that he was in prayer when he was transfigured
[time=2017] on the Mount of Transfiguration, but we do not know what he was saying.
[time=2022] We're told in Luke chapter 23 and verse 49 that the last words he spoke when he continued his words on the cross,
[time=2032] the last words he spoke, he let out his last breath was a prayer to God, and we have just the barest substance of that prayer.
[time=2042] And yet though we know he prayed often, it is only here in the seventeenth chapter
[time=2048] of the book of John that we can look down into his heart and understand what it is that he prays.
[time=2054] Only the briefest mention is made in these other instances of the prayer life of Jesus,
[time=2060] but here in the seventeenth chapter we have a chance to look into his heart and the Holy Spirit has been pleased to record the entire substance of this prayer
[time=2071] so that we might have it and that we might study it and learn from it.
[time=2077] The only real prayer then that we have from the Lord and from his lips is that which we have begun to study today.
[time=2085] And that ought to cause us to want to learn all we can about it, to just take its parts
[time=2091] and involve ourselves in the study of it and see everything that is here for us to see.
[time=2096] It ought to cause a great curiosity to fill our hearts so that we would want more than anything else to know.
[time=2102] What is it that causes the heart of our Savior to burn for his own?
[time=2108] There's another reason why this great study has been impressed upon my heart.
[time=2113] As I mentioned at the outset of our service today for many, many years, I have known the truth that the Lord intercedes for his own in heaven.
[time=2120] Hebrews chapter 7 verse 25 says, "Wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost,
[time=2126] seeing that he ever liveeth to make intercession for them." Hebrews 7, 25. And over in the eighth chapter of the book of Romans we're told these truths.
[time=2137] Who is he that condemneth?
[time=2139] Shall Christ that died? Yea, rather that is risen again? Who is even at the right hand of God?
[time=2146] Who also makeeth intercession for us?
[time=2150] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 24. "For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
[time=2156] which are the figures of the true, but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us.
[time=2165] And in my inquisitive mind I thought, what could the Savior be saying about David Jeremiah
[time=2172] when he prays to the Father?
[time=2175] What could our Lord possibly be thinking about when he prays to the Father about his own?
[time=2181] I thought in terms of the things that I pray for.
[time=2186] And somehow they all seem to be just a bit beneath the dignity of the Savior.
[time=2191] I really couldn't be praying about those things. Sometimes our prayers are so low in their nature.
[time=2197] And as I begin to study the seventeenth chapter of John it's suddenly dawned upon my heart that here is what the Savior prays about when he is at the right hand of the Father.
[time=2207] Here is the motto prayer which in essence continues to live on at the right hand of God
[time=2214] as he opens his heart in our behalf as he mediates for us in the presence of the Almighty God.
[time=2220] As we study the parts of this prayer, all of the requests, the seven petitions and all of the things that are here,
[time=2227] we can rest assured that even as we study in the throne room of glory Jesus Christ is interceding
[time=2234] in these same terms for his own and all that ought to make us want to dig into this prayer
[time=2240] so that we can have an understanding of what's happening in heaven right now.
[time=2245] The prayer for all of us, for you and for me is here recorded in this chapter.
[time=2256] It is interesting to me, I was sharing with Bob Foster this week that he prayed this prayer out loud.
[time=2262] You say how do you know that? Well he prayed it in the presence of his disciples.
[time=2266] That's how it got recorded. He prayed it so others could hear and that's just such a wonderful truth when you contemplate it.
[time=2273] He wanted his disciples to know the place that they had in his affections for them.
[time=2280] He wanted his disciples to hear that he was interested in them and in the continuation of their spiritual lives
[time=2287] after he went back to glory. He wanted them to know so that they would be able to understand at the very core of their being
[time=2295] that Jesus Christ would be using all of his influence as the Son of God to promote the cause of the disciples to the Father.
[time=2305] That does something to me when I think about it today.
[time=2309] A reminder to me that Jesus Christ has recorded this prayer here so that I would understand that in heaven
[time=2316] he is promoting my cause before the Father and he wants me to know that. He wants me to know that he is on my side
[time=2323] and that he cares about my interests. There's a very interesting verse in this chapter that we want to look at by way of introduction
[time=2331] that just teaches that truth so clearly. The thirteenth verse.
[time=2336] Here's what the Savior says to the Father. And now I come to thee. Now listen.
[time=2341] And these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[time=2349] Let me paraphrase that. These are prayers which in heaven I will never cease to make before God.
[time=2357] But I make them now in the world in your hearing so that you will know that I am going to be always promoting your welfare in heaven.
[time=2367] When you know this you will be partakers of my happiness. Isn't that wonderful?
[time=2373] God said I want you to hear the prayer of the Savior so that in listening to that prayer you will understand that from now on in heaven
[time=2382] that's what I'm going to be doing in your behalf. Always promoting your welfare and being concerned about your need and praying these things in your behalf.
[time=2391] Someone has written that this prayer is a standing monument of Christ's affection for his church and it's true.
[time=2402] It is no wonder that the reformer John Knox who turned his world upside down for Christ in his dying days made this request
[time=2411] that every night during his last illness this prayer be read in its entirety in his hearing.
[time=2418] He wanted to be reminded that the Lord who had saved him was the one who would keep him and help him in that time.
[time=2426] And that is the prayer which we are about to study the prayer which Jesus prayed to the Father in behalf of his own.
[time=2435] You say pastor is the prayer being answered. Oh yes it is.
[time=2440] Over in the 11th chapter of John you remember when Jesus was about to pray for the resurrection of Lazarus.
[time=2447] I just thought of these verses this week in response to this prayer if you have your Bibles turned back to the 11th chapter.
[time=2454] John chapter 11 verses 41 and 42.
[time=2458] Jesus is about to pray for Lazarus to come forth from the grave and to announce his resurrection and in verses 41 and 42 we read these words.
[time=2467] Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and he said,
[time=2473] Father I thank thee that thou's heard me and I know that thou heres me always.
[time=2481] Is the prayer being answered?
[time=2485] Jesus said that God always heard his prayer.
[time=2490] So as I study this prayer as I learn what was in the heart of Jesus as he prayed to the Father it is not just so that I can know what was in his heart
[time=2498] but it is so that I might know what is going to transpire in his world because this prayer is being answered today in the lives of his people
[time=2506] and will continue to be answered throughout eternity in the realization of these great and wonderful requests.
[time=2514] Now the prayer in the 17th chapter is easily outlined.
[time=2519] It is easily divided. The outline is found in a verse and maybe this could be a key verse to help you remember how the chapter fits together.
[time=2529] In verse 18 of the chapter there are four pronouns, four words and I want you to see them as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world.
[time=2541] The 18th verse has four words, thou me the world and them and basically those are the four components of the prayer.
[time=2552] Jesus prayed first of all in verses 1 through 5 for himself.
[time=2558] He prayed secondly in verses 6 through 19 for the disciples and he prayed thirdly in verses 20 through 25 for the church throughout all ages which would include us.
[time=2570] Now think about it again, verses 1 through 5 Jesus prays for himself, verses 6 through 19 he prays for his disciples, verses 20 through 25 he prays for the whole church.
[time=2584] In the first section there are two imperatives which form the basis of his prayer.
[time=2590] Those two imperatives in verses 1 through 5 are these verse 1 glorify thy son, verse 5 glorify thou me.
[time=2601] What Jesus prayed for himself as we shall learn in the weeks ahead is that Jesus himself would be glorified again in that position which he had with the Father before he came into the world.
[time=2612] He is coming down to the end of his ministry on this earth and he is praying Lord grant me again that place of glory which I had with the Father in heaven glorify thou me.
[time=2624] In verses 6 through 19 there are two more imperatives which form the basis of the petition in that section as Jesus prayed for his disciples.
[time=2634] Those two imperatives are found in verse 11 and in verse 17, in verse 11 he prays keep them and in verse 17 he prays sanctify them, keep them and sanctify them.
[time=2650] That was his prayer for the disciples who he was about to leave to go back to heaven. He said, "Lord in Father in my heart there are two things that I want for my disciples, keep them.
[time=2661] That has to do with protection from evil and sanctify them. That has to do with perfection of life."
[time=2668] And that was his prayer for his disciples. And when you come to the third section, chapter 17 verses 19 through the end of the chapter we have two petitions, verse 20, "I pray" and verse 24 "I desire."
[time=2686] Another way we could look at these passages of Scripture and to see them in their outlined form by way of introduction in this series of messages is to recognize that in these three sections we have the past, the present and the future of the Christian life.
[time=2702] The request of verses 1 through 8 is the request concerning salvation. Verse 2 says, "I have given them eternal life. That's the present." And verse 14 representing the second section says, "I have given them thy word. That's the present."
[time=2720] And in the third section, verse 22, "I have given them thy glory. That's the future." It's just a reminder to all of us that God in heaven is interested in our past and in our present and in our future.
[time=2735] Now the theme of the 17th chapter of John at the very core is eternal life. And the very centrality of the passage is eternal life as it relates to the Father, as it relates to the disciples, and then in that third concentric circle as it relates to the church of all ages.
[time=2755] And in these moments that remain in this introductory message, it would be good for us if we would talk just a moment about what it is that is at the center of eternal life.
[time=2766] We have a great definition of it in the third verse of this chapter where we are told what eternal life is all about. Here is the definition, and this is eternal life, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
[time=2784] The word no is the word Genosco in the Greek language, and it does not mean just acquaintance, but it means a deep and abiding relationship with a person.
[time=2794] So intimate is that word, that it is the word that is used in the gospels to describe the physical relationship between Joseph and Mary, for it says, "Joseph knew not Mary until the day was brought forth of the Son of Jesus Christ, the Son of God being born."
[time=2813] The word no is an intimate term, and here it means that eternal life is related to knowing intimately Jesus Christ, not just knowing about Him, not just knowing that He exists, but knowing Him intimately in that which we call salvation, when we come to know Christ, that's what eternal life is.
[time=2831] Eternal life is not a massing facts and getting a catechism together. Eternal life is not belonging to some church or having a denominational label that you hide in, but eternal life according to the scripture is a personal, vital relationship with Jesus Christ who is the Son of God.
[time=2849] The question is not do you have eternal life, but it is do you have Jesus Christ for He that hath the Son, hath life, and getting eternal life and getting Jesus Christ are just two different ways of expressing the very same thing, for when you get Jesus Christ, you get eternal life.
[time=2869] And may I say to you that this eternal life is that which answers the quest of every philosopher, it is at the end of the search of every scientist, it is the true meaning in life, it is that for which everyone is searching today, and it's right at their hands if they would just reach out and accept it.
[time=2887] As I read this chapter over and again in preparation for this introductory message, I could not help but sense that throughout the chapter are the truths of eternal life as they touch the deepest needs of mankind.
[time=2902] Here in this chapter we see eternal life as it touches man at the point of his greatest need. Psychologists have said to us that there are certain things which cause people to be healthy and to be properly related to those around him, certain deep seated needs which must be met.
[time=2920] We look around at our society today and we see men and women seemingly on an endless search for some kind of meaningful existence in this world. They've tried everything and can't find it.
[time=2931] But the Bible says that eternal life in Jesus Christ is the answer to that search. Notice with me first of all that the eternal life is the answer for someone who is looking for something to believe in.
[time=2944] Here in this chapter we are told that one of the gifts of God and Christ to his church is his word.
[time=2951] Over in the sixth chapter of John in verse 63, Jesus said to his disciples, "The words I have spoken, they are spirit and they are life."
[time=2962] And I want you to notice in the eighth verse of the seventeenth chapter that these words are the very words which his disciples have believed in.
[time=2971] Verse eight says, "I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me." Notice they received them. They have known them and they have believed them.
[time=2981] All around us today are men and women who are looking for something to believe in. And I want to say that the something they're looking for is the someone of this chapter.
[time=2990] Jesus Christ and he has not just given us a vague description of his personality, but he has given to us a revelation that is very, very pointed in terms of his relationship to us and ours to him.
[time=3004] It tells us what to believe in. Men and women who are looking for something to believe in need to know that this book and the words which God has given to Christ which he has given to us, that's what's worth believing in.
[time=3016] The second thing that eternal life does for us today is he gives us a sense of security.
[time=3022] All around us people seem to be in fear. Will there be enough energy? What if there is an explosion that's not planned for?
[time=3030] What if the nuclear accident that just happened continues to happen in other places?
[time=3036] Jesus Christ is given to us in our eternal life a sense of security versus 11 and 12. There are two words in those two verses kept and guarded.
[time=3047] Though they're translated by the same English word, they're two different words. And those words mean that we are in the center of God's protective care.
[time=3056] He keeps us. He guards us. And though these words may not be clearly understood at this point until we get to that part of our series, mark it down in your book that one of the things you get when you get Jesus Christ in eternal life is the sense of security.
[time=3074] If we are in the hands of Christ and His hand is in the hand of the Father who can separate us from the love of God, we are secure in Him.
[time=3084] Because we are in Him, we are just as safe as if we were in the very physical presence of God and His Father Jesus Christ.
[time=3093] I hasten on to say that part of eternal life that is so wonderfully portrayed here is the fact also that we get satisfaction in living.
[time=3103] Oh, you know people are looking for something that satisfies. They can find a momentary time of happiness.
[time=3109] And the Bible does say that sin is a pleasure for a season.
[time=3113] Somehow when you wake up the morning after something's different and that which you thought was going to bring joy hasn't brought it.
[time=3120] And you've got that empty, aching feeling in your heart.
[time=3124] Jesus here prays to the Father concerning that matter. He says in verse 13, "And now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world."
[time=3132] That they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[time=3137] One of the things you get when you get eternal life is the kind of joy that Jesus has.
[time=3143] Jesus' joy if you want to use that term.
[time=3146] The kind of joy that belongs to Him alone, when you get Him you get His satisfaction with life.
[time=3152] And I like the word "my" in this passage.
[time=3155] My joy, not just a joy, but the joy that belongs to Jesus. That's a part of your possession when you receive eternal life.
[time=3166] It's not related to circumstances. It's not related to environment.
[time=3171] Has nothing whatsoever to gain or lose by whether there's enough energy or not.
[time=3175] It's related to the person of Jesus Christ and He changes not.
[time=3180] When your joy is found in Him you can walk into the most difficult of circumstances and be at peace with yourself and with your maker.
[time=3187] When you get eternal life you get something to believe in.
[time=3191] When you get eternal life you get security in your own person. You get satisfaction in living.
[time=3197] Oh, there's so many other things I wish I could share with you out of this passage that are yours when you get eternal life.
[time=3205] Service to others, a sense of growing, being on the growing edge.
[time=3210] Being a part of something that's worldwide in its outreach, the Church of God, being a part of that great unity.
[time=3219] Serving others in the great commission it says here as I have sent you into the world so I send them.
[time=3225] As Jesus was sent by the Father Jesus now sends us into the world with the message of His person.
[time=3232] The wonderful gift of eternal life.
[time=3236] I met a man a week ago who was ready to end his life.
[time=3241] He said I don't have any reason to live anymore.
[time=3245] Everything that I have tried has failed and I can't even be a success at failing.
[time=3252] And I had the joy of sharing with him that in the person of Jesus Christ there was the answer to the deepest needs of his life.
[time=3259] He could know eternal life whom which is found in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3266] And that which would meet his need will meet your need and yours and yours and wherever you might be in your situation.
[time=3274] Jesus wants to meet that need in your life.
[time=3276] When you get the Son you get life and that life is in totality.
[time=3282] It touches every fiber of your being.
[time=3285] Shall we pray together?
[time=3288] Father we've just scratched the surface of this great truth that God in heaven is hearing the prayer of Christ at His right hand for each of us.
[time=3304] We're so grateful to be on His prayer list.
[time=3308] We sense that today there may be some among us who are not.
[time=3313] For these requests are requests of the Savior for His own.
[time=3320] He does not record here that He prays for those outside of His family.
[time=3324] They're requests for His own.
[time=3327] Lord today there might be some in this auditorium who would understand what a tremendous resource it would be if they could know that Jesus Christ in heaven
[time=3340] was on their side praying for them, caring for their needs.
[time=3345] May there be some we pray in these closing moments who reach out to receive the gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=3355] Cause that they will sense their need.
[time=3359] The need of something to believe in, better yet someone to believe in.
[time=3367] Lord meet them at the point of their need we pray whether they be here in this auditorium or hearing this message out through television.
[time=3374] May they come by faith to trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[time=3380] Confess their sin, receive His wonderful forgiveness, and go forward to serve Him as a new creation.
[time=3389] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
