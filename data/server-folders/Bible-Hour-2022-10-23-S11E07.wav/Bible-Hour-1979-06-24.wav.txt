[time=0] And since my soul, I say God to me, I'll bring you home.
[time=12] I'll bring you home.
[time=22] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=29] And we welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, all of you who are sharing it here in the auditorium, and our many friends who join us now by television in the Fort Wayne area, and in Indianapolis and South Bend, Chicago, and now in Peoria, Illinois, and out in Redwood, California.
[time=49] We're grateful for the opportunity of sharing this service with you, and we trust it'll be a blessing to you as you listen and participate in your own heart with the Ministry of the Word of God.
[time=59] I'm happy to share with you that my favorite preacher is here to speak today.
[time=65] He is my father, and I promised him I would say that.
[time=69] Without being facetious, I really mean that he has--
[time=78] I've heard him preach more than any man in the world.
[time=81] All the days of my life growing up as a pastor's son, and it's just a real thrill for me to have him here today.
[time=88] I have to be honest and admit that I wanted him here on Father's Day, but I waited too long to ask him, and he was already scheduled.
[time=95] So he promised to come the week after.
[time=97] And I'm grateful that he's here, and he's going to be speaking to us in a few moments.
[time=101] Right now, we're going to listen to the Ministry of our Choir, and the Choir is both excited and tired.
[time=108] They got home at one o'clock this morning from a recording session in Alexandria where they completed the recording of a new Choir album that will be released next week.
[time=119] And I have been asked to say to the Choir that during the time they're singing, we want to see the reds of their eyes.
[time=126] And they promised not to go to sleep, even though they were up late.
[time=129] They're going to minister to us in music, and they're directed by our Minister of Music, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=135] [MUSIC]
[time=141] I will not have you to be read, read, read, read.
[time=147] Concerning them nature asleep, that it's all not me.
[time=154] And as all this rich can know all,
[time=160] for if we believe that Jesus started souls again,
[time=166] even so their most holy than Jesus, we'll God be with Him.
[time=173] We'll God be with Him.
[time=176] For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
[time=187] that we with your own, and we may unto the coming of the Lord.
[time=197] Shall not we see them, with our own sleep.
[time=202] For the Lord, it tells shall be sent from filled with the child,
[time=216] with the voice of the Lord, King John, and with the child of God.
[time=227] And the daily in Christ shall rise first.
[time=237] There we make sure and light, and we may shall be called up
[time=246] to fill with Him in the falls, to give the Lord in the end.
[time=257] And shall shall we ever be with the Lord.
[time=263] So shall we ever be with the Lord, forever be with Him.
[time=276] And that song coming to us from the New Testament
[time=294] scriptures about the return of Christ reminds us of the great and glorious hope that we have as believers.
[time=302] Last week we had the master's touch from Western Baptist Bible College here, directed by Mr. Kobe, who was with us just a year ago, as a part of our staff.
[time=312] And one of the things that Pete did when he was here was to establish the Sounds Alive singing group.
[time=318] They are not together anymore, not touring the country, but some of the members of that group, our members of our church, and have been a real blessing to us musically.
[time=326] One of those people is Marilyn Wong, who has blessed our hearts many times with her vocal ministry.
[time=332] She comes to minister to us now.
[time=334] Please listen as she shares musically.
[time=362] My life was out of tune and happiness eluded me.
[time=376] My life was dissonant and missing in her harmony.
[time=383] But then I met the Savior and saw His matchless face.
[time=390] And now my heart sings melody.
[time=394] Jesus is my music.
[time=405] Jesus is my song.
[time=412] Jesus is my music.
[time=420] I want to sing His praises all day long.
[time=428] Jesus is my music.
[time=434] Jesus is my song.
[time=441] Jesus is my music.
[time=450] I want to sing His praises all day long.
[time=480] I played with earthly toys and happiness frustrated me.
[time=492] My life was just a noise and missing sensitivity.
[time=499] But then I met the Savior and saw His matchless face.
[time=506] And now my life is a symphony.
[time=514] Jesus is my music.
[time=521] Jesus is my song.
[time=529] Jesus is my music.
[time=536] I want to sing His praises all day long.
[time=543] Jesus is my music.
[time=551] Jesus is my song.
[time=558] Jesus is my music.
[time=566] I want to sing His praises all day long.
[time=578] Thank you for sharing the Bible Hour today.
[time=605] Jesus is a very special program for me because of the opportunity we have to have my father,
[time=611] Dr. James D. Jeremiah here to share the Word of God and he's going to be doing that in just a few moments.
[time=616] Right now while we have these few moments of informality, Don and I want to talk with you about two very special items that relate to the support and the ongoing ministry of
[time=627] the Bible Hour.
[time=628] First of all, I think we need to give them an update on the sponsors program.
[time=631] Don, I want to share just a bit of what that's all about and how it works and how people
[time=637] can get involved in being a sponsor of the Bible Hour Telecast.
[time=641] The sponsors program was devised in order that we might receive a number of larger gifts
[time=649] to help in the support of the ministry.
[time=652] Many times we receive smaller gifts from the people who watch and they are a great encouragement to us and we do need the smaller gifts, but without a larger gift now and that it really is difficult to stay on top financially and so we are asking people who are interested in the Bible Hour if they would like to sponsor the Bible Hour for one Sunday in their particular
[time=673] area and this costs the neighborhood of four or five hundred dollars.
[time=677] I recognize that there are many people who can't do that as you've already said.
[time=681] Many of our older friends, some of them on retirement and social security and we understand that that would be an impossibility for them and yet it's exciting to know that there are businessmen, there are corporations, there are people who have the ability to do that who believe in the Bible Hour and little by little here and there we're hearing from these people from around the Bible Hour network who are excited about being involved as a sponsor of the Bible Hour Telecast and Donna, when they do that, we like to share on this part of our program that they're sponsoring the Bible Hour.
[time=711] We've even had one sponsor on the air with us and in a couple of weeks we're going to have another one here but we also send them a very special remembrance of their commitment
[time=721] of preaching the gospel in their area on a given Sunday.
[time=724] Yes, we have a lovely engraved plaque that states that they have sponsored the Bible
[time=730] Hour in their area on a particular date perhaps in honor of someone or in memory of someone
[time=736] and that it has the Bible Hour signature at the bottom.
[time=739] We also have developed a plan whereby a person can be an associate sponsor and that means
[time=745] that by giving a lesser amount they too can be included in this program and though we aren't going to go into detail about that on today's telecast we'll be talking about that in the future.
[time=755] If you'd like to be an associate sponsor and could give as much as $100 toward the cost of the telecast in your area, if you'll write to us we'll be happy to communicate to you and share with you how that works.
[time=766] Obviously if the Bible Hour telecast is going to grow and expand and if we're going to reach out into the mission field as we have opportunity in the Philippine Islands and some of the other areas here in the Midwest that are asking for our program it's going to be necessary for us to develop a group of friends who will substantially get behind the Bible Hour and help us as we preach the gospel each Sunday.
[time=787] We believe that there's a tremendous need for Bible oriented ministries on the air, not
[time=793] issue oriented, not opinionated but the exposition of the Word of God from God's Word to the
[time=799] hearts of the people who watch and we know we have many friends who believe that too.
[time=804] If you'd like to be a part of the sponsors program we hope you'll write to us this week and how do they do that honey?
[time=810] You just need to jot a note to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 1504 Wayne, Indiana
[time=818] 46815 just share with us that you would like to have a part in the sponsors program.
[time=824] Donna over the past few weeks we have been offering a special gift and we have had many
[time=830] offers that have been on the air that one has been a very special one the four gospels but today we want to introduce a new gift item that we'd like to have you write to us for.
[time=841] It's a special book on the home written by my father Dr. James T. Jeremiah and it has
[time=847] to do with the principles of the Christian home which operated in the home in which I grew up in fact the book is dedicated to the four children of the Jeremiah family of which
[time=858] I am one and it has some exciting principles to share with our friends at home on how a
[time=864] Christian home ought to operate it's written right out of the warp and woof of the Jeremiah family and it's a very exciting little booklet to me because I can remember some of the principles being in operation that are written about in this book we'd like to send this book into the homes of our friends because it communicates some very specific and exciting topics I know
[time=884] you have a copy of the book in your hand why don't you share with our friends at home some of the things that they'll find when they open the pages of this book.
[time=893] Listed in the table of contents are the chapters and one of them is wedded in his will and
[time=900] roles by the rules praying parents and interesting chapter on a paddle with love and they're
[time=908] just numerous other ones that are really helpful in raising a family these days.
[time=914] Donna the chapters deal with the topics that are most current among those who are discussing the family and as I thought about the message I preached last week on the importance of being a father who has time for his children I thought this would be a very special follow up to that message and especially because dad is here today we'd like to make this booklet available to you as our gift today it's a way of extending the ministry of the Bible hour into your home and it comes to you free and postage paid by your request.
[time=942] If you can't enclose a gift of course we appreciate that but I want you to know that if you cannot do that this is our way of saying thank you to you for being a part of our congregation
[time=952] today and we'll be happy to send this booklet into your home this week.
[time=956] Now in order to get your free copy of the home that stands I want you to sit down right now and write down this address right to me pastor David Jeremiah post office box one five two
[time=967] five oh Fort Wayne Indiana forty six eight one five once again that's pastor David Jeremiah

[time=980] the end of this telecast but please write it down and don't forget to write to us this week and request your copy of this free book.

Jeremiah and we trust that God will minister to your heart as we share together the Bible hour on today's telecast before we go back to the service Donna give them the address one more time so they won't forget okay that address is pastor David Jeremiah post office box one five two five oh Fort Wayne.
[time=1042] [MUSIC]
[time=1072] thank you that was beautiful and you may be seated we're going to listen now to Ron
[time=1101] Hackett as he comes and ministers in music to our hearts Ron
[time=1114] the heavens penises spender field and bright came a key and he came to bring to the one who life and life and life.
[time=1142] What grace is this that brought my Savior down that made him leave his glorious throne and crown.
[time=1156] the one who put the earth a sky and sea who put the stars in every galaxy.
[time=1170] What condescension or how can it be.
[time=1177] What shame is suffered or what agony and then the death he died for sinners crucified.
[time=1191] What grace is this.
[time=1203] What shame is suffered or what agony and then the death he died for sinners crucified.
[time=1227] What grace is this.
[time=1245] Thank you Ron that's a wonderful John W. Peterson song what grace is this and we all of us are Christians know that grace
[time=1256] is the foundation of our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1260] The Black Hawk singers are going to come and sing before the message a song that carries with it the impact of the great commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel.
[time=1271] It is a very fitting song for us to share before the message from my father because of all the things that I can say about my dad he has a heart and compassion for evangelism that somehow was filtered into my own life
[time=1285] and I'm grateful that they've chosen to sing this song reminding us of the fact that as Christians we are indeed under orders.
[time=1315] How do we talk to the deaf ears?
[time=1325] What can we show to the blind in our eyes?
[time=1337] Can we teach the speeches to sing a song and help all the lame ones to walk in the light?
[time=1360] He said go He into all of the world teaching that precious name sweet love and grace proclaim not just here or there but tell him everywhere.
[time=1389] Go He into all of the world.
[time=1405] My hands are a voice to the deaf ears.
[time=1415] His words paint a picture for blind eyes to see.
[time=1425] The heart sings sweet music our lips can speak.
[time=1434] Lord fill me with such love the weak lean on me.
[time=1445] He said go He into all of the world teaching that precious name sweet love and grace proclaim not just here or there but tell him everywhere.
[time=1474] Go He into all of the world.
[time=1504] Thank you Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1508] In 1953 we were living as a family in Dayton, Ohio where my dad was the pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist Church.
[time=1518] During that time he was functioning as the vice president of Cedarville College, a school that had taken over a campus of 15 acres in a little town called Cedarville not too far away from Springfield, Ohio.
[time=1532] God spoke to his heart as he was challenged by the trustees of that school to come and be the full time president of Cedarville College.
[time=1540] For a little time perspective I was in the seventh grade when that happened.
[time=1545] We moved from Dayton, Ohio to Cedarville and there were 90 students in the school that first year.
[time=1552] That was 25 years ago and my father has been the president of Cedarville College from 1953 until 1978 when he became the chancellor of the school and during his time the school grew from 90 students to its president attendance of over 1200 students.
[time=1571] God has wonderfully blessed the school. I am doubly blessed because of the opportunity I had to live in that town and to grow up there under the umbrella of the school's influence.
[time=1583] I got my education there. I met my wife at Cedarville College. All of us who are in the Jeremiah family graduated from that school and so we have a great heritage of which we're very proud.
[time=1595] My father now is supposed to be in retirement though he doesn't say that. He's working harder it seems to me than he ever has traveling all over the country speaking in Bible conference ministries and it's just a real privilege for us to have him here today to share the word of God.
[time=1609] I often have teased him that someday I would introduce him as your friend and my father. Here he is. Thank you David. I'm sure that all of you can understand something of the thrill, the blessing in our hearts that is the hearts of my wife and me in coming to this church and having a part in this ministry.
[time=1632] God has been good to us in giving us four children, all of them knowing the Lord of Savior and all involved in being witnesses for Christ.
[time=1642] I think of all the things that have happened to us, all the things the Lord's been pleased to do, there's nothing quite like that to know that these young people are saved.
[time=1651] I'm now serving as Chancellor of Cedarville College, somebody asked me what that is, I said I really don't know. I guess after 25 years the trustees decided to take a chance with me and let me run around the country.
[time=1665] And we've been doing that. We've had Bible conferences in many places and since I was last here my wife and I had the privilege of going around the world, visiting some of the mission stations, having a ministry to the missionaries and having a great time serving the Lord.
[time=1680] One of the thrills that we have of course is to pray for and observe what God's doing at Black Hawk Baptist Church, what he's doing through the Bible hour.
[time=1691] There are many churches in the land and we're of course concerned about all of them but this has a very special place in our hearts and it's a thrill to see what God is doing and winning people to Christ and seeing the advancement and the new building projects that are ahead
[time=1707] and the expansion of the television ministry and we're just so happy to be a part of it today and I trust our few minutes of ministry may be a challenge and a help and encouragement to you as you listen to the Word of God.
[time=1723] Will you open your Bibles please to 2 Peter chapter 1 and I would like to read for our Bible study verses 1 through 11 and our message will be based upon this particular scripture.
[time=1740] 2 Peter chapter 1, Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ, grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.
[time=1760] According as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through us.
[time=1782] And beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity.
[time=1799] For if these things be in you in a bound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see you far off and the forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
[time=1816] Therefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1831] Shall we pray together our father we pray that you will take the word of God today and make it live in the hearts of all of us who speak it and who hear it make us to be obedient to what it says honoring the Lord Jesus Christ in receiving him as Savior and living him living for him as Lord.
[time=1849] May his spirit deal with our hearts today in Jesus name Amen.
[time=1854] We are living in great days. I'm glad God let me live today and this time I heard the choir sing this morning about the blessed hope and my heart was thrilled as I listened.
[time=1865] And then I was reminded again of this passage of scripture as it prepares us for what's coming to pass upon this earth.
[time=1872] Living in a great day many problems of course any things that bring heartache to many prophetic scriptures remind us that in the last days difficult times will come.
[time=1883] And Paul also writing to Timothy in another place said in the latter time some shall fall away from the faith paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.
[time=1894] I believe we're living in the last days. I do not set any dates for the coming of Christ. I believe he can come today. I believe he may.
[time=1905] But we're living in a day when trouble is in the world. Everywhere you look, international distress, terrorism, famines, catastrophes, inhuman treatment to other people, immorality, murder, including great emphasis these days on abortion,
[time=1921] shortages of energy, inflation, name it, we have it. How can we live in a day like this? Well over and over again in this wonderful book called the Bible there are promises abundant to tell us that it's all together possible.
[time=1936] Early in my Christian life I remember very distinctly the promise of a verse in the Old Testament Psalm 8411 for the Lord God is a sun and shield.
[time=1946] The Lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. That was a great encouragement to me then and it still is.
[time=1955] We read on in the book of Romans that he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things.
[time=1964] And on and on through the scriptures we have the promises that show us there is enough for times like these.
[time=1971] Now the Apostle Peter in writing this last book outlines chapter one how to be prepared for those times. In chapter two he tells us something about the times we are to expect.
[time=1985] For as we just take a brief glance at that chapter he starts out by talking about false prophets, false teachers who deny the Lord that bought them.
[time=1994] He speaks about covetousness, about the wicked, about those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness.
[time=2001] Pretty well describes the day in which we live, how can we face a day like that? Someone has pointed out that Peter in writing his first letter reminds us of the fact that he is taking us through the wilderness as the children of Israel were brought out of the land of Egypt.
[time=2017] When he comes to the second letter he takes us into the land, into the land of promise reminding us how we might be able to live.
[time=2025] Well you notice in verse three the text that outlines this passage of scripture where the Apostle says he is given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.
[time=2038] He starts out by saying in the letter that grace is to be multiplied unto us.
[time=2043] And so the grace of God is sufficient for all that's necessary to live a life of godliness in a day like this.
[time=2054] No one of us has any reason to believe.
[time=2057] We have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior that we can live our lives by ourselves or that we can succeed by what we do.
[time=2066] But we have every reason to believe that there is sufficient grace for every aspect of the Christian life and we have all we need.
[time=2074] We have enough for times like these.
[time=2077] Let's think about it in three ways this morning as we have opportunity.
[time=2081] Let's think about grace for life and godliness.
[time=2085] Grace for life and godliness.
[time=2087] He speaks in verse one through four about it being multiplied.
[time=2091] About it being given to us.
[time=2093] He's granted or bestowed on us a gift.
[time=2096] And as he comments on this passage concerning grace he talks about the might of his grace.
[time=2102] According as his divine power hath given I don't think we've ever fathomed and perhaps in this life we never shall understand completely.
[time=2110] All that has been given and bestowed upon those who trust the Lord by his grace.
[time=2116] Not only unmerited favor to us, but favor to us when just the opposite was deserved.
[time=2122] We deserved hell and damnation and condemnation.
[time=2125] But in his grace by his might according to his divine power he has given to us all things that are necessary for life and godliness in a day of ungodliness like this.
[time=2138] He also speaks of the means of his grace by the exceeding great and precious promises.
[time=2144] There are a number of things in Peter's writings that you'll want to study that he classifies his precious.
[time=2150] There are precious trials and precious blood and precious promises.
[time=2154] And here he talks about the word of God which is the means of grace.
[time=2158] Now in our day there are many people who think the means of grace can be a church or a sacrament or the clergy
[time=2164] or a lot of things that people do or get through religion.
[time=2167] The Bible makes it clear that grace becomes ours through the word of God.
[time=2171] The exceeding great and precious promises which he has given unto us.
[time=2176] The only thing that God is pleased to use to bring us to life is the word of God.
[time=2182] The Holy Spirit has given it, inspired it, the Holy Spirit has promised to use it.
[time=2187] And here he talks about the exceeding great and precious promises which he has given unto us.
[time=2192] Throughout Peter's writings he refers to the word of God as the means of grace.
[time=2196] The means by which God's grace becomes a communicated blessing from heaven to your soul in mind.
[time=2203] The might of grace, the great power of God, the means of grace, his word, his word, then the miracle of grace.
[time=2211] We are partakers of the divine nature.
[time=2213] We become inheritors, we become partakers.
[time=2217] He has delivered us from all the corruption in the world.
[time=2221] That is, we never have to face the judgment of it.
[time=2224] And there is power in his grace to live above it.
[time=2227] You read all about the signs of the times and the trend of the ages and read your newspaper and see your television set with all the news.
[time=2236] And then take a look at God's word and you can realize from the promises of this passage of Scripture that God has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness through his grace.
[time=2247] A matter of simple faith.
[time=2249] Dr. Beaterwolf, a man who lived some years ago, W. Beaterwolf wrote a book on the resurrection.
[time=2255] In this book he tells about a man who tried to really trip up a Christian who hadn't had very much opportunity
[time=2265] of formal education, but he had become acquainted with the Lord Jesus Christ in his grace.
[time=2271] And this man began to ridicule him because the Christian believed in a bodily resurrection.
[time=2277] And finally he said to him, "You said it's common fact that most of our body is made up of phosphorus."
[time=2285] I think he was taking for granted.
[time=2287] And he said, "There's going to be a resurrection someday and everybody knows there's not enough phosphorus for everybody's body."
[time=2295] And so this young Christian looked at him and said, "Well, don't worry about that, don't worry about that at all." He said, "Bible says in the Scriptures it makes it very clear that the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=2309] And I'm in Christ, along with a few others, many others, and the dead in Christ will get their share of the phosphorus,
[time=2316] and you can search for your own." Well, you may laugh at that and say, "Well, that's a pretty simple answer. That's a good answer." Here is a man who believed God. He believed what God had said about life and the resurrection.
[time=2330] And he took it for granted that because God said it, he'd do it.
[time=2334] And that's the way you become a partaker of the divine nature through the grace that God has given.
[time=2339] And when he gives that, he gives all that's necessary. He gives enough for life and godliness.
[time=2345] Now, there's more to the Christian life than that.
[time=2347] For the next portion of that Scripture deals with growth in life and godliness. He uses the word "ad."
[time=2355] It's interesting in the Bible study how little words in the English take big words in the original to make us understand what the little words mean.
[time=2364] This word, as I have been told, comes from a word that has to do with supplying or bearing the expense of a great chorus for public hearing of a great chorus.
[time=2376] And as you read this, you sort of get the idea that when you add and prepare for this addition that God has made it possible in our believing lives as Christians,
[time=2386] that we can have a chorus of our own as we add and prepare for this kind of a life.
[time=2392] Notice he deals with persistence, giving all diligence, add to your faith.
[time=2397] That means make an intense effort to do it. That means to make it your business. Nothing happens without it.
[time=2405] Notice the progress in the Christian life is described here in verses 5 to 7.
[time=2410] Develop one virtue in the exercise of another, character, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, love.
[time=2419] All of this has to do with growth in the Christian life.
[time=2423] You see, God has not only given us enough for grace in saving us, but there is enough for life in godliness in growth.
[time=2431] And if you're a Christian and you're the same spiritual age so far as your growth is concerned, now as you were when you were saved,
[time=2439] you better my friend start looking and finding out why because the vital signs of life in the spiritual life indicates that growth is a reality.
[time=2448] It speaks of productiveness in verse 8. We are not to be idled nor unfruitful.
[time=2453] One who grows in grace will be serving, and he will have fruit of the Spirit as he continues to grow in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2463] I was reminded not so long ago of a superintendent in a school who came to the superintendent of the schools of that section.
[time=2470] This perhaps a man who had been concerned very much about his promotion, one of his friends was promoted and he wasn't.
[time=2478] He was very much disturbed and so he went to the superintendent of schools and he said, "I don't understand why I have been promoted.
[time=2485] I've had 25 years of experience and you overlook me." Superintendent looked at him and said, "No, you have not had 25 years of experience.
[time=2495] You simply had one year experience 25 times." And sometimes I think in our Christian life, we're like that.
[time=2503] We go through life with the same old thing happening. We never see any new territory. Nothing ever happens.
[time=2508] We have 25 years of experience, one year, one year, and so on.
[time=2513] The idea is to be productive in our Christian lives.
[time=2516] And then notice the idea in verse 9 to be perceptive.
[time=2520] But he that lack of these things is blind. He that has them can see is the converse, the opposite side of that.
[time=2527] And he cannot see you far off, but if he has these things he can see you far off. We have perception.
[time=2533] Stunted saints see things only in the present and the temporal.
[time=2537] We can only see now and we don't do very well at that.
[time=2540] We don't see beyond what God has provided for us in eternity.
[time=2544] And sometimes we don't see what God has provided for us in the present as opportunities and challenges and a way to reach out and touch the lives of others.
[time=2553] Growing Christians are Christians with vision. And vision is necessary if we're going to go any place for God.
[time=2560] And growth is a part of the Christian life just as much as the grace of God is in giving it.
[time=2567] I like the attitude expressed by a story relating to a philosopher.
[time=2572] I guess there are a lot of things about philosophers and preachers that are in common. I'm not sure exactly what, but anyway one so goes the story young man came to Socrates.
[time=2583] And he said to the old philosopher, "I have come 1500 miles to learn from you how to have knowledge and wisdom."
[time=2591] And the philosopher looked at this young man, took him by the hand, let him down to the seashore not so far from Athens.
[time=2598] Let him out in the water until he was waist deep in the water.
[time=2602] Then without saying anything he took hold of the back of his head, pushed his head under the water and held him there.
[time=2608] And held him there. The fellow struggled, struggled.
[time=2613] And when Socrates discovered that he'd struggled about the end of the struggle, he raised him out of the water, hauled him to the shore.
[time=2621] They'd him quietly down in the sand when often left him. Pretty rough treatment you say, but that was a philosopher, not a preacher did that.
[time=2630] And when on his way to teach, and finally the young man revives sufficiently, came down to the agora, the marketplace where he was teaching, ask him why he'd done that.
[time=2640] The philosopher said to him, "Young man, when your head was under the water, what did you think about most?
[time=2649] What did you want more than anything in life?" And he said, "Air." He said, "When you want wisdom and knowledge, with the same compassion you wanted air, you won't have to come to me for it.
[time=2666] You'll already have the secret." Well, we can't take Christians out of the seashore and put their heads under the water until they struggle.
[time=2676] And my friend, when you and I want godliness, and a Christ-like life, and a concern about other people, and love that comes only from God, with a passion like that young man wanted wisdom, will grow in grace.
[time=2693] Growth in life and godliness, grace for life and godliness, and then last of all in our minutes today, let's talk about the glory beyond this life and its godly living.
[time=2709] Notice now in verses 10-11, "Wherefore the rather brethren give diligence, to make your calling an election sure, or if you do these things you shall never fall, give diligence, be an earnest to make certain."
[time=2726] Not all professing Christians are Christians, did you know that?
[time=2730] The word of God gives us one of the most shocking passages of Scripture in Matthew 7 that we could find anyplace.
[time=2738] The Lord Jesus is speaking, and He tells us in Matthew 7, 21-23, many will say, many will say in that day when they stand before Him in the future.
[time=2749] Many will say, "Have we not prophesied in thy name?
[time=2754] Have we not cast out demons in thy name?
[time=2757] Haven't we done many wonderful works in thy name?" There are a lot of people today that talk about their profession.
[time=2766] The Lord Jesus says, "In that day I will say I never knew you, depart from me that work iniquity."
[time=2776] It takes more than joining a church, being baptized, being a member of a religious order of some kind, and even doing religious work.
[time=2788] When we think about the grace for life and godliness and the consequent growth that comes because of grace, we need to think about the fact that one day we're going to meet God.
[time=2801] And this passage of Scripture tells us that we can have an assured experience on earth now.
[time=2808] Don't have to wait until we die.
[time=2810] In fact, the matter is, my friend, if we don't have the assurance now, it probably won't happen in that hour of death.
[time=2818] He said, "Make your calling election sure." What's that mean?
[time=2822] It simply means make sure you're saved, make sure of that.
[time=2826] How can you know?
[time=2828] Well, the wherefore in that text points back to what we've just been discussing.
[time=2833] The apostle Peter's been talking about the growth that comes in life and godliness.
[time=2838] And there's enough grace that we might grow in life and godliness.
[time=2841] Wherefore, make your calling election sure.
[time=2845] We go back and see what's happening.
[time=2847] It isn't likely that a Christian who isn't growing is very sure about being saved.
[time=2852] But one who has grown and is growing and is going on for God is sure about it.
[time=2857] Wherefore, make your calling and election sure, an obedient life leads to an assured heart.
[time=2863] No one can be sure of salvation if he is a spiritually lazy or disobedient Christian
[time=2869] who goes on without having any concept of what the life is all about.
[time=2874] Now we can have an assured experience on earth.
[time=2877] I'm glad for that.
[time=2879] I've dealt with many people in my life who'd come and say, "I'm not sure I'm a Christian.
[time=2883] I made a profession, but I'm not sure." And I was delighted to take them to the Bible, especially to the Epistle of John, where the writer talks about knowing.
[time=2893] 27 times in the first Epistle of John, the word "know" is used.
[time=2898] "I may know I'm saved." What a glorious truth it is to have in our hearts.
[time=2903] But then he talks about an entrance, "shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom."
[time=2912] That is more than just making it, my friend, to have an abundant entrance into the kingdom,
[time=2919] into heaven, if you please.
[time=2922] When a victor in the Olympic Games would come home from the races,
[time=2928] they had a special, glorious reception.
[time=2931] He didn't go into the ordinary gate.
[time=2933] They made a gate in the wall.
[time=2935] He had an abundant entrance.
[time=2937] But I'm not sure altogether what will happen in that day when the child of God meets the Lord and the rapture of the saints.
[time=2944] Or when we go to Him in death, I am sure that if we have received the grace that gives us life and godliness,
[time=2953] and we have the growth that consequently comes, what an abundant entrance it will be for us in that day.
[time=2961] The Lord, Giuseppe Bartallo, true to the United States from Italy.
[time=2966] He came to the New York airport, took the bus in the Manhattan, loaded his baggage into a taxi,
[time=2973] and said, "Mongumnery Street, if you please." And so the taxi driver took him to Montgomery Street, got out of the cab, pulled a picture out of his pocket, started walking up and down the streets,
[time=2987] up and down the curbs of Montgomery Street.
[time=2990] It was a picture of a house.
[time=2992] A picture of a house that his son had sent him.
[time=2994] It was his son's home, and he was coming to this country to see his family.
[time=2998] He walked for an hour. He couldn't find it, up and down the sidewalks.
[time=3002] He couldn't find Montgomery Street.
[time=3006] Finally, the taxi cab driver, who had long since forgotten him, I guess, took his luggage to the police station.
[time=3014] And finally, as he showed the picture to somebody, he discovered something.
[time=3019] It was Montgomery Street, all right, but not in Manhattan, in San Francisco.
[time=3027] And the poor man had spent all of that hour, all of that time, trying to find a place he thought was his son's home.
[time=3037] He didn't have a very good reception into this country.
[time=3041] You know why? Because he really didn't know where he was going.
[time=3047] And there may be some of you listening to me this morning, in this auditorium, out in the television audience.
[time=3057] You're religiously oriented, all right.
[time=3061] You've got all kinds of ideas as to what it's going to be like when it's all over.
[time=3066] But you really don't know for sure where you're going.
[time=3070] You haven't made your calling an election sure.
[time=3073] You're walking up and down the streets of life with a self-kind of image of what it's going to be like.
[time=3080] Why don't you take time out of your life just long enough, just long enough to find out what the Word of God has to say about it.
[time=3089] And stop your dreaming, stop your wandering, stop your going through life up and down the streets if you please, without knowing where you're going.
[time=3099] My friend, the Word of God is so clear about this.
[time=3103] Of all the truths of the Scripture that stands out without any question, the Bible tells us very clearly how we can know positively where we're going.
[time=3115] How clear it is to as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.
[time=3125] Beloved, now are we the sons of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, or we shall see him as he is.
[time=3136] Listen, there is enough grace to live a life of godliness, grow in that grace, anticipate the glory that God has provided for us.
[time=3147] I hope you're sure, I pray you shall be, a God grant today, that certainty will be yours, shall we pray.
[time=3156] Shall we bow together in prayer?
[time=3164] Father, we thank you for this challenge from thy word, and we would pray today that if there are those here, those listening at home who have not come to the certainty of their salvation
[time=3176] that today will be the day when their decision will be made.
[time=3180] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed, let me speak first of all to those of you who are watching at home.
[time=3188] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior right now, where you are in your living room, your family room,
[time=3196] you can bow your head and your heart and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to come into your life.
[time=3203] And on the promise of God's word, you can this day be a possessor as well as a professor.
[time=3210] You can know Christ personally.
[time=3213] When you pray, simply pray, Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[time=3217] I know that in my own human effort, I cannot reach up to the high and holy standards of God.
[time=3223] And so today, I confess my sin, and I receive Jesus Christ into my life to be my personal Savior.
[time=3231] You come in and Lord, I accept you today.
[time=3236] And the Lord Jesus Christ has promised that if we ask, He will come into our lives and into our hearts,
[time=3242] and we can be born again and can know Christ personally.
[time=3247] Now here in this auditorium, as we wait just quietly in response to this message,
[time=3253] how many of you here can say, Pastor Dave, I know that I'm a Christian.
[time=3260] The calling and election in my life is sure.
[time=3263] If I were to die today, I'm as sure of going to heaven as if I were already there.
[time=3267] I know that I'm a Christian.
[time=3269] I want you to lift your hand.
[time=3271] Just raise it right up.
[time=3272] I'm positive.
[time=3273] I'm sure I'm a Christian.
[time=3274] Thank you.
[time=3275] You say, preacher, how absurd to think that anyone could be sure.
[time=3279] Well, the Bible says we can, the Bible says we can know, and those who raise their hands, I assume the reason you raised your hand is because you can point back to a time in your life when you bowed in prayer to receive the Lord Jesus, and you ask Him to come into your life.
[time=3293] And because you ask, and He promised, you know that you're a Christian.
[time=3298] There are some of you who couldn't raise your hands, either because you know in your own heart that you've never accepted Christ or because you're unsure.
[time=3307] I wonder how many of the rest of you would say today.
[time=3309] Pastor Jeremiah, I can't say for sure that I'm a Christian.
[time=3314] I don't know what would happen to me for sure if I were to die today.
[time=3318] And I want you to know that I'm concerned about it.
[time=3320] I want to know for certain that I'm a Christian.
[time=3323] Would you pray for me today?
[time=3325] I'm going to ask that you lift your hand, wherever you might be.
[time=3328] I'm not sure that I'm a Christian.
[time=3330] I couldn't lift my hand positively a few moments ago.
[time=3333] But I want you to know I'm concerned about my condition spiritually.
[time=3337] Would you pray for me?
[time=3338] Just lift it up right now, would you?
[time=3340] Up in the balcony, here on the main floor.
[time=3344] Lift it up so that I can see it, and I want to pray with you.
[time=3348] Just now as we wait, God bless you.
[time=3351] Thank you, you may put it down.
[time=3353] Someone else.
[time=3354] Here's my hand, preacher.
[time=3356] I lift it up because I'm not sure.
[time=3359] I may be among those who will be disappointed in that day when I stand before God.
[time=3363] And he says, "Depart from me, I never knew you." You've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah.
