[time=31] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=41] So I say, God, for you, I'll bring you home, I'll bring you home, I'll bring you home.
[time=53] And since my soul, I say, God, for you, I'll bring you home, I'll bring you home.
[time=71] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=83] And this is the Sunday of the July 4th weekend at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=88] We welcome all of you to our midst.
[time=90] Those of you who are worshiping with us here in the auditorium and our many friends who have joined us now by television.
[time=96] This is a very special day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, one that we look forward to in the middle of the summer each year.
[time=102] Our choir presents a very special musical presentation in the evening of the Sunday of July 4th weekend.
[time=111] It is grown to the place where now we must do it twice.
[time=114] And this evening at 5 o'clock and again at 8 o'clock, the Black Hawk Baptist Church Sanctuary Choir
[time=120] will be sharing the music of our country and of our faith.
[time=123] And it will be a glorious time for all of us as this auditorium is packed to the very brim, two times in a row as people from all over this area come to share this occasion with us.
[time=133] Many of the political leaders of this community, some of our state and national representatives
[time=139] will be here tonight, and it will be a great time for us to say the positive things that need to be said about this great land in which we live.
[time=147] And we're going to share just a taste of that this morning as we listen to our choir.
[time=151] And during this first section of music, we'll be hearing the men's singers backed by the
[time=157] sanctuary choir as they sing a very favorite of all patriots, my country, 'Tis of thee.
[time=165] My country, 'Tis of thee, sweet land of liberty,
[time=191] of thee I see.
[time=196] And where my father's died, when of a pilgrim's pride, from every mountain's sight, let freedom ring.
[time=221] Let music swell the breeze and ring from all the trees,
[time=231] sweet freedom soar.
[time=236] Let vital tongues awake, let all that breathe partake, let boxes silence break,
[time=251] let a song prolong.
[time=268] Our fathers have to be the mother of liberty, to thee we sing.
[time=282] Now we are land we bright, with freedom's holy light.
[time=297] We're going to ask the men's singers to stay here and be joined by the rest of the Black
[time=319] Hawk Singers as they come to share with us a message that really communicates the only real hope we have as a nation and that is that God's people get back to their knees in behalf
[time=330] of their country.
[time=331] It says in the Old Testament that if the people of God will pray and seek the face of God,
[time=337] that he will hear from heaven and he will heal the land.
[time=341] Though that's a promise directed to the Old Testament people of Israel, it is a principle that applies to us today.
[time=348] We have been reading much recently about the number of Christians there are in America, and many people are born again.
[time=355] And I believe with all of my heart that if God's people who salt this earth and this country
[time=361] with the preservative of God's plan and program would begin to pray diligently for our country,
[time=367] many of the things that you and I are concerned about could be turned around.
[time=371] Listen as the Black Hawk's singers share with us their prayer for America.
[time=383] This is my prayer for you America.
[time=391] That God will ever guide your way.
[time=399] We knew all in paths of righteousness, turning your darkness into day.
[time=414] If you are when you are weary, in protection from our life,
[time=427] raising your standard ever higher,
[time=433] giving you all to make us strong.
[time=441] I pray for you America.
[time=448] That God will make you brave.
[time=455] That God will show his power.
[time=471] This is my prayer.
[time=478] Thank you so much for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=497] This is a very special program which is being produced and aired here in our local area.
[time=502] It comes to you by way of our expression of love and devotion to our country, the United States of America.
[time=509] And we are grateful that even though some of you will be receiving it a bit later, you can share a little bit of the music that we are going to be talking about in full tonight in our annual Patriotic Concert.
[time=520] We want to take just a moment to share with our many friends at home again the details of a special program
[time=526] that has just been inaugurated to help in the support of the Bible Hour.
[time=530] That program is called the Sponsors Program.
[time=533] Donna, why don't you share just briefly how the full Sponsors Program works and how people can be involved in it.
[time=540] If you have a special day in your life coming up where you would like to honor a loved one
[time=546] or perhaps remember a loved one who has passed away, we would encourage you to take the time and the money to sponsor a Bible Hour Program in your area.
[time=558] This amounts to quite a bit of money so it's not for everyone, but for those of you who could contribute a sizable gift to the Ministry of the Bible Hour and at the same time pay your honor and love to someone close to you, this is a good opportunity to do it.
[time=573] Donna, next week's program, one of the men who is sponsoring the program here locally and to be sharing with us the details in the joy that he's had in being a part of the Sponsors Program and one of the things that we're happy to do when people sponsor the Bible Hour is to send them a very beautifully engraved plaque that is a reminder to them of the investment they've made in the things of the Lord.
[time=595] The plaque simply says that they sponsored the Bible Hour on a specific Sunday and if they've done it in honor of someone, it tells the name of the person who is the one being honored.
[time=605] And it's a very special plaque that can be hung in the study, in the living room, in the family room, just as a reminder that God is using them to preach the Gospel to many people.
[time=615] Now in just a few days you'll be getting a letter from me, many of you, that relates to the Associate Sponsors Program.
[time=622] This is available to those who cannot sponsor the entire program in a given area but want to be a part of helping and it's a very exciting program that makes it possible for everyone to be involved at the level of their ability and I hope that when you get the mail from my desk you'll take time to read it carefully and that many hundreds of you will get involved in helping us during these summer months to keep the Bible Hour alive and well and the Bible Hour Network as it reaches out to many hundreds of people.
[time=649] We'll be looking forward to hearing from you this week as you express your interest in being a part of sponsoring the Bible Hour where you see it in your area.
[time=658] In just a few moments, we'll give you the address to write but before we do that, let's take a minute and share with them our special book offer of this month.
[time=665] Donna, why don't you tell them a bit about that?
[time=667] Our book at this month is entitled The Home That Stands and it's written by a very special person to us, your dad, and he offers some insights into rearing a family from the experience that he's had
[time=681] and rearing four children in his own home.
[time=684] I think everyone would find it a big help to them if they have children in their home or come in contact with children.
[time=691] Donna, even though my father is a doctor and has a doctor's degree, he writes for the average person and you'll find that it be a very readable book that you can sit down and read in a few moments but he's got some tremendous insights in it from the Word of God.
[time=705] We'd just like to place hundreds of these in homes all over this area.
[time=708] Some of you grandparents maybe feel like it's too late for you to do anything about your home if you'd write and ask us, we'd be happy to send you a copy that you can pass on to your children and it would be an encouragement to them as they have the opportunity of seeing their family grow up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[time=724] Now we'd like to send this book free to all who requested and you can have your copy this week by writing to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=735] When you write, request the book on the home and we'll be happy to send it to you.
[time=740] We also want to remind you that if you're interested in helping us with the sponsors program that same address is the place for you to write.
[time=747] Don, I'll let you share it with them again just so that we give them another opportunity to get this down and be ready to write to us as soon as the program goes off the air.
[time=756] You need to address your letter to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=765] 46-815.
[time=769] And we'll be looking forward to hearing from you this week.
[time=771] Please do not forget to write.
[time=773] We want to hear from all of you who are part of our television family and we'll be looking forward to your letter in the mail this week.
[time=779] It's time now to get back to our morning service.
[time=781] I trust you'll be with us clear to the very end as we share together this very special day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=791] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=842] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=844] And listen now to star Narwhalb as she sings for us.
[time=849] It's time to pray.
[time=851] [MUSIC - 208 seconds]
[time=1074] ♪
[time=1087] Thank you, Starr, for sharing that with us, and it's a true statement put to music, which I hope you will understand as one of the priorities that we have as Americans.
[time=1098] If you have your Bibles, I'm going to ask that you turn with me to the Old Testament and the Book of Malachi, the last book in the Bible.
[time=1107] We are not going to begin the series of messages today that we originally scheduled, and as we move along through the message, you will understand my reasoning in this.
[time=1118] But I want us to read from the third chapter of the Book of Malachi, and I want to begin my reading at the seventh verse, Malachi chapter three and verse seven.
[time=1136] Even from the days of your fathers, you are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them.
[time=1144] Return unto me, and I will return unto you, sayeth the Lord of Host, but she said, in what way shall we return?
[time=1152] Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed me. But she say, how have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings?
[time=1161] You're cursed with a curse, for you've robbed me, even this whole nation.
[time=1165] Bring all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in minehouse, and test me now here with sayeth the Lord of Hosts.
[time=1172] If I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
[time=1180] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field sayeth the Lord of Hosts.
[time=1190] All nations shall call you blessed, for you shall be a delight some land, sayeth the Lord of Hosts, shall we pray.
[time=1200] Father, we pray that you will take control of these next moments of the lips of the speaker, of the hearts and minds and attitudes of the hearers.
[time=1212] We pray that you will defeat Satan in his every attempt to, in any way, change the understanding of those who hear, or the speaking of the one who speaks.
[time=1227] We pray that our attention will be settled upon the thoughts that have been prepared for this message.
[time=1234] And we ask O God that you will use it in the hearts of all of us as we reevaluate where we are as a people, as individuals.
[time=1243] Where conviction is needed, we pray our Father that the Spirit of God will bring conviction to hearts.
[time=1249] Where encouragement is needed, we ask our Father that the simple stating of the principles of thy word will encourage those who abide by them.
[time=1259] If there are those here without Christ, we pray our Father that even this message directed in another direction, apart from them, will have its ministry by the Spirit of God in their hearts to draw them unto thee.
[time=1272] We pray in Jesus' name, and for his sake, amen.
[time=1278] Here in our church in Fort Wayne today, it is the 1st of July, and apart from the fact that it begins along an exciting July 4 weekend, it is the beginning of the second half of the year.
[time=1294] We have moved now through the first six months of 1979.
[time=1299] We now face the second half. From now until the end of December, we have some great responsibilities and opportunities before us.
[time=1311] So far, this has been a year of great blessing.
[time=1314] I don't believe there's ever been in the history of this church a year when more things have happened, more new ministries, and more exciting things have taken place.
[time=1324] It's been the year of the acquisition of new staff members who have come with their gifts of service to minister among us in this body of believers.
[time=1333] Reaching out to our people and to many beside, the Ministry of Counseling has started.
[time=1339] Dr. Nichols and his ministry in the Counseling Center has grown beyond anything we ever imagined to the place where it's almost more than we can do to keep up with it.
[time=1348] We have since added a part-time counselor to give him help so that we might continue to minister to the needs of people.
[time=1354] It has been the year of the beginning of the flock ministry, the ministry of our deacons who have taken upon themselves almost a staff-like position of reaching out to the families within our church and touching them with concern and care.
[time=1368] Already, we're beginning to receive the positive feedback from our families that God is using our deacons to touch their lives in the ministry to personal needs among us.
[time=1378] It has been the year of growth in our Christian school as we have added the 10th grade and now look forward to the 11th grade, additional teachers and programs within the school itself.
[time=1389] It has been the year of Arlington Park. Many of us have found our way through the ruts of the Arlington Park property to drive around over in the Promised Land as we envision what God is going to do for us in the future through the acquisition of this great piece of property that will provide for us room to grow in the years ahead.
[time=1409] It is in essence to most of us who have been a part of it like taking a vision of our future when we drive over there and see the wonderful thing God has done for us.
[time=1419] It's been the year of together we build. As many of us have made sacrificial commitments to the building program and as a church and as a body have committed ourselves over these next three years to give to the Lord's work in building over $1 million above and beyond our regular gifts.
[time=1436] It has been the year of growth and expansion in the television ministry as God has given to us two stations to share the ministry of the Bible hour without charge in Peoria, Illinois and in Redwood, California where they have asked for our program where they have said we want that kind of programming on our station.
[time=1455] And could you send us the tapes will put it on free and we have done it and we're grateful to the Lord for the way he has provided. It's been the year of increased growth in our youth ministry.
[time=1466] Pastor Hawks and his helper Craig Pearson have reached down into the lives and hearts of many young people and even as we speak today there are young people who have just come home from camp this past week and others who are planning to go back again.
[time=1480] The first ever basketball camp is going to be held here in our facilities this summer and the youth ministry is a ministry which is growing not only in dynamism and in numbers but an excitement and commitment to Christ and the part of our young people.
[time=1493] It is the year when God has provided much new equipment for us through special gifts of people. The equipment that we have available now in this physical plant for recreation is the gift of some individuals who care about what God is doing here.
[time=1508] It has been the year of growth in publications as we have extended out into the homes of this community with our this week at Blackhawk newspaper that tells the story of this church to the families of this area.
[time=1519] It has been a year of growth in music and even today as we await the tremendous concert tonight our hearts are excited as we think about what God is going to do for us through the ministry of music tonight.
[time=1530] It is the year when the ministry of music is going to be launched from this church to literally hundreds of churches all over this country as our choir has been chosen to produce the official album of the last few songs Bill and Gloria Gather has written.
[time=1548] Those albums will be released tonight in this auditorium after the concert and will be literally sent to churches all over the country as the album to use in teaching this music to choirs.
[time=1559] I could go on and list many of the things God has done for us. It has been a great six months and God has blessed us and we dare not think about the future without looking back over our shoulders at these last days of blessing and growth in this church.
[time=1574] As a congregation, we are giving more money to the Lord's work than we have ever given before.
[time=1579] If you take all of the money that is given to the ministry of this church, all of the money that is given to the ministry of together we build and the money that is given to television by many people in this congregation, we are probably giving at a much higher level than ever before.
[time=1595] That is great and God bless every one of you who are giving at the level that you ought to be giving for the furtherance of the cause of Christ in this place.
[time=1604] But now we must face these next six months with the same kind of commitment with which we faced the first.
[time=1612] As we look back over the year and assess the blessings that have been ours, we must also look at some of the things that we have not done.
[time=1620] First of all, you know that because of the Together We Build program, we did not have a stewardship month in January.
[time=1627] I don't know what we thought about that except that somehow we probably figure out what to do and in the meantime, we have not figured out what to do.
[time=1635] We have just avoided talking about it and tried to do our very best to stay with it from the beginning.
[time=1642] We did not have a face banquet to raise support for our school because we had channeled all of our energies into Together We Build and that's been good and proper.
[time=1651] And yet we must face the fact that when we don't do something upon which we have built the whole core of our church even in a given year, we will ultimately have to face up to it sometime in the future.
[time=1663] Sometime in the past, we had a meeting in which we told you that we would do our best not to increase the church's budget for the first few months after the Together We Build program because we recognized, or I should say, we assessed the fact that everyone was doing all they could do.
[time=1680] And so for us to raise the budget, we could do it on paper, but it wouldn't do any good because everyone was giving all they could give.
[time=1687] Sometime ago, I met a friend by the name of Sam, and Sam taught me a lesson that I'll never forget.
[time=1697] He is a consultant for large organizations and goes about the country talking to organizations about how to plan for the future and what needs to be done.
[time=1706] And he taught me a lesson one day over lunch.
[time=1709] He said to me, Pastor Jeremiah, there are four things that organizations do that ought to be done as they look to the future.
[time=1717] He said, first of all, they must assess the past. That's important.
[time=1721] He said, secondly, as they look to the future, they must dream wide open.
[time=1725] In other words, he said they must envision everything that they could possibly think that might come into the future in that to which they are giving direction.
[time=1732] Thirdly, they should make a plan related to their dream. And fourthly, they should apply energy to the plan.
[time=1741] Now, my friend Sam said to me, Pastor Jeremiah, the problem with most organizations that I'm aware of in this world today is the fact that they omit number one and number three.
[time=1750] They don't assess the past, and they don't make a plan, and they apply energy to their dream.
[time=1757] And I thought about that, and I said, you know, that may be one of the wisest things anyone said to me in a long time.
[time=1763] It's very easy for all of us to do that, to forget about assessing the past.
[time=1768] And I began to think about the needs of this church and its congregation in the months ahead, with the increased staff, with the increased ministries, with the increased costs of operation as it relates to inflation, the things that you're fighting in your own churches
[time=1782] and that you're fighting in your own homes and in your own businesses. All of those same pressures come to bear upon a church just as well.
[time=1790] And I became aware of the fact that we had a couple of things we need to think about.
[time=1794] Number one, we have two options. We can either begin to think of ways of cutting back in the second half of the year, or we can begin to see if there's some way that God could use us as a congregation to face up to this challenge of 1979, the second half,
[time=1809] and go ahead full steam as we plan for the increased ministry of our church.
[time=1815] One of the mistakes that I made, according to my friend Sam, was I didn't quite assess the past.
[time=1821] You see, I've been operating on the past in this way. I've thought I must protect my people.
[time=1827] Why I can't challenge them to give anymore. Why every one of our families are already doing all they can do.
[time=1834] I just am almost embarrassed to stand up and say, folks, we've got to do better. We've got to give more.
[time=1840] We've got to reach down deeper because I thought all of our people were doing all they could do.
[time=1848] My friend Sam said, why don't you get someone to do an evaluation for you?
[time=1854] And I said, well, all right, but I don't think it'll do any good.
[time=1859] And I ask our business department to do an evaluation.
[time=1864] Oh, it was a sad day in my life when I got the results of that evaluation.
[time=1871] I learned something that just broke my heart at first and then motivated me right out of my skin second.
[time=1882] I learned that the Black Hawk Baptist Church and all that it gives to the Lord's work in its ministry basically is supported by 50% of its people.
[time=1890] That there are 50% of the people who come to this church who don't give even a tithe.
[time=1896] Some who don't give anything at all.
[time=1899] And that if the people of this church would face up to the challenge of being godly stewards, there never would be a need.
[time=1905] We'd ever face in these next six months that we could not meet.
[time=1909] Now, let me just open my heart and let you look into a pastor's heart for a moment.
[time=1913] I'm going to tell you how I felt when I got ahold of that information.
[time=1917] If there's sin involved in this, I'll try to confess it later, but I just want to share with you what I felt.
[time=1924] First of all, I was angry.
[time=1929] Let me tell you why.
[time=1931] I was angry because I know of the time and the effort and the pressure and the involvement and the preoccupation of my mind that has taken away from helping people with spiritual needs because we have to give so much time to the effort of raising the money that's necessary to help people with spiritual needs.
[time=1953] And so I hope it was righteous indignation, but part of the anger in my heart was sort of like this.
[time=1960] Why is it that God's people who are sitting out in the pews of this church don't understand that when they don't do what's right, they cause all of the staff and all of the board and all of the people who are in places of leadership to have to divert energy from spiritual ministries of helping people just because they're lazy
[time=1980] and won't get busy and do what they ought to do in giving.
[time=1984] I was angry.
[time=1986] I asked the Lord to help me work through that.
[time=1991] I had all kinds of thoughts.
[time=1995] I suddenly became aware that some people who come to this church don't give enough money to pay for the chair they sit on.
[time=2002] It's true, some of them don't give enough to the ministry of this church to buy the envelopes we send and put their money in.
[time=2011] And yet they come here every week and they send them to the sound of the Word of God.
[time=2015] They reap and enjoy the blessings of the ministry.
[time=2018] When they have a problem they ring the phone up and say can someone come and help me.
[time=2023] They participate in the heat and the light and all of the blessings that we have in our great facility.
[time=2030] They send their children to our Sunday school, sit under the godly teaching that we have.
[time=2035] They partake of all that's here as the ministry, but they don't do their part.
[time=2041] You know, if I weren't a Christian that'd make me angry.
[time=2046] I don't think that's right.
[time=2048] My first emotion when I came to grips with all of this was anger, but I want you to know I recovered.
[time=2056] I got over my anger and I kind of translated that secondly into some concern.
[time=2061] And I think that's a better emotion at least for a pastor to have because you know pastors aren't supposed to be angry.
[time=2067] I went to a hospital some time ago with my wife when she was desperately ill.
[time=2072] I'm not going to tell you which one.
[time=2074] I'm not here at a blaspheme hospital, but I tried to tell the people she was sick.
[time=2079] And I wanted them to help her. She was about to pass out.
[time=2083] I kept saying, "Would you please give this woman a place to sit down?" And they were so busy things were going on.
[time=2088] And I could just sense that Paul was just building up within me.
[time=2092] And she said, "Honey, I'm going to faint." And she wasn't kidding. She did.
[time=2096] Right? Dead on the floor, right in the lobby.
[time=2100] And all I wanted to do something ungodly.
[time=2105] And it's suddenly dawned on me. A pastor's not ever supposed to get angry.
[time=2110] Somehow, the Lord helped me even though somebody I really loved that they were not taken care of.
[time=2115] I had peace and I said, "Now do you believe me?" You wouldn't believe what kind of results we got after that.
[time=2121] Just like that, man. They were up on a gurney and she was in a room all by herself.
[time=2125] But you know, preachers aren't supposed to get angry.
[time=2127] So if I'm angry unrighteously about all of this, you just forgive me.
[time=2130] I want to tell you it was translated secondly into concern.
[time=2133] Let me tell you why I'm concerned.
[time=2135] I'm concerned because every single member that joins this church reads an application.
[time=2141] And on that application, there's a question that says, "Will you agree to support the ministry of this church with your ties and offerings?" And every person who comes in signs that, "Yes." And there's a whole host of people who have not been faithful to that commitment.
[time=2154] And that concerns me because that's nothing short of deception and lying.
[time=2158] That's not right.
[time=2160] Now you say, "Pastor, that's awful strong, but it's the truth." And that concerns me.
[time=2165] Secondly, I'm concerned because I have known for a long time that what we do with our money
[time=2171] is a pretty good gauge of our spiritual temperature.
[time=2174] The Bible says, "Where your treasure is your heart is?" We are now embarking on the greatest challenge we have ever had as a congregation as we moved to Arlington Park.
[time=2183] And if the statistics I read are true as it relates to the giving to this local church, what that means is we have 50% of our people who are half-hearted about the ministry of this church and men and women there isn't any way under God's heaven.
[time=2195] I'm going to lead an army of half-hearted people toward the challenge of the promised land.
[time=2199] I'm just not going to do it.
[time=2201] There's no way it can be done.
[time=2203] Someone says, "Well, isn't that average?" One of our men, and it was a very good statement, "Isn't that the average?" 50% I said, "Yeah, maybe that's the average." But let's remember that what we're doing as a congregation isn't an average.
[time=2214] The problem with most people today is they want average commitment with above-average joys and opportunities.
[time=2221] Isn't that true?
[time=2223] Everybody wants to belong to an unusual church, above-average church, with a great staff and great facilities and a great future.
[time=2229] My isn't it wonderful to be in a church that's above-average, but they don't want to be above-average in their commitment.
[time=2235] And there isn't any way you can put those two things together.
[time=2238] No way, at least not with me leading.
[time=2241] So I was concerned.
[time=2247] Then I was concerned thoroughly because that not only represents the spiritual temperature.
[time=2252] You show me what a man does with his pocketbook, and I'll show you where he is spiritually.
[time=2256] It also represents his priorities.
[time=2258] Someone wrote a verse some time ago that I came across that goes like this.
[time=2261] It says, "There's nothing left to me of last month's salary.
[time=2265] I live in memory among my canceled checks." You ever feel like that?
[time=2271] I live in memory among my canceled checks.
[time=2274] I'd like to encourage you to go home and live in memory among your canceled checks for just a little while.
[time=2279] And when you do men and women, I'll tell you what's important to you.
[time=2282] You'll see that you believe in a lot of things.
[time=2284] You believe in a home because you'll find a check there for your mortgage.
[time=2288] You'll find out that more and more you believe in transportation.
[time=2291] You'll find checks to all kinds of oil companies, and you believe in transportation a great deal.
[time=2296] You'll find that you believe in education.
[time=2299] There'll be checks there for clothing and school and for Christian school tuition.
[time=2304] You'll find that you believe in education.
[time=2310] But I wonder if you'll find there that you believe in God, that you believe in His work, that you believe in His program.
[time=2321] Because as you live in the memory of your canceled checks, if you don't find any there that relate to your giving to the Lord's work,
[time=2327] you can talk all you want to, but you don't believe in the things of God.
[time=2332] That would be like my saying.
[time=2334] I believe in the importance of having a roof over my family and a home for my children.
[time=2338] But there's nothing in my checkbook that shows that I'm doing anything about it.
[time=2342] James tells us that if we have faith without works, it's dead.
[time=2348] We've got a lot of folks walking around who give the impression that they're really living where they ought to spiritually.
[time=2354] But when you examine where the rubber meets the road, it's not there.
[time=2358] Thank God for everyone who's faithfully doing all they can do.
[time=2362] One of the hard things about preaching a message like this is that someone who is committed at the level of their ability will misunderstand,
[time=2369] but I'm not talking to those folks.
[time=2371] I'm talking to that 50% of this congregation who are not doing what they ought to do, who are causing everyone else to have to do more than they really should do because we're not plugging in where we ought to be.
[time=2383] And I'm serious about it.
[time=2385] It's a very, very important matter for us to face up to.
[time=2389] Somebody said, "Well, you know, I can still come to church and do all the things everybody else.
[time=2395] Sure, you can.
[time=2396] And you may fool a lot of folks.
[time=2398] I don't know who the people are on that survey.
[time=2401] I don't want to know.
[time=2402] And I'll never treat anybody any different because of what they give or don't give.
[time=2406] That's not the issue.
[time=2407] The issue is you can't mock God.
[time=2409] Paul said to the Galatians, "Be not deceived.
[time=2412] God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soeth that shall he also reap."
[time=2419] What does that mean?
[time=2421] Well, if you look that passage up, it's not a general principle.
[time=2424] It's a financial principle.
[time=2426] It's a principle that deals with our giving.
[time=2429] And it says, "If you sow your money to the world, that's what you're going to reap.
[time=2434] If you sow your money to the things of God, that's what you're going to reap." You say, "What is the plan?
[time=2447] What are we supposed to do?" Well, it's interesting that God does have a plan.
[time=2452] From time immemorial, he's had a plan.
[time=2455] His plan is that every Christian be involved in the support of the ministry.
[time=2459] Let every one of you lay by him in store as God has prospered.
[time=2464] That means single people, married people, young people, old people, wage-earning wives, wage-earning husbands, grandparents, grandchildren.
[time=2474] It means everybody, every single individual.
[time=2479] If you took the average income of this congregation and you took 10% of it, it would be more than twice what our budget needs to be as we face the next six months.
[time=2491] That's the bare fact of the situation.
[time=2495] So until everybody does it, we're not living as we ought to as a congregation.
[time=2502] What is his plan?
[time=2503] I've read from the book of Malachi.
[time=2505] Some of you said, "Pastor, I thought you were dispensationalists.
[time=2508] You don't believe in Old Testament tithing? No, I don't.
[time=2510] I believe in New Testament tithing." I believe that from time immemorial, God has given us a pattern that is very discernible that we study the Scripture.
[time=2521] Back in the book of Genesis, long before the law, ever was brought about, we read about Abraham giving tithes unto Melchizedek.
[time=2527] We read about Jacob saying, "If God will bless me, I'll give him a tenth of everything that I have." We come to the book of the law and we discover that not only did they have one tithe for the people of Israel, they had three, that they gave, most of them gave between 23 and 30% of their income back to the things of God.
[time=2548] The Old Testament is very clear that God instructed the Israelites that they were to tithe unto the Lord.
[time=2554] And then we come to the book of Malachi, which was written after Israel had been in decline.
[time=2559] And the prophet Malachi came as a burning torch and as a flaming arrow to the hearts of those people, and he challenged them with their sin.
[time=2568] The sin of unbelief, the whole book of Malachi, is a series of messages by a God-honored prophet who prophesied against the people of Israel because they had fallen into decline and they were backslidden away from God.
[time=2580] And one of the things with which he indicts them is this.
[time=2583] He said, "You have been robbing God." I didn't say that. If I stood in this pulpit today and pointed my finger out like this and said, "Some of you have been robbing God, you'd get mad at me." I don't have to say it. Malachi said it. He said it to God's people.
[time=2599] He said, "You have been robbing God." And you know what they said?
[time=2602] Why? How have we been robbing God?
[time=2608] And he wasn't a man without words. He had the answer.
[time=2613] He said, "You've been robbing God with your ties and offerings.
[time=2616] You've been doing it. You've been taking what belongs to God and putting your own pocket."
[time=2622] You know something? One of the saddest things in this country today is that all over this land Christians will be taking vacations on God's money.
[time=2630] It's true. They'll take the money that belongs to the Lord that's been committed to him.
[time=2634] They'll put it in their pocket. They'll get in their car.
[time=2636] And before they start the engine, they'll say, "Let's bow together and pray for God's blessing as we travel."
[time=2645] Don't understand that. Malachi said to his people, "You've been robbing God." Now, why is tithing God's plan? It's very simple.
[time=2654] First of all, it's an equitable plan. Everyone gets involved.
[time=2659] It's not right that the person who makes $100 should give the same as the person who makes $1,000 a week.
[time=2664] And so God has instituted a plan where everyone gets involved at their level of ability.
[time=2668] It's the minimum standard for the things we do for God today.
[time=2672] Notice what he says. He says, first of all, it's a matter of priority with God.
[time=2676] How are the people responding to this instruction?
[time=2679] Go back in your Bibles to chapter 1, verse 8.
[time=2683] The first thing they were doing, these people of Israel, they were bringing to God things they'd never give anybody else.
[time=2689] He says, "And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?
[time=2693] And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil?
[time=2696] Offer it now to thy governor.
[time=2698] Will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person, sayeth the Lord of hosts?" What is Malachi saying? He's saying, "When you're supposed to tithe your flocks, go out and get a tenth of your flock, you're walking out through the flock seeing if you can find all the blind animals.
[time=2711] And then you get the blind, emaciated old animals, and you bring them to the temple and say, "Here, Lord, here's your offering." And Malachi said, "You wouldn't even get by with that.
[time=2720] And the way you treat the governor, you couldn't pay your taxes that way.
[time=2724] If some of us paid our taxes, the way we give to God, we'd be in jail."
[time=2730] It's true.
[time=2732] Notice in chapter 1, verse 14, he says, "Cursed be the deceiver who hath in his flock
[time=2739] a male and valeth and sacrificeeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing.
[time=2743] For I am a great king, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations." Here's a man who had a male animal in his flock, and instead of bringing it to God, he vows to God that he's going to bring it, and he doesn't do it, and he tries to deceive God.
[time=2757] And if you read in the New Testament, Ananias and Sephira tried to do that too, and they didn't get by with it.
[time=2763] We may live in the age of grace men and women, and we may think we can go on Sunday after Sunday deceiving God with not doing what's right, and we're going to get by with it.
[time=2771] But there's coming a day of reckoning in our lives.
[time=2774] When we'll give an account for the deeds done in the flesh, and I'd sure hate to stand before God someday and give an account of my financial stewardship if I hadn't even done the minimum for the Lord's work.
[time=2786] Tithing is a priority with God.
[time=2790] Chapter 3, verses 3 and 4, bears this out.
[time=2793] "He shall sit like a refiner and a purifier of silver.
[time=2797] He shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord and offering in righteousness.
[time=2804] Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as the days of old and as in former years."
[time=2811] There are many folks who give what I call convenience style.
[time=2816] If I have enough, if things aren't too tight.
[time=2819] Do you know something folks, when we face the inflation that is surely ahead of us, and what some folks are calling the mini-depression, the churches that do not have depth of commitment
[time=2830] that goes beyond convenience giving are going to be in serious trouble.
[time=2834] Because there's coming a day men and women when it's not going to be convenient for any of us to give.
[time=2840] Isn't that true?
[time=2842] It's not convenient for me to give.
[time=2844] I have the same personal needs all of you have, the same problems financially all of you have, and if I only gave because it was convenient or I could find a little extra, I would never give to God.
[time=2854] But there was a day in our lives when Don and I sat down and made a commitment to God that he would have 10% plus of everything we earned and we have never gone back on that commitment.
[time=2864] No matter how tight things have been, God has had what belonged to him, plus.
[time=2870] If you wait until it's easy, some of you will never do it.
[time=2873] He's sitting here 10 years from now, whether it's poor or plush, still trying to figure out whether you can give to God what's rightfully his.
[time=2882] I want you to notice in this passage in the third chapter that tithing is not only a matter of priority with God, it's a matter of proving God.
[time=2889] Someone says, "Well, I don't have the money. What if I give it to God and I go broke?" Well, then God's on the spot because he has promised that when we give to him he'll take care of us.
[time=2897] I'm not talking about financial trading and I'm not one of those people who believes that if you give to God he'll automatically give a lot of financial things back to you. I don't think the Bible teaches that.
[time=2906] The Bible does teach this that when we do what God tells us to do in the total area of our stewardship,
[time=2912] not just in the tenth, but in all the rest of it, God will provide for our needs.
[time=2916] And he challenged through his prophet Malachi to test God out and see whether or not this really worked.
[time=2922] He said, "Bring all the ties into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and test me now.
[time=2928] Prove it. All over this congregation are couples who have said, "I'm going to try that. I'm going to prove it." And they could stand right now in this moment and give testimony to the fact that they cannot out give God.
[time=2938] Every time they give to him he just keeps meeting their needs.
[time=2942] Not always financially. Sometimes it's a spiritual thing he does in their lives, but he has promised and he is not someone who says something and doesn't do it.
[time=2951] Tithing is a means of proving God. Putting God to the test by moving into the area of faith.
[time=2958] Fourthly, tithing is a means of provision by God.
[time=2961] Let me hasten to say, God has promised that when we put him to the test, he will come through.
[time=2968] It says in verse 10 that first of all he provides a personal blessing.
[time=2973] "Bring all the ties into the storehouse that there may be food in my house and test me now." Say at the Lord of Host, "If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing."
[time=2987] Do you think the windows of heaven have been closed your way?
[time=2991] You wonder where the blessing is?
[time=2993] Well, we learned in Sunday school this morning this book is a contract.
[time=2996] We do the part God wants us to do and he does his part.
[time=3000] If the windows have been closed, maybe you better open them.
[time=3003] And one of the ways you open the windows of heaven is start doing what God wants you to do.
[time=3007] They're not going to open by themselves unless you open them through your active obedience in faith.
[time=3012] Secondly, he's promised not only a personal blessing, but a material blessing.
[time=3016] In verse 11 he says, "I will rebuke the devourer for your sake. He shall not destroy the fruits of the ground.
[time=3021] Neither show your vine, cast its fruit before the time in the field. Say at the Lord of Host." What was he saying? He's saying, "If you do right by me, I'm going to care for you.
[time=3029] I'm going to watch out for your needs. I'm going to provide for your family.
[time=3033] I'm not going to let your crops be destroyed." And I wonder sometimes as a pastor, how many things have not happened to me and to my family that could have happened had I not been faithful to the Lord in this matter of stewardship?
[time=3047] We don't know how to chronicle the blessings of God because we don't even have the right grid through which those blessings can come to be enumerated.
[time=3054] But I want to tell you something. I believe this promise.
[time=3057] And if you think it rests upon an archaic Old Testament scripture, stay with me because its counterpart is over in the New Testament.
[time=3064] Thirdly, he says that when we tithe, it brings spiritual blessing.
[time=3068] He said in this same verse, verse 11, verse 12, he said, "All nations shall call you blessed.
[time=3075] For ye shall be a delight some land, say at the Lord of Host.
[time=3079] Someone told me this week, when we were talking about this, that there is a church, and I won't name its name. It's a denomination. It's a cult.
[time=3087] Where the people are automatically committed to tithing is a principle.
[time=3092] It's not an option. I don't know how they police it and I don't want to know.
[time=3096] But they take care of it and everyone tithes.
[time=3100] They build all their buildings with cash.
[time=3103] They pay everything out front. They never have anything behind them that they're dragging along.
[time=3108] And you know something folks, we could be so further down the road than we are if God's people would just operate on the minimum standard.
[time=3116] You say, "Is that an Old Testament truth?" No, listen, here's what Paul wrote.
[time=3121] He wrote this very same truth over in the book of 2 Corinthians.
[time=3126] Let me just read it to you. And as you hear it, listen through the eyes of Malachi through the ears of Malachi. He said, "This I say, He who so sparingly shall reap sparingly.
[time=3140] He who so's bountifully shall reap bountifully.
[time=3144] Every man, according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity. For God loves a cheerful giver." Well, what happens when we give? Verse 8, "And God is able to make all grace
[time=3163] abound towards you, so that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things may abound unto every good work."
[time=3174] That's the same thing he said through Malachi to the Old Testament people.
[time=3178] You do what's right and I'm going to be there taking care of you.
[time=3182] His promise of provision is always related to our obedience to him in this matter of giving.
[time=3191] Now we face some great and glorious days ahead.
[time=3194] I'm encouraged and motivated to see this thing through, but I want to say something to you people.
[time=3199] We can't do it with partial participation.
[time=3202] In these next days, our budget, because we have held back all this first year, has got to take a large increase, right smack in the dead of the desert of summer.
[time=3214] Some of the men who work on the finance committee have said pastor to be a miracle if we make that, and they're right.
[time=3220] But it's a miracle that can be realized if every family in this church just at least comes up to the minimum standard and begins to give a tithe of their income to the things of God.
[time=3232] And if those who are doing the minimum have been stuck in that rut long enough need to move off of it and get up where they belong, we'll do what they ought to do.
[time=3239] If every individual and every couple will reevaluate what they're doing for the work of God in this church, and ask themselves the question, "Am I excited about being a part of an above average church when I'm settling for a below or average kind of commitment on my part?" And then do what they ought to do before God.
[time=3259] That budget will be realized and we won't have to spin our wheels all summer worrying about it.
[time=3265] I faced a challenge.
[time=3268] Either cut back or go ahead.
[time=3271] And my answer to that challenge is we can't cut back when we're doing it to acquiesce to the low level of commitment on the part of some people.
[time=3280] That isn't the answer.
[time=3281] The answer is to get those people up where they belong, and then as a church, as a body, to go together to face the challenge before us.
[time=3291] Next Sunday is all tithe Sunday in this church, and I want every single person and family, at least this one Sunday, to give a tithe of their income to God.
[time=3301] Those of you who are already doing it, you need to do much more.
[time=3303] You can double tithe.
[time=3305] And every second Sunday of every month between now and November, we're going to have that Sunday as a means to try to illustrate and teach that God means business when He says, "Men and women, here's my plan.
[time=3318] You do what you ought to do, and I'll bless you for it.
[time=3322] Shall we pray?" Father, we are so grateful that the principle of the Word
[time=3332] is there.
[time=3334] We recognize that already there's battle raging in the hearts of some folks who don't like to be faced to their responsibility,
[time=3343] but we look back on our lives and we recognize that there's no change without confrontation.
[time=3348] May the Spirit of God take this message and drill it into the hearts of our people until they do what they ought to do, beginning right now, and use them.
