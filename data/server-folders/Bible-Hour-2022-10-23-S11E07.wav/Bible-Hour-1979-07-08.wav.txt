[time=0] Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present
[time=7] the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=32] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=38] We welcome all of our friends who are watching at home, the Bible Hour, which is the televised
[time=45] portion of our morning worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=49] Today is a very special day for all of us, for we have made some special invitations
[time=55] to a wonderful group of people.
[time=58] We refer to them as our senior saints here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=62] They are part of an organization called the Super Sixties, and we're going to be meeting some of those folks in just a few moments as we introduce them to you.
[time=71] We have some very exciting music to share as we worship the Lord together.
[time=75] I hope that you will listen carefully now to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Pastor Don Kruger as they sing for us a beautiful song of praise, praise be to Jesus.
[time=110] Let him who is listening come to hear what we do.
[time=124] Let him who is hungry come by and be made.
[time=134] He can find his school living water when his milk and honey is so sweet.
[time=149] Praise be to Jesus, the sweet golds of children, praise to the Christ, for we deliver our
[time=168] praise, praise to the King who is ready for heaven, the hope of the ages for master and friend.
[time=186] Lord, do you sound the pattern, say pour into morning, the poor, saintly trees and feed us further back.
[time=204] Praise come the poor, get your food, don't you treat, can you plant sprouts from the sand.
[time=220] And then shall the light break forth into morning, bringing beauty for ashes.
[time=233] Strength for the days and hearts that were nourished as family needs presents wrapped in the garment of praise.
[time=251] So praise, praise be to Jesus, the sweet golds of children, praise to the Christ, for we deliver our praise.
[time=271] Praise to the King who is waiting when you are ready for the hope of the ages for master and friend.
[time=290] Praise be to the Jesus, praise me to Jesus.
[time=306] Praise my King, I redeem them.
[time=318] My master and friend.
[time=327] Praise be to Jesus.
[time=348] Thank you, choir.
[time=353] That song is from the record that our choir recently made of all of the newest worship and praise tunes of Bill and Gloria Gather.
[time=361] And we introduced that at our annual patriotic presentation last Sunday night.
[time=366] We're so very proud of the ministry of our choir and of our minister of music and excited about what God is doing through them and the ministry here at this church.
[time=375] Now we're going to listen to some more music that is a very fitting introduction to a special offering that's being received here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church today.
[time=384] This is all tie of Sunday in our church and I couldn't help but notice that Dave Miller, who is our next soloist, is going to sing a song entitled "How Big is God?"
[time=394] We believe he's big enough to meet the needs that we have and we come to him worshiping him not only in our singing and our giving in just a moment.
[time=402] David.
[time=409] [MUSIC]
[time=426] When they strive to go beyond the reef of space to crawl beyond the distant, blempering stars, this world's our room so small.
[time=453] Within my master's house, the open sky, but a portion of his yard.
[time=468] How big is God, how big and wide his vast domain to try to tell these lips can only start.
[time=489] He's standing up to rule his mighty universe, yet small enough to live within my heart.
[time=511] As will his children, may cause the tiny seed to fall, to lie asleep, to wake high summer's rain.
[time=534] The heart from cold will warm and throb with life anew.
[time=544] The master's touch will bring the glow again.
[time=555] How big is God, how big and wide his vast domain to try to tell these lips can only start.
[time=576] He's big enough to rule his mighty universe, yet small enough to live within my heart.
[time=605] Thank you so much for watching the Bible Hour today and for giving us this opportunity in the middle of our telecast to step aside for a few moments and talk with those of you who are friends at home.
[time=622] We do treasure this opportunity because we can set aside the activities that are going on here in the Convocation Center and personally chat with you just as if we were visiting in your living room.
[time=634] During these past days we have been communicating to you about a very special program that well we believe God is going to use to help substantiate the undergirding of the Bible Hour in every market where it is now seen.
[time=647] We've called it the sponsors program. Donna, why don't you share with our friends just briefly what the sponsors program is.
[time=655] The sponsors program is geared towards those people who can give a relatively large gift in support of the Bible Hour and what we do is we ask them if they would like to give a gift in honor of someone or in memory of someone that they specified the date that they would like to sponsor the telecast in their area and then we honor that person on that day.
[time=676] And we've been gratified to see God begin to move in the hearts of people to respond to this and we're just grateful that today we can introduce one of our sponsors and we'd like to talk with him.
[time=687] He's a friend of our church, Mr. Max Porman. Max, today is the day that you're sponsoring the Bible Hour here in the Fort Wayne area and I know that you're doing it for somebody very special to you.
[time=699] Right, my mother. And your mother is still living, what is her name and is she watching today?
[time=706] I trust she is, her name is Mrs. Grace Porman. She lives at Vernon, Indiana and she's 81 years old.
[time=712] 81 years old and I know that she's had a special part in the spiritual growth and development in your own life, isn't that true?
[time=721] Very true, for when I was growing up in Central Illinois many years ago, why I am at two brothers, John and Len, whenever there was a revival being held within 20 miles of where we were living, my mother saw to it that we attended it usually many times, six and seven nights a week.
[time=737] And that's how you came to know about the Lord Jesus Christ and began to grow in your knowledge of him.
[time=743] That's how he became very dear to me and I love him today for it.
[time=746] Max, one of the things that we're doing for our sponsors that I'm pretty excited about is not only allowing them the privilege of being a part of sponsoring the Bible Hour and there's a sense in which today you're preaching the gospel to many, many hundreds of people, perhaps more people in one hour
[time=763] than many people will get a chance to preach to in a lifetime.
[time=766] But we want you to have a special moment of this occasion and so we've prepared a very beautiful plaque that says that on this Sunday, Max and Mabel Porman sponsored the Bible Hour in Fort Wayne in honor of Mrs. Grace Porman.
[time=781] And we want to present this to you in just a few moments for you to have and I hope you'll hang it in a very prominent place in your home and as you look at it, remember that on this particular Sunday, God allows you to have the privilege of helping us in a very special way
[time=795] to preach the gospel through the Bible Hour.
[time=798] In fact, I think I won't wait until we're off the air. I'll just give it to you right now and I trust it will be something that you will treasure in the years ahead.
[time=805] Thank you very much.
[time=807] And we thank you for your help and as we consider what Max has done and what others like him are doing in the other areas where the television ministry has seen, we want to remind all of you that there is another way that you can help.
[time=820] Along with the sponsors program, there's an associate sponsors program which makes it possible for a number of people to contribute to the Bible Hour so that the combined total of their gifts will underwrite the program in a given area.
[time=835] Many of you have received letters from my desk in recent days about the associates program and I hope that you will respond and that God will use you to help us preach the gospel as we go forward with the Bible Hour.
[time=847] Now Donna, I've been doing most of the talking this morning and I want to give you an opportunity before we go back to the morning service to share with our friends at home our special gift offer of a book this month and I'll let you do that right now.
[time=860] Our special offer this month is entitled The Home That Stands and that is written by my father-in-law Dr. James T. Jeremiah, formerly president of Cedarville College.
[time=871] And we would like for you to have your copy of this little booklet and all you need to do is write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and just tell us that you would like the copy of the booklet on the home by Dr. Jeremiah and we'll be happy to send one to you.
[time=890] You did that very well. Thank you. And I want to say a special word of thanks to Grace Porman for giving us her son and to Max and Mabel Porman for the gift that they have made to the Bible Hour in honor of your mother, Max.
[time=906] And I want to also encourage all of you who are watching. If you would like to be a part of the sponsors program of the Bible Hour, please be sure to drop us a line and let us know if you don't have the information about it, we'll be happy to send it to you.
[time=919] We do need to hear from many of you during these summer months and we thank you each one for your prayer and your support of this ministry which is rooted in the Word of God and goes out into homes all over the Midwestern part of our country with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=935] Once again, before we go back to our service, the address that you need to remember is this one. Right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. We'll be looking forward to hearing from you this week.
[time=965] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=982] A few weeks ago, my wife and I had the wonderful privilege of visiting the Grace Village Retirement Center in Warsaw, Winona Lake, Indiana.
[time=990] We met some of the most wonderful people that day and from that experience grew the opportunity that we have before us today to share our morning service with a great host of senior people, many of them from the Grace Village and others from here in our own area.
[time=1007] And I want to ask all of our senior people who are visiting with us today, whether they be from Winona Lake or from here as a part of our super 60s ministry, if they would please stand so that we could welcome them to the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Would you please stand for us right now?
[time=1024] I think we ought to. Thank you so much for being here. You may be seated. We're grateful to have you. And after the morning service, all of the staff of the church and their families are going to be eating lunch with these dear folks.
[time=1052] And we're going to have a great time of fellowship together. I want to ask George Lantman, who is the director of our senior ministry here, if he would come and stand with me at the microphone just a moment.
[time=1062] George, I know that the senior ministry is something that goes on here during the week and sometimes doesn't see all of the fanfare that some of the other things see, but tell our folks just a bit about what happens on Friday.
[time=1078] Well, super 60s is a great group of people. We meet each Friday at 10 o'clock and we have a great time of fellowship, a great time of getting together, we eat a lunch and we have a good spiritual blessing.
[time=1093] And there's many, many who come out 55 to 105. We may make a little reservation there if you're over 105, but we have a great group coming out and we have a good time. It's a good time of fellowship.
[time=1105] And we didn't invite any that are in the hearing audience here that are 55 to 105 come out on Friday, 10 o'clock.
[time=1113] You've taken some trips, haven't you, George? And it doesn't always happen right here. I see him getting on buses and going on a trip someplace. Where have you been?
[time=1120] Yes, well, our last trip was down to Bear Creek Farms and we had just less than 101. We had 99 with us to Bear Creek Farms. We had a great time there.
[time=1131] This week we're going to go this Friday to Lincoln Museum and then down to the airport and have dinner there.
[time=1137] Well, I think it's almost worth being 55 for that stuff. You know, that's great.
[time=1141] Well, we've got plans passed to go to Hawaii someday.
[time=1144] Alright. That's great, isn't it? I think some people just moved up in the age of pride.
[time=1152] George, thank you. Let's just say a word of prayer together. Shall we for these dear people and for this ministry that God has given us? Why don't you leave us?
[time=1159] Our Heavenly Father, we thank thee that light love extends to all ages, not just to the young, but through all ages.
[time=1167] We thank thee that thou art with us always, even to the end of this world.
[time=1171] We pray for each one that's come out today, that thou would suit a blessing to them and meet their every need in accordance with thy word.
[time=1178] We pray this in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1181] Amen. Thank you, George.
[time=1183] And there is no relationship between what we have just done and my announcement of the next special music.
[time=1189] I want you to meet Mr. and Mrs. Don Kruger, who are going to come and sing for us.
[time=1193] Someone has said he's the young man with the old hair.
[time=1197] They're going to sing for us right now.
[time=1202] One day I lost my way, and no one cared.
[time=1226] I sought for happiness, but found a spell.
[time=1239] Then Jesus spoke to me, revealed to me my sin.
[time=1252] I'll be your broken heart, if I may enter in.
[time=1263] A broken heart, I pray, a worthless sleep.
[time=1275] And empty life was high, that I could breathe.
[time=1286] Then Jesus filled my life with love divine.
[time=1298] Me and you are my broken heart, and now I know he's mine.
[time=1321] Have you been wondering why you're alone?
[time=1332] Does God seem far away?
[time=1338] You doubt his love.
[time=1343] Now Christ is at your door.
[time=1349] He sees the heart that's dead.
[time=1355] He shed his blood for you to be alive for you.
[time=1366] A broken heart, I pray, a worthless sleep.
[time=1377] And empty life was all, that I could breathe.
[time=1388] Then Jesus filled my life with love divine.
[time=1399] Me and you are my broken heart, and now I know he's mine.
[time=1432] Knowing Don as I do, I'm sure he chose that song just to minister to the special people who were here today.
[time=1439] There's one other person that I want to ask to stand, and sometimes these are the people who get neglected more than anyone else.
[time=1447] The senior citizen's ministry of Super 60s couldn't happen here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1452] We're not for a very hard working woman who coordinates all of the lunches and takes care of a lot of the correspondence
[time=1459] and stands behind her husband in every way, works many long hours here, sometimes unnoticed.
[time=1465] And I think we ought to express our appreciation to Mary Lampman for all the hard work that she's put into the Super 60s.
[time=1471] Mary, stand up, will you? Just turn around so folks can see you.
[time=1486] We appreciate you, and thank God for bringing you to us.
[time=1489] We're going to listen now to the ministry of Marilyn Wong as she comes to sing for us just before the message is song about ordinary people.
[time=1506] Just ordinary people. God uses ordinary people. He chooses people just like me and you who are willing to do us he commands.
[time=1533] God uses people that will give him all. No matter how small your all might seem to you because little becomes much as you place it in the master's name.
[time=1561] Just ordinary people. God uses ordinary people. He chooses people just like me and you who are willing to do us he commands.
[time=1589] God uses people who give him all. No matter how small your all might seem to you because little becomes much as you yield it to the master's name.
[time=1617] Well, just like that little man, he gave Jesus all he had. How the bountitudes were fed with the fish and loaves of bread.
[time=1630] What you have may not see much, but when you yield it to the touch of the master's love he had, can you understand how your life could never be?
[time=1646] Just ordinary people. God uses ordinary people. He chooses people just like me and you who are willing to do us he commands.
[time=1675] God uses people who will give him all. No matter how small your all might seem to you because little becomes much as you yield it in the master's name.
[time=1704] God uses ordinary people just like you because little becomes much as you yield it in the master's name.
[time=1734] Thank you, Marilyn. Any who have been used must certainly give thanks to God that the truth of that is presently applied in our own lives. God uses ordinary people if it were not for that who of us could be used.
[time=1749] And how thankful we are that he does that. He chooses the weak and the foolish things of this world to glorify the name of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1762] Our studies these summer days are in the book of John in the 17th chapter. We come to the second message in this series to which we have given the title the Lord prays for his own.
[time=1776] So if you have your Bibles I hope you will turn with me to John chapter 17 and we will study together the second in this series of messages.
[time=1789] The prelude to the prayer John chapter 17 and I want to read just the first verse of the 17th chapter for it is the text which helps us to understand our subject for today.
[time=1803] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify the shall we pray together.
[time=1821] Father as we come to this portion of thy word we feel as Moses was instructed to feel as he stood before the burning bush that he was to take off his shoes for the ground upon which he stood was holy ground.
[time=1837] We have read what others have said about this great high priestly chapter and we come to it recognizing that we are not worthy to come in upon its truth.
[time=1851] Bless the Holy Spirit should take its words and drive them into our own hearts and give to us spiritual understanding that we know is illumination.
[time=1861] We will be at a loss to fathom its great truth. There is a message here for each one of us today.
[time=1869] As we sort through the various things which have stimulated our minds during these last moments we pray that you will help us to pull the curtain on the cares of the world and
[time=1880] open up a place in our heart and mind for the word of God to be deposited and that we might listen with our hearts and with our heads that we may go forward from this place to be not simply hearers of the word but doers also.
[time=1896] And we thank you for what you're going to do through the ministry of the word of God today. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=1906] All of the great expositors of days gone by have attributed to the 17th chapter of John a very special place in the archives of scriptural instruction.
[time=1922] A great expositor by the name of Bishop Ryle has said about the 17th chapter that in this chapter we have begun the most remarkable chapter in the Bible.
[time=1933] "It stands alone," he said, "and there is none like it in all of the scripture."
[time=1940] The great reformer named Melanchthon as he reviewed the 17th chapter of John wrote these words concerning this chapter.
[time=1949] He said, "There is no voice which has ever been heard, either in heaven or in earth, more exalted, more holy, more fruitful, more sublime than the prayer offered up by the Son to God Himself."
[time=1966] William Kelly, a more recent teacher of the word of God, has said that this is a chapter which one may perhaps characterize truly as unequal for depth and scope in all of the scriptures.
[time=1979] Why is it so? Why is it that the 17th chapter of John has been put on a shelf above all other shelves and we look to it as the most sacred of all the chapters in the Gospels?
[time=1992] It is because here are recorded the words of the Savior, the Son of God who walked among men as he poured out his heart to the Father in heaven.
[time=2003] And we have a record of that written down for our learning and admonition.
[time=2008] And as we report it in the first message, it gives to us a glimpse into the throne room of glory where the Savior today makes intercession for us all and helps us to understand the kind of prayer that he prays for us today as we hear walk upon this earth and he intercedes for us in heaven.
[time=2027] This is the holy of holies of the New Testament. It is the high priestly prayer of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=2037] And today I want us to look just at the first phrase of the chapter, for it gives to us a clue which we must not miss if we are to understand the depth of teaching found here.
[time=2050] We read these words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven.
[time=2056] And when we read that phrase, we ask ourselves the question, what words?
[time=2061] What words did Jesus speak?
[time=2064] I have to admit that having read that chapter many times before, I assume that it was an introduction to the prayer, these words, in other words, the words that are about to be spoken, the words of the prayer.
[time=2076] But as you study it in the construction of the New Testament, you understand that it is not a look forward to the prayer, but it is a reminder to look backward to the preaching which was a prelude to the prayer.
[time=2090] These words spoke Jesus reminds us that for us to understand the prayer, we must go back in the book of John to the chapters immediately preceding it, and understand the words which Jesus spoke before he prayed the prayer.
[time=2106] Now all of this begins back in the 13th and 14th chapter of the book of John. If you have your Bibles and you turn back to the 14th chapter, to the 13th chapter, you will discover that chapters 13 through 16 of the book of John contains some of the most intimate messages Jesus ever gave to his disciples.
[time=2128] We refer to it as the upper room discourse. It is that message which Christ gave to his disciples to communicate to them what they needed to know before he was to go to his death at the cross and ultimately be buried and resurrected.
[time=2145] It was the legacy of the Savior which he left with his own, a last word of teaching, if you will, to communicate to them the most important things for them to know as he was about to leave this earth to go back to be with his father.
[time=2160] And these words which are recorded here are the words to which the writer of the Gospel of John refers when he says these words spake Jesus and then lifted his eyes up to heaven.
[time=2172] It is as if he took his eyes off of the earth now having spoken these words to his disciples and he prayed a prayer that God would take the words that had been spoken and so teach them to the hearts of his disciples that they would never forget.
[time=2187] Now in our services when we worship together it is quite often the case that when we have our worship services we have the pastoral prayer before the preaching.
[time=2198] But the Lord has reversed that. He has the preaching first and the pastoral prayer second. He teaches them the doctrine and then he prays in this great prayer of the 17th chapter that that truth would be so marvelously drilled into the hearts and lives of these disciples
[time=2216] that they would never forget what they had been taught. You see men and women we cannot understand the Savior's prayer if we do not know something about the preaching that took place beforehand.
[time=2227] And so I'm going to ask you to selectively read with me through these chapters to get the background of the prayer.
[time=2234] Here is the prayer based upon the preaching. Here is the theology first and the worship second. What is it that our Lord was communicating to his disciples?
[time=2248] Let us notice as we look at these chapters in the Word of God that first of all he taught them concerning his identity. In chapter 14 of the book of John verses 8 and 9 there is one of the most insightful questions that one of the disciples had ever asked.
[time=2262] Philip said unto him, John 14 8, "Lord show us the Father and it sufficeth us." Jesus said unto him, "Have I been such a long time with you and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?
[time=2275] He that have seen me have seen the Father and how sayest thou then show us the Father." The first thing that I want you to notice in the preaching of Jesus is this.
[time=2284] He taught his disciples definitively concerning his identity as the God man, the Messiah, the Christ.
[time=2293] Philip said, "Lord show us the Father." And Jesus said, "There's no need to do that. If you have seen me, you have seen the Father. I and the Father are one."
[time=2301] Jesus taught his disciples again in these last will and testament words that came from his mouth that his identity was the identity of the Christ, the God.
[time=2312] In the day when there is so much dispute over the identity of Jesus Christ and men in the pulpits of our land are forgetting that he was God in the flesh.
[time=2320] It is refreshing to go back to the Word of God as our standard in source and be reminded of the fact that Jesus emphasized his own deity as he taught his disciples.
[time=2331] We read in the text in chapter 14 in verse 2 that secondly he taught them concerning his immediate plans with them.
[time=2340] In chapter 14 and verse 2 he told his disciples, "In my Father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
[time=2352] The second truth that I want you to notice from the preaching of the Savior is this. He communicated to them that after he had left this earth he was going to be busy in their behalf. He had some immediate plans and those plans had the disciples in mind.
[time=2367] He was going to prepare a place for them in heaven. We used to sing a song when I was growing up, "Lord build me a cabin in glory land."
[time=2376] And when I think of that I read this verse and I thank God I'm not going to be living in a cabin in glory land. The Lord is working on some mansions for us.
[time=2385] I'm not a camper, I've told you that and if heaven is cabins the Lord and I are going to have to discuss that together. But he's building a mansion for us and right now he is continuing the work which he promised to do to the disciples. He is building a place for us.
[time=2401] He has an immediate plan and is working on that as it relates to you and to me. Thirdly he taught his disciples in this great discourse concerning his intercessory ministry in their behalf.
[time=2415] If you had walked along the pathways with the Savior in his ministry as he worked his miracles, if he had ministered to you personally as he had to the disciples, one of the questions foremost in your mind would have been this. When he is gone, when he is back in heaven, when he has left this globe and gone back to be with his father, then to whom do I bring my problems? Who do I talk to then? How can I know the will of my master for me if he is not present?
[time=2443] And so the Lord Jesus communicated to his disciples in chapter 14 verses 13 and 14, these words, "And whatever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son, if ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it."
[time=2460] He communicated to them that he was going to intercede for them if they would ask in his name according to his character and representative of all that he was when he was in heaven, he would hear and answer their prayer.
[time=2473] What a comfort that must have been to the disciples as they faced the loss physically of the one that had come to love. He taught them concerning his intercessory ministry in their behalf.
[time=2484] Fourth, he taught them concerning his intimate love for them. Notice in chapter 15 in verse 9 that he communicated to them in this last message which he presented to them before his death, "As the Father hath loved me, so I have loved you, continue in my love."
[time=2505] There is more truth in that one verse than could be comprehended or expounded in a month of Sundays, "As the Father hath loved me, so I love you."
[time=2517] Some time ago in the series of messages we were reminded of a very important formula that says that if we will become to Jesus what Jesus is to the Father, then Jesus will become to us what the Father is to him.
[time=2534] That truth is here illustrated when we are reminded that in this great high and holy passage Jesus communicated his love to his disciples and he based the love relationship which he had for his disciples with that love relationship that he knew from the Father in heaven.
[time=2552] He said, "As I feel and know and understand the love of my Father for me, I want you to know that all that is involved in that relationship is involved in my relationship with you. I love you. I intimately, warmly, wonderfully love you.
[time=2568] The tenderness of our Savior is seen in those very precious words. May I say to you that that commission and that promise that was given to the disciples in that upper room discourse is the same promise repeated over and over again to all of God's children.
[time=2584] He says it to all the senior saints and to all who aren't senior saints, that as the Father loves him, he loves us. He communicated his intimate love.
[time=2597] But we look on through these pages of the teaching of the Savior and we learn number five that he taught them concerning his inevitable return.
[time=2605] Again, the question that would come to your mind if you were a disciple, having walked with the Lord Jesus and known him and felt him and been a part of his life when he communicated that he must go away to be with his Father, the question would come to your mind. Will I ever see him again?
[time=2622] Will I ever again know him as I know him today? Will there be a time in the future when we will know the fellowship that we have known now physically, personally? Will I ever again place my hand in the hand of the Savior and know the touch of his hand upon mine?
[time=2641] Jesus was ever so tender and ever so careful to communicate in this last word from his lips that his return was inevitable, for he says in John 14 verse 3, these words, "And if I go and prepare a place for you, listen now, I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also.
[time=2663] I'm going away, yes, but listen now, I'm coming back. It's not an if, it's not a maybe, it's an inevitability. I am coming again to receive you unto myself."
[time=2674] And every Christian who has known the historic faith of this book stands waiting with open heart for the soon return of Jesus Christ.
[time=2684] We have been listening these days to all of the alternative plans for the oil crunch and for the inflated market and for the loss of the value of the dollar. I don't hear too many people saying that one of the possibilities is that the Lord will come back and end the whole mess.
[time=2701] But every Christian ought to have that hope beating within him because he has promised that inevitably he will return and as the disciples fought with their inner feelings of grief and loss and sorrow, there was a ray of hope that shined out into their hearts and it was this, I'm coming back.
[time=2718] I'm coming back to receive you unto myself and just as surely as I go to prepare a place, you can rest assured that I will come back.
[time=2725] He taught them concerning his inevitable return. These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes unto heaven. Can't you begin to sense how God through Christ had set the stage for this holy prayer as he taught them these high and noble truths which were to be the stabilizing of their lives in the difficult days ahead?
[time=2746] He taught them concerning his inevitable return. Number six, he taught them concerning the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. In chapter 14 verses 16 and 17, he gave to them a truth that they had not understood before.
[time=2761] He said, "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, and the word another there is a word which means another just like the one you have already known, another like unto, another one of the same kind and quality as the one you have known, obviously a reference to himself.
[time=2780] I will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Now notice the doctrine that he taught. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it's see of him not, neither know of him, but you know him.
[time=2795] Now look at this carefully, for he dwelleth with you, and he shall be in you." That phrase of scripture is a hinge statement which gives to us the Old Testament and the New Testament ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2810] In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit did not dwell within believers. He came upon them selectively. He came upon Samson. He came upon Saul. He came upon David selectively for a ministry, a specific time and place ministry. He dwelt with them.
[time=2829] But Jesus said, "There's coming a time in the near future when the Holy Spirit will come from heaven, and he won't be dwelling with you. He'll be dwelling in you." He is not going to dwell with you selectively, but he is going to dwell in you eternally.
[time=2844] And he taught his disciples the ministry of the indwelling spirit who would come to live within them. Once in a while people say, "I wish I lived in the time when Christ was alive so that I could be with him." And I think all of us have felt that at some time or another. It would have been wonderful to be with him on the road to Emmaus, or when he resurrected Lazarus from the dead and all of those other great experiences, but I want you to think about something.
[time=2868] Only a few believers could be with him at any one given time, at any one period, or any one place. He was localized in his ministry on this earth by the physical barriers which he voluntarily took upon himself.
[time=2884] But when he went back to heaven he did something far better for us. He is not localized in his ministry now, for he has sent the Holy Spirit into the heart and life of every believer so that wherever we are he is with us in the person of the Spirit of God.
[time=2899] And so you see we are at an advantage over those who lived in the New Testament. We have the Spirit of God with us always at all times. It is not localized or selective. It is ever present with us eternally indwelling us.
[time=2913] And that was part of the great legacy which he gave to his disciples as he prepared them for his going. He taught them concerning the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2923] He taught them concerning the importance of fruit bearing. All of the 15th chapter is the key to having a fruitful life. And I wish we had time to look at it today, but you know it.
[time=2933] It is the abiding principle that the vine and the branches must be in connection with one another if there is to be fruit in a person's life.
[time=2943] He taught them concerning the importance of fruit bearing, of being productive Christians. He taught them number eight about the importance or the impending danger that lay before them.
[time=2954] The Lord Jesus Christ did not give them a sugar-coated sermon or a candy-coated characterization of what was coming, but he told them that they should expect some problems.
[time=2965] We need to hear that message today. There are a lot of Christians who think that the Christian life is one happy dream, but the Bible never paints it that way. The Bible tells us that in this life, in this world, there are going to be difficulties.
[time=2978] And so the Savior was preparing his loved ones for the difficulties that would come, and that were coming to them in the future. In chapter 15, verses 18 to 21, he outlines for them what they should be expecting.
[time=2990] He says, "If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own, but because you're not of the world, but I've chosen you out of the world. Therefore the world hated you." Remember the word that I said unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord.
[time=3007] If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you, and if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also, but all these things will they do unto you for my namesake because they know not him that sent me. Jesus said to his disciples, "I don't predict for you glory and wonderful experiences and all positive things. I'm telling you they're going to be difficulties in the future. If they persecuted me, your Savior, should you expect anything less than that?"
[time=3035] So he prepared them for impending danger. Nine, but certainly not conclusive nor not last in order. He taught them concerning the infinite peace, which was to be their legacy. In the 16th chapter and in verse 33, this is what he said.
[time=3055] These things, all that we have talked about in this outline form, very rapidly surfacing across this great discourse, these things have I spoken unto you that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.
[time=3074] Jesus said last of all before he entered into this prayer, "I want to remind you that there will be difficulties and troubles, and it's going to be a life not filled with glory all the time, but there's going to be a peace that comes into your life. It is my peace. And though you will have tribulation in the world, just remember that I've overcome the world.
[time=3094] And my legacy to you, my disciples, said the Savior is this, "A kind of peace that passeth understanding, a peace the world knows not. It shall be your present, intimate, experiential privilege as you walk with me."
[time=3111] Now why did the Savior communicate these things? Why did he spend so much time talking about these heavy doctrinal truths?
[time=3120] There are three verses in this section of Scripture which give to us the purpose of his instruction. I will just quickly point them out to you.
[time=3129] First of all, he taught them these things because he wanted their joy to be full. John 1511 says this, "These things I have spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full."
[time=3146] There is a clue here, Christian, that we ought not to miss. If you want to have full joy in your life, here are the things that will bring it to pass.
[time=3155] The knowledge and experience of these great truths here in these chapters are the causes and the sources of joy, full joy in your life.
[time=3165] He said, secondly, in chapter 16 in verse 1, "These things I have spoken unto you, that you should not be offended."
[time=3173] And the word offended here means cause to stumble. There is one thing that will keep you from being blown out of the Christian life, and that is if you've got the right information.
[time=3183] A lot of Christians are getting blown away today because they've got the wrong information.
[time=3187] Jesus said, "I want to give you the right information so that when you get in the midst of the troublesome world in which you live, you won't be blown out of the saddle and you won't be caused to stumble, you won't be offended because you've got what I want you to know.
[time=3201] And if we can get doctrine up here from the Word of God that will help us to prepare for our situation, there's no reason for us to be blown about, like every wind on the open sea."
[time=3212] He taught them these things that they wouldn't be offended in thirdly. We have already read the verse. He taught them these things that they might have His peace.
[time=3221] These things have I spoken unto you that my peace might be in you.
[time=3228] These are great truths. The deity of Christ, His soon return, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the infinite love of Christ, His will for us in our everyday experience, fruit bearing, wonderful peace.
[time=3245] And having preached such a great message to His disciples, then the Scripture says, "Having spoken these things," He lifted up His eyes to heaven.
[time=3255] Isn't it interesting that in these closing words from the lips of the Savior there is not one word of His own sorrow?
[time=3263] There is not one word of Gethsemane, no Golgotha. There is no words of the judgment hall or scourging or the crown of thorns or the spears or the epitaphs.
[time=3276] None of that, and though He knew it intimately, He has He set His face toward the cross. He did not spend His closing moments with His own sorrow, but He wrapped His arms of love around His disciples, and He reached out to them to try to help them be prepared for the experience that was before them.
[time=3296] It was not of His own sorrow, but of His peoples, that His heart was full. Does He not even in His Spirit teach us, that as Christians?
[time=3306] Our purpose in living and teaching and moving about in this world is not that we might dwell upon our own difficulties and our own sorrows and all of the problems that we have, but with the truth of the Word of God we might reach out to hurting men and women everywhere, with the comfort of hope from the Scripture.
[time=3325] And some are such as you. Some of you are here today who need the touch of the Spirit of God upon your life because of the difficulties you are facing.
[time=3336] Let me say to you, with all of the sincerity of my heart, God loves you. He loves you with a love like the love He feels from His Father, and today He would reach out to touch your life where you are, if you will be open toward Him. Shall we pray?
[time=3354] While our heads are bowed, and before we pray, let me just encourage you, if you don't know Jesus Christ, He knows you, and He reaches out towards you through this message and through this service today, and He would have you become one of His.
[time=3370] You can become a Christian by putting your trust in Jesus Christ, by asking Him to come into your life and be your Savior.
[time=3376] You can do it wherever you are in the chair, here in the auditorium, in your home, wherever you are a part of this service. Simply bow your head and ask Jesus Christ to come into your life and forgive your sin and be your Savior, and He'll do it.
[time=3391] He's promised to do it. He'll do it for you. And Father, we pray that there will be many today.
