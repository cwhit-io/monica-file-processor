[time=18] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=27] [MUSIC]
[time=57] [ Singing ]
[time=74] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=76] [SILENCE]
[time=80] >> Thank you for your good singing.
[time=82] We welcome those who have joined us now by way of television to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=88] We are engaged during these summer days in the study of the 17th chapter of the book of John, the great high priestly prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=99] Though it is a high and lofty doctrinal treatise, it is also a very practical section of the Word of God that has truth for us where we live today.
[time=109] It is interesting to me that in our generation, we are fighting as Christians with the fastest pace of life.
[time=117] The universe is ever known.
[time=119] And though we understand and contemplate the importance of living within the will of God according to his time plan, it is very easy for us because of the fast pace around us
[time=133] to get caught up in the frenzied activities of the fast-paced generation in which we live.
[time=142] In the lesson from the Word of God today, we learn from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ what it meant for him to operate upon a divine schedule so that he fulfilled the work which the Lord gave him to do, and yet never seemed to be in a hurry.
[time=163] I trust that your Bibles will be open and your heart and spirit open to what God will say to us from his Word as we look to it in just a few moments.
[time=172] Right now, it's time to listen to our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger as they begin the worship part of our service this morning.
[time=196] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=335] [MUSIC] I lost it all [MUSIC] To find everything [MUSIC] Everything [MUSIC] I had won [MUSIC] All I could win [MUSIC] There was no place [MUSIC] I hadn't been [MUSIC] But my heart was just so needy [MUSIC] And so poor [MUSIC] And I heard him gently say [MUSIC] Oh, lose it all [MUSIC] And find my way [MUSIC] And so I gave it up [MUSIC] And found it all [MUSIC] And more [MUSIC] I lost it all [MUSIC] To find everything [MUSIC] I died a pop-o [MUSIC] To become a pain [MUSIC] When I learned how to lose [MUSIC] Then I found out how to win [MUSIC] I lost it all [MUSIC] To find everything [MUSIC] I was frantic [MUSIC] To survive [MUSIC] I was running [MUSIC] To arrive [MUSIC] And I walked on any standing [MUSIC] In my way [MUSIC] But I heard him gently say [MUSIC] Oh, lose it all [MUSIC] And find my way [MUSIC] So I gave it up [MUSIC] But I found it all [MUSIC] And more [MUSIC] I lost it all [MUSIC] To find everything [MUSIC] I died a pop-o [MUSIC] To become a pain [MUSIC] Oh, when I learned how to lose [MUSIC] Then I found out how to win [MUSIC] To find everything [MUSIC] Then I learned how to lose [MUSIC] Then I found out how to lose [MUSIC] Then I found out how to lose [MUSIC] I lost it all [MUSIC] But I found everything [MUSIC]
[time=677] Thank you so much for joining us today on The Bible Hour and for allowing us this privilege of coming into your home to share with you the Word of God in music and in message and to step aside during this particular point in our service to talk informally with you at home.
[time=696] My wife Donna has joined me as usual and we counted a real privilege to have this informal chat with you each week.
[time=703] Donna, we have been involved over the past few weeks in the initiation and inauguration of a new program called the Sponsors Program.
[time=711] It has been very exciting to me to see how God has laid upon the heart of many of our people the desire and determination to get behind the Bible Hour in a very special way.
[time=723] Why don't you share with our friends at home and just briefly what the Sponsors Program is.
[time=728] The Sponsors Club is made up of individuals who desire to sponsor the Bible Hour in their particular area on a given Sunday and they might just desire to do this as a means of helping the Bible Hour or perhaps they would like to do it to honor a loved one or in memory of a loved one and we ask that they send the money to sponsor the program in their area for that particular Sunday.
[time=752] One of the things that's been exciting to me is to recognize that there are people who watch the Bible Hour who are capable of supporting us at that level and many of them who are anxious to have that kind of part in the ministry that the Bible Hour sustains and we've also discovered a great number of friends, a host of friends who want to be a part as associate Sponsors.
[time=773] An associate sponsor is someone who sends $100 each week or $100 for the support of a weekly telecast and that support helps us to carry on the ministry as it goes out over the year.
[time=787] During these next few weeks we're going to be sharing some of the associate Sponsors with our friends and I know you have one that you want to mention today as a part of this telecast.
[time=795] Our sponsor today is a Founders Club member and her name is Marsha Geyer and she is from Fort Wayne.
[time=803] She watches the program on Channel 21 and we're really thankful to Marsha for her willingness to have this part in the ministry.
[time=810] Don, I have in my hands the certificate that Marsha will be receiving this week with her name on it showing that she's a part of the Bible Hour Ministry and that she's an associate sponsor of this particular program that's going out over the air today.
[time=825] Marsha, you'll be receiving this soon and I trust it will be something you'll treasure as a reminder to you that you've had this very special part in preaching the gospel to many hundreds of thousands of people through the Bible Hour Network here in the Midwest.
[time=838] While we're talking about the Sponsors program, let me encourage you to be very concerned with us and prayerful with us that God will raise up many more sponsors and associate sponsors during these summer months to help sustain the Bible Hour during these crucial days.
[time=854] If you would like to become a part of the Bible Hour Sponsors Club, we'd like to encourage you to write to us this week and let us know and we'll be happy to pass on to you the information and encourage you to be a part of us.
[time=866] We would say this that the associate sponsors are those who send $100 to help in the cost of the television ministry a few moments ago.
[time=875] I misspoke and said it was $100 a week.
[time=877] It would be great.
[time=878] I doubt very many people would be able to do that, but a gift of $100 toward the sponsorship of one particular program, and when you write and send your gift, please make sure that you know that you want to be an associate sponsor.
[time=890] Sometime in the future, we'll be sharing your name and your gift as a part of this ministry.
[time=896] We'll be giving you the address to write in just a few moments, but before we do that, honey, we need to say just a word about this book again.
[time=902] My father would really appreciate it if we had pushed this great book during these few days and let everyone know what a tremendous help it is to them in their own home.
[time=911] I think everyone that is rearing a family these days is looking for little helps that will guide them as they attempt to rear their children in a manner which would be pleasing to the Lord, and this booklet does just that.
[time=924] It has a number of helpful little chapters that tell you little insights on how you can more effectively rear your children.
[time=931] The title of the book is The Home That Stands, and the subtitle is Biblical Insights for Family Living.
[time=938] It was written by my father, Dr. James T. Jeremiah, who for 25 years was the president of Cedarville College.
[time=944] And we'd like to send this book into your home as our free gift to you this week if you'll write to us and request it.
[time=950] If you're writing about the sponsors program or you're writing to request this free booklet, please write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne,
[time=962] Indiana, 46815.
[time=965] Honey, it would be so good if we could hear from many of our friends during this summertime.
[time=969] For some reason, when people get informally involved with life and go on vacation, sometimes they forget about the needs we have on the Bible hour.
[time=978] This would be a great time for you to write to us if you've always thought someday I'm going to jot a note to the Bible hour and let them know what it means to me.
[time=986] If you've had that thought in times past and haven't done it, now would be a super time for you just to sit down and let us know that you're out there.
[time=993] Once again, let me encourage you when you write and request the booklet or information about the sponsors program or when you send your gift to become an associate sponsor.
[time=1003] Write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne,
[time=1009] Indiana, 46815.
[time=1011] We'll be looking forward to hearing from you this week, and we trust you'll do your letter writing to us this very day.
[time=1018] It's time now for us to get back to the morning service.
[time=1021] We trust you'll stay with us for the remaining portion of this program as we share with you the Word of God on the Bible hour.
[time=1028] Let's take our hymnals now and turn in them to 666 and sing
[time=1044] my Jesus, I love thee, hymn number 666.
[time=1050] Shall we stand together as we sing?
[time=1055] Make this your prayer this morning.
[time=1074] (Music)
[time=1105] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1108] There is not a one of us who is not born into the world
[time=1114] without the stains of sin.
[time=1116] But there is not a one of us in the world who cannot have those stains removed by Jesus Christ.
[time=1123] The Bible says whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1130] Ron and Dennis come and sing for us now.
[time=1132] The message that tells us Calvary covers it all.
[time=1137] (Music) (Music)
[time=1147] (Music) (Music) (Music)
[time=1153] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=1277] (Music)
[time=1292] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=1380] (Music)
[time=1400] How many of you can say that you're personally and experientially involved in the joy of the complete covering of Calvary for your sin?
[time=1410] Would you say amen?
[time=1412] And that song so wonderfully tells the story of redemption that we identify with as believers.
[time=1419] Now your Bibles are open to the 17th chapter of the book of John, John's Gospel, chapter 17.
[time=1432] This is one of those passages of Scripture that is so filled with truth that when you start to walk through it,
[time=1438] you wonder if you'll ever get to the other side.
[time=1441] Every phrase, every verse is so filled with suggestive instruction that it is a tremendous challenge to try to move through it at a pace
[time=1452] so that you accomplish the exposition of the passage in a reasonable length of time.
[time=1458] I want to promise you that as God is my helper, I do not plan to dwell on every phrase as we have last week and again today.
[time=1466] God has laid upon my heart the truth of these first few words in our Lord's Prayer,
[time=1473] and I want to read again just the first verse of John, chapter 17.
[time=1478] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,
[time=1486] Father, the hour is come, glorify thy son, that thy son also may glorify thee.
[time=1497] Shall we pray together?
[time=1500] Lord, we would pray as we have been praying in these last days that the Lord Jesus Christ would be lifted up and exalted
[time=1509] that men and women, boys and girls, young people would see him and him alone.
[time=1515] We thank the Our Father for his example to us, not only for his sacrificial death upon the cross,
[time=1523] but the example of his life and ministry, which has been left to us as a legacy for our faith,
[time=1530] that we may follow him, that we may walk after him, that we may become like him.
[time=1536] Today, as we examine the way in which he gives to us the key to life in pressured times,
[time=1544] we ask that you will speak to each of our hearts and cause us to be open, that God might do in our lives that work which he chooses to do.
[time=1553] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1559] Some time ago, the President of the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism, Dr. Wendell Kempton,
[time=1566] who was a personal friend of mine, sent to my desk a rendition of the 23rd Psalm that had been written by a Japanese Christian,
[time=1576] a young man by the name of Toki Mayashani from Japan.
[time=1582] This rendition of the 23rd Psalm is hanging on the wall of Dr. Kempton's office,
[time=1590] and it might well be hanging on the walls of all of our offices and certainly upon the wall of our minds
[time=1597] as we try to live in the culture that is our environment these days.
[time=1604] This is how it goes.
[time=1607] The Lord is my pace-setter. I shall not rush.
[time=1612] He makes me stop and rest for quiet intervals.
[time=1616] He provides me with images of stillness which restore my serenity.
[time=1622] He leads me in ways of efficiency through calmness of mind, and his guidance is peace.
[time=1629] Even though I have a great many things to accomplish each day, I will not fret for his presence is here.
[time=1638] His timelessness, his all-importance, will keep me in balance.
[time=1643] He prepares refreshment and renewal in the midst of my activity by anointing my mind with his oils of tranquility.
[time=1653] My cup of joyous energy overflows.
[time=1657] Surely harmony and effectiveness shall be the fruits of my hours, for I shall walk in the pace of my Lord and dwell in his house forever.
[time=1670] The 23rd Psalm for very busy people.
[time=1676] And how appropriate it is for our lives today.
[time=1680] I remember hearing a message of a dear colored pastor that I have admired, and he said to his congregation one day, "If there's anything else that you want me to do, I can't participate."
[time=1692] I understood what he was saying, and I think that somehow his words speak for all of us
[time=1698] as we look at the demands that are placed upon our lives in these busy, busy days.
[time=1705] If there's anything else that you want me to do, I can't participate.
[time=1710] As I have thought, as I am sure you think, about the pressures of the life that we live,
[time=1720] I have often been caused to wonder how our Lord accomplished what he did
[time=1726] for a short lifetime that his father allowed him to walk upon this earth.
[time=1731] I understand that he was the Son of God, the man of God, the God man, the God in the flesh.
[time=1739] I understand all of that, and yet I also understand that he came as a man in order that he might show us how to live, and in his life is the key to our lives.
[time=1749] In the way that he moved about in his schedule, there is a lesson for us to learn.
[time=1756] We need to understand that the Lord never equated activity with spirituality, nor the busyness of schedule with piety.
[time=1766] But somehow he moved through the course of his life in such a way that though he ministered to the needs of all around him, he never seemed to be in a hurry.
[time=1777] I was first turned to the thought of this in this 17th chapter of the book of John
[time=1783] when I read the word that concerns the time of his life.
[time=1789] The Scripture says in the 17th chapter verse 1 that he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour is come." And as I began to study that phrase, I learned that seven times in the Gospel of John
[time=1804] there is a reference to this particular hour.
[time=1808] And as I went back and examined and exhausted the truth and all of the references to this hour, in the book of John, I began to see some deep truth that related to the lifestyle of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1821] that is a transferable concept into where you and I are living today.
[time=1827] And so today, I want to take you through the passages in the book of John, each of them teaching us a particular lesson about our Lord's dealing with the pressure of his time
[time=1839] and the promise that he gives to us and the key that he gives to us for our lives in these days.
[time=1848] The first reference to this particular hour is in the second chapter of the Gospel of John.
[time=1854] It occurred at a wedding feast. It is the first miracle of Jesus at the marriage feast at Cana of Galilee.
[time=1864] And in the second chapter of the book of John, we read the first reference to this hour in our Lord's response to his own mother.
[time=1876] In John chapter 2, and we began reading at the first of the chapter, and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee,
[time=1884] and the mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage,
[time=1890] and when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, they have no wine.
[time=1896] Jesus saith unto her woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.
[time=1906] Now, when you look at that at first, it seems to have no relationship whatsoever to the story.
[time=1913] Why is it that Christ would refer to this hour? That is, Yonder mentioned in the 17th chapter of John when he was seeking just to respond to his own mother.
[time=1925] Why is it that he should reference the hour of his glorification, of his death and his resurrection when he was simply being told about the need for additional wine at the feast?
[time=1937] The hour to which he referred was the time when he would be subject to man's will.
[time=1944] When he would be delivered into the hands of sinners, that hour to which he refers was the time when the sinner's hands would take him and crucify him and put him to the cross.
[time=1955] But until then, he was not to be ordered by man. Instead, he was about his father's business seeking only to do his father's will.
[time=1967] In the Scofield Reference Bible, there is a note to this verse and it reads like this.
[time=1974] Scofield says that that particular phrase might be paraphrased as follows. Madam, that concerns you, not me, my hour is not yet come.
[time=1986] The first principle that I learned about our Lord's life is this, that when you live according to the schedule of God for your life, nothing, absolutely nothing can distract you.
[time=2001] There isn't anything wrong with the request to the Lord Jesus about the wine that was needed. But you see, the principle he was establishing was this.
[time=2011] That was a matter of earthly concern. He had something much greater upon his mind.
[time=2016] His face was set as a flint toward the cross and he was saying to his own mother, "Listen, that's a business that you ought to take care of.
[time=2024] My hour is not yet come. I'll not be detracted or deterred from the purpose that I have to be involved with mundane things.
[time=2032] I am setting my face toward the goal which God has for me."
[time=2039] One of the tremendous problems we face in our generation is the fact that it's so hard to keep our eyes and our purposes and our wills focused and attached to the goal which God has set before us.
[time=2051] There are hundreds of things trying to take us off the track. We chase rabbits in every direction.
[time=2057] Somehow, we never seem to get back in the same sense of momentum that we had before.
[time=2063] God would teach us through the life of his son, the Lord Jesus, that he has a perfect plan for our lives.
[time=2069] That plan not only includes the goal, but it includes the timetable.
[time=2074] And it is our responsibility as Christians not only to understand God's will for us, but to understand the timetable and the schedule that he has set before us.
[time=2085] And yet, within all of that, there is a sense of serenity that the Lord evidenced in the way he conducted his business on that schedule.
[time=2094] That you just got the impression as you observed his life, that he knew what he was doing.
[time=2100] He knew what the Father wanted him to do, and he would not be distracted from that, even for a moment.
[time=2106] There's a beautiful illustration of this in the life of our Lord and his dealing with Lazarus.
[time=2111] If you have your Bibles turned to the 11th chapter of the book of John, John chapter 11, you know the story of Lazarus's sickness and his death.
[time=2124] How the Lord was encouraged to come and raise, to deal with Lazarus's sickness, and we read in John chapter 11 verse 6 these words.
[time=2136] When Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he jumped on his donkey and rode at breakneck speed to get there just in time.
[time=2147] No, that's the way we would respond, but that's not the way the Lord responded.
[time=2152] The Scripture says, when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
[time=2160] Lord, that's not the way you respond in the ministry.
[time=2163] I don't understand your lack of urgency as it relates to the needs of a man.
[time=2170] And yet, we learned later on in the text in verse 11 that Jesus had all of this in his heart and in his mind from God the Father.
[time=2181] These things said he, and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
[time=2188] And the disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps he does well, however Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
[time=2197] And then in verse 14 then said, Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that you may believe.
[time=2206] You see, God had already communicated to his son Christ that it was in the plan of God for Lazarus to be the object of God's authority in the person of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2216] And knowing the plan, he could respond to the emergency around him in serenity and in calmness, and though there was a tremendously important thing happening, he waited two days, because he not only knew the goal and the plan, but he had the timetable in mind.
[time=2235] Men and women, let me say this to you, when you come to grips with God's will for your life and his schedule in your life, nothing will distract you.
[time=2243] All the problems around need to be dealt with, but there is a goal out there that God has for you, and you will keep your eyes upon that goal, and you will walk toward it, and you will take things and stride as they come by the grace of God, but you will keep marching toward the goal.
[time=2259] The second reference to the hour to which we have referred is found twice in the book of John, first of all in the seventh chapter in verse 30, and then again in the eighth chapter and verse 20.
[time=2273] John chapter 7 verse 30.
[time=2278] Here we read that the unbelieving multitudes who would crucify the Lord sought to take him.
[time=2285] Verse 30 says, "And they sought to take him, but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come." Notice chapter 8 and verse 20.
[time=2297] These words spoke Jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come.
[time=2307] The first principle of the Lord's life which we ought to emulate is this one.
[time=2312] When we live according to God's schedule for our lives, nothing can distract us.
[time=2318] The second principle is this.
[time=2320] When we live according to God's schedule for our lives, nothing can destroy us.
[time=2326] Nothing can get to us.
[time=2328] Oh, here were the enemies all around the Lord trying to reach out and take him, but what does the Scripture say?
[time=2335] They couldn't touch him because it wasn't God's time.
[time=2340] They couldn't take him because it wasn't in the schedule of God for him to be taken at that time.
[time=2346] What a tremendous thing it is as a Christian to know that the times of my life are in the hands of an almighty God.
[time=2355] When I first started to travel and to go out into preach and speak in other places, and as God has enabled me to do that and I began to fly, I felt within my heart almost a syndrome developing.
[time=2372] When I would get on the plane and it was leaving, this was before the recent tragedy in Chicago.
[time=2377] This was a long time before that.
[time=2379] I would get on the plane and as the plane would taxi out to the runway, my heart and my mind, my thoughts would be filled with my wife and my children.
[time=2389] Almost to the point where I was developing a fear of doing that, for fear that something would happen and I wouldn't come back, and what would happen to them.
[time=2397] And then one day, God gripped me with this fact.
[time=2401] My times are in His hands.
[time=2404] My life is in His hands. The day of my death is known to God, and He's in charge of it, and I can't change it.
[time=2413] If I stay in the center of God's will, there isn't anything I can do to affect a change as it relates to my life, my ministry, what God has called me to do.
[time=2423] And there was a sense of serenity and relaxation that came to me when I recognized that if I'm in the will of God and I'm walking according to the schedule of God for my life, nothing.
[time=2433] Nothing can destroy me.
[time=2437] I remember reading about Peter in jail over in the 12th chapter of the book of Acts, one of my favorite stories.
[time=2444] And I never ceased to be amazed at how that man could go to sleep the night before he was to be executed.
[time=2449] The Scripture says he was sleeping between two guards. Tomorrow his head would roll, but he was asleep.
[time=2454] Now Peter was known for sleeping at some very inappropriate times, like on the Mount of Transfiguration and outside of the Garden of Gethsemane and a few other places.
[time=2462] But here was a sleep of Peter, which was a tremendous testimony to his faith, and then I began to read and think, and I remembered something.
[time=2472] I remembered that there had been a time, it's over in the book of John in the very last part of the book, when God said to Peter, "Peter, you're going to be an old man, and they're going to be carrying you about in your old age."
[time=2486] I like to paraphrase it, propping you up in the pulpit to preach.
[time=2492] You know why Peter could go to sleep?
[time=2494] John in that jail?
[time=2496] Because God had told him that his hour had not come.
[time=2499] He had told him that he would live to be a man of old age, to minister, and so in the light of that truth for his life, there was a serenity and a peace about his life and about his situation.
[time=2514] Men and women, one of the things that will bring us out of the frenzied pace and frustration of the generation in which we live is to get back to a realization that God in heaven has a plan for our lives.
[time=2525] Our job is to find that plan, get in the center of it, and then leave the result of that plan to him.
[time=2532] When the time comes and he's ready for it, there isn't anything we can do to change it, and that's not a fatalistic approach to life, that's a spiritual approach to life.
[time=2543] The third reference that I want to share with you in relationship to the hour of Christ is found in the 12th chapter of the book of John.
[time=2553] Actually it's the fourth, if you put the other two together it's the third, but John chapter 12 verse 27.
[time=2562] Jesus said, "Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour, but for this cause came I unto this hour."
[time=2579] And I would share with you thirdly by way of principle that when you live according to God's schedule for your life, nothing can discourage you.
[time=2591] Here the Lord is wrestling within his own heart.
[time=2596] This is the beginning of the Savior's travail, it is sort of a pre-Gethseman experience.
[time=2601] It is very similar to that which we read about when we read that he struggled and said, "Let this cup pass from me, but nevertheless not my will, but dine be done."
[time=2612] It is a time of inward suffering in the Lord's life, a time of torture and grief of travail and dejection.
[time=2619] The Scripture says he has troubled.
[time=2623] It was the prospect in his own mind of being made a curse for sin that caused him to so struggle inwardly.
[time=2631] But I want you to notice that he did not say, "What shall I choose?" For the choice had already been made, he said, "What shall I say?"
[time=2642] He was struggling inwardly. In the midst of his inward anguish he bowed to the will of his father, though he recognized all that he would face.
[time=2652] Yet he was not discouraged by that because he knew that for this hour he had been brought into the world.
[time=2663] He had a sense of purpose in his life that caused him to face even the anguish and difficulty, yes, and human discouragement that he must have felt as he faced the awful weight of sin that he would bear for us on the cross.
[time=2679] And yet the thing that held him to it when he looked deathfully in the face and he bowed to it was the fact that but for this purpose came I into this hour.
[time=2691] Men and women, there's not anything I know that will so solidify your life is the sense of God's purpose at work in your life.
[time=2700] The realization that God has a thing for you to do that he has chosen for you to do, the sense of an almighty assignment that's been given to you.
[time=2710] And when God gives you that assignment that he gives you the grace and the strength and yes the fortitude and the defense for discouragement that goes with it because God's commandments are his enablements.
[time=2722] And you can stand in the midst of struggle inwardly and outwardly and say I know it's all happening in here and out there but for this hour came I into this place.
[time=2733] And every Christian no matter how great or small their place of ministry ought to have that kind of sense of destiny as they face the challenges.
[time=2745] And can't you see what that does to the world in which we live and its pressures upon us it is the strength that comes from within that controls the situation instead of the frenzy from without that controls it.
[time=2759] I hasten on to number four when you live according to God's schedule for your life nothing can disappoint you.
[time=2771] Turn with me to the sixteenth chapter and verse thirty two.
[time=2783] Here again he references this hour, this hour of destiny, this hour of the cross.
[time=2791] Behold the hour cometh, yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone.
[time=2803] And yet I am not alone because the father is with me.
[time=2808] Jesus here refers to the time when his disciples would walk away from him.
[time=2815] The scripture says in the account of the crucifixion that there was a time when they walk no longer with him.
[time=2820] As he came closer and closer to the cross to the the ignomene, the suffering, the humiliation of the cross experience his disciples gradually began to fall away so that no man stood with him.
[time=2837] Here he prophesies that in his divine perspective of the cross Jesus knew that when the heat was on his disciples would leave and the scripture says they were scattered and gone.
[time=2852] Oh what a terribly disappointing and humanly discouraging thing that must have been to the manhood of Christ.
[time=2860] Here these who he had built into their lives the principles of faith these to whom he had spoken over and over again about trusting in God the Father those to whom he had demonstrated what faith was all about in the boat at night and all of the experiences of his miracles.
[time=2877] And yet in the hour of need in the hour of his greatest trial there was no man that stood with him they were all scattered.
[time=2884] It would not have anything to do with him.
[time=2889] There is not a person in this room or who hears my voice that in some time in your life there will be the sensation that I have described as it relates to some particular problem or difficulty that you face.
[time=2902] There are all kinds of senses that we feel that are akin to what I've just described sometimes it's through a personal sickness sometimes it's through a struggling mentally or emotionally sometimes it is through the problems that other people bring into your life sometimes it's family difficulties.
[time=2922] And what is it that happens to us when those things come?
[time=2926] I know the temptation that I face when I know what God's purpose for my life is in those struggles come and I sense the aloneness that comes with the position of leadership or the aloneness that comes with the problems that we sometimes face.
[time=2944] The temptation is to lose sight of the goal and start to deal with all of the difficulties of aloneness and all of the difficulties and the problems and forget that God is a purpose that is central and that supersedes all of these difficulties.
[time=2960] Some of the things that God has taught me through this passage that we're looking at right now is this that if we live according to God's schedule there ought to be nothing that can ultimately and finally disappoint us.
[time=2977] As you see the nature of my joy the nature of my feeling good about myself as a Christian and as a pastor and as a leader is not related to how many people are excited about it even though that may seem to be important to others.
[time=2993] The nature of my feeling good about what God is doing in my life and in the ministry of the place where I serve is this.
[time=3000] Am I on target for the will of God?
[time=3003] Are we headed in the direction God wants us to go?
[time=3006] And if that's true, if I know what God's will for me is, what is goal for me is?
[time=3012] And people who don't always understand it, thank God there are many who do but some who don't, you don't have to be disappointed notice what he said.
[time=3023] He said they're all going to leave, they're going to be scattered every man to his own and then he said and they shall leave me alone and I love the rest of it.
[time=3035] And yet I am not alone, why? Because the Father is with me.
[time=3044] You see there's a wonderful sense in the will of God, of the presence of God.
[time=3050] Do you understand the relationship there?
[time=3054] When you can look up into the face of heaven, examining your own motives, thinking about your own perspectives.
[time=3061] You're recognizing your weaknesses and your strengths but you see through all of that and you can say as honestly as you know how God, this is your will for my life and the best I know how I'm trying to live in the midst of it.
[time=3073] There is a wonderful sense of the presence of God in the midst of that.
[time=3079] You may be going through some suffering in your life, you don't understand it but you know sometimes when you experience suffering, God can give you a sense of awareness that this is his will for your life.
[time=3090] And though you don't like it, and though the pain still is there and it hurts, and the trauma is all a part that you experience, yet the knowledge that it is the will of God for you brings with it an overwhelming sense of God's presence with you in the midst of that situation.
[time=3108] That's why I had Pastor Rick read a passage for us some time ago, a few moments ago from the 13th chapter of the book of Hebrews.
[time=3117] Let me remind you of the truth of that section of Scripture.
[time=3120] Let your manner of life be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for.
[time=3127] He hath said, I will never leave you nor forsake you, so that we may boldly say, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
[time=3139] When you are living on the schedule of God for your life, you don't have to be disappointed.
[time=3147] I have to be honest with you that when I get disappointed it's because I forget who I'm serving.
[time=3154] When I get disappointed or discouraged it's because I forget just for a moment what I'm supposed to be doing, who I report to.
[time=3167] Then when I remember that I report to God and that He's in charge of my life and I'm responsible to Him and obviously to those that He's put into the structure of leadership within the organization where we are, what a thrilling thing it is to know that you don't have to be disappointed.
[time=3184] God didn't say that everybody should always understand everything.
[time=3188] He said it's important for us to walk in the center of His will.
[time=3193] When you live according to God's schedule for your life, nothing need disappoint you.
[time=3199] Oh, you say, preacher, that's the ideal, I know it, but it's the goal for which we should be striving.
[time=3205] Last but not least, we come to the passage with which we began.
[time=3209] When you live according to God's schedule, first of all, nothing can distract you.
[time=3215] Secondly, nothing can destroy you.
[time=3218] Thirdly, nothing can discourage you.
[time=3222] Fourthly, nothing can disappoint you.
[time=3227] Last but not least, when you live according to God's schedule, nothing can defeat you.
[time=3232] John chapter 17 and verse 1 is the culmination of all of the previous ones that we've looked at.
[time=3239] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour is come."
[time=3246] This same reference is found in the 12th chapter of John in verse 23.
[time=3250] What hour is He talking about?
[time=3252] It is the hour when the Son of Man was to end His labors of life by death.
[time=3257] It was the hour when the Lord of glory was to be made sin for man that all mankind might be able to be saved.
[time=3265] It was the hour when all prophecy of the Old Testament was to be fulfilled.
[time=3270] It was the hour when the Son would refuse to shine and when the earth would rock upon its axis.
[time=3276] It was the hour when death would be swallowed up in victory.
[time=3280] It was the hour to which all history before looked and toward which all history afterward looks back.
[time=3289] It was the hour of triumph and glory, the hour of victory in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=3298] and in the life of every Christian who has ever come to know Him.
[time=3303] And one of the most overwhelming statements that has ever been spoken by a man to walk upon this earth was spoken by our Lord shortly after this.
[time=3313] For when He came to this hour and He experienced it, we read in verse 4 that He said, "I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do.
[time=3326] O, to be so attuned to the plan of God, and so on schedule with your divine leader
[time=3333] that when you come to the end of your life you can say, "Lord, I've kept the schedule and I've done what you've wanted me to do."
[time=3342] Men and women, there's enough time in our lives to do the will of God.
[time=3346] If we stay on course and on schedule, we can walk through the frenzied pace of this life
[time=3354] and have a sense of peace and serenity that the world will never understand, but we'll try to copy.
[time=3364] Shall we pray?
[time=3369] Father, we thank You for this portion of Scripture which started our thoughts back through the life of the Lord Jesus to the expressions of His commitment to the schedule of God.
[time=3383] And just as You had a timetable for Him, You have one for us, help us to be sensitive to it.
[time=3392] And not to be impatient, not to run ahead, not to lag behind, but just every day, day by day, to walk in the plan for our lives that day.
[time=3409] We know that if we put all of the days together in the center of the will of God, we will ultimately arrive at the place God wants us to be.
