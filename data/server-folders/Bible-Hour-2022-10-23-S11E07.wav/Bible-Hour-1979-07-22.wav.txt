[time=0] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=9] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=30] And all God's people said, "And you may be seated."
[time=49] With the singing of that hymn of praise, we began the worship service of the Black Hawk
[time=58] Baptist Church, and this is the part of the service that we share with all of our many
[time=64] friends via television, here in Fort Wayne and in Indianapolis and South Bend and Chicago,
[time=71] and in Peoria, Illinois, and out in the West Coast in Redwood, California.
[time=78] And we're grateful for the privilege God has given us of opening the doors of the sanctuary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and inviting our many friends to share with us.
[time=87] We're in the midst of the very best summer we've ever had in the history of this church, and we're so grateful to God for what He's been doing among us, both individually and as a church, and it's a great thing to look out over the congregation in the midst of July here in Indiana and see the pews, the seats filled with people who've come to share
[time=109] the Word of God and the blessing of the Lord.
[time=111] We're grateful for your presence here, and we trust this service will be a meaningful opportunity for you to grow and be enriched in the things of the Lord.
[time=120] Our choir is going to continue our worship before God today as they sing for us a song
[time=126] entitled "Crown Him with Many Crowns."
[time=146] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=302] And when they gather around the throne in glory to sing praise unto the Lord, it must be something like that that they sing.
[time=310] During the summertime we're happy for the many folks who come to visit us from the areas
[time=316] where the Bible Hour is seen over the past few weeks.
[time=319] We have greeted at the door of the church people from Chicago and all of the communities surrounding Fort Wayne and South Bend and Indianapolis, and it's a good time for you to come and visit with us, and you're always welcome.
[time=331] We want you to know that.
[time=332] We extend to all of you who are visiting with us today the sincerest welcome, and I trust that the spirit of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and her people will be felt in your own heart as you worship with us today.
[time=345] Music is very much a part of our ministry.
[time=347] It is not a prelude to the ministry.
[time=349] It is a part of it, and we're so grateful to God for the many talented people that He has given to us.
[time=355] We don't have any hired musicians, we just have the people that God has committed to music who are part of this fellowship, and what a joy it has been for me as a pastor to watch them grow and develop in their ministry and in their ability to share the gospel through
[time=370] this beautiful medium of music.
[time=372] One of our very favorite soloists is Marilyn Wong, and she's going to sing to us now about
[time=378] the love of God.
[time=398] Oh, how He loves you and me, He gave His life what more could He give.
[time=426] Oh, how He loves you, Oh, how He loves me, Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=446] Jesus, to Calvary, did God, His love for sinners to show, what He did there brought
[time=475] and how He loved you, Oh, how He loves me, Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=503] Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=515] Oh, how He loves you and me, He gave the love that He died for me, Oh, how He loves you,
[time=543] Oh, how He loves me, Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=557] Oh, how He loves you, Oh, how He loves me, Oh, how He loves you and me.
[time=586] You and me.
[time=608] Thank you again for being a part of the Bible Hour today and for joining us on this special segment of this television program, allowing us the privilege of sitting down beside you there in your living room and talking with you about the personal matters that affect the ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour television program.
[time=625] Donna, this is one of the special times that we have together with all of our friends who watch by television, and it seems as if in recent days we've come much closer to many of these people because of their involvement with us in this ministry.
[time=641] A number of people in recent days have requested the privilege of sponsoring the Bible Hour
[time=647] in their area for a particular Sunday, and we have two people who are associate sponsors
[time=653] today.
[time=654] We have Bessie Brown from Fort Wayne, and she watches it on Channel 21, and she's also
[time=660] a Faithful Founders Club member, so we have a double thank you to say to her, and also
[time=667] another associate sponsor today is Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Eloff, and they are from Roanoke and they also watched on 21.
[time=675] Donna, this week we will be sending to each of these folks this beautiful certificate, which will be a frameable certificate, reminding them in the days ahead of the ministry they've
[time=688] had today in sponsoring the Bible Hour, and literally preaching the gospel to hundreds of thousands of people here in this area.
[time=695] Mr. and Mrs. Eloff and Bessie Brown will both receive these in the mail, and it will be a reminder to them that they've helped us today to get the word of the Lord out through this television ministry.
[time=707] I want to express my personal thanks to both of these people and to the many others who have written to us recently, and have asked to be a part of the ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=717] If you are interested in being an associate sponsor, or perhaps being a sponsor of the
[time=723] entire program here in this area or in any of the areas where it is seen, if you will sit down and write to us today, we'll be happy to send to you the information so that you can know how to become a part of this growing team of ministers who help us reach out with the word of God.
[time=738] Thank you ever so much for your continued support, and I trust that we'll continue to hear from many more of you in the days ahead.
[time=745] Some time ago we started to promote the importance of gospel literature through this program,
[time=752] and I would hate to guess how many books we have sent out to people who have requested them all over this area in Chicago, South Bend, Indiana, Fort Wayne, and for a while in Syracuse, and the testimony that we receive back from those who receive the special booklets
[time=768] that we prepare and send to them is one of an ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=774] I suppose the most exciting one that we've had in recent years was a little concordance that we sent out to people to help them find special places in the Bible.
[time=783] Now we have something new and different and even more exciting that we have put together here in the Bible Hour Office, especially for our many friends.
[time=791] Donna, it's called the answer book, and why would we call it that?
[time=795] We call it the answer book because it is that.
[time=798] It has the answers to many questions that you have, for instance, there are sections on guilt
[time=804] and on forgiveness, and if you have a question about that particular topic, you can look in the book and find the scripture reference and find it written out for you.
[time=813] And it is the answer that really makes a difference, you know, we can go many places today and find answers.
[time=819] Someone always has a suggested answer, but the answer book has the answer because it is
[time=825] nothing more than the reproduction of the Word of God on a topical order so that when you
[time=831] look through the book, you will come to a page on faith, and here will be the key passages in the Word of God printed out on that subject.
[time=839] If you struggle with the problem of loneliness, here is a page with all of the verses, the key verses in the Bible on loneliness.
[time=846] If you have a problem with guilt, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=849] You can go through the book, find the problem you're dealing with, and there are the scriptures that will help you without comment, without commentary, just the plain, unadulterated Word of God.
[time=860] And it's a nice size too, isn't it?
[time=861] Yes, it would be very convenient to put it in the front of your Bible or leave it by
[time=867] your phone if you have an opportunity to do counseling, it would be just a handy little booklet to have.
[time=873] And if you would like to have a copy of it, we would urge you to write to us, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, just tell us that
[time=887] you would like a copy of the answer book, and we will put one in the mail to you by return mail.
[time=892] Now to the thing that I'm excited about with this little booklet is that it is the right size to put in your Bible to carry with you.
[time=899] You can also slip it in the inside pocket of a suit coat, and most women that I know have purses large enough for it to slip inside the purse and carry it with you wherever you go.
[time=908] You may not always be able to carry the entire Word of God with you, but you can carry this with you, and you will find it to be helpful just to read through these selected passages each day.
[time=917] Once again, we'd like the privilege of sending to you this week your own personal copy of the answer book.
[time=923] It is not available any place else.
[time=925] It has been put together specifically for this television ministry, and we want to send it to you this week.
[time=931] If you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television, we appreciate it.
[time=935] But if you can't do that, we'd like to send it to you free and postage paid just the same.
[time=940] Once again, when you request the answer book, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=951] Thank you for being a part of this ministry, and may God continue to richly bless you as you share the remainder of today's program.
[time=961] [MUSIC]
[time=984] While we continue to take the offering, turn in your hymnos to hymn number 16, and we're going to sing the song Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise, hymn number 16.
[time=997] We'll remain seated as we sing, everyone together.
[time=1003] In your holy place, all the holy Christ is my hymn and sombre. In the heart of the present, the Lord of the great and the brave.
[time=1025] O my hymn, glorious, my hymn, we pray, O'er the resting eyes of the holy Christ, you come, we sing, all the same.
[time=1048] [MUSIC]
[time=1067] And thank you for that good singing, that's a different hymn, but we're going to have to sing that again and learn it real well.
[time=1074] David was the man who sinned, and because of the sorrow that was put in his heart and repentance, he wrote these words.
[time=1084] He said, "Cast me not away from my presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[time=1090] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with the willing spirit."
[time=1097] Listen now as the Black Hawk Singers sing those words, "Restore to me the joy of thy salvation."
[time=1108] As I had everything, all the joy life could bring, each day I lived, I learned to talk with you,
[time=1131] leaving you, loving you.
[time=1141] My faith was firm and strong, learning right, hearing wrong,
[time=1154] but now is not the way it used to be, something's changed inside of me.
[time=1172] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[time=1184] Restore to me the joy of each new day.
[time=1197] He give me back the love that I once had for you, and never, ever let me slip away.
[time=1228] I used to speak your words through my lips, your voice has heard.
[time=1241] There were so many, then who came my way, I could help find the way.
[time=1260] But now my words are cold, joy has gone, love is old, and love because I try to live alone.
[time=1280] Bring me back, take me home.
[time=1289] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[time=1300] Restore to me the joy of each new day.
[time=1313] Give me back the love that I once had for you, and never, ever let me slip away.
[time=1336] Jesus, how I need you every day.
[time=1358] The prayer of David is a prayer that is available to anyone of God's children who has fallen
[time=1364] out of fellowship with the Lord.
[time=1366] David didn't pray restore my salvation.
[time=1369] He prayed restore the joy of my salvation.
[time=1372] All of us who at any one time in our lives have experienced what it means to be backslidden know that when the joy of your salvation goes, it's a very miserable time.
[time=1382] But God waits with open arms ready to receive back into fellowship those who will call upon him
[time=1388] and pray the simple prayer of the psalm we've just heard.
[time=1392] Some will do it today by his grace.
[time=1396] In the morning paper, there is a tribute by one of the local political figures who was
[time=1403] present in our annual patriotic panorama to the ministry of music that was shared here
[time=1409] a few weeks ago.
[time=1411] And in the article that was submitted to the letters to the editor section, they made a comment about the fact that one of the special things about that night was the fact that it was a presentation of the music of Mr. Bill Gaither.
[time=1425] And then the article said of all the music that is available in the gospel caliber today,
[time=1433] perhaps Bill Gaither's music is the most representative of truly American music because he's an American composer
[time=1441] and he is written from the very heart of where most of us live.
[time=1445] Before the message this morning, David Miller is going to sing the song that probably catapulted Bill Gaither into the limelight of musical prominence and one that most of us are very familiar with
[time=1457] and I hope we have experienced it.
[time=1459] The song is entitled "He Touched Me."
[time=1480] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=1621] Thank you, David. Will you open your Bibles this morning to the 17th chapter of the book of John, John chapter 17?
[time=1633] And I want to read for our study together today, the first five verses of the 17th chapter.
[time=1641] But once again we will meditate upon a very small portion
[time=1647] of this high priestly prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1652] John chapter 17 verses 1 through 5 and this is what we read in that section of scripture.
[time=1659] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy son, that thy son also may glorify thee."
[time=1671] Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[time=1677] And this is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.
[time=1685] I have glorified thee on the earth. I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do.
[time=1691] And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
[time=1700] Shall we pray?
[time=1702] Father, we ask that you will give us insight in our discussion of this important section of thy word.
[time=1710] As we contemplate the subject of the glory of God, as exhibited in the life of his son Jesus Christ,
[time=1719] and this petition from the lips of the Savior, we recognize that it is not just for our information that this word has been given unto us, but that it is also for our instruction in life.
[time=1733] And the practical applications of thy word must be taken to heart if we are to glean from it the benefit for which it was given.
[time=1742] And so we ask that you will open our hearts to the ministry of the Holy Spirit as he illuminates our minds and hearts with this truth today,
[time=1750] for we pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1757] The great writer, C.S. Lewis, when writing on the subject of glory before his conversion made the following statement,
[time=1768] he wrote, "Glory suggests two ideas to me of which one seems wicked and the other quite ridiculous.
[time=1780] Neither glory means to me fame or it means luminosity. As for the first, sense to be famous means to be better known than other people,
[time=1790] the desire for fame appears to me as a competitive passion and therefore of hell rather than heaven.
[time=1797] As for the second luminosity, who wishes to become a kind of living electric light bulb?"
[time=1805] That was C.S. Lewis's comment on glory.
[time=1809] Little did he know that later on in his life he would become just that, a living electric light bulb for the glory which God has given to man upon this earth is nothing more than the reflected glory of the Son of God in our lives.
[time=1826] And God is asking every one of us to be the lights of the world as we reflect the light of the Lord Jesus Christ in our life
[time=1836] and glorify God through our personal existence.
[time=1841] It is interesting that in the prayer of our Lord to his Father, this most intimate portion of God's Word,
[time=1848] the first actual request in the prayer is a prayer that he might glorify the Father and that he himself might be glorified of God.
[time=1858] In the first verse we read these words. These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,
[time=1865] "Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee."
[time=1873] There are seven petitions in the Word of God and this is the first and it is filled with great and holy truth for our lives today.
[time=1884] Now there are two aspects to our Savior's prayer and those two aspects are alluded to in verses 4 and 5 of this text.
[time=1894] In verse 4 he talks about being glorified on the earth and in verse 5 he talks about being glorified in heaven
[time=1904] with the glory he had with him before the world was.
[time=1908] So in his prayer the Lord Jesus is talking about a two-fold glorification that he might be glorified in the earth in his personal ministry
[time=1918] in behalf of mankind and that he might experience that ultimate glory that would be his when he would be seated on the right hand of the Father in heaven.
[time=1928] The two aspects of our Lord's prayer request are also found in the 12th chapter of the book of John and by way of instruction let us turn back there
[time=1937] and notice the same two aspects of the glory of Christ in John chapter 12 verses 27 and 28.
[time=1950] And this is what we read.
[time=1952] Now is my soul troubled and what shall I say? Father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour.
[time=1961] Father glorify thy name.
[time=1964] Then came their voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
[time=1974] The past and the present, the earthly glory and the heavenly glory. That's the prayer that our Savior prayed that he might be glorified now and that he might be glorified in the future.
[time=1987] Now Christ's estimation of his own glorification was to accomplish his Father's will on the cross.
[time=1996] If I were to ask every one of you today to give a definition of the glory of Christ I am certain that most of us would omit the passion experience of Jesus.
[time=2006] We do not look upon his death on the cross as a glorifying experience and yet in the mind and heart of Jesus in his prayer to the Father for glorification
[time=2017] he had only one thing in mind and that was his death upon the cross, his attendant resurrection and his ascension to the Father on high.
[time=2025] That is why this prayer request is coupled with the time sequence words the hour is come.
[time=2031] What hour is he talking about?
[time=2033] He is talking about the hour when he would go to the cross and there culminate all the hopes and desires of mankind since the Garden of Eden
[time=2041] that the sin question would be solved and in that moment though from the human standpoint it looks like an awful moment,
[time=2048] a terrible moment, a travesty of justice in that moment Jesus understood that he would be glorified as he had never been glorified before.
[time=2058] For you see in the mind of the Lord Jesus Christ glorification was simply completing and fulfilling the will of God for his life and he was not misunderstanding that will.
[time=2070] For from the very beginning when he set his foot upon planet earth he recognized that he came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
[time=2082] He understood that the hour of greatest glory in his life would be the hour when he would suffer and die upon the cross and complete the plan of redemption for all mankind.
[time=2095] I could not help but think that even though we look at that from the human perspective and we see him hanging there bleeding and suffering with the crown of thorns upon his head
[time=2105] and the ignominious cries of the crowd being hurled upon him and we say that was an awful hour in history yet in the midst of the awfulness there are glimpses even of human glory which we can see.
[time=2118] Do you not remember in the story of the crucifixion that it was at that hour that Satan was bruised and was rendered in operative.
[time=2128] My fellow Christians men and women the hour when Satan was destroyed in terms of his power over all mankind was an hour of great glory not only for Christ but for this world as well.
[time=2141] Do you remember in the story of the crucifixion that it was there that the wages of sin were fully paid and when the Lord cried out it is finished and the debt was cancelled against our sin was that not an hour of great glory for all of mankind.
[time=2159] Do you not remember that it was here that the one who had power of death and hell was put aside in terms of his grasp and grip upon all men.
[time=2169] Do you not understand that it was at that hour that death was swallowed up in victory.
[time=2174] Do you not comprehend that that moment which looks to us to be a tragedy was a moment of glory because Jesus died to rise again and to die no more and to provide for you and for me the opportunity of resurrection of life.
[time=2190] When that moment came on the cross and the penalty was paid that was an hour of glory. We see it through human eyes and it seems so different.
[time=2201] We look at it through the eyes of the Savior and we see even in humanity that it was a time of great glory.
[time=2211] That was the glorification of the Lord Jesus upon this earth. When he dealt sin it's awful blow and when he opened up the corridors of heaven so that you and I could enter freely if we would put our trust in him, that was glory as far as Christ was concerned.
[time=2229] That was the glory upon the earth and the Bible tells us that the veil was rent into. The Bible tells us that a centurion who stood by commented in the midst of that tragedy this is truly the Son of God.
[time=2246] The Bible tells us that at that moment of glory the veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom and was totally opened up so that the way into the holy of holies would be made available to all mankind.
[time=2262] It was a glorious time even though it looked like a time of tragedy. But I want to talk with you for just a moment about the other glory that he anticipated.
[time=2273] This Savior requesting that he might be glorified with the glory he had from the beginning was a looking beyond the cross and beyond the resurrection and beyond the ascension to the moment when he would be enthroned in heaven.
[time=2287] And the Bible says that he would one day be enthroned at the right hand of God and crowned as the head of the church and that in his place on this earth the Holy Spirit would be sent as another comforter like unto the first and he would put all enemies under his feet.
[time=2304] If you have your Bibles with you turn to the book of Ephesians and in the book of Ephesians we have a reference to the power that was involved in such a glorification to come. Ephesians chapter 1 verses 20 to 23.
[time=2320] And this is what we read from the writings of Paul which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body.
[time=2348] The fullness of him that filth all in all.
[time=2351] The Bible says that after his glorification at the cross and his resurrection glory he ascended back into heaven and he was welcomed back into the place of authority and he was seated at the right hand of God.
[time=2365] And God the Father said to him you are now in the place of authority and all enemies are under thy feet now at the head of the church and he now reigns in glory.
[time=2375] So he has understood the reality of that prayer request that he offered that he might be glorified.
[time=2383] But I want to take you yonder to one further experience in the glorification of Christ and in the answer to this prayer request that was his to that passage of Scripture in the book of Philippians chapter 2 verses 9 through 11.
[time=2396] It is a familiar portion to us but it looks forward to a future day when God will glorify absolutely and perfectly his own son Jesus Christ.
[time=2408] For we read in verse 9 of chapter 2 where for God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that is his present glorified position.
[time=2419] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2433] And when will that happen men and women there is coming a day when Jesus will realize the final answer to this prayer that he be glorified.
[time=2441] The Bible tells us there is coming a day in the future when every knee shall bow before him and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord the tongues that have cursed him.
[time=2452] The tongues that have spoken against him, the tongues that have railed out against him, those tongues shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2463] We have a commercial that we watch occasionally on television. I can't even remember what it's for but the punchline is you can pay me now or pay me later.
[time=2473] And every time I see that commercial I think of this passage of Scripture. God has given to us the opportunity to bow before him and to confess his name now.
[time=2483] We can come as would be Christians and acknowledge him as our Savior and say he is worthy of our praise and thrown him in the lives of our heart and we can bow before him as it were now.
[time=2496] But men and women if we don't do it now someday we'll do it. For the Bible says there is coming a day when the glorified son shall receive the praise of every creature that he has ever brought into being and all mankind shall with one accord acknowledge that he is Savior.
[time=2513] But alas for some who have waited beyond the day of grace it will be too late to live in the presence of that glorified one for they will acknowledge that he is king against their own will.
[time=2527] That is what this prayer means. Jesus said oh Father glorify thy son at the cross at the resurrection and ultimately in glory and finally and absolutely before all mankind glorify thy son with the glory that was his before the foundation of the world.
[time=2550] Now this was the Savior requesting that the Father would support him on the cross and then bring him up from the grave and set him at the right hand of the Father and ultimately and wonderfully glorify him forever.
[time=2570] What does this mean to you and what does it mean to me that the Savior prayed that he might be glorified and that he might glorify the Father.
[time=2581] It seems to me that there are three lessons that are suggested from this simple prayer.
[time=2587] First of all there is a lesson here for suffering Christians. Is it not interesting that at the moment of his great agony and at the beginning of this prayer he looks beyond the suffering of the cross to the glory that would follow.
[time=2605] Christ's glory must have certainly been the comfort which he experienced in his awful hour of agony.
[time=2614] The realization that death was not the end but just the beginning and the opening up of the glorious doors of future existence with his Father.
[time=2622] It was the glory beyond the suffering that so ministered to the heart of the Savior. Isn't it interesting in the New Testament how many times we find reigning and glory associated with suffering and trouble.
[time=2635] If we suffer with him says Paul we shall also reign with him.
[time=2641] May I say to you today those of you who may be experiencing suffering in your own life the Bible tells us that in this veil of tears in this world in which we live we are going to experience the tribulations and sorrows that are common to humans.
[time=2656] We're going to have difficult times we're going to have deep times times that pull our soul apart and what is it that should bring to us comfort and encouragement in such an hour as this.
[time=2669] My mind goes over to the book of 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians 4 where Paul in writing to the Corinthian church compared these two things that were present in the prayer of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and in 2 Corinthians 4 verses 16 through 18 he says this to the Corinthians about suffering and about glory.
[time=2695] He says for which cause the cause of the problems mentioned in the passage just preceding it for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day now listen class for our light affliction is but for a moment working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[time=2719] While we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[time=2729] Paul said as we look at our present problems and our suffering and we compare them to the eternal weight of glory notice the contrast our light affliction our momentary affliction and our weight of glory and our eternal glory with God.
[time=2748] What a contrast. Paul is saying to the Corinthians that the suffering that we have now is but for a moment and though it seems heavy to us in comparison to our eternal weight of glory with the Father there is no way that you can put them on the balance and have them equal out.
[time=2765] As I think about our Savior with His face set toward the cross I cannot help but think that in that prayer He is teaching us that the secret to understanding trial and difficulty and tribulation is to look beyond it to the glory that will be ours someday.
[time=2781] Those of you who suffer with the difficulties of the body someday you will have a glorified body. Those of you who suffer with the anxieties of the mind someday your mind will be glorified and you will have perfection in your mental processes.
[time=2799] Some of you that are torn apart with the diseases of the emotion look beyond that to the day of your glorified existence with God for you shall stand in glory and the light affliction which you experience now is not to be compared to that which is yours.
[time=2815] There's a message in this prayer for suffering Christians. May I point out secondly that there's a message in this prayer for self-centered Christians.
[time=2828] The Lord Jesus prayed that He would be glorified by the Father. He did not pray that He would be enriched by men nor that He would be honored by the world.
[time=2842] He looked beyond all the attempts that were made to put Him in a place of prominence. He ran from the opportunity to be enthroned as King. He wanted one thing in His life and that was that He would be glorified by the Father.
[time=2855] And this should be our desire to Christ earlier in the book of John on a couple of occasions rebuked men for not understanding the distinction here. If you have your Bibles open to the book of John you can turn quickly back to the fifth chapter in verse 44.
[time=2871] And in chapter 5 and verse 44 we read these words. When the Lord was speaking He said, "How can ye believe who receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?"
[time=2888] Turn in your Bibles to the 12th chapter of the book of John and verses 42 and 43. In here we read these words, "Nevertheless among the chief rulers also, many believed on Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him lest they should be put out of the synagogue."
[time=2907] Now listen to this, for they love the praise of men more than the praise of God. In the prayer of our Savior to His Father He teaches us that we cannot be self-centered Christians and glorifying to God.
[time=2925] He did not seek for the praise of men but He sought for the praise of His Father. Wouldn't it be different in our Christian circles if that were the number one priority in our lives?
[time=2939] Oh, how we strive among our peers for recognition. How we seek to be honored above all others. I was attending the Moody pastors conference not too long ago and I heard Dr. Warren Wiersby say something along these lines and he said when he went to the Moody church it was down in attendance.
[time=2963] Throughout the country at that time everybody was talking about the greatest this and the greatest that and the biggest this and the biggest that. And he said he one time got a temptation to put an ad in the Chicago paper.
[time=2974] Dr. Warren Wiersby, pastor of the church with the largest unused balcony. He said his staff wouldn't let him do it because they were afraid it would be hard on his image.
[time=2986] Why is it that we have to so strive to be something other than what God would have us to be? Is there not a clue here for us that if we seek the praise of men we can't have the praise of God.
[time=2998] There are preachers all over this land who won't say what the book says and what they personally believe because there are people sitting out in the congregation who won't like it and they fear for their job.
[time=3008] I've had pastors write me letters and tell me I wish I had the courage to stand up and say what that book says like you do. I preached at a conference not too long ago from another denomination.
[time=3019] And when I got finished preaching the first time in my life this has ever happened the people stood and applauded and they weren't applauding me they were applauding what I said from the scripture.
[time=3029] And after I got done a man stood in the podium and he said oh if we could get our preachers to preach like that from the Bible.
[time=3039] Why don't they? Because they want the praise of men and they're afraid that they won't be accepted by the people to whom they minister.
[time=3049] And when a pastor gets into a place like that he's lost his power and he's lost his authority and he's lost his right to stand in the pulpit.
[time=3056] God help us if we ever get to the place where we seek the praise of men more than the honor of God.
[time=3061] The thing that ought to be most important to you and to me as Christians is that when we go to put our head on the pillow at night we can look up into the face of the Father and say Father I have glorified thee.
[time=3072] And I don't have anything to fear that what I've done today has been pleasing to thee and when you do that you won't always please men.
[time=3079] Sometimes they won't like what's done but if you have as your goal to please the Father what a difference it makes.
[time=3087] And then thirdly there is a lesson here not only for suffering Christians and for self-centered Christians but there's a message here for seeking Christians.
[time=3096] In this passage of scripture there is a prayer.
[time=3099] It is a prayer by the Savior to the Father and let me just quickly point out two things about the prayer.
[time=3106] First of all it was a prayer in the will of God and secondly it was a prayer in the glory for the glory of God.
[time=3113] How can I tell you it is a prayer in the will of God?
[time=3116] Well back in chapter 12 and verse 28 God the Father had already promised to answer the prayer.
[time=3123] He says Father glorify thy name then there was a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and I will glorify it again.
[time=3133] And Jesus prayed in chapter 17 glorify thy son why would he pray something that God had already told him would happen?
[time=3140] For the same reason you and I pray the requests of our heart when God has already promised to answer them from the Bible.
[time=3148] What a wonderful thing to pray the promises of God back to him knowing full well that he will answer them.
[time=3155] When you want your prayers answered you pray in the will of God and how do you know the will of God?
[time=3159] Well you search the scriptures to find it and then when you find it remember that no providence nor promise renders your prayer meaningless or useless.
[time=3172] God hears the prayers in his will and then secondly and very quickly notice he prayed for the glory of God.
[time=3181] That thy son he said may glorify thee.
[time=3185] Lord glorify me and what is the master motive that I might glorify thee?
[time=3193] It's all right to pray that God would bless you if the motive behind it is that by blessing you you can reflect back to the glory of God.
[time=3203] I was sharing with the staff this week that wonderful prayer in 1 Chronicles chapter 4.
[time=3210] Sometimes when you get an opportunity to look to it and study it it's the prayer of J Bez in a chapter that's filled with genealogies one of the most boring portions of the scripture to read devotionally.
[time=3221] It goes on listing the names more and more and then all of a sudden dropped right in the middle of the desert land of scripture are two verses and those verses say this J Bez was more honorable than all his brethren.
[time=3234] And he prayed and his prayer was fourfold. Oh God bless me. Isn't that interesting? Bless me Lord.
[time=3242] And in large my borders give me more influence for you and keep your hand upon me and keep me from evil that it might not grieve me.
[time=3254] And the Lord did that which J Bez requested. You know why? Because J Bez didn't want it for himself. He wanted it for the glory of God.
[time=3264] I told the staff a story that I'll have to abbreviate quickly about a man named Jones who went to heaven and after having his tour of heaven was taken to a very special building and when he walked inside it was filled with shelves.
[time=3277] He asked his guide the Apostle Peter to show him what was on the shelves and he found a box there with his name on it and Peter said to Mr. Jones you're going to be sorry if you opened that.
[time=3287] You'll be sorry if you look what's in it. But his curiosity got the best of him. Mr. Jones took the box from off the shelf and took off the cover and looked inside and to his amazement were all the blessings that God wanted to give him while he was on earth for which he never asked.
[time=3305] I wonder how much God wants to do for us but he can't do it because we never ask him and when we ask him it's not for his glory but for ours.
[time=3317] The Father answered the request of the Son and may I remind you that if we will be to Christ what he was to the Father Christ will be to us what the Father was to him.
[time=3332] Shall we pray?
[time=3336] Father be glorified in the preaching of thy word and in this moment of time glorify thy name through the response of men and women while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed as we conclude this portion of our service.
[time=3356] Let me say this word to those of you who are watching at home if you do not know Christ as your Savior you cannot glorify his name until first of all you accept him into your life and into your heart.
[time=3367] Right now in this moment of time bow your head and ask him to come into your life confess your sin acknowledge him as your Savior and he will come in and he will be your personal Savior and you can begin to live your life to glorify him.
[time=3384] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
