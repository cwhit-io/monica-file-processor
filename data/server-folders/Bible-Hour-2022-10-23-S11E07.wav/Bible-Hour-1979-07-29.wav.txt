[time=10] From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=20] Oh my Savior God to me, oh thank the Lord, oh thank the Lord,
[time=32] let's sing for soul, oh my Savior God to me, oh thank the Lord, oh thank the Lord.
[time=49] [ Singing ] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=60] We sing unto the praise of our Savior in heaven, how great thou art, and we do it every Sunday, but it never becomes trident old to us, because that is the spirit of our heart.
[time=72] All that we are and have and all that we do, all that we bring to God by way of worship today is in light of that theme in our hearts,
[time=81] that we want to worship him and adore him and extol his greatness.
[time=88] In the New Testament, when the Lord was tempted in the wilderness, He answered every temptation by Satan with a quotation from the old scriptures,
[time=99] the Old Testament.
[time=101] One of those quotations was this one, "Man shall not live by bread alone." Bill Gather in his recent writings of hymns for the Church has put that into harmony and our choir is going to sing it for us now,
[time=120] "Man shall not live by bread alone."
[time=125] [MUSIC]
[time=144] [ Singing ]
[time=393] Thank you, choir, for reminding us of that truth from the Book of Matthew, "Man can't live by bread alone." Now we're going to listen to some music from our own minister of music, Mr. Don Kruger, and he comes to share with us a song entitled "Grace Greater Than Our Sin."
[time=413] [MUSIC]
[time=427] [ Singing ]
[time=585] "Grace is a free gift of God.
[time=588] It's not something that we earn or something that we deserve.
[time=592] It's different than the mercy of God.
[time=594] The mercy of God is God withholding from me something I deserve, judgment, hell.
[time=600] But God's grace is something that he gives me, I don't deserve it.
[time=605] It's heaven, it's Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=611] And you who I want him to see his face,
[time=623] you can this moment, this grace, receive.
[time=632] [ Singing ]
[time=689] We're so grateful to have you join us today and share the Bible hour and give us the opportunity to sit down in your living room with you for these few moments and talk to you about the things that are so very important to this ministry.
[time=702] And I'm so happy to have Donna with me today.
[time=705] Donna, I guess I should say happy birthday to you.
[time=708] It doesn't often happen that a birthday falls on the Lord's Day, but today it did.
[time=712] And I just want to say happy birthday to you in front of all of our friends so that they know this is a special day in your life and your new dress and all the rest of it goes with it.
[time=722] Do something to cheer me up, I'm getting too near that dangerous point.
[time=726] No, I don't think that's a problem.
[time=728] I know you have some good news to share as it relates to the television ministry and the people who are sponsoring us and writing to us and sharing with us in the cost of it.
[time=738] And this is the biggest day we've ever had in terms of associate sponsors.
[time=742] So why don't you share with our friends first of all a little bit about what a sponsor is and then who our sponsors are today.
[time=749] A sponsor is an individual who underwrites a particular Sunday's programming in their area.
[time=758] And if you are not able to completely underwrite a total program which amounts to several hundred dollars, we have an associate sponsors program where if you contribute one hundred dollars to the Bible hour, then you are an associate sponsor.
[time=773] And today we have three associate sponsors for this particular program.
[time=778] Ina made Jenkins and here again we double thank you to her because she's also a founders club member and Bernice Lenz and Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Knight.
[time=790] These three people are co-sponsoring our program today.
[time=794] Honey the first two are people who watch the program here in Fort Wayne on channel 21.
[time=800] But the nights are friends of the ministry from Indianapolis who watch on channel 40 and that's a great encouragement to us too.
[time=807] And each one of these individuals and couples will be receiving a special sponsor certificate that shows the day that they sponsored the program, their name.
[time=818] And thank you from us to them for helping us preach the gospel to many people today.
[time=824] It's a frameable certificate that's just a way of our expressing to them our appreciation for their helping us during this time.
[time=832] We are very excited about the sponsors program because it enables us to reach out in a better way to touch the lives of people.
[time=840] And one of the ways that we reach out is not only through the television ministry but through the literature and the books that we're able to send to those who write.
[time=849] And we have a very special book that we just introduced for the first time last week.
[time=854] I think it's going to be one of the very favorite all time book gifts that we've given to our friends at home.
[time=860] The book is entitled The Answer Book, a very simple book and a very simple title but it's going to meet a need in the lives of many people.
[time=870] Don, I'm sure that there have been times in your life as there have in mind when there have been questions that have just really haunted you.
[time=878] You knew there was something in the Bible that might help but you didn't know where to look.
[time=882] I think all of us go through particular problems in our life. For instance, there are many times when we're lonely even though we are in a world that has overpopulated many of us that given times face loneliness.
[time=897] And we need an encouragement from the scriptures and yet we don't know quite where to go to find it.
[time=902] This little booklet gives you the passages of scripture and has the scripture actually written out for you to read it.
[time=908] And I think it will be very helpful to many people who are facing problems of depression, anxiety. This booklet has the answers.
[time=917] And the reason I'm so excited about it is that it gives the answer.
[time=921] There are many answers available in today's world that are being bandied about in the name of an answer but this is the answer from God.
[time=929] You may be experiencing some great loneliness. You may be experiencing some doubts about your salvation.
[time=939] You may be experiencing frustration in your work. And if you feel those things deeply in your heart, you want to hear something from God that will meet that need in your own life.
[time=949] And sometimes we pick up the Bible with all of its many pages and we know there's an answer in there somewhere if we just knew where to locate it.
[time=957] That's why we've put together this special little answer book because the key passages relating to the various problems and subjects of life are listed there for you.
[time=968] The book comes in a handy to carry size so that you can put it into your pocket, slip it into your pocket book.
[time=975] Some will put it in their lunch pail and take it to work with them. And it's available to you when you need it at a moment's notice to find that particular passage that you want.
[time=984] And then you don't have to go and look it up in the scripture for it's written out right there and you can just read it right off the pages of the answer book.
[time=992] We'd like to send that book into your home this week as a free gift and as a way of expressing to you our appreciation for your being a part of our Bible, our family today.
[time=1002] The answer book will be sent to you free and postage paid if you will just write to us this week.
[time=1008] All you need to do is write to pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815.
[time=1018] Share with us the channel on which you are viewing the Bible hour and request your free copy of the answer book.
[time=1025] And when you write if you're interested in becoming a part of the sponsors program we'll be happy to send you all the information that you need so that you can join with us in reaching out to many more people.

[time=1442] [MUSIC]
[time=1454] Thank you star that minister to all of our hearts did he not we have been studying in the 17th chapter of John and the prayer of Jesus Christ the high priestly prayer of Christ just before we look again into that portion of the word of God.
[time=1471] Let's listen to the men singers as they sing the song a prayer to the Father.
[time=1483] [MUSIC]
[time=1497] Oh Father in heaven we honor your name.
[time=1523] We want your kingdom to come.
[time=1529] We want your will to be done here on earth as we never know.
[time=1547] Give us this song please give us our daily prayer and forgive ourselves just as we have done for others.
[time=1576] [MUSIC]
[time=1589] Please don't bring us to temptation.
[time=1608] But deliver us, oh deliver us only the one.
[time=1626] Oh Lord Jesus keep not, your tears of power to you we give only now and forever more.
[time=1649] To you we give only now and forever more on this, on this, on this, on this, on this, on this.
[time=1678] [MUSIC]
[time=1688] Shall we pray together?
[time=1691] Let's join together shall we in repeating that prayer that has been given to us in the scripture.
[time=1698] And let's pray it out loud here in the auditorium and those of you who share this service with us at home may join in with us if you like.
[time=1706] So we begin this portion of our service with this prayer.
[time=1710] Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1723] Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
[time=1735] And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil, for thy and the power and the glory forever, amen.
[time=1752] Turning from that prayer to the Lord Jesus high priestly prayer in the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=1762] I am reading today the first four verses of this chapter, John chapter 17 verses 1 through 4.
[time=1774] These words spoke Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father the hour is come.
[time=1781] Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee.
[time=1787] Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[time=1794] And this is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[time=1802] I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work which thou gave us me to do.
[time=1811] In these first few verses of the high priestly prayer the Lord Jesus is making a plea for his own self glorification.
[time=1822] In order that he might ultimately glorify the Father.
[time=1826] In the verses that we have already studied we have come through three different reasons for the glorification of the Father through the Son.
[time=1836] The first reason that we looked at was the relationship which Christ had to the Father.
[time=1842] Notice in the first verse he says, Father glorify thy son.
[time=1848] The relationship to the Father is the first reason for his own glorification.
[time=1854] Secondly we notice the recognition that Christ had of the divine schedule that he was on.
[time=1861] He said the hour is come, it is time for my glorification.
[time=1866] Second reason for his glorification was that the time schedule was right.
[time=1872] Thirdly he gives to us the reason of his own right to the place of authority.
[time=1880] For we read in verse two as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[time=1889] In other words he deserves glorification because he has earned the right to rule.
[time=1895] The realm of authority is his.
[time=1898] And then we come to the fourth reason which is the subject of today's message.
[time=1903] And that is his realization of his finished task.
[time=1907] He said, I have finished the work which thou gave us to me to do.
[time=1912] So in your notes as you think about these first four verses you need to remember that when Jesus Christ prayed to be glorified there were four reasons for his prayer.
[time=1922] First of all because of his relationship to the Father.
[time=1926] Secondly because of his recognition of the divine time schedule that was his.
[time=1931] Thirdly because of his right and rule that was his and fourthly because of his realization of the finished task.
[time=1941] He says in verse four I have finished the task which thou gave us to me to do.
[time=1950] I never read those words but what I am filled with wonder and marvel that anyone who could ever walk upon this earth could say I have finished the task which you gave me to do.
[time=1963] My whole life seems to be one series of too many jobs to get done.
[time=1970] I had a professor in seminary who used to warn us that when we went into the ministry we would have a terrible adjustment and that adjustment would be the adjustment of learning to live with unfinished work for there's never a time when it ever gets done.
[time=1985] He reminded us that being in the ministry was like dipping out of the ocean with a teaspoon you dip and dip and dip and when you get done it's all still there.
[time=1994] And I understand something about that now and yet I read in the pages of the Holy Scripture the words of the divine son of God that he finished the task which God gave him to do.
[time=2006] And so immediately my defense mechanisms are up and I do what all of you do when you read these glorious truths about the Savior.
[time=2013] I chalk it up to the divinity within him and I say certainly that's understandable he was the son of God he was God in the flesh.
[time=2022] Until I pick up my Bible and I read over a few pages into the New Testament and I come to the life of Paul and there I read Paul saying to those to whom he has written I have finished my course.
[time=2036] I am now ready to be offered I have done everything that you've asked me to do and so the guilt floods in upon me again and I recognize that there is a truth to be learned in this passage of Scripture about how to get the job done.
[time=2056] How to finish the task may I remind you that the first key to understanding that in the life of our blessed Lord is this we must comprehend this basic fact about him and that is this he understood his assignment.
[time=2074] Now that may seem like a very trivial thing for me to mention at the outset of this message but let it be said here today that one of the reasons there is so much frustration among all of us is that we're not quite sure what the assignment is.
[time=2088] Jesus understood his assignment I could take you back to the book of Proverbs if we had time today and there in a prophetic passage of Scripture reminds you that before the world was created he knew what his assignment was.
[time=2103] But let me bring you a little further this way in the timeline to his incarnation and if you have your Bibles turned to the book of Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 7 where we read concerning his coming into this world that he was knowledgeable about the assignment that had been given to him.
[time=2122] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 and this is what we read then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God.
[time=2135] Now if you'll notice in that verse there is a parentheses and sometimes a parentheses makes the reading a little bit difficult so omit the parentheses and read it this way then said I lo I come to do thy will oh God.
[time=2151] When Jesus came into the world the writer of the Hebrews has him saying as he comes into the world Lord I come to do thy will.
[time=2163] And he has scarcely been on this earth but twelve years and we read about him in the second chapter of the book of Luke in verse 49 that he went one day with his parents.
[time=2176] You know that beautiful story and as he got to the temple it was time to come home and they left thinking he was tagging along behind and they got about part of the way home and discovered that he wasn't with him and they were very exercised and they went back to get him
[time=2192] and when they found him he was consulting with the leadership. No he wasn't asking the questions he was answering them and they scolded him a bit and in Luke chapter 2 verse 49 we read these words from the lips of our Savior and he said unto them how is it that she sought me.
[time=2211] Wish ye not that I must be about my father's business. Jesus said why are you looking for me don't you understand that I have a job to do and I have to do my father's will.
[time=2222] That's what I am here for lo I came into the world for that and here I am carrying on my responsibilities doing what the father called me to do.
[time=2231] And then if you have your Bibles turn over to the fourth chapter of the book of John and here we find him again reminding his peers and those who would question him that he was on a divine assignment from God and he knew what that assignment was.
[time=2246] John chapter 4 and verse 34 his disciples tried to get him to eat some physical food and he said my food or my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.
[time=2260] Jesus said I came into this world to do God's will and I intend to finish the work that he gave me to do.
[time=2267] Keep turning in your Bibles to chapter 9 of John where we have the record of the healing of the blind man and in chapter 9 of the book of John and verse 4 we read these words.
[time=2281] He was asked by those around him which had sinned the man born blinders parents and he said neither one of them sinned but that the works of Christ might be manifest and then in verse 4 he said I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night comeeth when no man can work.
[time=2300] Turn in your Bibles to chapter 5 of John and verse 19 and here we read again Jesus answered then answered Jesus and said unto them, "Verily, verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeeth the father do.
[time=2319] For whatever things he doeth these also doeth the son in the same manner." Notice verse 36 in the same chapter.
[time=2327] "But I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the father hath given me to finish.
[time=2333] The same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me."
[time=2339] Now what is he saying in all of this?
[time=2342] He's saying that Jesus came into the world and he knew what he was supposed to do and he set his mind upon the goal of finishing the task and now over here in the 17th chapter of John we are reading his prayer.
[time=2356] It is the high priestly prayer.
[time=2358] It is prayed as if the end had already been accomplished.
[time=2362] And he says in that prayer, "Lord, I've finished the job that you gave me to do. I've finished the task which you gave me."
[time=2375] You see his assignment was to do God's will in his life and he knew the job and he knew the assignment and he never strayed from it to the right or to the left.
[time=2385] Whenever he was asked to do that which was not in the mainstream of God's will for his life he always answered, "I must do the works of him that sent me while it is day."
[time=2396] If you understand the nature of Satan's attacks upon him in the wilderness you will understand that Satan was trying to get him to move away from the central purpose of his coming,
[time=2408] to make arbitrary demonstrations of his authority and power and the Lord Jesus would have none of it.
[time=2414] He answered him with the Scripture and he would not follow the leadership of Satan to take him off the task.
[time=2421] And so in the 19th chapter of the book of John in verse 30 where we have the wonderful story of the crucifixion it came at last to that moment in time when he was about to give up his spirit and what were his final words to God in heaven.
[time=2436] It is finished. He had finished the task.
[time=2443] May I suggest to you that there is a tremendous truth here not only for us to understand about our Savior's prayer but to understand about our own lives as well.
[time=2452] It is a truth that brings conviction to the heart of every Christian who finds at times frustration in serving God and it is this conviction and that is there is no confusion in the will of God.
[time=2464] There is no consternation in God's will.
[time=2468] If we have been called of God to a certain assignment, if we do that assignment and we are in the will of God and we stay on center with that assignment we ought not to feel like we are being pulled apart at the seams.
[time=2482] Is it not some of our frustration in life that we misunderstand our assignment and in doing that which we have not been given to do we find the confusing aspects of living.
[time=2497] Notice John 17 4 says this Jesus said I have finished the task which thou has given me to do.
[time=2509] All the joy and the peace and the serenity of soul that comes to that individual who has a grasp upon the will of God for his life and can say though they ask me to do this or that or the other God has called me to this task
[time=2526] and I am in the will of God and I will do what God called me to do.
[time=2530] This is my assignment and men and women I believe that when we operate that way in our spiritual lives we can come down to the end of the way.
[time=2538] We can look back over a life of fulfillment and we can look up into heaven and say Lord I have finished the job you gave me to do.
[time=2546] That doesn't mean that all of the jobs that need to be done have been completed but it means that the job God gave you to do.
[time=2553] The job he gave me to do has been completed.
[time=2557] The first key is this to understand the assignment.
[time=2563] Let me ask you do you understand your assignment?
[time=2566] Well it's obvious that some of you don't because you vacillate all over the place.
[time=2571] You're all over the ballpark, you're doing one thing one minute and the next thing you've got something else going and it's almost a full time job to keep up with where you are.
[time=2580] You don't know what your assignment is and so there's frustration and anxiety and you're being pulled apart at the seams.
[time=2587] What a terrible thing it is to be in a spot and always be canvassing for something else because you aren't sure what God has called you to do.
[time=2596] Men and women I want to tell you something there is peace and joy and serenity of soul in knowing that you're in the center of God's will and that God's given you an assignment and that you're on target with that assignment.
[time=2608] Oh you stray on occasion because you get blown with the winds of time but there's that fixed course in front of you.
[time=2615] Jesus knew what his assignment was and he accepted it as from God.
[time=2623] Now secondly he not only understood his assignment but he undertook his assignment.
[time=2628] It's one thing to know what you're supposed to do it's another thing to do it.
[time=2634] Most of us know a lot more about what we're supposed to do than what we do but Jesus understood his assignment and he undertook it.
[time=2642] What did he mean when he said it is finished?
[time=2646] May I suggest to you that there are a number of passages to which we could turn to get a full or picture of the assignment of Christ.
[time=2653] But there's one in the Old Testament by way of prophecy that perhaps summarizes it better than any to which we could turn and it's found in the ninth chapter of the book of Daniel.
[time=2663] Daniel chapter 9 and in the 24th verse in one short verse of scripture there is a sketch of the task which God gave the son to accomplish in his lifetime.
[time=2677] Daniel chapter 9 is one of the key prophetic chapters of the Bible.
[time=2682] Here in these few verses unfolds for us the entire prophetic scheme it is the chapter that deals with the 70th week of Daniel, the 70 weeks of prophecy.
[time=2693] It begins back in the Old Testament and stretches forth out into the millennium and it gives to us key information to unfold the prophetic scheme of our day.
[time=2705] But in the 24th verse there is a description of the key events that are going to take place during the time of our Lord's life ministry on this earth.
[time=2718] And in verse 24 we read these words 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city.
[time=2725] Now notice to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.
[time=2740] So here in this verse are six things which the prophet has written down concerning fulfillment and accomplishment within the life concept of Jesus Christ.
[time=2753] And perhaps more than in any other single verse of scripture there is the entire panorama of our Lord's assignment and how it was to be accomplished.
[time=2763] Now there are six individual statements but there is in reality only there are in reality only four different things to which the prophet appeals and let's notice them in order.
[time=2776] First of all his assignment was first of all to finish the transgression or to finish sin to deal with sin.
[time=2786] There are three words for sin in this passage, transgression, iniquity and sins. They deal with the principle and character and practice of sin in one's life.
[time=2797] They deal with the crime of sin, the dead of sin, the disease of sin and the whole purpose of those first three phrases is to say that sin must be dealt with.
[time=2809] To make an end of sin in this passage means to seal it up and to shut it off, to make it no longer have power over men, to put an end or make an end to sin means to cut it off in terms of its power in the life of a person.
[time=2826] The third statement about sin in this verse says to make reconciliation for sins and the word reconciliation is the word which means expiation or satisfaction and it means that Christ needed not only to make an end of sin in its power over us but he had to pay the penalty for it.
[time=2845] He had to be the satisfaction for it so that when a holy God looked down at a sinful man he saw that sin had been dealt with through the sacrifice of Christ on the cross.
[time=2856] The first aspect of our Lord's assignment which he undertook and which ultimately ended at the cross when he cried it is finished was that he had to finish the transgression.
[time=2869] There are two ways to deal with sin according to the Bible. The first one is to be absolutely obedient and be free from it.
[time=2875] The second way is to present a sacrifice and a tone for it but wonder of wonders Jesus Christ did them both for he was absolutely obedient to every aspect of the law and he came to the cross and as a perfect sacrifice he put the end to sin that it might not reign over us.
[time=2898] The principle of sin no longer needs to bind us and hold us for Christ came into this world to become the end of sin to every man that believe it.
[time=2910] The second thing that we learn in this passage from the book of Daniel concerning our Lord's assignment was this.
[time=2916] He came not only to finish the transgression but he came to furnish a way of righteousness. Notice what it says to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness.
[time=2932] Now obviously everlasting righteousness is a reference to the future reign of Christ when righteousness shall rule and reign upon the earth but that righteousness which shall be ours in the kingdom is only the full and unhindered righteousness which starts now in our hearts through the person of Jesus Christ who comes to live within us.
[time=2953] There is an interesting principle as you relate to the dealing with sin in the life of a person. It is not enough for us to go to heaven minus sin for you can't get to heaven on anything that's minus.
[time=2966] You could stand before God and say Lord here I am I minus my sin because you paid the penalty for it and the Lord would have to say I'm sorry that's not good enough for in order for you to get to heaven you not only have to be minus your sin you have to be plus Christ righteousness.
[time=2983] And that's what this means he came to finish the transgression and to furnish righteousness for us. And 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 tells us that he did it this way.
[time=2995] For God hath made him Christ to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[time=3007] I like to read that with my own name in it because it makes it so much more personal and with the name of Christ where it belongs for God made Christ to be sin for David Jeremiah Christ who knew no sin that David Jeremiah might be made the righteousness of God in Christ.
[time=3030] And that's what he did. The great transaction took place on the cross Jesus went there with my sin and he paid the penalty for it.
[time=3039] But in that transaction he not only took my sins away but he gave to me the righteousness which was his alone so that when I stand before God I'm not standing there just minus my sins but I'm standing there plus God's righteousness.
[time=3056] He came to finish the transgression. He came to furnish righteousness for the believer. Notice thirdly he came to fulfill all prophecy.
[time=3065] It says in verse 24 that he came to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and the prophecy. The word seal up means to consummate.
[time=3075] It means to fulfill or secure. There never was a day in all of history nor shall there ever be in the future when more prophecies were fulfilled than on that day when Jesus hung upon the cross.
[time=3085] Looking back into time immemorial to the very beginning of Old Testament Revelation we understand that the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
[time=3096] For in the Old Testament every action that took place seemed to look forward to that day when prophecy would be fulfilled.
[time=3105] The lamb slain before the foundation of the world, the tree of life in the garden, the lamb that was slain for the sacrifices, the coats of skins, the rainbow in the sky, the very ark itself that Noah went into and was saved.
[time=3122] Sacrifices throughout all of the Old Testament scriptures cried out there's coming a day when the prophecy will be fulfilled, the shadow will be done away and the substance will be installed.
[time=3135] And so there was a day on the cross when he fulfilled all prophecy and every word that had ever been spoken concerning Christ came to pass that day.
[time=3146] And then finally in this passage in the book of Daniel we learned that his assignment was to anoint the most holy.
[time=3155] And though that happened when he ascended on high and he sat down by the right hand of the Father and he was given the place of authority and his enemies were put under his feet until he shall ultimately and finally rule and reign.
[time=3169] That prophecy has been fulfilled and yet shall be fulfilled for there's coming a day when he will reign and he will rule and he will be anointed the most holy for all earth to see and he will yet finish his task.
[time=3186] Now when Jesus said in his prayer, "I have finished the work which thou has given me to do," he could say that because he had understood his assignment to be in the will of God and he had undertaken his assignment in all of the ramifications of redemption.
[time=3204] And so when he hung upon the cross and he cried out in that awful voice that signaled the tear of the hour, it is finished.
[time=3218] Oh, what words of triumph they were and how they ought to ring in our ears as Christians. It is finished. Sin has no power over me.
[time=3229] It is finished. Christ has set his approval upon my life through his own death and my behalf and is given to me the righteousness which is his.
[time=3243] Years ago, I heard a message on the crucifixion that indelibly stamped itself upon my heart.
[time=3252] At the end of the message, there was a an oration to describe the beauty and majesty of that moment.
[time=3263] I have heard it so many times. I can't help but remember it. The speaker visualized it in an animate way.
[time=3274] He visualized it as if all of creation were involved and he said the drops of blood came from the hands of the Savior and dripped down upon the earth and they cried it is finished.
[time=3287] And the dust of the earth licked up the drops of blood and cried it is finished and the blades of grass came up throughout the ground and cried it is finished.
[time=3297] And the dew that fell upon the grass cried out it is finished and the flowers that grew up around cried it is finished.
[time=3304] And the dew ascended up into heavens to the clouds and cried it is finished and the clouds carried the message up to heaven and cried it is finished.
[time=3312] And the angels picked it up from the clouds and took it into heaven and cried it is finished.
[time=3319] And the redeemed stood before the Father and said it is finished. The job has been done.
[time=3327] There isn't anything I need to do to add to it. He's paid the price. My sin has been forgiven.
[time=3333] The righteous has been made available to me. I can trust in him because Jesus did the job.
[time=3342] Shall we pray?
[time=3344] Father, help us to understand today that there is not one thing we can do to add to the finished work of Jesus Christ in our behalf.
[time=3361] Our works and our righteousness and all the things that we try to do to measure up to him will not avail.
[time=3371] Lord help us to understand that when He finished the task He made salvation reachable for all mankind if we will just believe and accept.
[time=3384] If there are those here today under the sound of my voice who do not know what it means to live in light of the finished work of Christ may today be a day of great salvation in their life as they come to meet Him at the point of their need.
[time=3401] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed, Jesus has finished the task for you. He asks only that you reach out by faith and believe and accept.
[time=3411] You can do that right now wherever you are by simply acknowledging that you're a sinner and saying in your prayer, Lord, I accept what you did for me on the cross.
[time=3421] I receive you into my life as my Savior. Please come in and take control of my life and He will do it.
