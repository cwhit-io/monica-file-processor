[time=0] (bell dings) (upbeat music)
[time=16] - The Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Lane, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geroma.
[time=26] (crowd chanting) [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=47] - Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=61] - We are enjoying these summer days at the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and we're grateful for all of you who are visiting with us today here in our auditorium.
[time=71] And now for the opportunity that we have to say a warm welcome to all who have joined us by television.
[time=77] Our special guests today are the new disciples from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois, and in just a few moments we'll be hearing from them.
[time=85] We're going to be looking again into the 17th chapter of the book of John as a part of our planned study program this morning.
[time=92] Right now it's time for us to listen to the music of our own choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger as they sang a beautiful anthem of worship.
[time=101] Oh, church, sing on.
[time=103] (gentle piano music)
[time=113] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=255] (singing in foreign language)
[time=315] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language)
[time=345] - Thank you, choir, for sharing that song of praise with us.
[time=362] We're happy today to have with us the new disciples from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=369] Just a few weeks ago, I had the privilege of being at Moody to participate in the pastors' conference.
[time=375] It's a great citadel of Christian truth.
[time=379] And for years, it was known as the West Point of Christian Circles because they train so many of God's servants who are serving Him all over the world today.
[time=388] It's a real joy for us to have these young people with us.
[time=391] They're going to be here throughout today, ministering in music.
[time=394] Right now, I want you to listen to the new disciples from the Moody Bible Institute.
[time=399] (gentle music)
[time=409] [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=625] Thank you so much for joining us today on the Bible Hour
[time=636] and for allowing us this opportunity to sit down together with you at your home and share with you some very important details about the ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour television program.
[time=646] Down over these past weeks we have been having a wonderful time sharing the ministry of the Bible Hour with many friends at home not only on the receiving end but on the giving end.
[time=656] And the sponsors program has really been a delightful thing to watch develop as different ones have gotten behind this ministry in a substantial way to make it happen.
[time=666] That's right and perhaps some of you watching who are not familiar with their sponsors program and what it is is an opportunity for you to sponsor the Bible Hour in your area on a given Sunday.
[time=679] And we have a sponsor today for today's program, Ms. Linda Mikoski is our sponsor.
[time=687] She watches on Channel 21 here in Fort Wayne and she is sponsoring the Bible Hour today in honor of her mother, Laura Mikoski.
[time=696] And we would like to send this beautiful little plaque to Linda as a remembrance of the money that she has spent to send the gospel over the airwaves in honor of her mother.
[time=707] Donna, Linda is a special one in our family because she's also a founder's club member.
[time=714] And that means that she not only has given this special gift but she regularly supports this ministry.
[time=719] And we're so grateful to Linda for her help during these summer days for sponsoring the Bible Hour Telecast here in the Fort Wayne area today.
[time=727] If you would like information about how you can be involved in the sponsorship program, please write to us and request it and we'll be happy to send it to you and enable you to be involved in helping us as we preach the gospel to many hundreds of people here in this area and in the other areas where the Bible Hour is seen.
[time=744] Some folks have decided rather than to become a full sponsor to share with us in what we call the Associate Sponsorship Program.
[time=753] This certificate represents the Associate Sponsors Program and the Associate Sponsors are those who give $100 to help in sponsoring a program on a given station on the Bible Hour network.
[time=767] So if you're watching in any of the areas where the Bible Hour is seen on a regular basis and you would like to have a part in sponsoring the Bible Hour and you cannot do it on a full sponsorship program, we'd be happy to talk with you about the Associate Sponsors Program and during these next weeks we will be mentioning many, many associate sponsors who have already written to us and requested the opportunity of sponsoring this program on a specific Sunday.
[time=791] Once again, for information about the entire sponsorship program, write to us here at the Bible Hour office and that address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=805] Donna, we have been so very excited about a very interesting little Bible study tool called the Answer Book.
[time=812] What is the Answer Book?
[time=814] The Answer Book is just that.
[time=816] It has the answers to many of the problems in life that we face from day to day.
[time=821] Perhaps you are having a problem in forgiving others.
[time=824] Maybe someone has done something to offend you and you're having a real struggle in your own heart in trying to forgive that person.
[time=831] This little answer booklet has the scripture references for you in dealing with that problem.
[time=838] It not only gives the scripture reference, but it has the actual scripture written out so that you don't have to spend the time to look it up in the Bible if you don't have one hand at that moment.
[time=849] It's really a handy little tool to have.
[time=851] It has a lot of different subjects, guilt and forgiveness as I mentioned, faith, loneliness.
[time=859] Here on this very page that is opened in the Answer Book is the next subject after forgiving others which is grief and sorrow.
[time=866] And so people who are experiencing that difficulty can look at the scripture verses.
[time=870] Another thing that I appreciate about the way the book is organized is that each verse is offset in a different type style.
[time=877] In other words, as you read down through the page one verse is in light style, the other is in dark so that you can separate the verses.
[time=884] And yet as you open this book you're able to read all of the pertinent verses on the given subjects.
[time=889] We've gone through the scripture and pulled out of the Bible the very key passages on each of these subjects and then put them together and organized them in this special little book.
[time=900] And I know that it's going to be a real blessing to you.
[time=903] I had breakfast with a friend this morning and had an opportunity to give one to him.
[time=907] It's the kind of thing you can stick in your pocket, put in your purse, carry inside the back of your Bible.
[time=913] And when you're counseling with friends, when someone calls and they have a need and you need that scripture verse to help them you can just open it up quickly and find the verse and it'll be a real blessing to them as well as to your own life.
[time=925] We'd like to send you a free copy of the Answer Book this week and we'll do it if you'll write to us and request it.
[time=931] There is no cost or charge for it. We're happy to send it to you free and postage paid.
[time=936] And Donna, you tell them how to get it, will you?
[time=939] Just drop us a line this week and tell us that you would like your free copy of the Answer Book.
[time=944] Write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=954] And we'll be sure to get one in the mail to you.
[time=956] We thank you so much for sharing with us today on the Bible Hour and I trust that you'll stay with us now as we go back to our morning service.
[time=963] In just a moment I'm going to be opening the Word of God to speak to you on the subject of Christ's Prayer for you.
[time=969] As He sits at the right hand of the Father in Heaven, He's praying for you.
[time=973] What does He pray? We'll find that out in a few moments as we open the Word of God together.
[time=986] [MUSIC]
[time=1012] And thank you for that good singing.
[time=1015] Now we want you to listen again to the Ministry of Music by the New Disciples from Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1021] They're going to sing a song that speaks to the fact that as believers we are one.
[time=1029] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=1100] Inside these cold and empty walls we have watched the time go by
[time=1108] and we've tried to justify the many reasons why we waited for so long
[time=1117] while the world goes on its own.
[time=1120] Still our brother stands alone. We are part of the body jointed love
[time=1128] and we in the spirit of His Son.
[time=1134] We're free to live and breathe as one.
[time=1140] To share this new life we've begun.
[time=1145] We are one.
[time=1152] [MUSIC]
[time=1158] Oh God, we see the feeling of our ways, of the empty graves we've prayed, and the fruitless dance we played.
[time=1169] So don't touch us now.
[time=1174] We're ready, we are known.
[time=1177] In the body of Your Son, our actals have been won.
[time=1182] We are part of the body jointed love.
[time=1187] Come plead Him the spirit of His Son.
[time=1192] We're free to live and breathe as one.
[time=1198] To share this new life we've begun.
[time=1203] We are one.
[time=1220] In His spirit, in His spirit we are one.
[time=1230] We are one.
[time=1239] [MUSIC]
[time=1242] Thank you, young people.
[time=1245] Just say it right here in your main course.
[time=1247] Again in a moment.
[time=1248] I don't want everyone to panic when I do this.
[time=1250] I'm not going to sing.
[time=1253] But I do want to introduce someone to you, and I'm going to ask Joanne Rowl if she will to come out.
[time=1258] We have been praying all summer that God would meet the needs that we have in our school by bringing to a spirit filled teachers who could in the classroom communicate the Christian faith, which is the purpose of the Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=1273] And God has met every need.
[time=1275] We stand now at the beginning of the month of August with every position filled.
[time=1280] And He has wonderfully met every need that we have.
[time=1283] Joanne Rowl is going to be teaching kindergarten.
[time=1286] Joanne, you'll have to come a little closer here so you can talk.
[time=1289] I want you to share with these folks first of all how you came to know Christ as your personal savior.
[time=1294] Okay, I grew up in Illinois near Pecan on a farm and my parents are Christians.
[time=1299] And it was through them and through my church that I came to know the Lord.
[time=1303] And I have a sister and a brother who are older than I.
[time=1307] And one night when I was just five years old my parents set us down around the table.
[time=1312] And they said even though we are Christians and that you attend church and you even love Jesus and sing and talk about Him, you have to make a definite decision yourself.
[time=1321] And they talked to each one of us about it and then they said, "You know, to my sister was 11, would you like to accept Christ?" "No," she says, "to my brother," he says, "No." And then to me and I said, "Yes." And I remember kneeling down with them and asking the Lord to forgive my sins.
[time=1336] And it's really precious to me because I know, I remember that as if it were yesterday.
[time=1341] You know, it was a very real experience.
[time=1343] And the fact that, you know, I'm teaching these children, I realize, you know, how much they can understand.
[time=1349] Joanne is a graduate of Taylor University and you'll never believe what her first teaching assignment was.
[time=1355] Why don't you tell them about that, Joanne?
[time=1357] Okay, I've spent the last three years in Nassau, Bahamas teaching in a Christian school.
[time=1362] And I've really enjoyed the Lord who led me there really miraculously just as He's led me here now.
[time=1368] We can't offer you the same kind of climate and the same kind of weather.
[time=1372] But we do have wonderful families and great young people for you to teach.
[time=1377] Joanne, just in a sentence or two, tell us why you believe it's God's will for you to be teaching in a Christian school.
[time=1384] Yeah, I feel like I can't imagine myself teaching and not being free to share with children about the Lord.
[time=1391] And it's not just teaching the Bible story.
[time=1394] I mean, you can do that in 10 or 15 minutes, but it's what happens the rest of the day, you know, and how the Holy Spirit can lead you to talk to the children about the Lord and let them know that, you know, He's a center and everything else we do can revolve around Him and being able to use that with the children and really affecting them.
[time=1412] When you came to meet with us just a few weeks ago, you had two needs, a job and a place to live.
[time=1418] And God in a wonderful way took care of those.
[time=1420] Tell our friends about how God met the first need before, or the second need before He met the first one.
[time=1425] Right, I came to Fort Wayne and I had the interview with Mr. Moran, and during the interview, somehow He asked me where I'd be living, and I said, "Well, I'm praying for someone to live with,
[time=1436] until then I'll probably live with my sister and her husband." And He said, "Oh, I have just the person." And so He told me about Mary Cruz, and He said that she needed a roommate, and so He gave me her address.
[time=1447] The next day I looked her name up in the phone book, and I just phoned her, and I said, "You don't know me, but I'm looking for a roommate." And it was really neat because then we had decided to live together, and I thought, "For the Lord really has been blessing me because He gave me a roommate and a place to live, and so I knew He was going to give me a job in Fort Wayne." Really helped my faith.
[time=1465] Amen. We didn't have any choice. We had to hire her.
[time=1468] Thank you, Joanne. God bless you.
[time=1472] Let's listen now to the new disciples as they sing again.
[time=1475] Father, if it wasn't for the love you have for me,
[time=1498] I could never be free from all the self and the sin that I have with you.
[time=1507] And I know you want to change my life.
[time=1514] Father, if you look back my life, I'm seeking you.
[time=1522] And I know now it's true. I must surrender my heart.
[time=1528] I must set it apart, or I know that you can change my life.
[time=1538] I knew, I knew, every moment of life, who I need you.
[time=1550] I love you. I love you. Every moment of life, who I love you.
[time=1563] Father, you have shown me that there's so much to be done.
[time=1571] And I've only begun to understand what I am.
[time=1578] Now I fit in your plan, always growing as you change my life.
[time=1588] I'll seek you. I'll seek you. Every moment of my life, I want to see you.
[time=1613] I'll praise you. Every moment of my life, I want to praise you.
[time=1637] Every moment of my life, I want to praise you.
[time=1653] Thank you, young people. And for those of you who share the Bible Hour television program here in Fort Wayne,
[time=1661] let me give to you a personal invitation to join us tonight at 645 for a special sacred concert by the new disciples as a part of our regular evening service.
[time=1671] As you're turning in your Bibles to the 17th chapter of the book of John,
[time=1677] let me share with you just a bit of news from the mission field that I think you'll all be interested to hear.
[time=1683] Several years ago, we began supporting a missionary from here in Fort Wayne by the name of Alice Augsburgher.
[time=1692] And God has mightily used her on the mission field. Then just two years ago, we had the joy of having here for our missionary conference, Dr. Ken Cole, a recent graduate of Cedarville College and a young man who was on his way to the mission field.
[time=1707] And this week, we learned that Dr. Ken Cole and Alice Augsburgher are coming home in December to get married.
[time=1716] And going back to the field is a team. And I want to say that simply as a way of encouraging all of you young people
[time=1724] who are afraid that if you go to the mission field, you won't get a partner that maybe if you go there in the will of God, he's got somebody stashed away over there for you. And he'll have just the right one. That's exciting to me.
[time=1735] There are two wonderful young people. I know they would appreciate your prayers during these days, and we hope that we'll be able to see them when they're home during the Christmas holidays.
[time=1744] If you have their addresses, a word from you by way of encouragement would be a real blessing to them
[time=1750] as they know that you know what God has been doing in their lives.
[time=1753] In the 17th chapter of John, we have moved through the first five verses and the first section of our Lord's Prayer during which time we have discussed His Prayer for Himself.
[time=1765] We come now to the sixth verse and the second section of the prayer where we study together
[time=1771] our Lord's Prayer for His disciples and by way of illustration His Prayer for us who are His disciples today.
[time=1779] We read in the sixth verse these words, "I have manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gave us to me out of the world;
[time=1787] thine they were, and thou gave us them to me, and they have kept thy word.
[time=1793] Now they have known that all things, whatever thou hast given me are of thee, for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us to me, and they have received them, and I have known surely that I came out of thee, and they have believed that thou did sent me.
[time=1808] I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them who thou hast given me, for they are thine,
[time=1815] and all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.
[time=1820] And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee, Holy Father,
[time=1826] keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are.
[time=1833] While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name.
[time=1836] Those that thou gave us me have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
[time=1843] And now I come to thee, and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[time=1850] I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[time=1857] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.
[time=1863] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[time=1866] Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth, as thou hast sent me into the world.
[time=1873] Even so have I also sent them into the world, and for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
[time=1883] Shall we pray together?
[time=1885] Lord, it is almost inconceivable to us that a prayer is being offered in heaven, in our behalf.
[time=1896] The Lord Jesus, the blessed Savior of the world, who came into this world to redeem us, now glorified at the right hand of the Father, interceding for us.
[time=1909] Oftentimes we have wondered what it is that He prays, what is on the prayer list of the Savior as He remembers us to the Father.
[time=1918] As we have been allowed this glimpse into the holy of holies of the Gospels, we get just a picture of the burden in the heart of Jesus for His own here upon this earth.
[time=1930] Lord, we pray that as we understand this prayer today, you will help us to understand the importance of our living in such a way that we would be worthy of such a tremendous heritage,
[time=1943] and that we ourselves will be committed to being a part of the answer of Christ's prayer as we live our lives in this world today.
[time=1952] We pray in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=1957] I have often wondered what it would be like to be able to listen to the conversation in heaven between the Son of God and the Father.
[time=1970] Somehow the thought that divinity prays is a bit hard for us to handle.
[time=1976] We understand our prayer life to be represented because of our need, and we reach out to God in prayer,
[time=1983] but the Bible tells us that the Son makes intercession for us to the Father.
[time=1989] He is the mediator between God and man, and we wonder at times what it is that must be said in our behalf.
[time=1997] Though this prayer is not a prayer recorded that takes place in heaven, it is the prayer of our Savior on this earth, and it gives to us a glimpse into the throne room of glory
[time=2007] that we may understand what the burden of the Savior is for us as we live our lives here.
[time=2014] I suppose if we were to make our own lists of the things which we would consider to be important, we might miss all of the emphasis of our Savior's prayer.
[time=2025] But rather than do that, let us look into the heart of the Savior Himself, and hear from His own lips the words that He prays, that He prays for us.
[time=2036] The passage that we look at today can be divided into three sections.
[time=2041] First of all, we will look at the petition that the Savior offers.
[time=2046] And then secondly, as we examine this passage of Scripture, we will look at the purpose of His prayer.
[time=2052] And finally, the plea that He makes in our behalf.
[time=2057] First of all, the petition.
[time=2060] Interestingly enough, the prayer of our Savior in our behalf is wrapped up in one word which is repeated twice in the text.
[time=2068] It is found first of all in verse 11 and again in verse 15.
[time=2073] We read in verse 11, "These words, holy Father, keep through thine own name, those whom thou hast given me,
[time=2081] that they may be one as we are." And again in verse 15, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one." The prayer of the Savior to the Father in our behalf men and women is that we might be kept from evil.
[time=2103] Jesus Christ, now at the right hand of the Father, is praying for you and for me
[time=2109] that we might be kept from the evil one, that we might be kept and protected from the influences of Satan as He reaches out to grab hold of our spiritual lives
[time=2121] and destroy our testimony in this world.
[time=2124] As we go out of our houses in the morning on the way to our jobs, to the places where we work, where we exert an influence for good or for ill, the Savior in heaven is praying that we will be kept from the clutches of the evil one.
[time=2139] In this prayer He qualifies His request.
[time=2143] He says, "I do not pray that they shall be taken out of the world, but that they shall be kept safe within the world."
[time=2152] That is a very interesting qualification in light of some of the theology that we hear today.
[time=2158] One would get the impression, if you listen to much of the contemporary preaching that takes place in fundamental evangelical churches, that the success of the Christian life is to be found
[time=2170] in being taken away from the world.
[time=2172] We build our cloistered walls around us.
[time=2175] We spend all of our hours within the walls of the church.
[time=2178] We, as it were, build our own communities in order that we might shut the world out
[time=2184] and somehow almost literally go out of the world.
[time=2188] Every once in a while I read in a theological magazine about someone who has determined that they are going to build a "Christian community" where only Christians are allowed to live.
[time=2200] A sort of special place that is set apart from the world, set apart from all of the influences of the world.
[time=2208] I periodically hear Christians say, "Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful to live in such a place?" No, it wouldn't be wonderful because it would be in direct violation of the Word.
[time=2218] God has not given us the option of going out of the world.
[time=2222] He has simply allowed us to live victoriously in the midst of the world.
[time=2227] Someone has mentioned that three of the prayers of the Bible which were not answered
[time=2234] are the prayers of Elijah and Moses and Jonah
[time=2240] when they prayed that they would be taken out of the world.
[time=2244] All three of them said, "Lord, we want out of here." They were in dire distress and depression and deep anxiety and they prayed that they would be taken out of the world and their prayers were not answered.
[time=2255] And it's interesting to me as I read this passage of Scripture today and catch the heartbeat of the Savior that His prayer for me isn't that I will be separated from the world to the extent that it never touches my life and that I will be a permeating influence in the midst of it and that I will be kept from the evil one.
[time=2273] Now, there are two parts of this first petition.
[time=2276] First of all, there is the prayer that we be kept from the power of evil.
[time=2281] The word evil in the text, in order to be completely understood, needs to have the word "one" after it.
[time=2288] It is a masculine term which means to be kept from the evil one.
[time=2292] The evil influence certainly a reference to Satan.
[time=2295] Someone has said that Satan is the author.
[time=2298] The world is the bait and sin is the hook.
[time=2301] And we need to pray that God would keep us from the evil one.
[time=2307] That the author of confusion in our world, as he uses the world as bait
[time=2314] and his sin becomes the hook, would not have an influence in our lives, but that would be kept from him.
[time=2320] I remember reading some years ago a statement made by Winston Churchill during the war days when the troops over which he was in command
[time=2331] had successfully retreated in the line of fire and had gotten back behind the safety zone and were sequestered in the safety of the armory.
[time=2345] And everyone seemed to be filled with joy because they had had such a successful retreat.
[time=2350] Churchill in his gruff way stood before the troops to address them and he said, "We must be careful not to give the attributes of victory to a successful retreat."
[time=2365] Think of that for a moment.
[time=2367] He said, "We must be careful not to give the attributes of victory to a successful retreat.
[time=2374] As I look around at the Christian world today, I see many who feel that victory for them is a successful retreat from involvement in the world in which they live.
[time=2383] When they are able to retreat from it, not to have any part in it, not to ever touch it, they talk as if they have achieved a great victory." And I would say to you what Churchill said to his men, "We as Christians must be careful not ever to allow the attributes of victory
[time=2400] to be brought over and laid upon a successful retreat." Some of you are retreating from the world in the sense that you never touch the unbelievers.
[time=2408] You never touch the world that needs to be redeemed.
[time=2411] And as you look at your life, you consider it to be a successful Christian life.
[time=2415] The Word of God does not teach that.
[time=2417] The Word of God says that the heartbeat of the Savior is that as we live in the midst of this wicked and perverse generation, we will be permeating influences for Jesus Christ.
[time=2427] We will be successful in sharing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ with a world that knows Him not.
[time=2434] Notice that we are not to be taken out of the world, but we are to be kept within the world.
[time=2440] And 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 5 tells us that we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
[time=2452] You say, "Pastor, how is the prayer of the Savior answered?
[time=2455] How does someone like me with all of my old nature, all of the evil bent that I have, all of the tendency towards sin?
[time=2463] How can I live in a generation that is so degraded, so sensual,
[time=2469] so filled with materialism and secularism?
[time=2472] How can I live in the midst of that generation and be kept from the evil one?" Well, the key is not only found in the fact that the Savior prays for us, but it is also found in the fact that He is given to us the success key
[time=2487] for that to happen in our lives.
[time=2490] In this passage of Scripture beginning at verse 15, we have a cause and effect relationship.
[time=2496] He said, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.
[time=2503] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world, sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth." Now the word sanctify in this text is not a word which means inward cleansing, as it often does in the Old Testament.
[time=2519] The word sanctify simply understood is to set apart, to make special, to dedicate to a certain task.
[time=2528] It cannot mean inward cleansing, for in the 20th verse it is referred to in reference to Christ.
[time=2534] "I pray I for these alone, but for them who shall receive, who shall believe on me," and in verse 19 it says, "that they also might be sanctified through thy truth, for for their sakes I sanctify myself." And the Lord is not saying that He cleanses Himself, but that He sets Himself apart unto a task.
[time=2553] Verse 17 teaches that you and I are set apart in the midst of this world.
[time=2558] We are sanctified, and what is the answer by the word of truth?
[time=2564] It is the Bible, the word of God, infused in our lives that enables us to be faithfully answering the prayer of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2574] As He prays to the Father, set my people apart and keep them from the evil one.
[time=2579] He understands and communicates to us that that process is taken place in our own lives as God's word is allowed to permeate our lives and we are set apart by the word of truth.
[time=2591] In the text that we are studying, the word is used four times.
[time=2596] In verse 6 we read about the disciples who are kept by the word.
[time=2601] In verse 8 we read that they receive the word of God and acknowledge that it was from God.
[time=2606] Notice verse 14, "I have given them thy word, and because they received the word, the world hated them." And again in verse 17.
[time=2617] There are some today who tell us that the way we are to be victorious in the Christian life is to so separate ourselves from all that is happening in the world that we become isolationists.
[time=2629] There is a story of one Dionysius in the New Testament times who considered that the only way he could be holy was to isolate himself from all of the world and according to the story he followed the precedent of one who had gone before him by the name of Simon Stylitis and he built a platform on the top of a long pole and he sat upon that platform for three years handing down messages which he had received from on high and pulling his food up by a rope so that he could be separated from the world.
[time=2661] You say no one does anything quite that foolish these days and that's true, I don't know of anyone who's done that recently.
[time=2667] But as I look around at Christians today I discover that many of them think that the only way they can live in our world today is to shut themselves up from every influence that is around them and so they have become professional Christians interrelating only with other Christians and it isn't any wonder that they never win and they want to Christ because they don't know anyone who doesn't know Christ.
[time=2690] It is developed into our churches until it is quite the common thing in evangelical churches these days for them to have "evangelistic services." The only problem with it is nobody ever comes to the meetings who is unsaved and so they evangelize the evangelized and usually what happens about halfway through of the meeting the evangelist recognizes that he has no prospects so he takes one of two attacks.
[time=2716] First of all he tries to get all the saved people lost so he can get them saved again.
[time=2721] And if that doesn't work then he decides that the only other approach is to turn his evangelistic crusade into a Bible conference which is what it should have been called in the first place.
[time=2730] What has happened in our world that has caused us as Christians to think that the Lord Jesus put us down here just so that we could talk to one another.
[time=2739] He has put us in this world men and women that we might be the salt of the earth, that we might reach out to those who are lost and if there were no reason, if there were no purpose that was in line with that the only thing that would make any senses as soon as we were saved we'd be raptured and go home to be with the Lord.
[time=2755] If God didn't have a job for you to do and for me to do what would be the sense of us being here?
[time=2759] Living in this veil of tears, living in the anxiety that is ours.
[time=2763] This world is not our home, we're just pilgrims and strangers here.
[time=2766] But the reason is put us here men and women is that we might be redemptive influences in a world.
[time=2771] We're the only thing that's keeping this place from going up in smoke.
[time=2775] You know that?
[time=2780] And yet we misunderstand our mission. We were preaching last week about understanding our assignment.
[time=2785] I don't think some Christians know what their assignment is, just to fellowship.
[time=2789] My isn't it wonderful that we get together for fellowship.
[time=2793] Yeah, but that's not the task God has given us.
[time=2795] He has kept us in this world that we might penetrate this world for the cause of Jesus Christ.
[time=2801] Well, we are kept from the evil one. We are kept by the Word of God.
[time=2806] Thirdly, we are kept for the world.
[time=2810] There's a very interesting verse. It's verse 18 and it says this.
[time=2814] "As thou hast sent me into the world," now listen, listen now.
[time=2819] "Even so have I also sent them into the world."
[time=2825] Do you understand that? God said that as Christ was sent by the Father into this world,
[time=2832] even so you who have been chosen out of the world have now been sent back into the world.
[time=2838] You and I are on a mission into this world, not to retreat from it and in successfully retreating think we have had a victory.
[time=2845] But to go into the world with the gospel of Jesus Christ and to share with men and women how they can know what we have come to know.
[time=2853] Now, the pattern for it all is given to us in that verse.
[time=2857] It tells us that we are to go into the world as the Father sent Christ into this world and how did that happen?
[time=2862] Well, there are a number of things that happened when Christ came into this world.
[time=2866] He understood first of all that his mission was to reveal the Father.
[time=2871] And our mission as we come into this world is to reveal Christ to all who need to hear about him so that in seeing Christ they will see the Father.
[time=2879] As he came into this world, the Scripture says that he understood his mission was to seek and to save that which was lost.
[time=2886] And he has sent us into the world with the same mission to seek and to save that which was lost.
[time=2892] Christ came into this world and we are told that he was full of grace and truth.
[time=2897] And we are to go into our world as gracious ambassadors of the truth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2903] Christ came into this world as a holy one in the midst of corruption and we are to go into our world as men and women who are committed to holy, righteous living even though the world around us seems not to understand anything at all of that term.
[time=2917] He came into this world as the light of the world.
[time=2920] And he says in the book of John that even though he was the light of the world as long as he was in the world when he went back to heaven we have become luminaries reflecting his light to the world around us.
[time=2932] He was the light in his world, were to be the light in our world.
[time=2936] Jesus Christ came into this world furnished with the Spirit of God as the source of his power and likewise we go out into our world with the Spirit of God living within us giving us the power to be a witness for his sake.
[time=2950] Jesus Christ understood as we have learned so far that he was to be about his Father's business.
[time=2956] He lived on a divine time schedule, he accomplished the work which his Father gave him to do and as he has been sent into this world even so have we been sent into our world.
[time=2966] If I were to ask you today how many of you have men and women who are unsaved for whom you pray and with whom you spend time for the purpose of cultivating them for the Lord Jesus Christ how many of you could give me more than one name?
[time=2981] Or have you so filled your life with fellowship you've forgotten what your purpose is?
[time=2986] Someone has said that the church ought to be like a group of paratroopers who gather together for instruction and then are dropped behind the lines during the week to penetrate the enemy lines and to win victories for Christ and then come back together for encouragement before they go out again the next time.
[time=3004] And if we had translated that in terms of our experience today most of us never get outside the walls we just fellowship we just meet and God has prayed that we might be kept from the evil one kept by the word of God kept that we might penetrate the world for Jesus Christ.
[time=3023] I want you to notice secondly not only his petition for us but I want you to notice the purpose for this happening.
[time=3032] There are two purposes one in verse 11 and one in verse 13 and we learn as we study the Bible that we know purposes by the word that.
[time=3040] The word that often introduces a purpose clause verse 11 says this and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father keep through thine own name those that thou has given me and here's the purpose that they may be one as we are.
[time=3059] The Lord Jesus prayed that you and I might be kept in the midst of the world so that we would have unity not only with each other but with our Father in heaven and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3070] Throughout this passage of scripture there are several different indications of our oneness with the Godhead and I want to show them to you quickly so you can understand that our being in this world and being kept in the midst of this situation down here
[time=3085] in a very wonderful way unites us with the Godhead so that as they are we are first of all we are alike in spirit and in aim.
[time=3096] Verse 11 says I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to see and I come to the Holy Father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are just as he is not in the world physically
[time=3111] but is spiritually so we are not in this world in the sense that we are of it but we are present in it and so in that way we cooperate with the Godhead.
[time=3121] The second one is found in verse 14 where we read I have given them thy word and the world hates them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
[time=3131] Just as the world ill treated the Lord because he was not of them so we ought to expect that on occasion we will be ill treated because we are not of the world.
[time=3140] We are alike in mission verse 18 we've already looked at says just as the Lord was sent into the world you and I have been sent into the world so we have a oneness with the Lord in our mission as we have gone out to win men and women to Christ.
[time=3155] Verse 23 of chapter 17 says I am them and thou and me that they might be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me
[time=3168] as the Father loved the Son and the Son loves us we and then love the world and we cooperate in the Godhead in that wonderful way.
[time=3179] Jesus prayed I want them to be kept from the evil one kept by the word of God kept and thrust into the world that there may be a unity between them and between them and us.
[time=3192] Men and women we are never so one as a body as when we are cooperating with God's plan for our life here in this world.
[time=3201] We are never so one with the Father as we are when the heartbeat of God for a lost world is being translated into our daily actions as we walk to and fro upon the face of this world.
[time=3212] There is a unity which comes that is a unity of like precious faith and like precious task.
[time=3220] And if men and women today would catch hold of the vision of God for a dying world that's on its way to hell and get caught up in the passion that Christ has for those who are lost there wouldn't many time for the Mickey Mouse differences that are always being fought and has sold among the Christians.
[time=3238] If we could catch hold of the passion of Christ we would be so busy out telling men and women of the Savior and trying to reach our world for the Lord we wouldn't have time for the petty jealousies and differences that grow up when Christians gather.
[time=3252] He promised us that if we would follow his instruction we would be one. Secondly I want you to notice that the purpose of our being kept from the world by the word is that we might have joy.
[time=3267] Verse 13 is another purpose clause and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[time=3279] There's a wonderful thought here just as the Savior found joy and obedience to the Father as he came into this world. He has given us the task of going into the world in his behalf and he has promised that in doing so there will be joy manifested in us and it is his joy fulfilled in our lives.
[time=3297] The Savior is praying for us today and his prayer is directly related to our involvement in the world in which we live.
[time=3307] Can we be a part of that prayer being answered at the Black Hawk Baptist Church in the world where you live? Can you touch your world for Christ and be an answer to the Savior's prayer?
[time=3323] Shall we pray? Father in heaven forgive us for our isolationist attitudes about our world. We understand that we're not to participate in that which is worldly.
[time=3336] But oh God you've called us to love a world without Christ and we have failed. We are not even keeping up with those who are being born into this world in terms of telling them of the gospel.
[time=3349] Many of us are so concerned about fellowship that we have no time to be obedient to the Great Commission.
[time=3358] Lord we pray that you will burn within our hearts a desire to touch our world for Christ, that as we look up into thy face on that final day when we shall give an account of the deeds done in the flesh,
[time=3371] we will be able to say that we have done all we could to be a representative of Jesus Christ in the world for which He died.
