[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - First Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=68] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=107] - Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=119] And we rejoice at the opportunity of welcoming you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, those of us gathered here in the auditorium, and all of you who have joined us now by way of television.
[time=131] It is a beautiful summer day here in Fort Wayne, and we are rejoicing in the beautiful weather.
[time=138] We have sunshine on the outside, and we have sunshine on the inside of our hearts because of our love for Christ and the joy we have at being together with Him and with God's people.
[time=150] I trust that this hour will be a time of encouragement and inspiration, a time of challenge.
[time=155] We'll be looking in a few moments into the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=159] Our special guest today is Mr. George Omen, visited with us not too long ago.
[time=164] He is a part of the Omen brass.
[time=166] He's an outstanding trumpeter, and he's going to be sharing in music with us during the services this Lord's Day.
[time=173] Right now we listen to the ministry of our choir.
[time=203] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=434] And in the experiences that we face in our lives, it's a wonderful thing to know of the sovereignty of God, that in the pressures and difficulties of life he's in control.
[time=444] All of us who are believers and have lived, any experience at all in the Christian life can say an amen to the message of our choir this morning.
[time=452] Mr. George Omen is a young man who has become early in life very proficient on the trumpet.
[time=459] His family is known all across this country for their beautiful music.
[time=465] The Omen brass has recorded a number of albums.
[time=468] They perform in many of the Bible conference centers across this land.
[time=473] And George Omen has become a friend of our church through our youth intern who has brought him to us and introduced him to us.
[time=482] And we're so grateful that Craig Pearson brought him home from Moody one weekend so we could get acquainted with him and we're glad to have him back today.
[time=490] He's going to play for us now. George, welcome.
[time=494] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=623] We're so grateful for every one of you who join us each week on the Bible Hour.
[time=627] And we especially appreciate the opportunity that Don and I have to sit together with you in your living room during this particular time in the telecast and talk with you personally as if we would if we really had knocked at your door and had come in to sit down with you personally.
[time=642] We're grateful for the opportunity we have to share with you both the blessings, the joys and the needs of this television program.
[time=651] Down to this week I got a letter from a man who is serving time in the Illinois Correctional Institution
[time=658] who watches the Bible Hour every Sunday in prison.
[time=662] And he told me in the letter that he had received Christ two years ago and the Bible Hour was being used by God to strengthen and encourage him in his daily growth.
[time=671] He asked if he could be a member of the Founders Club even though he was in prison.
[time=675] And that blessed my heart and encouraged me because frankly there's no other way we could reach behind the bars of the correctional institutions
[time=682] to touch the lives of individuals.
[time=684] That's one of the blessings that we receive and we received many from prisons of men who watch and share the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=692] Some of the needs that we have are centered during this time around the support of the television ministry
[time=698] and especially in the sponsors program.
[time=700] You have a blessing to share and I think you ought to do that.
[time=704] We have encouraged people who view the Bible Hour to sponsor the program in their area on a given Sunday.
[time=711] And today we have a sponsor on channel 38 in Chicago.
[time=716] And it's Mr. John Organtine and our thanks go to Mr. Organtine for providing the money for the Bible Hour to be seen in Chicago today.
[time=725] Down to the sponsors program is not an attempt on our part to become individually involved in underwriting the telecast.
[time=733] It's an attempt on our part to become involved personally with individuals who want to help us be a part of spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=741] And we're so grateful to the many people who have helped us in full sponsorship and also for the many who have helped in the associate sponsorship program.
[time=750] The associate sponsorship program is available to those who can make a gift of $100 to the television ministry
[time=757] and help to underwrite a telecast in one of the five areas where this television program is seen.
[time=763] If you'd be interested in helping us by becoming a sponsor or an associate sponsor, we'd be happy to hear from you this week.
[time=771] In the mail this week Mr. Organtine will receive a specially engraved plaque with his name on it, a picture of the pastor and some encouragement from the Bible Hour office as a remembrance of the gift that he's given.
[time=784] And those who participate in the associate sponsorship program receive a very special certificate that has their name inscribed on it which I personally sign and it is sent with a letter of appreciation to all who help us.
[time=796] During these summer months it's very important that we hear from many of you.
[time=800] We would encourage you to write us and let us know of your support of the Bible Hour television program.
[time=807] During these days our special gift offer is a little booklet and I'm especially excited about this and I know you feel the same way Donna.
[time=815] Our booklet for this month is the answer book and it's a grouping of scriptures on any given subject.
[time=824] If you have a question about guilt or sorrow, if you've lost a loved one and you need comfort,
[time=831] if you open up this book it has God's answer to those problems and it has the scripture and the scripture is written out for you
[time=839] so you don't have to look it up in the Bible, it's written out there completely for you.
[time=844] Donna, sometimes in the world in which we live today it just takes a lot of courage to face each day.
[time=849] I was interested especially in the little answer book on the verses that relate to the subject of courage.
[time=855] Sometimes we have decisions that need to be made and problems that we have to face.
[time=859] And it's just great to know that there are passages in the Word of God that deal with what it means to be spiritually courageous.
[time=867] That's one of my favorite pages in this book and those are some of my favorite verses where the Lord tells us to be strong
[time=873] and of a good courage, be not dismayed, neither be afraid, for the Lord thy God is with thee, with us whoever thou goest.
[time=880] And the courageous passages will be a favorite page in this book of scripture for many of our friends.
[time=886] Now you can receive your free answer book if you will write to us this week.
[time=891] You cannot buy this in any of the bookstores, it has been prepared specially for the Bible, our television program,
[time=898] but we'd be happy to send one to you if you'll write to us. Why don't you share with them how to get in touch with us?
[time=904] If you would like to have your free copy of the answer book, all you need to do is jot a line to pastor David Jeremiah,
[time=911] post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=918] Just tell us that you viewed the Bible hour and on what channel you've seen it and that you would like your free copy of the answer book.
[time=926] And of course there is no charge for this booklet, but we do remind all of you that it is your prayer
[time=932] and your financial support that makes it possible for the Bible hour to continue on your station.
[time=937] If you can enclose a gift to help in the cost of television, we appreciate it so much.
[time=942] Now I trust that you'll stay with us through the remaining moments of this television program.
[time=947] In just a moment we'll be turning again to the book of John chapter 17 to share a message from the Word of God.
[time=953] May his richest blessing be upon you as you share the remaining moments of the Bible hour today.
[time=983] (Music)
[time=998] And what?
[time=1000] (Music)
[time=1040] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1043] Our tenured soloist Ron Hackett comes now and sings a song that has a tremendous message.
[time=1049] I remember the very first time I ever used this.
[time=1052] I used a choir arrangement of it when I was in Toledo, Ohio.
[time=1056] And some of my choir members told me that they could not sing this song honestly and asked if I would not let them sing that song that particular night.
[time=1065] It says very, very much.
[time=1068] I want you to listen to it and I trust you can say it to in your own heart.
[time=1072] Whatever it takes.
[time=1075] (Music)
[time=1097] There's a voice calling me from an old rocketry.
[time=1107] And with first rockers certain.
[time=1116] May this world far behind, there are new highs to climb and a new place.
[time=1128] In you will be heard, for whatever it takes.
[time=1140] To draw closer to you low.
[time=1146] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1156] For whatever it takes to be more like you.
[time=1167] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1176] (Music)
[time=1204] For whatever it takes to be more like you.
[time=1210] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1217] Oh, take the dear things to be.
[time=1222] If that's how it was made, to draw me closer to thee.
[time=1235] Let the disappointments come, lovely days without the sun if in sun, or like you I'll become.
[time=1254] Take my houses and lands, change my dreams and my plans, for I'm placing my whole life in your hands.
[time=1272] And if you call me someday to one land far away, what I'll go?
[time=1284] Then you will obey.
[time=1291] For whatever it takes to draw closer to you low.
[time=1301] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1310] For whatever it takes to be more like you.
[time=1320] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1328] I'll trade sunshine or rain.
[time=1334] Come forward for me.
[time=1339] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1347] For whatever it takes for my will to break.
[time=1358] That's what I'll be willing to do.
[time=1385] I can understand why there were some who didn't want to sing those words.
[time=1397] Just before the message, Marilyn Wong is going to share with us in the same vein that has been a part of all of our service,
[time=1405] preparation of our lives and our hearts.
[time=1408] She's going to sing a prayer that I hope is the prayer for all of us who are Christians, all to be likely, and may it be our prayer as she sings it for us.
[time=1426] Oh, to be likely, less every dimmer.
[time=1438] This is my constant longing and prayer.
[time=1449] Gladly I'll forget all of us treasures.
[time=1462] Jesus, I perfect like this to live.
[time=1477] Oh, to be likely, less every dimmer.
[time=1496] You as the Lord come in thy sweetness.
[time=1509] Come in thy fullness.
[time=1516] Stamp thine own image deep on my heart.
[time=1532] Oh, to be likely, less compassion.
[time=1544] Loving for giving, tender and kind.
[time=1557] Helping the helpless.
[time=1563] Sharing the fainting.
[time=1569] Seeking the wandering.
[time=1576] Sinner to fly.
[time=1585] Oh, to be likely.
[time=1593] You to be likely, less every dimmer.
[time=1605] You as the Lord come in thy sweetness.
[time=1618] Come in thy fullness.
[time=1626] Stamp thine own image deep on my heart.
[time=1647] Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1657] And I trust that's the prayer of your heart.
[time=1661] We not always are excited about the means that God uses to make that happen.
[time=1667] Maybe you're not quite at the place yet where you can pray the prayer that Ron sang.
[time=1672] But I hope that in all of our hearts there is a deep-seated desire to be like Christ.
[time=1677] Because without the desire it will never take place.
[time=1681] That is the first and foremost ingredient that God uses to make us like unto himself.
[time=1686] A deep-seated hunger to know him and to be like him.
[time=1691] Your Bibles are open today to the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=1696] John chapter 17. And I want to read for our lesson from the Word of God today.
[time=1704] Just one verse from John 17.
[time=1708] John chapter 17 verse 24.
[time=1712] You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1716] Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am.
[time=1723] That they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world.
[time=1733] Shall we pray?
[time=1735] Lord, our hearts have been ministered to already in this service this morning.
[time=1742] As we have listened to our choir, the ministry of music from the soloists,
[time=1749] we have heard the words that have been presented to us.
[time=1754] As we have thought through the message of the song that we heard instrumentally,
[time=1761] and all of these words and the impact of this total message has come in upon our consciousness,
[time=1769] we are aware of the fact that already the Spirit of God has prepared the way for the seed of God's word
[time=1776] to be dropped into fertile soil.
[time=1779] We ask that you will clear our minds in these next moments from those things which would detract us,
[time=1785] cause us to be able to hear from heaven by means of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Word of God.
[time=1791] And Lord, we ask that we will not be today simply collectors of information, but we shall take the word which we hear and apply it to our own lives and go forth from here,
[time=1802] not just hearers of the word, but doers too.
[time=1806] We pray in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=1813] In a small bungalow in Lakeport, New Hampshire,
[time=1819] our two people who are very important to me and to whom I owe a great deal.
[time=1827] They are the parents of my wife, Donna, Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Thompson.
[time=1833] Their home looks out over the bay, which is a part of the beautiful Winnipasake Lake,
[time=1841] the largest inland lake contained in one state.
[time=1844] It is a beautiful spot where they live, and I can tell you that these past days have been very busy and exciting days for the Thompson family.
[time=1854] These next days will be special days for them because their children are coming home for a visit.
[time=1862] And though I cannot see into that home, I can just about tell you what has been happening there during the past week.
[time=1869] The aroma of raisin-filled cookies and tall house cookies has filled the little bungalow
[time=1876] and the jars that station themselves around the kitchen are gradually being filled up
[time=1882] for the onslaught of the Jeremiah family.
[time=1887] Mr. Thompson is busily at work in those grandfatherly tasks that he so loves puttering around in the garage, making sure everything is just exactly right when the family comes home.
[time=1902] There is nothing in all of the world that is more exciting to a father and mother
[time=1909] than for the children to be at home.
[time=1914] There is nothing that brings joy to a family any more than the joy of preparing to be with those we love.
[time=1923] And while the preparation is taking place out there on the east coast for the advent of the children,
[time=1931] preparation is taking place in the hearts of those of us who will be joining with them in just a few days.
[time=1937] Anticipation, excitement, somehow it's almost hard to keep our head in the game here
[time=1944] when we know we're going to be going there.
[time=1948] As I thought about the passage that we are to study today and the events in our own personal lives, the two of them seem to come together in some way to be able to teach, first of all, me a lesson and hopefully all of us a lesson as we share these truths together.
[time=1963] We have been studying the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=1967] In it is the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ in behalf of those whom he loved.
[time=1974] There are seven petitions that are contained in this portion of God's Word.
[time=1979] Seven times Jesus Christ asks the Father for something.
[time=1984] In verse one he prays that he might be glorified as the Son who has glorified the Father.
[time=1990] In verse five he prays that the glory he had eternally would be restored to him.
[time=1996] In verses 11 and 15 he prays that the believers in this world would be kept from evil and from the evil one.
[time=2004] In verse 17 he prays that the believers might be sanctified.
[time=2009] In verses 21 to 23 his prayer is that the believers might be one, that they might be unified.
[time=2016] In verse 21 he prayed that the world might believe on him.
[time=2022] But the height of all of his requests and the pinnacle of it all is found in the 24th verse
[time=2028] where he prays that the believers may be with him in heaven to behold and to share his glory.
[time=2036] This seventh request from the lips of our Lord in his high priestly prayer is above and beyond all of the requests that he has made to this point.
[time=2046] In the first six requests he is praying about that which is to take place here on this earth
[time=2052] the blessings that would accrue to the believers. All of the things that he prayed in request one through six
[time=2058] had to do with believers here on the earth.
[time=2062] All but when he comes to that last request he moves out of the sphere of the earth and into the sphere of the heavenly and he prays that believers might be with him in glory.
[time=2074] Though Christ offered this prayer while he was on earth he prayed the prayer as if he were already in heaven.
[time=2081] Someone has noted that he had prayed himself into such an exaltation that he did not know that he was not yet ascended unto his Father.
[time=2090] Would God that we could know something of that intensity in our prayer that we could pray in such intensity that we would forget where we were and literally be lifted up into the heights of glory as was the Savior.
[time=2104] The prayer that he prayed is a prayer full of meaning for all of us.
[time=2110] It is a prayer which has a special significance to those of you who during past days have bid farewell to someone that you love.
[time=2119] It is a prayer from the Savior that all of his children would be gathered home to be with him.
[time=2128] It is a prayer which is filled with earthly significance because it touches all of us.
[time=2134] It is a prayer which is filled with heavenly significance because it relates to our home in heaven with God.
[time=2142] Now as we examine this prayer there are a number of things that we must notice if the prayer is to have all of the meaning that it should have to our own hearts.
[time=2151] The first thing that I want you to note is the person to whom the prayer is given.
[time=2156] Jesus prayed in verse 24, Father.
[time=2161] It is interesting to note as you look throughout the chapter that there are a number of titles that he uses in the midst of his prayer.
[time=2168] First of all, back in the 11th verse he addressed the Father as Holy Father.
[time=2173] Down at the end of the prayer in verse 25 he addresses the Father as righteous Father.
[time=2179] A couple of times in the prayer he uses the term "o Father." But here in verse 24 he uses the simple address "Father."
[time=2190] And it seems so appropriate that he would use that term, for he is talking about a gathering in the Father's house and so he addresses his request to the Father himself.
[time=2201] It is filled with that familial recognition that immediately causes us to identify his prayer with our earthly fathers with whom we relate.
[time=2212] Jesus addressed him simply as Father and it is right that it should be that way.
[time=2218] It is right because it is to the Father we will go.
[time=2221] It is right because it is natural for us to think of heaven as a place where we are gathered unto our Father.
[time=2228] To be absent from the Father is not natural and to be gathered back to him is the most exciting and natural thing that can happen in the life of a Christian.
[time=2238] When someone asks you about that one you have lost, when someone says to you, "Is your husband deceased? Is your wife no longer living? What do you answer?"
[time=2249] Well, let me suggest that the Christian ought to answer in light of this prayer.
[time=2253] My wife, my husband, my child is not here. They have gone to be with the Father.
[time=2259] That, to me, has a ring of a positive note in it even though it does not neglect the sadness of separation we face when someone we love has taken from us.
[time=2269] To say with exultation, "My loved one has gone to the Father," is to say that he lives on, that she lives on in the presence of a very natural situation for it is right to natural and proper for children to be with the Father.
[time=2285] I want you to notice, secondly, not only the person of the Father, the person of this request, but I want you to notice the power in this request.
[time=2295] Jesus said, "Father, I will." That they be brought to me. He did not say I pray. That's words that are found in the text in other places.
[time=2307] But he said, "I will." Now, someone says to me, "When does someone go to be with the Father?" This past week, someone said to me, "Pastor Jeremiah, what happens when a person dies?
[time=2319] Do they wait someplace to see the Father or do they go to be with the Father?"
[time=2325] Well, the Bible in the words of Paul says that there comes a time when we are absent from the body and present with the Lord.
[time=2332] So when a Christian dies, his body goes in the grave and his spirit soul goes to be with the Father, with Jesus.
[time=2341] It is trite and almost lacking in dignity, but someone has illustrated this through the use of an epitaph that was found on an old gravestone,
[time=2350] concerning the death of a man by the name of Mr. Pease.
[time=2354] And it goes like this, here lies the body of old man Pease, down underneath the flowers and the trees, but Pease ain't here, just the pod. Pease shelled out and gone to God.
[time=2369] That's what happens when someone dies. Pease shelled out and gone to God. When I die, my body goes in the grave, but praise the Lord, my spirit goes to be with the Lord.
[time=2383] And immediately this prayer takes effect upon the death of every Christian. The Father answers the request of the Savior when a Christian dies,
[time=2394] and that loved one is gathered into the presence of the Lord. Now notice how strong is his prayer. He says, "Father, I will."
[time=2404] The Lord says, "It is my desire, it is my purpose, it is my will, that those who thou hast given to me be brought to me so that we might be together."
[time=2413] There are a number of things about this expression, "I will," that are important. The assurance that all God's children will get to heaven is inherent in those two words.
[time=2424] Sometimes people say, "Is it possible to be saved and not ever arrive at heaven?" Well, it's only possible if the will of the Savior isn't accomplished.
[time=2432] For he says, "I will, that all those that thou hast given to me, be with me where I am." And the Savior's will is not something that you can change when he wills it, it happens.
[time=2445] Caught up in this phrase are a number of thoughts. First of all, there is the thought of intercession. You cannot hold your Father. He is in heaven.
[time=2455] He is there where you are going to be, but if the will of the Savior is expressed in his intercession, someday you will have a hold of your Father in personal fellowship and you shall be with him.
[time=2467] Though he is spirit, you shall understand and relate to him as you have not before. There is caught up in this prayer, not just an intercession, but I could not help but see here that it reflected a testament or a bequest.
[time=2481] The Lord Jesus is about to die, and he says, "I want to read my will. My will is this, that all of the children that God has given to me be gathered to be with me in heaven."
[time=2494] And someone has said that Jesus Christ is the one who could in a very special way make sure that his will took place. First of all, he died to make his will valid, and then he rose again to be the executor of his own will.
[time=2509] And so having died, he validated the will, having resurrected from the grave. He is now the executor of that will to make sure that all God's children who have been born into the family of God will one day be with him in glory.
[time=2522] It is an expression of force. It is an expression of purpose. Isn't it interesting that one of the reasons people die and go to heaven is so that they might be answering the prayer of the Savior who prayed, "Father, it's my will that all those you have given to me be with me where I am."
[time=2543] I want you to notice not only the person of the prayer and the power of the prayer, but notice the perspective of the prayer.
[time=2553] He says, "They also whom thou hast given me." Now in the 17th chapter, seven times the Lord Jesus Christ refers to Christians as those whom the Father has given to him. You will find it two times in verse two, as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
[time=2578] You will find it two times in verse six. I have manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gave us to me out of the world, thine they were, and thou gave us them to me. You will find it in verse nine. I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me.
[time=2596] You will find it in verse 11. I am now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to the Holy Father, keep through thy own name, those whom thou hast given me. And in verse 12, while I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name.
[time=2612] Those that thou gave us to me, I have kept, and you will find it again in verse 24. The verse we have just read, "Father, I will, that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me." The Bible teaches that Christians are God's love gift to the Savior, that you and I, when we are born into God's family, are a part of God's wonderful love gift that he has given to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2640] as an expression of his love for the Savior. And now the prayer is this, that the believers who are God's love gift to Christ are the ones who are to be gathered to be with the Father when the appropriate time comes.
[time=2658] Now what is the meaning of the perspective of this prayer? Well, let me point out to you first of all that there is no room in this request for unbelievers. The Lord Jesus did not pray, "Father, I will, that all men everywhere, be with me where I am." No, there's no room in this request for those who are outside of Christ. Only those who have been given by God the Father to Jesus Christ the Son are those who participate in the answering of this prayer.
[time=2687] Men and women, if you do not know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you will not participate in this prayer. If you have not put your trust in Jesus Christ by inviting him into your life and acknowledging yourself as a sinner and reaching out to receive his grace, which is full and free, you will never participate in being with the Father where he is and with Christ where he is, for you cannot be a part of the answer to this prayer until first of all you were born into God's family.
[time=2716] I want to say secondly that in this prayer there is no place for an intermediate state of the dead. There is no purgatory in this prayer. The Lord did not pray, "Oh Father, I pray that all of those who have died and are waiting in some intermediate state be with me where I am." He did not give us a clue that we could pray for those who had already died that they might go to Heaven. There is no evidence of that in the Bible and to pray for someone who is dead that they might be saved.
[time=2745] Is wasting your breath. Salvation is now in this time period. Now is the day of salvation. And there is no room in this prayer for anyone to pray that those who have already died will somehow go to Heaven. Men and women, the time to be concerned about that is in this life while we breathe and live. That's the opportunity God has given us to participate in this prayer.
[time=2769] He said, "Holy Father, Father, I pray that those that thou hast given to me will be with me where I am." And that is the perspective of the prayer.
[time=2782] I want to say again, if you are not a Christian, you have no hope of Heaven. If you don't know Christ as your personal Savior, Heaven is a dream, but it's not a reality.
[time=2793] God has given to us in His Word the opportunity of reaching out by faith to accept His plan, and the Bible tells us quite clearly what His plan is.
[time=2804] The Bible tells us that eternal life is to be found in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, and this is life eternal, even Jesus Christ.
[time=2813] If you do not know Jesus Christ, then the Savior cannot include you in His prayer that you be with Him where He is.
[time=2820] I want you to notice, fourthly, the purpose of His request. Why is it that the Savior prays that we will be with Him in Heaven?
[time=2828] There are two purposes in this verse that He gives to us, both of them introduced by the word that, which is a purpose phrase, which tells us why He wants us to be in Heaven with Him.
[time=2840] First of all, he says, "Father, I will, that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am."
[time=2849] The Lord desires the fellowship of His children, even now as Mr. and Mrs. Thompson wait with expectation over in Lake Port, New Hampshire, and they've checked off the days of the calendar to know when we're going to be there to be with them.
[time=2863] The Father in Heaven awaits the day when He will have the intimate, perfect fellowship of His children, and though I cannot in my finite mind understand how He relates to all of us individually, as our parents relate to us as children because He is the infinite God, it is every bit as important that one of us be there as it is that another be there.
[time=2885] And He prays does the Savior that we will be with Him where He is.
[time=2893] Is that not the prayer that is contained in the words of the Savior which are recorded in the 14th chapter of John?
[time=2901] Let not your heart be troubled, you believe in God, believe also in me.
[time=2906] In my Father's house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again to receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.
[time=2924] And now it's incorporated into the prayer, Father, I pray, that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.
[time=2932] Is that not the record in the book of 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, when Paul instructing the church at Thessalonica said, there's coming a day when the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised, and those who have died in Christ shall be brought up first,
[time=2948] and then those of us who are alive and remain shall be caught up together to be with them, and then what does the text say?
[time=2954] And so shall we ever be with the Lord?
[time=2959] People ask me what is heaven like, and I can't answer it in exact terms, but I can say this in this prayer, and in the promise of John 14, and in Paul's instruction in 1 Thessalonians 4, heaven is the epitome of fellowship with Jesus.
[time=2974] It is to be with him where he is, and men and women, that means a place, a specific place, it is not a state of mind, it is not some exuberant feeling, it is not something that we dream about, a figment or an extension of our mental process, it is a place where he is where I'm going to be when I die.
[time=2999] And the purpose of my being with him is that I might enjoy his fellowship, that I might know even as I'm known, but notice secondly the second purpose is that we might behold his glory.
[time=3011] Is it not like Jesus Christ to want to include us in his moment of glory?
[time=3016] There is coming a day when the Savior is going to be exalted, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of God the Father, and he wants his children to be there when that happens.
[time=3030] He said to Jeremiah, you don't deserve it, but I want you to be there in my big moment when I am glorified so that you can see my glory and share in the joy that I share.
[time=3043] And that's a family truth, isn't it?
[time=3046] My wife and I some months ago were down in Dallas where we went to school, and we were driving around through the streets, looking at the different places where we had spent time.
[time=3057] This restaurant here and that house there and that place where we used to go on occasion.
[time=3062] And I said to her, you know, honey, the joy of our relationship is the joy of being able to look back and remember things that we did together.
[time=3071] To remember the joys that we shared together, isn't it like the Father?
[time=3077] To answer the request of the Son, that is children, might be able to share the moment of glory in heaven.
[time=3084] I don't want to miss that. I don't want to miss that moment when all the angel choirs will sing, and the four and twenty elders will be leading the praise and all of the martyrs of the past days and all of the Old Testament people and all of the New Testament people bring honor and glory to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3102] And Christ is praying, Father, I want my children all there when I am glorified, that they might see my glory.
[time=3112] That's the purpose of his prayer.
[time=3118] I can't help but see in this passage of Scripture that the atmosphere of this whole text is the atmosphere of love.
[time=3127] What is it that's so true of the Father's house? Why it's a place of love.
[time=3133] It's the place where the children are loved in the way they aren't loved any place else. Why it takes me two weeks to recover from being at grandma's house with my children.
[time=3143] They so spoil them and let them buy with things we'd never let them buy with.
[time=3147] It takes two weeks to get them squared away when I get home because they just love them.
[time=3151] They don't know anything at all except to shower love on them.
[time=3154] Well, you notice what the Bible says. Verse 23, Jesus said, "Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me."
[time=3164] Jesus said that God loves us in the same way that he loved his own Son.
[time=3169] There is a fellowship of love in the Father's house.
[time=3173] And if you will continue reading, you will notice in verse 25, "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me,
[time=3183] in other words there is a relationship here between the Father and the Son and the children."
[time=3191] And then in verse 24 at the end of the text he says, "For thou loveest me before the foundation of the world."
[time=3198] In the Father's house there's love.
[time=3200] And when we get to be with the Father, when we are the answer to the request of the Savior, we will be in a house of love.
[time=3208] Remember that He gave Jesus the Father gave to Jesus the Church as His love gift.
[time=3216] And the Father gave Jesus Christ to us as His love gift to us.
[time=3220] And so throughout all of this passage, and in all of the discussion, the Father's house is a place of love.
[time=3230] Now that does not reduce the pain of someone who has departed,
[time=3236] but does it not help us to understand that it is eternally in the perspective of God to reach down and on occasion answer the prayer of the Savior?
[time=3249] One day He will answer it completely, but here and there, now and again, this year in our church, sometimes in your family,
[time=3256] God the Father reaches down and answers to the prayer of the Savior and takes one of His children to be with Him at home.
[time=3265] If we could see it from their perspective how different it would be, what a change would come to our thinking.
[time=3273] A little boy was taken from his parents on a time gone by, and the mother thought through the whole experience,
[time=3282] and finally she got God's perspective on it and she said, "You know, I miss my little one."
[time=3290] But I could not ask Him to trade the joys of His fellowship with the Father for His playthings here on earth.
[time=3298] I could not ask Him to throw away His harp and the friends that He has in heaven and the fellowship in the bosom of the Father,
[time=3309] and come to be a boy again to live and to laugh and to weep and to love and to suffer and to die and perhaps to be lost.
[time=3319] And as she contemplated the thought of the Father's house as opposed to the house where that young man lived,
[time=3326] she penned these words which somehow, though they touch at our heartstrings, put it all in perspective.
[time=3333] She wrote, "I am all alone in my chamber now, and the midnight hour is near, and the faggots crack and the clocks dull tick
[time=3343] over my soul in its solitude, sweet feelings of sadness glide, for my heart and my eyes are full when I think of the little boy that died.
[time=3353] I went one night to my Father's house, went home to the dear one's all, and softly I opened the garden gate and softly the door of the hall.
[time=3361] My mother came out to meet her son, she kissed me, and then she sighed, and her head fell on my neck and she wept for the little boy that died.
[time=3369] I shall miss him when the flowers come and the garden where he played.
[time=3373] I shall miss him more by the fireside when the flowers have all decayed.
[time=3378] I shall see the toys and his empty chair and the horse they used to ride, and they will speak with a silent speech of the little boy that died.
[time=3387] We shall go home to our Father's house, to our Father's house in the skies, where the hope of our souls shall have no blight, our love no broken ties.
[time=3396] We shall roam on the banks of the river of peace and bathe in its blissful tide, and one of the joys of our heaven shall be the little boy that died.
[time=3407] And somehow when we hear that, somehow when we think about it from that perspective, we understand why the Savior prayed that his children would be with him and the family would be at home.
[time=3423] Shall we pray?

[time=3533] The Bible hour has been made possible by the members of the Founders Club.
[time=3538] The Founders Club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach ministry.
[time=3553] First of all, of everyone here in this auditorium, how many of you, could I ask, have some dear loved one invested in heaven already?
[time=3563] Could I see your hands? Some dear loved one invested in heaven already.
[time=3568] God bless you and may put him down.
[time=3570] Large percentage of hands raised.
[time=3573] Heaven is going to be Jesus Christ first of all, but it's also going to be a time of reunion and a time of fellowship with those who have gone on before us.
[time=3582] Those who will love.
[time=3584] Now let me ask this second question.
[time=3587] How many of you can say with a shield?
