[time=0] (bell ringing) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=29] Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=36] (choir singing) - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=60] And with the singing of that great hymn of praise, we began this portion of our service, which is now shared with our many friends who participate in the worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church through television.
[time=75] We're grateful that all of you could share with us today, and we have a good group of folks gathered here for worship in the sanctuary.
[time=82] We've had a great hour in Sunday school, and we've come to this time, anticipating the blessing of the Lord upon us.
[time=88] As always, we have some good music to inspire and encourage your heart, and then a message from the Word of God in the last message in a series of messages from the 17th chapter of the Book of John.
[time=101] Right now, we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir, and they're singing for us a song, which is part of an album that was recently recorded by the choir, the music of Mr. Bill Gaither, and the song is entitled, "Worthy the Lamb." (dramatic music)
[time=148] [MUSIC - 248 seconds]
[time=410] (dramatic music) - Thank you, Choir, that hymn inspired
[time=425] by the great hymns of the Book of Revelation reminds us of the song that we will sing to the Lord someday when we gather around the throne in praise of His worthy name.
[time=437] Now we're going to listen to the ministry of star Narwhal as she reminds us that the one who is worthy has a personal relationship to all of us who know Him when we come into a personal relationship with Him and He becomes the Lord of our life, He becomes everything to us.
[time=454] That's the testimony of her heart as she shares it in music with us now.
[time=458] (upbeat music)
[time=465] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=633] - Thank you so much for joining us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=636] Normally, my wife Donna would be here to share this time together with us, but she is with the rest of our family vacationing in New Hampshire, and I hope to join her very shortly and spend a few days of relaxation as we prepare for the fall schedule.
[time=650] During these past few days, we have been very excited about the response of many of our folks to the sponsorship process.
[time=659] The response of many of our folks to the sponsorship program of the Bible Hour.
[time=664] I want to make everyone very sure that they understand that this sponsorship program is not an abdication on our part of the responsibility for the Bible Hour, but it's a sharing of that responsibility with many people who watch this program every week.
[time=679] That means that there are a number of individuals and families who have agreed to help underwrite certain aspects of the television ministry during these days, especially in the summer.
[time=689] They're doing it in two ways.
[time=690] First of all, those who are sponsors are underwriting the cost of one television program, the airtime for one television program, and others are responding as associate sponsors.
[time=702] That means that they're sending a gift of $100 to help underwrite the cost of one television program that goes out on Sunday.
[time=710] We are on four stations commercially, as you know, and the total cost just for the airtime is exceeding $2,000 a week, so there's a great responsibility that we have to be faithful to the Lord in underwriting this ministry.
[time=725] It's a very costly ministry.
[time=726] And of course, the airtime is just a very small portion of what it costs to produce this program every week.
[time=732] This week, we're happy to share with you that we have four co-sponsors or associate sponsors, and I want to share with you who these folks are.
[time=740] First of all, Catherine Lickty from here in the Fort Wayne area, who watches the program on 21, and Richard Harklas, who is a Founders Club member, who watches the television program on Channel 21, and we're happy to have Mr. and Mrs. John Kaufman, who are sponsoring the program on Channel 46 in South Bend today, and Earl Ulry, Channel 46 in South Bend, and Mrs. Marie Goodrich, Channel 46, South Bend, and she's doing her sponsorship today in memory of her son and husband, Elden Glob and Joseph Glob.
[time=775] We're so grateful for these folks who have become a part of today's television ministry.
[time=780] Mrs. Lickty, Mr. Harklas, Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman, Earl Ulry, and Mrs. Marie Goodrich are helping us preach the gospel today in Fort Wayne and in South Bend.
[time=792] And we're so very grateful to them for their help and their ministry, and they will share in the fruit and reward it comes with whatever happens as a result of today's telecast.
[time=802] Each of these people will receive this week in the mail a special certificate, the associate sponsor certificate, that will help them remember this very special day when they helped us preach the gospel on television.
[time=815] And I want to say a special word of appreciation again to all of these fine people who have helped us in the ministry of the Bible hour today.
[time=822] If you'd be interested in knowing how you could be a part of the sponsorship program, I would encourage you to write to me this week and we'll be happy to send you the information so that you can participate in helping us get the gospel out to the many areas that are yet to hear.
[time=837] Thanks again for all of you who have helped us in this very special way.
[time=842] During these days, our special gift offer is a little booklet that has become a very popular matter, a very popular item with all of our viewers.
[time=849] It's called the answer book.
[time=851] And though my name appears on the front, I really didn't write it, I just helped put it together.
[time=855] Where you see the contents of this book is nothing more or less than the scripture.
[time=861] Just verses selected and put in order along a topic so that you can find the special verses in the Bible that you need when you're doing your research or when you need that verse for a special moment in time.
[time=873] On the inside of the book, the verses are put together categorically.
[time=877] For instance, there's a very wonderful section on spiritual growth, several key verses on the growth of the Christian in his own life.
[time=886] When you open to that page, as it is indicated in the index, you will find the key verses of the Bible that deal with that subject.
[time=892] Across the page is a section of scripture on the subject of temptation.
[time=898] These verses are handily put together in this little booklet so that you don't have to spend a great deal of time searching for them.
[time=905] The book is small enough to slip inside your coat pocket and also to put inside your purse, ladies, so you can carry it with you wherever you go.
[time=913] Some folks are keeping it handy by the telephone so that when folks call and they need a verse to help or a verse to encourage, they have it ready and accessible.
[time=922] We'd like to send you this special gift, the answer book, this week, if you'll write for it and request it, and we'd be happy to mail it to you as soon as we receive your letter.
[time=931] When you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=939] Once again, that address is post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and request the answer book.
[time=947] Of course, that's the address you need to use when you ask for information about the sponsors program as well.
[time=953] We hope to be hearing from you this week.
[time=955] We trust you'll write to us as soon as you have an opportunity.
[time=958] Make sure you have the address correct so that we will get your letter this week.
[time=962] Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=970] Now it's time for us to get back to our morning service, and today I'll be concluding a series of messages on the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=980] I trust you'll stay with us as we open the Word of God together.
[time=983] (gentle music)
[time=1025] (gentle music) - Thank you, Marlene.
[time=1036] That's Marlene Nichols, Dr. Nichols' wife.

[time=1700] Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
[time=1707] Surrender to the will of God.

[time=1757] Surrender to the will of God.
[time=1769] O, let you be, my presence, Savior.
[time=1781] Surrender to the will of God.
[time=1799] Thank you, Don and Janet, let's pray together.
[time=1815] Our Father, we would pray that you would help us to learn what it means to live the words
[time=1821] of that great song.
[time=1824] We hang on to our problems and to our lives, struggle so to let God have them when all
[time=1832] He wants to do is take them and make them better than they are.
[time=1836] We pray that the message that we have heard in music will permeate our hearts and our thoughts as we open again this book which has the message of surrender almost on every
[time=1847] page and the love of God who is willing to take us from where we are to where we need to be, for we pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, Amen.
[time=1858] Our Bibles are open today for the last message from the 17th chapter of the book of John.
[time=1866] We have been studying together the Lord's prayer for His own and today I want to conclude
[time=1872] this series of messages with the understanding that we have by no means exhausted the truth
[time=1878] that is here for us.
[time=1880] We come to the last request of the Savior for His people.
[time=1885] It is a request that has been much misunderstood and maligned and perhaps is at the foundation
[time=1893] of a great wide sweeping movement that is moving across our country which we know as
[time=1900] the one-world church movement or the ecumenical movement and it is a great temptation for
[time=1908] us to bypass this by way of any negative instruction, but we must see that this prayer which has
[time=1915] been offered by the Lord Jesus in behalf of the church is a prayer which the Holy Spirit
[time=1922] intends and is in the process of fulfilling and He needs no help from any worldwide organization.
[time=1929] The prayer is basically mentioned in three places in this chapter.
[time=1934] It is found first of all in the eleventh verse and let us read it there.
[time=1941] And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father.
[time=1947] Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me and here it is that they may be one as we are.
[time=1955] You will find it again in verse 21 of this chapter that they all may be one as thou father
[time=1961] art in me and I envy that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that
[time=1968] thou hast sent me.
[time=1969] And again in verse 23 I am them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one
[time=1976] or better translated perfectly one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me
[time=1982] and has loved them as thou hast loved me.
[time=1986] Now it is interesting first of all to note that there is a progression in the three mentions of oneness in this chapter.
[time=1993] The first mention is that they may be one as we are, verse 11.
[time=1998] But notice in verse 21 it is further expanded to say that they all may be one as thou father
[time=2004] art in me and I envy.
[time=2007] And then it finds the apex of its truth in verse 23 where the Lord Jesus prays that they
[time=2013] may be perfectly one.
[time=2018] When I first came to Fort Wayne one of the first things that I did was to join a local recreational organization so that I could work out on a regular basis and I shall never forget the first time I visited that special place.
[time=2030] When I walked out of the door, up over the doorway of that recreational center were the
[time=2037] words of this prayer that they may be one.
[time=2042] I couldn't help but think that those words were quite misunderstood by many who walked underneath them as a prayer for some sort of oneness or unity among those who belong
[time=2053] to the organization.
[time=2054] It is at least so called Christian organization that some folks might misunderstand that everyone
[time=2061] who came through those doors was in some way united in a oneness in answer to the prayer
[time=2067] that the Lord prayed here in the seventeenth chapter of the book of John.
[time=2071] But if I thought there was misunderstanding about this prayer in relationship to that little slogan which probably was not put there for that purpose.
[time=2079] There is a great deal of misunderstanding among churchmen today about this prayer.
[time=2084] There are those in our world and many within the boundaries of our own country who feel that in order for this prayer to be answered that men in the place of church leadership
[time=2095] must pick up the reins and begin to construct a church unity which will find its fulfillment
[time=2102] in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ here in the seventeenth chapter of John.
[time=2106] And so the world council of churches and the national council of churches have determined that the answer to this prayer will be found as we organize all of our churches into some
[time=2116] sort of oneness and we end up with a super wonderful world church and that is the direction
[time=2122] toward which many churchmen are headed today.
[time=2126] There is only one problem with that procedure.
[time=2129] First of all, the Holy Spirit does not need the help of the world council of churches nor the national council of churches for that dream to be fulfilled.
[time=2137] In fact, before we're done today, I'm sure you will understand that it is not something that is to be fulfilled but men and women, it is being fulfilled right now in our lives,
[time=2147] in our churches, in our hearts.
[time=2148] It is being fulfilled in the truest sense of the word as far as the scripture is concerned.
[time=2154] The second reason why this can never happen according to the modern interpretation is there is just no way that you can organize unity.
[time=2163] The churchmen are telling us that what we do is we get everybody together and someone gives up something here and someone else gives up something over here.
[time=2170] And doctrine isn't important, we just get together and I question when I get done reading all of this literature, what is left when we have taken all the doctrine out of what we believe?
[time=2180] What is the sense of having church if the basis of our unity is not in that which we believe in the creeds of the Word of God?
[time=2188] I remember reading some time ago the words of a great expositor of the Word of God by
[time=2194] the name of Dr. G. Campbell Morgan who spoke to this issue long before it was at the level
[time=2200] that we face today.
[time=2202] Dr. Morgan was speaking out against the attempts in his day to try to bring unity about from
[time=2208] the outside and create uniformity instead of unity.
[time=2212] He wrote these very pertinent words.
[time=2214] He said there is a toleration which is treachery and there is a peace which issues in paralysis.
[time=2223] There are hours when the church must say no to those who should ask communion with her
[time=2229] in the doing of her work upon the basis of compromise.
[time=2233] Such standing aloof may produce ostracism and persecution but it will maintain power
[time=2239] and influence if the church of God in the cities of today were aloof from the maxims of the age separated from the materialistic philosophies of the schools bearing her witness
[time=2251] alone to the all sufficiency of Jesus Christ and the perfection of his salvation even though
[time=2257] persecuted and ostracized and bruised it would be to the church that men would look in the
[time=2263] hour of their heartbreak and sorrow and national need.
[time=2267] The reason said G. Campbell Morgan why men do not look to the church today is that she has destroyed her own influence by compromise.
[time=2277] I believe that's a true statement.
[time=2278] It was true in Morgan's day and it's true in our day.
[time=2281] The church today has lost its influence.
[time=2283] They have given up so much in the name of uniformity.
[time=2287] Some of them supposing that they were fulfilling the wishes and desires of the Savior that we might all be one, that they have lost their influence in our world today.
[time=2295] There's so much world in the church and so much church in the world that there's nothing either one has to say to the other.
[time=2301] Now what did the Lord mean when he prayed that they all might be one?
[time=2306] I think we can understand that first of all from this passage and then from what other passage that we will turn to.
[time=2312] The first illustration of this oneness found in the 11th verse is a very interesting one.
[time=2320] It reminds us that we are united in a very special way with all of the church throughout all ages from time immemorial when the church began.
[time=2328] Verse 11 says, "And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come
[time=2334] to the Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given thee, that
[time=2340] they may be one as we are." What kind of oneness are we talking about?
[time=2345] It is a very spiritual oneness that is likened to the oneness between the Father and the Son.
[time=2351] Its very basis is spiritual.
[time=2354] It is not an organizational oneness, not something that is orchestrated in a conference or convention, nor is it going to be put on paper and passed out as an issue or a bull for someone to sit down and read and then follow.
[time=2367] But this unity is something which is spiritual.
[time=2370] It is the same kind of oneness that the Father and the Son have with each other.
[time=2376] The second thing we notice about this unity in this passage of scripture is that it is a unity of shared truth.
[time=2382] In verse 20, the Lord Jesus switches gears in his prayer to include not just the disciples
[time=2389] but all of those who should believe in his name.
[time=2392] He says, "Neither pray I for these alone, the disciples, but for them also who shall believe on me, through their word." Now, who does that include?
[time=2401] Why men and women?
[time=2402] That includes all of us.
[time=2403] That includes everyone who is a part of the church, not just the apostles, but everyone who has believed on the Lord through the Word which is recorded here in the scripture.
[time=2411] There is a very wonderful sense in which the world church for which the Lord preached
[time=2417] and for which he prayed is a collection of everyone who is a born-again believer from the time of the apostles right on through until today.
[time=2426] Human women, you and I are members of the same church as the apostles.
[time=2431] We share the same unity as the apostles.
[time=2434] Our unity is a unity of shared truth.
[time=2437] The truth that comes to us through the Word of God is written by the apostles and the unity which Jesus prayed for was not an outward uniformity to some ecclesiastical principles
[time=2448] but it was a unity based upon doctrine.
[time=2451] So you see when you say doctrine is important and you start taking doctrine out in the name of unity, you have immediately moved away from the answer to the Lord's prayer.
[time=2461] He is not praying for some outward unity, he is praying for an inward unity that is based upon the Word of God and truth.
[time=2469] Anytime someone says we need to give up our doctrine so that we can be one, you know that person is going in the wrong direction.
[time=2476] Doctrine is not ever to be given up, that is the basis of our unity.
[time=2479] We are never so unified as we are unified around the Word of God.
[time=2485] The third thing in this passage that I want to share with you quickly is that we are unified around the shared power of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2493] Verses 21 and 22 says that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee
[time=2500] that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory
[time=2506] which thou gave us to me I have given them that they may be one as we are.
[time=2512] What is he saying?
[time=2513] He is saying that the same power that was resident in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ as he walked upon this earth as men saw him and recognized the power that was resident
[time=2523] in him, that power, that glory he has passed on to every Christian and that glory is the resident glory and power which is within us and it is that power which is at the central
[time=2534] part of our unity with one another.
[time=2537] It is the dynamism that the church has that draws us together, the power of the Spirit of God living within us.
[time=2544] Verse 23 says we share the same life that the Savior shares with the Father.
[time=2551] Now there is a difference between unity and uniformity.
[time=2555] Unity is that which comes from within.
[time=2559] Uniformity is that which was foisted from without.
[time=2563] We are unified because of the central purposes around which we function as Christians.
[time=2570] Uniformity is that which we force on people so that they will look alike.
[time=2575] For instance in some schools around the country they have determined that they will follow the practice of uniformity and so they tell their children that they must wear certain
[time=2585] kinds of clothes, outfits, what do you call them, uniforms.
[time=2590] Un dressed in blue, a certain type of blue uniform with a white collar etc.
[time=2595] Now there is not anything wrong with that but brothers and sisters if you think that is unity you ought to talk to some of the kids.
[time=2601] That is uniformity.
[time=2603] They have said to those young people do this and they have pushed it on them and they do it because it is required.
[time=2611] But unity is that which grows up within the body.
[time=2615] Our bodies are our unity because there is a coordinating principle within us that causes us to function coordinatingly.
[time=2623] And in the church Jesus prayed that we might be unified and there is no way that can happen by forcing it upon the outside of the organism.
[time=2631] Can only come as we come to grips with those things which are ours in common in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2638] Someone says to us pastor wise in this church a part of the world council of churches why aren't you involved in promoting the ecumenical movement why don't you belong to the national council of churches very simple they don't believe what we believe they believe the blood
[time=2651] atonement is optional the second coming is optional verbal inspiration is optional you can take it or leave it it's not all that important now not everyone in that group believes that but they have joined together with a group of folks who don't really care about the truths of this book they're not as important as the outward structure and I have a clear word from God about that that word is that I am to stand for what this book says and
[time=2676] I should not be concerned about whether or not I'm a part of some great organization for you see the organization which we are a part of which you participate in which we share in as a church is an organization an organism which is far greater and faster than
[time=2693] all of the organizations the world can ever dream of because it goes back to the apostles and it includes every single person who has ever come to faith in Jesus Christ we are
[time=2704] the church of Jesus Christ if we have accepted Christ and it doesn't matter what denomination they may be in what country they may live in what language they may speak the Bible says
[time=2714] for then every one of us all of us have been baptized by one spirit into one body and we
[time=2721] are the church the church at large that church at large has never been in one place at the same time nor will it ever be till we get to heaven the first full fledged absolute perfect
[time=2734] attendance meeting of the world church will take place in heaven because there's no way we can go back and get all the apostles here and all the people from the Reformation everyone else and get them all together and have a have a world church meeting when I hear about world council meetings that are going to get the whole world church together I smile because they can't go back in history and everyone who's accepted Christ is a part of that world church now what is it that we hold in common that that draws us together and makes us a unity it's not the places where we worship we worship in a gym gym notorious some people
[time=2766] worship in cathedrals not the place where we come to worship it certainly isn't the learned
[time=2773] character of the preachers or I would be out of it if that were the case what is it that we have in common that causes us to be unified take your bibles and turn to Ephesians chapter four and let us review very quickly what the Bible says about our unity as Christians there
[time=2792] are seven unity's that are listed here that we share together every single attempt to
[time=2798] bring the church together in unity needs to be tested by these seven things in Ephesians
[time=2805] chapter four we read these words verse four for there is one body one spirit called in
[time=2811] one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all first of all there's one body the word is
[time=2822] soma it is a declaration that all believers from Pentecost until the rapture belong to
[time=2828] the same organism Romans 12 5 says but we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members
[time=2837] one of another first Corinthians 10 17 says for we being many are one bread in one body
[time=2843] we are all partakers of that one bread first Corinthians 12 27 says now you are the body
[time=2850] of Christ and members in particular now we cannot comprehend the wonderful truth that is here but we did not live when Paul lived and we don't understand what he was saying but what he was teaching was that all of those who were born in in the family of God
[time=2865] out of the Jewish community and all of those out of the Gentile community had been brought together in one special unique organism called the body of Christ the middle wall had been
[time=2875] broken down and the fences had been moved out to include everyone who was a Christian and there was one new body the body of Christ made up of every single person who believes
[time=2886] that's the first unity secondly Paul writes to the Ephesians that we have one spirit what
[time=2892] is it that energizes this body well it is the spirit of God who lives within each individual
[time=2898] believer and in dwells and inhabits the church the body of Christ throughout the scripture
[time=2905] over and over again we're told about the priority of the spirit in the unity of the believer in the book of Romans in the book of first Corinthians we're told that without the spirit of God there is no life without the spirit of God there is no salvation without the spirit of God there is no unity just as our human body the bodies in which we live is one because
[time=2926] it is pervaded by one soul so the body of Christ is one because it is pervaded by one
[time=2932] in the same spirit who dwells in all and is the common principle that we have as Christians
[time=2939] when I go to New Hampshire or to Texas or to Florida or to California I meet fellow believers
[time=2945] and we are one together what causes that well the same spirit of God who lives within me lives within them and as soon as we recognize that that unity is apparent that we belong
[time=2955] to the same family that we are brothers and sisters in Christ because of the spirit who dwells within us there is one body and one spirit and then a thirdly there is one hope of our calling now the liberals and the ecumenists and the church council people tell us that
[time=2973] prophecy ought not to get involved in our unity they tell us we are not to worry about prophecy whether you're post pre or mid whatever you might be that's immaterial because prophecy is not an important doctrinal issue and yet in this passage of scripture which sets forth the unity of the body it is interesting that the hope of our calling is one of those unity
[time=2993] the Bible says that this hope is laid up for us in heaven that we have a hope around which
[time=3001] we are unified now I'm not going to argue with some of you that think that the Lord's coming after the tribulation you're going to learn about that later and I'll just wait for the Lord to take time to teach you that and do process but the fact that we are unified around the coming of Christ draws us together it's one of those unities that we have if you ask me to sit down and have fellowship and to work together and to coordinate an effort with a man who says he doesn't believe in the second coming of Christ I don't have anything in common with him how can I work with him how can I be unified with him how can we strive
[time=3034] for the same goals we're going in a different direction one of the unities of the body men and women for which we ought to be grateful is the unity that we share in the hope of our calling the coming of Christ the events of prophecy notice it's not only one hope but
[time=3051] it's also one Lord this one Lord has to do with the lordship of Christ over his church
[time=3057] over all believers his sovereign control over us we are he is because he bought us and we
[time=3063] owe our allegiance as the church to one Lord we worship the Lord Jesus Christ and he is
[time=3069] the object of our focus and attention we do not worship him as the superstar we superstar
[time=3077] superstar I wonder who you are I think of that sometimes when I think of that phrase it's not the Lord Jesus we don't worship him as some example we worship him as the Lord deity
[time=3088] and the deity of Christ is one of the cardinal truths around which we bring our unity and
[time=3094] our oneness together one baptism the baptism is the outward declaration that we are bound
[time=3100] together with the bonds of the covenant united to the same God and to each other and then
[time=3106] last of all one God and father of all overall through all in all the church men and women
[time=3112] is one it is pervaded by one spirit we give allegiance to one Lord we are committed to
[time=3119] one creed one faith according to this text and the word faith here is a word which represents
[time=3125] all of the teaching of this book the word of God we bring our unity together by our baptism
[time=3132] our outward declaration of faith and we look forward to one hope the hope and coming of Christ and that is the basis of our oneness now I'm one with anyone who believes that
[time=3143] I don't care what tag they have on them does it make any difference to me whether they're
[time=3149] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Catholic whatever they are if they believe the book and the unity's that are here described then we are one if they're in Christ but don't ask us to be one with someone doesn't believe that because that's impossible that isn't possible to have unity without the commonality of oneness in the things which this book teaches when the
[time=3169] Lord Jesus prayed that we might be one he was praying that all believers everywhere who
[time=3175] believe the book and give adherence to it that they would be one with each other and
[time=3181] that they would have that one commonality that should be theirs because of their allegiance
[time=3187] to Christ now the sad fact of it is there are many in our generation who not only separate from those who are not part of the body they have found convenient ways to separate from those who are in the body and that's where the Lord says without not to do he says that's where the line we ought to be one in fellowship with those who believe this book and belong
[time=3206] to the body of Christ we may not agree about all the minor points but the minor points are not the things we've talked about these are the major points and we ought to agree on these points if we're to be one that we might be answering the request of the Savior
[time=3221] now at the end of the 17th chapter he gives to us the clue as to how this is to be done the very last verse of the chapter he reminds us that the overwhelming pervading attitude
[time=3235] that is to be ours is an attitude of love and graciousness verse 26 of the 17th chapter
[time=3242] the very last word from Christ in his prayers this and I have declared unto them by name
[time=3249] and will declare it that the love which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them
[time=3256] I wish the brethren who get up on their high horses and blast away at the doctrine of separation
[time=3264] as important as it is would read the last part of the chapter I ought not to find any great joy in saying to a brother we are not in the same family I ought to do that in love
[time=3275] in the spirit of love love ought to pervade my heart what kind of love why the same kind of love with which I have been loved the same kind of love the Savior says with which he was loved by the Father the atmosphere of the family ought to be the atmosphere of love
[time=3290] not only as we minister to one another within the body but as we reach out to those without the body it's a sad and lacking feature in many Christians today who believe what we believe
[time=3304] you see the Bible always has it in perspective we can stand straight and take our stand for the word of God and the real unity of the family but we can do it in a spirit of love
[time=3314] for those who do not know Christ and those who do not believe what we believe I read recently a story of a little boy who was a part of a who was a part of a special program
[time=3327] at his school he was a deformed little boy young lad with a a hunchback a deformed back
[time=3335] he was supposed to recite in the play and he walked out on the stage and began to recite
[time=3342] and one of the neighborhood boys who slipped into the congregation hollered right out in the convocation hey crip hey crip you forgot to take the pack off your back a little boy
[time=3356] was so unnerved so shocked by such a cruel statement that he broke down and begin to cry right in the middle of his recitation up from the audience ran an older man picked
[time=3368] the little boy up in his arms and he said I find it hard to believe anyone could ever say something so cruel I want to tell you something this little boy is mine and I love
[time=3380] him and when I read that I thought that's exactly what Jesus Christ has done for all of us that's why we have no attitude of bigotry no attitude of being better than anyone else
[time=3391] how do we get in the family one day the Lord Jesus reached down with all of our hunchback sins and crippled life and our rebellion against him and he bought us and he took us in his
[time=3403] arms and and when we fall down and falter and we give evidence to the fact that we don't
[time=3409] really have any right to belong to the family of God in his loving arms he picks us up and he says don't criticize this person he's mine I bought him he belongs to my family and I
[time=3420] love him and I'll not take the criticism of anyone against one of my children we're in
