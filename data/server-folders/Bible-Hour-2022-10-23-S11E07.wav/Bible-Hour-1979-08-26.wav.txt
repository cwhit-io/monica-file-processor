[time=0] (beeping) [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=43] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=50] And it's this opportunity that we take to welcome you to this service,
[time=57] taking place in the auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=60] Our guests today are the new disciples from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=67] They will be ministering to us throughout this service.
[time=69] I know that they'll be a great blessing to us as we share their music.
[time=74] As always, we began our service with the ministry of our own choir.
[time=78] And they have been singing for us recently songs from an album that was recorded in Alexandria,
[time=84] songs which were written by Bill and Gloria Gaither, and which extol the greatness and honor of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=93] They're singing for us now a song entitled, "I Will Praise Him." (music)
[time=114] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=300] >> Thank you, Choir.
[time=319] As we mentioned before, our guests today are the new disciples from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=327] And they have already blessed us with their ministry of music.
[time=332] They're great young people who love the Lord Jesus Christ, and they love music.
[time=336] And you can tell when you listen to them sing that it's more than just a performance, it's a testimony of their heart.
[time=343] We're so grateful that it has been possible for them to share this day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=349] And we'd like for you to listen to them now as they sing for us the song, It is Well, With My Soul.
[time=354] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=614] We do appreciate so much, you're joining with us today on the Bible Hour, we thank you for being with us each week as we share this television program with our many wonderful friends at home.
[time=627] We appreciate the opportunity of preaching the Word of God and singing and talking together about things which we know are very important in your life as you grow together with us in the things of the Lord.
[time=639] During these past few days we've been having the opportunity of sharing in a sponsorship program which has involved a great number of people in this outreach ministry.
[time=649] And today we want to introduce to you another sponsor that God has brought our way to help us in sending the Gospel out via television.
[time=658] Our sponsor for today's program is Donna G. Lewis and she is sponsoring the Bible Hour today in honor of Lucy Marie Lewis and we're so thankful for Donna for her willingness to support the Bible Hour that the message of Jesus Christ might go out all over this area.
[time=677] Donna, she is sponsoring the Bible Hour here in the Channel 21 area and that's a very exciting thing to us because we are the strongest outreach in all of the Bible Hour.
[time=687] Here in this local area and many, many friends watch this program each Sunday as it comes to them live locally on Channel 21.
[time=696] So my appreciation also goes out to Donna Lewis for her help and we want to take this moment to express to you that if you would be interested in helping with us helping us as we reach out through the sponsorship program we'd be very happy to hear from you.
[time=710] And just a moment we'll give you the address that you need to have so that you can write to us and get information about the sponsorship program.
[time=719] Before we share with you our special gift offer for today let me remind you again that along with the full sponsorship program there is this associate sponsors program which involves a contribution of $100 toward the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=734] Your gift of $100 allows you to become an associate sponsor and when you do that we will send you this beautiful certificate that will help you to remember that on a particular Sunday you helped preach the gospel to thousands of people through the Bible Hour television ministry.
[time=750] If you'd be interested in knowing more about the sponsorship program please write to us this week and we'll be happy to send you the details.
[time=757] During these last few weeks we've been introducing to our Bible Hour Friends a very special Bible study tool called the Answer Book. Donna what's the Answer Book?
[time=767] The Answer Book is a compilation of scripture verses that deal with different problems and situations that you face in your everyday life.
[time=777] If you are perhaps at this time experiencing grief or sorrow in your life because of the loss of a loved one you can pick up this little book and turn to that topic and it has the scriptures actually written out for you.
[time=791] It has God's answer to your need. Donna I think the thing that's so exciting about this is I've written in the introduction.
[time=798] It's not an answer it is the answer. Today so many people are looking for answers and sometimes they look for them among fellow seekers.
[time=807] They don't find any answers because all they find there are the questions.
[time=811] What we have recorded here in this booklet the answers from the Word of God and they are simply the reproduction of scripture verses which are right to the point in terms of individual pertinent needs in the lives of people.
[time=824] As you open this book and leaf through its pages you will find the very key verses from all of the scripture organized for you in topical fashion so that as you turn to the subject of your interest you will find the key verses written out.
[time=838] The verses are interchangeably written so that you can pick them out clearly one verse in light type the next verse in dark and bold type so that as you look down through the pages you will find all of the key verses that meet your need.
[time=853] This is a very handy little book isn't it?
[time=856] Yes it's just the right size so you can put it in the front of your bible you can leave it lying by the phone in case you happen to do any counseling over the telephone.
[time=866] It's just a real handy booklet to have and we would like to send you your free copy and all you have to do is write to us and we will put one in the mail to you at absolutely no cost to you.
[time=877] Don I need to remind our friends that when they write it's very important first of all that they identify the station on which they view this program and when you write you should write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815.
[time=894] Once again the address that you should use when you write is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815.
[time=906] We'll be happy to put your free copy of the answer book in the mail today as our way of encouraging you to use the word of God to meet the needs in your own life.
[time=916] We trust it will be a blessing to you and God will enable you to use it to reach out and bless the lives of many others.
[time=922] Thank you so much for being a part of our program today.
[time=925] I trust that you'll stay with us as we go back to our service in just a few moments.
[time=929] I'm going to be looking into the Old Testament to share with you a very exciting story from the life of Moses.
[time=935] And I think you'll be excited to learn what God has for us today on this edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=952] [MUSIC]
[time=972] And thank you for the good singing.
[time=974] The Lord in the Word of God tells us that we are going to see him once again face to face.
[time=980] The Lord himself, the Bible says, shall descend from heaven with a shout.
[time=986] The new disciples from Woody Bible Institute come now and they're going to sing a song that says,
[time=992] "Someday my Lord will come." [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1201] Thank you new disciples. In just a moment they're going to sing again.
[time=1205] And when they sing they're going to continue the theme of the Lord's return and our opportunity to be with him soon.
[time=1213] While we're waiting for them to sing, I want to share with you that in just a few weeks, in fact on the 16th of September,
[time=1220] we will begin our double service program here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1225] That means that on Sunday morning there will be two morning services and two Sunday schools running simultaneously.
[time=1232] There will be a morning service at 9.40 and a morning service at 10.50.
[time=1237] There will be a Sunday school at 9.40 and a Sunday school at 10.50.
[time=1241] And you should be receiving those of you here locally who receive this week newspaper a schedule of how those services will be running.
[time=1249] We just want to encourage all of you to avail yourself of this opportunity.
[time=1254] It's a strategy on our part to make possible growth in our morning services during these days,
[time=1260] even in the summertime, quite often our auditorium has been completely filled.
[time=1265] And we're grateful to the Lord for making it possible for us to expand our outreach by making more room available for people to come
[time=1274] and share in the ministry of music and in the ministry of the Word of God.
[time=1278] Please mark that date on your calendar and make sure that you are a part of what's going on here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1285] Now just before the message, let's listen again to the new disciples as they sing the song "The Sweet, By and By."
[time=1315] So, where the way to prepare us are dwelling place there.
[time=1329] In the sweet, the sweet, by and by.
[time=1339] We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[time=1347] In the sweet, by and by.
[time=1358] We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[time=1372] The melodia songs of the blessed.
[time=1378] And our spirit shall sorrow no more.
[time=1386] Not aside for the blessing of rest.
[time=1395] In the sweet, the by and by.
[time=1403] We shall meet on that beautiful, beautiful shore.
[time=1411] In the sweet, by and by.
[time=1422] We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
[time=1430] There's a land that is better than the day.
[time=1443] Thank you new disciples. Have you enjoyed their ministry?
[time=1451] I will do everything possible to get them back.
[time=1472] They have been a blessing.
[time=1475] Our message is from the Old Testament and the Book of Exodus, the 17th chapter.
[time=1481] Exodus chapter 17.
[time=1485] In this record from the 17th chapter of the Book of Exodus, we examine an episode out of the life of Moses.
[time=1495] It is an episode which must be considered in its context.
[time=1500] For it has some tremendous messages to teach us.
[time=1506] I hope you will join me with your Bibles open as I read from mine the 17th chapter of the Book of Exodus,
[time=1513] beginning at the first verse and we shall read through verse 7.
[time=1517] Exodus chapter 17 verses 1 through 7.
[time=1521] And all the congregation of the children of Israel, all the people journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the Lord,
[time=1530] and encamped in refedim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
[time=1535] Wherefore the people did strive with Moses and said, give us water that we may drink.
[time=1540] Moses said unto them, why strive you with me?
[time=1543] Wherefore you put the Lord to test.
[time=1546] The people thirsted there for water.
[time=1549] The people murmured against Moses and said, why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to kill us, and our children and our cattle with thirst?
[time=1557] And Moses cried unto the Lord saying, what shall I do unto this people?
[time=1562] They are almost ready to stone me.
[time=1565] The Lord said unto Moses, go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of Israel and thy rod, wherewith thou smoteest the river, take an eye hand and go.
[time=1574] Behold, I will stand before thee, there upon the rock in horrib.
[time=1578] Thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.
[time=1583] And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel, and he called the name of the place Massa and Meribah because of the striving of the children of Israel,
[time=1593] and because they tested the Lord saying, is the Lord among us or not?
[time=1599] Shall we pray?
[time=1600] Father, we thank thee for the chronicles of the Old Testament, the historical narrative that help us to understand the experiences of thy chosen people.
[time=1612] We thank thee for the lessons of leadership that are taught to us through the life of Moses,
[time=1618] the revered leader of the people of Israel, the meek man, the man whom thou did's choose to be the giver of law and the leader of thy people
[time=1630] during the very crucial days of their sojourn in the wilderness.
[time=1635] We pray our Father that you will help us to understand the lessons of leadership that are taught us in this passage.
[time=1641] May we all learn what you would have for us in this experience as we study it together.
[time=1648] May the Spirit of God have freedom in our service.
[time=1651] May he be able to speak to each of our hearts at the point of our need that we might be challenged and encouraged and inspired to do better for thee.
[time=1662] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1668] There's a world of truth in the little words of the Bible.
[time=1673] In the context where we find this record, which I have read for you tonight, there is a little word which is usually passed over.
[time=1682] It is the word and.
[time=1685] Usually we don't pay much attention to it.
[time=1688] It is just the glue that puts passages together and we pass over it so very quickly.
[time=1694] But if you will go back with me to the 15th chapter of the Book of Exodus and mark out some significant ends in the context, you will see why it is important for us to see this story, which we have just read in light of the wider context of the experiences of Moses with the people of Israel.
[time=1712] In Exodus chapter 15 we read that Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea after their great victory.
[time=1719] And we read in verse 23 and they came to Mara.
[time=1724] Notice the word and. It is just as if it were an incidental thing.
[time=1729] They came to the waters of Mara and there they experienced the bitterness of the water sweetened only as the tree was applied to the water according to the commandment of the Lord.
[time=1740] If you trace on down in your text you will discover in verse 27 that we read and they came to Elam as if by again an incidental reporting of the facts.
[time=1752] Elam was the place where God provided 12 wells of water and 70 palm trees to bring shade and encouragement to the people of Israel.
[time=1762] We come now to the 16th chapter and we read again and they took their journey from Elam.
[time=1769] And all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of scene and the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. We come now to the 17th chapter of the book of Exodus
[time=1784] and again we see that little word and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness. After their journey according to the commandment of the Lord
[time=1795] and in camped in refugees.
[time=1799] These experiences taken together remind us that the path of faith is a path of trial.
[time=1807] The word and connects the experience of Mara to the experience of Elam
[time=1813] to the experience of the manner that God provided and ultimately to the experience that we are going to study in today's lesson the experience of God's provision of water.
[time=1825] It is interesting to follow the pathway of the people of Israel and to note that the path which they were on was a path of faith.
[time=1833] God had commanded every step of the way and yet it was not a pathway that was free from trial
[time=1839] almost on every side and at every turn there were difficulties to be encountered.
[time=1845] And if that was true for the people of Israel it was certainly true for their leader Moses.
[time=1850] The man God chose to lead two and a half million Israelites through the difficult experiences
[time=1856] which we have read and mentioned in the reading of the Word of God.
[time=1861] For if the path of the Israelites was a path of faith and a path of trial then Israel's leader ultimately was also called upon to face difficulties in his leadership.
[time=1876] It is interesting that every one of these places has a name and that name has become significant
[time=1882] for the particular experience that was undergone by the people.
[time=1886] Mara was bitterness, Elam was pleasantness, manna was provision.
[time=1893] And now according to the text we have just read, Maribah is a place where testing took place.
[time=1901] Here God, it was to teach Moses three very important lessons.
[time=1908] They were lessons that God needed to teach him because of where he was in his own life and in his own leadership.
[time=1915] They were lessons that almost every leader has to learn somewhere along the way.
[time=1920] Three very significant, very simple lessons, but three lessons that some people never learn and because of that are not able to be used to the fullest extent by God in heaven.
[time=1932] As we share these lessons from the Word of God, let us not put them in chronological sequence
[time=1938] just to understand the life of Moses, but let us look into our own hearts and examine ourselves to see whether or not these lessons are lessons God might be teaching us
[time=1950] in the particular experiences of our lives.
[time=1953] The first lesson that God would teach Moses at Refodym was the lesson of the powerlessness of man.
[time=1962] The lesson of the powerlessness of man.
[time=1966] Not many of God's servants seem to be able to handle success.
[time=1972] Most all of them can somehow exist in the valley of humiliation, but when success comes their way,
[time=1979] they discover that the opportunities for being tripped up are on every hand.
[time=1985] It does seem that it's much easier to know how to be abased than to how to be abounding.
[time=1991] It seems like it's much easier to be empty than it is to be full.
[time=1996] And for everyone who failed during the times of difficulty, there seemed to be ten who failed during the times of success.
[time=2006] Somehow God's servants seemed to pick up the spirit of Nebuchadnezzar when he was at the height of his rule
[time=2014] and said, "Is not this great Babylon which I have built by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty."
[time=2024] Sometimes when God uses a man, if he is not careful, he can make the unfortunate transfer that what God has done for him, he has done for himself.
[time=2036] Such was the case in Moses' life.
[time=2040] When this happens to a man, God cannot use him anymore until he purges him of that attitude, until he deals with him.
[time=2049] And sometimes his dealings can be very difficult indeed.
[time=2054] The Bible reminds us that there is no flesh that can glory in the presence of God.
[time=2060] In the book of Isaiah, chapter 10 and verse 15, we read these words, "Shall the ax boast itself against him that hueth therewith? Shall the saw magnify itself against him that hueth therewith?
[time=2075] Shall the rod shake itself against them that lifted up?
[time=2081] In other words, will the thing that is being controlled by the master shake its fist in the face of the master and say, "I will do it this way?"
[time=2093] Well, it seems as if that happens quite often when God lifts up a man and begins to use him.
[time=2099] There are so many who serve God until they are strong, and then they are lifted up with pride and fall.
[time=2107] What happens to men oftentimes happens to churches?
[time=2111] All of us know of churches here and there, in this place or in that, that God used in the wonderful way during a certain time in their history.
[time=2120] Dr. F. B. Meyer has written that if such would only consider and search their hearts,
[time=2126] they would find that they had commenced to trust in the momentum of past successes and to think that somehow the drought of fishes was due to their own fisher experience
[time=2137] instead of being the direct gift of one who often traverses all the rules of art by divine knowledge and power.
[time=2145] As you stop and consider the career of Moses, you cannot help but see how he was in a primary spot to be tested and perhaps to fall.
[time=2155] His whole career in recent years had won one uninterrupted series of successes.
[time=2163] He had been used of God to humble the proudest monarch of his time.
[time=2169] He had led the greatest exodus that has ever taken place in history.
[time=2174] He had stretched forth his hand and parted the ocean and stretched it forth again and drowned all the enemy.
[time=2183] He had composed a song of victory that has lasted since it was written.
[time=2191] He had announced the fall of the manna. He had been an astounding success.
[time=2201] Some wonder if perhaps Moses was not concerned about himself when he penned the words of warning that are called forth to our attention from the 8th chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, verses 11 through 17, the words go like this.
[time=2215] Beware that thou forget not the Lord God, lest when all that thou hast multiplied, thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God and thou say in thine heart, my power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
[time=2233] I cannot help but believe that it was for this particular reason that Paul gloried in the infirmity that God gave him.
[time=2240] For Paul recognized that that infirmity reminded him that he was in the flesh and that is why he was able to say in a most confusing way to many of us that when he was weak he was strong.
[time=2252] For when he understood the infirmity which God had given him he recognized his dependence upon the Lord and he did not glory in his own strength.
[time=2261] So at the pinnacle of success we find Moses face-to-face with an infuriated mob.
[time=2269] Here he was in the desert of refuge, a place that the scholars cannot even finally and completely locate in the maps of the geography of that time.
[time=2281] But it was someplace on the edge of the desert where there was no water and where there was no supply.
[time=2287] And we have read the record that Moses was there, challenged by the people of Israel and they were infuriated.
[time=2294] In fact the Scripture says they were so mad at Moses that they were ready to stone him.
[time=2300] And I cannot help but listen to the cry of Moses when he recognized what kind of fix he was in.
[time=2308] He said, "Lord, what shall I do?" Now you see that's exactly where God wanted him to be before he got in that fix and that's the cry that should be on the lips of every leader at every place along the way.
[time=2321] "Lord, what shall I do?" But unfortunately God has to put some of us in dire straits before we come to the place of lifting up our voice and asking that question that is the dependent question, "Lord, what shall I do?"
[time=2337] Moses was at the end of himself. He didn't know what to do.
[time=2343] There was no way humanly that he could find water for two and a half million people.
[time=2348] In fact when they chided with him he got angry. He said, "Who do you think I am? I can't just create a well."
[time=2354] They had watched Moses in God's hand be the instrument of salvation so many times that even the people forgot that it was God who did the miracles instead of Moses.
[time=2364] And when they didn't get what they wanted they went after the leader instead of the God.
[time=2370] And Moses was confused. He didn't know what to do. He'd been successful all along the way but now he had his back to the wall.
[time=2377] The people were angry. If God didn't come through, if something didn't happen he probably would lose his life and then here would all these people be out in the wilderness, leaderless, waterless.
[time=2388] And certainly they would die. Moses was learning the lesson that all of us have to learn at one time or another in our lives.
[time=2396] A lesson that is described in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5 where we are reminded that we are not sufficient of ourselves.
[time=2406] To think anything is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God.
[time=2412] In this experience of Moses when he is at a loss to know what to do, we are brought again to the truth that most of us are like the men of our time and the men of Moses' time.
[time=2427] We would rather learn to lean on a cobweb of human resources than to trust in the strong arm of God.
[time=2436] When I say that you dare not have a shocked expression on your face for all of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2443] God seems always to be the last resort in our lives. We try everything else until finally we discover that all the time he was waiting with his strong, omnipotent arm all the time he was ready to be our resource but we try everything else instead.
[time=2461] Moses was a self-sufficient dynamic, self-directed, aggressive leader and God continually had to remind him that his sufficiency was not to be found in him.
[time=2474] It is a good reminder for all of us as we stand at this particular place in the life of our church and in our own pilgrimage as Christians.
[time=2483] A reminder that none of us can make a revival, that we cannot save a soul, that we cannot of our own strength bring conviction to one individual, that we are powerless to comfort one soul, that we cannot even counsel anyone meaningfully unless we depend upon the arm of strength instead of the arm of the flesh.
[time=2509] But I have news for you, there's an exciting lesson here because you see, God likes to bring us to the end of ourselves because when we come to the end of ourselves we have come at last to the beginning of God.
[time=2521] When Moses came to the end of himself, it was then that he cried out, "Lord, what shall I do?"
[time=2530] Oh, how God has to rivet that into our hearts, over and over again, we learn it and we think we've got it learned and then we go back to our old way and God has to give us a refresher course.
[time=2542] Could I ask you in this service, how many of you have ever had a course like the Course at Refidim that God gave to Moses, could I see your hand?
[time=2551] Well, there's a few honest people and the rest of you not sure what I'm talking about, so that's all right.
[time=2558] It is a wonderful thing to recognize in this passage of Scripture a very interesting fact in the first verse, and I want you to underline it in your thinking.
[time=2568] We read that the children of Israel came from the wilderness of scene after their journeys.
[time=2575] Now notice the next phrase, "According to the commandment of the Lord."
[time=2582] Now just stop for a moment and remember, God knew there wasn't any water out there and he sent those people on that journey to the place where there was no resource and he did it purposefully because it was a planned lesson and experience for his people.
[time=2599] He did it because he wanted to teach Moses and the people of Israel the sufficiency of God.
[time=2605] The first lesson that Moses learned at Refidim was this, he learned the powerlessness of man.
[time=2612] The second lesson follows hard upon the first and it is always in this sequence that they come.
[time=2619] He learned at Refidim the provision of God.
[time=2623] It is only after we have learned of our own powerlessness that God's provision comes into view.
[time=2629] As long as we are trying to do it ourselves, we will never look beyond our own resources to God's provision for us.
[time=2637] You see that over and over again in the stories of the Bible, in the New Testament, in the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=2643] You remember that the Lord said to his disciples, "How many loaves have you?" Now whether you know it or not, the Lord didn't need that information.
[time=2652] He already knew the answer, but he asked the question so that they would be caused to recognize their own inability to meet the need of those starving people.
[time=2661] "How many loaves have you?" and they said, "We don't have enough." And the Lord said, "Good, you're just in the place where I can do something in your behalf." And he did a miracle for them.
[time=2670] Now he's got Moses in the same place.
[time=2672] "Lord, what shall we do?" And so the Lord began to work out his provision in their behalf.
[time=2679] I want you to notice three things about the provision of the Lord.
[time=2683] First of all, very quickly, his patience.
[time=2687] The patience and long suffering of God is nowhere better demonstrated in the life history of the people of Israel.
[time=2694] Sometimes when you get an opportunity, read the 78th Psalm clear through and you will discover how patient the Lord was with these bitter, murmuring, complaining Jews.
[time=2705] Over and over again, they tested him and tempted him and he continued to be merciful and long suffering.
[time=2712] In this text which we have read, there is no record of God chiding with the people of Israel for their complaint against his leader.
[time=2721] God did not even scold them.
[time=2723] The Scripture simply records that he met their need.
[time=2728] Now mark how patient the Lord was, for in the Scripture it says in verse 7 that the people of Israel were questioning whether or not the Lord was among them.
[time=2740] Notice it says in verse 7, "Is the Lord among us?" They were debating whether there even was a God.
[time=2748] And the only way you can see this in context people is to remember that while they were debating the presence of the Lord, there was a cloud over them,
[time=2756] which was visibly portraying God's presence in their lives.
[time=2760] And laying all around on the ground every morning was the manner that God had miraculously dropped down to meet their needs.
[time=2767] And in the midst of his provision they were saying, "Is the Lord among us? Is God really alive?"
[time=2774] God, every right to rain down fire and judgment upon him what the Scripture says, he just met their need.
[time=2781] Aren't you glad for the patience of the Lord, that he just lovingly and tenderly leads us along even though we over and over again failing?
[time=2790] Some of you have said to me, "Pastor, I'm almost embarrassed sometimes to go back to the Lord with the problem that I've been working on for three years, and I say, "Lord, here I am again."
[time=2799] And he puts his loving arms around me and he just encourages me.
[time=2802] That's not any indication that we should be trite about our sin, but it does indicate that we have a patient God.
[time=2809] I want you to notice, secondly, that not only was his provision seen in his patience, but his provision was seen in his presence.
[time=2818] The Lord said to Moses, "Moses, you just go before the people with your rod."
[time=2826] And notice verse 6, "Behold, I will stand before you upon the rock in horrib, and thou shalt smite the rock."
[time=2834] Now, remember, Moses was mostly concerned, not about the thirst of the people, but about the fact that in their eyes he saw that he was about to be the object of target practice with the stones that were there around the ground.
[time=2848] "Lord," he said, "they're going to stone me, and the Lord said, "Moses, don't you fear? I'm going to stand with you.
[time=2853] My presence will be with you. I'll stand up on the rock with you."
[time=2859] That's another indication of what God is willing to do for us in the midst of the difficulties we face.
[time=2866] The people had threatened to stone Moses, but God said, "Fear not, Moses, I'll be with you. I'll stand with you."
[time=2873] There was a time in the life of Paul when he feared for his life.
[time=2876] It's recorded in the 18th chapter of the book of Acts in verse 10.
[time=2880] "And the Lord said to Paul, 'Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee, for I have many people in this city.'"
[time=2897] It's an interesting thing that when you're in the presence of the Lord, and in the perfect center of his will, his presence is the only information that's important.
[time=2906] But thirdly, I want you to notice not only did God provide his presence, but he also provided his power.
[time=2915] The Scripture says that God decided that he would use a rock as a source of provision for the needs of the people.
[time=2923] I'd never heard of water coming from a rock, nor had the people of Israel, nor had Moses.
[time=2929] Isn't it interesting that God is not limited to the conventional means which limit man?
[time=2936] He gets his job done in the most unique and exciting ways.
[time=2942] When we try to do it ourselves, we limit ourselves to what we can accomplish, but when we put ourselves in the hands of God, it opens up the universe to us and God can choose any means he wants to accomplish his task.
[time=2955] And the Bible is filled with his unique provisions for man. He used the ravens to bring food.
[time=2964] He used the Prime Minister of Egypt to take care of a hunger problem.
[time=2969] He used the Jordan one time to heal a leper.
[time=2975] One time he used wood to make iron swim.
[time=2979] God's power is uniquely displayed when we depend on him.
[time=2984] And what a tremendous thing it is for us to open up our vision to let God get involved so that we can see him do it in his way.
[time=2991] We're always doing it our way and we've got it all charted out how it's going to happen.
[time=2996] When if we would trust God, he could do it his way and it would be so much more exciting because he's not limited to the means which are ours.
[time=3006] I think that must be something of what Paul meant when he wrote to the Corinthians and he said I have not seen nor ear heard the things which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[time=3020] God wants to do for us what we can't do for ourselves and if we'll get out of our own self-resource and into his resource, then his power can be displayed.
[time=3030] When Moses was at Refidim, he learned first of all of his own powerlessness and in the midst of that lesson God demonstrated his provision.
[time=3040] Now thirdly in the same chapter there is one final lesson that God was to teach Moses at the place we call Refidim.
[time=3047] And that final lesson was the lesson of the potential of prayer.
[time=3053] We did not read in our scripture reading the last part of this text, but I can simply tell you that it is one of the first conflicts that the people of Israel were to face on their way to the land of Canaan.
[time=3064] The people of Amalek had formed a confederation and according to the historian Josephus, the tribe of Amalek had gathered forces with all of the desert people from Petra to the Mediterranean.
[time=3080] And Josephus records that they smote the hindmost part of the Israelites, even all that were feeble among them when they were faint and weary.
[time=3089] In other words, as the people of Israel moved on their journey, the people of Amalek attacked them, attacked at the rear of the march and all those who were lagging, they began to attack them and to kill the ones who were weary and feeble.
[time=3103] At this particular time in the life of Moses he was 81 years old. He had been at the forefront of the battle and it was a very prominent thing to see him leading his people, but now there's a transition that's about to take place.
[time=3116] Joshua, his successor, is commanded to go and stand at the front of the people of Israel and to lead them.
[time=3123] And the record tells us that Moses went up upon a high mountain and he stood over the place of battle and the scripture says that when Moses lifted up his hands, the people of Israel prevailed and when his hands went down, the people of Amalek prevailed.
[time=3139] It is a beautiful story, a beautiful picture, a type, if you would, of the power of prayer. For it was the Old Testament way of praying to lift up the hands and it is a picture of what happens when a man of God stops fighting all of the battles on the field below and begins to understand that the battle can be wrought through the means of prayer.
[time=3160] Moses upon the mountain prevailing in behalf of his people and the story that is told in the last part of this chapter is that he got tired. He could no longer hold his hands up and so Aaron and Er came and got beside him and when Moses got tired they propped up his hands so that he would be in the position of victory.
[time=3181] The scripture says that Moses sat down upon a rock and all throughout the day, his hands were lifted up in prevailing prayer for his people. And at refedim, God taught Moses the power of prayer.
[time=3197] In an earlier day Moses would never have done that. He would have figured out some way to do it through the energy of the flesh.
[time=3209] But God taught him there was power in prayer. I believe that Paul went through a similar experience in his own life. He was an aggressive, excited young man who always was out where the action was and then God put him in prison.
[time=3226] And it was while he was in prison that he wrote many of the epistles in the New Testament. And you know what's in the epistles over and over again? I thank God for you making mention always of you in my prayer. Paul prayed.
[time=3240] He knew he couldn't be at the battlefront so he began to use a power that was greater than that and he began to pray that God would do for the people in Philippi and the people in Corinth and the people at Ephesus that God would do for them in a mighty way.
[time=3255] Above and beyond what he could do if he were present with them.
[time=3260] This was a mighty important day in the life and leadership of Moses for at refedim God taught him his own powerlessness. At refedim God taught him for the 20th or 30th time that provision was to be found in the person of the Godhead.
[time=3279] And at refedim God taught him the power of prayer.
[time=3284] It is for that reason as we come to the end of the chapter that we read that Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi verse 15 which being translated is the Lord is my banner.
[time=3303] Before that time Moses might have rightly said Moses is my banner but when God finished the lessons at refedim he pulled his own self banner down and he pulled up upon the flagpole of his life.
[time=3318] The Lord is my banner and from that point on there was a different quality in that man as he led the people of God under the banner of the Lord.
[time=3329] Let me ask you something today is the Lord your banner.
[time=3333] Are you waving your own flag in the self indulgence and in your own flesh or are you marching under the banner of the Lord as he marches forth victoriously in your behalf.
[time=3347] There is a refedim in every life someplace somewhere cooperate with God as he teaches you the lessons that are there.
[time=3359] Let's pray together.
[time=3364] Our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed. You cannot be under the banner of the Lord unless first of all you know him as your personal Savior and I would ask you if you have not put your trust in him personally.
[time=3378] Invited him into your life and accepted him as your Savior that right now at the close of this service while you have the opportunity you will come to him by prayer through faith and accept him into your life confessing that you're a sinner.
[time=3393] Confessing that you are powerless accepting the provision of God and through prayer calling upon him in salvation.
[time=3404] Our Father we pray.
