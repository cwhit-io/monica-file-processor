[time=61] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=63] These are exciting days in the United States of America.
[time=71] Exciting because, for the first time in our history, words which have meant so much to us as Christians for so many years have now become words that are used and sometimes
[time=85] understood by people everywhere.
[time=88] In a recent issue of a national magazine, the term "born again" was all over the front cover.
[time=94] Now, to be sure in that issue, the term meant a political rebirth.
[time=99] But five years ago, that couldn't have happened.
[time=101] People would not have understood anything at all about the term "born again." There is another term that is often used as it relates to spiritual things, and that is the term "lost." What does it mean to be lost?
[time=116] Most all of us know what it means to be lost.
[time=118] Geographically, but what does it mean to be lost spiritually?
[time=124] That's the subject of our discussion today from the Word of God.
[time=127] In a few moments, we'll be turning to the 15th chapter of the Book of Luke, sharing a great story about a man who was lost and what it meant in his life.
[time=138] First of all, we have some great music.
[time=139] Our special guests today are Dick and Dottie Anthony.
[time=143] And some of you know of their ministry, and I know you're going to appreciate their part in our service.
[time=148] Our choir is singing today a song that was arranged by Dick Anthony, a song with a one-word title.
[time=157] The word is "why." The choir is under the direction today of our Minister of Music, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=163] [MUSIC]
[time=177] (SINGING) Tell me, my, what's in there?
[time=183] Jesus, how now bear the will of grand pride.
[time=193] Tell me, my, what's in there.
[time=201] All my little days on the internet, we will move on to the dream.
[time=216] Jesus, the devil, my symbol in pain.
[time=226] Give me love and song for me.
[time=231] I should he love me, slither on sun or bright.
[time=244] Tell me, why should he care?
[time=250] I do not wear it, but I love me, as sure as high.
[time=259] Tell me, why should he care?
[time=264] All my little days on the internet,
[time=275] we build them all to the dream.
[time=283] Jesus, the devil, my symbol in pain.
[time=293] Give me love and song for me.
[time=300] Love me.
[time=305] Thank you, choir.
[time=317] That is a good question, and I'm grateful that the Bible has an answer.
[time=321] And if we have come to Christ personally, we are part of the answer.
[time=325] What a thrill it is for us to introduce to you, Dick and Dottie Anthony.
[time=329] We have known them through their ministry for many years.
[time=333] They have had a great part in what goes on musically in our country today among evangelical churches.
[time=339] Dick is not only a wonderful vocalist, a great arranger, and songwriter, a tremendous pianist, and organist.
[time=346] He has done a great deal to promote the kind of sacred music that we believe in in this church.
[time=352] And his wife is with him today, an outstanding harpist.
[time=356] And this is the first time we've ever had the privilege of this beautiful instrument being played here in the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=364] So with real enthusiasm and expectancy, we welcome the Anthony's to us and trust that God will use them as they minister to us now.

[time=1350] You'd be interested to know that Mr. Anthony not only performed that song, he wrote it, the words and the lyrics, beautiful testimony to the Christian life.
[time=1360] Now I want you to take your Bibles, and let's all turn together to Luke chapter 15, the 15th chapter of the Book of Luke.
[time=1368] Everyone with your Bibles open, if you're sitting next to someone who doesn't have a Bible, share yours with them, and let's open the Bible together.
[time=1377] I want to read the 11th verses and following Luke chapter 15, beginning at verse 11, and it's a story that most of you are familiar with.
[time=1386] I trust that God will make it as new to us today as we read and study it together.
[time=1392] Luke chapter 15 and verse 11.
[time=1395] And he said, "A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.'
[time=1406] And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after that, the younger son gathered altogether and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
[time=1417] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land, and he began to be in want.
[time=1423] And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
[time=1431] And he would feign have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat, and no man gave unto him.
[time=1439] And when he came to himself, he said, "How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and despair, and I perish with hunger.
[time=1450] I will arise and go to my father, and I will say unto him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.'
[time=1458] And am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants, and he arose and came to his father.
[time=1466] But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
[time=1473] And the son said unto him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.'
[time=1480] But the father said to his servants, 'Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
[time=1487] Bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and be merry. For this my son was dead, and is alive again.
[time=1495] He was lost, and is found, and they began to be merry.'
[time=1501] The Bible says this man was lost. Shall we pray? Father in heaven, we ask that in these moments that are before us,
[time=1514] you will help us to gain insight into this parable which thou hast given to us in the word of God,
[time=1521] to teach us the condition of a man who according to the Bible is lost.
[time=1528] And may we see the estate of such in one in a way that would cause us, as Christians, to have great compassion in our own hearts,
[time=1538] that we might reach out to those who do not know thee.
[time=1544] And yet at the same time may those who hear this message who do not know our Savior, understand that the Father has something for them far better than what they know,
[time=1555] and Lord opened their hearts to receive it.
[time=1559] We pray that in these next moments you will put from our hearts and our minds the thoughts of other things that would distract our concentration from the word of God, help us to center in upon thy truth, make us to be willing and receptive and obedient hearers,
[time=1575] bless thy word to our hearts today. In Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1582] The Lord Jesus Christ has been called by some the master teacher.
[time=1587] As you study the techniques of his pedagogy, his teaching methodology, you soon learn why he has been given such a title.
[time=1597] One of his great tools in teaching was the use of illustrations. The Bible calls them parables.
[time=1605] In this passage, which we have read today, the Lord teaches through the means of one parable.
[time=1612] It is a parable with three parts. Sometimes people refer to it as three separate parables,
[time=1618] but the Scripture is clear that it is all part and parcel of one parable.
[time=1622] It is the parable of lostness.
[time=1625] And in the 15th chapter there are the records of three things that were lost.
[time=1631] There is the story of lost sheep, there is the story of a lost piece of silver,
[time=1637] and there is the record of a lost son.
[time=1641] These parables were given by the Lord Jesus Christ in response to questions that were put to him
[time=1647] by the publicans and sinners, and by the Pharisees and scribes.
[time=1653] The publicans and sinners representing the worst of the humanity, the off scouring of civilization,
[time=1659] and the Pharisees and scribes representing the up and outers, the religious aristocracy of Jesus' day.
[time=1666] The Scripture begins in the 15th chapter verses 1 and 2 with these words.
[time=1671] Then drew near unto Jesus all the tax collectors or publicans and sinners to hear him.
[time=1677] And the Pharisees and scribes murmured saying, "This man, Jesus, receiveth sinners and Edith with them."
[time=1687] The Lord then set forth the threefold parable in the rest of this chapter to explain to the Pharisees and the scribes why he felt so comfortable eating with the publicans and sinners,
[time=1700] and why he had gone out of his way to reach out to those who did not know him as the Pharisees and scribes had claimed to know him.
[time=1709] Now these parables are very interesting.
[time=1712] They give to us the interest of an Almighty God in an individual.
[time=1719] In the parable of the sheep we have our Lord seeking out for one out of a hundred.
[time=1725] There were a hundred sheep, one was lost and he went after them.
[time=1730] In the parable of the silver there were ten coins, one was lost and the Scripture says in the parable that a great search in the sweeping of the house took place trying to find and recover the lost piece of silver.
[time=1743] In the parable of the lost son the ratio was one out of two.
[time=1748] There were two sons, one of which was lost and as most of us who have read the parable many times
[time=1754] understand probably both of whom were lost, one who knew it and one who did not.
[time=1760] This is one of the great stories of the Bible.
[time=1763] Some have said it's the greatest story in all of the New Testament.
[time=1766] You could describe it as a play or as a drama.
[time=1769] It is a five act play, five different places, five different settings does this story touch upon.
[time=1775] First of all act one takes place in the old homestead and the father's love is available.
[time=1781] Act number two takes place in the far country and the father's love is wanting.
[time=1786] Act number three is that which takes place of all places in a pig pen or in the swine herd
[time=1793] and the father's help is needed.
[time=1795] Act number four takes place on the road back home and the father's love and forgiveness is expected.
[time=1803] Act number five takes place as the joyful welcome of a lost one comes to the fruition in the hearts and minds of a family
[time=1812] and the scripture says there was great merriment.
[time=1815] Now what I'd like to suggest to you today as we discuss this story is this, that this passage of scripture is for us today the parable or the illustration or the teaching of what it is like for a son to be without his father.
[time=1831] It is the story of a relationship between a son and his father physically
[time=1837] in order that we might learn the relationship between a son and his father spiritually.
[time=1843] This story tells us what happens to a man who loses his relationship with his father
[time=1849] or who does not have his relationship with the father.
[time=1853] Now there are some scholars who tell us that the story of the lost son is a story about a Christian man,
[time=1860] a what we might call saved man who got out of fellowship with the father but there is great evidence to teach us that this is also an illustration of a man who never came to understand his place
[time=1872] and relationship with his father.
[time=1875] I'd like for us to describe for a moment what it was like for this young man to be lost.
[time=1880] The scripture says clearly that this was one who was lost.
[time=1884] What does it mean today for a man to be lost?
[time=1889] I know it's a term which has a great deal of emotional overtones for some.
[time=1894] Some of you probably have heard that and you consider that to be a word for the religious fanatics
[time=1901] and you say I'm not lost and don't try to find me and all the rest of that.
[time=1905] You don't want to talk about being lost but it is a word which occurs in the scripture.
[time=1909] It is a good word and it's a word that we ought to understand.
[time=1912] We can understand it through the experience of this young man.
[time=1916] The first thing I want you to notice about this man is the restlessness of this lost man.
[time=1921] The scripture records beginning in the verse that we started our reading with a few moments ago, verse 11, that a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the portion of goods which pertaineth unto me." Now the scripture does not read to us between the lines but it is quite obvious what has happened here.
[time=1941] Here is a young man who has come up against the restraint in his own life and he wants his freedom.
[time=1948] Life has many bright opportunities for this young man but he cannot see them because of the restraint that is placed upon him being a part of his father's home.
[time=1958] He is living in his home as a son under the law.
[time=1962] There are certain rules that are pertaining to his household that he must obey.
[time=1966] And as he has grown up now to being of age he has decided that he no longer wishes to live
[time=1972] under the restrictions that are his in his household.
[time=1975] He is not satisfied. He feels chafed. He feels hemmed in.
[time=1979] He wants to get away from his father in home. He could not find his environment at home a pleasant one
[time=1985] so he seeks a way to escape from it. There is a spirit of restlessness within his heart.
[time=1991] The request of his restlessness is found in verse 12. He said to his father, "Give me mine.
[time=1998] Give me the portion of goods that pertaineth to me." It is obvious from the record that this man, about whom the scripture says that he was lost,
[time=2009] was more interested in possessions than in the presence of his father.
[time=2014] He was anxious to have the things that he could feel and see and touch, but he was not anxious to be in the presence of his father, even though the scripture is clear that his father loved him deeply, had everything in his heart to do good for his son, yet this man wanted to be free.
[time=2032] And his request gives away his priorities.
[time=2037] In an oriental home, in the home of a Jewish person, in the home of this young man,
[time=2047] they operated under the laws of inheritance that operated this way.
[time=2052] The older son in the family at the time of the announcement of the inheritance would be given two shares of the entire estate. The younger son would be given one.
[time=2064] When the young man asked for everything that was his or would be his when his father died,
[time=2070] in essence what he was doing was disinheriting himself.
[time=2075] He was asking his father to estimate what might properly be his in the future and give it to him now,
[time=2081] and by doing that he was giving everything left to his older brother so that when his father died,
[time=2088] his older brother could have it all. He was doing what many lost people do today.
[time=2092] He was trading the future for the present. He was saying, "I don't care about the future.
[time=2098] I don't care what might be mine or what is mine that I somehow need to inherit later." He was saying, "In essence, I want it now. I want everything that's coming to me right now." And the scripture said his request was that he could spend himself with everything that he had on the present.
[time=2115] One of the characteristics of spiritually lost men is that they live for the present without regard for the future.
[time=2121] They are anxious to have everything now and they care not for the future.
[time=2126] They are willing to spend and be spent without regard for the fact that there is a future day coming
[time=2132] when we shall all give an account before the father. He wanted his freedom.
[time=2139] He was not willing to trade the freedom that was his in his father's house for the freedom that he envisioned in the far country.
[time=2149] It is interesting to note that spiritually if a man does not understand his heavenly father's desire to provide for him,
[time=2159] if he has never come into a personal relationship with his heavenly father through faith in Jesus Christ, he will always make the decision that this man made.
[time=2168] All over this country today, here in our city, and perhaps even among us this morning, are men who are giving away the future, not just spiritually, but as far as their home is concerned and everything.
[time=2179] They are doing everything they can for now and they refuse to face the fact that there is a future.
[time=2185] The restlessness of this lost man.
[time=2190] Now I want to show you secondly the responsibility of this lost man.
[time=2195] It is interesting to note that when the young man asked for all that would be his, the father consented,
[time=2201] it is a solemn thought that is here expressed in this text.
[time=2205] The sinner is often abandoned to the desires of his own heart.
[time=2211] It is interesting to me that in the providence of God, God always respects man's individuality and his independence.
[time=2219] And if a man says, "I will live without God," then God will allow him to do that.
[time=2228] If a man says, "I want it all now, I'll not think about the future," then God will allow him to spend himself on the present.
[time=2238] And the scripture says that the father gave to the son his desire.
[time=2243] Someone has described man's own self destiny in these words.
[time=2248] Lord of himself, heritage of woe, that's what he had.
[time=2253] He had everything he wanted, but he did not know that in getting it he was getting destruction.
[time=2259] God gives the restless man over to his folly.
[time=2262] Some of you listening to my voice today have neglected the father, God the father in your life.
[time=2268] You've neglected that spiritual part, that spiritual dimension of your life.
[time=2272] And you have said, "I will live without God." And in your determination to do that, God will allow you to do it because he does not operate as one who controls us as automatons,
[time=2282] but he gives to every man the freedom of will and choice.
[time=2286] And if we choose to live without him, we can do it, and God will let it happen.
[time=2291] But let us trace the downward direction of this man.
[time=2295] Notice, thirdly, the retribution of this lost man.
[time=2299] The scripture records very clearly that he went into a far country, there he wasted his substance with riotous living,
[time=2308] and when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in the land, and he began to be in want.
[time=2315] The first thing we notice in this whole matter of the result of his desire for independence is the matter of waste.
[time=2323] Off at once he went, riotous living at the very top of his priority list.
[time=2329] Freedom his only consideration, he would have his fling.
[time=2334] May I say to you that whenever a man determines to live for himself, he has started on the road toward waste.
[time=2341] For living for self is always waste.
[time=2345] I'm appalled at the books that are filling our bookstores these days, how to be number one.
[time=2350] How to manipulate other people so you can be number one.
[time=2354] How to get all you can while you can.
[time=2357] How to run roughshod over people so that you can be all that you should be.
[time=2361] That's the common thought among men today, but the end thereof is destruction.
[time=2365] For living for oneself is waste and will end up where this man ended up.
[time=2372] The scripture says he wasted everything that he had, that which was to be his in the future was now gone.
[time=2377] He spent it without reckoning upon the spending of it.
[time=2382] The second thing we notice in this passage of scripture was not only the concept of waste, but secondly we see that he came upon a famine.
[time=2390] Having spent everything that he had, the outward circumstances of his life now seem to be working against him.
[time=2397] May I say to you this morning that whenever a man or a woman or a young person determines that they will have their freedom
[time=2405] and they have come to the place in their own life where they say I want everything that's mine, I want it now,
[time=2412] I want all of my freedom, that there is a sense in which though they may be free, they are still hemmed in by at least two boundaries. One of them is the boundary within themselves.
[time=2422] That boundary is the remorse, the feeling of guilt, the self-havic that is wreaked upon their bodies
[time=2429] through the waste of their own energies, both physical and spiritually.
[time=2433] Secondly, there are the circumstances around them that somehow in a very ironic and uncanny way
[time=2439] seem to cooperate with that which they're doing.
[time=2443] It is interesting to me that while this man was beginning to be in want in his heart and in his mind and in his spirit, the outward circumstances of his life contributed and cooperated with it.
[time=2454] There was famine outwardly and there was emptiness inwardly.
[time=2458] How often that's true in our lives.
[time=2461] When we have neglected the spiritual dynamic that God has made available to us through his word in the person of his son Jesus Christ, oftentimes God lets us go on in our own way until finally
[time=2473] and ultimately we have come to the end of ourselves and the very circumstances of life seem to be crying out against us in cooperation with God's Holy Spirit to bring conviction to our own heart.
[time=2487] This man was lost. He was now in spiritual and physical famine.
[time=2494] His spiritual life and his physical life were in harmony with one another.
[time=2501] The Scripture says he was at the end of himself.
[time=2505] The third thing about his retribution beside waste and famine is the concept of reproach.
[time=2511] I'm certain there's no way I can possibly describe to you what it would have been like for a man of the heritage of this young man to finally and ultimately end up in the pig pen feeding the swine.
[time=2523] But the Scripture records that when he had spent all and the famine came, he joined himself to a citizen of that country and he went into the fields to feed the swines
[time=2533] and because he had no money to buy food and there was nothing available to him, he began to take the swine pods that were made available for the animals of that day
[time=2543] and to gorge himself with that because there was nothing left.
[time=2547] It is a contrast that one cannot miss as they see what has happened to him.
[time=2552] He has come now to the point in his own life where he had sought for pleasure and now he is reaping pain.
[time=2559] The Scripture says that he came to his father and he wanted his freedom and it was given to him by his father but noticed the text.
[time=2565] It says he joined himself unto a citizen. He became a slave.
[time=2570] The man who had sought for freedom was now enslaved by that which he thought would be the answer to his need.
[time=2577] May I say to you today that a man who rejects God out of the desire for the freedom and the opportunity to be away from the restraints of Christianity as they envisioned them,
[time=2589] is a man who is only trading what he believes to be slavery for what ultimately really becomes slavery.
[time=2596] The Bible says that the commands of Christ and God are not grievous.
[time=2600] I don't know a Christian who is walking in fellowship with the Lord who is going around complaining because this life is so hard and he can't enjoy life.
[time=2608] Christians have the enjoyment that no one understands unless they have come to Christ.
[time=2612] But here was a man who threw all of the privileges of his father's house away.
[time=2617] He said goodbye to everything that was his by inheritance and he thought that in doing that he would reap the joy that he sought.
[time=2624] Now we see him at the end of that search and he is a slave to a citizen of a far country.
[time=2629] He is down groveling in the very mire of life feeding the swine.
[time=2633] How many young people there are who have left the moorings of their Christian teaching,
[time=2639] the principles that have been inculcated into them when they were younger, thinking that they wanted their freedom only to discover that in seeking for freedom, they have found themselves to be in bondage, reproach.
[time=2653] Here he is feeding the swine.
[time=2657] He had spent his bankroll, no friends were around now.
[time=2661] Later on in the text, the older brother gives us this insight into the story.
[time=2666] The older brother said he spent his substance with harlots in loose living.
[time=2671] You don't read of any of the pretty girls he ran with down there with him now.
[time=2678] No one is there to give him any help. He's homeless, he's empty, he's without himself even.
[time=2686] And the scripture says he came to himself.
[time=2695] Say let me ask you what does it mean to be lost?
[time=2702] We know from the story because we read it from the beginning to the end that even before he walked out of his father's home he was lost.
[time=2711] We know that as he walked down toward the far country on that road toward the spending of his substance that he was lost.
[time=2718] We know that while he was spending himself with the harlots and all of the things that were going on in his own life,
[time=2725] that were totally against what he knew to be right, that he was lost.
[time=2731] We know that when he finally came to the end of himself and had no money left and had nothing left that he could use for self-preservation and he finally went to a stranger and asked to become a slave, we know that he was lost.
[time=2747] But he didn't know he was lost until finally he had come to the end of his own ability to change the situation.
[time=2758] I want to say to you that sooner or later God brings every one of us to that point, the Bible says that a man without God is lost.
[time=2765] That means he's lost to any utilitarian purpose as far as God's program is concerned.
[time=2770] He's lost to heaven, he's lost to the joy of this life, he's lost to eternity.
[time=2774] But the sad fact of the matter is that most men don't understand that they're lost until finally they have been reduced to nothing.
[time=2783] And they have to look up from where they are in the mire of this life and realize that they have nothing.
[time=2791] That's what the Scripture means when it says this man came to himself.
[time=2795] Let's talk about his recovery for a moment.
[time=2798] The Bible says first of all he reflected.
[time=2802] He was filling himself with the food that belonged to animals and he came to himself, says verse 17, he reflected.
[time=2812] He realized what he had done.
[time=2814] That's the moment of truth in each of our lives.
[time=2816] Everyone here who has come to Christ somewhere along the way has come to that moment.
[time=2821] We have come to ourselves, we have seen ourselves in light of our situation.
[time=2825] But notice secondly after he reflected, he recollected, he began to think about home and he said there are people back home in the slave relationship that live better than I'm living.
[time=2837] There are people back home that don't have anything like I had when I came down here who now have it better than I had.
[time=2843] He began to remember my what a tremendous tool in the hand of God is the power of memory.
[time=2849] Some of you who are here today without Jesus Christ having rejected the opportunity to know God can think back at this very moment to the time as you were growing up in a Sunday school class.
[time=2859] So perhaps at your mother's knee someone opened the word and began to tell you about Jesus Christ and once in a while that flashes back in your mind.
[time=2867] That's the tool of God to help you remember that there's another way.
[time=2871] That's what was happening to this man down in the far country away from everything out of touch with home.
[time=2876] He began to think back to what had been his.
[time=2879] He recollected.
[time=2881] But will you notice thirdly that he realized his own situation he said I perish verse 17.
[time=2889] My father and his servants are living well but I perish.
[time=2893] It is a hard thing for a man without God to come finally to that point in his life when he's willing to say I perish.
[time=2901] Here was a man who said I am lost.
[time=2905] That's when that man realized his situation no man can ever know what it's like to be in fellowship with the father until first of all he sees himself without God.
[time=2916] Here's what this man saw and then will you notice that he resolved in his own heart to do something about it.
[time=2924] The scripture said that he said I will arise. I will go to my father and I will say unto him.
[time=2935] Say what is conversion?
[time=2937] We hear once in a while about people being converted. What does that mean?
[time=2942] Conversion in the truest sense of the word means to change one's mind to turn around in the road and go the other direction.
[time=2950] Here was a young man who was going down down down to destruction and finally he came to the point where he saw himself as God saw him.
[time=2960] He saw himself in his own situation and he said I will.
[time=2967] And at that moment he began to turn and go back to his father.
[time=2972] Will you notice also that a part of his recovery was repentance.
[time=2977] He said I will go back to my father and I will say father I have sinned.
[time=2984] The hardest thing for any man to admit is that he's a sinner.
[time=2988] I think the most difficult thing for all of us to face up to is the fact that we need God and when we come to grips with our need for God it ultimately comes to us that the reason we need him is because we are sinners.
[time=3000] This man said I have sinned. You know that in the Bible there are eight different people who said it one time or another I have sinned.
[time=3007] Four of them said it without meaning it. Four of them said it in truth and reality.
[time=3013] One of those four was this prodigal son. He said I have sinned.
[time=3018] The thing that will keep you from God today and from the blessings of the father's house.
[time=3023] The thing that will cause you to be eternally lost more than any one thing is this. Your refusal to admit to yourself that you have sinned and that you are a sinner.
[time=3034] I want you to notice that having said he had sinned he now wins his way back home and as he comes there is restoration.
[time=3048] I don't think there's a more poignant, more beautiful picture in all the Bible than the scene that must have taken place on the road that day between this father and his son.
[time=3057] Many have tried to imagine what it had been like for his mother and father during the days of the son's absence.
[time=3065] Certainly they often talked about their younger son who was gone.
[time=3070] It is not accidental that the scripture says that long before he became obviously in view of the homestead that his father saw him notice the scripture says the father saw him a great way off.
[time=3085] Does that not tell us that his father had been waiting anxiously, earnestly trying his very best to see down that road as far as possible hoping that his son would come home?
[time=3097] And then one day upon that road into the view of that loving father came the sight of that young boy stooped over with the effects of his sin.
[time=3105] Certainly a much different looking thing than that had left his home.
[time=3111] But all the picture of mercy that's involved in that reunion someone has said that the father saw him with eyes of mercy.
[time=3119] He ran to him on legs of mercy. The Bible says that he wrapped his arms around him and hugged him with arms of mercy and he kissed him with lips of mercy.
[time=3130] And he said, "Son, welcome home." If you read the text carefully you can almost see in your mind's eye that as the son begins to say, "Father, I have sinned and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."
[time=3143] That he's about to say, "Let me be one of your servants and in my mind's eye can see the father reach out his hand and cover his mouth."
[time=3149] And he said, "I'll have none of that, son. You've come back. I welcome you back. My arms are open to receive you."
[time=3157] And he brought those things which pertain to his standing as a son and placed them upon him and he became one of the father's family.
[time=3168] May I say to you today that for every step you take in the direction of God he takes ten in your direction.
[time=3177] For every move you make toward him as the father, he waits with open arms to reach out and receive you into his own loving care.
[time=3189] If you are lost today without God and without Christ and you're in the far country in your own way of living and you've rejected Jesus Christ and you don't know what it means to know him personally,
[time=3200] if you will come to yourself and see yourself as God sees you, recognize what the Bible says about you to be true that without Christ you are lost.
[time=3209] And you take one step in the direction of the father with arms of mercy, he reaches out to receive you because that's the kind of God that he is.
[time=3218] And the Scripture says that the result of such a meeting is finally rejoicing.
[time=3224] Just as it says in the Scripture that he began to be in want, the Bible is clear that when restored to his father they began to be married.
[time=3236] Twice in this text it tells us that there is great joy in heaven when a sinner repents.
[time=3242] I often say that when someone comes to Christ and receives Jesus Christ as personal Savior comes into fellowship with the father that the angels in heaven are rejoicing and the Bible tells us that that's true.
[time=3254] What a time of rejoicing that was.
[time=3258] Now let me ask you to think about this as far as your own life is concerned.
[time=3263] What does it mean to be lost?
[time=3265] It means to be without the father. It means to be without a relationship to God.
[time=3271] Just as this son was without a relationship with his earthly father, a man who is without a relationship with his heavenly father according to this text is a lost man.
[time=3282] But one does not have to stay that way.
[time=3285] The Bible holds out a great invitation to all who would seek to know God in a personal way and gives to us this beautiful picture of the loving father, arms outstretched ready to receive those who will come into fellowship with him through Jesus Christ.
[time=3301] And today, just as really as if he stood at the front of this building, God in heaven reaches out to welcome you who may be without Christ and says to you, welcome, come home, be a part of the family.
[time=3318] He's willing to accept.
[time=3320] Shall we pray?
[time=3322] Father, not one of us in this auditorium can say that we have not been lost.
[time=3333] For every one of us at any part, any time in our life without God have been in the same condition as this young man.
[time=3343] Thank you Father for your mercy and your love.
[time=3346] Thank you for being willing to accept us as we come back to thee.
[time=3351] And it is our prayer today as we close this service that if there are those here.
