[time=15] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=25] [MUSIC]
[time=55] And all God's people said, and you may be seated.
[time=62] >> And we extend each of you a welcome to our service today.
[time=68] We thank you for being here.
[time=70] We trust that it'll be an hour of encouragement and inspiration and blessing to you as you share a very special Sunday with us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=80] Ten years ago today, the Black Hawk Baptist Church was born.
[time=85] 1969, a group of seven families that you will meet in a little bit, brought this church into being through the faith of their commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ and their desire to please him to raise up a testimony in this area.
[time=100] And so today, we're celebrating our 10th anniversary as a church, and it's a joy to have you all here with us for this opportunity to praise God together for what he has done.
[time=110] Our Mother Church, the Emmanuel Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, has sent to us the beautiful flowers which you see in front of you as a congratulations to us as a church for 10 years of ministry.
[time=124] We express our appreciation to Pastor Roy Clark and all of the folks at Immanuel for all they've done to be an encouragement to us and for this show of encouragement on this special day.
[time=136] Our guest on our 10th anniversary is Mr. Steve Bolt.
[time=140] He's been with us many times on special days, and we're so grateful that God made it possible for him to share this special occasion with us.
[time=148] He's going to join with our choir now as they sing a great anthem that you will all recognize.
[time=153] It's not just good for patriotic occasions.
[time=156] It's good for every occasion when we praise God for the liberty that we have in our country and for what God has done for us as a church.
[time=164] [MUSIC]
[time=194] My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
[time=206] He's trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath
[time=215] are stored.
[time=217] He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword.
[time=228] His truth is marching on.
[time=240] [MUSIC]
[time=270] I have read of fiery gospel written burnished rows of steel as you deal with my contempt and soul with you my gracial deal.
[time=280] Let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel while God is marching on.
[time=291] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=430] [APPLAUSE]
[time=450] >> Thank you, Choir and Steve.
[time=452] And we'll hear from him again in just a moment.
[time=454] And the choir is going to sing again in a moment.
[time=456] But right now I want you to meet some very special people.
[time=458] Here are most of the people who were here the first Sunday that the Black Hawk Baptist Church ever met ten years ago.
[time=466] Standing in front of you are Mr. and Mrs. Robert Mishler.
[time=469] Mr. and Mrs. Marvin Neff.
[time=471] Mr. and Mrs. Larry Fager.
[time=473] Mr. and Mrs. Larry Orrin and Donna Jeremiah.
[time=476] There were three other families which are now in other churches and other places.
[time=481] But these folks were the core group who believed God
[time=487] for the Black Hawk Baptist Church to come into existence.
[time=490] And of all the people who deserve the credit for what God has done for us in these past ten years had it not been for these folks.
[time=498] There would be no Black Hawk Baptist Church today.
[time=501] Let's tell them that we appreciate their faith, shall we?
[time=504] [ Applause ]
[time=518] I tried to get all of them to say a word, but they were just glad to come out and stand.
[time=524] [ Laughter ] Now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir as they remind us that though there is a human element in what God does in this world, that in Christian circles and among God's people, the human element is only the instrument, the channel.
[time=544] The glory and the honor and the credit belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=548] It is His church.
[time=550] And we are just instruments in His hands.
[time=552] We give Him the tribute and the glory and the praise for all that He's done.
[time=560] And for what God has done, He has always used a man.
[time=564] Dale Sigling is going to come and talk about that right now.
[time=568] I like for Pastor Jeremiah to come forward if he would.
[time=576] This is a surprise to him, we believe.
[time=579] [ Laughter ] He doesn't usually expect to see me on this side of the audience.
[time=585] In these last days, we've celebrated with the pastor on Friday with the Super 60s some remembrances in these last 10 years.
[time=594] And just a few moments ago, you applauded the families that were a part of that.
[time=599] But today we're also celebrating the 10th anniversary of David Jeremiah as pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=607] Yesterday in the newspapers in this local area, you had the opportunity to see a special ad that was provided by the members of the Board of Deacons of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=617] We have just a couple more things we want to share with you.
[time=620] The staff of the Black Hawk Baptist Church has presented this plaque
[time=626] which reads, "Congratulations, Pastor David Jeremiah
[time=632] for the 10 years of service to the Lord and the Black Hawk Baptist Church." We are sincerely grateful for your strong biblical emphasis and Christian leadership in our lives and ministries and it's signed by the members of the professional staff.
[time=646] And there are three pictures on there.
[time=648] There's a picture of the original church.
[time=653] And there's a picture of the future church at Arlington Park.
[time=657] On behalf of the staff, we'd like to present this plaque to you, Pastor.
[time=660] Thank you, Dale.
[time=661] God bless you.
[time=662] And I'm not quite finished.
[time=663] Okay.
[time=664] [ Laughter ] One of the other things that is vital in the ministry of the church is the people of the church.
[time=671] The church is not the original families.
[time=673] The church is not the staff.
[time=675] And the church is not the pastor.
[time=677] The church is the people.
[time=679] And today I'm certain, as many of you walk out from here, you will share some remembrance or some thought with the pastor of what his ministry and what this church has meant your lives.
[time=689] But we've done a little bit more than that, Pastor.
[time=691] We have collected, in the last few days, a series of reflections, 10th anniversary reflections, where the people of this church have written to you a very personal note, saying what your ministry means to them and what the ministry of this church means.
[time=705] We'd like to present this to you.
[time=707] Thank you.
[time=708] That'll be a remembrance.
[time=709] Some days, when you're a little discouraged, you can reflect through that and be encouraged.
[time=714] Then last, but not least, we'd like to present this love offering to you, which has been collected from the people of the church.
[time=720] Congratulations.
[time=721] Thank you very much.
[time=722] [APPLAUSE - 46 seconds]
[time=772] Thank you very much.
[time=773] Thank you, Dale.
[time=776] If you don't cut this out, I won't have time to preach.
[time=779] [laughter] I'm so grateful to all of you who have had a part in this.
[time=784] It's been a great adventure for us.
[time=786] We thank God for what He's done here.
[time=790] I know that in our own lives, we talked about it this week, that it shows what God can do from someone who doesn't deserve it just if they're willing.
[time=801] And I guess if there's anything we've been willing for God to do what He wants us to do.
[time=805] We don't have anything great to offer except the willing heart and He wants to do that in all of our lives.
[time=811] And it's exciting to see that happen.
[time=813] God wants to use us, and He does, and it's thrilling.
[time=816] And sometimes we just step back from it all and we say, "Lord, I don't understand how you let me come along for this ride, but thank you." And I thank all of you wonderful people who've made this a very special day in our lives.
[time=827] And I want you to know I will treasure and read with great anticipation this diary that you've presented to us.
[time=835] Well, we just thank you and praise God for what He's done.
[time=839] Thank God for all of you.
[time=841] I think we'd better listen to the choir.
[time=865] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=1027] Thank you so much for joining us on today's edition of the Bible Hour and this is a very special edition.
[time=1035] Donna, it doesn't seem possible that it's ten years ago today that the Black Hawk Baptist Church came into existence.
[time=1041] An awful lot has happened in those years, hasn't it?
[time=1044] It sure has. We've seen our congregation go from starting families of seven up to our current attendance of approximately 1,200.
[time=1055] And along with that, we've added four children to our family and a number of gray hairs to your head.
[time=1062] Well, it's been a decade of growth and excitement and something really to be praising the Lord for,
[time=1068] and that He's let us have a part in it all. It's been an exciting time.
[time=1072] We also are celebrating another anniversary today. This is the fifth year anniversary of the Bible Hour Television Ministry.
[time=1079] And God has blessed that in a wonderful way too over these past five years.
[time=1083] We have just recently identified some very special people who are helping us during these particular days with the support of the television ministry.
[time=1092] We call them associate sponsors. They're individuals who send gifts of $100 to underwrite the cost of television in the area where they happen to be able to watch the program.
[time=1102] And I know you want to introduce some of those folks to our friends at home, so why don't you tell us about them?
[time=1107] We have four different people who are sponsoring our program today in different areas.
[time=1112] In Fort Wayne, Mr. and Mrs. Vernon Barker, who are also members of our Founders Club, and watch on Channel 21.
[time=1120] They are one of our associate sponsors today. Also Paul E. Norman watches on 21 and indicated that he wanted to have a part in today's broadcast.
[time=1130] Mr. and Mrs. Paul Newinschwander, also Founders members, watch on 21 here in Fort Wayne, and Dave Daisy, who is from South Bend and watches on Channel 46.
[time=1142] And we would like to say a special word of thank you to you folks for your interest and willingness to support the Bible Hour in your area.
[time=1151] Three from Fort Wayne and one from South Bend, that's exciting, and we're grateful to God for each of these folks and many others who will be introducing to you in the weeks ahead.
[time=1161] If you are interested in knowing more about the sponsors program, we would encourage you to write us and let us know. We'll be happy to send you the information.
[time=1169] During these past few days, many of you have received a letter from my desk, sharing with you first of all my excitement and enthusiasm for the response we have had this summer to the Bible Hour,
[time=1179] and for the many faithful ones who have given sacrificially to help us eliminate a debt that accrued over the past year,
[time=1185] and also to challenge all of you to pray with us about some unique opportunities God has put in our way as we look forward to this new year of television.
[time=1194] As I mentioned in the letter, there are three stations now that have asked for the Bible Hour television program.
[time=1199] We want desperately to be able to extend this ministry to those areas, but we are committed to cleaning up that past indebtedness first, and we are so grateful to the many who have helped us,
[time=1210] and we encourage you to continue to pray and give sacrificially as God enables you to do it.
[time=1215] During these past several weeks, Donna, we have introduced to our friends at home a very special little book called the Answer Book.
[time=1223] I just talked with the man who is in charge of our television ministry, and he told us that we have had a greater response to this gift offer than to any other literature that we have ever made available to our friends at home.
[time=1236] Why don't you take just a moment and share with our friends what the answer book is for those who may be watching for the first time.
[time=1242] The answer book contains God's answer to the problems that we face in our everyday lives, and the society in which we live today, many of us face the problem of guilt and sin in our lives, or we are concerned about forgiveness, or we need comfort.
[time=1261] And if you have a need in any of these areas, if you pick up the answer book and turn to that particular heading, it gives God's answer by way of quoting actual scripture, which gives you God's answer for that particular problem.
[time=1277] Donna, there are so many people today who face discouragement in their lives.
[time=1281] Just the day-to-day routine of living in a very fast-paced world, it's interesting to note that the Word of God has many passages that are available to us to help us be encouraged instead of discouraged.
[time=1295] One of the great passages in this little answer book is about two and a half pages of verses of scripture to help those who may be discouraged.
[time=1304] If you haven't received your copy of the answer book already, we'd encourage you to write us this week and request it. It's absolutely free. It is our joy to send it to you upon your request.
[time=1314] The answer book is small enough to fit in your coat pocket men. Ladies, it will fit conveniently into your purse and you can carry it with you wherever you go.
[time=1324] When you write, be sure to write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1342] That's the address you should use to request the answer book and also to ask for information about the sponsors club.
[time=1350] If we can do anything to help you and if you would be interested in communicating with us about this ministry, please write to us this week. We'll be looking forward to your letter.
[time=1359] Now, in just a few moments, Don, I have a very special message to share with our friends at home. It's what we call here at Black Hawk, the annual state of the church address.
[time=1368] It is a challenge to our congregation and to all people everywhere who watch as to what God's program for us should be in these next years ahead.
[time=1377] I trust that you'll stay with us and join us for the remainder of this hour as we worship the Lord Jesus Christ together through His Word.
[time=1407] [MUSIC]
[time=1427] Now, once again, before the message, you will listen to the ministry of Steve Bolt. We encourage all of you here in this area.
[time=1434] Those of you present in the service today and those of you from the Fort Wayne area to be with us this evening for the ministry of Mr. Bolt in our evening service, I know he'll be a blessing and an encouragement to you, Steve.
[time=1445] [MUSIC]
[time=1462] I scourge the back of Jesus with thorns I crown His aid. I cursed him and I mocked him. I longed to see him dead.
[time=1489] I laughed with scorn as I followed him up the path to Calvary. I nailed his hands upon a cross.
[time=1512] And his blood ran at my feet, but still he loved me through death for gave me.
[time=1533] My grace he saved me from all my sin.
[time=1544] My heart was filled with shame as I behaved the same. His blood had made for me at Calvary.
[time=1569] [MUSIC]
[time=1579] His friends removed his life less from the king of the Jews was dead. They took him to his palace and there they named his heir.
[time=1607] His palace was a cold dark tomb around which guards betrayed and then that mourn they cried. He's gone.
[time=1629] He has risen from the dead yet still he loved me through death for gave me.
[time=1650] My grace he saved me from all my sin.
[time=1661] And he now lives in my heart from where he led me part.
[time=1672] This Christ who died for me at Calvary.
[time=1701] Thank you Steve for reminding us of our Lord's sacrifice for us on the cross.
[time=1706] I want you to join me in the Word of God this morning in the 13th chapter of the Book of Romans, Romans chapter 13.
[time=1719] Each year at this particular occasion I pray that God will give me some special word for us as a congregation as we begin another year of ministry here in this place.
[time=1730] It is my conviction that God has directed my attention to this portion of Scripture.
[time=1735] And with a great sense of courage and enthusiasm and yet with the solemnity which we shall find in the words we read in a moment, we approach these next years under the good hand and guidance of our Lord.
[time=1749] Romans chapter 13 and we're reading beginning at the eleventh verse, Romans 13, 11.
[time=1757] And that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
[time=1766] The night is far spent, the day is at hand.
[time=1769] Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light.
[time=1774] Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in immorality and wantoness, not in strife and envying, but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
[time=1790] Shall we pray?
[time=1793] Lord, these words are as contemporary as if they were handed down from the throne of glory to us on this very day.
[time=1800] God has a word for us as a church as individual Christians for such a day as this.
[time=1806] We pray that as we set the stage for understanding these words in the light of our times, that you will drive home these very basic simple truths to our hearts that we will understand that you have a plan and a purpose for us as a church, as a group of Christians who gather together to do the work of God.
[time=1827] Strip from our hearts and our minds the thoughts of other things that would keep us from concentrating in these few moments upon God's truth and relating it to our own lives and applying it to our own hearts.
[time=1840] We give the praise in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1845] On other occasions and on other anniversaries, we have taken time to detail what God has done for us as a church.
[time=1854] There have been a great many changes in the past ten years for those of us who have been a part of it from the beginning.
[time=1861] We've seen our congregation grow from a small group to a large group.
[time=1866] We've seen our facilities develop from modular units to the 50,000 plus square feet of facilities that we have here on this property and now 130 acres that God has brought into being for our use in another part of this community.
[time=1883] We have seen many things happen in our church, but while many good things were happening by way of growth and development in our church, the world in which you and I have lived over these past ten years has also changed dramatically.
[time=1901] The world to which this church was called in 1969 is not the same world to which we are called today.
[time=1911] Great, wide sweeping movements of influence have crossed this globe in the last ten years to make it seem almost impossible that the generation and the timeline which was ours in 1969 could have any relationship to that which we know today in 1979.
[time=1930] Recently in a book written by Tim Timmons entitled The Maximum Living in a Pressure Cooker World, he detailed some of the time bombs that are going off in our world today.
[time=1943] He reminds us that from the standpoint of population, we now minister in a world that numbers some four billion people.
[time=1951] Scientists tell us that if the world continues to grow in population at its present rate of 1.87% per year, that in 38 years, the world will double again in population.
[time=1966] One ecologist who was trying to demonstrate the awesomeness of this particular fact has said that in the next 900 years, if we simply just go on duplicating our world every 38 years,
[time=1978] in the next 900 years, there will be 60 million billion people in this world, so many people living on the face of this world that there will be 100 people for every square yard of the earth's surface, including both land and sea.
[time=1998] The biological growth of science in our generation has been highlighted as recently as yesterday when all of us picked up our newspapers to see the face of the first test tube baby born into this generation.
[time=2015] I remember reading some time ago a statement by C.S. Lewis who said that each new power won by man is also a power over man.
[time=2024] And Henry David Thoreau reminded us years ago that sometimes man's tools, sometimes the things that men may have become the tools of their tools.
[time=2038] We're living in a time when our growth in terms of knowledge and technology is no longer at our disposal, but sometimes and quite too often it begins to control us.
[time=2050] It is a time when men's hearts are failing them for fear.
[time=2055] There is hardly a psychologist, psychiatrist, counselor, Christian or non-Christian who does not have an agenda of people longer than the hours of the day that he has to give them.
[time=2067] And the confusing remedies that are prescribed by people who do not know Christ are enough to make the situation far worse than it would be otherwise.
[time=2077] The secular humanism that is filling the counseling rooms of those who know not Christ is as confusing.
[time=2084] As a story I heard some time ago about a French philosopher by the name of Sartre who summed up all of life by saying to be is to do.
[time=2092] During the time of his life there was another philosopher by the name of Camus who contradicted Sartre's philosophy and he said that life is summed up in the statement to do is to be.
[time=2104] And someone has said that no one has ever been able to put those together until Frank Sinatra came along and said do be, do be, do.
[time=2117] The hope of our world does not lie in secular humanism.
[time=2120] Thank God for the Christian counselors that he's raised up in this generation who have a word from God to go along with their understanding of humanism and the human life and the human body and mind.
[time=2133] Along with all that's going on in psychology we have a religious confusion.
[time=2139] Never has there been a time in all of the world when there have been more choices for people religiously.
[time=2145] As if we did not have enough problems in our western world the eastern culture has imported almost one new religion every day during the last three years.
[time=2156] We are impacted and bombarded by every new kind of philosophy that reaches out to man and says here is an answer.
[time=2165] Here is hope. If you'll try this this will work.
[time=2168] Zen Buddhism, the children of light.
[time=2173] Scientology, divine light, Christian consciousness, children of God, love Israel.
[time=2178] You can't keep up with them. A new one is born every day.
[time=2181] It seems as if men will believe anything except the truth in answer to their needs.
[time=2189] While I was on vacation I read a story of a man who was up on his roof repairing his television antenna trying to get ready for the football season.
[time=2197] And he was coming down to the wire just before the important game and so he got in a hurry and when he got in a hurry he lost his balance and he began to slide down the roof.
[time=2206] He got all the way down to the edge of the roof and just at the last moment he grabbed onto the gutter with his hands.
[time=2212] According to the story when he was hanging there in mid-air two stories off the ground he looked down and he hollered is there anybody down there who can help me?
[time=2222] No one was outdoors no one heard him. So in desperation he looked up and he said is there anybody up there who can help me?
[time=2230] According to the story out of the silence came the words believe and let go.
[time=2236] And he said is there anybody else up there who can help me?
[time=2241] I thought as I read that story that sums up almost all of the religious life today we'll take anything else except this believe.
[time=2254] We'll do anything but believe that's the religious culture in which we live.
[time=2259] We could go on and on and on to illustrate in almost every area of life education politics how our world is in a state of flux changing so rapidly that future shock is a present reality in almost every one of our lives.
[time=2278] Politically we are in a state of confusion if the 39 men who band together to sign the Constitution could come back today they would discover that those 39 men in our country had now grown to over 14 million employed to keep the body politic going.
[time=2297] The bureaucracy has taken over and we are in a state of confusion.
[time=2305] What does God say to us at such a time as this? What should be our role in our ministry as a church as we face a kind of a generation that has developed in this last decade?
[time=2316] It is frightening to think what we might be saying 10 years from now if the avalanche continues to snowball in all of these various directions.
[time=2326] I believe God has a word for us, a word for us that is good for us in this particular generation in which you and I are alive and minister.
[time=2336] That word is the word which we have read from the book of Romans. Basically there are four things that I believe God would say to us today from this passage of Scripture.
[time=2346] First of all know the importance of understanding the day in which you live.
[time=2351] For you will note in verse 11 that Paul in writing to the Romans tells us that it is important for us to know the time, knowing the time.
[time=2361] And then in light of our knowledge of the time the first instruction he gives us for our generation is this.
[time=2367] It is a call to be vigilant in our watch and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of our sleep.
[time=2376] Paul said to the Romans and by way of the Holy Spirit to our hearts that we are to be knowing the seasons in which we live because they say something to us about God's program of the ages.
[time=2389] In 1 Chronicles chapter 12 and verse 32 were told that in the days of Israel they were looking for men who had the wisdom to understand their times.
[time=2399] And in the book of Matthew chapter 16 and verse 3 were told that on one occasion our Lord zeroed in on his enemies and he scored them with these words.
[time=2409] He said all you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
[time=2418] The first injunction that we have from God for our day is this.
[time=2421] God has called us to a discernment of our day to a discernment of our times.
[time=2427] Vigilance in light of our Lord's soon return is required for every Christian.
[time=2432] For the Bible says that our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
[time=2437] We could sum that up on this anniversary Sunday that the Lord's return is ten years closer than it was when this church opened its doors for the first time.
[time=2447] The Bible goes on to say that the night of Christ's absence is far spent and the day of his dawning is soon upon us.
[time=2456] The return of Christ is very very soon if the signs of the times can be read with clarity.
[time=2463] God has called us to be aware of the fact that the days are short in which we are to minister.
[time=2468] Someone wrote years ago that coming events always cast a shadow before them.
[time=2473] If that is true, the coming event of our Lord's return has cast shadows everywhere you look today.
[time=2479] We can look at the map and at the newspapers and see the regathering of Israel to its homeland.
[time=2484] We can watch in the newspapers and listen to the reports of the rise of Russia and her continuing allies with the Arab nations.
[time=2492] We can look around us religiously and see the atheistic ideology that's developing on every front
[time=2498] and the apostasy within the organized church and ecumenism which is developing globally.
[time=2505] Science and technology is advancing faster than we can keep track of it.
[time=2510] Nuclear power is on every side.
[time=2512] The rebirth of China is very present in our knowledge and information.
[time=2517] The general lawlessness and worldwide organized crime tells us according to the word of God that the Lord's return is soon.
[time=2525] And we do well to follow the instruction found in the 12th chapter or the 24th chapter of the Book of Matthew
[time=2532] where we are told watch for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh.
[time=2538] Men and women, God has called us in our generation and in our day to be watching what's going on around us
[time=2545] so that we can be aware of the time in which we live.
[time=2548] Far too many Christians bury their heads in the sand and though it is important to read their Bibles they never read anything else to find out how their Bible touches the life in which they live.
[time=2558] God has called us to be vigilant in our watch.
[time=2561] But notice secondly in this passage of Scripture that God has called us to be valiant in our warfare.
[time=2567] In verse 12 we read the night as far spent the day at his hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness
[time=2575] and let us put on the armor of light.
[time=2578] God has called us to watch and pray.
[time=2582] When we watch we sight the enemy.
[time=2585] When we pray we fight the enemy and God wants us to be involved in both of those activities.
[time=2591] The armor of the Lord which has been given to us is an order that we might be involved in the battle.
[time=2597] And notice that the battle here takes on two instructions.
[time=2601] First that we are to cast off something and second that were to put on something.
[time=2605] It says were to cast off the works of darkness and were to put on the armor of light.
[time=2611] Now when we cast off the works of darkness we take off the suit of clothes that pictures the old life that we had before becoming Christians.
[time=2620] And we put on the armor of light which is godly works which Christ expects of everyone who names his name.
[time=2627] Think with me for a moment in your imagination of a young man going into the army.
[time=2631] And when he is responsible to stand in report for the first time having been issued all of the paraphernalia for his warfare
[time=2640] among all of the recruits who are dressed properly he stands in line dressed in a sport coat and khaki pants with an open collar.
[time=2647] The sergeant comes along to look at him and he says young man you are not properly outfitted for the war.
[time=2653] You cannot be in this army if you don't dress like the rest.
[time=2656] There's a certain kind of a dress that's expected of those of you who serve and who fight.
[time=2661] He said well I understand that but this is the way I've always dressed.
[time=2664] This is the way I like to dress. This is what I'm used to what I'm accustomed to and if it's alright with you I'd like to be in your army sir but I'd like to dress like I'd like to dress.
[time=2673] You and I both know that it would not be long before that man would be in the brig.
[time=2677] And probably if he maintained his obstinates it would not be long before he would be back home under court martial.
[time=2683] And yet let me tell you that far too many Christians who say they have joined the army of the Lord have refused to put off all of the outward and inward clothing of darkness which exemplified their former lifestyle.
[time=2696] They're anxious to be in the army but they want to dress up and do all the things that they did before.
[time=2701] They want all of those characteristics of their old life with which they have become very comfortable to be a part of their new life.
[time=2708] And Paul warns us that in these closing days men and women it's time for us to be valiant in our warfare.
[time=2714] We need to put off the works of darkness and get out of sin in our lives and we need to put on the armor of light.
[time=2720] For if we do not this dark world which is fastest integrating has no source of light to which they may look.
[time=2728] We must be vigilant in our watch.
[time=2732] We must be valiant in our warfare.
[time=2736] May I encourage you thirdly that we must be virtuous in our walk.
[time=2740] Notice in verse 13 he says let us walk how honestly as in the day not in reveling in drunkenness not in immorality and wantness not in strife and envy.
[time=2753] Men and women as the world disintegrates around us we must maintain a contrasting lifestyle of purity and holiness or the world has no counterpart to which they may look for hope.
[time=2767] As I have had opportunity in these past weeks to be in other churches and to talk with other men who are in the ministry ministries much like ours.
[time=2775] The one consistent cry that comes from each of them and it's the cry of my own heart that among God's people there is far too much of worldly living that does not exemplify the spirit of holiness and virtuosity which God here demands from all of us.
[time=2794] Notice that he puts his finger on three areas of our lives.
[time=2798] He says that we are to walk honestly not reveling nor in drunkenness that's public sins.
[time=2804] He says we are to walk without immorality and wantness that's private sin and we are to walk without strife and jealousy that's personal sin.
[time=2814] And Paul writing to the Romans says in this day when the time is short when the Lord's return is near it is vitally important that your walk be a walk of honesty and a walk of cleanness and a walk of purity.
[time=2827] That's why we have the instruction in Hebrews 10 that as we see the day of the Lord approaching we are to spend more and more time with God's people in God's word not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.
[time=2840] There he is as we learned on our staff retreat this past weekend a tremendous tug at each one of us as Christians as the world rapidly runs head log into sin and degradation.
[time=2853] Whether we like it or not we're standing in the midst of it and it has a pull on it as if we're not careful and if we don't have a deep commitment to the word of God it will not be long before the word the world begins to erode our Christian living.
[time=2866] Stop for just a moment Christian and ask yourself this question which is sobering to all of us what things are there in my life today as a Christian that five years ago I would never have condoned but because the culture has changed I have become insensitive
[time=2881] to it and now it is very much a part of my life.
[time=2884] And if that happens in this five years it will happen in the next five years and the five years after that and pretty soon there'll be no difference between us and the world in which we live.
[time=2893] No wonder Paul called the Romans to a walk that was virtuous.
[time=2898] In this day which is decadent men and women we need a watch which is vigilant we need a warfare which is valiant we need a walk which is virtuous but in our day and in our age we need to be waiting victoriously.
[time=2918] Notice that he says at the end of this text put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lust.
[time=2927] You say Pastor Dave in light of all that you've said about our time and our day and our generation and the kind of philosophy in society which is ours is it possible for a Christian to live the victorious life.
[time=2940] Absolutely. Absolutely. I believe that God has given to us all that we need to know in this book to make us victorious in this generation but you say you don't know how the other Christians I fellowship with live.
[time=2953] I don't care about that I just know what the book says.
[time=2956] The book says that we're to live victoriously and it gives us two clues to that victorious waiting for the Lord's return in this text.
[time=2964] First of all it says we're to put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2969] Now oftentimes when we read this scripture we only read the last part which says make no provision for the flesh and that's a great principle we'll touch on in a moment.
[time=2978] But may I say to you the way that you make no provision for the flesh is by putting on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2985] The way you overcome evil is with good and throughout the scripture we're told continually that there are things which we are to do as Christians to bring the Christian life to the top in our experience and make us what we ought to be as victorious servants of the Lord.
[time=3000] We are told over and over again certain things that we're to put on we're to put on Christ in chapter 13 verse 14 we're told in Ephesians 4 24 we're to put on the new man.
[time=3011] We're told over in Colossians 3 12 we're to put on Christ likeness.
[time=3016] We're told in Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 that we are to be clothed with the Holy Spirit.
[time=3023] We're told in the same chapter that we're studying verse 12 we're to put on the armor of light.
[time=3032] We're told in Ephesians chapter 6 we're to put on the whole armor of God and bless God we're told that someday we're going to put on immortality and we're going to live forever.
[time=3042] I'm afraid that many Christians have become passive in their struggle and they're very concerned about making no provision for the flesh all the things they don't do all the places they don't go all the people they don't associate with.
[time=3055] And that's very important the Bible has much to say about that but men and women we don't have victory in our Christian lives by the things that we refuse to do or the places we don't go.
[time=3065] We have victory in our Christian lives when we take this word at face value and we put on the Lord Jesus Christ we walk into every day clothed with Christ in our lives and he is the positive influence within us that gives us victory.
[time=3080] Paul goes on to warn us that as we put on the Lord Jesus Christ we're not to make provision for the flesh.
[time=3087] What does that mean? That means men and women that it's time for us to quit playing games with the enemy.
[time=3095] I always am interested when people come to me and say pastor is it all right for a Christian to do this?
[time=3102] Is it all right for a Christian to go here?
[time=3105] I always have this feeling when they ask me that question that they're not interested in being out and out Christian they want to be a Christian they'd like to live just as close to the edge of the world as they can and they want to know if it's legitimate.
[time=3116] And if it is going to do it even though it may have a bad influence on their life.
[time=3120] The Bible says men and women that in this generation which is decaying you and I need to be looking out at the influences around us and saying if going to that place is going to have a bad influence on me and make provision for my flesh to grow to feed my old sinful nature then I'll not go there.
[time=3139] If involving myself in this activity will not feed the spirit in my life but the flesh in my life then I will x that out of my schedule because I will not make any provision for the flesh that it might have victory in my life.
[time=3156] So many Christians today living so close to the edge so many young people who do not take seriously the injunction to flee youthful lusts who try to be Christian in name but live like the rest of the world.
[time=3175] Paul says that in this day when all of the world seems to be rapidly decaying we need to wait victoriously living our lives day by day victoriously in this world.
[time=3191] Jesus is coming back I fully believe that he'll come back before we have another 10 year anniversary maybe our next anniversary celebration will be up in glory.
[time=3202] In light of the soon return of Christ how holy our lives ought to be what kind of living ought to be ours day by day.
[time=3213] Two years ago my wife and I and some other members of this church had the privilege of traveling to the holy land visiting the land of our Lord.
[time=3223] Many experiences impressed me in that journey.
[time=3226] I remember the day when our bus went to Mount Zion and we disembarked looked at many of the monuments that had been placed there according to tradition Mount Zion is the place where the tomb of David is.
[time=3243] According to tradition this is the place where the upper room was but there was another monument on that mountain which impressed me with a great sense of all.
[time=3257] It was not according to tradition it was a monument in a museum that had been constructed during our lifetime.
[time=3266] It was the display of horrors that took place during the Nazi communist persecution it was a museum a monument to those who died at the hands of wicked men.
[time=3284] We walked through that museum and scarcely could do it without tears coming to our eyes as we saw on every hand the evidence of death, torture, inhumanness, the exhibits.
[time=3297] I saw one copy of the mosaic law that was bathed in blood and according to the story a rabbi had been slain in the synagogue while he was teaching the law.
[time=3308] There were places where the ashes of people who had been burned after they had been gassed in the gas chamber were collected.
[time=3316] The most awful and horrible sight that I saw in that occasion was one exhibit where they had a glass of soap and according to the record the soap had been made out of human fat that had been extracted from the Jews who had been annihilated and killed.
[time=3336] When I got back home and looked at the literature that had been given us there I found something that I had not seen.
[time=3342] Next to that awful display of horror and torture written in large Hebrew letters and translated in the brochure was a little triangular plaque that pointed upward and written inside of that plaque were these words.
[time=3357] Of all the truth this is the truth that we most believe Messiah is coming soon despite the fact that he did not come today despite any other facts in life.
[time=3372] This is the truth that we believe Messiah is coming soon and I am told that that was a prayer that the Jews memorized which they prayed when they were about to be killed.
[time=3386] And men and women in the generation which is dying around us that is the prayer God has given to us.
[time=3393] Of all the truth this is the truth that we know best Messiah is coming he's coming soon and how should we be living as we wait for his return shall we pray.
