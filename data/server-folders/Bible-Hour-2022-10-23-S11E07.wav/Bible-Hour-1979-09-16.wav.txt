[time=54] [ Singing ]

[time=93] God has evidently already blessed, we're grateful for His encouragement and the extension of our ministries to reach more people, we're grateful for all of you who are present, we would take this opportunity to invite all of you who watch by television, who haven't come because of the crowded condition, to understand that we have made room for you, so that you can share with us in our morning service, and we encourage you to come.
[time=118] We're grateful for the ministry of music in our church, our special guest today, we'll be hearing from them in just a few moments, the life-action singers.
[time=126] Right now, please listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Don Kruger, as they sing for us a song entitled "Praigee the Lord." [MUSIC - "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord,"
[time=150] "Praigee the King of Creation."
[time=159] Oh, my soul prays here, for He is my health and salvation.
[time=168] For He will hear, come to His temple for me.
[time=177] Join me in love and all creation.
[time=189] [MUSIC - "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord,"
[time=252] "Praigee the Lord, O Lord, that is in me, O Lord, me."
[time=263] All that has light and bread come now with praise as we pour in.

[time=302] "Praigee the Lord."
[time=310] Thank you, Choir.
[time=317] One of the blessings of double services, I get to hear all the good music twice, and it's good, and I appreciate it.
[time=323] How many of you can remember back several years to the life-action crusade?
[time=327] Let me see your hands.
[time=329] How many of you old timers remember that?
[time=332] And then the life-action team was with us in 1976 in the Thanksgiving season, and we videotaped a Thanksgiving special, and they shared that with us.
[time=341] It was a great time of fellowship and enjoyment.
[time=344] We're glad to have these young people back with us on this special day, and I know that you'll be blessed and encouraged as you listen to their ministry in music right now.
[time=359] [MUSIC - "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord," "Praigee the Lord."]
[time=380] There's a sweet and blessed story of the Christ who came from glory just to rescue me
[time=387] from sin and misery.
[time=390] The loving hand is swept me, and from sin and shame, he bought me the new Jesus' ransom to me.
[time=400] Hallelujah!
[time=405] Lift him from the mighty clay and save him free.
[time=410] I will ever tell this story shouting Glory, Glory, Glory!
[time=418] Hallelujah!
[time=420] Jesus' ransom to me.
[time=424] From the throne of heavenly glory, O this sweet and blessed story, Jesus came to live to the last one, sin, and all.
[time=434] In to liberty, O glorious trophies of His grace, victorious Adam,
[time=440] are rejoicing here below.
[time=444] Thy environment join in creasing, and with gratitude and ceasing, they bid up with pride to forevermore to be.
[time=454] I will join the Lord, singing in the anthem ever again.
[time=462] Hallelujah!
[time=474] Lift him from the mighty clay and save him free.
[time=477] I will ever tell this story shouting Glory, Glory, Glory!
[time=486] Hallelujah!
[time=490] Jesus' ransom to me.
[time=495] Hallelujah!
[time=497] We've answered me!
[time=504] We thank you so much for joining us on the Bible Hour today,
[time=511] and while we're receiving the offering here in the Convocation Center, we want to take just a moment to share with you some things that we know will be of vital interest to those of you who are watching us at home.
[time=521] First of all, we want to remind you again that our special gift offer during these past days has been a very unique little book called The Answer Book.
[time=529] It's a book of Scripture references and written out verses topically arranged so that you just opened the book to the subject you're looking for, and on each page there are a number of verses that relate to that particular subject.
[time=543] We've had such a tremendous response to this little answer book.
[time=546] In fact, one of the men in the Bible Hour office told me this week that it is the most asked for Bible Hour gift that we've ever offered.
[time=555] And we got a very special and unique letter in relationship to The Answer Book this week.
[time=560] Donna, why don't you share that with our friends?
[time=563] This letter comes from Chicago, and she writes, "Dear Pastor Jeremiah, I really enjoy your program on Channel 38.
[time=572] I'm blind, so I'm glad that you always say your address.
[time=576] I would like The Answer Book.
[time=578] I'm going to put some of it in Braille and share it in our Braille track ministry.
[time=583] And I think everyone in the office really got a thrill when they heard about this gal's desire to share Christ and help them find answers from the Bible through the Braille ministry.
[time=594] And it reminded me again of how the Bible Hour touches so many people.
[time=598] We think of it as a visual ministry, but honey, there are people who listen to the Bible Hour on television who can't enjoy it visually, and we have a ministry to them as well.
[time=608] We're so grateful for the people that we've been able to help through the Bible Hour, and we're also very grateful for the people who are helping us.
[time=615] And as many of you know, during these past weeks, we've been honoring some folks as sponsors and associate sponsors of the Bible Hour.
[time=622] These are people who either underwrite the entire cost of one station each week or as associate sponsors, they give a gift of $100 toward the ministry of the Bible Hour in their area.
[time=633] Donna, you have some associate sponsors to share with us this morning.
[time=637] We have several this morning.
[time=639] We have three from Fort Wayne who are co-sponsoring the Bible Hour in this area, Mr. Glenn Fisher and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Welch.
[time=648] And they are also members of our Founders Club, so we say an extra special word of thank you to them.
[time=654] And then watching on Channel 38 is Mrs. Margaret Waltz.
[time=658] And she also is a member of our Founders Club, and we certainly want to say to you how much we appreciate your involvement in sponsoring the Bible Hour.
[time=668] We do appreciate all of the folks who stand behind us in the ministry of the Bible Hour, and though we don't have all of the exact information to share with you today, in the next broadcast or so, we're going to be telling you about some exciting banquets that will be coming to your area in the near future during the month of November.
[time=688] We'll be coming to almost every area where the Bible Hour is seen with a very exciting banquet to update you on the ministry of the Bible Hour, and we'll give you that information in these next few weeks as you continue to join with us in the ministry here on the Bible Hour television program.
[time=703] I want to ask you to join Donna and myself and many of the members of our church and Christians all over the country who are part of this ministry in beginning the month of October by reading the Bible through.
[time=717] This very special read the Bible through booklet called "The Daily Walk" is now being produced through the Bible Hour office, specifically designed for our Bible Hour friends.
[time=728] And Donna and I would like to send you a free copy of the October issue that begins with the Book of Matthew, and we'll be happy to do that this week if you'll write to us.
[time=737] This free issue of "The Daily Walk" produced by the Bible Hour office will come to you free and postage paid when you write to us this week.
[time=746] It is a sample edition, and when we send it to you, we'll let you know how you can get this every month.
[time=752] They have shared with us, as we have studied this program together, that by spending 20 minutes a day, you can read the entire Bible in one year.
[time=760] Many of you have done that in the past, but this little booklet makes it even more exciting because there are explanatory helps.
[time=767] There's information about all of the sections of the Bible, some exciting diagrams to make reading the Bible through very, very exciting.
[time=775] In the inside of the booklet, there's a checklist that you can use as a bookmark to put in your Bible, and you can check off that you've read your assignment each day.
[time=783] When you're finished, you send that into our office, and we keep track of it.
[time=787] At the end of the year, we'll be sending a very attractive certificate to all of those who have joined with us and successfully read the scriptures through in the course of a year.
[time=797] I want to remind you that this sample booklet is available to you free and postage paid if you will write to us this week.
[time=804] We'll send you this one edition and then give you information as to how you can receive each month the daily walk from the Bible, our television ministry.
[time=813] Now, when you write to us and request the daily walk, the read through the Bible booklet, or this answer book, which gives you all of the scripture verses topically, or when you write to us and request information about the associate sponsor program, there's a very important address that you need to remember.
[time=833] You need to write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we'd like for you to share with us on what channel you view the Bible Hour.
[time=848] That mailing address again is post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=856] Thank you so much for joining us today.
[time=858] I know you're appreciating the ministry of the life action singers, and they're going to be back to sing for us again in just a moment.
[time=864] And then I'm going to be speaking to you from the book of 1 Timothy on what kind of church God wants in his world today.
[time=871] I trust that you'll be with us for the entire hour as we share together.
[time=874] Let's share together this edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=878] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=904] [APPLAUSE - 8 seconds]
[time=916] Thank you, life action singers, for that thrilling, thrilling ministry.
[time=920] They'll be back in just a minute to sing for us. Again, let's turn in our hymnals to hymn number 661, and we'll sing the song, "Lord, we speak in living echoes of thy love." Shall we all stand together as we sing this?
[time=936] Everyone together?
[time=938] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=990] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=996] Just before the life action singers come to minister to us again, let me remind you of a couple of other announcements. In just a few days, many of you will be receiving in the mail a special booklet that will help you to join my wife and I and other Christians in this community in reading through the scriptures during the next 12 months. This booklet will replace the Bible study guides that we produced in our office for over the last 15 months and it is an exciting way for you to master the content of the Word of God.
[time=1028] We would like for you to begin reading in the book of Matthew with us on the 1st of October. For those of you who are watching by television at home, we'll be happy to send them to you if you'll just write and let us know and we'll be happy to have everyone involved in studying the scripture and reading it through during the next 12 months. That can be an exciting thing.
[time=1048] They tell me that if you spend 20 minutes a day, you can read the entire Bible in one year. I know there are many of you that still have that exciting accomplishment ahead of you and I would encourage you to join with us if you don't receive your copy of the Bible study guide, please see someone in the office will be happy to see that you get one. We're very happy for what God is doing in our school. We've gotten off to the best year yet in the Black Hawk Christian School. We thank God for all of you who have prayed with us for all of the new faculty members that God has brought to us and we want you all to know that we still have some openings in the upper level in the high school and if you know of young people who are interested in Christian education, you please let us know because we'd be happy to have them and encourage them in this whole matter of getting a good education from a biblical foundation.
[time=1096] Now we're going to listen again to the life action singers as they minister to us.
[time=1118] [MUSIC - 254 seconds]
[time=1376] And I hope that you'll all be prepared to reach out in a special way and let them know that you appreciate their ministry. Thank you kids for your singing.
[time=1384] Let's take our Bibles now and turn to the book of 1 Timothy and the 4th chapter, 1 Timothy chapter 4.
[time=1392] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=1404] 4th chapter of Paul's letter to Timothy, part of the pastoral epistles, and we're reading beginning at the first verse.
[time=1412] 1 Timothy chapter 4.
[time=1414] Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
[time=1420] giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to Mary and commanding to abstain from foods which God had created to be received with thanksgiving by them who believe and know the truth.
[time=1438] For every creature of God is good and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving,
[time=1444] for it is sanctified by the word of God in prayer.
[time=1448] If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine unto which thou hast attained, but refused profane and old wives fables and exercised thyself rather unto godliness,
[time=1464] for bodily exercise profitth little, but godliness is profitable unto all things,
[time=1470] having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
[time=1474] This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living God who is the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe.
[time=1488] Shall we pray together?
[time=1490] Our God in heaven we thank you for this passage of Scripture.
[time=1494] It is as fresh and new and up to date as if it were written yesterday.
[time=1500] It describes our generation.
[time=1504] It describes the time in which we live, but it not only gives us the context of our life, it gives us concrete information as to how we are to live.
[time=1515] Lord, we come this morning with expectant hearts and open minds to receive the truth that you would communicate to us by thy spirit through thy word.
[time=1525] Open our hearts, make us receptive hearers, and willing doers of the truth.
[time=1531] For we pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1535] Not too long ago, I read a description of our generation.
[time=1543] It goes as follows.
[time=1545] We are aboard a train which is gathering speed, racing down a track with an unknown number of switches leading to unknown destinations.
[time=1557] No single scientist is in the engine cab and there may be demons at the switches.
[time=1563] Most of society is in the caboose looking backward.
[time=1569] That describes very aptly the generation in which we live.
[time=1574] Not too long ago, I heard the story of a pilot of mid-air airlines who announced to his passengers.
[time=1581] He said, "I have some good news and some bad news, ladies and gentlemen."
[time=1587] The bad news is that we have lost our instrumentation and we have no idea where we're going.
[time=1593] The good news is we have picked up a tailwind and we're making good time.
[time=1598] That seems to describe the way we are in our generation.
[time=1603] We seem not to know where we're going, but we're going faster than we ever have before.
[time=1608] And we're clocking ourselves and talking about how wonderful it is to be traveling at such speed, but we are like the generation in the caboose looking backward, not knowing where we're going.
[time=1622] I am certain that it was something like this that Paul had in mind when he wrote to young Timothy who lived at a similar time.
[time=1629] In fact, if I understand the Scripture right, Paul was reminding Timothy that he lived in a time very familiar and very similar to the last times.
[time=1639] He says in the first verse, "The Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times." And I believe that that phrase is a reference to the time just prior to the coming of Christ or the day of Christ.
[time=1651] I personally believe that it is a reference to the day in which we live today.
[time=1656] I believe that these phrases which describe the generation are phrases which describe our generation.
[time=1665] Paul said six very pointed things to young Timothy about those days.
[time=1670] He lived in the city where he bore testimony for Christ in the foreshadowing of these things
[time=1677] which we're experiencing in our lifetime, and Paul wrote to young Timothy some very important words,
[time=1684] not only words to describe his generation, but words to give him instruction as to how he should live.
[time=1691] Last week we discussed together the things that he said in the Book of Romans.
[time=1696] Today we see again his analysis of our time and his instruction to us as believers.
[time=1703] Six things he says about this generation and every one of the phrases are important.
[time=1708] First of all, he says it will be a generation of defection.
[time=1712] He says in the latter times, "Some shall depart from the faith." That is a term which usually is referred to as the great apostasy or the walking away from the truth.
[time=1724] We're seeing that happen in our time and in our age.
[time=1728] Churches that once taught the word of God departing from the truth, and men and women who once went to churches that taught the word of God departing from their churches.
[time=1737] There is a great apostasy, a great defection among us in our generation.
[time=1743] All we have to do is look at the attendance figures of all of the mainline denominations and even some that bear an evangelical testimony are reporting less numbers than the years before in terms of attendance and growth.
[time=1757] There is a great defection ecclesiastically which is taking place in our time.
[time=1762] But notice in the next phrase, he says it will be a time of delusion.
[time=1767] Now the spirits speaketh expressly that in the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.
[time=1776] Seducing spirits.
[time=1778] The east has taken over our culture.
[time=1781] They have come in with all of their religious ideas and they are trying to convert us to some sort of esoteric philosophy of life.
[time=1789] Some sort of vague reality of God and some sort of concept of reality which is very unreal.
[time=1797] Not too long ago, one of the scholars who has interpreted our times wrote the following words.
[time=1803] He said biblical Christianity is not an esoteric religion.
[time=1807] It's content is not concealed in vague symbols requiring some sort of special insight to grasp.
[time=1815] There is no special intellectual prowess or pneumatic gift which you must have to understand the Bible.
[time=1822] You may find that in the eastern religions where insight is limited to some remote guru who lives in a shanty high in the Himalayas that special insight is needed.
[time=1832] If you study the word of God, you have the spirit of God to give you understanding.
[time=1837] Maybe the guru has been thunderstruck by the gods with some profound mystery of the universe.
[time=1843] You travel to inquire and he tells you in a hushed whisper that the meaning of life is one hand clapping.
[time=1851] Now that's esoteric.
[time=1853] That's so esoteric that even the guru doesn't understand it.
[time=1857] We can't understand it because it's an absurdity.
[time=1861] Absurdities often sound profound because they're incapable of being understood.
[time=1866] Sometimes what we think is deep is nothing but dumb.
[time=1874] We're living in a day when people are being deluded with the esoteric philosophy of Christianity and of life
[time=1880] where deceiving spirits are at work.
[time=1883] Look around our country and you will find special places that have been set up for the purpose of deprogramming people from the brainwashing that takes place in the deluding, deceiving generation in which we live.
[time=1897] Paul goes on to write to young Timothy that not only will it be a time of defection and a time of delusion
[time=1903] but it will be a time of demon activity, a time of demonic prowess.
[time=1911] Some of us have been put to sleep as it regards that subject.
[time=1915] You'll be interested to know that in England today there are some 30,000 registered practicing witches.
[time=1922] In the country of Germany there are over 10,000.
[time=1925] When we read those statistics we say yes but that's the European culture.
[time=1930] Not too long ago I read with amazement a statistic that in the United States of America there are four million registered witches,
[time=1937] black, white witches, wizards.
[time=1940] There are schools in our country that teach witchcraft as a course to be studied.
[time=1946] Some experts have said that there are as many as 10 million witches practicing in the United States of America.
[time=1952] That is nothing more or less than the embodiment of demonic activity.
[time=1956] A witch by the name of Sibaleek who was a self-styled British witch says that in the last five years
[time=1964] witchcraft has increased in the world by 40%.
[time=1968] We're living in a time of demonic activity.
[time=1972] Not too long ago Dr. John Charles Cooper the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Eastern Kentucky University wrote these words.
[time=1978] He said there is such a thing as witchcraft.
[time=1981] It exists and it works.
[time=1983] I have seen the fear that it inspires in college students enrolled in large universities.
[time=1989] Fear that passes on to clinical paranoia in some instances and I have seen it work on white middle class people
[time=1997] in the heartland of the United States.
[time=1999] Witchcraft, demonic activity in almost every metropolitan city in our country today there is a place
[time=2005] if you know how to find it where you can go for the express purpose of worshipping Satan.
[time=2011] Paul wrote to Timothy in the latter days there would be an increase in demonic activity.
[time=2017] Notice fourthly that he said in these last days in the time in which we live today I personally believe it is a time of deliberate deceit.
[time=2026] There will be times according to verse two when men will be speaking lies in hypocrisy.
[time=2032] This means that they deliberately and purposefully and with knowledge and forethought sit down
[time=2039] and decide and determine how they can dupe the public.
[time=2043] Some of you were here a few weeks ago during our midweek service when the film was shown that described and chronicle the downfall of the Jones cult.
[time=2053] And you saw I am certain with amazement how that man deliberately deluded his people
[time=2059] and so gained control over them that when he told them to take their own lives they were powerless to resist.
[time=2066] Those who have written about the Jones tragedy tell us that though he may not have ever said it out loud
[time=2072] there is evidence to believe that he purposefully set out to delude and deceive those who would follow him.
[time=2078] The Bible says that in the end times there will be people walking around purposefully trying to deceive
[time=2084] and delude the public and sad to say there are many Christians who fall prey to such efforts on the part of Satan and his workers.
[time=2094] Paul continues to write to young Timothy and he says it will be a time when great demands will be put upon cults and unbelievers.
[time=2101] Notice that at the end of this passage of scripture where he is describing the culture he said that there will come a time when people
[time=2109] outside of the Christian faith will be saying that you must live according to a much more restrictive standard of living
[time=2116] forbidding to marry and denying certain kinds of food.
[time=2120] There was a time when the Christian populace had the highest standards of life and lifestyle any place in our culture
[time=2127] but sad to say while many Christians have lowered their standards the cults have come along and demanded much more of their people
[time=2134] and because of their high standards they have used that to gain control over the hearts and minds of individuals.
[time=2140] If you were to join a commune today you would have to live according to a certain set of standards which would demand certain things of you
[time=2148] which most Christians would not be willing to do even though they are very high and moral things. Certainly there are immoral things involved too
[time=2157] but there are cults and isms today which are demanding from their people certain restrictive things.
[time=2163] Paul said it would be so.
[time=2166] I want you to notice last but not least it would be a time of desensitized consciences.
[time=2173] He said it's a time when our consciences or their consciences will be seared with a hot iron.
[time=2180] That is a visual demonstration of what happens when you sear flesh and calluses develop upon it so that the flesh becomes insensitive.
[time=2190] Paul says in the last days the consciences of individuals will become so calloused and so seared that they will be insensitive
[time=2198] to the things that are going on around them. What is happening in the world is happening within the church.
[time=2205] One of the things that I talk with on occasion with returning missionaries is the culture shock they face when they walk back into our country.
[time=2213] They used to be culture shock the other way now they are telling me the culture shock is worse coming back home.
[time=2219] Not too long ago we were visiting with Dan and Judy Smith our missionaries to Akitos Peru and they said the worst thing they faced since going to the field was coming home.
[time=2229] Walking back into American culture trying to relate it to what they left and noticing that among Christians there is an insensitivity to the kind of thing that's happening in our world
[time=2240] so that they accept today what they never would have condoned years before.
[time=2245] Paul said Timothy you're living in such a time as this a time when there is a defection from the faith
[time=2253] a time when there is delusion rampant in the world a time of strong demonic activity
[time=2259] a time of deliberate deceit a time of demands upon unbelievers which require standards of them
[time=2265] higher than the standards which are required of Christians and a time of desensitized consciences among people.
[time=2274] I'm certainly glad he didn't stop there for had he stopped there we would have to stop here
[time=2281] and with the spirit of pessimism close our service and say what to do in such an hour as this
[time=2288] but I want you to notice that first of all he commended Timothy for expressing these truths to his people
[time=2295] he says in verse six if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ there oftentimes when we as pastors try to determine what God says to us about how we can be better ministers
[time=2310] how we can be good ministers of Jesus Christ Paul said to Timothy one of the requirements of a good minister of Jesus Christ is that he does not conceal the truth from his people but he tells it like it is what the word of God says about their time they need to understand and they need to know
[time=2327] Dr. Francis Schaeffer has said that the greatest mistake we may make during this generation
[time=2333] is not to prepare our people for that which is ahead of us in the culture of the future
[time=2339] Paul said Timothy if you want to be a good minister you make your people aware of the time in which they live you put them in remembrance of these things it isn't my favorite subject to stand up and talk about how bad it is most of you get that kind of news every day of your life and you come to church hoping that for one hour at least you'll hear some good news but I think in our attempt to be positive we need to keep that in balance with what God has to say about the time in which we live
[time=2364] there is good news but that good news needs to be understood within the context of our culture and of our generation
[time=2372] had Paul been living today he could not have more aptly described what we face every day of the week
[time=2378] than what he described in these first few verses but the interesting thing is he doesn't stop there he tells us that there is something we need to know
[time=2387] something we need to do a certain kind of lifestyle that we need to adopt if we're to face this world
[time=2393] and all of the attacks upon the Christian faith which come upon us
[time=2399] and though these words were addressed to a young minister who was trying to pastor a church
[time=2405] and though in a sense I take them more personally perhaps than you will I want you to understand that the principles are universal as far as Christianity is concerned and the things he said to young Timothy saying to you and to you and to all of you he's saying Timothy here's how to live in such a world first of all he said the demand of this world upon you as a minister is the demand of an expositional ministry
[time=2431] you must have a ministry of exposition notice in verse 7 in verse 6 he says if you put the brethren in remembrance of these things
[time=2438] now shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine
[time=2444] unto which thou hast attained notice nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine
[time=2450] Paul said Timothy because of the time in which you minister it is important it is imperative
[time=2457] that your ministry be a ministry of the exposition of the word of God I say that because the temptation when you see all of these fast changes taking place
[time=2470] is to divert your attention to the changing culture and away from the word of God
[time=2476] to feel as if perhaps God has called you to give the country a facelift instead of ministering God's truth
[time=2484] Paul said Timothy your calling is a calling of the words of faith and the doctrine which people need to know
[time=2491] one of the reasons so many Christians are caught up in the cults and isms today is because they're untaught they don't know what the book has to say and as soon as air comes along it sounds exciting it sounds relevant
[time=2502] it sounds new it sounds thrilling and they run off after it because they have no anchor in the word of truth
[time=2509] Paul said Timothy you have a ministry of exposition you teach the word notice words of faith good doctrine nourished up that means every day consistent regular teaching
[time=2522] he talks about the regular teaching he talks about the right kind of foods he says that your teaching
[time=2528] can't be bright brief brotherly talks or short sweet sisterly tales it needs to be exposition from the word of God
[time=2535] teaching of truth faith comes by hearing I read I ran into a woman not too long ago was telling me about her study
[time=2545] habits she said pastor I don't I don't like doctrine she's I just like I just like to love Jesus she's I just like to know Jesus and just love him I don't like doctrine that sounds good at first blush but let me tell you something
[time=2557] as soon as somebody says I love Jesus and you ask them who is Jesus if they don't only doctrine they're dead
[time=2564] because as soon as you define Jesus you've started doctrine men and women we need doctrine in our churches
[time=2571] we need doctrine in our hearts and in our lives it's not enough just to love Jesus as important as that is we need to be taught the word of God
[time=2579] and Paul said to Timothy you'll not survive in your culture if you don't have the inculcation of God's word through a consistent
[time=2587] expositional ministry by God's grace that's what this church will have because that's what's going to make the difference
[time=2594] in the lives of people it may not be as exciting and thrilling and sensational but it will be that which God will honor to see us through
[time=2601] the storm in the days ahead notice secondly he called him not only to a word of exposition and a ministry of exposition
[time=2610] but he called him to a ministry of exercise now don't picture in your mind Timothy doing jumping jacks that's not what he's talking about
[time=2618] although I think that's quite important but notice that he says for bodily exercise profit of little verse eight
[time=2625] but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come notice the reason he said that was because of the instruction in verse
[time=2635] seven that he gave to Timothy exercise thyself unto godliness a ministry of exercise now the word exercise in verse seven is a very favorite
[time=2646] term of all of us who have athletic concerns it's the word from which we get the word gymnasium and Paul is saying to Timothy
[time=2654] you need to rigorously exercise your life in such a way that it is comparable to the rigorous exercise of an athlete in the gymnasium
[time=2664] your life needs to be characterized by discipline it needs to be put together in a certain way so that it has structure and discipline
[time=2673] and you are a disciplined person what he was saying to Timothy was that there wasn't any get rich quick scheme
[time=2682] that if he was going to be the man of god in his generation that he was going to have to put in the time in the word and exercise himself
[time=2689] and the daily routine of the word of god Dr. Jay Adams has a book entitled discipline yourself for godliness sake
[time=2697] in the beginning of the book he says Brooks Robinson didn't become an all-star third baseman because one day he walked out the third base and decided that's where he was going to play
[time=2705] somebody told him one hand to put the glove on and they hit the first ball down to him and he discovered he had the natural flair of a third baseman
[time=2714] and Reggie Jackson didn't start powering home runs out of the ballpark because one day he picked up a piece of wood that looked very interesting to him
[time=2721] and when somebody threw a ball at him he hit it and found out that he had the knack to hit a baseball the reason that those athletes are what they are is because of the discipline and regular and systematic time that they put in in years past learning how to do what they do
[time=2737] now I'm not discounting natural ability but I'm saying there is no such thing as an athlete without discipline training
[time=2744] and we as Christians are always looking for the easy way this week I read a story of a new kind of bible study called lucky dipping you probably know about that
[time=2754] where you open the bible you pray for divine guidance and the page falls open and you put your finger on a word that's the term I heard lucky dipping
[time=2763] a lot of Christians I know follow the lucky dipping method of bible study and the story is told about a young girl who was experiencing the throes of senior panic because she hadn't found a husband yet
[time=2773] she had been praying diligently for a husband and someone told her about the lucky dipping method and so she tried it and she opened her bible up to Zechariah 9-9 which reads
[time=2785] rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout and triumph O daughter of Jerusalem behold your king is coming to you he is just an endowed with salvation humble and riding upon a donkey even on a coat the full of a donkey
[time=2800] and she reasoned in her mind that though that wasn't a white horse as the senior desperate she would take him on a donkey if he would come to her what a terrible way to try to find the will of God in our lives
[time=2812] a lot of Christians use the lucky dipping method of bible study because they won't exercise themselves for discipline some of you men in this church read the leadership letter that's printed by Bob Foster a good friend of this ministry
[time=2825] in the last issue of the leadership letter he made this statement it stuck out from the page he said life has many disasters and reversals but only one tragedy and that is to pass from infancy to senility without ever reaching maturity
[time=2842] a lot of Christians can have tragedy marked over their spiritual lives Paul said Timothy in your generation you better get busy and discipline yourself to be God's man that means regular daily routines for the sake of godliness
[time=2859] I want you to notice that his ministry was also to be a ministry of exclusion for everything positive there is something negative and Timothy was warned by Paul against certain things that could creep into his life and into the ministry
[time=2877] for which he was responsible notice in verse 7 he says but refuse reject exclude profane and old wives fables he's saying Timothy don't you get caught up in the fad syndrome of your day with everyone coming along with some new answer
[time=2899] to the spiritual problems that we face and there are more spiritual quacks per square inch in our world today than there ever have been before
[time=2911] you listen to the medias and you'll discover everyone's got some new thing I read last week where it's now possible lay hands on your gas tank and God will put gas in the tank
[time=2928] I know someone will write to me and say you're making fun of spiritual things no I'm not I'm making fun of things that aren't spiritual
[time=2938] that's a profane and old wives fable doesn't belong in the context of Christian faith God doesn't do that God can do things in his own way according to miracles but we've made play work out of it
[time=2950] we have we have made a far side of it we've made a joke out of it Paul said to Timothy Timothy you refuse all that stuff you stay away from that you stay in the milk and in the meat and in the discipline of the daily routine that God has set forth in his word
[time=2966] men and women we need that injunction as Christians today there's someone around every corner trying to get their hooks into you with some new scheme some new thing that isn't in this book
[time=2979] and you need to ask God to help you understand what it means to refuse the profane easy answers throughout the Bible there are many times when we're told that
[time=2990] 1 Peter 1 16 says we haven't followed cunningly devised fables Mark 5 24 tells us we're to take heed of what we hear and Mark and Luke 8 18 says we're to take heed of how we hear it
[time=3007] Titus 3 10 says a man that is in heretic after the first or second admonition reject 2 Timothy 3 23 says but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they breed strife
[time=3024] we're living in a day that is unparalleled by any other day in the history of our country when we have all kinds of weird philosophies of life running on every hand from the eastern cultural religions that have been imported
[time=3036] to the present crazy things that are happening as offshoots of Christianity to the cults and the isms and men and women if you don't have your spiritual thinking cap on and have a heart and a head full of God's doctrine you are prey for any one of those
[time=3051] and that's why Paul said to Timothy you have a ministry of exposition you be a godly man in terms of your own personal daily routine and you understand the importance of staying away from some things once in a while I hear about people in our church who can't stay away from the things that come to town you know it's almost like a religious circus
[time=3072] and they get so excited they go down there and they come back and they tell me how bad it was I don't think Christians ought to be doing that every time you walk in the door of some crazy outfit like that you open up your heart and let Satan have an opportunity to get at you
[time=3087] I'll tell you what I'm I stay away from was like the plague I don't need to give Satan any help he does quite all right by himself I would warn you and encourage you to a ministry of exclusion there isn't anything wrong with that
[time=3101] that's part of the positive life God has given us then I want you to notice fourthly and this may be the most important it touches every one of us he called him to a ministry of example
[time=3112] Timothy was a young man ministering in a very difficult situation all around him were these temptations and he was so young that some of the people didn't want to listen to what he had to say
[time=3122] some of them did like I have had done to me in years past not so recently where I have been among other pastors or other folks and we've been discussing things and they have at least outwardly patted me on the head and said now run a run along Sonny
[time=3136] when you grow up you'll be able to discuss things and I'm sure that Timothy felt that in the ministry there he was a young man and so Paul wrote to him and he said
[time=3143] Timothy don't let anyone despise your youth let me tell you what to do you be an example you live a life that is above reproach you be an example and he gave him six categories in which he was to be an example in which he was to live an exemplary life
[time=3161] he said Timothy you be an example in word in conduct in love in spirit in faith and in purity let your life be the answer to the critics when they see you let them see in you the embodiment of the Christian principles that you teach
[time=3181] notice that at the end of verse six he reminds Timothy that he is to be nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine and what's that last phrase on to which thou hast attained
[time=3192] Timothy these words this doctrine these are to be things that you've experienced in your own life you've attained those things already
[time=3200] don't be ministering out of a vacuum but teach out of a life of example to those around you and I want to say to you folks that there's never been a time when people are looking for reality like they're looking now
[time=3214] everywhere they look there's something phony something that has been manufactured to meet the test but Christians have the opportunity of expressing through their lifestyle and through their character and through their conduct and through their faith and through their love
[time=3228] that Jesus Christ works in our world today and he works in a life and he works in that life and in that life Paul said Timothy in the day in which you live that is encumbered by all of these things which I have warned
[time=3241] the real plea that I have for you is the plea for reality oh how we need that how I need that we must ask God never to let us be satisfied with anything that is not real in our lives
[time=3257] we must ask God to take his searchlight and search down into our hearts and into our motives and into our minds and into our ministries and put his finger upon anything that is phony and unreal
[time=3268] and we ought to bring that to the cross and ask him to take it from us and make us genuine people for our world the manufactured plaything world in which we live demands the reality of the Christian life
[time=3282] and God is calling us to a ministry of example we used to say it's not enough just to live the life you need to witness I understand that
[time=3292] so many Christians are among the silent majority they never open their mouths for Christ but I think maybe we need to reverse that now in this day and age and come back and say folks before you open your mouths
[time=3301] you better make sure your life is what it ought to be because I'm talking to people these days who say that the words they hear are being destroyed by the lives they watch
[time=3311] oh God help us to understand the ministry that God has called us to in our generation
[time=3318] God has so burdened my heart in these last days about these matters that I understand more than ever what Francis Schaeffer meant
[time=3325] and I believe that one of the things God is calling us to do is not to be alarmist but to understand our time and to ask God to help us be the kind of people he would want us to be in our generation
[time=3337] so that we can touch the lives of seeking men and women around us shall we pray
[time=3350] our heads bowed and our eyes closed we bring this service to a conclusion let me ask you first of all do you know Christ is your savior and if you don't would you know him
[time=3360] he would come into your life today to bring life and forgiveness and the reality of Christ within you
[time=3368] those of you who are watching by television right now wherever you are if you just bow your head confess your sin and invite Christ to come into your life he'll come in you don't have to be in church for that to happen he'll come in right where you are and become your savior confess your sin and invite him in and then let us know that you've done it so that we can help you and encourage you in your early days of growth
[time=3392] for those of you here in this auditorium with our heads bowed and our eyes closed as we've read from God's word what he has to say
