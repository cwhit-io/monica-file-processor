[time=16] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=26] [MUSIC]
[time=56] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=65] >> And it is our privilege to welcome all of you who have joined us here
[time=71] in the auditorium to the morning service.
[time=74] This is the second morning service that we've enjoyed together.
[time=77] We welcome all of you who have been in Sunday School the first hour and have now come to join in the worship of our Lord together.
[time=84] We're so grateful to extend the opportunity of worship beyond these walls through the means of television and now to many friends who have joined us by way of television in their homes.
[time=93] We trust this will be a great hour of encouragement and blessing in your life.
[time=97] Our own choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger begins our worship with a hymn of praise to the Lord.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=118] >> Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty we are Lord.
[time=138] Holy, Holy, we save our worship we are Lord.
[time=154] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=201] >> Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty we are Lord.
[time=226] Holy, Holy, we save our worship we are Lord.
[time=252] We adore thee, we adore thee.
[time=260] Praise and worship thee, praise and worship thee.
[time=270] [MUSIC]
[time=289] >> Thank you choir for lifting us in worship.
[time=292] Let's listen now to the ministry of Marilyn Wong.
[time=295] She's going to share with us a song about what it means to be born again.
[time=300] What it means to walk in fellowship with God in the new life that we have in him.
[time=304] I trust that her ministry will be a real blessing to you as you listen.
[time=318] To the flower in ground so dry, scorched by heat, it starts to die,
[time=332] till the clouds begin to rain and the flower blooms again.
[time=347] Like a bird with broken wing, once it had a song to sing,
[time=366] yet one day that bird will fly far away up in the sky,
[time=383] so our lives once came to be.
[time=390] We can think and we can see that beyond there's even more,
[time=406] if we'll just unload the door, there's a new world to be found,
[time=423] and a great life to abandon like the flower beneath the rain,
[time=438] so can we be born again, again.
[time=452] We're so grateful for your presence with us today on the Bible Hour,
[time=471] and this is a very special time of the year for all of us who are part of the Bible Hour staff.
[time=476] It is that time of the year when we begin to enroll new Founders Club members,
[time=482] and many of our folks, Donna, have already received a letter from my desk, letting them know about the tremendous opportunity of being involved in the Founders Club.
[time=490] I'd like for you to give a brief explanation to our friends at home about the Founders Club, what it means and what it does.
[time=497] The Founders Club is made up of folks who watch the Bible Hour and desire to have a part
[time=503] eventually for a minimum of $10 a month, which over the year actually is less than $2.50 a week,
[time=510] so we feel that everyone that watches the Bible Hour on a regular basis can join the Founders Club and have a part in keeping it on the air.
[time=519] It's exciting that it's not the people necessarily who are able to give the great amounts of money, although obviously on occasion those are a great encouragement, but it's the tremendous number of people who give on a regular basis, even $10 a month, $15 a month, some of them give $25 a month to the Founders Club, and that makes the Bible Hour possible.
[time=538] And I also have discovered that it makes those people much more excited about the Bible Hour because they're involved in it and they have a part in it.
[time=545] I mentioned to you this week that I had visited a lady who was a Founders Club member, and she told me one of the most exciting stories that I've heard in a long time, maybe you could just relate a bit of that, that's really thrilling to me.
[time=556] She shared that how she and her husband were watching the Bible Hour one Sunday and realized that they had never made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ, and they stopped right there in the middle of the program and asked Jesus Christ into their hearts, and now we're a member of God's family as well as the Founders Club.
[time=573] That's exciting, and I told her I only have to hear that about once a year, and it makes all the work that goes into this worthwhile.
[time=578] Down at the Founders Club not only is a one-way opportunity for people to give to us, but as they give to us, we return to them some very exciting things.
[time=586] First of all, this Bible reading schedule called The Daily Walk.
[time=589] I wish we had more time to talk about that this morning.
[time=592] We'll be talking about it more in the future.
[time=594] It is a plan to read through the Scripture in a year with a daily assignment and description of the passage every day.
[time=601] For instance, on the 15th of October, the reading in the Book of Mark, and it details the Scripture to be read and all of the information that will help them understand that passage of Scripture.
[time=611] We'll tell you in a moment how you can get your free copy of The Daily Walk as an introduction to the Founders Club.
[time=617] Then each month I send a letter to all of our Founders Club members with some inside information.
[time=622] There's a special little verse placard that gives them a verse for the month that they can sit on their desk to show them the verse on a regular basis, as well as many other things that we do for our special inside family.
[time=634] We want you to know that if you're interested in becoming a part of the Founders Club, we'd like to hear from you this week.
[time=640] Just write us a note and let us know that you'd like to become a part of the Inner Circle, the Founders Club of the Bible Hour.
[time=646] Today we have a guest with us at this particular portion of our service.
[time=649] He's Mr. Donald Warch, who is the President of the Baptist Children's Home in Valparaiso.
[time=655] And Don, you have been a friend of ours for a long time dating back to the beginning of the Jeremiah family in terms of children.
[time=662] Yes.
[time=663] We are indebted to you and your people for our first little girl, Jan.
[time=668] Do you remember those days, Donna?
[time=669] Sure do.
[time=670] I remember that long trip up to Valpo when they called and said she was there for us.
[time=675] Don, what is the Baptist Children's Home?
[time=678] The Baptist Children's Home was called into existence by churches.
[time=682] And we care for the fatherless children who need home.
[time=687] We have an adoption agency.
[time=690] We have foster homes.
[time=693] We have counseling.
[time=694] And for example, four children, a pastor just called here from the state of Indiana
[time=702] and said, "Pastor, Brother Warch, can you help?" The pastor said, "Four children.
[time=707] Their father is on his way to the penitentiary.
[time=710] The mother is in a mental hospital.
[time=714] And the children are with us." What's different about the Baptist Children's Home from the state welfare agencies and the other organizations that handle those kind of things, Don?
[time=724] Yes.
[time=725] We take the children from the pastor and the church and the families
[time=731] rather than the welfare department.
[time=734] The welfare department has their hands full.
[time=737] They're doing a good job in many areas.
[time=740] But we feel that we have a responsibility from God.
[time=743] He that does not provide for his own has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.
[time=750] And we believe that we people who love the Lord ought to care for our own.
[time=756] And of course, because the welfare agencies are controlled by the government, they don't have any opportunity for spiritual input.
[time=761] And that's one of the neat things that is so exciting when you send someone to the Baptist Children's Home in Valpo or if you have a young gal who's had some difficulties
[time=770] and she needs counseling and help, we know that when she goes there, she's not only going to get the kind of help she needs, but she's going to get that spiritual encouragement.
[time=779] And every time I'm with you, you tell me about someone you've had who came to Christ at the home.
[time=784] And that's got to be a thrill and excitement to all the people who are part of the ministry there.
[time=789] Don, you're here today because we have joined hands across the state to not only help the children's home but the Bible hour.
[time=797] And you are so encouraging to us because you shared with us just a few weeks ago
[time=803] that you have a mutual friend and some mutual friends who wanted to help the Bible hour and help the Baptist Children's home at the same time.
[time=810] And they came up with this ingenious plan of helping both of us together by sharing in the sponsors program of the Bible hour television program.
[time=820] And I don't think we've had anything quite like this before in all of our ministry.
[time=825] You know as well as I do that sometimes agencies and ministries don't always work together,
[time=831] but it's a real thrill for us to join hands with you on this Sunday, which is Baptist Children's home Sunday at this point in time on our telecast, and to say to you, thank you for being the sponsor of today's television program.
[time=845] And we have a very special plaque honey, why don't you give that to him?
[time=848] Just a reminder to you and all of your people and those friends who wanted to help us both together
[time=854] that the Baptist Children's home and the Bible hour television ministry stand for the truth and for the same things and we're just grateful for the opportunity of moving forward together.
[time=864] Thank you for what you've done to help us and God bless you as you work together at the Children's home ministry there.
[time=870] If you'd like to have information about the Baptist Children's home and what it can mean to you and what it can do for you, if you'll write to us at this address we'll be happy to pass on to you the information that you need.
[time=880] We'd also like to encourage those of you who are interested in joining the Founders Club to write to us this week.
[time=886] If you're interested in knowing more about the sponsors program, which has just been pictured here a few moments ago, we'd be happy to send you some information about that as well.
[time=895] Now the best address giver in all the world is my wife, so why don't you share with them how they can get in touch with us Donna?
[time=902] You just need to contact us by writing to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, 46815,
[time=912] that post office box number again is post office box 15250 Fort Wayne.
[time=919] And please be sure to write us this week and let us know of your interest and what God is doing here.
[time=924] We'll be happy to be of help to you in any way we can when we hear from you.
[time=928] I hope you'll stay with us now as we go to our morning message in just a few moments from the Book of Isaiah, one of the tremendous promises of the Old Testament.
[time=936] Have your Bibles ready and we'll be sharing the truth together in just a moment.
[time=963] [MUSIC]
[time=981] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=984] We're so grateful for the ministry God has given us to children,
[time=991] and it is our purpose as a church to so train up our children that they will follow in the footsteps of their godly parents who walk before them.
[time=999] That's true in every aspect of life.
[time=1002] We know that the secret to having a great choir like we have now in the future is to train our children to sing.
[time=1008] So we're really excited about having our junior choir here to sing for you in this service today.
[time=1013] Pastor Kruger works with them every week and they're going to sing a song now that he'll introduce and I know you'll enjoy their ministry.
[time=1021] Our young people are going to give you some tips, some secrets for happiness.
[time=1027] [MUSIC]
[time=1031] Walking with the saver on the narrow way, doing all the pieces from day to day, reading from the Bible taking time to pray.
[time=1042] Well that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1045] Trusting in the Lord and there's a stormy sky, giving him the devil's that would make us sigh.
[time=1052] Knowing he will keep us every need supplied.
[time=1056] Let's wait for happiness.
[time=1059] Ready with the witness to listen so true.
[time=1063] Giving out the gospel as he told us to.
[time=1066] Serving faithfully and always say or do.
[time=1070] Well that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1074] [MUSIC]
[time=1077] Doing all the pieces from day to day, living like a Christian in the neighborhood.
[time=1084] John Berry will let you know you're sure.
[time=1088] Well that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1091] Trusting in the Lord and there's a stormy sky, giving him the devil's that would make us sigh.
[time=1098] Knowing he will keep us every need supplied.
[time=1102] Well that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1105] Ready with his witness to his love so true.
[time=1109] Giving out the gospel like he told us to.
[time=1113] Serving faithfully and always say or do.
[time=1116] Well that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1120] Oh that's the way.
[time=1124] The only way.
[time=1127] Oh that's the way to find happiness.
[time=1135] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1142] Thank you children, that was great.
[time=1152] And we hope to be hearing more from them in the days ahead.
[time=1155] They're growing in their knowledge of music and their ability to share with us.
[time=1159] And we're so grateful.
[time=1161] Now we want to listen to the ministry of Mr. Ron Hackett.
[time=1164] As he comes to sing for us.
[time=1166] We're so blessed with musicians.
[time=1168] I told the folks in the early service that in that group we have some young Marilyn Wongs and star-narr Waltz and some young Ron Hackett's that God is raising up for the future generation.
[time=1178] But we're still glad for the old ones that are still around too.
[time=1181] [Laughter]
[time=1183] [MUSIC]
[time=1209] Lord, take control of me.
[time=1215] Reel my mind and let me see.
[time=1222] Let the fullness of your life and love is mine to share.
[time=1234] Make me a chair of your saving grace and cleansing love.
[time=1247] Make me a shelter for a brother in despair.
[time=1260] You may stay into the current of your spirit's power
[time=1271] and fill each moment of the day and every hour.
[time=1284] You may my life count for you and everything I say and do
[time=1297] help me ever tremendously, the fullness of your life.
[time=1310] [MUSIC]
[time=1322] Lord take complete control of my body, mind and soul.
[time=1335] Give me grace to trust you and surrender to your will.
[time=1348] Let me love a promise dressed when I face each trial and test.
[time=1361] So that you know my family faced a self to all of you.
[time=1375] Release me into the current of your spirit's power
[time=1387] and fill each moment of the day and be all you may my life count for you.
[time=1407] And every day I say and do, help me ever to pursue the fullness of your life.
[time=1429] Take my life and fill it with your eye.
[time=1445] [MUSIC]
[time=1465] Thank you Ron, that was a blessing. Amen.
[time=1470] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1478] Well you're finding your place there, let me take just a moment to introduce a series of messages that began today which I trust will be an encouragement to all of our people and all who hear the messages.
[time=1492] In a world that is filled with a great deal of bad news these days, you're reading the paper and you're watching the television, you're listening to the conversation in the different places where you are.
[time=1504] And I'd have to say that about 80% of what you hear isn't good, inflation, all kinds of problems.
[time=1511] And we as Christians claim to be the bearers of the gospel and the gospel is the good news about Jesus Christ.
[time=1519] I've been so concerned that Christians are being depressed with the circumstances that the world seems to let get them down, that I have decided it's time for us to emphasize some of the great promises of God from the Bible.
[time=1533] And I'm going to be preaching in these next weeks a series of messages on God's great promises for his people.
[time=1540] I want to share some good news, the Lord knows we need to have some good news in this day and age, so that's what I'm going to do.
[time=1548] And I'll be talking about some familiar passages and some that aren't so familiar, each of these promises has a particular setting into which it fits.
[time=1556] And today I want to talk to you about the good news for those who are hurting, the good news for those in difficulty, the good news for those with trouble.
[time=1566] Isaiah the prophet writes in the 43rd chapter, verses 1 through 3, "Why don't you join me, let's read it out loud together."
[time=1573] Isaiah 43, 1 through 3, "But now, thus saith the Lord who created thee, O Jacob, and he who formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.
[time=1592] When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
[time=1600] When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel, thy Savior.
[time=1614] I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Siba for thee."
[time=1621] Let us pray together. Father, we want so much for these words of this text to come alive into our hearts and into our lives.
[time=1629] And we would pray that you will, by the Holy Spirit, apply these truths to each one of us as we listen and share and study together.
[time=1638] We're mindful that though there are those here who are hurting, there are many who watch by television who are experiencing difficult times in their lives, loneliness and sorrow and tragedy and death.
[time=1649] And today, the Word of God would come to them as a bomb to heal their wounds and encourage and strengthen them where they are.
[time=1657] We pray to that end in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1662] Some time ago, I read a story about a fellow by the name of Pete. Pete was a golfer, an old time golfer, when the game first became popular here in this country.
[time=1674] And one day when he was out golfing, he had with him the only golf ball that he owned.
[time=1679] It was an old golf ball that had been beaten and battered through many days of hacking away.
[time=1685] He had that golf ball with him as he played with some other young men who also were playing the game but had more resources than he did, and they had brand new golf balls.
[time=1695] I learned something when I read this story that I had not known before, and that is that in the beginning of the game, the golf ball was a smooth, round ball with no indentations in it.
[time=1706] On that particular day, as they were golfing, Pete took his old beat up, indented, impacted golf ball, and as he teed off from the tee, it became obvious throughout the course of their playing that day that his golf ball went further and straighter than any of the others which were being used by the other golfers.
[time=1725] According to the record, that was the beginning of some studies that were done that demonstrated that a golf ball that has no indentations will not go as far, will not go as straight, nor as true as one that has been indented.
[time=1739] And so all of you duffers know when you go to buy a golf ball now, it's got little dimples all over the outside of it.
[time=1745] Those are there not just for design, they're there because in the wind resistance it makes the ball go better.
[time=1753] I was amazed as I read that story as I thought about that particular sport of how appropriate that is in terms of our own lives.
[time=1762] Most of us would like to have our lives fashioned after the smooth golf ball, no indentations, no impacts, no difficulties, no problems.
[time=1772] And yet God in his wisdom has chosen to let us be alive in a world which is filled with trouble and difficulty, and according to the scripture he has given us the opportunity of experiencing many of these problems.
[time=1785] In fact it is not a case of whether or not we will have difficulties, it's just a matter of when we will have them.
[time=1791] It is very interesting to note that one of the purposes that he has for these difficulties and these problems is in an order that through the indentations in our life and the impacts on our life and if you would the cracks in our souls.
[time=1804] He can keep us on target and get us going in the direction he wants us to go so that we get there on time and according to his plan.
[time=1813] That's why when we read the pages of the Word of God we discover that God has a lot to say about testing and trial and difficulty.
[time=1821] Now this passage which we have read this morning is obviously a passage which has its primary interpretation to the people of Israel.
[time=1829] It is addressed to Jacob and to Israel.
[time=1832] It was written some 700 years before Jesus Christ walked upon this earth.
[time=1837] And yet the applications of this Old Testament passage to Israel also come to us in our life and in our generation.
[time=1845] All of the terminology can be appropriated and applied to us as Christians.
[time=1850] That's why over and over again Christians today turn to this passage of scripture for comfort and encouragement.
[time=1856] Now in order for us to understand it we must go through it step by step and see all of the elements of the passage.
[time=1863] First of all I would like for you to notice the people to whom it is addressed.
[time=1868] The people to whom it is addressed. Notice verse 1 says, "Thou art mine."
[time=1875] The people to whom this promise is addressed are people who belong in a special way to the one who is the author of the passage, God Himself.
[time=1883] It is not written to the people of the world or the people outside of God's family.
[time=1888] It is written specifically to God's family.
[time=1891] That may be a point that we dare not pass over.
[time=1894] That God has something special for those who are of the family and those special things don't apply to those outside the family.
[time=1901] He has a special word for you and for me in the midst of our difficulties because we belong to Him.
[time=1907] God is addressing the people that belong to Him.
[time=1911] Now I want you to notice that in the passage they belong to Him for three reasons.
[time=1915] First of all they belong to Him because He created them.
[time=1919] Verse 1 says, "I have called thee by thy name, but I have formed thee and created thee."
[time=1926] We are God's first of all because He has created us.
[time=1931] The book of John tells us that there is not anything that has been made, that God has not made.
[time=1937] Genesis tells us that He formed man out of the dust of the ground and set into operation the reproduction cycle
[time=1944] so that we are a direct result of God's creative process in the world.
[time=1949] The God who controls the world and the circumstances of the world is the one who created Me.
[time=1955] And because He created Me, I am His. He made Me, I belong to Him.
[time=1960] Notice secondly that I am God's not only because He created Me, but I am His because He redeemed Me.
[time=1966] In this verse He says, "I have redeemed thee." Now I understand that this verse is a reference to the Lord's redemption of Israel out of Egypt.
[time=1976] Verse 3 makes it very clear that He is talking about the time when He brought Israel out of the Egyptian bondage
[time=1983] where they were for over 400 years and set them free.
[time=1987] We have studied that recently in one of our study sessions.
[time=1990] But it is also true that He has redeemed us.
[time=1994] And those of you who know about Old Testament typology and prophecy know that in understanding the Old Testament,
[time=2001] Egypt is a picture of our sinful bondage without Christ.
[time=2005] Just as God reached down into the land of Egypt and brought His redeemed people out of Egypt and out of bondage,
[time=2012] so He has reached down into this great world and He has extricated individuals out of the bondage of sin
[time=2019] and redeemed them and set them free.
[time=2022] So I am the Lord's not only because He has created Me, I am His because He has properly purchased Me
[time=2029] through His shed blood of His Son on Calvary and bought Me, and I belong to Him.
[time=2034] He has purchased Me. I am His.
[time=2037] But I want you to notice thirdly that I am His in a different way, not only because He created Me, not only because He redeemed Me, but the Scripture says I am also His because He has chosen Me.
[time=2049] Because He has elected Me.
[time=2052] The Scripture says I have called the by-the-name thou art mine.
[time=2059] We don't like to talk about election because we don't understand it.
[time=2062] And most of us don't want to talk about anything we don't understand.
[time=2065] I don't understand election, but I believe it because the Bible teaches it.
[time=2069] The Bible says that before the world was formed, yea, before the foundation of the world, God chose Me and He chose you.
[time=2078] And listen now, the Scripture says He not only chose you, but He called you by your name.
[time=2084] Before the worlds were, before the stars were hung in space and the moon put into its place,
[time=2090] God knew you and He called you by your name, and you are His own particular possession that He has chosen
[time=2097] individually to belong to Him.
[time=2100] You are His by selection.
[time=2103] Mr. Warch is here from the Baptist children's home, and we have a special relationship to that home because of the adoption of our little girl.
[time=2111] And I've often shared with Jan that she is mine and she is Donna's specially because we selected her.
[time=2118] We chose her.
[time=2121] I suppose it is alright for me to say that we don't always expect the little bundles that come into our lives.
[time=2130] But that one we expected and we chose her.
[time=2134] She was ours by choice.
[time=2136] Men and women, we are God's by choice.
[time=2140] He has created us, He has redeemed us, and He has chosen us.
[time=2143] Now you say, what does that have to do with the problem?
[time=2146] Just stay with us a moment.
[time=2147] Notice, secondly, not only the people that He addresses, but the pathway which they must travel.
[time=2155] Now there is a broad today, a philosophy that says, if you become a Christian, that life becomes a bed of roses.
[time=2162] I just don't know any Christians that I talk to who experience that.
[time=2165] In fact, I know a lot of Christians who tell me they never knew what trouble was till they got saved.
[time=2171] God never told us that life would be a time of easy self-indulgence, and there are many prophets of the positive life who give the impression that if you've got a problem in your life,
[time=2181] it's because you're not spiritual or you're not applying the principles of faith or whatever.
[time=2185] There's nothing wrong with that philosophy except everything.
[time=2189] It isn't in the word, it isn't taught by God, and it's an unrealistic approach to life.
[time=2194] God has not promised us problem-free lives, but He has given to us some promises that will help us understand the problems we have.
[time=2201] In the Old Testament, Job, who experienced more than most of us will ever think about, wrote in His book,
[time=2207] that men are born under trouble as the sparks fly upward.
[time=2212] He said that trouble is a part of our life and this veil of tears, we are going to have it.
[time=2216] Notice that He says in this passage of Scripture, there are certain kinds of things we need to expect.
[time=2221] First of all, I want you to notice that this trouble, this pathway, is a divinely ordained pathway by God.
[time=2229] God, through the prophet Isaiah, is telling the people of Israel that they are going to experience certain things in their life.
[time=2237] He mentions a fire and water and trouble and difficulty.
[time=2241] He doesn't say if you experience it. He says when you experience it, it is something that He has chosen to allow to happen in our lives.
[time=2251] It is within the realm of His purpose. We may rebel against it, we may react against it, but God has divinely ordained it.
[time=2258] He allows it to happen. It is a part of His plan.
[time=2262] In the Old Testament book of Job, we are told that He knoweth the way that we take.
[time=2267] And when He has tested us, we will come forth as gold.
[time=2272] And in the 37th Psalm verse 23, we are told that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.
[time=2280] What does that mean? That means that the difficulty I may be facing right now, the problems I'm experiencing in my life,
[time=2287] those are all a part of God's plan for me. I may not like it, I may not understand it.
[time=2293] It may not make any sense to me, but this pathway along which I walk is a divinely ordained and led pathway by God Himself.
[time=2302] He is in charge. Notice, secondly, this pathway along which we walk is a difficult one.
[time=2311] The Bible says it involves waters and rivers and fire and flame.
[time=2319] It says that these things are difficult, and those terms are not terms to describe an easy kind of existence.
[time=2326] They involve intensity, they involve great problems that try the soul.
[time=2332] I have visited this week with several individuals who have told me that they are at the very end of themselves to comprehend what God is doing in their lives.
[time=2340] The difficulties and the problems are so intense, they cannot comprehend what to do.
[time=2345] The problems are real, they're intense, and they touch us as Christians just as really as they touch those outside of Christ.
[time=2352] The pathway is divinely ordained and it is difficult.
[time=2356] I think we need to notice thirdly that it is different.
[time=2360] If you say, "What do you mean by that?" Well, it's different for all of us.
[time=2363] There are some folks that go through the waters, but don't go through the fire.
[time=2369] Some folks who go through the fire, but don't go through the waters.
[time=2373] Some folks who have this kind of testing and some who go in this way.
[time=2377] We cannot sit down and compare our particular test with the test of the person next to us.
[time=2383] Our particular problem with this problem, they're not the same.
[time=2386] There are various kinds of trials.
[time=2388] That's why in the New Testament we're told about the manifold, the variegated colored trials that come into our lives.
[time=2396] One of the most difficult things in helping one another is that we don't experience exactly in our lives what our brother experiences.
[time=2404] We use the term so flippantly, "I know how you feel." And sometimes I say that without thinking and I feel like people want to scream at me, "How could you know what I feel?"
[time=2414] You've never experienced what I've experienced.
[time=2418] The trials we face and the difficulties we find along this pathway which is divinely ordained are different for each one of us.
[time=2426] We are brought together by the reality of the problems, but they are all different.
[time=2430] And we cannot say, "I have experienced exactly what you have experienced." That's why it's a wonderful thing if I could just add it here.
[time=2438] To be able to look up into the face of the Son of God about whom the Word says that He has been tested in all points like unto us.
[time=2447] All points.
[time=2449] He is the only one in the whole universe who can understand the particular kind of problem that I have that you have.
[time=2458] Isaiah writing to the people of Israel says that the problems will be difficult and they will be different.
[time=2467] If you have a chance sometime with paper and pencil in hand, read through the Psalms and just for your own personal edification, write down all the different kinds of problems that the Psalmist mentions when he writes and laments.
[time=2481] While there are so many problems in Psalms, you'd have to have a 10-page tablet to record them all. All kinds of problems.
[time=2491] Well, I'm sure glad the passage doesn't stop here. I've told you the bad news. God says they're going to have some difficult problems and they're different and they're dire.
[time=2501] If I were in the good tradition of a liberal preacher, this is all I'd have to say, folks, it's the rough world. You've got to do the best you can.
[time=2510] That's the kind of spiritual medicine that's being dispensed in many churches these days. Just do the best you can.
[time=2517] Keep a stiff upper lip. Do your own thing. You've got to take it one day at a time, folks. That's all we have to offer. I'm so grateful we got more to offer than that.
[time=2526] The good news in this passage is exciting. And you know, it's the kind of good news with which we arm our minds and our souls as we face the difficulties of life.
[time=2537] Not too long ago, I read the story of Dr. Victor Frankel, who underwent persecution at the hands of the Nazi Gestapo organization.
[time=2546] According to one of the biographies of his life, he was standing about to be tortured and they stripped him of every personal possession that he had.
[time=2556] They stripped him naked. They shaved his body clean. They even came and took his wedding ring off of his finger and took it away from him.
[time=2565] And Dr. Frankel was writing about that particular situation, and he said that the Lord gave him a thought at that moment.
[time=2572] He said it was something that God gave him that helped him through the next difficult moments. It was this.
[time=2578] That they could take everything in the world away from him, but they could not take one thing that he possessed, and that was the attitude that he had about what they were doing.
[time=2589] They could not force upon him any other attitude, but the one he had chosen to have.
[time=2595] And he said, "In my broken situation, everything was out of my control." And that was most difficult, but the one thing I still had was the power to choose my attitude about the problem.
[time=2609] I think that's why God has given to us so many scriptures to help us understand what our attitudes ought to be when the problems come our way.
[time=2618] I watch people in difficulty, some that take it in terms of God's protective provision for their lives and others that just get destroyed and decimated by it.
[time=2629] Who chooses which approach that you have to problems?
[time=2633] Well, in essence, you have the opportunity to do that, and especially as a spirit-filled Christian, you can determine the attitude you bring to your problems.
[time=2642] Now let's notice what is here to arm our minds for the proper spirit and attitude in the midst of our problems.
[time=2650] First of all, let me say there is a fourfold promise for those who experience difficulty in problems in this text.
[time=2658] The first part of this fourfold promise is this.
[time=2662] God has promised that his property will be secure.
[time=2671] As he looks down over this universe and he sees the flames and fires of intensity welling up around,
[time=2677] he says from his heavenly vantage point, "I don't know what all is going to happen down there, but I do want you to know this.
[time=2683] That which belongs to me will be secure." Whatever it is that's mine will make it through the fire to the other side, through the testing and through the trouble.
[time=2693] Whatever it is that is the personal possession of the Lord will be safe and secure.
[time=2700] Notice in this verse, verse 1, two phrases that need to be put together.
[time=2707] Just draw a line between them because they answer this particular point.
[time=2713] Verse 1 says, "Fear not, thou art mine."
[time=2719] I say, "Lord, am I going to make it through this temptation?
[time=2723] Am I going to make it through this trial? The fires are hot and it's tough and I don't know what to do?" And God says, "Your mind don't be afraid because I'm going to protect my possession." Whatever his mind is going to make it through.
[time=2736] That's what we have as Christians. The world doesn't know anything about that.
[time=2739] They don't comprehend that.
[time=2741] I am God's because of creation, because of redemption, because of His choice of me.
[time=2753] I'm secure because I'm in His hand and His hand is in the Father's hand and I belong to Him.
[time=2760] He is promised to protect His personal property.
[time=2765] Notice, secondly, He is promised that His protection will be adequate.
[time=2773] There are some interesting phrases in verse 2 that tell us that every trouble, though it may seem most intense to us, is measured by the grace and mercy of God.
[time=2783] For instance, notice in verse 2, He says that the waters shall not overflow thee.
[time=2789] The fires shall not burn thee and the flame shall not kindle thee.
[time=2795] What does that mean?
[time=2797] It means that God knows what the limits are beyond which we would be overwhelmed completely by our difficulties.
[time=2805] I always like to think of that Old Testament story in the book of Daniel when the Hebrew children were thrown into the furnace.
[time=2811] God knew exactly what He was doing. He knew exactly how that was going to work in the lives of those people.
[time=2819] He did not let that go beyond what they were able to endure miraculously preserved them through it.
[time=2827] Over in the New Testament we're told over and over again that God's grace is sufficient for us in our need.
[time=2833] You may be feeling as if you're close to the edge of breaking, but God won't let it go beyond what He will provide for you,
[time=2840] sufficient grace.
[time=2842] I believe that's what 1 Corinthians 10, 13 means when it says that all of these testings we have are alike unto us,
[time=2848] but God is what, class?
[time=2850] He's what?
[time=2851] He's faithful.
[time=2852] He is faithful not to allow those to go beyond what we are able to bear.
[time=2859] So though the troubles are there and though the problems are there, God measures them out with His grace and mercy,
[time=2865] and He will not allow them to go beyond what we can bear with the keeping of His grace.
[time=2873] And I want you to notice the third part of this fourfold promise is this.
[time=2878] Not only that His property is secure, that His protection is adequate, but that His presence is constant.
[time=2888] Verse 2 says, "When thou passest through the waters," what is it?
[time=2895] "I will be with thee." I've noticed that when people are facing surgery, difficulty, problems, intense times in their life,
[time=2908] I've noticed that we all have something in common and that is that the special people in our lives, we want them to be with us as we face that difficulty.
[time=2917] Several years ago, my father was going through some very serious physical problems.
[time=2922] At first, they thought it was heart.
[time=2925] It turned out to be some gallbladder difficulties, but some of you that know a little bit about that know that the symptoms are often very similar.
[time=2933] My father was going into the hospital for a very sensitive test where they put some sort of a scope up through one of your arteries and look into your heart.
[time=2944] I sensed that he was concerned about that, and I took off the day and drove down to Cedarville to be with my dad.
[time=2953] I don't see my father cry very often, but we kind of hugged each other's neck that day.
[time=2957] I told him, "Dad, I'm right here. I want you to know that, and I'll be with you and we'll be checking with you."
[time=2963] I don't know why. I couldn't do anything to help in the surgery, but that was good for him.
[time=2969] I've noticed that other people like to have the important folks, the folks that mean a lot to.
[time=2974] They like to have them around when there's difficulty.
[time=2979] Isn't it great that those of us who are in the father's family are guaranteed the constant personal presence of Jesus Christ himself?
[time=2991] I will be with thee.
[time=2993] Once again, look at the furnace in Daniel. The fires are heated up, and the children, the three Hebrew children are in the furnace,
[time=3002] and they open it up to look at the intensity of the heat, and when they open the doors, the Scripture says there was a form in there that was like unto the Son of God.
[time=3014] He was not like unto the Son of God. He was the Son of God, and He was present in the midst of the fire.
[time=3023] God is always present with us equally. He is not more present today than tomorrow, but when we are in the midst of testing and difficulty,
[time=3031] we sense His presence more than at any other time.
[time=3035] And I see some of you who are going through difficulties and problems and sorrow and intense grief and hurt.
[time=3042] I just want to share with you that one of the promises of God for those who are hurting is His constant presence.
[time=3049] Now, last but not least, let's notice the fourth part of His promise.
[time=3056] I'm so glad that I believe in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, because you see every word is important.
[time=3063] And if I didn't believe in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, what I'm about to say would really have no impact at all.
[time=3071] But I want you to notice, fourthly, that this promise from God is to the fact that His purpose will be fulfilled.
[time=3078] God has promised that in the midst of our suffering and difficulty, His property will be secure, His protection will be adequate.
[time=3087] His presence will be constant, but fourthly, His purpose will be fulfilled.
[time=3094] Notice in verse two, let me read it the way some folks live it.
[time=3099] "When thou passest into the waters, I will be with thee, and into the rivers they shall not overflow thee.
[time=3107] When thou walkest into the fire, thou shall not be burned." What's wrong with that?
[time=3113] There's a word misplaced, isn't there?
[time=3116] God didn't say He was going to protect us in the fire.
[time=3120] He was going to do what class? He was going to take us through it.
[time=3125] That means that when I'm here and the fire's here, God says I'm going to get over here on the other side of it.
[time=3131] I'm going to pass through the difficulties to God's purpose in my life.
[time=3136] I'm not going to get caught up in the midst of it.
[time=3138] I'm not going to be consumed and destroyed by it.
[time=3140] God sees the whole picture, and He sees me here, and He sees the testing here, but He also sees me over here on the other side of it.
[time=3148] And He says to me, "Child, you may feel like the furnace is hot now, but I will take you through it.
[time=3154] I will let you go through it to the other side." And my purpose for you will be fulfilled.
[time=3162] Annie Johnson Flint, one of my favorite writers, picked the theme up from this, and she wrote these very beautiful words,
[time=3172] which ought to emblazon this truth upon our hearts.
[time=3176] She wrote, "When thou passest through the waters, deep the waves may be in cold.
[time=3183] But Jehovah is our refuge, and His promise is our hold.
[time=3188] For the Lord Himself hath said it, He the faithful God and true, when thou comeest to the waters, thou shall not go down but through."
[time=3198] Seas of sorrow, seas of trial, bitterest anguish, fiercest pain, rolling surges of temptation, sweeping over the heart and brain,
[time=3208] they shall never overflow us, for we know His word is true.
[time=3212] All His waves and all His billows, He will lead us safely through.
[time=3219] Threatening breakers of destruction, doubts insidious undertow, shall not sink us, shall not drag us out to ocean depths of woe,
[time=3228] for His promise shall sustain us, praise the Lord whose word is true.
[time=3234] He shall not go down or under, for He saith, thou passest through, may seem hot and hard and difficult now.
[time=3247] The problems may be overwhelming, you may feel there's nothing that even approximates good news.
[time=3253] But when you're in the water, you're not alone, he's there.
[time=3258] When you're through the rivers, you're not going to be swamped over, he's there.
[time=3263] In the midst of the fires, he is there.
[time=3267] And that's why the hymn writer wrote that beautiful hymn we all enjoy and sing quite often about God's leading us along.
[time=3273] He wrote, "Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fire, but all through the blood,
[time=3282] some through great sorrow, but God gives a song in the night season and a hall the day long."
[time=3291] Amen, amen, shall we pray.
[time=3296] Father, we're so grateful for Your promise, the promise of Your presence and protection and fulfilled purpose in our lives.
[time=3306] Encourage our hearts right now with this truth, while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
[time=3312] If you are not His, if you don't know Him, if He is not Your possession, you are not His possession right now where you are watching at home.
[time=3322] You can pray the sinner's prayer, "Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner, and save me for Jesus' sake.
[time=3328] Fight Him into your heart and into your life, and He will come in today.
[time=3332] And when Jesus Christ comes into your life, you become God's personal possession.
[time=3338] He becomes Yours, and then all of these promises that we've talked about become Yours to personally appropriate in your own life.
[time=3347] When you accept Him, when you invite Him in, please let us know that we might encourage you with some literature that will help you in your growth
[time=3355] as you walk with God in these days ahead.
[time=3358] May He bless you now as you pray that prayer and make Christ your own personal possession.
[time=3364] Father, we pray for those who are right now praying to receive Jesus Christ.
[time=3369] Those who are in this auditorium in a few moments will be making decisions for the old God we pray,
[time=3376] that Your Word will have its continuous free reign in their lives, that the decisions that are made today will be real genuine decisions on the part of each individual,
[time=3387] with our heads bowed and our eyes closed.
