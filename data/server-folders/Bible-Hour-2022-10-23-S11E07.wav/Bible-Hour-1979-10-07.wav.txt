[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the
[time=22] Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=52] We're glad to welcome all of you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and
[time=69] all of our friends who have joined us now by television.
[time=72] We thank God for the privilege of extending this ministry to you and we're grateful for the opportunity we have on this day to welcome you to the ministry of the Word of God and the Black Hawk Baptist Church in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=86] Our special guest throughout this weekend is Bobby Richardson, former second baseman of the New York Yankees and his wife Betsy.
[time=95] Just a few moments we'll be hearing a word of testimony from Bobby and I know that God will use his word to encourage and challenge your heart.
[time=102] Right now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir chosen to sing for us today a song of challenge, "Who is on the Lord's side?"
[time=137] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=282] Thank you choir.
[time=286] I just said to Bobby Richardson that's even better than being on the Yankee side, being on the Lord's side and he said to hardy amen.
[time=294] We're so grateful to God for music and every once in a while I look up and God has brought
[time=300] to us some new musical talent that we hadn't known was here.
[time=304] Two young men who recently moved to this area by the name of Keith and Blake are teaching at the Indiana University Purdue Center here and we found out that they could sing.
[time=315] In fact, someone said they are the hail and wilder of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=321] If you don't know who that is, I won't take time to introduce you to those folks but I've heard them sing once today in the early service and you folks are in for a real blessing.
[time=330] Here they are, Keith and Blake and they're singing "Rejoice, the Lord is King."
[time=335] [MUSIC]
[time=363] Rejoice, the Lord is King.
[time=368] [MUSIC]
[time=372] Mortals give thanks and sing and triumph evermore.
[time=379] [MUSIC]
[time=382] Lift up your hearts.
[time=386] Lift up your voice, rejoice again.
[time=391] I say rejoice.
[time=394] Jesus, the Savior's name.
[time=399] [MUSIC]
[time=413] Lift up your hearts.
[time=418] Lift up your voice, rejoice again.
[time=423] [MUSIC]
[time=450] Lift up your hearts.
[time=479] And take his saints with him to the return home.
[time=489] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice.
[time=505] [MUSIC]
[time=529] [APPLAUSE]
[time=544] We're so glad you've joined us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=547] Normally during this segment that we share with you, my wife Donna would be here but we're into that season of the year when the children start getting ill and so it's necessary from time to time for her to be at home with them.
[time=558] We want to be here and greets all of you in the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=565] We're grateful for this chance that we have to talk with you at home about the very important things that are happening to us here in the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=574] Just this past week I had the opportunity to visit in a home here in our area for another reason and as we were seated together in the living room, a delightful lady shared with me that about a year ago she and her husband had started with me.
[time=587] Her husband had started by accident to watch the Bible Hour and she said in about five weeks after watching one Sunday when you gave the opportunity for people to give their hearts to Christ.
[time=599] We joined hands in the living room and we bowed together before the television set right there in our room and invited Christ into our lives and then she shared with me the growth that had taken place in her family and the things that God had been doing for her.
[time=613] I told her as I left I don't have to hear that but about once a year to make all of the work and the effort of the Bible Hour worthwhile.
[time=620] The young man who was with me as we visited said I wonder how many people she represents.
[time=625] By that he meant how many folks who have come to Christ that we've never heard about.
[time=630] That caused me sort of to remind all of you who watch this program.
[time=634] If God has used the Bible Hour as a means to bring you to Jesus Christ and you've not written to tell us you ought to do that.
[time=641] That would be such a great encouragement to us and we'd love to hear from you.
[time=645] During this particular time in the Bible Hour Ministry we're in the Founders Enrollment Club time of the year.
[time=652] We're asking men and women who have a part in the Bible Hour through the receiving end to get involved in helping us to reach out to even more people.
[time=661] The Founders Club is the core group of people who stand behind the Bible Hour Ministry in prayer and in financial support.
[time=669] Each month they send to us a gift of ten, fifteen, twenty-five dollars.
[time=674] They make that commitment to us as they begin to serve with us in the Founders Club Ministry.
[time=679] And as they give that gift to us they have the opportunity of helping to see that the Gospel gets out each week to the many people who depend on the Bible Hour for their spiritual encouragement.
[time=690] I'm going to ask each of you today who are a part of this great Bible Hour network who are not presently involved in helping as Founders Club members to pray seriously today about the opportunity that has afforded you to be a part of this ongoing ministry and getting the Word of God out into many homes.
[time=711] Now when you join the Founders Club it's not just a one way matter.
[time=715] We send to you some very important items that will help you in your own spiritual growth.
[time=719] One of the things that God has used in a wonderful way are the little verse plaque that go out every month.
[time=725] This one is one of the new ones that has a very familiar verse on it.
[time=728] I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.
[time=732] These little tent cards sit on your bureau, on your desk or perhaps on the mantle at home and they remind you of a very special promise from God's Word.
[time=742] Each month every Founders Club member receives a new verse plaque which they're able to use in any way they deem necessary.
[time=750] Then of course we also have a very special Bible reading plan that we've just introduced called the Daily Walk.
[time=756] And the Daily Walk goes into the homes of every Founders Club member each month.
[time=761] It is a plan to read through the Bible in a year's time.
[time=764] For instance on this particular plan from the book on the New Testament which just started in October you will be reading through the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
[time=775] The plan involves reading the Bible for fifteen or twenty minutes a day.
[time=780] And we'd be happy to include you in that Bible reading program as you join with us in the Founders Club ministry.
[time=787] Along with these items I write a personal letter to all of our Founders Club members and keep them up to date on what's going on with the Bible hour ministry.
[time=796] You receive a very beautiful certificate which is available for framing to remind you of the part you have in the Gospel ministry of the Founders Club.
[time=806] We're so very happy to be able to include so many people in this project where we join hands together to get the Word of God out.
[time=813] Obviously a few of us cannot do it by ourselves. We need your help.
[time=817] We're praying that God will raise up another 500 Founders Club members during these days to get behind the Bible hour ministry in these exciting days of expansion.
[time=827] We're so very happy that many have become involved in the sponsors program.
[time=832] And we wish today to acknowledge a very special sponsor by the name of Mary H. Anderson who on this particular telecast is sponsoring the Bible hour in the Fort Wayne area in memory of Oren J. Anderson.
[time=848] Mary, we thank you for your part in helping the Bible hour ministry in just a few days you'll be receiving this beautiful plaque from my office which will be a reminder to you that on this particular Sunday you help to preach the Gospel
[time=861] to the entire city of Fort Wayne through the sponsors program.
[time=865] We thank you Mary for your part and we encourage you each one of you to continue to pray and be involved in the underwriting of this ministry as much as you are able to do.
[time=876] I'd like to ask all of you who are listening to me now if you're interested in becoming a part of the Founders Club program to sit down this week and write me a letter.
[time=886] And when you write just say simply Pastor Dave we'd like to know more about the Founders Club.
[time=891] As soon as we receive your letter we'll send you the October and November issue of the daily walk so that you can see what that's all about and we'll give you more information about being enrolled in the Founders Club.
[time=902] We also want to encourage many of you who are interested in the sponsors program to let us know so that we can send you the information you need to have in your hands to make your decisions about that.
[time=912] We thank all of you so very much for all you do to make the Bible our possible in your area.
[time=917] We believe it's a ministry God has raised up his hand is upon it and we know he's going to continue to use it in the days ahead with your help under the direction of the Spirit of God.
[time=927] I trust you'll stay with us now as we continue our morning service in just a few moments.
[time=931] I'm going to be preaching my second message in the series of messages on the promises of God.
[time=937] I hope you'll have your Bible ready to share with us a great promise from the Old Testament.
[time=942] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=965] This is the season of the year when if we're not football enthusiasts we're all caught up in the world series which is upon us and the baseball fever at the highest level of the playoffs and championships.
[time=978] For many years that was dominated by the New York Yankees and most of us can remember when they held sway over all of the baseball world during a particular period of time in history.
[time=992] And we're grateful that God has made it possible for us to have one of the great Yankees who made that long reign of championships possible.
[time=1002] Mr. Bobby Richardson has to be our guest today in the services of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1009] Bobby Richardson was the second baseman for the New York Yankees for 10 and a half years.
[time=1014] He is now associated with the Ben Lippins School, a Christian school in the development area, a deeply committed Christian and a real brother in Christ.
[time=1024] He is here this weekend to be a part of our services and will be speaking at a school banquet.
[time=1028] We'll have tomorrow night here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, but it's a real privilege for us to introduce him to you.
[time=1034] He's going to bring a word of testimony to us and I think it's so wonderful and so fitting when we have guests like Bobby here to welcome them to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1043] And let them know that we love them and that we're glad to have them with us.
[time=1047] So let's do that, shall we?
[time=1049] Thank you very much, David.
[time=1057] I appreciate it, David. You're sending Mike Johnson out to pick me up at the airport.
[time=1062] He is really one of the biggest Yankee fans I've ever met and he really made me feel good riding in with him.
[time=1068] I'm really glad to be here. Pat Williams is the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers in basketball and he called me one day to tell me of the impact David Jeremiah had on the Philadelphia Phillies as he spoke to that ball club earlier this season.
[time=1082] He even told me in detail what his message was and so I've been looking forward to coming out and being a part of your services.
[time=1089] When I saw the television cameras, I couldn't help but think that my first year in New York, I'd been there for a little while and they asked me if I'd like to do a commercial.
[time=1097] It was a Gillette company and I told them that I would and they were trying to tie it in with the president's physical fitness program so they took me down to a large YMCA in New York City.
[time=1106] And there we did, that part of the commercial.
[time=1109] I was in a swimming pool with two young boys, one of my teammates was on a handball court and we finished that part and they put us into a cab and took us down to a large studio in New York City.
[time=1120] On the way down, they handed each one of us a slip of paper and on that paper was written one line, you've probably noticed in every given athlete more than one line.
[time=1128] And my line was smooth, you can hardly tell it was a blatant eraser.
[time=1132] It sounded simple, I watched as my teammate booted his line over and over again pretty soon my time came up.
[time=1138] I was to look into the camera, I was to feel my face and realize that I needed a shave which I did.
[time=1143] I was to dip my hands in some warm water, put it on my face, pick up the can of Gillette foamy, shake it twice, relay it to my hand, from my hand to my face, pick up the razor and come down one time and say smooth, you can hardly tell it was a blatant eraser.
[time=1156] I was nervous, I looked into the camera, I felt my face, I needed a shave, I put the warm water, but in the excitement when I picked up that can of Gillette foamy I forgot to shake it, I just squirted it, they had to stop and start over again.
[time=1169] The next time I shook it twice, just like I was supposed to, but I missed my hand, it went off the side, they stopped again.
[time=1175] The next time I started to relay it to my face, my thumb caught on the hair and it went up in my hair, they called timeouts and said bring in a makeup man, let him put on the shaving cream, you finished the commercial.
[time=1185] And so they did, I brought the razor down one time and said smooth, you can hardly tell it was a raid in the blazer.
[time=1192] Last opportunity I ever had to do anything quite like that.
[time=1197] But I'd like to share very briefly tonight that I came to know Christ when I was a teenager because of my pastor.
[time=1204] My pastor came over to my home on a Sunday afternoon and sat down with me.
[time=1208] And I was one of those boys that had grown up in the church, I'd taught a Sunday school class, I'd been faithful in church attendance.
[time=1214] And as he opened the scriptures that day and started sharing those very precious verses of scripture, like when Jesus said I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[time=1225] As he shared with me what Roman says about sin that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and I knew that, and I knew that in my life I displeased God in many ways.
[time=1234] But he pointed out the penalty involved, the wages of sin is death, eternal death.
[time=1239] But then he shared the good news that Christ died for my sins, he was buried, and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.
[time=1246] And that day as a young teenager I guess I realized that I knew about Jesus Christ.
[time=1250] I knew that historically he died on the cross almost 2,000 years ago, but for the first time I was confronted with the fact that it was a personal relationship with a living Savior who gives to us an abundant life.
[time=1262] And that day as a young teenager, a vision of a holy God, sinful man, a great chasm in between.
[time=1269] And I understood that God loved me, had a plan, a purpose for my life, and sent his son the Lord Jesus Christ to shed his precious blood, and promised in his word that if I were repent of my sins, and receive him as Lord and Savior, I might not only have the promise of everlasting life, but the joy of letting him live his life in me.
[time=1288] And that day I did respond, and the verse to seal my decision was John 1, 12.
[time=1293] But as many received him, meaning Jesus Christ, to them gave he power to become the children of God, even to those that believe on his name.
[time=1301] That was a long time ago, baseball came into the picture, I signed right out of high school with the New York Yankees, spent 2 years in the minor league program, and then some wonderful years in New York.
[time=1311] And I became a baseball coach at the University of South Carolina, spent 7 years there, really enjoyed seeing our team finish second in the nation in the College World Series, and that had been left in school in Asheville.
[time=1322] And for 2 days I look forward to getting to know some of you, and speaking to the men of the Church, the Christian School banquet tomorrow night, and just sharing that the Christian life is day by day, Colossians 2-6, says as ye have therefore received Christ, so walk ye in him.
[time=1337] It's an exciting time. My son graduated from Taylor University, not too far from here, he's in graduate school now, and so I've been in and out of this area on occasion.
[time=1346] But I'm glad to be here this weekend, to be able to share what the Lord Jesus Christ means to me. Thank you David.
[time=1355] I sure like to have athletes who are Christians who know how to articulate their faith.
[time=1360] And it's a great thing to know that we have people like that who are in leadership in our country, who are being used of God to share what Jesus Christ means with them.
[time=1369] For all of you who are watching our telecast in this area, and you're seeing the television program live, Bobby Richardson will be speaking to our men here at Black Hawk tonight at 6 o'clock, and his wife Betsy will be speaking to all of the women in the chapel.
[time=1384] And we would certainly invite you to come and share in this unique experience that will be ours tonight to hear in full detail what God has done in the lives of these folks.
[time=1393] Now just before the message, let's listen to the ministry of our Black Hawk singers.
[time=1423] Please, do you believe in a singular love, or is there nothing but darkness around you? Nothing to tell you of heaven above?
[time=1451] Do you believe in my Jesus? Do you believe my Lord?
[time=1467] Or is it just too hard to imagine that He could be who He shares in His world?
[time=1488] Do you believe that He could be the broken? Do you believe in sight to the blind?
[time=1504] Do you believe that He died to forgive you? Or is salvation too hard to find?
[time=1521] Do you believe in my Jesus? Do you believe in my Lord?
[time=1537] Or is it just too hard to imagine that He could be who He shares in His world?
[time=1557] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1577] You can have peace in your mind and your spirit. You cannot fall as a joy in your heart.
[time=1594] You can believe if you trust in the Savior. Yesterday's gone, today you should start.
[time=1611] You can believe in my Jesus. You can believe in my Lord.
[time=1627] You can believe that He died to forgive you. You can believe what He shares in your world.
[time=1657] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers. They're some of the finest singers we ever have in this church.
[time=1668] And the good thing about them is their hours. They belong to us. And they're part of us.
[time=1673] And last night they were down in Huntington. Some folks that we have as television friends down there, and they were down to sing, had a great time, met so many wonderful people.
[time=1682] And I know they were a blessing because everywhere they go they share the good news of the gospel through music,
[time=1688] and it brings blessing to the hearts of people. Now we're in a series of messages in this morning time on the great promises of the Word of God.
[time=1698] And the day we're going to be looking at a promise found in the Old Testament book of Psalm, Psalm 126, Psalm 126.
[time=1708] These are days of great discouragement for most folks. And there's not much good news around in the world, but there is some good news from God.
[time=1717] And so I thought it would be just a wonderful thing for us to do to open the book and pick out some of those great promises God has given us
[time=1725] and emphasize them for these few days as we look up to the time of Thanksgiving.
[time=1730] And today our promise is found in the 126th Psalm. Last week we looked at the promises of God in Isaiah 43 for the discouraged heart.
[time=1740] Today we're going to look at a promise from God for the faithful soul winner, Psalm 126.
[time=1748] And I'm reading from my Bible as you follow in yours, Psalm 126 beginning at verse 1.
[time=1754] "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing.
[time=1763] Then said they among the nations, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us, we're of we're glad.
[time=1771] Turn again our captivity, O Lord, like the streams in the Negev. They that sow and tear shall reap and joy.
[time=1778] He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
[time=1787] Father, we ask that you will open our hearts to your word. May the word of God be as the precious seed, these verses speak of,
[time=1795] being deposited in the fertile soil of our hearts that we might be changed to be more like Jesus Christ, our Savior, for we pray in His name and for His sake.
[time=1806] Amen. My message today is on the subject, the promise for soul winners.
[time=1813] Now the 120th through the 134th Psalms are what the Bible speaks of as the Psalms of degrees, or the Psalm of ascent.
[time=1824] Scholars who have studied these Psalms tell us that they were the songs that were sung by the Jewish people as they made their way back from Babylon,
[time=1832] having been freed from Babylonian captivity.
[time=1836] The Psalms became so popular in the Jewish community that as they would win their way to Jerusalem in years following for the Jewish feast,
[time=1844] they would sing these songs on their way to the Jerusalem worship site to celebrate the feasts of Judaism.
[time=1852] Others have told us that when they would come to the city of Jerusalem, there were 15 steps leading to the court of Israel in the temple.
[time=1861] And the faithful Jewish patriots would take each one of these Psalms,
[time=1867] and as they walked up the 15 steps to the court of Israel, on the first step they would sing Psalm 120,
[time=1874] and on the second step they would sing Psalm 121, and on through the 134th Psalm.
[time=1881] Now the Psalm that we are studying today is Psalm 126, and it's one of the Psalms of decrees.
[time=1888] It is a song of rejoicing from the point of view of the people of Israel who have just been freed from 70 years of captivity under the Babylonians.
[time=1900] The Jewish remnant under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah, Zerubbabel and the prophets Hagii and Zachariah are back in the land,
[time=1909] and this Psalm is a Psalm probably written by Hezekiah rejoicing over their freedom from bondage.
[time=1918] It is a Psalm that is very beautiful to read. It is filled with both joy and pathos.
[time=1924] It is a Psalm of joy because the remnant has been freed. It's a Psalm of sorrow because they still remain in Babylon, those who are under captivity.
[time=1934] The Psalm can be understood in three levels of interpretation and application.
[time=1940] First of all, it is a Psalm which will certainly, as far as the last two verses are concerned, find application in the period of great tribulation.
[time=1949] The book of Daniel tells us that during the tribulation period there will be faithful Jewish Christians who will be used of God to canvas salvation throughout the Jewish community, and many will be saved.
[time=1962] Daniel chapter 12 and verse 3 tells us that these who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.
[time=1975] And so when the passage speaks of people winning souls and going forth and weeping and bringing forth sheaves, it has a reference immediately to the Jewish remnant that will be used of God in the tribulation period.
[time=1990] Secondly, I believe we can wonderfully apply this to the life of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1996] One of the most interesting facts about Jesus Christ is this, that the Bible never records of him that he left.
[time=2004] It is filled with the truth of his sorrow. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[time=2010] Hebrews tell us that he prayed with strong crying. We know of his weeping in the Garden of Gethsemane. We read in the book of Matthew that he had great compassion for the city of Jerusalem and his heart was broken.
[time=2021] But we never read about him that he laughed. He was a man who knew the meaning of tears and of sorrow, and as he walked upon this earth for the 33 years of his life, he went about sowing the seeds of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven, and he sowed those seeds with tears and with crying.
[time=2039] The seeds were brought forth in the lives of his disciples, and ultimately in his own life as it was sown in his body in the grave and resurrected to new life.
[time=2049] And ultimately, according to the prophecy of the Word of God, he will come back again rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him at the second advent, which we read so much about in the New Testament book of Revelation.
[time=2061] But the third and most appropriate application of this wonderful psalm is to all of us who are present here today and all who hear my voice.
[time=2071] It is the application of this psalm to the great commission which has been given to all of us in this generation.
[time=2078] For the Bible tells us in the New Testament that we are to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
[time=2085] We could, as it were, take Matthew and the 28th chapter and ask the first chapter and all of the other instructions given to Christians for world evangelization, and we could lay them together in these two verses.
[time=2098] For here we have in this Old Testament psalm in two verses of Scripture God s great plan and promise for those who will be involved in the enterprise of the kingdom of God.
[time=2111] Now I want you to notice how simply it is put together, each word with great meaning.
[time=2116] In the fivefold plan of God for reaching our world, each word in verses five and six are fraught with meaning.
[time=2124] If you could, I wish you could take the verses and put them together in a special way as we look first of all at the soul winners plan.
[time=2132] Read the phrases that look like this.
[time=2141] Those phrases put together provide for us the plan of God for winning our world to Jesus Christ.
[time=2148] It is the soul winners plan.
[time=2150] He that go forth bearing precious seed and so is it.
[time=2155] Now notice the five parts of the plan.
[time=2158] First of all, this plan is a definite plan.
[time=2161] Notice that the first word is the word he.
[time=2164] He that go forth and sow it.
[time=2167] It is a change from the pronoun of the previous verse where the word they, the plural pronoun is used.
[time=2173] Here it is the singular pronoun, identifying the individual responsibility of everyone to be involved in God s plan.
[time=2182] God s plan involves humanity, it involves individuals, it is not a plan that he used when he called forth his angels to preach the gospel.
[time=2190] The angels desire to look into salvation, but they are not the ambassadors of salvation.
[time=2196] The hymn writer has said that the angels could not do this, for angels never knew the joy that our salvation brings.
[time=2203] In order to be a part of this plan, in order to fall into the category that is meant by the word he, one must be a redeemed, born again Christian who has experienced salvation.
[time=2214] It is an individual plan, it is saved sinners, finding lost sinners who need to be saved.
[time=2221] It is men who have come to know Christ, going to tell men who need to know Christ, how they can find him.
[time=2228] It is a plan that is personal and it involves individuals.
[time=2234] Now notice secondly that this plan is not only definite in that it involves individuals, but this plan is also dynamic.
[time=2241] By that I mean it involves activity, he that goeth.
[time=2247] Now there is a wonderful way in which so many modern Christians have reversed God s plan.
[time=2253] Someone has said very appropriately that in the New Testament church of today we have ceased to become fishers of men and we have become keepers of aquariums.
[time=2263] We no longer go fishing for fish, we just get our fish together in a little pool and we rejoice in how many fish we have together in one place.
[time=2271] But the divine dynamic of the gospel upon which the promise in this passage of scripture is contingent is that we go to share the gospel where people are who need to hear it.
[time=2285] And wherever God is blessing and wherever men and women are being saved it is because they have grabbed hold of this plan and its dynamic.
[time=2294] They have refused to settle down in their churches and wait for people to come to them and they have gone out to fish for men.
[time=2303] We hear quite often people apply the great promise of the great commission, low I am with you all way even unto the end of the earth.
[time=2311] I remember hearing some time ago the story of a pastor who went into an airport and it was necessary for him to get his wife across the country.
[time=2322] And he was definitely afraid of flying, he didn t want to get on the plane.
[time=2326] And he was bargaining with the airline attendant who was giving him the ticket and he was going to take the train.
[time=2332] He was going to put his wife on the plane, he was going to take the train and meet her several days later on the other side of the country.
[time=2338] And the airline attendant was giving him a bad time and he said I thought you were a preacher.
[time=2343] He said don t you believe, don t you believe that even though you are frightened if you get on that plane and you fly in that plane you can get to the other side of this country safely.
[time=2352] Doesn t the Bible promise you, doesn t God promise you that if you put yourself in his hands that he will take care of you wherever you go?
[time=2361] Isn t that even in the great commission said the knowledgeable airline attendant and the pastor with a smile in his face said yes that is in the great commission but I want to remind you what it says.
[time=2371] The great commission says low I will be with you.
[time=2376] And he was going to obey that.
[time=2382] He misunderstood that but you know there are many other folks who have misunderstood it in a different way.
[time=2387] And I find people every way who think that promise is appropriate for every situation but I want you to notice that the low in that promise is contingent on the go in that promise.
[time=2399] Go into all the world and low I am with you.
[time=2402] And I believe that wherever men and women take the command to go seriously, God in a wonderful and special way goes with them and protects them and provides for them and causes their needs to be met.
[time=2415] So as you look across the country today, you will find that the great and growing churches are the soul winning churches who are going and the churches that are dying and have no reason for existence and are shriveled up and trying everything under the sun to cause growth to happen
[time=2430] are the churches that have settled down conveniently and are waiting for the people to come.
[time=2435] You cannot even spell the word gospel without first spelling the word go. Go is in the gospel. It is a dynamic plan to take the word of God where people are.
[time=2446] I want you to notice thirdly that this plan of God is a plan that is a decisive plan.
[time=2454] He that goeth forth. Now the word forth is a word which has in its connotation the idea that you leave where you are to where you need to be.
[time=2465] When you go, you go from here to there. So in going forth, you leave behind you certain things.
[time=2472] Now in the Psalm that we're reading and studying, there is the picture of the people of Israel leaving the Babylonian captivity behind.
[time=2480] Obviously all of us who would be soul winners need to understand that we must leave our bondage of sin behind you can't be a soul winner and effective one unless first of all you know Christ yourself.
[time=2490] You leave your sin behind but you know I'm discovering in this generation that becoming a soul winner and being faithful to God's plan for evangelism involves leaving some other things behind as well.
[time=2502] I was reminded again as we started evangelism class just recently that not anyone that I've ever met has come to me and said preacher I am here in evangelism class tonight to go out soul winning because I feel so very comfortable
[time=2517] about going into strange homes and telling people about the Lord. I never feel more comfortable in all my life than when I have the wonderful rich opportunity to get out in those different situations I just feel so at home.
[time=2529] Nobody has ever said that to me. In fact the exact opposite is true. During the first few weeks of evangelism as we meet together around the supper I think the consumption of food is much less than it normally would be.
[time=2541] We have some folks that adopt the program of fasting during the first few days of evangelism not because they've determined to do it but because they just are too nervous to eat.
[time=2552] There is something that has to be left behind if we're going to go forth and part of that is the comfort and the ease and the security that we find in our own situations. It's much easier to stay home watch television be with the family all of the other things than to go forth.
[time=2566] But the Bible says if we're to be a part of God's plan we have to leave where we are to get where we need to be so that we can talk to people about Jesus Christ.
[time=2575] It means taking time to make a decision that by the Spirit of God you will be a channel through which the Spirit can work in telling others about the Savior.
[time=2585] This plan is a decisive plan. One day a young lady came to her pastor and she said preacher I've watched you and the people that you've won to Christ.
[time=2594] She said oh pastor I'd give the world if I could be a soul winner like you are and he looked at her right straight in the eye and he said young lady that's exactly what it cost me.
[time=2604] It cost me the world. It cost me everything that I wanted for myself and I gave it to God and he's blessed it and made it possible for me to be effective in touching other lives.
[time=2617] I want you to notice fourthly that this plan is a defined plan. When we individually leave the comforts of home and we go forth to tell the gospel what is it that we say.
[time=2629] Well it's quite easily defined in this text it says he that goeth forth bearing precious seed.
[time=2636] Now what is the seed? Well according to the book of Luke the seed is the word of God.
[time=2641] It is God's word which we use to sow in the hearts of people and in the book of Peter we're told that these promises are exceeding precious.
[time=2649] They're of great value to God and obviously the picture here is of the Oriental farmer who slings over his shoulder the bag of seed.
[time=2658] He goes out into the freshly plowed field and each bit of seed that he takes from the bag is sown individually in the ground.
[time=2667] The seed itself is the result of a whole year's proper cultivation and it is the seed corn that he has properly saved for the planting of next year's crop.
[time=2677] And so he individually according to the Oriental custom takes the seed and he drops it in the ground along the way.
[time=2684] Here's some and there's some. Every little kernel of seed is important. It is that precious seed which is going to make the difference in the crop of the year to come.
[time=2692] And the writer of the book of Psalms in this particular situation perhaps Hezekiah has said that going forth with the gospel is like taking that seed corn,
[time=2703] the word of God, that precious seed which God has given to us, that wonderful truth which we have and going out into the highways and the byways.
[time=2711] Here dropping some, here some, sowing it in this heart, in that heart, at the plant, at the office, at visitation on the street wherever we can with a tract here or a word here or a song here to sow the word of God.
[time=2726] It is the precious seed and you know there's not any way any person can get to heaven apart from God's word and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2734] Those two ingredients are the absolute least common denominators of salvation. Without God's word and the ministry of the Holy Spirit, no one is ever converted.
[time=2745] And so what a thrill it is for us to take this precious seed and to bear it. It is a defined plan.
[time=2752] It is everything God has for us to share with others this book, the seed of the gospel.
[time=2757] And then notice that this plan is a directed plan. It is a wonderful thing to be able to carry God's word and have it in your hand, have it in your head, have it in your heart.
[time=2772] That's wonderful. But men and women it's not enough to know God's word. If we know it and we don't sow it, no one will ever come to Christ.
[time=2783] I know a lot of Christians who are very proud of all of the Bible knowledge they've amassed.
[time=2788] They can quote every verse that they've ever learned, give you all of the books of the Bible frontward and backward, give you the kings of the Old Testament, both in the northern and southern kingdom.
[time=2798] They can tell you all of the Roman Empire and how it fits together. They've got all of this knowledge. They know it.
[time=2805] But if you ask them when was the last time you ever told anybody what you know that will make a difference in their lives, they get all read and crimson from embarrassment.
[time=2814] There seems to be a tendency in special places, sometimes in academic communities, to become intellectual about the Word of God.
[time=2823] And to just get all of this information collected together and boast with one another about how much we know we have prophecy conferences and Word of God conferences and Bible conferences and all kinds of conferences where we come together to know.
[time=2837] And there is no premium on ignorance in God's plan. But men and women to know it and not to sow it is the greatest travesty of justice I can think of.
[time=2846] To be able to sit around and brag about what we know and never go to share even the basic elements with the people around us who are dying and on their road to a Christless Hell is the greatest kind of selfishness known to man.
[time=2862] The Bible says we must sow it. What does that mean? Well, that means that the seed in the basket won't do. You've got to get it out of the basket and into the ground.
[time=2871] You've got to get it out of your life and into the fertile hearts of the people who need to hear.
[time=2876] To know the truth without sowing it is to miss God's plan and his blessing.
[time=2883] A man or a woman who goes forth bearing the seed of God's Word and sows it in the life of another man or woman is involved in the greatest enterprise known to the world today.
[time=2895] Now that's the plan of the soul winner. Now let me talk to you secondly about the passion or compassion of the soul winner.
[time=2904] Two times in these two verses we read the words about tears and weeping. He that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed, they that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
[time=2921] One of the ingredients that seems to be so missing among Christian people today is the ingredient of concern or compassion for people outside of Christ.
[time=2931] Some time ago in one of our Wednesday night services we saw a film about a family and one of the members of the family being outside of Christ came to Christ.
[time=2941] It was very moving. I think it may have been the film of the story of Colonel Bottomly who came to know Christ.
[time=2949] After the film was over I asked the people in our fellowship who were present that night how many of you have unsaved loved ones who still need to know Christ.
[time=2961] The auditorium was dark and I couldn't see very well but I didn't need to see or I could hear sniffles and crying people clearing their throat all over the congregation people weeping because of unsaved loved ones.
[time=2979] I thought to myself that night that is one of the first steps toward rectifying that problem but men and women we hear that and see that far too far too few times.
[time=2991] General William Booth who for years was the president of the Salvation Army when it was indeed the Salvation Army said that if he could he would like to send all of the candidates for officers ship in his organization to hell for 24 hours.
[time=3006] He said if I could do that I could do away with most of the rest of the training for they would come back from that awful place and the realization that that's where everyone outside of Christ is headed with a drive and compassion that I could not possibly teach in the classroom.
[time=3022] How long has it been since there was a tear in your eye because you knew somebody who wasn't going to heaven.
[time=3030] It's easy for us to be so flippant about it we're inside we've got the faith we know Christ we just go along in our life with business as usual not ever stopping to look around us at people who are plunging headlong into eternity without the Lord and it doesn't seem to really make any difference to us.
[time=3048] He that goeth forth with tears with compassion.
[time=3055] Fellow by the name of Robert Murray McShane has been a great encouragement to my life a great preacher a great man of God.
[time=3063] One day in the city where he ministered a young boy who was going into the ministry came to the church where he preached and asked to see the Sexton and wanted to know if he could look through the church.
[time=3077] The Sexton took him on a tour and showed him the various places in the building and as they were moving toward the study the young preacher boy said to him he said could you tell me from your observation how Robert Murray McShane studies.
[time=3096] He said yes sir I can he said come over here and took him over to a chair in the pastor's study and he said sit down.
[time=3103] Now he said put your hands over your face and he said now let the tears fall.
[time=3112] That's the way my master studies and they left they left the study and went on down to the place where the great preacher preached.
[time=3123] And the young would be pastor he said could you tell me how from your observation Robert Murray McShane preached he said yes sir I can.
[time=3131] He said just lean out over the place.
