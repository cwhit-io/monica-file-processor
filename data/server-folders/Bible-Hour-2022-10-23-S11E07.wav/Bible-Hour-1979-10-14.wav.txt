[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We present the Bible
[time=25] with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=55] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=82] We welcome you to this service, not only to those of you who have joined with us here in the Convocation Center, but to all of our many friends who join us now by way of television.
[time=92] We're grateful for the privilege that God has given us to extend the ministry of this church into your home and into your life. It is our prayer that this will be an hour of blessing and encouragement of inspiration and instruction. Our special guest today is
[time=108] Congressman Dan Quayle, and in a few moments he will be giving a word of testimony that will encourage your heart. Right now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir as they remind us in music of the wonderful blessing we have in the unbounded grace of
[time=124] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=150] [AMEN - 208 seconds]
[time=363] Thank you choir for that ministry to us. We had the opportunity last night to go to a church here in this city where Paul and Marianne Matthews put on a very fine music conference and
[time=376] I was so proud of our musicians as they ministered there the Black Hawk Singers. I just am grateful to God that he's given us the outreach that we have through the ministry of music. It goes many places where otherwise the gospel would not be permitted to go and we have opportunities every week to extend the ministry of this church through music.
[time=400] Just a few weeks we'll be sharing in some banquets for our television people in all of the areas where this program is seen and young lady who's going to be doing some of the music at those banquets is our own star narwhal. She's going to sing for us now.
[time=413] [MUSIC - 243 seconds]
[time=664] We so appreciate you joining with us on today's edition of the Bible Hour, and we're grateful for this opportunity,
[time=678] which we look forward to every week, an opportunity to step aside from the morning service and talk with you personally there in your own home.
[time=686] And as always, Donna has joined with me today to share with you some of the exciting things that are happening in the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=693] Donna, this week I had the wonderful privilege of meeting a man from this area who has been so blessed by the Bible Hour television ministry and he told me the story of how he had listened week after week and had the opportunity to do something for the Bible Hour as a part of a will that he had ministry with and he and his wife have determined that they're going to direct a rather large sum of money through a will in the state to the Bible Hour television ministry so that this program can continue to reach many more people in the future.
[time=724] It's that kind of commitment and dedication on the part of Friends of the Bible Hour that bring us the encouragement we need from time to time to keep on going because it's a very expensive and costly ministry.
[time=735] What he has done in a very large scale way is being done well across the entire spectrum of the Bible Hour ministry through what we call the Founders Club and I think it would be good since we're in the enrollment time for the Founders Club ministry if you would share just a brief resume of what's involved in being a part of the Founders Club ministry here at the Bible Hour.
[time=754] The Founders Club is made up of a core group of people who support the Bible Hour on a monthly basis with their financial support and also with their prayers.
[time=765] At this time we are endeavoring to enroll 500 new members in the Founders Club
[time=771] in order to bring our financial support up to where it needs to be.
[time=775] And we would encourage you if you watch the Bible Hour and if it meets a need in your life to join our Founders Club by giving 15, 20, 25 dollars, whatever the Lord lays upon your heart to support the Bible Hour each month.
[time=789] And in return for that we would like to share a number of things with you.
[time=793] And I'm very excited about the many premiums that God has given us to share with our friends at home.
[time=799] I guess we call them premiums here.
[time=801] They're really gifts and opportunities to extend the ministry of the Bible Hour into your home.
[time=806] And we've made a decision a long time ago that we don't want to send anything to you that won't be of benefit to you spiritually.
[time=812] We are not interested in being in the jewelry business or the other things that are so popular on television today because they have no real spiritual and eternal value.
[time=823] So we're sending Bible study helps, encouragement that will help you to get into the Word and get started in your daily walk with the Lord.
[time=831] That's why we call this little tool the daily walk.
[time=834] It's a book to help you read through the Bible in a year through the entire scripture in one year.
[time=841] Spending 15 to 20 minutes a day you can read through the entire scripture in 365 days.
[time=848] For instance, in the month of November, as you were to start out, you would open your booklet to the November 1 date and there you would have your scripture assignment, which happens to be the first chapters in the book of Acts.
[time=860] As you begin to read the commentary that goes along with your Bible reading, you will see an overview of the passage.
[time=865] As you read that overview, it will give you understanding of what's going on in the text itself.
[time=870] Then there is a chart showing what's in every single chapter and then after you have read the scripture, you come back and find some very important points of application of that passage of scripture to your own life.
[time=883] A section on insight helps you to know how the daily walk can be of value to you in your walk with the Lord that day.
[time=890] We have just recently started in the New Testament during the month of October and we would be delighted to send you both the October and November issues of the daily walk if you're interested in becoming a part of the Founders Club Ministry.
[time=904] All of those who support our Founders Club on a regular basis automatically receive this monthly publication to help them read the Bible and to read it through each day.
[time=914] I think that it's exciting to me to know that the Bible can be a help to you where you are and that's why we provide this tool for you.
[time=922] There are many other things that we send each month to our Founders Club members.
[time=927] A little watch word which is a scripture memory card that has a very important passage of scripture on it.
[time=933] A certificate, a personal letter from the pastor to keep you up to date on the insight information of the Bible, our television ministry.
[time=940] All of these things are our way of saying to you we appreciate your support when you get involved in the Founders Club Ministry.
[time=947] We're also very happy to have a number of folks who have sponsored us during these past months, men and women who have given large amounts of money, some of them smaller amounts to make sure that the Bible hour continues on the station where they happen to watch it.
[time=962] Donna has a list of folks who are involved in the sponsors program and I'd like for you to share these names with our friends at home.
[time=969] We have a number of people today who are sponsoring the Bible hour.
[time=973] Esther Devaux is sponsoring it here in Fort Wayne over Channel 21.
[time=978] Mr. and Mrs. Lauren Rich, formerly of Fort Wayne who now live in Arizona, are sponsoring the program today.
[time=986] Imogene Johnson is sponsoring it in memory of James L. Ray Myers on Channel 21 here in Fort Wayne.
[time=994] Also, Oren Lewis on Channel 21 and Reverend Carlisle Scott on Channel 40.
[time=1000] Donna Carlisle Scott is an evangelist friend that we have known for some time when children go to our church and it's exciting to have him share in the ministry there.
[time=1010] Now the sponsors program, the Founders Club, and all of this very pertinent information about the Bible hour and how it continues to come to you is available to you if you will write to us this week.
[time=1022] We would love to hear from many of our Bible hour friends who would write to us and say, "Pastor Dave, we'd love to be a part of helping to share the gospel, maybe through the sponsors club, but the information you need is readily available to you in writing and we'd be ever so happy to send it to you if you've just requested." We get letters every week from people who are saying, "What can I do to help?" Here are two good ways you can get involved, either as a sponsor or through the Founders Club ministry.
[time=1051] But of course, before that happens, we must hear from you.
[time=1054] So we would like to ask you to write to us this week and let us know of your interest in being a part of this television ministry.
[time=1061] Down to this week, I met three or four people who once again reminded me that the Bible hour ministry is unique in that it is a declaration of God's Word plus or minus nothing, and I guess that is unique in this day and age, isn't it?
[time=1075] Yes, it certainly is.
[time=1077] And if you'd like to have a part in this, we would urge you to write to us today just write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 1-5-250-Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1091] We'll look forward to hearing from you this week.
[time=1093] We would like to have a letter from you.
[time=1095] It's very important that many of you write during these days.
[time=1099] And once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 1-5-250-Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1108] Now, in just a moment, I'm going to be preaching the third in a series of messages on the subject, God's promises to you.
[time=1115] And today, I'm going to be dealing with a very familiar text, God's Promise for Guidance from the Book of Proverbs, Chapter 3.
[time=1123] I trust you'll have your Bibles ready so that you can join with us as we study the Word of God today.
[time=1142] ♪
[time=1162] Thank you for that good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=1169] We are so grateful to have with us today, as our special guest in this service, U.S. Congressman from Indiana's Fourth District, Mr. Dan Quail.
[time=1180] We are grateful that he made the special effort to be here today through some very difficult weather conditions
[time=1186] that made it necessary for him to fly in late last night in a private plane for our own Bruce Bone, who flew him here so that he could be with us today.
[time=1195] We're grateful for Mr. Dan Coats, who is his representative to this district, and he is with us in the service.
[time=1201] I'm going to ask that he would stand, please, so that you will all see him.
[time=1204] Please recognize him and greet him.
[time=1207] And then most of all, we're happy to have Dan with us to give us a word of testimony.
[time=1212] He represents us in the United States government, and we're grateful that we have the kind of representation that we have from a Christian person who knows and understands our needs and is representing them in the Congress.
[time=1225] I want you to join with me in welcoming him to the Black Hawk Baptist Church so that he'll know we're glad to have him with us today, Mr. Dan Quail.
[time=1233] Thank you very much, Pastor Jeremiah, and it's indeed a pleasure to be here,
[time=1248] and it's such a great day in Fort Wayne outside, and it's so warm inside as we're praising the Lord, and I can just recall back when I was 17 years
[time=1259] and remember so vividly when my life began again on a Sunday night.
[time=1264] It's on a Sunday night after a weekend of church activities and the first Presbyterian Church in Huntington, Indiana, where my home is.
[time=1272] And after a weekend of activities, it was Sunday night that a number of my high school friends and myself made that personal commitment
[time=1281] and the strongest commitment and placed our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1286] The Lord we know has died for our sins, and because of our faith in him,
[time=1292] that we will have eternal life.
[time=1295] And then that following week at high school, we would go up to one another, girls and boys together, and shake hands, and say, praise the Lord, because we had a new bondage, a new friendship, a new warmth in life.
[time=1309] And since that time, and my career has been very, very fortunate so far,
[time=1316] and God has been very good to me, and he's been a very intimate part since that time, and I went to DePaul University, went on to Indiana University Law School, and met my wife, who is also a Christian, and since that time, we've been blessed with three children.
[time=1331] Three children, and the Lord, as you well know, operates in mysterious ways, and he has his plan and those that have committed their life to him to understand that.
[time=1339] And our first child was born two weeks before the bar examination, which Marilyn and I both took at the same time.
[time=1346] The first time that she was out of the house was to take that bar exam.
[time=1349] Fortunately, we both passed it.
[time=1351] Second child, another, again a boy, was born three days.
[time=1355] Three days after the election, my first election in 1976, and in 1978, at election time again, the Lord blessed us with a little girl.
[time=1365] And everyone's asking about, "Well, now you're going into 1980." I will wait and see.
[time=1373] My little two-year-old is just, he just still doesn't understand why I'm gone so much, and that is really one of the drawbacks as you get in public life.
[time=1382] But he is beginning to understand, he sings a little song now at home, and he, God, walking through a storm, and he always ends up, he says, "Well, you're never alone when you have God in your heart." And this is my little two-year-old saying that, and it's very rewarding, and we're trying to develop a Christian foundation within the family because believe me.
[time=1402] The type of lifestyle that you have to lead you, the Christian foundation is really something that keeps a family together.
[time=1409] And I think that as being a Christian and also being in politics, sometimes that has a bad connotation with Christians, but you'd be surprised on how many Christians are in the House of Representatives in the United States Senate.
[time=1421] We have a prayer breakfast in the House, and the Senate does, likewise, on Thursday mornings.
[time=1426] Format is open, you can give your personal testimony, you can talk about a verse in the Bible, you can talk about politics, whatever you want.
[time=1434] And it's gratifying to see a number of Christian people.
[time=1439] We have preachers and pastors in the House of Representatives and also in the Senate.
[time=1445] And as I determined, one of the strong messages from God is that we believe so strongly
[time=1452] in individual liberty and freedom.
[time=1454] And this country was founded upon freedom, religious freedom.
[time=1456] The pilgrims came over here for religious freedom.
[time=1459] And I feel that sometimes that we're seeing a decline in freedom in this country
[time=1465] and the world takes since World War II, the countries that have lost freedom.
[time=1470] The freedom to worship, freedom to associate.
[time=1473] And I think in our own country today with some of the problems, and one of the problems that I know that affects you right here, we just went through a battle with the Internal Revenue Service on regulations on Christian schools.
[time=1484] Some of the regulations we've fortunately got that overturned would have been very detrimental to Christian schools.
[time=1490] And I think that I as you believe, and I'm sure Pastor Jeremiah would swear, we do insist on separation of church and state.
[time=1499] We don't want the state telling the church what to do, and we don't want the church telling the state what to do.
[time=1504] But since the over-involvement I think of the federal government, in particular you've seen more Christian people come forward in getting into the political system, and I think it was Edmund Burke that referred, for evil to triumph, let good people do nothing.
[time=1518] So I am just deeply gratified, Pastor Jeremiah, to be here and to share my public testimony with you and a few words of what I think Christians ought to be doing in this country, and to encourage and to support what you're doing, and trying to give the message to this country to return to God and the Bible.
[time=1537] Thank you very much.
[time=1539] (Applause)
[time=1554] Dan was in the early service, and he and his party are going to have to leave now, but I have to admit that when I hear a man who is in government say the things that he says so openly, I breathe a little sigh of relief just for a moment, and I'm grateful that he's raising up in our land, Christians who aren't afraid to stand up in the political arena and let their testimony be known.
[time=1576] And so that's our prayer as we think of his ministry that God will enable him to do that.
[time=1581] Just before the message, here are the men singers to sing for us.
[time=1589] I am weak, but thou are strong.
[time=1603] Jesus keeps me from our own.
[time=1617] I'll be satisfied as my own.
[time=1630] As I walk, let me walk close to thee.
[time=1649] Just a closer walk with thee.
[time=1660] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[time=1690] Through this world of joy and strength,
[time=1703] He is my falter, Lord who cares,
[time=1716] My burden shares, not my thee, Lord, not my thee.
[time=1731] Just a closer walk with thee.
[time=1745] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[time=1760] Let it be, dear Lord, when my feeble life is old.
[time=1772] Let it be, dear Lord, guide me gently to thy show.
[time=1787] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
[time=1817] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=1882] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=1905] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=1932] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=1960] let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=1979] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=2007] let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=2029] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=2056] let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=2081] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=2108] let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be,
[time=2132] dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord, let it be, dear Lord,
[time=2160] it is interesting to me that God has, throughout His Word, given us some very specific design,
[time=2166] so that we might know what His plan for our life really is. I suppose the most often asked question
[time=2172] of preachers in the fundamental faith in this day and age is how do you know God's will for your life?
[time=2178] And there are so many different secret plans that are broadcast about, and it's so easy for us
[time=2184] to find some formula and to miss the clear teaching of God's Word. Now the simple truth of the Word of God
[time=2192] found in this passage of Scripture is this, God makes a promise to every person that He will personally
[time=2200] direct their lives. Now this promise is not an unconditional promise, but rather it is a conditional
[time=2206] promise. In this scope, in this verse, there is a twofold understanding which we must bring to ourselves.
[time=2214] First of all, we must understand what our part is in this and then what God's part is. And the Scripture says
[time=2222] that if we will do our part, God will do His part, and the result of that will be an unbelievable
[time=2230] directive for our lives day by day. This is God's promise to me and to you that we can have guidance
[time=2238] and direction in our lives. Now as we examine the text, let us notice first of all the condition of God's
[time=2244] promise for direction. In the first verse, there are two conditions, one of which is positive and
[time=2250] the other is negative. The positive condition is this, trust in the Lord with all thine heart.
[time=2258] Now the word trust comes to us out of the Hebrew language, and it is a word which is very vivid in its understanding. It is a word which literally means to lie face down upon.
[time=2270] It is the picture of someone lying face down upon the ground, resting his entire weight
[time=2276] upon the earth. It is the picture of one who in desperation flings himself over the bed
[time=2282] face down, resting his complete weight upon the bed. The context and the meaning
[time=2290] of the word trust is to come to the place where you totally and completely and without reservation
[time=2296] lean and completely rest upon the Lord in your life.
[time=2302] It is a promise which comes to us conditioned upon our willingness to give the Lord Jesus
[time=2309] everything there is to have of us and to trust ourselves completely to him.
[time=2313] Now there are two things that the text says about this. First of all, it says we're to do it with our whole heart. Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[time=2323] That means that there is no room in this directive from God for any half-hearted commitment
[time=2329] to him. Today I will and tomorrow I won't kind of relationship with him, but the Bible says it is to be a whole-hearted commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ. I have been overwhelmed in recent study of the word of God as I have examined the scriptures and learned again the pervading truth in God's word of the principle of whole-heartedness.
[time=2353] God does not ask from us any half-hearted, almost wishy-washy commitment,
[time=2359] but He asks that we give to Him ourselves all that there is to have of ourselves at every and all times. Throughout the Old Testament, there are many reminders of the principle of the whole heart.
[time=2374] In Jeremiah 29-13 we're told, "If you shall seek for me you will find me when you search for me with your whole heart."
[time=2385] Psalm 42, 2 and 3 speaks of the desire we have for God in the following ways as the heart panted after the water brook, so panted my soul after the O God, my soul thirstest for the for the living God. Over and over again in the scripture, we are told that God expects from us a whole-hearted trust and commitment.
[time=2410] Now this may not seem to be more than just an elementary and familiar truth to all of us who have struggled with the will of God in our lives, but it is my experience and I believe it is the experience of most of God's people
[time=2425] that the first place we get into difficulty in discerning the will of God is that we do not really want to know nor to do God's will at any cost.
[time=2436] We want God's will mixed together with a little bit of our will.
[time=2441] We cannot pray the prayer of the Savior in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=2445] Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.
[time=2448] We cannot come to the decisions of life and to the direction of life and say to God, "I want to do your will and I don't care about what my will is
[time=2459] with my whole heart. I give myself to you.
[time=2462] Do with me as you please." Most of us have a footnote, and it's down at the bottom of the page, except I don't want to go to the mission field.
[time=2472] Except Lord, don't call me into any institutional ministry.
[time=2476] Lord, there are certain things in the church that I'd rather not do, but you have my whole-hearted and God says you violated the condition of my promise and I will not direct your path.
[time=2486] As long as we hold on to even a small portion of the reign of our life, the rest of Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 will not work.
[time=2494] James says a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways, and that's true.
[time=2499] When we want God's will with part of our lives and our will with the other part, God can't direct us, for he has not gained complete control and mastery of our lives.
[time=2510] And so the writer of Proverbs says that the first condition is this, positively we must trust in the Lord, negatively.
[time=2518] He tells us we are not to lean unto our own understanding.
[time=2523] Now that is not an excuse for us to divorce our mind from the principle of direction.
[time=2529] A lot of Christians I know seem to feel like once you accept Christ into your heart, you switch your mind to off, and you never again think.
[time=2537] I believe in the principle of the sound mind, and I believe that God can use a thinking Christian far greater than one who refuses to develop the faculties through education and instruction.
[time=2550] But the Word of God says we are to come to the place in our own lives where we understand the difference between letting God use the process of understanding and leaning upon our own understanding to make decisions.
[time=2563] The seventh verse of this chapter gives a commentary on that principle.
[time=2568] Verse seven says be not wise in thine own eyes.
[time=2573] Fear the Lord and depart from evil.
[time=2576] What does it mean to be wise in your own eyes?
[time=2579] It means to come to the decision making process in a matter of God's will and direction in your life.
[time=2586] And instead of casting yourself in total subjection to God,
[time=2593] you are leaning on your own understanding of the problem, and so rather than letting God direct your life,
[time=2599] you are figuring it out for yourself.
[time=2601] We are master manipulators as Christians.
[time=2604] We will not let God have full control because we have already figured out that after this step and the next step, the following step, we're going to be in trouble.
[time=2614] And the writer of Proverbs says to you and to me that if God is going to be the one to direct my life,
[time=2620] I have got to come to the place where even though I use the mind that God gives me and that he may use that mind to direct me, I will not put my weight for the decision solely upon my own understanding of the situation.
[time=2634] May I say to you this morning that if you decide in your own life that it's going to be you that figures things out,
[time=2642] you will never be where God wants you to be.
[time=2644] For there are times in the Christian experience when you look at the situation and if you do what is logical,
[time=2650] you'll do the wrong thing.
[time=2652] There is nothing very logical about many of the things that we together as a group of believers have done as a church.
[time=2659] If we had to come together in the times of decision for the growth and expansion of this ministry
[time=2665] and we had put all the facts on paper, we would have logically not done what we did.
[time=2670] But there was an element in that decision that we could not see with the eyes of the flesh
[time=2676] but which we could see with the eyes of faith and that was the element of God's will for our lives in that situation.
[time=2682] And so even though the circumstances would direct us this way, God directed us that way
[time=2688] and now we can look back upon it and we can say how blessed it is to walk in the will of God.
[time=2694] And those kinds of experiences are experiences that we face every day in our lives as Christians.
[time=2701] We are not to do what comes naturally, men and women, we are to do what comes supernaturally.
[time=2707] And that's why God says to us, "I'm willing to guide you and direct you, but you have to let me have my hands on the steering wheel and you have to take yours off."
[time=2721] The conditions are twofold, trust with all your heart and don't depend upon your own understanding.
[time=2730] Now I want you to notice the command.
[time=2732] The command is this, "In all thy ways acknowledge him."
[time=2738] Now as you know the book of Proverbs is a poetic book.
[time=2742] Quite often, truths are taught in the book of Proverbs and are repeated in different language for emphasis.
[time=2749] And for many years as these verses would come to my mind, I thought that the truth in all thy ways acknowledge him
[time=2756] was simply another way to state, trust the Lord and lean out to your understanding.
[time=2760] It just seems to say the same thing.
[time=2762] Until I began to look into the meaning of the word "acknowledge." And I was surprised and delighted to discover that here is a whole new truth that is not even touched upon
[time=2773] in the verses that go before it.
[time=2775] For the word "acknowledge" comes from a word which means to know, to be aware of, to be intimate with and to have fellowship with.
[time=2785] And the truth of this verse, "Men and Women" is as follows.
[time=2790] We are to come to the place where we are intimately sharing the life of Christ in our lives
[time=2797] and so acknowledging him and so living in touch with him in every area of our life
[time=2804] that is someone recently said to me, "I want to be in the place of God so that his very slightest and softest whisper will be heard in the ear of my spiritual being."
[time=2816] The truth of this verse is that God is not interested in just directing us at the moment of crisis that comes to our lives
[time=2824] when it's time to move or when there's an opportunity for promotion or when we're picking a mate for life or when some direction needs to be changed in our lives in terms of ministry.
[time=2835] God is interested in the crisis decisions, but this verse of Scripture tells us that he is also
[time=2841] and I believe far more interested in the day by day walk with God that so acknowledges him in our lives that he can make the slightest mid-course correction
[time=2852] and we are attuned to it.
[time=2854] Not just in the crisis, but in the day by day experience so acknowledging him
[time=2860] that he literally lives his life out through us and we are simply a body in which he walks around.
[time=2867] Now, the wonderful thing about this "Men and Women" is this, that if we grasp hold of the truth of verse 6, then the trauma of a crisis in verse 5 will never happen to us.
[time=2882] If I learn so to acknowledge Jesus Christ in my life every hour and every day,
[time=2888] there will be no major decisions in my life but a series of minor decisions that God uses to place me where he wants me to be.
[time=2897] And I will be able to see that all along the way he has been making slight changes to get me where he wants me to be.
[time=2904] And I will be in tune and in step with him because I am walking day by day
[time=2910] in the provision of his will.
[time=2912] Most of us are so capable of meeting the crisis, you know?
[time=2916] We can get ourselves pumped up when the big decision comes, we get out the Bible.
[time=2920] Write all the stuff down on a sheet of paper, put a column in the middle of pros and cons.
[time=2924] We've got it all figured out.
[time=2926] But what God wants "Men and Women" is for us to understand that he gives us a plan not just for the next ten years of our lives
[time=2933] but he's interested in the next ten minutes of our lives.
[time=2936] And he wants that will to become so much a part of us that it's just as natural as breathing in and breathing out.
[time=2944] I've known some folks in my life to whom I believe epitomized that truth.
[time=2951] And what I noticed about them was that it wasn't anything flashy or great, it just seemed to be a part of their life.
[time=2958] It was just the natural thing, just so low profile and all of that, but it just seemed to always know and be where God wanted them to be.
[time=2968] Because I believe they came to grips with this verse.
[time=2971] They learned how to acknowledge to know God in all of their ways.
[time=2976] Some years ago someone put in my hands a tract on how to know the will of God, which reminded me of the fact that God doesn't dole out his will in month size, year size or decade size packages.
[time=2988] And it's so very true that I want to share it with you because it illustrates wonderfully what I'm saying from this passage.
[time=2996] The poetry reads like this, "Why do I drift on a storm-tossed sea?
[time=3004] With neither compass nor star nor chart, when as I drift God's own plan for me waits at the door of my slow trusting heart.
[time=3014] Down from the heavens it drops like a scroll. Each day a bit will the master unroll.
[time=3021] Each day a might of the veil will he lift. Why do I falter? Why wander and drift?"
[time=3028] Drifting while God's at the helm to steer, groping when God lays the course so clear,
[time=3034] swerving those straight into port I might sail, wrecking when heaven lies just with inhale.
[time=3043] Help me, O God, in the plan to believe. Help me my fragment each day to receive.
[time=3052] O that my will may with thine have no strife, God yielded wills, find the God planned life.
[time=3061] Do you hear it? God wants to give it to us one fragment at a time, one day at a time, and when he does that will always be on course.
[time=3070] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lead not to thine own understanding in all thy ways.
[time=3077] Acknowledge him, and then here's the promise, and he will direct thy paths.
[time=3084] If you could read this in the original language it would read like this, and he will make straight your way.
[time=3090] God wants to keep you on the straight way, keep you out of the crevices and the crannies.
[time=3096] He wants to make straight your way. Let me share with you just a couple of things about this promise.
[time=3101] First of all, I want you to notice that this is God's promise to us of a personally guided tour through life.
[time=3108] A personally guided tour through life.
[time=3112] That means that God himself is the one who wants to take charge of my life. Notice the two pronouns.
[time=3118] He will direct thy paths. You bring the he and the thy together, and you have personal involvement with an almighty God.
[time=3127] He is my personal tour guide through the problems of this life.
[time=3133] He wants to be that. He will personally direct me, says the scripture.
[time=3137] Notice, secondly, that this is a promise that relates to every detail of my life.
[time=3143] Sometimes people say God isn't interested in the little things.
[time=3146] Listen, he says he will direct thy paths, plural, not just the pathway of ministry, not just the pathway of home life,
[time=3156] not just the pathway of matrimony, but all of thy paths. He's anxious to direct.
[time=3162] It includes every area of my life.
[time=3166] It's wonderful to see how when we put those things under control to the Holy Spirit, that promise takes hold.
[time=3174] Then notice that it is a promise of guidance that is infallible.
[time=3179] Paul writing to the Galatians said in the first chapter of Galatians that he conferred not with flesh and blood.
[time=3185] Every time I read that, I'm reminded of how easy it is for me to confer with flesh and blood before I confer with the Lord.
[time=3191] Isn't it amazing how we seek guidance and wisdom from everybody else except the one who is infallibly guaranteeing to us right wisdom?
[time=3200] And yet the Bible says that God wants to give us guidance. You know, my pastoral counsel isn't always right because I'm human.
[time=3208] Ken Nichols' psychological counseling isn't always right because he's human.
[time=3214] Parental counseling can be wrong because the human element is involved.
[time=3219] Counseling with one another involves humanity, so it may not always be right.
[time=3224] But men and women, when you get God's counsel, it's infallible. It is always right.
[time=3230] It is never wrong. It is always right on target for your life.
[time=3235] And God says that's what he wants to give me. He wants to give me his infallible directive for my life.
[time=3243] And there is such freedom in being there.
[time=3246] When the problems and difficulties come, what do I say?
[time=3249] Lord, I don't understand this, but you've got me here for a purpose.
[time=3253] I was amazed as I studied this third chapter to discover that in the very context he brings into the picture the chastening hand of God, verses 11 and 12, my son despised not the chastening of the Lord.
[time=3265] Neither be weary of his correction, for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth and scourgeeth every son.
[time=3270] What does that mean? That means that even as God has his hand heavy upon me to direct me and scourge me.
[time=3276] Even there I can know that his plan for my life is being unfolded, for it is an infallible plan of God.
[time=3284] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding, in all thy ways acknowledge him, and God promises that he will direct your path.
[time=3301] Along the Pacific coast is a winding waterway that goes in and out between high crevices of rock.
[time=3310] Archaeologists and geologists come to study that section because it is such a beautiful display of God's handiwork.
[time=3318] There is a tour boat that goes through the waterway, and I am told that when people come to ride on that tour boat, it is a very exasperating and frightening experience for many.
[time=3330] For visually, as you sit on the boat and are winding your way back through the rocks, it appears at times as if a collision into the high rock crevices is inevitable.
[time=3342] And the pilot of the boat never lessens his speed, but he pilots that ship back through those waterways, and I am told that there are o's and o's from the passengers as they narrowly miss what they are certain is a tragedy.
[time=3358] There is one special place in the midst of that journey where a high rocky craig rises up right in front, and the water seems to empty itself right into the rock.
[time=3370] The boat going full speed comes right toward that rock, and all of a sudden, at the last moment, the pilot turns, and opening up at that turn is the most beautiful expanse of waterway, any place in that whole area.
[time=3385] I am reminded that so often my life is like that. God is directing, and I see what is ahead, and it frightens me humanly.
[time=3394] And I want to get up there in the pilot seat and say, "Hey man, this is crazy, Lord. I don't want to have control of this thing. You don't know what you are doing."
[time=3402] But I am learning. I haven't learned it all yet.
