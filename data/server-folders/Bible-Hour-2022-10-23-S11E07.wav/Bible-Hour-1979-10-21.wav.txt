[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=29] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=59] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=78] We welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, all of you who are our special guests on this friend day who are gathered with us here in the auditorium for the Second Worship Service, and all of our friends who join us now by television here in Fort Wayne and in the other places where the Bible Hour is seen.
[time=95] We're grateful for the privilege of sharing this service with you, and it is our prayer that you will feel the warmth of our love for you as you worship with us, and that this will be a time of real blessing in your life.
[time=108] Right now we're going to listen to our choir as they sing under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger, a song which speaks of the foundation of this ministry, the Word of God.
[time=119] Please listen carefully to the words and music of this choir anthem.
[time=138] Thank you, and God bless you.
[time=163] Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless you.
[time=186] Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless you, and God bless you, and God bless you
[time=222] with us, and God bless you with us, and God bless you, and God bless you, and God bless
[time=249] you with us, and God bless you with us, and God bless you with us, and God bless you
[time=288] with us.
[time=294] Thank you, choir, for that ministry to our hearts, and the message of the song is as important as the melody, and we're thrilled by what we've heard.
[time=303] We're so grateful for music in this church.
[time=305] We believe that it's not a prelude to the ministry, it's a part of the ministry.
[time=310] God has wonderfully blessed us with some very, very uniquely gifted musicians as a part of this church. I want you to listen now to Alan Lenna Peterson as they sing a song that was specifically chosen for Friend Day. It reminds us that Jesus cares for us, and that's
[time=327] why we can care for each other.
[time=330] Take in your men, people, hands, oh, how Jesus cares.
[time=348] He cares when your trouble and the whole world seems wrong, he cares when the trials
[time=362] fire the silence, your song, he cares when you're lonely, though you laugh with the
[time=378] words of Jesus cares, Jesus cares, he cares when your heart makes.
[time=405] He cares when you stumble and the heat of the day.
[time=431] He cares when you're burdened and to weary, to pray, oh, and he cares when you fail
[time=445] him, when your feet go astray, Jesus cares, Jesus cares, he cares when your heart makes
[time=475] take in your many burdens, Jesus cares, he cares, he cares, he cares, he cares when you're
[time=532] I'm so glad that you join us on the Bible Hour today, and we thank you for the privilege of visiting with you in your home.
[time=539] It's a real joy for us as the Black Hawk Baptist Church and for Donna and I as leaders here to share with you each week the ministry of the Bible Hour, and we're just grateful that you join us and participate with us in this ministry.
[time=553] Before we share with you some announcements that have to do with the ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour, let me say that in recent days we've gotten a number of letters and phone calls from people who have expressed great concern that on occasion at the end
[time=566] of the service, the program does not get off the air so that you hear the end of the message.
[time=571] And I think that we have taken a look at that and we're working very diligently on it and I just want to make a commitment to all of you that to the very best of our ability from this point on, you'll be able to share the entire message.
[time=584] It is not always possible for us to extend beyond the hymn or beyond the prayer, but
[time=590] by the grace of God we're going to work it out so that the entire message is on the air and you can be a part of it each week.
[time=595] Donna, one of the things we've been sharing with our folks of recent dates has to do with the Daily Walk, a very special Bible study tool that frankly I'm very excited about because I sense the excitement of all the people who are involved in it.
[time=607] The Daily Walk is a way to read through the Scripture each year through the entire 66 books
[time=613] of the Bible and this little pamphlet that goes out each month has some very special features.
[time=620] One of the special features is that it has an overview of what you're going to be reading, it gives you the passage to read and then it gives a brief explanation of that particular
[time=630] portion of Scripture.
[time=631] For instance on the 5th of November the chapters which are being read are Acts chapters 10-12
[time=638] and at the front end of the book is an overview of those chapters and then a little chart that shows what's in each chapter and then after you've read the chapters there's a place for you to get some application for your own life.
[time=649] Your Daily Walk section of the booklet explains what those chapters can mean to you individually
[time=655] as you read each day.
[time=658] Now the Daily Walk is our gift to you and we'd like to send you the November issue right now if you'll just request it.
[time=665] When we send the issue to you we'll tell you how you can get this in your own home each month absolutely free as a part of the ministry of the Bible hour to you and we want you to
[time=675] know that the place where you write when you request the Daily Walk is.
[time=679] Right to pass your David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and just
[time=689] share with us that you have seen the broadcast and on what channel and that you would like to have your complimentary copy of the Daily Walk.
[time=697] And it'll be our privilege to share that with you just as soon as we receive your letter.
[time=702] Now the Daily Walk is something that we send automatically to all of our Founders Club members and as most of you know the Founders Club is a group of individuals and families who support the Bible hour regularly each month.
[time=714] Some of them for $10, some for $15, some for $25.
[time=717] We have several who give $100 a month for the support of the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=723] Now I want to go on record as saying that we're not asking you to take the monies that belong to your local church.
[time=727] I believe that your ties and offerings belong to the church where you attend.
[time=732] But ever so many folks have had an opportunity to give over and above what they give to their own local church to this television ministry because it touches them where they are.
[time=741] And then of course there are many folks who just don't have a church of their own and have seen fit to use what God has entrusted to them to help support this ministry.
[time=749] One of the best ways to do that is through the Founders Club, a regular monthly ministry to the Bible hour which makes it possible for us to keep on keeping on each week.
[time=759] Along with the daily walk there are some other benefits of the Founders Club that are very exciting that we share each month.
[time=766] I have a chance to send a letter to each one and why don't you share with them the little cards that we send out in the letters each month.
[time=773] We have what we call a watchword and it's on a little piece of not quite cardboard but
[time=779] heavy stock paper that you can sit on the windowsill over your sink or on your desk or by your bed stand and it's just an encouragement from the Word of God for that month.
[time=789] And we've chosen those verses very carefully to be an encouragement to everyone who gets them.
[time=794] Now if you're interested in becoming a part of the Founders Club once again you need to write to me Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=804] We'll send you all the information you need to share with us in the ministry of the Bible Hour through the Founders Club.
[time=810] This is the Founders Club Enrollment Time and we'd like to hear from you.
[time=814] Donna we have a sponsor today, someone who has sent in a special gift for the television ministry to underwrite the cost of this program as it's aired today in Fort Wayne and why don't you share with our friends who those sponsors are.
[time=828] Our sponsors for today are Carl and Edith Kay of Fort Wayne and they are sponsoring the
[time=834] Bible Hour in memory of Frank Sanders and they view the Bible Hour in Channel 21 here in Fort Wayne and we would say a special thank you today for your support of the Bible Hour.
[time=846] Donna before we go back to the service I want to remind all of our friends again that in just the next few days we'll be in almost all of the cities where the Bible Hour is seen in special television banquets here in Fort Wayne and South Bend, Indianapolis and
[time=859] Chicago and in Marion, Indiana and if you're interested in sharing one of our television banquets with us I hope you'll get in touch with us.
[time=867] Most of you who are on our mailing list have already received information about it and the two of us are looking forward to greeting many of our Bible Hour friends in these next days as we reach out and touch the lives of many people who are part of the Bible Hour family.
[time=880] Next week we will have a list of all of those banquets and whether to be held so that you can share with us if you haven't received the information already.
[time=887] Now once again we want to remind you that the Daily Walk, the special reading through the Bible manual and information about the Founders Club and the sponsors program is available
[time=898] to you through this address.
[time=900] Right to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and we'll
[time=911] be happy to get back to you the information that you request.
[time=916] John in just a moment I'm going to be preaching from the book of Mark a message on a man who
[time=922] was totally transformed by an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=927] I trust that all of our friends will stay with us as we open the word in a few moments and before we go back to the music and the other things that are happening in this Bible Hour program let me encourage you to covenant with us to pray daily for the Bible Hour.
[time=940] You may not be able to do anything else but you can all do that to pray daily that God will continue to bless this ministry as it reaches out.
[time=965] Thank you for the good singing you may be seated.
[time=968] We want you to listen now as the Black Hawk singers sing what should be on the prayer of our very believer's heart.
[time=975] I'm going to lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=978] I'm going to sing of my joys and seek joys and seek in.
[time=992] I'm going to tell them this song every day and every day.
[time=999] I'm going to lift up that wonderful name.
[time=1009] Well, I don't have reason to worry.
[time=1012] My name's I just can't afford.
[time=1020] I love that blessed name that one made higher than holy hell.
[time=1042] It was whispered I know my heart will blow through Jesus' bloodline.
[time=1049] I feel I'm going to lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=1056] I'm going to sing of my joys and seek joys and seek in.
[time=1062] I'm going to tell them this song every day and every day.
[time=1068] I'm going to lift up that wonderful name, I'm going to lift up that wonderful name.
[time=1077] Jesus, the whole house we play, Jesus, and every day we play.
[time=1087] I'm going to lift up that wonderful name, I'm going to lift up that wonderful name of
[time=1103] Jesus.
[time=1104] I'm going to sing of my joys and seek joys and seek in.
[time=1111] I'm going to tell them this song every day and every day.
[time=1117] I'm going to lift up that wonderful name.
[time=1122] I'm going to lift up that wonderful name, I'm going to lift up that wonderful name.
[time=1133] God precious name, it's Jesus.
[time=1147] Thank you Don and singers, I want you all to stand up if you will.
[time=1155] Let's all stand together.
[time=1157] We do not have many rituals at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, but one which we do have is the ritual of friendliness.
[time=1165] So I want you just to turn around wherever you are and get acquainted with four or five people right next to you and tell them you're glad they're in church today.
[time=1172] Will you do that?
[time=1173] Just take a moment right now.
[time=1174] Okay, that's very good.
[time=1197] Thank you.
[time=1198] You may be seated.
[time=1201] Some people will call that noise, but I think it's the sweetest sound, this side of heaven.
[time=1207] People talking to one another and getting acquainted and expressing love and friendship.
[time=1211] And we're glad you're here today and for the opportunity that we've had to greet you in this very simple way.
[time=1217] Each Sunday as we begin our telecast, we always sing the great hymn, "How Great Thou Art."
[time=1225] And we have become so accustomed to it, I thought perhaps people wouldn't miss it if we dropped it out of the early service, but we don't sing that in the early service.
[time=1232] And a lot of folks have come to say they wish we did, they wish we would sing it.
[time=1237] We don't have time to sing it again now, but we are going to listen to one of our soloist,
[time=1243] the pranoh, lenna peterson, as she sings for us the great hymn, "How Great Thou Art."
[time=1269] Oh, Lord, my God, when I am awesome, wonder, consider all the words thy hands have made.
[time=1283] I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder, thy power broad, you never displayed.
[time=1298] Then I sing, "My Son, My Savior, God, to thee, How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1347] When the true the words and the forest glades I wander, and hear the birds see sweet heat
[time=1360] in the trees, when I look down from walking on to pranoh, and hear the broken and feel
[time=1372] of creation for peace, then I sing, "My Son, My Savior, God, to thee, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1396] Then I sing, "My Son, My Savior, God, to thee, How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1437] Then I shall bow, in all bladderays, Lord, and their proclaim, My God, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1456] Then I sing, "My Son, My Savior, God, to thee, How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1501] How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art, How Great Thou Art,
[time=1515] (Applause)
[time=1528] Someone suggested that from now on we ought to just let her open the telecast, and we'd all listen, but we want to sing too, we just don't have all the equipment that she has to do it so well, we're grateful for that testimony and song.
[time=1542] I want you to open your Bibles with me this morning to the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament and the 10th chapter, Mark's Gospel, chapter 10.
[time=1554] And I want to read the last paragraph in that chapter, which begins with the 46th verse,
[time=1560] Mark chapter 10 verse 46.
[time=1563] Please follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1569] And they came to Jericho, and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Tameus, sat by the wayside begging.
[time=1579] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." And many charged him that he should hold his peace, but he cried the more a great deal, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
[time=1597] And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called.
[time=1601] And they called the blind man saying, "Be of good comfort, arise, he calleth thee."
[time=1607] And he casting away his garment rose and came to Jesus.
[time=1612] Jesus answered and said unto him, "What will thou that I should do unto thee?" The blind man said unto him, "Lord, that I might receive my sight." Jesus said unto him, "Go thy way, thy faith hath made thee well."
[time=1626] And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.
[time=1631] Now let us pray together.
[time=1633] Oh God in heaven, we come again into thy presence, and we ask at the outset of this teaching
[time=1639] part of the ministry that you will take these words and cause them to come alive to us as
[time=1645] we hear them and as we understand them.
[time=1648] Lord, we don't want to just know the story and understand its meaning, but we want to see how it applies to us, all of us who know Christ in a personal way, and all who are
[time=1660] still searching and seeking to know Him in such a way.
[time=1664] Put from our minds the thoughts of other things and pull the curtain on the cares of this world so that we might be able to contemplate and meditate and concentrate upon this truth.
[time=1676] Because we know that it is as the Word of God finds a place in our hearts that we can be transformed by the renewing of our minds.
[time=1684] Speak to each and every person here today as the message is heard in other places through the miracle of television.
[time=1691] We pray that lonely and hungry and seeking hearts will find their need met through the
[time=1697] ministry of thy Word today.
[time=1699] We thank you in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1705] This week I read an advertisement for a Christmas gift for children which has to be just about
[time=1715] the latest thing in individual giving.
[time=1719] There is a computer company in the eastern part of the United States which is offering to families of our generation the opportunity to send pertinent information about their child
[time=1730] and themselves and for a rather high fee they will be happy to take any of the old standard
[time=1737] nursery rhymes or storybook stories and take the main character rewriting the story around
[time=1745] the child's name that you happen to send.
[time=1748] So it is possible for your child to be the star of the story and if you choose to be
[time=1754] one of the attending characters you can have your name inserted into the record as well for a modest fee.
[time=1760] When you get the computer storybook back you have what you might call the most personalized
[time=1766] bedtime reading that has ever been known to man.
[time=1770] We often associate with computer companies the depersonalization of society.
[time=1776] But here is one company at least that is trying to take advantage of their technology to bring identity and individuality back into the home and back into the lives of people.
[time=1787] I am certain that all of us identify with the concept that we do not wish to be folded, stapled or mutilated even though we do live in a vast empire filled with people and individuals.
[time=1800] We are seeking each of us for our own meaning, for the meaning to our own person and for the meaning to life as we understand it.
[time=1808] We are looking for answers everywhere we can find them.
[time=1811] We do not like to be one of a group, just a number.
[time=1815] With these thoughts in mind I am encouraged greatly as I take in my hands this book we call the Bible and turn from page to page to find that God has not communicated His truth
[time=1826] in abstract terminology.
[time=1831] But He has chosen and I believe wisely so to teach us the truths we need to know through
[time=1837] telling us about flesh and blood people who lived in His day to whom He ministered and
[time=1843] in whose lives and in the story of whose lives are truths and principles and lessons that
[time=1853] will help each of us to find our way in life.
[time=1858] The record of the man about whom we have read today is one such episode.
[time=1863] The Bible says his name was Bartimaeus.
[time=1866] We do not know very much about his history except we can make some assumptions just by his name.
[time=1872] Where you see in the language of the Bible the word Bartimaeus is made up of two words.
[time=1877] The word bar which means son and the word Tameis which was the name of his father.
[time=1882] So Bartimaeus was one of those unnamed unknown people who was only known by the name of his
[time=1888] father.
[time=1889] He was the son of Tameis, in fact the record is almost filled with duplicity.
[time=1894] It says in the very same text that this Bartimaeus was the son of Tameis.
[time=1900] It is almost like doubling the statement.
[time=1902] The son of Tameis was the son of Tameis.
[time=1905] When anyone talked about this man they always said well yes that son of Tameis over there by the gate they didn't know his name.
[time=1913] Perhaps he was in the family of a very wealthy, prestigious man and because of the very famous father that he had he was known more by his father's name than by his own.
[time=1924] We do know this that he was a very lonely outcast man who was seeking for some identity in
[time=1930] his world.
[time=1932] He was like many people today with whom you and I fellowship from moment to moment each
[time=1938] day who feel like they have been swallowed up in a growing community where they have no personal meaning or identity.
[time=1946] Here was such a man and our Lord tells us a story about him so that we could understand
[time=1952] a truth that goes even beyond the truth of his physical healing.
[time=1957] I want us to notice some things about this man's predicament, the kind of situation that he had in life.
[time=1963] If for no other reason as we read about him we will stop for a moment to say a prayer of thanksgiving to God for all of our personal blessings.
[time=1970] He was a man who had a number of problems.
[time=1973] He was a man who was in a real bad way in his own life.
[time=1977] First of all we learned something of his helplessness.
[time=1980] The Bible tells us that this man Bartimaeus was at the gate of the city of Jericho begging for his living.
[time=1987] I have as you have I'm certain gone into some of the larger cities of our country and I remember one time in London England seeing this very same thing.
[time=1995] Men and women along the street sides with their tin cups out begging for enough money
[time=2001] so that they could buy bread to live on.
[time=2004] And as I have seen that site I have often wondered how far down I would have to go,
[time=2010] how desperate I would have to be in order to beg for my food.
[time=2015] And I don't know if I could say this with honesty because I'm sure we never know what it will be like until we're in that situation.
[time=2021] I think I'd do most anything for food for my family but if it were just for me I think I'd almost rather be dead than have to stand on the corner and beg.
[time=2031] You can get some picture of this man's helplessness as you realize that he had exhausted every
[time=2037] other possibility for subsistence.
[time=2039] There wasn't any other answer for him.
[time=2041] The only thing he had open to him was to stand at the gate and beg.
[time=2046] He was a helpless man.
[time=2049] But I have to believe that he was also a very hopeless man.
[time=2052] As I read this record I wonder how long he had been there and I also wonder how many people had passed him by.
[time=2058] Certainly many did as we often do.
[time=2060] We sort of turn our head the other way and walk past that one with our hand out.
[time=2066] I wonder how many doctors and healers and miracle workers of that particular time had
[time=2072] walked by that man not offering any hope to him in his situation.
[time=2079] I wonder how many.
[time=2081] As every day passed and the calendar unfolded before his eyes and his need continued to grow and he recognized that there was no hope apparently for him.
[time=2089] The feeling of hopelessness in his own heart began to grow and swell until he was at the
[time=2095] point where he was believing that nothing would ever happen to change his situation.
[time=2101] He was a helpless, hopeless, hungry man.
[time=2104] Oh yes, his hunger was because he did not have enough food to eat or he wouldn't have been begging but his hunger was in a different way as well.
[time=2114] His hunger was the hunger to be fulfilled in an area which he had never known fulfillment.
[time=2120] God had allowed him to be born into the world with all of the apparent apparatus for seeing.
[time=2127] He had the eye sockets and the apparent visual equipment to see but he could not see.
[time=2135] He had all of that which seemed to say to those who first saw him that he was like everyone else but there was something deep within him that gnawed at him every day and that is that the things people talked about around him which they saw with their eyes he had never seen.
[time=2150] He had a hunger to see and he could not see.
[time=2153] He had a desire to fix his eyes upon the beauty of the world and he could not for the scripture
[time=2159] says he was blind.
[time=2162] This man in his need is a picture of all of us before we come to know Christ.
[time=2168] In his physical blindness he pictures those of us who are spiritual blind.
[time=2174] The Bible says that the God of this world has blinded the minds of those that believe
[time=2180] not lest the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ should shine upon them and show them the way.
[time=2187] The Bible says that until Christ comes to live within the heart of a man he as spiritually is just as blind as this man was physically and all of those things which are a part of
[time=2198] this man's physical blindness carry over into the spiritual blindness of a man without God.
[time=2205] First of all a helplessness how many times I've talked with people who've said preacher I've tried everything in the world to find meaning for my life.
[time=2211] I've been the whole route drugs and sex and prestige and power and money and all the rest
[time=2217] and I do it all but when I get all done there's still that emptiness in my heart.
[time=2222] I don't understand they say how people can get anything spiritually meaningful in their lives. I do everything they do but somehow there's still that hunger within me that's not being satisfied.
[time=2232] This past week we had a meeting in our church of many of the people who have just come to know Christ in a personal way and some who are coming into our fellowship as new members and I ask in that meeting around the circle how did you happen to come here to church and how did you happen to come to know Christ and there was a consistent theme throughout every answer it was this I had a hunger in my life I had a need that was not being met.
[time=2257] There was an emptiness that I couldn't find the answer to there was something missing in my life that was the situation of this blind man and sad to say it's the situation of countless
[time=2266] numbers of people today spiritually who go to church who do all of the outward things
[time=2272] who understand what's going on all around them and yet it's as if they were living in another world because that deep emptiness within them is still there.
[time=2282] Here was a man who was helpless and hopeless and hungry but before we look at his encounter
[time=2288] with the Lord Jesus let me share with you one other detail about his life he was a man who even though he wanted to get the problem solved was being hindered by others there's a very very sad story here that goes along with the story of his healing for when this
[time=2304] man began to cry out for the Lord Jesus to come and heal him we read in verse 48 that there were many around him that charged him that he should hold his peace they said to
[time=2315] him Bartimaeus just keep quiet son hey just don't bother this man he's busy he's on his way to more important things Bartimaeus you've been blind all these years there's probably nothing ever going to change that so why don't you just keep quiet and sit down there and go on with your begging there's no time for you to be involved with this man.
[time=2333] I had someone tell me this week that a young boy had wanted to know Christ in a personal
[time=2342] way he'd gone to a meeting where he'd heard the gospel and he came home very excited about it and told his mother and his mother said to him son you don't want to be a part of all that foolishness that Jesus Christ business you better stay away from those folks they'll turn you into a religious fanatic you don't want to get too involved with those those people over there because if you do you'll you'll be changed and you won't be a normal healthy human being and the one thing that could have helped him his friends were saying stay away from it stay away from it I have to believe that someone who so endangers the spiritual welfare of a little one like that will someday give a great account to the Lord for having
[time=2380] been the hindrance that kept them perhaps from knowing God here was a man who had a great need but even his friends weren't trying to help him help him meet that need and then one day the Lord Jesus came to Jericho the scripture tells us he was on his way to the triumphal entry into the city he was ultimately on his way to the cross to give his life for
[time=2399] the ransom for many but as his entourage came to Jericho somehow through the crowd the news
[time=2405] of his coming buzzed around until this beggar heard it and he and he heard the word Jesus is coming Jesus of Nazareth is on his way I don't know how Bartimaeus knew about him but perhaps as he had been at the gate and heard the conversation of travelers from all over that area he had heard of the resurrection of Lazarus he had heard of Jairus daughter he had heard of all the great miracles this Jesus had wrought and perhaps he had thought in his own heart as he had many hours of meditation open to him perhaps someday this Jesus of
[time=2434] Nazareth will come to Jericho if he ever comes here I hope I'll have the opportunity to get next to him maybe he can do for me what no one else has ever been able to do and so that day as he heard the word filter down through the people Jesus is coming Jesus is coming the scripture says that he cried out he had to have known something about Jesus
[time=2456] for he did not just call him master or teacher he called him the son of David he personally
[time=2462] believed in his own heart that this one was the Messiah and so he cried out Jesus of Nazareth thou son of David have mercy on me have mercy on me and even though his friends told him
[time=2474] to shut up and keep quiet and don't be an embarrassment to us he kept on crying the scripture says the more they hindered him the louder he louder he shouted they said shut up Bartimaeus and he shouted louder I want to see Jesus some of the most beautiful words in all of the scripture are recorded in Jesus response for the scripture says as he came close to the city and he heard the cry of Bartimaeus and the word filtered down to him that Bartimaeus wanted to see him notice what the text says the Bible says Jesus stood still whenever I
[time=2508] read that I am reminded how unlike the Lord so many of us are and yours truly included
[time=2516] a man set on heavy business in front of him this was the purpose for which he had come to go to the cross and die he was about to be inaugurated in his public identification in the city the triumphal entry was just ahead of him and yet in the midst of all of that
[time=2532] busyness the cry of one lonely helpless hopeless hungry beggar came to his ears and the scripture
[time=2538] said Jesus Christ stood still he was awaiting saviour may I say to you that there are times
[time=2548] in our lives when we have such deep needs and we're in such a hurry and it seems as if we're on a tram we can't get off of and the world is rushing by and we're caught up with it and we wonder does anybody know who I am does anybody really care if I cry out of the
[time=2564] need of my heart will anybody listen and if they hear will they be able to do anything about it I want to say to you there is one in heaven who always is willing to wait for
[time=2574] the hungry crying soul if they reach out to him it's the waiting saviour but notice he wasn't just willing to wait he was willing to do something about it the scripture says in verse 49 that Jesus stood still and he commanded that Bartimaeus be called the Bible
[time=2590] says that Jesus Christ is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance when Jesus heard that this man had a need he said to the people around him
[time=2601] bring Bartimaeus to me I want to help him and he called him and brought him and I'm reminded of that great invitation in the New Testament that says come unto me all ye that labour and our heavy laden and I will give you rest the Bible tells us that we have a waiting willing saviour who reaches out to us in our need at the moment of our
[time=2622] despair and he encourages us to come to him to find our spiritual need met I want you
[time=2629] to notice that not only did he find a willing and waiting saviour but he found a saviour
[time=2636] who could work the work in his life that needed to be done there's an interesting side light
[time=2643] in this story and every time I read the story I marvel at all of the truth that's couched
[time=2649] in these words when Bartimaeus was brought to the Lord Jesus and he was standing in front of him Jesus asked him the most curious question he said Bartimaeus what can I do for you in
[time=2662] the language of the Bible what will that I should do for the what will thou that I should do for thee now when you read that you don't pause for a moment to think about it but just let me ask you this question does that not seem an absurdity here's the man who for all of these days has been at the gate begging he is obviously blind he probably stumbled
[time=2682] his way to the saviour leaning on a walking stick and and having people help him and he stands there with the scales of a lifelong blindness upon his upon his face and that kind of empty stare which often comes with blindness and he stands in the presence of the almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus says to him Bartimaeus what can I do for you I'm certain that the Lord didn't ask that question so that he could find out what
[time=2708] Bartimaeus wanted but it dawned on me that the reason he asked Bartimaeus what can I
[time=2714] do for you is because he wanted to hear Bartimaeus say this is my need here's my need Lord that
[time=2722] I might receive my sight it is an interesting thing to me how many people there are who in
[time=2729] the quietness and loneliness of their own hearts in the moments when they're alone and no one is around recognize intuitively a deep spiritual need in their hearts but if someone
[time=2742] says to them do you have a spiritual need it's the hardest thing in the world for them to verbalize it they can't quite say I've got spiritual blindness what will thou that
[time=2754] I should do for thee the saviour says to you and what do you answer do you have the courage
[time=2760] of a Bartimaeus who says Lord that I might receive my sight I'm spiritually blind I need Christ that I might receive my sight he found the saviour waiting and willing and working
[time=2775] for him Jesus did for Bartimaeus what Bartimaeus could not do for himself what happened as
[time=2782] the result of his encounter with Jesus is a very interesting story the Bible says that
[time=2789] when Jesus encountered him and he heard that Bartimaeus wanted to receive his sight Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee well the thing that we learn about this
[time=2803] man's healing is a very important truth as it relates to salvation spiritually and that is that it's a matter of faith it had to have been faith on the part of Bartimaeus for he could not say for certain that it was Jesus Christ who was standing there by him he had never seen him he could not know that how did he know to do what Jesus said to him he believed out of his heart that this was the Christ who was speaking to him and on the basis of his faith he acted every once in a while people say to me well I'm not going to do
[time=2833] what the Lord says to me until I can demonstrate scientifically that it's true well you will
[time=2839] wait for a long time because the whole principle of spirituality is the principle of faith if
[time=2845] it's a matter of that which you can ascertain in the test tube in the science lab then it's not a faith matter at all it's a matter of reason of rationality but the Bible says were to trust God and believe him and the world is filled with living examples of men and women
[time=2860] who have believed and on the basis of their faith God has done a miraculous work in their life you say how did Bartimaeus get enough faith to believe to do what Jesus said well
[time=2872] probably he'd heard about all the other people that Jesus had healed and helped and he had heard that they had responded in faith and that their lives had been changed and on the basis of that he believed and he exercised faith and even in this auditorium today among
[time=2887] our friends are many who have put their trust in Jesus Christ and have believed in their lives have been transformed how did it happen it happened because one day they took the word of God this book by faith and believed it and they accepted it and God did a work
[time=2902] in their life now the thing that happened to Bartimaeus was instantaneous the Bible says
[time=2908] and immediately he received his sight the Lord didn't say now Bartimaeus this week I'm going to be holding 12 classes on how to better use your eyesight I'd like to register you for these classes and if you'll come faithfully every night by the end of the week we might be close to getting this thing together Bartimaeus didn't need any he didn't need any classes
[time=2927] reformation wouldn't help him he didn't have the equipment he needed some new equipment in his life so that he could see and the world today is telling us that if we'll just reform everybody and we'll just have some classes and educate and all the rest of it that somehow that'll do it but you see men and women as it relates to God until Christ comes to live within us we don't have the equipment we don't have the equipment to to relate to God until Jesus Christ comes to live within us we don't need classes men and women we need conversion
[time=2959] we need Christ and that's what happened to Bartimaeus instantaneously he was healed and
[time=2966] he began to walk with the Lord now his situation was changed immediately and the effects of
[time=2974] it were immediate I was reading this week the story of one of our great hymn writers Fanny
[time=2980] Crosby some of you know about Fanny Crosby many of the hymns that we sing in our hymn book were written by this godly lady she was a blind woman and yet through her blindness
[time=2992] she had great insight into spiritual truths and we sing her hymns every week one day someone came to Fanny Crosby and said to her Miss Crosby if you could do it all over again and you had one wish and God would grant that wish what would it be she said well I would wish that I would be born blind and the man was startled and he said I mean after all of these years
[time=3013] of enduring this blindness if you had it to do over again you would wish that you would be born blind and she said you fail to understand that now that I'm as old as I am and I've
[time=3023] lived all of this life she said I have won one privilege ahead of me that none of you will ever know and he said what is that she said the first time I opened my eyes I will
[time=3035] see Jesus Christ face to face the first time sight comes to these eyes my first view will
[time=3041] be of the Savior and she said I don't want anybody to take that privilege away from me I'm looking forward to my eyes focusing for the first time upon the Son of God did you
[time=3052] ever stop to think about the fact that the first thing Bartimaeus ever saw in his life was the face of the dear Savior who healed him I believe that's a sight he never forgot
[time=3062] in fact over in the book of Luke in the other account of this record we're told that when he received his sight that he followed the Lord and he glorified God and all the people
[time=3073] when they saw what had happened to him gave praise unto God I've watched that happen over and over again as men and women have come spiritually blind without the equipment to know God and they have come to accept what this book says receiving Jesus Christ as their personal Savior inviting him into their life and immediately their lives have been transformed
[time=3094] and their whole outlook on everything has changed and they've gone forth from that experience into newness of life and even the people who work with them and their friends and their and all of their associates have said what in the world has happened to Jane to marry to Tom what's happened to them they're different and they have glorified God this man Bartimaeus
[time=3118] gives to us all of the ingredients that are necessary if we in our spiritual weakness
[time=3124] are to know God as clearly and as carefully as I can identify them they're these first of all if a man is to become a Christian and to know Christ personally like Bartimaeus he must recognize his need Bartimaeus knew that he was blind he verbalized it he recognized
[time=3139] it one of the problems that many people have in our world today in coming to faith in Christ is they're not willing to recognize that they have a need oh I can do all right by myself I'm not so bad I'm not as bad as so and so and such until you can come to the place in
[time=3154] your life that you will recognize you have a deep spiritual need there's not anything God can do for you secondly Bartimaeus realized his own inability to meet that need he knew
[time=3165] that wasn't anything he could do for his blindness if there had been he would have done it perhaps he had tried all of the potions of his day the phylacteries and all of the healers and everything and all of the waters and the pools and everything he had tried it all but he knew there wasn't anything he could do to help himself and to change his situation he was at the very bottom of the barrel and he said there's not anything I can do for me I'm not able to meet that need men and women until you come to the place spiritually where you recognize that in human flesh and in energy that you can muster up yourself there's not
[time=3196] anything you can do about your spiritual need God can't help you he recognized his need
[time=3202] and he realized his inability to meet that need himself thirdly he reached out by faith
[time=3209] to the one who could meet the need Jesus Christ he put himself in the hands of the one who
[time=3217] can make the difference Jesus Christ he did it by faith he said Lord in essence I've come
[time=3224] to the end of myself there's not anything I can do for myself and so I quit trusting
[time=3230] in Bartimaeus and now I put my trust in Jesus Christ I put my life in your hands Lord you
[time=3236] do for me what I can't do for myself and you know that's what happens every time someone comes to Christ that's the spiritual transaction that takes place when a person is born again
[time=3245] they come to the place where they recognize that they cannot save themselves and they by personal faith just come to God and say Lord I know I'm a sinner I know I can't save myself and so I put myself in your hands and Lord Jesus you do for me what I can't do for
[time=3261] myself then fourthly he not only reached out to Christ by faith but he responded to the
[time=3267] instruction of the Savior the Lord Jesus said Bartimaeus go your way your faith has made
[time=3274] you whole the Lord Jesus says to us come unto me believe on the Lord Jesus Christ with all
[time=3282] thine heart and thou shalt be saved and he would say to all of us today who do not know
[time=3288] Jesus Christ in a personal way who are blind spiritually he is saying to us come unto me by faith and I will receive you accept me as your Savior and I will give you life and
[time=3300] newness and he will do it today he did it for Bartimaeus one day at the age of 17 he did
[time=3306] it for me he's done it for many and God knows he'll do it for you if you'll just ask him
[time=3313] to shall we pray together with our heads bowed and our eyes closed before we conclude the
[time=3320] service let me ask this question do you have a need do you recognize it are you willing
