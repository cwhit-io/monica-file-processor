[time=0] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=25] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=30] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=57] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=60] - We welcome you to the Second Worship Service held here in the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=67] on this the Lord's Day.
[time=70] We're grateful for all of you who are present with us in the service and the many of you who have joined us now by television.
[time=75] We trust that this will be an hour of blessing and encouragement, an hour that will strengthen you and your inner man and make you to be more like Christ because you've been exposed to His truth.
[time=87] We're happy to have as our special guest throughout this hour, Mr. Mike Coyle, an outstanding French horn player, vocalist, and he'll be singing for us in a few moments.
[time=97] Right now, our choir is going to remind us of one of the most familiar texts in all of the Word of God, John chapter 3, verse 16, as they share with us a musical rendition of
[time=107] "For God So Love the World."
[time=128] And through so whether we live within Him, or so whether we live within Him, shall not
[time=150] live within Him, shall not live within Him, shall not live within Him, shall not live
[time=213] into the world to again the world, but that the world through in mind be saved, the world
[time=233] through in mind be saved, more God so love the world that He gave His only me but in
[time=254] Him, shall not live within Him, shall not live within Him, shall not live within Him
[time=278] as in my life, ever as in my life, ever as in my life.
[time=306] Thank you, choir.
[time=307] We love that verse when we read it, when we quote it, and we'd love to hear it in music.
[time=313] We're happy to have with us in our services both this morning and again this evening Mr.
[time=317] Mike Coyle.
[time=318] I did not know much about Mike before Don Kruger introduced him to me.
[time=322] He is one of the top French horness in the country.
[time=326] He has played with a number of the great symphonies.
[time=329] I've discovered in the early service that he's also a very excellent vocalist and he's going to be ministering to us now please listen carefully and share the heart of music from our guest Mr. Mike Coyle.
[time=363] [MUSIC - 165 seconds]
[time=557] We're so very grateful that you joined us on this edition of the Bible Hour and we have a great deal to communicate to you during this segment of our telecast.
[time=565] We were talking just a moment ago wondering how in the world we would say everything we want to say in these few moments that we have when we step aside from the regular morning service but let's jump right in Donna and I think we ought to start with your sharing a very important letter we received this week from someone that God gave us the opportunity to minister to.
[time=585] This lady writes to us, "I have just recently moved to Roanoke since the death of my husband.
[time=590] We were on your mailing list when we lived in Cherubasco.
[time=594] Your messages brought hope and comfort to me during his year-long bout with cancer and she goes on to say that she wants to join the Founders Club so that she can support the ministry on a regular basis because it's had such an important part in her life.
[time=608] Whenever I hear that I'm reminded that that one person represents a great number of folks that we don't ever hear from and it encourages me to know that the Bible hour is touching people where they live in the midst of their routine life and in the midst of their difficult
[time=622] life and it's just an encouragement to know that we're there week after week to touch people and encourage them through the ministry of the Word of God.
[time=629] One of the tools that God has given us beside the tool of television is the tool of literature
[time=635] and during the past few weeks we have been offering to all of our Bible hour family a little booklet called "The Answer Book." It is simply a compilation of the scriptures and there's a very interesting section in that booklet on the subject of comfort.
[time=648] I had the opportunity to use this book this week in my own personal ministry as I shared the scripture with a sorrowing couple who had lost a loved one and then I gave a copy of the book to them so that they could take it with them on a long journey to say a final farewell to someone they loved a great deal.
[time=665] This booklet is something we would like to put in the hands of every single person who watches the Bible hour. It's absolutely free and we'd love to send it to you this week.
[time=674] Donna, how do they get involved in this free gift?
[time=677] If you would like to have your free copy of the answer book, all you need to do is write to Pastor David Charlemiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is
[time=690] 46815. During the last few weeks we have been planning a very special time in the ministry
[time=698] of the Bible hour for the very first time to go into every area where the Bible hour is seen with an opportunity to meet all of our family and friends who are part of the Bible hour family. And Donna, we have six television banquets that we'll be starting very soon and we ought to tell our folks at home where these banquets are going to be held and how they can be included and how we would have an opportunity to meet with them.
[time=719] The first one is going to be held here in Fort Wayne on Saturday, November the 10th at 715.
[time=724] It will be held at the Marriott Inn.
[time=727] On Monday, November 12th we will be having one in South Bend, Indiana at 7 p.m. in the
[time=733] Century Center.
[time=734] And then on Tuesday, November the 13th at 7 p.m. will be in Chicago at the Oak Lawn Tower
[time=741] Inn which is located in Oak Park, Illinois.
[time=745] And then we'll be at Marion College in Marion, Indiana on Thursday, November 15th at 7 p.m.
[time=752] On Friday night, November the 16th, we will be back here in Fort Wayne again at the Imperial House at 7 p.m.
[time=759] On November 17th, we'll be going to Indianapolis to the Hilton at the Circle at 6.30 p.m. on
[time=765] November 17th.
[time=767] And Donna, if the folks at home are interested in being a part of one of these banquets, the best way for them to do that at this point in time is to call us here at the church office.
[time=776] And one of our secretaries will put them in touch with the reservation coordinator so that they can be included in that night of fellowship.
[time=782] It promises to be a great night.
[time=783] We're going to be premiering a new audio-visual presentation of the history and development of the Bible hour and what God is doing through it as well as introducing some of our favorite Bible hour musicians.
[time=794] Have a time of wonderful fellowship around the table and encouragement in the things of the Lord and we'd love to have you with us for one of these nights when we come to your area.
[time=804] Once again, the telephone number that you should call is area code 219-749-8524.
[time=811] When you call that number, ask for information on the television banquets and you'll be put in touch with the right people.
[time=816] Now, before we go back to the morning service, we have a number of folks that we need to introduce to our family at large who have helped us on this particular broadcast by being a sponsor or an associate sponsor.
[time=828] Don, I think we ought to just go through these folks and name them and let them know of our appreciation for what they've done.
[time=834] First of all, we are being sponsored today by Thomas Lebensorger who watches the Bible
[time=841] hour on Channel 38 in Chicago.
[time=845] Also on Channel 38 in Chicago is Harlan Webster and he is a co-sponsor today.
[time=852] Along with these two, we have Mr. and Mrs. Arlo Marr Sr. who watched the television program here in Fort Wayne on Channel 21 and their Founders Club members.
[time=861] And Harry Long also is a Founders Club member and he watches on Channel 21.
[time=866] Also from Fort Wayne, Pauline Hostetler who is a Founders Club member.
[time=872] Mrs. Becky Rumble also watches on Channel 21.
[time=876] And then Channel 46 in South Bend, Indiana, we have Mr. Leonard Amstutz who is a Founders
[time=882] Club member and is supporting the ministry today as an associate sponsor.
[time=887] We also have Claude and Edna Smith who view Channel 40.
[time=892] And last but not least, Mr. Ralph Franks who is a Channel 21 viewer and is a co-sponsor on today's program and Don and I both say a hearty thank you to you folks for your help in making today's program possible.
[time=905] You're a great encouragement to us.
[time=906] We love you in the name of the Lord.
[time=908] We thank you for what you've done.
[time=910] Don, there's a number of folks who would be interested in knowing what's involved in being an associate sponsor and that information is available from the Bible Hour Office.
[time=918] They will just write and ask us for it.
[time=920] We want to encourage you if you're interested in working with us and helping to sponsor the ministry of the Bible Hour to write to our office and ask for information on the sponsor's program.
[time=930] And we also want to encourage you if you haven't done so already to sit down today and write us a note and request your free copy of the answer book.
[time=937] We'd be also happy to send it to you free and post each page when you write to us this week.
[time=943] We encourage you as many as possible to send a gift to help in the ministry of television as you're able to do it.
[time=949] But we want you to know that the gift offers of literature are yours without any obligation.
[time=954] If you're not able to send a gift, we'll be happy to send it to you anyway.
[time=957] Once again, before we go back to the morning service, why don't you tell them how to get in touch with us here at the Bible Hour Office.
[time=964] Our mailing address is Reverend David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=973] 46815.
[time=974] And we do hope that we'll hear from you this week.
[time=978] Don, in just a few moments, I'm going to be opening the Bible to the Old Testament book of Isaiah to share the last in a series of messages on the promises from God's Word and one that is very appropriate for some experiences we have had in our church family this week.
[time=991] God's promise of peace in the midst of the storm.
[time=994] And I think that this passage of Scripture from Isaiah 26 will be a great encouragement to many of our friends who watch at home, and we encourage you to have your Bibles ready to join us in just a moment.

[time=1292] [MUSIC]♪ [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=1309] Thank you, Mike. We'll hear from him in just a moment, but before he comes back to sing again, I want to remind all of you that we're reading through the Bible this year, and many of you have just about completed the month of October, if not, you should be catching up quickly.
[time=1324] And I want you to know that if you haven't already received it, the November issue of the Daily Walk is on its way. It is a plan to read through the Scripture in a year.
[time=1332] Now, I shouldn't tell you this, because it'll make some of you lazy, but if you missed the first month, you can jump in where we are and still go through the whole cycle and catch up next November.
[time=1342] And some of you who thought you were going to start out well and you didn't make it too well, you'd like to start over in November. I guess that's all right, too.
[time=1350] But we want you to be reading the Bible, and I think that will have a tremendous impact on us as individuals, on our lives.
[time=1356] We want to extend this opportunity not only to all of you who are here in the building as a part of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and its friends, but to all of our many friends who watch by television.
[time=1366] If you'd like to join us in reading through the Bible, if you'll just drop a note to us and request it, we'll send you a copy of the Daily Walk so that you can walk through the Scriptures with us and read the Scripture each day.
[time=1377] It'll be meaningful in your life and strengthening to your own heart. Now, just before the message, Mike is going to come back and minister to us again.
[time=1407] When I come to that river, at ending of day, when the last winds of sorrow have blown,
[time=1427] there'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
[time=1443] I won't have to cross Jordan alone. Jesus died for my sins to atone.
[time=1459] When the darkness I see, he'll be waiting for me. I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
[time=1476] I won't have to cross Jordan alone. Jesus died for my sins to atone.
[time=1492] When the darkness I see, he'll be waiting for me. I won't have to cross Jordan alone.
[time=1522] Thank you, Mike. Will you open your Bibles with me to the Old Testament and the Book of Isaiah and the 26th chapter?
[time=1537] Isaiah chapter 26. While you're finding your place in the Scripture, let me say by way of introduction that there is no way that you can plan a service
[time=1549] so that all of the elements fit together exactly in the fashion that God the Holy Spirit would so desire.
[time=1557] There are occasions when our services seem to be planned by somebody outside of ourselves with the purpose of God's ministering to hearts in a special way.
[time=1568] Few of you are aware of the events of this past week which have caused us to be deeply identified with at least three families in our acquaintance who have gone through some difficult times.
[time=1582] Our fellow pastor here in the city Roy Clark who laid to rest his beloved wife succumbed to cancer and we attended that service this week and saw the glory of God in the lives of those Christian people.
[time=1595] And then this same week we learned that one of our own number, a young girl who was serving God with the navigators in Bloomington had succumbed again to the disease of leukemia and gone home to be with the Lord.
[time=1608] And just as we were putting together the plans to get with those folks, we received a phone call from another one of our members whose mother-in-law had been tragically killed in a car accident in Minnesota.
[time=1622] Through all of these experiences, we have been quite aware of the fact that God was directing us to the final message in the promises of the Old Testament contained in the words of this great chapter.
[time=1634] Then as we listened to the message of music today, we were reminded of the great experience that our friends have had when they have been face to face with the Lord.
[time=1645] And we have been reminded of the tremendous truth of the love of God for us and that he sent his only son into the world to make sure that we never perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1656] We have been encouraged with the words of Psalm 27 that in the midst of these difficulties, the Lord is my light and my salvation of whom then shall I be afraid.
[time=1667] And then just before we are to read the Scripture, we are encouraged to remember that when that moment comes for all of us to pass from this life into the next, it won't be a journey of solitude, but it will be a journey when the Lord goes with us will not have to face that alone.
[time=1684] And now we turn to the text, which is Isaiah chapter 26, mainly verse 3, but we shall also read verse 4.
[time=1693] Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee.
[time=1701] Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the Lord God is everlasting strength.
[time=1708] Shall we pray together?
[time=1710] Father, it is in such a time as this when the experiences of our lives cause the truth of God's Word to be deeply embedded in our hearts, that we learn perhaps more of the meaning of God's Word than at any other time.
[time=1726] For some strange reason you have brought the truth of the Word of God and the experiences of life together in a very unique and special way.
[time=1734] And then today, through the sensitivity of our brother to the Spirit of God, have used the ministry of music to further prepare our hearts for the truth which we are about to receive.
[time=1745] Lord, we recognize that all of us are not alike touched by the experiences which we have mentioned, but it is true that should the Lord Terry and his coming, each of us, will someday, perhaps soon or late, face the same kinds of challenges to our own lives and souls.
[time=1763] And so it would deem us wise to prepare our hearts through the input of God's Word today, speak to us through the Scripture that we may understand, that we may receive, and that we might be prepared for that which you have for us in these days ahead in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1784] In all of the situations which I have enumerated for you, there has been one consistent quality which I have not been able to miss nor avoid.
[time=1793] I attended the memorial service of Maxine Clark on Friday night, and the pastor who was her husband stood at the end of the service to give thanks to all of those who had been an encouragement to her and to the family, and shared the joy and victory which God had given in the midst of the deepest sorrow perhaps that man can know in this life.
[time=1816] I visited with a young man who just lost his wife, and he shared with me the victory that God had given him in the midst of this, and also told me of the experience of Rhonda who as she passed out of this life into the next was quoting the Word of God that she had memorized and had committed to her own heart.
[time=1839] I stood in a home with a couple who lost someone very near and dear to them and shared with them the victory that is ours in the Lord Jesus Christ and especially the words of 2 Corinthians chapter 1 which tell us that when we need to be comforted of God, it is from the comfort we receive from him that we then are able to comfort others.
[time=1862] In all of these situations it was quite evident to me that there was a quality of peace which passes understanding.
[time=1870] Now let me say that this was not just an attempt on the part of these individuals to quiet the tension which was within them. Quiet tension is not trust.
[time=1879] It was not compressed anxiety that they were not letting be seen on the surface.
[time=1885] Too often we think we are trusting when we are just controlling our panic.
[time=1890] Trusting is not a good acting job. Trusting is a deep, resilient quality from within that is not explainable in human terms.
[time=1899] True faith and true trust not only gives us a calm exterior but it also gives us a very quiet heart.
[time=1907] The secret to that kind of trust and peace is found within the passage we have read for you today.
[time=1914] Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee.
[time=1920] I want you to notice that this passage of Scripture in its context was given during Israel's darkest hour.
[time=1927] It was a promise that seemed to have little perspective for those who walked in the day of Isaiah the prophet.
[time=1933] And yet it was a promise given with great meaning and it was a true promise and a promise that could be understood and experienced by everyone who received its words.
[time=1943] It is a truth that runs consistently throughout the word of God.
[time=1948] We turn just but a few pages in the book of Isaiah to the 30th chapter and we discover that it is found again in just a very simple formula that God has given to us.
[time=1958] Isaiah chapter 30 and in verse 15 and this is what we read in that text,
[time=1964] "In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength." That is that deep peace of heart which God promises to those who will follow his plan.
[time=1975] Now I want you to notice several things about this particular text.
[time=1979] First of all I want you to notice the promise of peace in the midst of the storm.
[time=1984] God promises here a very special kind of peace. It is called perfect peace.
[time=1990] Now the dictionary defines peace as the condition of freedom from disturbance within the soul.
[time=1997] Perfect harmony reigning within according to the dictionary.
[time=2002] The Hebrew word for peace may be the only Hebrew word some of you know.
[time=2007] You may have said it not knowing what you are saying. It is the word shalom.
[time=2011] And the Hebrew word shalom has a very interesting meaning.
[time=2014] It means the soundness of health.
[time=2018] And so the word peace has with it to be spiritually healthy to be free from emotional and spiritual disease to be free from all discord within the soul.
[time=2029] Peace is the freedom from division of soul.
[time=2033] It is the integrated spirit within man that has everything in control.
[time=2040] And the Bible says that God wants to give that kind of peace to all who will come to receive it.
[time=2047] Now some of you may be asking I wonder if I have that peace in my own heart and in my own life.
[time=2053] Let me give you a quick way to discern it.
[time=2056] There is no peace like that in the heart of a person where the heart is filled with jealousy or envy.
[time=2064] There is no such thing as peace mixed with discontent, peace that is brought together with temper or selfishness
[time=2072] or pride or intolerance or harsh criticism or fear or anxiety.
[time=2078] Peace does not mix with any of these qualities more than water mixes with oil.
[time=2084] Peace is a quality which dispels all of those characteristics and reigns in its stead to give meaning and purpose and direction and stability to the life of the person in whom such peace dwells.
[time=2102] It is a peace which God gives to us when we come to him to receive it.
[time=2107] Now let us notice some things about this peace.
[time=2110] First of all the quality of perfect peace.
[time=2115] There is an imperfect peace which people know about today.
[time=2121] Some of you may have imperfect peace.
[time=2125] One kind of imperfect peace is the imperfect peace that comes out of ignorance.
[time=2129] Some folks just don't know how bad it is.
[time=2133] They're living in a world all by themselves feeling no pain.
[time=2136] They have sort of a peace that comes from being unplugged from everything.
[time=2141] I think folks that get tripped off on drugs and alcohol and all of that are looking for that kind of peace.
[time=2146] That's the only kind they get. They just unplug themselves from their environment and they call that peace.
[time=2150] But it's an imperfect peace.
[time=2152] Jeremiah, the prophet reminds us that in the day in the future there is going to be a time when men will say peace, peace when there is no peace.
[time=2161] And they will be living in a time of mental ignorance.
[time=2165] They will have programmed themselves to believe that everything is all right when in reality everything is all wrong.
[time=2170] There may be some of you listening to me today who think you have peace but it's the imperfect peace of ignorance.
[time=2176] You just haven't stopped to figure out what's going on yet. You don't know how bad it really is.
[time=2181] There's another kind of peace which we might call the peace of dependence.
[time=2185] There are some kinds of peace that are related to situations and people and individuals and circumstances.
[time=2193] For instance, some of you may have peace that is found in a person.
[time=2198] Some of you may have your peace wrapped up in a situation or in a circumstance perhaps in a job, in a position.
[time=2205] But woe to the person whose peace is wrapped up in such transient circumstances.
[time=2211] A pastor who finds his peace even in the person of his wife can soon be decimated if his wife is taken away from him in death.
[time=2220] A young man who finds his peace in the life of his beloved wife can be decimated if that wife is taken out of the world
[time=2227] and she is gone and the source of his peace is gone.
[time=2233] A woman who finds the source of her peace in the life of her beloved mother can discover that peace shattered if her mother is taken out of this life.
[time=2242] Jobs may come and go, circumstances may change.
[time=2246] We may be living on the threshold of the time when men and women who have found their peace and their economic stability and security
[time=2253] will find it shattered in front of them if our economists are telling us the truth.
[time=2259] A noted businessman with whom I met this week told me that there are some who are prophesying the demise of our standard of living in our generation in America.
[time=2267] There are men and women all over our culture who have found the source of peace and tranquility in their lives
[time=2274] which they have been able to buy and the prestige which they have been able to set up with that which they have brought together through their effort
[time=2281] however good or bad and their peace is in a circumstance.
[time=2285] Men and women that is dependent peace and that is imperfect peace.
[time=2289] God says he wants to give us the kind of peace that transcends people and individuals and circumstances and economic situations and all of that which we see around us.
[time=2301] His peace is perfect. The quality of his peace is the kind of peace that never fails.
[time=2309] Now notice secondly the quantity of his peace.
[time=2312] There is a very interesting thing in the text and if you have marginal renderings in your Bible you may have already noticed
[time=2318] that in the phrase perfect peace the marginal rendering says not perfect peace but peace peace.
[time=2326] In the Hebrew language sometimes when they are trying to be strength to a phrase they will double the word
[time=2332] and if we read this text as it is actually written it would read like this.
[time=2337] Thou will keep him in peace peace whose mind is stayed upon thee.
[time=2342] It is God's duplicated peace. It means that his supply is sufficient, that it meets our need, that it is peace sufficient for every situation.
[time=2352] As I was thinking of this I was reminded of the comparative passage in the 4th chapter of Philippians which tells us that
[time=2360] we are to be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication we are to make known our request to God.
[time=2367] And then the promise comes that the God of peace will garrison our hearts and our minds with peace.
[time=2376] And there it is the double peace, God's peace of heart, God's peace of mind, God will give us peace peace in the midst of the situation.
[time=2387] It is one thing to think peace, it's another thing to believe and to trust.
