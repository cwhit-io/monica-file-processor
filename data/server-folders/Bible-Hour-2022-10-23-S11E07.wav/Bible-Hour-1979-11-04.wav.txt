[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=24] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=78] >> Thank you, Angie, may be seated.
[time=84] We welcome you to the service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, not only all of you gathered here in the auditorium, but all of our friends who have joined us now by television.
[time=93] We're grateful to have the privilege of sharing this hour, and it is our prayer that it will be an hour of encouragement, instruction, and inspiration for all of us.
[time=102] Right now, we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir as they sing for us a great hymn of appreciation for our Lord, all glory to Jesus.
[time=112] [MUSIC]
[time=142] [ Singing ]
[time=242] >> Choir has caused us to look forward to the day when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=253] That will be a day I don't believe far removed from this day when Jesus Christ will be crowned as King, and people who have rejected Him will acknowledge that He is Lord.
[time=265] We're so grateful to God for the ministry of music.
[time=269] There's never a service that we have in this church, but what my heart is touched and blessed and spoken to by the musicians God has entrusted to this church.
[time=278] I had the opportunity in this past week to be sharing in the ministry of another church, even a church quite a bit larger than this one.
[time=286] I don't believe we can go anyplace in the country and find the kind of music God has blessed us with here.
[time=292] We're so grateful for everyone who has a part.
[time=294] One who has blessed our hearts many times, Mr. Ron Hackett is going to sing a prayer.
[time=299] I trust that you'll pray with him as he thanks God for what he means to us.
[time=305] And thank you, Lord, for the trials that come my way in that way I can go each day.
[time=336] As I let you in, and thank you, Lord, for the patience of trials being in that process of growing I can learn to care.
[time=364] But it calls the best way I am to let my human nature down and let the spirit take control of all I do.
[time=385] Cause when was trials come my human nature shouts the things to do and God's sovereignty can be easily ignored.
[time=406] And thank you, Lord, with each trial I feel it's mine that you're there to help lead and guide me away from home.
[time=426] Cause you promised, Lord, that what every test is that your way of escaping is easier to bear.
[time=447] But it calls the best way I am to let my human nature down and let the spirit take control of all I do.
[time=466] Cause when was trials come my human nature shouts all the things to do and God's sovereignty can be easily ignored.
[time=487] And thank you, Lord, for the victory that growing brings will surrender of every King.
[time=502] I just know with God, but thank you, Lord, that where everything's put in place out in front I can see your place.
[time=526] And that's where you will be, Lord.
[time=542] Thank you so much for joining us on the Bible Hour today and especially those of you who have joined us for the very first time we want to explain that during this particular time in our service my wife Don and I have an opportunity to talk with you personally
[time=556] about the matters of television that really pertain to you at home.
[time=560] Donna, we've had some very difficult times in the life of our church over the past few weeks.
[time=565] We don't usually have that much sorrow at one time because we're a young congregation.
[time=570] Well, Lord, it's really blessed us. We've had a lot of weddings, but very few funerals.
[time=576] But in these past few days there have been a number of our church members and families here who have gone through some pretty deep times.
[time=583] And one of the things that I've been grateful for has been the little answer book that we put together.
[time=589] On a number of occasions I've had the opportunity to share this little book of Scripture with those who have been going through some deep waters.
[time=596] I remember recently going over some Scriptures on the subject of comfort and grief and sorrow.
[time=602] And as I opened the book and shared these verses I could sense that they were really an encouragement to the people who were experiencing these problems.
[time=609] In the section, for instance, on grief and sorrow in the answer book, we have passages from Psalm 23 from Matthew 5 from Matthew 11 from John 14.
[time=620] And all of these passages are passages of encouragement for people who are experiencing these difficult things.
[time=627] The answer book is one of the finest little tools we've ever prepared.
[time=631] And it's available for our friends at home if they'll just write and ask for it and it's absolutely free.
[time=636] It's our way of extending the ministry of the Bible hour beyond the time limits that we have on Sunday and into their homes each week.
[time=644] If you would like to have your free copy of the answer book, just write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=657] We'd be happy to send a book to you this week if we can hear from you.
[time=661] Donna, while we're sending the answer book, we'd also like to let them in on a very special Bible reading program called The Daily Walk.
[time=668] The Daily Walk is a way to read through the Bible in a year.
[time=671] And in the month of November, we're in the second month of our program, but you can start in this program anytime you want to.
[time=678] We have hundreds of people all over this area who are reading through the Scriptures along with us.
[time=683] And I trust we'll be able to read the entire Bible by the time the year is ended.
[time=687] If you'd like to have your free copy of The Daily Walk, and you will write to us, we'll be ever so happy to send it to you.
[time=693] Once again, why don't you give that address?
[time=695] For your copy of the answer book or The Daily Walk, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=707] And today, we have a number of sponsors again for our program. Our sponsors are Harold Draper on Channel 46.
[time=717] Glenn Engel, Channel 21.
[time=720] L.O. McCray, Channel 21.
[time=723] Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Schindler, Channel 21, and also a Founders Club member.
[time=729] And Mr. and Mrs. Lamar Carey, Channel 21, and a Founders Club member also.
[time=734] None of the sponsors club people are those who support the television ministry for a substantial amount
[time=741] to make sure that the program goes out over the year on a particular Sunday.
[time=745] Associate sponsors give $100 to make sure that this particular program is aired and the cost is cared for for the airtime in this area.
[time=753] And of course in South Bend, Chicago, Indianapolis, and in the other areas where the program is seen.
[time=758] So we're grateful that we have some folks who are willing to stand behind us at that level and make sure the Bible Hour is being seen regularly every place where we have an opportunity to share it.
[time=770] The sponsor's program is not reserved for a select few, is it?
[time=775] No, anyone that would like to get involved is we'd be happy to have them.
[time=779] So we'd like to share these three things with you today and hope that you'll remember them and we'll take the opportunity to sit down and write to us this week so that we can help you get involved.
[time=790] We have some things we want to give you and we want to encourage you to be involved in helping us.
[time=795] Before I give you the address again, let me remind all of you who are watching here in Fort Wayne that if you haven't already returned your reservations for our special television banquet here that you ought to be doing that today.
[time=807] I've run into a few around town this week as we've talked together.
[time=810] They've said, "Oh yes, we're planning to come but we haven't sent our reservation in yet." I hope you'll do that so that we don't have a last minute problem of making sure we have enough room for everyone
[time=820] and we'd be glad to see you and we're looking forward to these banquets in these next days and hope we'll have a chance to greet you personally.
[time=826] Now before we go back to the morning service, if you'd like to have your free copy of the answer book or if we can send you the daily walk to help you read through the Bible, each day taking a very special portion to read it and ultimately reading the entire Bible in a year
[time=841] or if you'd like to be a part of the sponsors program, let me encourage you to write to this address.
[time=847] Post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815
[time=854] and honey the thought just crossed my mind that there might be some people watching today who are not familiar with the banquet
[time=860] and if they would give us a call here at the church that they're in Fort Wayne, we'd be happy to supply them with information.
[time=866] That's absolutely right and we're going to be there together hopefully to greet many of our Bible our friends and we'll be very sad if we miss you.
[time=874] We hope you'll be a part of it and if you don't have the information that you need just call the church's number and we'll be happy to give you the information and send it to you right away.
[time=882] Now it's time to get back to the service and I trust you'll stay with us for the entire hour as we share the Word of God together.
[time=892] I know we all stand as we sing.
[time=896] Lord!
[time=921] Lord we serve you.
[time=949] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=952] I've discovered as I've moved about the country that most pastors are happy
[time=959] if they can find a minister of music who can lead congregational music in the choir and then if he has any other abilities that's sort of a plus.
[time=967] God has blessed us not only with a great congregational leader and a great choir leader but a man who knows the keyboards of both the organ and the piano and sings to the glory of God and we're grateful for that.
[time=979] We don't take them for granted we thank God for them.
[time=981] Please listen to Don and Janet Kruger as they share with us in music now.
[time=1004] God's amazing grace sustains me every waking hour.
[time=1010] This amazing grace has given peace and joy and power.
[time=1018] God's amazing grace forgives and cleanses me within.
[time=1024] Grace supplied on Calvary now has freed my soul from sin.
[time=1032] God's amazing grace is every day the same.
[time=1042] Grace that keeps me daily in his macho's name.
[time=1052] God's amazing grace forgives and makes me whole.
[time=1061] Grace that satisfies my soul.
[time=1071] Grace that fills my heart with every joy that man can move.
[time=1087] Grace to give me victory in this world of care and all.
[time=1095] Grace that conquers Satan's power and cleanses me within.
[time=1103] Grace supplied on Calvary now has freed my soul from sin.
[time=1112] God's amazing grace is every day the same.
[time=1122] Grace that keeps me daily in his macho's name.
[time=1132] God's amazing grace forgives and makes me whole.
[time=1141] Grace that satisfies my soul.
[time=1168] Thank you, Krueger. That was good.
[time=1176] And we appreciate amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=1183] In the early service at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, our time structure is a bit limited on occasion.
[time=1190] We don't have quite as much time as we have in this later service.
[time=1193] On an occasion in the past, we have cut the program a little bit short in the early part and have eliminated the last number before the message.
[time=1202] One time we did that and it was Starr Narwald who was eliminated.
[time=1206] I learned that that's not a very good thing to do around here.
[time=1210] And I promised the early service people that I'd never do it again.
[time=1214] And since we missed Starr one time in the past, she's promised to sing twice as good today as she did that.
[time=1221] Good.
[time=1240] Well, now my own belief I take the finite risk of trusting as a child.
[time=1260] I believe that now my own belief I walk in to be alone,
[time=1276] trusting all the ones I love so much to feel the world that others seem to know.
[time=1298] Should I never feel a thing? I claim him even so.
[time=1312] I believe that now my own belief I take the finite risk of trusting as a child.
[time=1335] I love so much to feel the world that others seem to know.
[time=1348] Should I never feel a thing? I claim him even so.
[time=1362] And I believe that now my own belief I walk in to the unknown, trusting all the ones.
[time=1385] I take the finite risk of trusting as a child.
[time=1405] Thank you Starr. We've had good music this morning,
[time=1416] and we thank God for the preparation that it brings to our hearts not only in the ministry that we hear, but as it opens our hearts to be sensitive to the Word of God as it is taught.
[time=1426] I'm asking you to join me today in the 25th chapter of the book of Matthew.
[time=1431] Matthew's Gospel, chapter 25. So if you would open your Bibles to that portion of the Word of God,
[time=1437] while you're finding your place there, let me say to you that today we begin our annual stewardship month in the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1445] Every once in a while someone says to me, do you mean you take a whole month to teach the doctrine of stewardship in your church?
[time=1452] And I always smile when that question is asked because you see I've learned something in the last few years,
[time=1458] and that is that the doctrine of stewardship is one of the most prominent doctrines in the Word of God.
[time=1464] It does not rest upon just a few isolated passages here and there, but the fact of the matter is it is the most prominent doctrine in all of the Scripture.
[time=1473] You can scarcely turn to any one book in the Bible and not find in it principles that deal with stewardship,
[time=1479] not just the stewardship of our money, but the stewardship of our talents and our lives.
[time=1484] The Lord Jesus gave many parables in His teaching ministry. 13 of them had to do with the doctrine of stewardship.
[time=1491] So when someone asked me if we spend a whole month on this, I say yes, but if we gave to stewardship the time that would represent its prominence in the Bible,
[time=1501] we would have to take three months to do it because it would take approximately three out of the 12 months
[time=1507] to represent the importance of stewardship as it's found in the Bible.
[time=1512] Now I hope none of you will get any fears that we're going to do that.
[time=1515] We're not going to have three months of stewardship at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1519] I had a friend who was the pastor of a church in Detroit, and someone asked him, "Did he ever preach on stewardship?" And he said, "Yes." And they said, "How often?" He said, "Once." And they were sort of surprised. He said, "But it lasts all year long." And there are a lot of churches where that's true, and I want you to know that we believe it ought to be taught,
[time=1537] apologetically, what it is that God expects from us in this whole matter of the stewardship of life, ministry, and money.
[time=1545] Matthew chapter 25, beginning at verse 14, "For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling into a far country
[time=1552] who called his servants and delivered unto them his goods.
[time=1556] And unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one and to every man according to his ability,
[time=1562] and straightway took his journey.
[time=1564] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made other five talents, and likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
[time=1572] But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his Lord's money.
[time=1576] After a long time, the Lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them.
[time=1580] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, "Lord, thou deliverst unto me five talents; behold, I have gained beside them five talents more." His Lord said unto him, "Well done, thou good in faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." He also that had received two talents came and said, "Lord, thou deliverst unto me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents beside them." His Lord said unto him, "Well done, good in faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Then he that had received the one talent came and said, "Lord, I knew thee, that thou art in hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown in gathering where thou hast not spread, and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth, lo, there hast what is thine."
[time=1632] His Lord answered and said unto him, "Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not,
[time=1638] and gather where I have not spread, thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
[time=1644] and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.
[time=1648] Take therefore the talent from him, and give unto him who hath ten talents, unto every one that hath shall be given,
[time=1656] and he shall have abundance, but from him that hath not shall be taken away, even that which he hath,
[time=1662] and cast the unprofitable servant into utter darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=1667] Father, we pray that you will help us to understand thy word today, as it applies and relates to each of our lives,
[time=1674] but we pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen." In these next days, we're going to be speaking on the subject, the parables of stewardship.
[time=1684] The first one is the most all-encompassing parable in the Word of God, for in it are the truths of stewardship,
[time=1690] as it touches every area of our life.
[time=1693] This parable has come to be known as the parable of the talents.
[time=1697] Now the word "talent" is a word which represents a certain amount of money in the economy of the day of our Lord,
[time=1704] but so wide sweeping has this parable been known that the word "talent" has been transposed into our society,
[time=1712] and now it represents all that a man has, both his ability, his responsibility, and his money.
[time=1719] The word "talent" in this passage is first and primarily a word which represents financial involvement,
[time=1726] and so what we have here is the story of what some folks did with that which God entrusted to their care.
[time=1733] Now it's interesting to me that the parable of the talents follows hard upon the parable of the virgins.
[time=1739] In the same chapter, we are taught through the parable of the virgins the importance of waiting for the Lord's return.
[time=1746] If you have read that passage, you know that the virgins, according to this passage of Scripture, were waiting for the return of the Lord, and some were ready and some were not, and the parable teaches that it's important to be ready when the Lord returns.
[time=1761] It is interesting to me that the parable of the talents follows the parable of the virgins in order that we might keep two very important truths in balance.
[time=1770] One is that it's important to be waiting for the Lord, but the other is that it's important to be working for the Lord.
[time=1776] We have an awful lot of folks who can wait for the Lord.
[time=1779] They are prophecy nuts and they know all of the details of prophecy.
[time=1783] They're waiting for the Lord. The problem is no one can get them involved in working for the Lord.
[time=1788] And God sees this in a wonderful balance in the parable of the virgins.
[time=1793] He teaches us to be ready waiting for God and the Lord to come back.
[time=1797] In the parable of the talents He teaches us the importance of occupying till He comes.
[time=1802] Now, this parable is crucial for our day.
[time=1806] For it is obvious to all of us who are in places of responsibility in the ministry of the Lord Jesus that the one problem we have in our circles is not that we don't have enough individuals to get the task done, but that we do not have enough of the individuals who have signed up who are committed to that which they have signed up to do.
[time=1825] In our churches, like ours and other churches of our size, we have a tremendous personnel problem.
[time=1831] It is always our task to be finding men and women to be involved in the ministries which must be carried forth if the church is to thrive in the gospel.
[time=1840] It is always our task in leadership to try to find those who are a part of the ministry of the church,
[time=1846] many times committed members of the church, and get them involved under the load so that the work is carried on many shoulders instead of on a few.
[time=1855] The problem that is represented in the parable of the talents is a significant one.
[time=1860] It means in its teaching that we need to understand what it is that God is given to us to do and we're to do it.
[time=1867] Now I want you to notice several things about this parable.
[time=1870] First of all, I want you to know the reason for the stewardship.
[time=1873] It is found in verse 14, and in the 14th verse we read that the stewardship was necessary because a man was traveling into a far country and he needed someone to represent him in his absence.
[time=1886] And so the scripture says he called his servants together.
[time=1889] He lined them up perhaps in the conference room and he said to them, "I am going to be gone for a period of time.
[time=1895] I am giving you all of my goods and I'm asking you to represent me now in that which is in my interest in the future." Here is all that belongs to me in this area.
[time=1906] You have some of it, you have some, you have some.
[time=1908] While I'm gone, you take care of the affairs of state as it relates to me.
[time=1913] It is obvious that this is a picture of the fact that when the Lord Jesus went back to heaven,
[time=1919] having come from the Father to provide salvation for us on the cross, he gathered his apostles together as representatives of all of us and he committed to the apostles the ministry of the gospel.
[time=1931] And he said to them, "I am giving you to do that which represents my kingdom in this age."
[time=1938] It is a startling and sobering fact to me when I read this parable that all that pertains to God in practice and in ministry in this world today is carried on by his servants.
[time=1951] God is not personally physically involved in his world today as an entity.
[time=1958] Somebody says to me, "Where is Jesus Christ? He is in heaven.
[time=1962] Where is God the Father? He is in heaven. Where is the Holy Spirit?
[time=1965] Where is he, class? He lives within the lives of every believer and therefore the only work that God can get done in his world today, he has to get done through spirit-inpowered believers.
[time=1977] That is why when Jesus went back to heaven, he gave the great commission.
[time=1981] He said, "All power is given unto me. Go ye therefore into all the world and preach the gospel."
[time=1987] We have been commissioned as the servants of the Lord to carry on the master's business in his absence.
[time=1993] And now he is back in heaven and we are here.
[time=1996] In men and women it is an awesome thing to remember that we represent the Lord and we are responsible for the affairs of the Lord Jesus Christ in this world today.
[time=2005] Notice that at the end of the fifteenth verse he says, that after he had dispensed all of these gifts and responsibilities to the stewards,
[time=2015] that straight way he took his journey.
[time=2017] After the Lord had given the great commission and challenged the people of the church to do his work, he went back to heaven and he leaves us here to carry on the responsibilities of the Lord's work.
[time=2028] Let me say it again, God cannot do anything in this world apart from a human body
[time=2034] which is dedicated to the cause of Christ.
[time=2037] It is not that he cannot, because he is unable, it is that he will not, because he is chosen and deigned to work through his children.
[time=2044] He has no hands but our hands. He has no feet but our feet.
[time=2048] He has no lips but our lips, no eyes but our eyes, no ears but our ears.
[time=2053] God is using men and women today in stewardship to carry on his work.
[time=2058] He is in heaven, we are here, we're responsible for the ministry of the gospel.
[time=2064] That is the reason for the stewardship.
[time=2066] Men and women, the reason why I must be careful with what I do with my money and my abilities is because that doesn't belong to me, that belongs to my Father.
[time=2075] And he has given me the responsibility of discharging that in this world in his absence until he comes back again for his own.
[time=2085] The reason for the stewardship.
[time=2087] Notice secondly the rationale for the stewardship.
[time=2090] It says in verse 15 that he gave one five talents, he gave another two and he gave another one.
[time=2095] Now that just blows the minds of all of those who believe that every person is created with equal ability to serve.
[time=2101] All men are equal in worth in the eyes of God.
[time=2105] Every person that's ever been born into this world is of the same value and worth to the Lord.
[time=2111] But not every person has been endowed with the same ability to serve.
[time=2117] And we are foolish when we think that because we are Christians we are all equally endowed in the same areas to serve God.
[time=2125] If you've ever been in a church where they believe that you know how awful that can be.
[time=2129] When someone who has not been endowed with a ministry of music considers the fact that they have been equally endowed with someone who has the ministry of music.
[time=2138] And all of the body suffers through that experience.
[time=2142] Or you have been in a church where someone who has the idea that they have been endowed as a teacher
[time=2148] is equally as someone else who has been endowed as a teacher.
[time=2151] But it is obvious that they do not have that gift and the whole class suffers.
[time=2155] The Bible says that God has dispensed to each man severly according to his abilities.
[time=2159] Now I want you to notice how this stewardship was distributed.
[time=2163] First of all it was distributed according to the judgment of God.
[time=2167] This is very important for us to understand.
[time=2170] There is an awful tendency in our circles today to be involved in the ministry of comparison.
[time=2175] Why do they have more than I do?
[time=2177] Why is that church bigger than ours?
[time=2179] Why do they have more ability than I have?
[time=2182] Why can she sing better than I can? Why can he minister better than I can?
[time=2186] I want you to notice something in this text that the Lord distributed the gifts.
[time=2192] And someone says to me why did he do it?
[time=2194] First of all he did it according to his own purpose.
[time=2197] In 1 Corinthians 1211 a passage that deals with the gifts of the Spirit.
[time=2201] The Bible says but all these work at that one and the self-same spirit giving to every man severly as he chooses.
[time=2211] Here is the sovereignty of God in action.
[time=2214] God's sovereignly determining that he is going to endow someone with five talents and another one with one talent and another with two or three.
[time=2222] It is the sovereign purpose of God.
[time=2225] Now if we could understand that men and women it would take an awful lot of the tension out of our lives.
[time=2231] If I'm a two-talent man and not a five-talent man that's not my problem.
