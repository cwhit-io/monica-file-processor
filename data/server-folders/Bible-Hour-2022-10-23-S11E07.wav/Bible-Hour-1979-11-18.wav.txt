[time=1441] And crown him, Lord of all.
[time=1454] We'll join the earth as he's gone.
[time=1465] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1470] Now let me ask you to join me in the Word of God as we turn together to the Gospel of Luke and the 17th chapter.
[time=1478] Luke chapter 17.
[time=1480] And I'm reading today from the Word of God in the 17th chapter of Luke's Gospel beginning at the 11th verse.
[time=1488] Luke chapter 17 and verse 11.
[time=1500] And it came to pass as Jesus went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
[time=1507] And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off.
[time=1513] And they lifted up their voices and said, "Jesus, master, have mercy on us."
[time=1520] And when he saw them, he said unto them, "Go show yourselves unto the priests." And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed.
[time=1528] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice he glorified God.
[time=1536] And he fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks, and he was a Samaritan.
[time=1542] And Jesus answering said, "We're not ten cleansed, and where are the nine?"
[time=1549] There are not found that return to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.
[time=1562] Our Father in heaven, we pray that you will take this which we have read.
[time=1567] Cause us to see it first of all in its setting so that we will understand what it says.
[time=1573] And then our Father we pray that you will help us to apply it to our own hearts, that we may understand what it means and what it means to us.
[time=1581] We thank thee our Father for the privilege we have of the Word of God.
[time=1586] And it is not always that it comforts us, that causes us to give thanks.
[time=1591] Sometimes it is because it corrects us and helps us to know the way we should walk.
[time=1596] Because of that we are different people and we look back to see the changes in our lives and pause to give thanks for the important message from God which is the Bible.
[time=1606] We pray that you will open our hearts to the instruction of thy Word today in preparation of our hearts for this particular season of the year.
[time=1615] We might be drawn to a spirit of thankfulness which would glorify thy name.
[time=1620] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=1626] Someone has said that if you want to find gratitude these days you have to look for it in the dictionary because that's the only place you will ever find it.
[time=1635] I'm not certain that that's true but I couldn't help but think about that when I read just recently the story of a rebellious young couple that were walking down the street in the city one day.
[time=1648] One of them turned to the other and said I'm going over and pick up my unemployment check.
[time=1654] Then I'll drop by the university to see what's holding up my check for my federal education grant.
[time=1660] After that I'll pick up our food stamps meanwhile you go over to the free clinic and check your tests and pick up my free new glasses at the health center.
[time=1668] Then go to the welfare department and apply for an increase in our eligibility limit.
[time=1673] Then I'll meet you at five o'clock at the federal building for a mass demonstration against this rotten establishment.
[time=1679] When I read that I was reminded that though that is certainly reflected in the hearts of many people in our country today it's also reflected in the lives of many Christians not necessarily about the establishment but about many things that they have which they so easily take for granted.
[time=1696] The story which we have read from the book of Luke is a story about gratitude and ingratitude.
[time=1703] It happens in the life of our Lord as he is on his way to the cross.
[time=1708] He is about to be sacrificed but on his way according to this record he stops in an unnamed place and there he meets the need of ten individuals.
[time=1719] Verses 11 and 12 give to us some indication of the need that was present in the life of these ten lepers.
[time=1727] It was an unknown village but the disease was a known disease.
[time=1732] The disease of leprosy the scripture tells us that in that group of ten there were nine Jews and one Samaritan.
[time=1740] Kind of a strange combination wouldn't you say? Nine Jews and a Samaritan since the Samaritans had no dealings with the Jews and the Jews despised the Samaritans yet here these ten were in a group.
[time=1753] Someone has reminded us that adversity makes strange bedfellows of us all and leprosy has a tendency to break down racial and all other kinds of prejudice and binds people together.
[time=1769] There is a kind of disease which all of us have which causes us to be bound together in humanity. Men and women that disease is sin.
[time=1778] And though we may be prejudiced against others in our sinfulness there is a kind of disease which we all have that just lops us all together in one big group.
[time=1789] The Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and there is no definition there of the kind of people we must be to qualify for that category.
[time=1799] Just as these lepers who before the disease was noticed in their body would have been enemies and now they are bound together with their disease the adversity of sin binds us all together.
[time=1810] That's what someone meant when they said that the ground is level at the foot of the cross because we are all together in the same group.
[time=1818] These lepers were together in their need crying out to God. The scripture says that they stood a far off.
[time=1826] Now that's understandable when you know something about the nature of the disease of leprosy.
[time=1832] In the Jewish community when a person was diagnosed to be leprosy they were ostracized and put out of the camp put out of the community and they were not allowed to come near.
[time=1844] In fact they were to go about all of their business and when anyone would come near them who was not a leper they were to cry out with a loud voice unclean, unclean lest anyone should come near to them and be defiled with their sickness.
[time=1858] We do not know very much about leprosy in our culture today but some basic understanding of it is necessary if we are to comprehend the true nature of this story.
[time=1869] According to statistics there are approximately 3 million lepers in the world today. Most of them would be found in Africa and in South America.
[time=1879] Leprosy is a disease which first of all lodges within the body unknown to the one who possesses it and then it begins to show itself in small nodules that develop on the body especially on the extremities.
[time=1893] According to those who have studied and who have cared for leprosy they tell us that after the nodules develop on the extremities especially the face, sometimes the legs and arms.
[time=1906] The skin then begins to be furrowed and in a very ugly way disfiguration takes place. The ear lobes, the lips, the nose is thickened.
[time=1917] Someone has said that a person who is in the beginning stages of leprosy develops the features of a lion. Their face takes on the perspective of a lion.
[time=1926] It's a very ugly disfiguring disease. After the beginning stages of the enlargement of the nose and the ears and the lips and all of the ulcerations within then gradually the body itself the skin begins to ulcerate and it's a very putrid kind of disease to observe even on film.
[time=1946] Digits begin to drop off of the body that are eaten up with the disease. Eyes usually are destroyed and ultimately if it goes untreated leprosy is a fatal disease.
[time=1959] It is not an accident that leprosy has often been used as an illustration of sin in the life of a person. Sin has a drastic effect. The Bible says that sin is fatal. Sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.
[time=1976] But sin like leprosy begins unnoticed within the life. Sometimes we're not even aware that it's there. Gradually it begins to spread throughout the system. First it begins to show itself here and then there and little by little it begins to eat away at the life until ultimately if undetected and undiagnosed and unministered to sin will have its effect in the life in the same measure that leprosy does.
[time=2003] In all of its ugliness it will destroy a person. These nine individuals had the dread disease of leprosy. There's was a great need. May I say to you today that though you may not have the outward disfiguration of body that I have described and describing the disease of leprosy if you have not brought your sin to the great physician and have been spiritually healed.
[time=2029] The ugliness of your person cannot be any greater in its description than the ugliness I have described in terms of leprosy. It may not be as noticeable to you now but if it goes unchecked it will eat away at your person until it will destroy you even as the Bible says it will do.
[time=2048] The great need in the life of these lepers was evident to them and I think in some measure they may have an advantage over us for they could hold out their hands and look at their body and in doing so they could see that they were ill, that they were sick.
[time=2063] So many modern Americans have the same sickness within them but they have not been sensitized to it and they consider themselves to be whole when in fact they are carrying the seeds of death in their body.
[time=2078] Now in this sickness as the Lord passed by we read in verse 13 that the lepers lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us.
[time=2090] I want you to notice their cry they lifted up their voices being a far off they could not get near to the Lord and so they had to reach his attention with the loudness of their cry and in their crying out to the Lord they addressed him in a very significant manner.
[time=2107] They called him Jesus and they called him master in addressing him as Jesus they acknowledged that he was the Savior that he was the one in whom their hopes were to be met.
[time=2120] They expressed their faith in Christ and recognized his authority in addressing him as master they acknowledged that not only was he the one to whom they would come for salvation but he was the superintendent and authoritative one
[time=2135] and in believing in him there was hope for the cure of their condition.
[time=2141] These ten lepers must have had some knowledge of the Lord Jesus before they addressed him in that way.
[time=2147] It's a very unusual way for unlearned people to address the Savior.
[time=2151] They perhaps had heard of his miraculous doings in other places and in faith they cried out Jesus master.
[time=2160] But then they asked for mercy Jesus master have mercy upon us they were conscious of their condition.
[time=2170] They understood that they did not need justice they needed mercy.
[time=2174] They did not need what was coming to them they needed something better than that and so they cried out.
[time=2180] Oh God have mercy on us it is not unsimilar to the prayer of the sinner who recognizing within him that he is a sinner says God be merciful to me a sinner and save me for Jesus sake.
[time=2195] So we see in these men a tremendous need and we recognize their cry for help but I want you to notice in the 14th verse the quick response of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2206] We read in verse 14 that when he saw them he said unto them he saw them and he said unto them he observed them and then he directed them.
[time=2217] He saw them in their condition someone has written that whenever suffering humanity was passed by compassionate deity tremendous changes took place.
[time=2232] Lord Jesus wherever he was looked upon suffering humanity and reached out to deal with that suffering as he was able to do as the son of God.
[time=2241] He saw them in their condition he saw them in the ulcerations of the body in all of the terrible aspects of the disease he saw them for what they were and he loved them.
[time=2253] And I love that because it says to us who are spiritually ill what this text says to those who are physically ill that Jesus Christ the almighty God sees us as we are he sees us in our sin and in our lack of acceptance of Christ.
[time=2277] He sees us and he longs to direct us even as he directed these lepers he observed them and then he directed them his directions to these lepers are strange.
[time=2288] He didn't say come to me and I will heal you he said go away from me.
[time=2292] He didn't say as he did to the blind bring him hither and I will heal him he didn't call the sick to himself but he sent them on their way and gave them some very specific instructions.
[time=2304] Many have been confused by his instruction he said go and show yourself to the priests.
[time=2312] Strange words to those who were not even allowed to be a part of the community.
[time=2318] All but Jesus had a purpose in that for he came to fulfill the law every part of it and the Jewish law said that when a person who had been infected with the disease of leprosy would be healed or the disease would be arrested.
[time=2333] As sometimes it was in the body of the leper that in order for them to be reinstated into the community they would have to show themselves to the priest and be declared ceremonially clean.
[time=2346] And so Jesus was honoring the Old Testament law when he said to the lepers go and show yourself to the priest.
[time=2353] He did it not only to observe the law but he did it in order that there might be verification for the miracle that was wrought.
[time=2361] For the priest had seen many who had been arrested in the disease of leprosy but I dare say they had seen very few who had had the disease totally obliterated from their bodies.
[time=2372] And so Jesus wanted those priests to observe that these who had been sick were now completely whole in every way.
[time=2380] And the scripture says he instructed them to go on their way and he tested the faith that they had expressed when they cried out to him.
[time=2389] Now the immediate outcome of his instruction is an interesting story in itself.
[time=2394] The scripture says that while they were on their way to the priest they were cleansed.
[time=2399] They were not cleansed when they started they were not cleansed when they got to the priest but as they walked along the road and obedience to the Lord the cleansing took place.
[time=2409] Now if you have any kind of an imagination and all of us do you must certainly have imagined as I have on many occasions what it must have been like for those lepers to be walking down the road.
[time=2418] And all of a sudden one of them begins to observe as he's gesturing with his hands that where he had only had two fingers left and the disease had eaten his fingers up now his hand was whole.
[time=2430] And he began to gesture and to talk and didn't notice it at first and then all of a sudden he held it out and he realized something was different about it.
[time=2438] And so he began to examine himself and look and he saw that he was completely cleansed from the disease and he said to his brothers who walked along with him look at me.
[time=2450] I'm clean I'm cleansed and they began to look at themselves and I can't help but think that must have been one of the greatest times of exuberation and excitement that ever took place on that highway as they jumped and hugged each other and were so excited about their cleansing.
[time=2467] I don't see anything like that that even is close except in football games.
[time=2475] Have you ever seen how people mob each other in a football game?
[time=2479] I've often thought that you might be able to survive the whole season in that rough and tumble game and get killed in the excitement of a victory celebration.
[time=2487] In some of the games that were just on this last weekend where last minute victories were pulled out they literally mob each other and they dance around in such excitement that must have been what it was like that day when those lepers found that they were cured.
[time=2501] They were so on their way in obedience they were healed.
[time=2506] They believed to far off they did what the Lord told them to do and God healed them in the process of obedience.
[time=2514] And they saw the glow of health return to their bodies and anticipated their reinstatement in the temple and in the Jewish community.
[time=2523] Now verses 15 and 16 give us the postscript which is really the most important part of the story as it relates to us today.
[time=2531] For in verse 15 we realize that one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God.
[time=2542] Now this one is an illustration to us of the importance of gratitude in our lives.
[time=2548] I want you to notice that his expression of thanksgiving was based upon his experience of healing.
[time=2555] When he saw what had happened to him he could not bring himself to go on the rest of the way to the temple and fulfill the Lord's instruction without turning around and going back to the source of what had happened in his life
[time=2569] and giving praise and gratitude to the one who had healed him.
[time=2573] He recognized that this was not an accident he realized that the instruction of Jesus master had been the reality of what had happened in his own life.
[time=2582] And so the scripture says he turned back and went back to say thank you for what the Lord had done.
[time=2589] I couldn't help but observe as I was reading this passage of scripture and look in your Bibles with me and you'll see it too.
[time=2595] In verse 13 we read that when they were realizing their need they lifted up their voices.
[time=2601] That means they cried aloud Jesus master.
[time=2605] And then in verse 15 we read that when this one saw that he was healed he with a loud voice glorified God.
[time=2613] And I ask you this morning if you do not think when you read those two phrases together what crosses my mind as I consider that
[time=2622] in that how often the voices that we use to cry out for our needs being met in the person of the Lord are much louder voices than the voices we use when we praise and thank him for what he's done.
[time=2635] Most of us are pretty well equipped to ask God for what we need and we can do that with loudness and intensity.
[time=2641] But here was a man who used the same kind of intensity to praise the Lord that he used when he cried out for his need being met.
[time=2649] And in that he gives to us an illustration of what true thanksgiving ought to be.
[time=2654] He was definite and intense and excited about what God had done for him in his life.
[time=2662] The scripture says that he fell down at the feet of the Lord Jesus and he began to pray and he glorified God.
[time=2671] Now the amazing thing about the story was remember there were nine Jews and one Samaritan.
[time=2678] What does the scripture say? Who was the one who returned?
[time=2682] In fact it's almost as if it's an amazing story to read it.
[time=2687] For the scripture says in verse 16 that he fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and then like it was in a parenthesis and almost with amazement as you read it and he was the Samaritan.
[time=2700] You see the Samaritans were the outcast of the society.
[time=2707] They had set up a rival worship to their God.
[time=2711] And the Samaritans and the Jews were enemies.
[time=2714] The Jews had every reason to be thankful.
[time=2717] Here was Jesus Christ.
[time=2719] The answer to all of the Messianic prophecies which they knew so well.
[time=2724] They should have understood that in this Jesus master they were seeing face to face the Jewish Messiah and as Jews they should have come back glorifying God for the evidence of power that they had seen.
[time=2738] The Samaritan untaught perhaps, unknowledgeable about the heritage which was being evidenced in front of him and yet the one who had the least for which to be thankful was the one who came back to give thanks.
[time=2754] I believe that the ratio is just about the same today one out of ten and usually the one who really doesn't have as much to be thankful for.
[time=2763] Have you ever noticed that it's usually the person who has just a few things but really appreciates them that has the grateful thankful spirit and sometimes the people who have multiplied assets have come to understand that perhaps those things are theirs because they've deserved them or earned them?
[time=2781] He came back to say thanks.
[time=2784] I want you to notice the sad disappointment in the life of our Lord when he observed this situation.
[time=2791] Jesus answering said in him verse 17 were there not ten who were cleansed?
[time=2796] Where are the nine?
[time=2800] Many women do you know that when the Lord hears our prayer of thanksgiving he notices us and he is grateful?
[time=2809] Do you know that when he doesn't hear our prayer of thanksgiving he notices us and he's grieved?
[time=2816] I couldn't help but notice in this passage of Scripture that the Lord was as mindful of the ungrateful nine as he was of the grateful one.
[time=2825] Have you ever stopped to think that when you refuse to give back to God the praise and honor and thanksgiving that is due him you get the Lord's attention?
[time=2833] And the attention that you get is the attention of a grieved heart because he does not receive that which is due to him.
[time=2841] The nine ungrateful ones were as much in the mind of the Lord as were the one who came back but in a totally different sense.
[time=2851] He was grieved because these nine did not come to glorify him.
[time=2857] By the way could I just insert this as a parenthesis?
[time=2861] It seems in this passage at least that thanksgiving even had a priority over absolute obedience.
[time=2870] For in a measure the one who turned and came back to Jesus was not totally obedient because he had not yet shown himself unto the priest.
[time=2880] But the Lord Jesus so honors a thankful spirit that he elevates thanksgiving even above total obedience and you really can't separate it because his thanksgiving was a part of the total obedient heart which was within him.
[time=2896] I believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ that God Almighty places a very high priority on a grateful thankful spirit.
[time=2906] I wish a lot of God's people would be like the old lady who said she was doing lots better these days since she moved.
[time=2913] Someone said to her I didn't know you moved she said oh yes not physically but in my spirit I moved out of grumble alley and I'm living on thankful street now.
[time=2922] A lot of God's people live in grumble alley and they don't honor God that way.
[time=2927] They go around griping and complaining about everything they can't ever be pleased and supposedly they're Christians.
[time=2934] God honors a grateful spirit.
[time=2937] I wish I had time to show you all the things that happened to this man because he was grateful but let me just point out a couple of them.
[time=2944] First of all I want you to notice that he was elevated to a higher position just symbolically in the text but I believe it's indicative of a great and wonderful thing that happened in his life.
[time=2955] When he came back to give thanks the Lord looked at him and he said arise I know he met physically in his posture to get up but I also know that when a person evidences a heart of gratitude they immediately are elevated to a higher plane of life.
[time=2973] They are risen to a new standard of living because the grateful spirit puts them on a different level than everyone around them.
[time=2982] He was elevated in his position but he was accorded a larger blessing too.
[time=2987] The nine who listened to the Lord and followed the instruction and went to show themselves to the priest had physical healing but noticed the one who returned to the Lord Jesus to give thanks was accorded not only physical healing but spiritual healing as well.
[time=3004] For verse 19 the Lord said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and the word means a wholeness which encompasses all of the being.
[time=3017] This man got spiritual healing as well as physical healing and I'm reminded that whenever we come back to the throne of grace to give thanks for what God has already given us at that same throne of grace are many other gifts he longs to pour out upon us.
[time=3033] How much do we miss men and women because we refuse to gratefully acknowledge what God has already done?
[time=3041] Isn't that true in our own lives when your children come back to you to say thank you?
[time=3046] When they express their love to you in some tangible way doesn't that make you want to do even more?
[time=3053] And when they don't acknowledge it when they're ungrateful don't you find yourself struggling within yourself to be gracious?
[time=3061] It is not an accident that God has called our father and that we in our own parental patterns follow after that image.
[time=3069] I believe with all of my heart that when God's children come back to offer thanks to him for his gifts he longs and continues to try in every way to pour out additional gifts upon us.
[time=3080] We have not many times because we thank not. Here was a thankful man and God blessed him for it.
[time=3091] As I review this story I'm reminded of several truths which come down to us in this time where we are first of all I'm reminded that sin is still present with us and the disease of sin is ever rampant among us.
[time=3104] I'm reminded secondly that Jesus Christ is still passing by ready to hear those who cry out.
[time=3110] He's passing through this auditorium today down this aisle and that one and he's waiting for someone who recognizes his need to say Jesus master have mercy on me.
[time=3119] He's still present with us.
[time=3122] I'm reminded thirdly that grace is still doing a wonderful work in the hearts of people as these were healed so Jesus Christ today longs to heal those from their sin sickness if they'll cry out for it.
[time=3135] I'm also reminded men and women that in gratitude is very much present with us today. We like the nine who turned away have a tendency to focus our attention upon the gifts instead of on the giver.
[time=3148] We acknowledge our health only when it is taken from us. We acknowledge our safety only when accidents come upon us and we are so prone not to be conscious of what Jesus Christ has done even in his material goodness to each of us.
[time=3168] I wondered if the nine who turned away from the Lord had names. I don't even really know the name of the one who came back to say thanks.
[time=3178] But if you'll pardon my imagination and conclusion let me tell you that I've given the other nine some names and probably some of you will find yourself represented by one of these nine who forgot to say thank you.
[time=3192] The first one probably was called callousness. He just underestimated the blessing he had and he'd become hardened to every good thing. He just really wasn't even impressed by what happened.
[time=3206] The second was probably called pride. He examined what happened in his body and he said why I deserve to be healed. I'm not going back and thank anybody. I just got what I deserved. He was proud.
[time=3218] The third one was called selfishness and he said well I'm going to give this thing a two year test and if it really works and I can be sure that I've got everything I wanted then I'll go back and say thank you to the Lord.
[time=3231] The fourth of the nine was thoughtlessness. He was an embodiment of the truth that to thank is to think and you can't be thankful if you're not thankful.
[time=3242] He just didn't even think about what happened to him. He looked. He saw he went on his way really didn't let him impact his life at all. The sixth was a man called calculation.
[time=3256] He thought about going back to say thank you but he was afraid that if he did the Lord who had healed him might ask him to do something and so he calculated in his own mind that it might be a bit risky to come back to the feet of the Savior to say thank you and so he just went on his way.
[time=3270] He got what he needed. Why take another chance?
[time=3275] The seventh was called weakness. He didn't have the courage to go back. He was hoping that all the rest would return to say thank you but when he saw only one turn around he said I'm not going to go with the minority I'm going to stay with the majority.
[time=3290] The eighth was procrastination. He really meant to say thank you when he got around to it. He was going to do it someday and maybe after he saw the priest and went back and showed himself to the family and got everything kind of settled down in his life back into it.
[time=3304] But he never again had the opportunity for Jesus went down that road to the cross and died and soon was resurrected and went back to heaven. He missed his opportunity to say thank you and he lost it forever.
[time=3317] Or the ninth was called worldliness. It wasn't that he wasn't really thankful but his life just got so involved with all of the things that he was doing and all the things he wanted to do that really it was just sort of inconvenient to turn around and interrupt his schedule and go back and thank the Lord who had healed him.
[time=3337] I personally believe men and women that it is a sin to be ungrateful to God. Wherever you are which of the nine represents you I don't know but I want to tell you God honors a thankful heart.
[time=3353] And he waits for those of us who have been cleansed from our sin and made whole and clean to come back to the foot of the throne of grace with a grateful heart.
[time=3364] We do that with our lips. We do that with our lives. When we give our testimony, when we give our treasure, we say thank you to the Lord.
[time=3375] Are you a thankful? Thankful heart? Let us pray.
[time=3388] Our father we're grateful that God has a good ear for the music of his children and that when his own come back to appreciate him he hears us.
[time=3400] How the heart of God must be grieved as we go on our way week in and week out without ever pausing to give gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord.
[time=3412] Our father we pray that you will help us in this hour to understand that thanksgiving.
