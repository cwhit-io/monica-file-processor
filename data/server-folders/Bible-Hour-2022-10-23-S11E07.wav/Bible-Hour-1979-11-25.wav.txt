[time=277] >> Thank you, choir, for your ministry.
[time=282] We're so grateful for the ministry of music here.
[time=285] And we're just in the greatest season of the year for enjoyment of music at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=291] Just a few days we will be celebrating the Lord's birth with the great Christmas tree pageant that takes place here in this auditorium.
[time=300] This year seven times this presentation will be given.
[time=304] And I've already shared with our people in the early hour, and I share with those of you here in this auditorium during this hour, that if you haven't gotten your tickets and made reservation for one of the concerts, you better make sure to do it today because already most of the concerts are filled.
[time=320] We don't want you to be disappointed.
[time=322] There will be tickets available here in this building after this hour.
[time=325] For those of our friends at home, if you haven't written to get tickets for the concert, you wish to attend. I hope you will do it immediately or it will probably be too late.
[time=334] We enjoy the privilege of presenting the Christmas story in such a unique and fascinating way, and we sense that all of the folks in this area likewise appreciate it.
[time=343] Now we listen carefully to the ministry of Mr. Ron Hackett as he sings for us at this time.
[time=348] [MUSIC - 244 seconds]

[time=1472] - Thank you, Marilyn. I sure do love to hear her sing. Amen.
[time=1477] I want you to do something with me before we get into the word this morning.
[time=1484] A special network of communication was set up all over the country today so that almost all of the churches were called or some communications sent to them.
[time=1493] Originating, I understand originally with Cyrus Vance and he has asked us to take a special moment in our service to offer a prayer for the safety of the hostages who are in Iran.
[time=1507] We don't often respond to the governmental communiques, but I believe this is one to which we ought to respond and I'm going to ask that you join with me and stand together with me as in a special prayer. We pray for these are fellow Americans who are away from home at this time.
[time=1527] Our Father in Heaven, we come into thy presence from the safety of this place of gathering,
[time=1533] mindful that the freedom that allows us to be here was purchased at great price by Americans who have gone before us.
[time=1541] We believe that perhaps more than ever before in the recent history of our country, many of those freedoms are at stake, and we would pray first of all that you would give courage to the leaders in our government that they might do what is right, give them wisdom to know what acts and decisions need to be made.
[time=1559] Pray, O Father, that they will do what would be in keeping with thy will at this time.
[time=1565] We do not underestimate the importance of one life and we know that the lives of Americans are greatly in jeopardy right now
[time=1575] in the Muslim part of our world and especially in Iran at this particular hour.
[time=1581] We pray for the hostages who are being held against their will in the United States Embassy there.
[time=1588] We ask that you will keep them safe and watch over them and Lord encourage them as we've prayed already today.
[time=1595] May there be some among them who know the Lord Jesus Christ as personal Savior that they might bring the comfort of hope and encouragement that only can come from a heart that is rightly related to the Lord Jesus.
[time=1606] We ask Lord that if it be thy will there will be a hasty answer to this question and they will be released and allowed to come back home to be with their families.
[time=1615] We thank you for those who have been released.
[time=1618] We pray that you will demonstrate your strong hand in the behalf of these children of America
[time=1626] who are away from home and will give you the praise in Jesus name and for his sake.
[time=1631] Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1636] Our Bibles are open this morning to the second book of Corinthians chapter 9.
[time=1641] Second Corinthians chapter 9.
[time=1644] One of the most exciting principles, one of the most exciting laws in all of the Bible is the focus of our study today.
[time=1652] It is God's harvest law and it is a law which is inviolate.
[time=1657] It works in the world of nature and it works in the world of the spiritual.
[time=1663] It works in the real world of spiritual realities just as really as it works in the real world
[time=1671] of agriculture and in the sowing and harvest which we know so much about in the farming community.
[time=1679] God has taken this inviolate law and has used it to demonstrate how it works in the realm of the stewardship of our possessions.
[time=1690] We come down to the concluding days of our stewardship month here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1695] There is no greater truth that I could communicate to you than God's harvest law and its application to your life.
[time=1703] We begin our reading in the ninth chapter of 2 Corinthians and verse 6.
[time=1707] But this I say, "He who soeth sparingly shall reap also sparingly,
[time=1713] and he who soeth bountifully shall reap also bountifully, and every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity for God loves a cheerful giver, and God is able to make all grace abound toward you that you always having all sufficiency and all things may abound to every good work.
[time=1732] As it is written, he hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness remaineth forever.
[time=1737] Now he that ministered seed to the sower, both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown,
[time=1743] and increase the fruits of your righteousness, being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeeth through us thanksgiving to God.
[time=1751] For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God.
[time=1759] While by the proving of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ,
[time=1765] and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men, and by their prayer for you who long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[time=1777] Now the principles that are involved in God's harvest law are four.
[time=1783] First of all, as we understand this principle in this passage of Scripture, let us notice the four principles of God's harvest law.
[time=1792] Think with me for a moment of a seed.
[time=1796] It is small, nothing much to look at, but yet within it are contained the principles of life which have never yet been able to be duplicated by scientists.
[time=1810] This little seed which is not much to look at when sown in the proper environment burst forth with life
[time=1818] and multiplies itself time and time again in reproduction.
[time=1824] The first principle of God's harvest law is this. It is the principle of investment.
[time=1830] In this passage of Scripture God is talking about sowing and reaping, and He takes that continuity of sowing and reaping and applies it to a spiritual realm.
[time=1841] Sowing is equal to giving according to this passage. In verse 6 He says if you sow sparingly, you reap sparingly.
[time=1849] Then in verse 7 He interchanges that concept with the word give.
[time=1853] Every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give, sowing and giving are alike.
[time=1858] And reaping comes back in both of these realms as we understand God's harvest law.
[time=1863] The first of the four principles of God's harvest law is this. It is the principle of investment.
[time=1870] That little seed which we envision in our hands is a beautiful thing to look at.
[time=1875] We can put it on our mantle and admire it. We can drill a hole in it and put it around our neck as some of the young people might be prone to do. We can put it in those little things that the women use to beautify their knickknack shells and we can examine it and say, "My isn't it beautiful?" We can learn all about it. We can paint it. We can dye it. We can do all we want to with it.
[time=1895] But it is a worthless thing until first of all it is invested in the ground.
[time=1900] It is not enough to know about it or to examine it. It is no use whatsoever to the farmer until first of all it is sown.
[time=1908] It must be invested.
[time=1911] It is interesting to me that we may have all the money in the world but God can't do anything to bless it and crease it and cause it to multiply in our own lives until first of all we understand the principle of investing.
[time=1923] That's why God calls giving sowing. It must be invested. It must be given.
[time=1928] Now the principle of sowing and reaping is something that is common throughout all of the scripture.
[time=1933] It is used to explain many spiritual truths.
[time=1937] For instance, when Jesus Christ came down to this earth the Bible tells us that He was sown into this world.
[time=1944] In fact over in the 12th chapter of the book of John in verse 24 we are told these words concerning the Lord Jesus.
[time=1951] Verily, verily, I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die in a bite of the loan.
[time=1960] But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit. That in reference to the Lord Jesus what does it mean?
[time=1966] It means unless He had come down to this earth and died upon the cross and gone into the ground being buried
[time=1972] and come forth in resurrection He would have remained alone the Son of God.
[time=1977] But because He was willing to be sown into the ground and die and come forth in resurrection
[time=1983] He is the first fruits of those that slept and one day He will bring many sons into glory with Him.
[time=1988] The principle of sowing and reaping.
[time=1991] Now the first principle of God's harvest law is this.
[time=1994] You must sow in order to reap. You must invest what God has given to you.
[time=2000] Some of you today are wondering why God hasn't blessed you more financially.
[time=2003] Why he hasn't blessed you more in terms of the things you're looking for in your own spiritual life.
[time=2008] It's a very simple process to examine. You're going to get in proportion to your sowing.
[time=2012] And if you're not sowing don't look for any reaping.
[time=2015] Because the principle of investment in God's greater law of harvest is in violence.
[time=2020] You cannot violate it and prosper.
[time=2024] The second principle that I want you to note is this.
[time=2027] The principle of identity. You not only get when you sow, you get what you sow.
[time=2033] No farmer that I know of sows soybeans in the ground and then takes his corn harvester out into the field in the fall
[time=2042] and tries to harvest corn out of a soybean field.
[time=2045] He knows that the locked in principle of identity is in the seed.
[time=2050] And what you put in the ground by way of a seed is what's going to be harvested out of the ground.
[time=2055] And that principle is transferrable over into the spiritual realm as well.
[time=2060] Let's move for a moment away from the area of finances and just into the area of life in general.
[time=2065] You say to me this morning, "Pastor, I wish there was more love demonstrated toward me." Well, I'll tell you how to reap love in your life so a little bit of it.
[time=2072] If you sow love, you'll reap love.
[time=2075] Someone says to me, "I wish people would appreciate me more than they do." Well, let me tell you how to get appreciated.
[time=2080] You sow a little appreciation to others and you'll discover that when you sow appreciation, you reap appreciation.
[time=2086] Someone says to me, "I wish I had more joy." Well, if you weren't so sour faced and going around making life miserable for everybody and you sowed a little joy in the life of someone else, maybe you'd get some joy back.
[time=2097] I wish people were more thankful to me for all that I do.
[time=2100] So a little Thanksgiving.
[time=2101] The Bible says we reap what we sow.
[time=2104] Turn in your Bibles to the 41st Psalm.
[time=2107] Here is an illustration that is a very blessed truth as it relates to the whole concept of sowing and reaping.
[time=2115] We not only get when we sow, we get what we sow.
[time=2118] And in Psalm 41, we read this truth concerning the sowing of consideration for others.
[time=2124] Blessed is he that considereth the poor.
[time=2129] The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.
[time=2132] The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
[time=2140] The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing.
[time=2143] Thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
[time=2145] What is he saying?
[time=2146] If you want consideration in your time of trouble, maybe you ought to sow a little consideration.
[time=2151] Now that's the positive aspect of the principle and I guarantee you that it works.
[time=2155] It's not the Dale Carnegie approach to life.
[time=2159] It is God's approach to life.
[time=2161] But the negative part of that is also a working principle in our lives.
[time=2166] You wonder why there's so much hate in your home?
[time=2168] Well, how much hate are you sowing?
[time=2170] You're going to get what you reap.
[time=2172] You wonder why your kids are so antagonistic and so nasty and so rotten to you?
[time=2176] Well, maybe you ought to examine what you're sowing in their lives.
[time=2179] Are you sowing any love for them?
[time=2181] Or are you sowing that which is reaping back into your hands the result of your sowing?
[time=2186] You sow discord in the church?
[time=2188] You know what you'll get?
[time=2190] You'll get discord in your own life and probably you'll be off in some of the church someplace sowing discord before long.
[time=2196] The Bible says you get what you sow.
[time=2198] What you're going to get out of it is what you put into it.
[time=2201] And that principle is not one that can be violated and prosperity be yours.
[time=2209] The principle of investment and the principle of identity.
[time=2213] You get when you sow, you get what you sow, but I want you to notice thirdly the principle of increase.
[time=2220] You not only get when you sow and you get what you sow, but you get more than you sow.
[time=2226] Now, you say that's a ridiculous thing for you to be saying.
[time=2229] Obviously, you get more than you sow.
[time=2231] If you didn't get more than you sowed, what would be the reason for sowing?
[time=2235] If you put a grain of corn in the ground and you only got one back out, why not keep the grain in the first place?
[time=2241] If God isn't going to bless your investment in like identity with an increase, why sow?
[time=2247] The Bible says when you sow, you reap and there is an increase.
[time=2251] Someone has said that for one grain of corn sown in the ground, two to three thousand grains are reproduced on one corn stock that comes from the principle of life locked up in that little kernel.
[time=2262] That little kernel shoots its roots downward and its plant upwards and the corn ears grow upon the stock and the ratio is somewhere between one to two thousand and one to three thousand.
[time=2273] That's an increase.
[time=2275] That's the principle of increase that God is talking about.
[time=2278] If you sow a little, you're going to reap a lot.
[time=2283] The more you sow, the more you get, but the principle is one of increase.
[time=2287] That's why Luke chapter six and verse 38 says this, "Give and it shall be given unto you.
[time=2292] Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap for with whatever measure you give to others, it will be dealt out to you." Now that's an agricultural statement.
[time=2305] I like it because it's a tremendous truth.
[time=2307] It says if you give, what God is going to do is to measure out to you in good measure according to your giving.
[time=2315] And then he uses this illustration.
[time=2317] It is good measure.
[time=2318] It is pressed down.
[time=2320] And then in case there's any air between the kernels of corn, it is shaken together so that it all settles down and then it is running over back into your life.
[time=2330] The Bible says that the principle of increase is operative in God's harvest law.
[time=2335] You sow a little, you reap a lot.
[time=2337] You sow a little bit more, you reap a lot more.
[time=2340] Now this passage is filled with illustrations of that.
[time=2344] In chapters eight and nine there is a term which is used over and over again.
[time=2348] It is the translation of a Greek term.
[time=2350] It is the term bountiful, abundant, bounty, and it is a term which means increase.
[time=2356] A bound, have plenty of more than enough to provide in abundance.
[time=2361] And if you'll go back with me in chapters eight and nine and take a quick survey, you'll discover that this chapter which talks about sowing and reaping, this whole context is filled with the truth of God's abundant supply for those who will sow.
[time=2375] In chapter eight and verse two, we're talking about the abundance of their joy and abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
[time=2383] In chapter nine and verse six we read these words, but this I say so sparingly, reap sparingly, so bountifully, reap bountifully.
[time=2392] Notice verse eight.
[time=2394] Here is one of the greatest promises in all of the Bible.
[time=2397] It is filled with superlatives.
[time=2399] I like to read it, to emphasize the superlatives.
[time=2402] If you haven't underlined them in your Bible, you need to do it.
[time=2405] Listen carefully to what God promises to those who will sow in his harvest field.
[time=2410] Notice what he says, but God is able to make all grace, a bound toward you that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things,
[time=2420] may abound to every good work.
[time=2423] That is a superlative statement which says when you sow God's way, you're going to reap a great increase in your own life, both spiritually and I believe financially.
[time=2433] Sowing and reaping, the principle of investment, you're going to get when you sow.
[time=2439] The principle of identity, you're going to get what you sow.
[time=2443] By the way, the book of Galatians tells us if you sow to the flesh, you reap corruption.
[time=2447] If you sow to the spirit, you reap life everlasting.
[time=2450] Corruption is not just a term which means moral decay.
[time=2453] It just means that it's not going to last past this life.
[time=2456] If you decide to take all of your goods and sow them to the things of this life, you have just gone into the junk business.
[time=2463] If you don't believe me, you go up in your attic or go out in your garage.
[time=2466] I clean out our garage Friday and I'll tell you what, we're more in the junk business and I thought we were.
[time=2472] We've been sowing to corruption.
[time=2475] You know what that means?
[time=2476] That means those things aren't going to last past this life.
[time=2478] You sow in that realm, that's what you're going to get.
[time=2480] You sow in the other realm, you're going to get life everlasting.
[time=2483] You get what you sow, you get when you sow, you get more than you sow.
[time=2488] But I want you to notice, fortunately, the principle of interval.
[time=2491] You get when you sow, you get what you sow, you get more than you sow.
[time=2497] But you get after you sow.
[time=2501] There's a principle of interval.
[time=2503] You don't put it in the ground in the morning and go out and harvest it at night.
[time=2506] No farmer ever does that.
[time=2508] Some of them would like to do it, I'm certain, but there's no way to do it because God's harvest law has in it the principle of interval that there's a sowing and there's a reaping and there's a time interval in between.
[time=2519] And it's my estimation that one of the reasons why God's people aren't more faithful in being involved in the principle of sowing and reaping is because they don't understand this principle.
[time=2530] They want their investment to bear fruit immediately.
[time=2533] They'll come to stewardship month, make a commitment to give, and after the first month, if they haven't seen a great increase in their own lives, in every respect, they'll say, "Well, I knew that preacher was full of baloney anyway.
[time=2543] I didn't believe it when he said it.
[time=2544] I thought it was worth the try, but I know it doesn't work." The Bible says that you sow now and you reap later.
[time=2552] And I'm fully convinced to the fact that some of us won't really know what our harvest is for many weeks and months and years.
[time=2558] If you get involved in being involved in God's priorities with your life and with your giving and with your substance, you may not know the full harvest until your children are full grown.
[time=2568] And they come back to tell you it was your commitment to God's priorities when I was growing up in this home that gave me the stability that I needed to go out and be the kind of person God wanted me to be.
[time=2578] Is that a harvest?
[time=2579] I'll tell you what, there are men and women in this church who would pay every time they could earn for the rest of their lives if they could just buy that kind of harvest and enjoy it during this time.
[time=2590] I'm not saying you buy God's favor, but I am saying this.
[time=2593] When you demonstrate that you're involved with the priorities of God, you get in on God's plan of reaping and sowing, but it takes some time.
[time=2602] And that's why we read over in Galatians chapter 6 and verse 9, a very considerate passage that is parallel to this one, these words.
[time=2610] Listen to what Paul said to the Galatians in the same context of reaping and sowing.
[time=2615] He said, "Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season what?
[time=2621] We shall reap if we faint not." You know what it means to faint?
[time=2624] It means to get discouraged and lose heart, to give up.
[time=2628] Paul says, "Let us not be weary in sowing." I come to church every week, they pass the offering plate morning and evening.
[time=2636] All I do is sow, where is it?
[time=2638] Paul said, "Don't get weary in sowing, for in due season you will reap if you don't get discouraged." But if you get discouraged and stop sowing, you shut down the harvest in the future.
[time=2648] Men and women, there is the principle of interval between the sowing and the reaping.
[time=2652] You can't deny it, you can't violate it.
[time=2654] You must, in faith, be leaving, do the sowing, even though you don't always see the harvest immediately.
[time=2660] But because you believe God said to you so, you do it, and you trust God for the harvest, which you know is coming, though you know not when.
[time=2668] In the book of Ecclesiastes in chapter 11 verse 1, we're told to cast our bread upon the waters.
[time=2674] And after many days, it will come back to us.
[time=2677] There's a great promise in the book of Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10, which is given to spiritual workers.
[time=2684] Some of you are investing your lives in the Lord's work, your money, your time, your effort.
[time=2688] You say, "Well, I wonder if God knows, is he keeping good records up there in the harvest center?" I considerately believe that God keeps such good records that if he doesn't know everything
[time=2701] we're doing, that it is a denial of his person as God.
[time=2705] And listen to what Paul says in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 10.
[time=2710] "For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work, and the love which you have shown in
[time=2717] his name, and having ministered and still ministering to the saints." Did you hear that?
[time=2722] The Bible says that God's justice is at stake in terms of his harvest law, that when you
[time=2729] sow, God knows it, and he will not be unjust to forget all of your labor in ministering
[time=2735] to and with the saints, one day on the basis of your labor and your investment, there will be a harvest.
[time=2741] How do you know that?
[time=2742] The very standard of God's name is at stake.
[time=2746] His justice is at stake, and he will not forget.
[time=2749] Men may forget, I might forget, your fellow church members might forget, your family might
[time=2755] forget, but God doesn't forget.
[time=2757] He keeps good records.
[time=2758] And what you sow, you reap.
[time=2761] God said that.
[time=2763] Well these are the four principles.
[time=2765] We get when we sow, the principle of investment.
[time=2772] We get more than we sow, the principle of increase, and we get later than we sow, the principle of interval.
[time=2781] But what happens when we sow?
[time=2785] What takes place?
[time=2786] We've talked about the principles.
[time=2787] Let me talk for just a moment about the products.
[time=2790] If you say, "Pastor Jeremiah, let's just suppose," and this is a beautiful supposition, causes me to think, "I've died and gone to heaven when I think of this," let's just suppose that every person who attends this church, every member of this church determines by the
[time=2806] grace of God they're going to be faithful in their stewardship and give to God as God has instructed them in the sowing, reaping principle.
[time=2814] Someone has said if the average Baptist church would all lose their jobs and go on welfare, the offerings of the church would go up 40% if they'd just tithe.
[time=2822] I don't know if that's true or not, I don't think that's true here.
[time=2826] But I'll tell you what, I'll share with you what would happen if every member of this church would begin to do what God has instructed them to do in terms of giving.
[time=2835] All the people who are listening to my voice would begin to be faithful with that which God has given them for the purpose of sowing and reaping.
[time=2841] In this passage there are a number of things He promises at six, at least.
[time=2846] Most of all He promises that we would spiritually and financially prosper.
[time=2850] He will prosper us spiritually and financially.
[time=2853] Notice verse eight, "God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that having all sufficiency in all things you may abound to every good work.
[time=2861] That word, at verse, has one word spelled right across the face of prosperity.
[time=2866] It has prosperity financially and spiritually, for it means increasing and working, increasing
[time=2872] and working.
[time=2873] It has financial stability and here is spiritual stability." Notice verse 10, "Now He that minister seed to the sower minister bread for your food
[time=2883] and multiply your seed sown." What is God doing here?
[time=2887] He's using the principle of multiplication and He is taking what you sow and multiplying it so that it comes back to you so that it can be reinvested.
[time=2897] Notice verse 10, verse 11, "Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which cause it through us thanksgiving to God, enriched in everything." What does that mean?
[time=2906] It means growth, financially and spiritually.
[time=2908] The first thing you will discover when you get involved in God's harvest law is that you will prosper spiritually and I believe financially.
[time=2916] That's the truth of God's word.
[time=2919] The second thing that you will discover is that you will prove your confession to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2924] I want you to read with me in your own Bibles verse 13.
[time=2927] Read it in your own way as I read it aloud.
[time=2930] All by the proving of this ministration, now notice, they glorify God for your professed
[time=2938] subjection unto the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2942] What is He saying?
[time=2943] He's saying that when they saw the Corinthians commitment in giving, in sowing, they said
[time=2949] that demonstrates the reality of their confession of Jesus Christ.
[time=2954] I may have been in doubt before on the basis of what they said, but I have seen their good works and now I know that these people really believe what they're saying.
[time=2964] Paul was saying in his day, what I hear said in this day, he put your money where your mouth is.
[time=2970] You say, "Boy, that's crass and undignified." Well, you know, there's so many people in our churches who like to give and stand and give long and flowing testimonies about how they love Jesus and how wonderful it is to be involved in God's work and how wonderful it is to be a Christian.
[time=2986] But when you get down to the reality of their personal stewardship to God, which the Bible says is an opportunity for us to prove the reality of our love, you can't find them.
[time=2997] And God says, "If we love Him, we'll keep His commandments, and if we're involved in His ministry, we ought to be involved in such a tangible way that we demonstrate that love.
[time=3008] It's easy for me to say, "Oh God, I love you.
[time=3011] It's not as easy for me to take that which I could use for the pleasure of my own person
[time=3017] and right out of that, a substantial amount back into God's work that says, "God, here's my love gift to you.
[time=3022] I'm sowing it in your name so you can have the opportunity to increase it." The Bible says we prove the reality of our love through our giving.
[time=3033] And so if you're talking loudly about how much you love God, you better look at your giving statement, see whether you're telling the truth or not.
[time=3039] The third thing that happens when we give is this.
[time=3042] We not only prosper spiritually and financially, we prove our confession to the gospel of Christ, but we provide for those in need.
[time=3049] Notice verse 12, "For the administration of this service not only supplyeth the want of the saints.
[time=3055] When we give, we meet the needs of God's people, buildings, lights, materials, educational
[time=3062] places to study, all of the things that God's people need to prosper and be edified are supplied when we give.
[time=3069] And on the mission field, the saints of God who minister there, we provide the needs for God's people.
[time=3077] You take for a moment a church and you subtract all of the stewardship out of that church and that church can't function.
[time=3082] We couldn't have Sunday school, we couldn't have church services, there'd be no music, there'd be no involvement in teaching and discipling and all the things that go on because
[time=3092] the want of the saints would be gone.
[time=3095] That is the provision that comes when we invest in God's work.
[time=3098] That's the third thing.
[time=3099] We prosper spiritually and financially, we prove the confession of our love to Christ, we provide for those in need.
[time=3105] Here's one that's exciting.
[time=3107] We provoke many thanksgivings to God.
[time=3110] You know this is Thanksgiving season still here and I think one of the things we ought to look at is how we can cause thanksgiving to happen over and over again.
[time=3117] Notice in verses 11, 12 and 15 the theme of thanksgiving is prevalent.
[time=3122] Verse 11 says, "When we give," Paul is writing, he say, "you cause through us thanksgiving to God." Paul said, "When you gave and I saw what you gave, I gave thanks to God." Notice in verse 12, "For the administration of this service supplied to one of the saints, but it is abundant by many thanksgivings unto God." What is he talking about?
[time=3141] Paul said, "You gave the money, I saw what you gave and I thanked God." Then the money was passed on to those in need.
[time=3146] They got it and what did they do?
[time=3148] They thanked God.
[time=3149] So many thanksgivings went up to heaven because of the gifts that God's people gave and then
[time=3155] in last verse it says, "Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift." What I want you to understand is this, that when we give, we set in motion a chain reaction that causes spiritual things to happen everywhere.
[time=3167] The missionaries give thanks, the people who are saved gets thanks, the families that are encouraged and educated give thanks and the whole spirit of thanksgiving goes up to heaven because we've invested and we've sown and we're reaping the byproducts of the sowing and reaping principle.
[time=3184] Then once you notice that you promote prayer on your behalf, verse 14, and last but not
[time=3190] least, you purchase greater opportunity to give.
[time=3194] I've been interested to learn in verse 8 and verse 10 that the purpose of God's increasing
[time=3200] the blessing upon us is so that we can give more.
[time=3204] So I really never saw that quite so clearly, but read verse 8 with me now and notice what the text says.
[time=3209] God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that you always having all sufficiency
[time=3215] and all things may be able to buy everything that you ever wanted.
[time=3219] Is that what it says?
[time=3222] That's why a lot of Christians read it, "Boy, God has blessed me with all sufficiency and all things.
[time=3227] I got everything I need so I can just go out and get whatever I wanted." Notice the text says that the purpose for God's blessing in our lives is in order that we might abound to every good work.
[time=3241] That means that when God blesses us financially, the only reason for it is so that we can get involved in helping more to do God's work.
[time=3248] And I'll tell you something, men and women, there is no reason for God's blessing materially upon His children except for the purpose of enhancing His work because God is not a materialist.
[time=3261] God is not interested in making materialists out of His children.
[time=3264] He will only bless us if we will take what He gives us and reinvest it in the things of God so that the work of God can grow.
[time=3272] Now I've read this passage over and over again and studied it and let its truth sink through in my own heart.
[time=3277] I believe this is one of the most dynamic principles in the Bible.
[time=3281] God's harvest law, we get what we sow, we reap what we sow.
[time=3287] For many years as I read this passage, I would come to the end of the text and I would read that statement about thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.
[time=3295] And I would think, well there's Paul, he's done it again.
[time=3297] You know how Paul taught, he would be writing along in his writings and really down to business and all of a sudden he'd get so excited, he'd burst forth and praise to the Lord and have a little parentheses in his books.
[time=3307] Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift.
[time=3311] But for the first time I began to see that that last verse belongs in this passage.
[time=3316] You know why?
[time=3317] One day God looked down from heaven before the world began and he said, I'd like to reap
[time=3323] many sons to glory.
[time=3326] I'd like to have many children come and live with me someday.
[time=3330] God created man and man's sin for soot God's plan and God never lost sight of his desire
[time=3338] to have many sons come to glory.
[time=3341] And so because God not only set in motion the harvest law but deeply believes in it and practices it in his own life, God said one day I will have to do something in order
[time=3352] that I might reap many sons to glory.
[time=3355] He looked around heaven for someone to invest and he saw the face of his blessed son the Lord Jesus and he said I will do it.
[time=3362] I will sow my son into this world and I will let him go into the ground and die and because
[time=3369] of his death I will reap many sons to glory myself.
[time=3375] Let's be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[time=3378] It was God's gift to this world, his sowing of his own son into this world that makes it possible for you and for me to be a part of that which Paul wrote about in Hebrews chapter two when he said for it became him for whom all things and by whom are all things
[time=3394] in bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
[time=3400] sufferings.
[time=3401] God in heaven invested his own son Jesus Christ sowed him into this world and the result of
[time=3409] that is the multiplication of that son into many sons and we now are able to be with him
[time=3415] forever for eternity.
