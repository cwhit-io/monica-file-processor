[time=14] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=25] [ Singing ]
[time=48] And all God's people said.
[time=50] We welcome you to this service, which is the second morning service
[time=59] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=61] And we're thankful for all of you who have gathered here to share with us in this hour.
[time=66] And we're grateful for the privilege we have of extending the ministry of this hour beyond these walls by use of television.
[time=73] And so we welcome all of those who are joining us now in their homes and many of the elderly folks share this service
[time=83] with us and some of the elderly care centers around our city and in other places.
[time=87] And so we know our congregation is gathered all over this area this morning and we're grateful for the privilege of ministering the Word of God.
[time=95] In the Old Testament, there is a Psalm, Psalm 103, which says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me,
[time=106] bless His holy name." Our choir has chosen that theme for their anthem this morning and please listen to the sanctuary choir in the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=118] [MUSIC - "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me,
[time=138] bless His holy name, bless His holy name,
[time=150] bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits,
[time=162] who forgive us all thy inequities, who heal us all thy diseases,
[time=179] who retain us thy life from destruction,
[time=186] who proud that we live with loving kindness and tender mercy."
[time=206] "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me,
[time=219] bless His holy name, bless His holy name,
[time=275] thank you, choir.
[time=280] When we receive letters from folks who share our service by television, we often have folks who ask us why we don't sing more of the older songs.
[time=289] They like some of the old standard songs that have been sung down through the ages.
[time=294] We like both the old and the new.
[time=296] Any means of praising God is a good vehicle to offer up our praise to Him.
[time=301] But I have to agree that some of the older songs are some of the most beautiful.
[time=305] When set in a proper setting can really bring blessing to your own life.
[time=310] Star Narwald usually sings a contemporary song because that's the style that she has developed,
[time=316] but today she's chosen to sing one of those old songs.
[time=320] And I'm sure you recognize it, so listen carefully.
[time=324] I come to the garden alone, while the dew is still on the roses,
[time=348] and the voice I hear falling on my ear.
[time=357] The son of God glows and he walks with me and he talks with me,
[time=375] and he tells me I am his own.
[time=383] And the joy we share as we teary there,
[time=391] is none other has ever known.
[time=406] He speaks, and the sound of his voice is so sweet,
[time=418] the birds hush their singing,
[time=424] and the melody that he gave to me within.
[time=435] My heart is ringing, oh, and he walks with me,
[time=449] and he talks with me, and he tells me I am his own.
[time=461] And the joy that we share as we teary there,
[time=474] none other has ever known.
[time=486] We certainly are grateful for the opportunity we have to share the Bible hour with you,
[time=509] our friends at home.
[time=511] One of the real joys that Don and I have as we serve together in this ministry is the opportunity to share the mail that comes in each week; a mail that gives us feedback
[time=522] reminding us that there are actually real people out there who are part of this ministry and share it with us on a weekly basis.
[time=529] One of the exciting things that we are hearing now very regularly in the mail, Donna, is a response to the regular Bible study program that has been initiated in the lives of many of our television viewers.
[time=540] And I know you have some letters that are responding to the Bible study, why don't you share a couple of them with us?
[time=546] We have received so many of them, and even when you run into people on the street they talk about the daily walk, but just a couple of excerpts this morning we'd like to share with you.
[time=556] This person writes, "I am enjoying the daily walk Bible study booklet very much.
[time=561] I have read the Bible through before, but find there is so much I didn't understand.
[time=566] I just didn't study it in the right way." And then from another viewer they write, "Want to let you know I am enjoying the daily walk.
[time=575] It makes studying the Bible so much easier for me to follow and also to understand it."
[time=581] Donna, I know that the Bible study booklet that we send out has been used of God to help
[time=588] many people become faithful and regular in their Bible study habits, because it offers them the opportunity on a regular daily basis to plan out how they're going to read
[time=599] the Scripture.
[time=600] For instance, in the February issue which begins a study in the book of Leviticus, there is an overview of all of the sacrifices that are involved in that Old Testament book as well as an introduction to the book, and it gives people perspective as they read.
[time=615] One of the real problems in reading the Bible is having the proper motivation to read it and having the information that you need and knowing what you're prepared to read as you
[time=625] get into the Word of God is a great help in that motivational problem.
[time=629] Then of course in the middle of the book there's a checklist where you can check every passage that you read and we encourage our readers to send their checklist back into us and we keep track of them and award a certificate at the end of the year for those who've read through the Bible in a year's time.
[time=644] We'd like to encourage you to get involved in the daily walk.
[time=647] It's a great plan to read through the Bible in a year with meaning and understanding.
[time=652] The way you do that is by writing to us here at the Bible Hour Office and requesting your free copy, and Donna, the way that they do that is by addressing the letter in the proper manner.
[time=664] All you need to do is just drop a note to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 150450 Fort
[time=671] Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and let us know that you're interested in getting started and reading
[time=677] through the Bible and we'll be happy to send you a copy of the daily walk and let you know how you can continue to get it.
[time=684] Donna, when they're writing for the daily walk I hope that if they haven't already received it they will ask for the answer book which is a study tool that Christians are finding helpful in their daily lives.
[time=696] It's a very small booklet filled with Bible verses that are arranged topically around some of the more common problems of our generation.
[time=704] These verses are in this booklet written out completely so that when you carry it with you
[time=710] in your purse or pocket you have it readily available at the time of need.
[time=714] The answer book is one of the free Bible study helps that we're glad to send to our friends and all you have to do is ask for it and we'll be happy to send it to you this week.
[time=723] Once again the address that you need to use when you write for the answer book or for the daily walk is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 150250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=734] We're so very grateful for the people who help us in getting the gospel out through television.
[time=741] It takes many hundreds of people working together, sacrificially praying and giving so that the Bible hour can reach the people in the many areas where it is telecast.
[time=752] This past week Donna I flew over Chicago and it was a clear day and I could see the many hundreds of homes and it just struck me at the very core of my being that the Bible hour
[time=764] was available to every single one of those homes and that that is because people have given and sacrificed to make it possible and in that particular area the Bible hour goes out every Sunday into those homes and one of the ways that people help us do that is
[time=780] through the sponsors program, a program whereby individuals, families sponsor all or a portion
[time=787] of a program in their given area on a specific Sunday either in their own name or in honor of someone else and I know you have a list of associate sponsors that you want to share today, people who are helping us get the gospel out on this particular Sunday.
[time=803] We have a number of associate sponsors today, Mr. and Mrs. Don Johnson who are channel 40
[time=809] viewers, Charmaine Bauer who is in Fort Wayne, Edward and Anna Fenneman and on channel 38
[time=818] I hope I'm pronouncing these names correctly. Mrs. Faye Hilliard also a Fort Wayne and
[time=825] Irma Jean Faison who views on channel 38 and we certainly thank you folks and appreciate
[time=831] so much your willingness to help us get the good news of the gospel out in your area.
[time=838] Donna, people may be interested in knowing how they can be a part of the sponsors program and if they're interested we'd be happy to give them the information if they'll just write to us and let us know. Once again the address that you need to use when you write is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. I hope you'll
[time=859] stay tuned now as we open the word of God again to the book of Colossians and actually begin our verse by verse study of this great book today talking about the people and the place and a place where God worked in a mighty way, the city of Colossi and the letter that
[time=877] Paul wrote to that city to encourage them and as he encouraged them he encourages us.
[time=883] We'll be getting into the word in just a moment. We thank you for being a part of this telecast. May God bless you as you continue to be ministered to by this program.
[time=900] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=930] Last night, Pastor and myself and the Black Hawk Singers, my wife were down at the Bethesda
[time=936] Baptist Church in Brownsburg, Indiana where our television program is viewed. We had the
[time=942] privilege of ministering down there in their missionary and stewardship banquet. One of the songs the Black Hawk singer sang was this song. It is applicable to our lives whether
[time=953] we're thinking of missions or stewardship or daily living. The name of it is, it is
[time=959] well with my soul.
[time=989] It is well, it is well, it is well, it is well, it is well, it is well, it is well,
[time=1019] it is well, with my soul, with my soul, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1038] My sin, oh the bliss of that glorious thought, my sin not in part but the whole.
[time=1060] His nail to the cross and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord for my soul.
[time=1083] And Lord, raise the day when my faith shall be slight. The clouds be rolled back as a scroll.
[time=1099] O Lord from bent shall sound and the Lord shall listen, even so, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1122] It is well, with my soul, it is well, it is well, it is well, with my soul.
[time=1149] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers. One of the ways that we make sure that that is always true
[time=1175] in our lives is by keeping short accounts with God. The Bible tells us that we can come
[time=1182] to the Lord any time in any situation and bring to Him our confession of sin. We read
[time=1190] in 1 John 1 9 that if we as Christians confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and cleanses from all unrighteousness. I have never yet met a Christian who didn't
[time=1201] need to apply that truth in his own life once in a while. In fact, that same book of John says that if we say we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves. David Miller, who is a
[time=1212] member of the Black Hawk Singers, has found a song that pictures a penitent coming back
[time=1218] to get into fellowship with the Lord, seeking for forgiveness. And every Christian here,
[time=1224] I am sure, will identify with this in some way or another because we have all been on that road. Thank God for the forgiveness of sin. And let's listen as David shares that truth with us.
[time=1258] "I need to be done. I should have come to you the moment that I knew, that I would
[time=1269] fall. I needed help to get me through. Forgive me, Lord. I fell. I lost my way again.
[time=1287] Forgive me, Lord. I really didn't try. Please help me, Lord. Your spirit in me suffered
[time=1303] this. Oh, come and help me. Oh, please forgive me, Lord. I like to think I have control
[time=1324] of all I do and say. But then I fall again. Oh, Lord, please come and show the way. I need
[time=1336] you close to me. I need you by my side, so I won't fall again. Oh, Lord, you be my guide.
[time=1354] Forgive me, Lord. I fell. I lost my way again. Forgive me, Lord. I really didn't
[time=1368] try. Please help me, Lord. Your spirit in me suffered this. Oh, come and help me. Oh,
[time=1383] please forgive me, Lord. Oh, come and help me. Oh, please forgive me, Lord. Forgive me.
[time=1407] Thank you, David, and he always will. That's the wonderful thing about it. We can come
[time=1423] to him honestly in prayer, and he will forgive. We're studying together the book of Colossians
[time=1429] in the New Testament. And today we read in our study the first eight verses of the first
[time=1436] chapter, Colossians chapter one and verses one through eight. And if you do not have a
[time=1443] Bible, someone next to you will share theirs with you so you can read along with us. We
[time=1449] believe in studying the Word of God together when we meet as Christians. That's the food for our souls, and it encourages us to grow and be what we ought to be before God. And so the textbook we bring to class is the Word of God. How many Bibles are there here today? Let me see them. Would you raise them up? Almost everyone has a textbook, and we're glad to have you here with your Bible in hand, and I trust that you'll study along with us as we open God's Word together. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy
[time=1482] our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae. Grace be unto
[time=1489] you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God and
[time=1495] the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith
[time=1501] in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the Word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it death also in you since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth. As you also learned
[time=1522] of Epiphras, our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. Let's pray together.
[time=1535] Father, we thank you for your Word and for this very precious letter which has been given to us a letter from the heart of the great apostle to a church that he had never seen
[time=1546] with his own eyes but a church which was being pastored by a friend who was a friend indeed
[time=1553] and a fellow servant in Christ. We thank you that the instruction given to the church at Colossae is still good word for us today and we pray that we'll understand it and that
[time=1563] we'll take it to heart, that we'll open our minds and our lives to this truth, that it
[time=1569] might not simply be an experience of hearing and going away to forget but that having heard
[time=1575] it will indelibly make its mark upon our lives that we'll be different men and women for we pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1585] I was going through some boxes in our basement a few weeks ago. That's an unholy job for
[time=1592] anyone to do but ever once in a while my wife tells me it needs to be done and I was looking for some textbooks that Donna needed for a class she teaches in our high school and
[time=1603] as I uncovered the boxes and began to dig through them I came in one box to a stack
[time=1610] of letters about that high with some rubber bands around them and I opened up one of the letters and lo and behold it was all of the letters that I had written to Donna during
[time=1621] the time we were going together and while we were going together during one year I was traveling with the gospel quartet all over the United States out in the East and out in the West. Every day I wrote a letter to Donna, their postmarks on those letters from almost everywhere and I had never seen all of those letters together in one bundle before
[time=1642] and I frankly couldn't believe that I ever did that, that I had ever written so many letters to one person. I did it one day at a time and I did it because I had great love in my heart for and still do but I have to admit that I'm glad the letter writing days are over. I'd so much rather be with her in person, letters are all right if you can't
[time=1663] be with someone but they're an awful poor substitute for personal fellowship. I read in the Guinness Book of Records that the longest letter ever written was 3,200 feet long, more
[time=1675] than six tenths of a mile in length. It was written on an adding machine roll over a period
[time=1682] of a month in 1954 by Miss Louise Gordon of Brooklyn, New York City to U.S. Army Private
[time=1689] Don Reese in Korea. Now that is dedication and I don't think if I put all my letters
[time=1696] to Donna end to end it would make a letter that long but here's someone who wrote one longer than all of mine put together. She did it obviously because she had love for the person at the other end of the communication cycle. I have been amazed as I've studied the
[time=1712] life of Paul to discover the great ministry God gave him through the writing of letters.
[time=1719] In fact we would know very little about the apostle had he not preserved had had the Holy Spirit not preserved for us the letters which he wrote not only to the churches but to his
[time=1731] sons in the faith Timothy and Titus and all of the pastoral epistles which have his name
[time=1737] upon them and we are enriched today because the apostle took pen in hand and communicated
[time=1743] to the brethren in writing. Now as we gave our introductory message last week we learned
[time=1749] that the reason Paul wrote to the church in Colossae was because he had never had the privilege of seeing them face to face. He did not start that church he had never been
[time=1759] in Colossae but he wrote to them on the report of their pastor a young man by the name of
[time=1765] Epifras who came to see Paul while he was in prison in Rome. He brought to Paul the problems
[time=1771] of the Colossian church and Paul rather than send back a word by word of mouth sat down
[time=1778] in his Roman imprisonment and wrote the letter to those Christians and the letter is called
[time=1784] Colossians. Now today we begin our study verse by verse of that letter. Notice first of all
[time=1792] the unique style of writing that was very much a part of the apostolic era. They did not write
[time=1798] letters like we do today. Dear Mr. and Mrs. So and So and then at the bottom signed their name
[time=1805] but they signed their name at the top and then they addressed the letter to the recipient and so we read at the beginning of Paul's letter Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God
[time=1817] and Timothy our brother. Today we're talking about the people that are involved in this communication
[time=1824] process and the first one that we meet as we open the book and begin to read the verses
[time=1830] is Paul and notice what the Bible says about him. The Bible says Paul was an apostle by the will of
[time=1837] God. Now the word apostle is a word which is translated right out of the language of the New
[time=1843] Testament. The word in the New Testament for apostle is apostolos. It comes from a root word
[time=1850] which is translated a number of places in the New Testament documents. For instance in the gospel
[time=1856] of John chapter 17 and verse 18 we read this. As thou hast sent me into the world even so have I
[time=1866] also sent them into the world and when you read the word sent that is the same word which is
[time=1873] translated apostle later on in the New Testament. An apostle then was one who was sent he was a
[time=1881] sent one one who went with a mission from God one who had the stamp of authority upon him to carry
[time=1888] the message of God to a certain group of people and Paul would later say that he was an apostle
[time=1894] born out of due time. He meant by that that whereas all of the other apostles had fellowshiped
[time=1900] personally with the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly ministry he had not had that privilege
[time=1906] but he had met up with Christ in a vision on the road to Damascus. His apostleship was the last
[time=1913] of all the apostleships he was one born out of due time the least of all the apostles according to
[time=1919] his own statement. But notice carefully that Paul says he was an apostle by the will of God. He does
[time=1927] not tell us that he was an apostle because a counsel declared him to be such he was not put into the
[time=1933] apostleship because of a church hierarchy that thrust him into the job he was not even an apostle
[time=1941] because he had received an ordination which is recorded in Acts chapter 13 but Paul said I am
[time=1948] an apostle by the will of God God made me an apostle he put me in this place I have his stamp of a
[time=1956] authority upon my life and oh how important that's going to be as these Colossian brethren read this
[time=1963] letter for Paul is going to say some very heavy and some very strong things to them and if they read
[time=1971] that letter as if it came from a human who was just expressing his viewpoint his opinion then they
[time=1978] would not get from the letter the authority which God wanted them to get and so Paul tells them at
[time=1984] the very beginning here are my qualifications I am an apostle because God has made me an apostle
[time=1991] and I am declaring to you the word of God. Now notice that he moves from his own person to describe
[time=2000] a young man who is with him in the writing process he says Paul the apostle by the will of God and
[time=2007] Timothy our brother Timothy was Paul's son in the faith he at one time had had a great ministry
[time=2015] in Ephesus and he was with Paul in the writing of this epistle perhaps they conferred together as
[time=2021] Paul wrote the very words perhaps Paul sat on one side of the desk and Timothy on the other
[time=2027] and they talked back and forth about the problems that had been brought to them and Timothy and Paul together composed the answer that would go back to the Colossian church Paul said Timothy is a
[time=2039] faithful brother he was a brother because he was born into the brotherhood he was not a brother
[time=2045] in the sense that we hear so much about today the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God
[time=2051] brothers are born not made and Timothy was a born brother born into the family of God he was both
[time=2059] Paul's son in the faith and his brother in the ministry now Paul begins having described himself
[time=2067] and the one who writes with him to address the Colossians saints who are the recipients of this
[time=2074] letter now notice that the letter was addressed to the church but it was sent to the saints and I
[time=2081] like the way he describes these people who are in Colossae he says to the saints and the faithful
[time=2088] brethren in Christ now I think it's important that we stop for just a moment and describe
[time=2094] what is a saint for there an awful lot of funny understandings about sainthood the bible says that
[time=2101] you and that I are saints there are some folks who believe today that a saint becomes a saint because
[time=2110] someone declares him to be one and there are certain sections of the larger church which
[time=2117] tell us that a person dies and after he dies he is beadified and then once he has beadified
[time=2125] they take two people who know about him and one of them becomes what they call the
[time=2131] advocates diabally the devil's advocate and the other becomes the defender and the
[time=2138] advocates diabally brings all of the charges against this person and the defender clears the
[time=2144] person of all the charges and then in that process they declare that person to be a saint and then
[time=2150] the defender and the advocates diabally bow down and worship the one that they have just declared
[time=2156] to be a saint now that's not the kind of sainthood that Paul was talking about he's not talking about
[time=2163] a paper saint that we declare to be one through some church tradition or ritual Paul is talking
[time=2169] about the kind of sainthood that comes because Jesus Christ declares us to be saints when he wrote
[time=2177] to the church in Corinth he addressed them as those who were called to be saints you say well that
[time=2183] must have been a great church filled with highly moral and and exemplified character in every
[time=2190] aspect yet I know if you read the book of first Corinthians like I do you discover that this church called to be saints was filled with people who were involved in immorality people who were
[time=2202] going to court with each other people who were divisive and had divisions among them people who came to the Lord's table in a drunken stupor and yet Paul said they were called to be saints
[time=2213] now what does that mean well it's very the very simplest that I can explain it to you it means
[time=2219] this that they were saints because of their position but not necessarily because of their
[time=2226] character or conduct when I was growing up in school in science class once in a while we would
[time=2233] work with what they call a prism and we would hold that prism up to the light and as we would look
[time=2239] through it and move it in a certain way different colors and rays would shine through that prism
[time=2245] and as you look through the prism and through the rays everything on the other side of the prism would take on the certain color that was coming through the prism from the sun that's in essence
[time=2255] what Paul is talking about he is saying to us that when we put our faith in Jesus Christ
[time=2261] God the Father holds up the prism of Jesus Christ and he looks through that prism and he sees the
[time=2268] holiness and righteousness of Jesus Christ and on the other side of that prism are we and he sees us
[time=2275] in the light of the righteousness of Christ and we are called to be saints because of Jesus Christ
[time=2281] and his righteousness and so Paul writing to the Colossians is saying to them I want you to know
[time=2288] that I consider you to be a part of the family you are saints in Christ Jesus but then he uses a
[time=2294] further description and I have no way of telling whether this is a subdivision of the first group
[time=2301] or just another way to describe the first group but if Paul were a pastor I'm sure he would know
[time=2308] the difference between the saints and the faithful brethren because there's a difference
[time=2314] this group this morning I would say is composed largely of those who put their trust in Christ they're the saints they have been declared righteous in Christ Jesus but I do not know that we would say that everyone here belongs to that select group called the faithful brethren the faithful brethren are those who can be counted on usually they meet in the middle of the week to get the job done while the saints collect on Sunday the faithful brethren see that the work goes forward they're
[time=2340] the ones who stand in the trenches and are dependable and get the work done within the church so Paul
[time=2346] addresses these dear people as the saints and the faithful brethren now in the rest of his introductory
[time=2353] comments Paul tells the Colossians what he has heard about them I want you to think for just a
[time=2361] moment that someone comes up to you in the hallway after our service today and says John I heard about
[time=2369] you does that inspire within you a positive or a negative response well if you've been good
[time=2381] you know you don't have anything to hide and you're not looking over your shoulder in any
[time=2387] meaningful way if they say that it doesn't bother you you just say well is that right I'm interested to hear what you have to hear but if you haven't been good and if you know some things that you wouldn't be so happy if somebody else knew and someone came up to you and said I heard about you your heart might skip a beat and if you don't understand what I'm talking about then let me explain it in this way it's the difference between seeing a red light in your mirror when
[time=2412] you're going according to the speed limit and when you're not now you understand what I'm talking
[time=2418] about when you see that red light and you're locked in on cruise control at 50 and the and the light
[time=2425] comes on you see it and it's an observation if you're going 65 and you see it it's not an observation
[time=2431] it's a mild heart attack Paul said to the Colossians I heard about you and I'd like to have been there
[time=2441] when they opened that letter and read those first words and and didn't get beyond the first words
[time=2447] and here is the apostle the great apostle they'd all heard about him and he's writing and he is saying dear Colossians I've heard about you uh oh but Paul had a tremendous message to share with him
[time=2460] he had heard some great things about these people and I'd like for us to notice very quickly what
[time=2466] he had heard first of all he had heard about their faith notice that he says we heard of your faith
[time=2474] in Christ Jesus verse four now I want you to understand that Paul is very careful to define
[time=2481] their faith if I were to come into a group of godly people or supposedly Christian people and I
[time=2489] would say to them I've heard about your great faith that might mean any number of things but Paul
[time=2495] doesn't leave it hanging in the mid-air he said I've heard about your rock bottom faith in Christ Jesus your faith is only as good as the object of your faith there are some folks today that think
[time=2508] faith is some sort of nebulous feeling of expectancy that everything is going to turn out all right that if we cross all of our fingers and all of our toes and make three good wishes before breakfast every morning we'll have a good day but faith is not that faith is in a person it is in the truth
[time=2526] and if the truth isn't underneath your faith then it is a false faith some of you read as I did
[time=2532] yesterday in the sports page about the new football coach at Louisiana State University
[time=2538] Bo Rain he'd been on the job only a few days and he was off on a recruiting trip and someone was
[time=2545] sent down to pick him up in a small session aircraft to bring him back to the campus and according to
[time=2551] the report the assessment aircraft was piloted by an experienced pilot who knew all of the ramifications
[time=2557] of that plane that it had a certain ceiling over which it could not traverse or it would be in deep
[time=2563] trouble but according to the reports on the radar and the tracking instruments that plane began to
[time=2569] climb and it climbed and it climbed and it went on up to 28 000 feet and finally it disappeared off
[time=2575] of the off of the radar instruments and they sent out someone to track it and they found it going off in a weird course way off schedule it ended up a thousand miles off of its course and finally
[time=2587] one of the tracking planes saw it as it plummeted out of the sky and down into the sea and both the
[time=2593] pilot and the coach were lost now I have to make a very firm assumption about that problem and that
[time=2599] is that there was something wrong in the process of faith the articles in the paper said that that
[time=2609] particular craft had been having some trouble with its tracking devices and with its control devices that sometimes they'd been doing crazy things and hadn't been responding accurately and
[time=2619] I have to believe that that pilot and that coach were in that plane and all of their faith was in
[time=2625] those instruments and they believed that they were on target that they were at the proper altitude and that everything was going right but alas the instruments were not telling the truth and their
[time=2635] faith was not in reality and so they put their faith in something that was wrong and their faith
[time=2641] took them to the grave and I just want to say today that Paul is right on target when he
[time=2647] commends the Colossians for their faith in Christ Jesus and if your faith is in anything else for
[time=2654] eternal life men and women you are headed on a journey away from your appointed destination
[time=2662] you are headed on a journey to destruction you better check the source of your faith and make sure that your faith is in Christ Paul said I heard about your faith in Christ Jesus I want you to
[time=2674] turn in your Bibles to Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6 for here we have a very interesting verse
[time=2681] of scripture that relates the first and the second characteristics of these dear Colossian people
[time=2687] Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6 notice what it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[time=2697] availeth anything nor uncircumcision notice this phrase but faith which worketh by love and then I
[time=2706] want you to notice what Paul said in Colossians in his second statement to these dear believers he said I heard about your faith in Christ Jesus but secondly I want you to know that I heard
[time=2719] about your love which you have to all the saints now it's one thing to have faith but it's another
[time=2727] thing to have a working faith and Paul writing to the Galatians says that faith works by love
[time=2733] if you've got faith in Christ Jesus it will be demonstrated in your love to all the saints
[time=2739] and Paul said I heard about you Colossians that you have a deep and abiding love not just for
[time=2746] some of the saints or for selected ones of the saints but for all of the saints all of the Christians
[time=2752] you have a love for them in this past week I have preached to the saints in Tulsa Oklahoma in Indianapolis Indiana in Dayton Ohio and I'm going to be in Florida next week and you know what I'll discover
[time=2763] I'll discover a oneness and a bond of love with all of these people though I've never met them before no matter where they live if they're in Christ Jesus there is a love relationship with all
[time=2774] of them now you say pastor I could buy that if the word all wasn't in that phrase I could have love
[time=2784] for the saints but when you put all in there that's that's all and I can tell you a few of the saints
[time=2790] that I don't love you've heard that old poem that says to love the saints above that'll be glory
[time=2797] but to love the saints I know below that's another story you know we can always love collectively
[time=2805] but we have to love individually and God tells us that it's our job to demonstrate our faith in
[time=2812] Christ Jesus by our love for all the saints that's what it means over in the epistles when it says
[time=2818] by their love you shall know them you can tell a disciple by his love for the brethren and I'm so
[time=2825] glad that in the closing moments of this first paragraph Paul gave us the key to that kind of love
[time=2831] because I don't know about you but I know about me and I am not capable of that I know some of the
[time=2838] oraneous saints you ever met in your life they're not most of them here today I don't I don't think but
[time=2845] I have said in recent days that there are times when Christian people do things that my
[time=2852] unsaved friends would never do and it's not always easy to love them but you know how you do it
[time=2858] look down at the end of verse eight and notice that Paul said I heard about your love in the spirit
[time=2867] that's how it's done it's a spiritual kind of love that's what he meant over in Romans when he said
[time=2873] that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts how by the Holy Spirit whom he has given unto us
[time=2879] and God wants us to love in the spiritual realm and that doesn't mean that we don't love really
[time=2885] but it means it's a supernatural kind of love that enables us to look beyond our differences
[time=2891] and our idiosyncrasies and our prejudices and put our arms around God's people and say I've got faith in Jesus Christ and it's demonstrated in the fact that I love you because you're a part
[time=2902] of God's family if you missed the love feast in this church last Sunday night as a part of our
[time=2908] communion service you missed it that's what love is about it is love that reaches out and accepts
[time=2915] and forgives and wants the love relationship to continue Paul said I heard about your faith in
[time=2921] Christ Jesus I heard about your love and then he goes on to say that he heard about their hope
[time=2928] now this isn't a hope so kind of hope it's a real hope in fact he says in verse five that this
[time=2935] hope is is laid up or it is it means to be buried or or or solidified in heaven Paul said I heard
[time=2944] about your hope which is laid up in heaven here is a group of folks who really have it together
[time=2952] they've got a firm faith in Jesus Christ that's for sure they have a tremendous love for each other
[time=2959] all of the saints are included in that and they've got their eyes fixed on heaven looking for the
[time=2965] soon return of Jesus Christ because they believe that he's coming back any moment and they know that
[time=2971] no matter how good it is in the fellowship of the church at Colossians going to be better up in heaven and that's where their hope is Paul said I heard about your hope I'm sure you notice that
[time=2982] these are the three of the great trilogy that's found over and over in the New Testament faith hope and love and Paul wrote to the Corinthians in the 13th chapter he said there's three qualities
[time=2994] that remain faith hope and charity are love and the greatest of these is love and so this
[time=3001] Colossian church had all of these qualities and I know that maybe I'm a little prejudiced as a pastor
[time=3008] but as I look out over our congregation and as I meditate upon the people God is brought to this
[time=3014] church I can honestly say that I see those qualities in us and in you your faith in Christ Jesus
[time=3021] your love for all the saints and your hope which is settled in heaven looking for the Lord's return
[time=3027] but he had one more thing that he wanted to tell him about that he had heard this is a great challenge to all of us as we face a year ahead of us in this new decade and in the 1980s he said
[time=3039] I heard of your hope verse five and verse six which has come unto you as it is in all the world
[time=3045] and bringeth forth fruit as it does also in you since the day you heard of it and knew the grace
[time=3052] of God in truth he said I heard about your fruit fruit in the Bible means productiveness
[time=3059] there are three kinds of New Testament fruit that Paul is talking about there is the fruit of conduct
[time=3065] what we do how we act our lifestyle there is the fruit of character that's what the fruit of the
[time=3072] spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness meekness temperance etc and then there is the fruit of converts the fruit that we have when we reproduce ourselves
[time=3084] and other people and we win them to Christ and they are our spiritual children Timothy was the fruit
[time=3091] of Paul he was Paul's spiritual child epipheress was one that Paul had discipled he was some fruit
[time=3099] that Paul had brought forth and Paul writing to the Colossians said I heard that you're a fruitful
[time=3105] church oh how I want this church to be a fruitful church a church that reproduces itself in character
[time=3112] in conduct and in converts and that will be a part of the great testimony that this church should have
[time=3118] and ought to have and by God's grace will have in the future Paul said I heard about you and then
[time=3126] as he closes this introductory section he reminds them of their pastor and he says I want to let you
[time=3135] know how much I think of your pastor this man epipheress he's a great man he describes him in
[time=3142] verses seven and eight in the following way he says he is a dear fellow servant and a faithful
[time=3148] minister of Christ a dear fellow servant and a faithful minister of Christ I couldn't help but
[time=3157] find in this passage of scripture in this book over in the fourth chapter of Colossians in verse 12 these additional words about the pastor of the church in Colossae what a high and holy example
[time=3170] he holds up for all who aspire to leadership and for all who would be involved in reproducing themselves in the lives of other people he says of this epipheress in chapter four and verse 12
[time=3181] epipheress is one of you and we've already explored that he was a Colossian he is one of
[time=3188] you a servant of Christ he greets you now notice this description of of him he is always laboring
[time=3197] fervently for you in prayers that you might stand perfect and complete in all the will of God
[time=3205] that's the kind of pastry was I've often thought as I've read about men like this that one of the
[time=3211] problems we have in our churches that we try to do too much of the work that needs to be done on our knees up on our feet we're always rushing about trying to get the job done trying to make
[time=3222] sure we touch all the bases here was a pastor who understood that a lot of the work gets done on the knees and he prayed fervently for his people and he didn't just pray that they would be well
[time=3233] that they would get out of the hospital and I know those things are all important I know the terrible burden that sickness is and problems are and how we ought to pray for one another but when was the last time you heard anybody pray the kind of prayer that epipheress prayed he prayed that they might
[time=3250] be mature and complete in all the will of God that was what he labored fervently on his knees about
[time=3260] and that was the thing that consumed him as a pastor and all if I can just touch the hem of the garment of that truth for all of you dear people who are in the process of growth and maturity
[time=3271] and begin to understand that the job we have in leadership is to come before God and to pray
[time=3277] and to labor fervently that you might be complete and stable and mature not just in part of the
[time=3283] will of God but in all the will of God then we'll see the kind of stability and steadfastness and
[time=3291] always abounding in the work of the Lord that needs to happen in our church and we'll be reproducing
[time=3297] ourselves and we'll have a testimony like the church at Colossi had let me ask you a question this morning are you a mature Christian are you growing in the Lord are you maturing and stabilizing
[time=3310] and becoming of the stature that you ought to be for your age as a believer Paul said that epipheress prayed and labored for such a high and holy goal so then this letter
[time=3328] was written by the Apostle Paul with Timothy his brother to the Colossians who were saints
[time=3337] and delivered by their pastor epipheress who was a dear servant of the Lord
[time=3343] and it exemplifies the importance of godliness and righteousness within the body
[time=3350] as it speaks of faith and hope and love and fruit and may God help us each one to have that at the
[time=3358] top of our priority list as we watch our church mature and grow and go into the 80s shall we pray
[time=3367] our father as we conclude this hour together we are reminded of the tremendously high standard
[time=3378] that is set for us in God's holy word we realize that we have not even come close to measuring up
[time=3385] as we ought and yet we're so grateful that these benchmarks are there for that for we realize that
[time=3391] that's what we're to be shooting for that's what we're to be asking for seeking for we are reminded today that that God in heaven may not be impressed with those things which
[time=3403] seem so easily to impress us but that he's impressed with our growth and our maturity and our development
