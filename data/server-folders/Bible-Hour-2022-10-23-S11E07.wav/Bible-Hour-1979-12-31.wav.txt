[time=17] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerramon.
[time=55] [MUSIC]
[time=70] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=73] >> Throughout the United States and around the world,
[time=79] there is a tremendous dearth of leadership among Christianity.
[time=84] Our seminaries are crying out that they're not getting enough young men who want to go into the ministry.
[time=89] Our churches are saying that they can't find pastors.
[time=92] Our schools are crying that they can't find professors and teachers to train those to go into full-time service.
[time=99] It is not a young problem but an age-old one, the problem of Christian leadership.
[time=105] It's interesting to me as I open the pages of the Old Testament to see how God in a wonderful way prepared his leaders.
[time=113] On today's television program, we're going to be sharing together a message from the Old Testament on the preparation of Moses for leadership in the plan of God.
[time=123] I think you'll find some of the truths we study together full of great insight into the text of the Old Testament scriptures and a great encouragement and help to you in your own personal life.
[time=134] And I trust you'll stay with us as we turn in a few moments to the Word of God.
[time=139] On today's telecast, we have the privilege of sharing in the ministry of the Liberty Baptist College Singers all the way from Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=147] They're sharing with us in this service all of the special music.
[time=151] They come from the school that is led by Pastor Jerry Falwell, whom I'm sure is not a stranger to many of you.
[time=158] And we're so delighted to have them with us today throughout the services of this particular morning service, which is telecasted out into many areas in here in the Midwest.
[time=168] We want you to enjoy now the ministry of the LBC Singers from Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=198] [MUSIC - 89 seconds]
[time=295] And then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds, shall we ever be with the Lord?
[time=302] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=361] â™ª Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today, and I know you've appreciated the Liberty Baptist College Singers.
[time=373] We're going to be hearing a lot more from them in just a few moments, and I hope you'll stay with us through the whole hour as we share together this exciting music from a ministry that we all are very much believing in and thanking God for these days.
[time=386] Donna, this is a special time of the year for getting out literature.
[time=391] It's a time of the year when people are beginning new programs of Bible study.
[time=395] Some have already started, hopefully they haven't stopped yet, and it's a great time to get started in a new program of Bible study.
[time=404] And that's why I'm so excited that we can extend to people an opportunity to study one of the greatest sections in all of the Bible, the section that records the life of our Lord.
[time=415] That Bible study tool is what we're making available to our friends during this time.
[time=420] It's a booklet on the Four Gospels, and it arranges in order the events in our Lord's life.
[time=427] And I think that's an especially exciting topic of study
[time=433] when you're going through the Scriptures, if you're looking for something to study in this new year, to study the life of Christ.
[time=439] And this would be a real helpful tool if you were to do that.
[time=443] I'm excited about it because it takes each of the events and teachings of Christ
[time=449] and puts it together so that you can begin at His birth and read through His life all the way through to the resurrection and the post-resurrection appearances.
[time=459] And when you get done, you have a grasp of the Lord's life that you would not get even by reading the Gospels.
[time=466] Of course, the material in this book is nothing more or less than the King James Version of the Scripture with the paragraphs of Scripture arranged chronologically.
[time=474] It contains an index, that's very helpful, for you can take any event in the life of the Lord, and if you can remember even one of the key words, look it up, and it tells you what page it's located on.
[time=484] Donna, how do our people, who are sharing the telecast with us today, receive this free gift and use it in these next days as they study the Word of God?
[time=493] The most convenient way for you to get in touch with this is by using our toll-free number.
[time=498] That number is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=504] You dial that number any time of the day or night, any time during the week, and just ask for the Bible Hour operator.
[time=510] Tell her that you would like the booklet offered on the Bible Hour today, the four Gospels, and we will be happy to mail it to you free and postage paid.
[time=518] That number again to call is 1-800-247-2160.
[time=525] Donna, I want to encourage our people to be patient if they don't get through, because we're only on one hour in your area, wherever you see the Bible Hour.
[time=533] Obviously, the intensity of calls comes at that particular time, so if you don't get through to the 800 number, remember to be patient and just wait for a little bit and call again.
[time=543] Then of course, if you decide that you can't get through or maybe you don't want to call again,
[time=549] that's a good opportunity for you to use the mail.
[time=551] I think maybe if the phone's busy and you can't get through, God wants you to write to us, so sit down and write us a letter.
[time=557] We especially appreciate the letters because we get a chance to particularly and personally invest our time in reading what God is doing in your life.
[time=565] If you have a prayer request, we'd like to hear about it.
[time=569] And if you have some special response to the Bible Hour Ministry, it would be also helpful for you to write us and let us know.
[time=576] During these days, as we begin the new year, it is very important that we hear from many of you from the outlying areas where the television program is seen.
[time=585] Here in Fort Wayne, the program is self-supporting, and that's due, of course, to the fact that many of our own people are behind the program financially.
[time=593] The majority of the support for the Bible Hour comes in this area from our own people here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=600] But as we face the new year, and as we face the rising costs of television, it's extremely important that every station stand on its own two feet and be self-supporting.
[time=610] That's not true in every market, though it is in some.
[time=613] I'd like to ask you to take a special interest in the Bible Hour as it extends to your home and to your heart.
[time=619] By sitting down and writing a letter and closing a contribution for the support of this ministry as God enables you to do so, most of all letting us know that you're praying for the Bible Hour in your area and that you support it with your prayer, with your personal response, and as much as possible with your financial assistance.
[time=638] We thank God for the privilege of ministering His Word in your life, and we pray that as we look forward to the future, we will see a growing and expanding ministry of the teaching of the Word of God through the Bible Hour.
[time=650] Once again, before we go back to our service, here's some more music from the LBC Corral.
[time=656] Let's talk for just a moment about how they close the cycle on the communication process and get back to us, Donna.
[time=663] You may call us at 1-800-247-2160 at any time,
[time=669] or if you prefer, you may write to us your right to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15-250-Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=680] The zip code is 46815.
[time=684] Thank you for being a part of this telecast, and please stay with us through this hour as we turn our attention in a few moments to the Word of God, talking about the goals that God puts in our hearts as we strive to be like Him.
[time=696] And I trust that you'll have the opportunity to open your Bible in your home and share with us as we teach God's Word.
[time=709] Now rest by long, divine, and hard, big, solid, brave, sacred.
[time=718] For ever from where we are, within all that everybody will say, that we have been, when Jesus wants my sin to live, when we tell me how God can pray, and we return us to every day, our day, our day, when Jesus wants my sin to live.
[time=754] Well, I know you've enjoyed the ministry of the LBC Singers as we have.
[time=762] They've been a great blessing to us, and I trust that you will open your hearts now as they come back to minister to us again.
[time=769] They're going to sing a great song about the Church, the Church and its ministry and its vitality, and its success during these days.
[time=777] I know that it will be a great blessing to you as you share together the LBC Singers and the Church triumphant.
[time=792] Let the Church, me and Church, let the people rejoice for we sell all the questions.
[time=809] We make our choice, let the earth alms ring out, songs of victory swell, for the Church, I am there, He's alive and well.
[time=843] This soul she has been through battles before,
[time=852] storms and steadfast, and rocks on the shore of earth, though the home may be battered, that it's high, it's safe and dry, it will carry its cargo to a mansion, alive and high.
[time=883] God has always had a people.
[time=886] Many a foolish conqueror has made the mistake of thinking, and because he had forced the Church of Jesus Christ out of sight, that he'd steal its voice and snuffed out its life.
[time=895] But God has always had a people, the powerful current of a rushing river, is not diminished because it's forced to flow into ground.
[time=903] Why they tell me that the purest water is the stream that bursts crystal clear into the sunlight after having fought its way through solid rock.
[time=911] There have been charlatans, like Simon the Magician, who sought to barter on the open market, that power that cannot be bought or sold.
[time=919] But God has always had a people, men who could not be bought, and women who were beyond purchase.
[time=928] Yes, God has always had a people.
[time=931] There have been times of affluence and prosperity when the Church's message was nearly diluted into oblivion by those who sought to make it socially attractive, neatly organized and financially profitable.
[time=943] It has been gold-plated, draped in purple, and in crystal with jewels.
[time=949] The Church has been misrepresented, ridiculed, slaughtered, and stored.
[time=953] These followers of Jesus Christ have been according to the whim of the times, elevated as sacred leaders, and martyred as heretics.
[time=962] He had threw it all.
[time=964] Their march is on that powerful army of the me.
[time=967] God's chosen people who cannot be bought, flattered, murdered, or still, on through the ages they march.
[time=975] The Church, God's Church triumphant, alive and well.
[time=984] Let the Church be the Church, let the people rejoice, for we sell the Christ child, we mail our choice, let the anthem train down, songs of victory swell, for the Church triumphant.
[time=1017] It's alive.
[time=1027] Listen, trial of God.
[time=1029] It's alive, discourage pastor.
[time=1031] This is God's Church, and it's still alive, only missionary, soul to seek with confidence.
[time=1037] It's alive, my broken hearted friend, old saint.
[time=1040] You're not alone in forgotten.
[time=1041] The Church is still alive.
[time=1043] Busy mothers cast all your cares on Jesus.
[time=1046] It's alive, young students.
[time=1048] You're not alone in serving the Lord.
[time=1050] Faithful fathers, there's rest in the Lord, cynical skeptic.
[time=1054] You haven't killed God with your noisy unbelief.
[time=1057] He's alive.
[time=1058] So family of God, lift your voices and plate the Lord.
[time=1062] God's Church is still alive and doing well.
[time=1071] [AMEN - 19 seconds]
[time=1095] Thank you, singers, for your ministry to us.
[time=1097] We appreciate so much.
[time=1099] Not only in the music, but the message in the music.
[time=1103] I want you to open your Bibles to two passages of Scripture.
[time=1108] One in the Old Testament, and one in the New.
[time=1111] First of all, to the second chapter of the Book of Exodus, and hold your place there with a piece of paper or with a finger, and then to the 11th chapter of the Book of Hebrews.
[time=1123] Exodus chapter 2 and Hebrews chapter 11, and we will look at one additional passages of Scripture in the message that is before us.
[time=1132] If you found the passage in Exodus, and now you have your Bibles open to Hebrews chapter 11, let me read for you the text which summarizes the life of the man we will study in our message.
[time=1147] We read in Hebrews chapter 11, beginning at verse 2023, these words.
[time=1154] By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
[time=1166] By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=1178] A steaming the reproach of Christ, greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, had respect unto the recompense of the reward.
[time=1186] By faith, he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.
[time=1193] Through faith, he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
[time=1200] By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned.
[time=1209] Shall we pray together?
[time=1211] Our Father, we ask that you will help us as we look in on the life of this great man to glean from his life in these early days of the preparation of this man of God, the truths that would apply to our lives, wherever we may be in serving thee as lay people, as staff members, as individuals who desire that our lives count the most for God.
[time=1237] We pray our Father that we shall see through the historical analysis of this part of the life of Moses and discern the lessons that are important for us to understand.
[time=1249] Bless our time and thy word.
[time=1251] Lord, open our hearts to receive it.
[time=1253] We pray that you will draw a curtain on our minds that we will think of nothing else in these moments together, but the importance and intensity of the word of God as it speaks to our hearts.
[time=1264] We have come tonight as hungry people.
[time=1266] We want to hear from heaven.
[time=1268] We confess that we need a message from the Lord by the Spirit of God, apply the truth of thy word to our hearts, that we might, having been together in this service, be able to say that it's been good to be in the house of God and we're grateful for what the Lord has taught us through his word by his servant.
[time=1288] We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1291] The Scripture is clear that the man Moses was the greatest man
[time=1297] who ever lived before Christ.
[time=1300] In fact, the word of God says that no prophet arose like unto Moses after him in Israel.
[time=1307] So great was this man of God that the Scripture says that Jesus Christ was a prophet like unto Moses.
[time=1315] As the dawn of the New Testament days opened up, the people were looking forward to having a prophet to whom they could appeal a prophet like unto the man Moses who was revered by all of the Jewish people.
[time=1331] No one gainsays the greatness of the man Moses.
[time=1334] He was indeed a great man.
[time=1337] Contrary to the opinion of many, great men are not born.
[time=1342] No one is born a great man.
[time=1345] Moses was a great man because God made him that way through the early experiences of his life, through his education, through the consecration of his life to do the will of God.
[time=1357] It is important that we look at his life and discern what it was that God used to make him the man that he was, the great leader that he was, the law giver, the prophet, yes even the priest of the people of Israel.
[time=1375] We have been studying the early days of his life and the intrigue of his beginning, the mystery and majesty and the beauty of the narrative of his early days, the protection of God upon his life in the bull rushes, the wonderful way that the sovereignty of God is displayed in his early life as God took the one who would have destroyed him and rather used him to foster him in his own home.
[time=1403] He became a foster child of Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=1408] In the second chapter of the book of Exodus, we have come through the first few verses up to verse 10 and we come to the tenth verse and read the following report on the early life of Moses.
[time=1421] We read that the child grew and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son and she called his name Moses and she said because I drew him out of the water.
[time=1437] When Moses' mother had reared Moses to the age of approximately 12, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and turned him over to this woman and the scripture says he became the foster son of Pharaoh's daughter and he moved into the palace in Egypt to be reared as the child of the king's house.
[time=1458] Now between the tenth verse of Exodus chapter 2 and the eleventh verse of Exodus chapter 2, there's a great deal of material that is not recorded here in the second chapter.
[time=1470] And we have to go to the New Testament to find out what God would have us know about these intervening years in the life of Moses, the years that he spent in Pharaoh's court as he was being trained by the enemy to be God's deliverer from the enemy. And I would like for us to consider in this aspect of his life two important things that molded and shaped him and made him what he was in the future. First of all the education that he received and secondly his consecration to God which made him a man God could use. And before we look at these two lessons let me say that the one without the other is an impossible situation.
[time=1514] A man who is consecrated but who has not been prepared is like a dull edged sword. We have about us in the country today many of the cults that are associated with evangelical Christianity who look down upon education and who say you don't need to do anything but pick up your Bible and begin to preach and certainly God has used many men like that. You can look over the historical analysis of Christianity and you can find here and then great men whom God used without preparing them.
[time=1546] But one could but wonder what would have happened had God properly prepared those men and used them to the fullest of their extent. There is no premium on ignorance in serving God. A man who has the opportunity to prepare to serve God ought to give his preparation everything that he has. But alas there is another problem that perhaps is greater than the first. A man who has been educated but who is not consecrated is a man without any sword at all. All over our country today are men and women who are trying to serve God based on the preparation in some Bible school or seminary who have all of the facts but have never given themselves and the use of those facts over to the Lord in complete dedication.
[time=1590] There are men who are graduates of seminaries with masters degrees and doctors degrees who know the Bible from the front end to the back end who know all of the historical facts of the Scripture but because they have not given themselves in consecration to the Lord the facts are simply items that are stored in their mind for dissemination as you would pass out food in a lunch line.
[time=1614] The two of these lessons, the two of these major impacts upon the life of Moses are critical. We cannot accept one without the other and we need to see them as they work together to prepare a man whom God would use significantly like he never used any other man in history. It is a strange thing that the education of Moses during these years depends upon an obscure passage found in the seventh chapter of the book of Acts but because it is obscure and isolated it is not in any way to be taken lightly. We find in Acts chapter 7 verses 22 and 23 these words concerning the man Moses.
[time=1654] These words are found in the address of Stephen to the Sanhedrin.
[time=1662] It is an historical reference by which Stephen mentions certain information that is not recorded any place in the Old Testament. And this information is accurate information because it comes to us from the inspired word of God. Listen to what Stephen says concerning the man Moses in Acts chapter 7 verses 22 and 23. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and he was mighty in words and in deeds. And when he was full 40 years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. Now between Exodus chapter 2 verse 10 and Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 comes Acts chapter 7 verses 22 and 23 where we learn three important facts about the man Moses. First of all we learned that while he was in Pharaoh's court he was trained first of all he was trained as a student. The Scripture says he was learned. The Scripture says he was learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians. The Egyptian culture of that day was the epitome of learning. They were at the zenith of science and architecture. They had all of the facts that were available.
[time=1742] Archaeologists today study the Egyptian period into which Moses was born and they tell us that that particular culture was far ahead of all of the cultures in that area. They were the central drawing place for all the nations around and Moses was placed strategically in the culture of Egypt so that he could be trained and prepared so that he could learn the wisdom of the Egyptians. Secondly this passage tells us that Moses was trained not only as a student but he was trained as a statesman. The Scripture says that while he was there while he was studying in Pharaoh's court he became a man who was mighty in words. He became an eloquent speaker a man who could sway people with his oratory with his words.
[time=1790] He became a statesman, one who could speak with authority certainly in the training that he received while he was studying there. He became endowed with unique oratorical powers. But the Scripture goes on to say that while he was studying in Pharaoh's court he became a soldier. For the reference in verse 22 to his mighty deeds is no doubt a reference to his military expertise. Here we must depend upon secular references and tradition to help us understand what Moses did while he was in the Egyptian court.
[time=1826] Tradition records great victories that he wrought as a military leader leading the soldiers of the Egyptian culture out against the foes of that land. The armies that he led gained great victories under his leadership. During that time he was learning all of the military prowess and discipline and patience and the ability to make decisions his curriculum in the military school of Egypt would have included all of those lessons that he would have to learn to be the leader of the two and a half million Israelites that he would one day lead throughout the wilderness. He would learn all of the communication techniques and he would learn something of what it meant to delegate authority out among the people and how to control great crowds of people. All of these things he learned at the expense of the enemy while he was serving in Egyptians court.
[time=1878] During the time he was studying there he would have had classmates from many of the surrounding nations. The countries of the Jason nations to Egypt would have sent their people to Egypt for their education and Moses would have learned about the cultures that surrounded that nation. He would have traveled as an emissary of the Egyptian government to many parts of the country and learned something of the geography of the land that surrounded Egypt. Tradition says that when the Ethiopians evaded the land of Egypt that Moses was at the head of the army and he routed the enemy and because of his great victory he became respected, loved and revered by all of the Egyptian people. It is good for us to pause for just a moment and remember that this educational process that was taking place in the life of the man Moses as he became a statesman as he became a student of the Egyptian wisdom and as he became a soldier all of this was provided for sovereignly by God at the expense of the country that one day he would fight against.
[time=1946] His education was not a second class education. The honorable DJ Brewer, an associate judge of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in a speech that he gave some years ago made reference to Moses as a law giver. Here is a contemporary judicial opinion of the man Moses.
[time=1974] He wrote, "He who on Sinai's summit received the decalogue from the hand of Jehovah was gifted with a power enabling him to fashion a body of law which has been the code of a race in some respects the most unique in human history. A code which is also a mighty force in the wondrous civilization of today. Moses does not fall short when he is placed beside the great law givers of this race. Now we understand that the law came from God but Moses wrote it down and fashioned it so that it was understandable by the people and even a contemporary scholar says that Moses was a brilliant man in his day.
[time=2018] How is it that his tools were sharpened and that he was prepared in this process to go out and lead a mighty people for God? God saw to it that he got the proper preparation.
[time=2030] His education was important. Let me speak for just a moment to the young people who might be here today or who might be hearing my voice. There is no premium on ignorance.
[time=2042] It does not mean that if you are not educated God cannot use you but it does mean that God wants us to do the very best we can to get prepared at the very best places with the very best opportunities so that we can go out and serve God and be a sharp tool in his hands. And if God has called you to serve him, certainly one of the decisions you need to be making early in your experience as a called servant of God is how you will get prepared to serve the Lord. And I hope that you will understand as you go off to school or as some of you now are in school preparing for the ministry that that part of your life is just as important as the part of your life when you will be out at the front of the battle serving God in the heat of combat. Had Moses not had the opportunity that he had in Egypt, he would never have been able to do what God needed him to do when he led the people of Israel during the next 80 years of his life.
[time=2098] God was preparing him through the process of education.
[time=2102] But you know it's one thing to be educated it's quite another thing to be consecrated.
[time=2110] Sad to say many of the men I went to school with came out of seminary with a great education and they're now working in factories, working in places where theological education really doesn't help you a whole lot. Somehow they miss something between the education and the consecration between the preparation and induction into service.
[time=2138] Men who are recommending pastors these days to the churches are telling us that there's a great dearth of men who are willing to pay the price to go in and be a part of a growing work that they're very concerned about all of the benefits and the salary and all of the things that go along with being comfortable in today's world. They've forgotten that education does not automatically qualify you for a soft life but education is simply the mental preparation, the heart preparation and the rest of it comes when we give ourselves over to God in consecration.
[time=2174] This is what happened according to this text. In Acts chapter 7 and verse 23 the scripture says when Moses became 40 years of age it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. Now the next chapter between Exodus chapter 2 verses 10 and Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 comes to us from the 11th chapter of the book of Hebrews from which we read at the outset of this message. The book of Hebrews chapter 11 will you turn there please. Here in this record of the life of Moses we have the great accomplishments of his life introduced by the phrase by faith. Moses life can be divided into three separate periods of equal number of years. First of all he served 40 years in Pharaoh's court. Secondly he served 40 years in the desert place near Midian near his father-in-law Jethro and thirdly he spent 40 years in the wilderness with the children of Israel.
[time=2234] Verse 23 of Hebrews chapter 11 is introduced by the words by faith. This tells us when Moses first 40 year period began. By faith Moses when he was born was hidden three months. The second 40 year period begins in verse 24. By faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. The scripture says in Acts chapter 7 verse 23 that it was at the age of 40 that he made that decision. And the third period of his life is recorded in verse 29. By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned and immediately after that issued the 40 year period of time in the wilderness. Now here in the 11th chapter we have the record of a very important decision that Moses made. In an earlier message by way of introduction we hit some of the highlights of this crisis in his life and now in this message we want to take just a moment to set down the principles of this consecration in the life of Moses. The scripture records it this way by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2314] And in these next few verses there are four or five principles that we must get a hold of in terms of the consecration of this man it was the education in Egypt and now this commitment in the heart of Moses that made him the man of God that was used so wonderfully in the Old Testament life.
[time=2334] So wonderfully was Moses life used that his life is recorded beginning in the book of Exodus all the way over through the end of the book of Deuteronomy. His life fills four of the five books of the Pentateuch because he so filled the pages of history that it took all of that scripture to record his mighty deeds but it all comes back to this decision that he made when he was 40 years old.
[time=2358] The scripture says that he gave himself to the Lord.
[time=2362] Now I want you to notice the various aspects of his decision first of all I want you to notice the refusal of his consecration we read of this in verse 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. There came a time in Moses life when he made a decision and he turned his back upon the culture of Egypt which was open to him. Now in order for us to understand the magnitude of this decision we once again must look into secular history history records some very interesting things about Moses and since it is not the inspired scripture we cannot vouch for all of its truth but there is enough evidence to believe that this is true that it is worth our inserting it here.
[time=2410] Secular history records that while Moses was in his 20s his foster grandfather the pharaoh of Egypt died. Since his daughter who was acting as Moses mother could not rule Moses was given the opportunity to rule in her stead and history records that he refused. Perhaps it was because he recognized that he was living in the fourth generation and he remembered the promise of God that in the fourth generation God would deliver his people and he was willing to wait for the deliverance of his people rather than to take that opportunity. Pharaoh's daughter Moses foster mother married a half brother of hers and he became the king of Egypt and he ruled for five years at the end of that five year period according to history he died and once again Moses had to make another choice. Once again the kingdom was offered to him if he would take it and rule and once again he refused. Pharaoh's daughter married again this time she married a man who according to history was a very jealous man a king who wanted no rivals to his kingdom Pharaoh's daughter died while married to that man and now her husband was at the throne when Pharaoh's daughter Moses foster mother was no longer there to protect him he became the object of the ruling king's vengeance and wrath he determined to destroy him or to catch him in some sin some sin against the kingdom that would be worthy of punishment according to the history book he was watched by friends of the king they sent men to watch him in his every action and to report back to the king whatever he did wrong that might be one of the explanations for the fast information that was brought to the kingdom when Moses killed two Egyptians which we're going to read about in just a few days the scripture says that when that event took place that the word got to the king immediately and Moses had to flee for his life over and over again from the age of 20 until now he is at the age of 40 Moses was faced with the opportunity to take what was before him in all of the regality and majesty of the Egyptian kingdom and the scripture says that now at the age of 40 he came to the place where he said once and for all no I will not become a part of the Egyptian kingdom and he turned his back upon it up here long enough to say that in this matter of our own personal consecration it always is involved in refusal you cannot say yes to something without saying no to something else when I was in school when I was studying at Cedarville College I determined by my own mind and by my own will that I would become a radio disc jockey I went to work at an FM station in Springfield and worked 40 hours a week while I was there I know that's a humorous thought to some of you but I used to play records from 3 until 11 every night I thought that would be an exciting career and I was determined that's what God was going to do with my life I was running away from the ministry as fast as I could go I said in my life if there's one thing I'd never do it would be to be a preacher I didn't want any part of it everything that God was doing in my life was causing conflict and discomfort and yet I was determined that this was the direction I was going until one day through a series of circumstances God got a hold of me and you know it was necessary when he called me to preach to say no to the desires I had for a career that I had set out in front of me it was necessary for me to refuse what I had chosen so that I could say yes to God it comes to my heart and mind tonight that there are many young people who would like to say yes to God if they didn't have to say no to their own designs and to their own worlds pleasures if they could have both worlds they would be happy yes they'd like the joy of serving God but they don't want to have to refuse anything to accept that privilege may I say to you that becoming a consecrated Christian involves refusal in the New Testament book of Luke in the 14th chapter in the great passage on discipleship the Lord Jesus three times said to those who would follow him you cannot be my disciple you cannot be my disciple you cannot be my disciple unless you're willing to turn your back upon all of those things that mean something to you if you're not willing to put me first and make me preeminent in your life then you cannot be my disciple had Moses wanted Egypt and the Lord's blessing he never would have been a man God could have used the refusal of his consecration let me hasten on to point out the reason of his consecration the scripture says he chose to suffer rather than to enjoy sometimes when we read about Moses we feel that he was pushed into the life of suffering but the scripture says at the very outset of his career as Israel's leader he determined by the grace of God that he would rather suffer with God's people than to have all of the blessings that could be his in the Egyptian culture it was a decision made on the basis of reasoning he chose to do it he would have rather had hardship with God's people than comfort in the world he determined that he would rather have shame and reproach with God than to have fame and honor with the people of the world he was committed to the fact that he would rather have the afflictions that go along with being a child of God in a wicked and perverse generation and to have all of the pleasures that it could have been his as a part of the royal kingdom yes Moses chose the wilderness to the palaces and he did it knowing what he was doing this was not the misgivings of a young neophyte Christian men and women this was the solid reasoning of a 40 year old man who sat down and counted the cost and he said knowing what he was doing I'd rather have it God's way than to have all that the world has to offer me the reasoning of his consecration let me hasten on to point out the reproach of his consecration the scripture says that he would rather have had the reproach of Christ choosing and esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt Moses recognized that if he took it this way he would be identified with the slaves in the land where he lived the Israelites were making bricks out of straw for Pharaoh Moses had a part in the management he could have been in control but he threw all that aside in ceremonial way put upon himself the clothing of a slave and he identified himself with his people rather than to have the Kingly throne that could have been his in that respect he is a type of the Lord Jesus who became obedient unto death humbled himself and was identified with humanity he would rather have had the reproaches that were his with Christ well you notice fourthly the riches of his consecration the scripture says he understood that by such a decision he was gaining greater value than all of the treasures in Egypt he said even though I understand this is going to be a hard life there is a kind of wealth in this decision that no one else can understand the riches of his consecration you know I don't think there are any people that I'd rather be with than people who have given themselves completely to serve God full-time servants of the Lord when we gather in conferences and seminars and we talk about what God is doing there's a kind of joy and wealth and excitement about that you can't measure there's something about being where you know God has you in the center of his will in the place where he has called you to serve there is a wealth and a richness to that that the world will never understand and can never comprehend Moses said yes I know I could have a soft and easy life in the palace but I'd rather serve God because there's a wealth there there's a joy there there's a richness to serving God that cannot be comprehended by the things of the world then will you know that there was a rule to his consecration on the basis of a single rule he made his decision you know what that rule was it was the rule of faith the scripture says by faith by faith someone has said that Moses must have had a direct revelation from God God must have spoke to him calling him to this ministry because the Bible tells us that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God Moses one day got a word from the Lord concerning his future and the scripture says by faith he believed God's word and he entered into this relationship of consecration with the Lord how is it that men and women and young people make decisions to walk with the Lord out into an unknown future some of the people that I know in this congregation right now are struggling with decisions about what God would have you do with your life you can set before you some of the goals of a materialistic and secular world and you can lay it all out and map it out and be pretty sure what's going to happen tomorrow and the next day and the day after that but God is doing a work in your heart and he's calling you to serve him and the hard thing about that is you don't know about tomorrow you don't know what's going to happen next week and next month is like in a different world because God hasn't revealed his plan to you that far ahead how do you make a decision about that well men and women you make that decision on one basic principle and that's the principle of faith you believe that God has called you and even though you don't understand what he wants you to do you take the step of faith and you say Lord whatever it is I'm willing to do it by faith how could Moses turn down all of the blessings and privileges and wealth that could have been his in Egypt he certainly didn't do it by rational process he did it by faith because he believed what God told him will you notice lastly the reward of his consecration the scripture says that he saw something beyond this life he saw something beyond this decision saw something beyond his leadership the scripture says that he saw something in the future and he was willing to wait for the recompense of the reward Moses recognized that there was something out there in the future that was worth waiting for and he made a wise decision when he was willing to give up this world for the next I could not help as I was studying this passage but think of a very wonderful companion passage in the second book of Corinthians it's in the fourth chapter and I would like by way of conclusion for us to look at that tonight second Corinthians chapter 4 second Corinthians chapter 4 verses 16 through 18 here's what we read in this passage of scripture for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal will you notice in these three verses that there is a continual contrast between this life and the next between the things that matter and the things that don't matter if you'll take your pencil and go down through these verses you will see that there is a contrast between the outward part of man which is perishable and the inward part of man which never dies there is a contrast between the light affliction of our suffering during this generation of living as opposed to the eternal weight of glory which is ours when we get to be with the Lord there is a contrast here but with that which is but for a moment and that which is for eternity there is a contrast in these verses between that which is seen in the reality that we observe around us and the unseen things which only the eyes of our faith can focus upon there is a contrast here between the temporal and the eternal and men and women a decision of consecration always has to come to grips with those kinds of realities if I did not believe that God was on the throne and that he had a plan for my life and that he wanted to use me in that plan I would grab everything I could get a hold of of this materialistic world I would take everything my hands could bring to myself I would get all of the pleasure that the world has to offer and I would feel good about getting it if I were not a Christian tonight I would be the most hedonistic person alive for men and women if this world is all there is you better get it while you can get it because there's nothing else afterward oh but let me tell you something that's not the truth there's something beyond this world there's something that's worth all of the sacrifices that serving the Lord might mean to you and that's the eternal weight of glory that awaits you there's something beyond all of the problems and difficulties which you might face in serving God today and that's the reward that comes when you stand before him and you look into his face and he can say to you well done now good and faithful servant enter into the joy of thy Lord if all there is is this life those of us who are Christians those of us who are serving God are foolish crazy out of our minds I want to tell you something there's a day of reckoning coming when those who have given themselves to the Lord and have sold out everything they have to serve him are going to stand before an almighty God and out in the abyss and darkness of the night are those who have lived for pleasure and lived for satisfaction and lived for materialistic gains out into the outer darkness of night forever without God while we spend eternity in fellowship with him reigning and ruling is a part of his great kingdom Moses was a man of God that was used in a mighty way because God prepared him with a great education but he was a man of God because God brought him to a place in his life when he was willing to say no to the world so that he could say yes to God poet has written give me a man of God one man whose faith is master of his mind and I will write all wrongs and bless the name of all mankind give me a man of God one man whose tongue is touched with heavens fire and I will flame the darkest hearts with high resolve and clean desire give me a man of God one man one mighty prophet of the Lord and I will give you peace on earth bought with a prayer and not a sword give me a man of God one man true to the vision that he sees and I will build your broken shrines and bring the nations to their knees Moses was that one man of God a man with a brilliant mind prepared sovereignly by an almighty God but a man who brought it all and put it on the altar and said Lord here it is all of me that there is to have you have I give you everything so that I might serve you shall we pray you've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah
