[time=0] >> From the Congregation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=21] present the Viable Hour with Pastor David Jaramah.
[time=41] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=48] >> Here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, this is New Year's Sunday.
[time=53] This is the last day of the old year, the last time we shall meet together as a congregation
[time=59] in 1978 on a Sunday morning.
[time=62] And we look at this as a very important day, as we look back over the past and consider what God has done for us in these last 365 days and we take a look by faith into the future
[time=74] to consider what He might do for us as we trust Him and walk with Him.
[time=79] And in the moments that we spend in the Word today, I have a prayer for the New Year from
[time=85] the Old Testament, prayer from the lips of Moses that I believe God will apply to our hearts
[time=91] at this crossroads in our lives as we leave 1978 and begin to walk into 1979.
[time=99] Now these past days have been filled with much excitement and enthusiasm for the things
[time=105] of the Christmas season and the music of this time of the year, and we are so grateful
[time=111] to our choir and to Pastor Kruger for their excellent ministry to us during these past days
[time=117] as we have shared together the ministry of the living Christmas tree.
[time=123] One of the great songs that is often sung at Christmas time is a song that speaks of God's
[time=129] love for us, but it is not a Christmas song, it is a song for every day, for it is a song
[time=135] which reminds us that God sent His Son into this world to exhibit His love, and so loved
[time=143] us that He gave His only begotten Son.
[time=146] Love was when God gave His Son to this earth.
[time=165] Love was when God he gave a man, love in dire sayings with a prayer for us.
[time=187] Love was born up to its gain. Just a carbon dirt with some picture made.
[time=211] Love was when Jesus walked in history.
[time=222] Love made me proud. Love was born up to its gain.
[time=246] Love was born up to its gain.
[time=276] Love made me proud. Love was born up to its gain.
[time=298] Love was born up to its gain.
[time=324] Love made me proud. Love made me proud. Love made me proud.
[time=344] Love was born up to its gain.
[time=390] This morning I would like to read for you one of the great passages of the Old Testament that assures us that God sees us and he knows our needs.
[time=468] I have read for you one of the great passages of the Old Testament that assures us and he knows our needs.
[time=488] A few days after the living Christmas tree concert had been completed and all of the energy had been expended I got in the mail this brief communication from one of the men of our church.
[time=504] I think all of you who both participated in it and had the opportunity of sharing it will appreciate the effort that has gone into making this presentation.
[time=514] The communication was introduced this way. This story is inspired by the living Christmas tree pageant and dedicated to all who participated in its creation and production.
[time=526] Whether in the tree or behind the scenes for the Black Hawk Baptist Church Christmas program of December 1978 may God add his blessings to this message and then these words were written by Charles Waltemuth who is a part of our fellowship and here are the words.
[time=544] When one surveys the forest green from the hillside so serene he can scarcely tell the trees apart yet every branch is a work of art.
[time=554] And every tree is a part of God's plan to be enjoyed by the sons of man.
[time=560] But I am a tree of man's creation with the Son of God as my inspiration I have unusual anatomy for I am the living Christmas tree.
[time=572] My frame is formed of welded steel sturdy but when naked so unreal yet when I'm covered with bows of pine my countenance begins to shine.
[time=582] I am blessed with lights around my girth and in honor of our Savior's birth to exemplify his peace and love upon my boughs rest many adove a labor of love created me yes I am your living Christmas tree.
[time=599] My nerves are an electronic masterpiece and to ensure that your love will never cease they are matched with the greatest of skill and pride that my lights and sounds will coincide as my heart and voices proclaim with mirth the story of the virgin birth.
[time=618] And this is the way it was meant to be for all of God's children who created me was not to win personal fortune or fame but to glorify thy holy name I am pleased O Lord to honor thee as thy humble living Christmas tree.
[time=635] And I thought that really shared what is in our hearts as we have enjoyed that pageant I know this will embarrass him but Charlie we you stand up so everybody will know who you are Charles Walton with and just stay there for a moment till they can find you I think we ought to express our appreciation to him thank you very much.
[time=661] And all of this time while I've been reading Bob Vanetta has been standing here not knowing I was going to do that but he's going to sing and he's going to sing a song that fits right in with our saying thank you to the Lord for his goodness to us reminding us that all that he has done for us all that we are in him.
[time=677] We'll read down back to his glory as we pay our tribute to the Lord of heaven.
[time=701] Can I say thanks for the things you have done for me things so undeserved yet you give to prove your love to me the voices of a million angels.
[time=729] I could not express my gratitude of that I am and ever hope to be I owe it all to thee to God be the glory to God be the glory.
[time=757] God be the glory for the things he has done for his heart.
[time=779] Can I say thanks for the things you have done for me things so undeserved yet you give to prove your love to me.
[time=799] Let it be pleasing Lord to be and should I gain any praise. Let it go to Calvary with his blood.
[time=819] Let it be pleasing Lord to be and should I gain any praise.
[time=841] Let it be pleasing Lord to be and should I gain any praise. Let it go to Calvary with his blood.
[time=867] Let it be pleasing Lord to be and should I gain any praise. Let it be pleasing Lord to be and should I gain any praise.
[time=891] Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today and for giving us this opportunity during the reception of the offering here in the convocation center to sit down and talk with you in your homes as you share the Bible Hour on this Sunday.
[time=915] Joining me today is my wife Donna and we usually spend a few moments just talking together about the things that pertain to our many friends at home.
[time=923] Donna, we have been receiving some tremendous response to the book that we have been using during the Christmas season and now during this first part of the new year.
[time=935] The book that I'm very excited about is people study the life of Christ. Why don't you tell our friends at home just a little bit about this special book, the four gospels arranged as a single narrative.
[time=947] It's really neat because it takes all of the events of the gospels and particularly pertain to the life of Christ and puts them in the order in which they occurred so that if you're reading in Matthew and you want to find the comparable passages in the other gospels, they are right there with it so that you don't have to search for them.
[time=964] The thing that's so helpful in studying the New Testament gospels this way is that the events are put together in the book chronologically, which of course does not happen in the scriptures since each of the four gospels was written thematically in other words to teach a certain theme using the life of Christ to support the various themes that are found in the book as a Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=988] Here all of the events are put together so that you can read the life of Christ as the New Testament chronicles that in the four gospels.
[time=995] Not I was sharing with you just before we went on the air that there's another exciting feature to this book at the at the back of the book that I think is a great help in studying the scripture too.
[time=1005] There is a convenient index at the back which categorizes all of the miracles and parables of Christ and they're in alphabetical order so if you're looking for one you just turn to it there and it tells you on what page you may find it.
[time=1019] How many times have you been studying the New Testament and remembered the story of some event in the life of Christ and you wanted to use it as an illustration or perhaps you wanted to use it to support something that you were studying and you just weren't sure where it was.
[time=1033] Here they're listed alphabetically in an index and it has the page number in the book where that scripture is recorded and then you would see all of the gospels accounts of that particular event.
[time=1043] There are also some helpful footnotes at the bottom of the pages and we're just so excited about this book the four gospels arranged as a single narrative and it's our gift to you during the season of the year.
[time=1053] You may receive your free gift by calling this number 1-800-247-2160. Don I understand from some of our friends that they may have had some difficulty during the Christmas season of getting through to the operators because the response was so great.
[time=1070] So I think we ought to encourage them to keep trying even if the line is busy and even even the next day perhaps if you haven't been able to get through on Sunday.
[time=1079] The operators are there all the time, aren't they? 24 hours a day, excuse me. Another way that you might prefer to contact us is by the mail.
[time=1088] We love to receive your letters and it's more of a personal response to us and we enjoy them and if you would like to write to us, write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 1-5-2-5-0, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 4-6-8-1-5.
[time=1105] And of course I guess I would urge you if you do have difficulty getting through on the telephone, don't be discouraged about it. Maybe that's God's direction to you to sit down and write us a letter.
[time=1114] We do want to encourage you however to go to the phone as the most convenient way of getting in touch with us and calling 1-800-247-2160.
[time=1123] It is the number of the Bible hour operators office and it will help us to get back to you with this literature that we know will be a help in your own spiritual life.
[time=1133] Now we want to say just a word to all of you who are sharing this telecast outside of Fort Wayne. We're on a number of stations that carry the Bible hour into your city and we thank God for the privilege of extending this ministry to you.
[time=1147] We want to take just this moment as we begin this new year to tell you how very important each and every one of you really is to the Bible hour. We cannot sustain the ministry of the Bible hour in the other areas where it is seen unless those areas support the ministry themselves.
[time=1163] Each of the stations we feel ought to be self-supporting. Right now that is not true. The station here in Fort Wayne has a tremendous response and some of the other stations are self-supporting but some are not.
[time=1176] We would like to ask you right now if the Bible hour is meaningful in your life and in your home and you would like to see its ministry continue in your area to sit down and write us a letter and in the letter express your appreciation for the Bible hour and your support of it both in prayer and in financial assistance.
[time=1195] We'd be glad to hear from many of you this week as you share the Bible hour in your area. As we begin the first of the year it's a great encouragement to know that this ministry is reaching you where you are and that you're supporting it with your prayers and your financial support.
[time=1211] In just a moment we're going to be opening the Word of God to the Old Testament book of Exodus and sharing a message for the new year and I hope that you'll stay with us as we share together God's truth before we go back to the morning service. Don I think you ought to remind them again of that special number that puts them in contact with us for this special Bible hour gift.
[time=1232] That toll free number again is 1-800-247-2160. Be sure and ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like the book on the four gospels and we will get it into the mail to you right away.
[time=1247] And we want to say again that we appreciate each and every one of you especially our founders club partners and family and we want to extend you the very best for this new year as you walk together with the Lord and serve him in your home in your family in your life.
[time=1277] My life was out of tune and happiness eluded me.
[time=1306] My life was dissonant in missing inner harmony but then I met the Savior and received his gift of grace and now my heart sings melody.
[time=1329] Jesus is my soul.
[time=1344] Jesus is my music.
[time=1359] Jesus is my soul.
[time=1374] Jesus is my music.
[time=1415] I played with earthly toys and emptiness frustrated me.
[time=1422] My life was just a noise in missing sensitivity but then I met the Savior and saw His matchless face and now my life's a synchrony.
[time=1444] Jesus is my music.
[time=1494] I want to sing His praises all day long.
[time=1524] And it's good to have a melody in your heart to be able to share that melody and let that melody become your life.
[time=1543] The Bible says that the joy of the Lord is our strength and what a reminder to us that in this year that is before us we will find great joy as we trust and sing about the Savior.
[time=1563] Jesus is my music and it's good to have a melody in my heart to be able to share that melody and let that melody become your life.
[time=1583] We are studying the life of Moses in the evening services of our church and I'm jumping out of sequence here just to take one incident that really gripped me as I thought about these very crucial days before us as we enter this new year.
[time=1598] I'm reading from Exodus chapter 33 and I'm beginning my reading at verse 11.
[time=1604] And the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of none a young man departed not out of the tabernacle.
[time=1617] And Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said I know thee by name and thou had also found grace in my sight.
[time=1632] Now therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may know thee that I might find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest.
[time=1655] And he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up from here for wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth shall we pray.
[time=1678] Father there is something within each of us today that cries out with Moses the words of this prayer we pray that you will apply its truth to our own hearts today.
[time=1690] So we see it first of all in its historical context and then as we make those applications which are pertinent to us speak to our hearts by way of encouragement and strength speak to each of us and use these moments to prepare us for these days ahead of us as we look to the future.
[time=1707] For we pray in Jesus name and for his sake amen.
[time=1712] I'm convinced that one of God's glorious gifts to mankind is to bestow upon him the dawn of a new year.
[time=1721] New opportunities and challenges set before him chance to try again if you will to make another endeavor to success to successfully accomplish the ambitions which were cast aside with discouragement in the year that has passed.
[time=1740] Seems to me that life is full of beginnings as you stand at the gate and with a very quivering and doubtful hand draw side the curtain of a new year and peer into the unknown you cannot help but be filled with a sense of expectation and mystery sense of fear and expectation.
[time=1763] You cannot help but look back upon the year past and gaze into the known history wondering what happened in the past that kept you from achieving the goals that you set out to achieve as you began the year just concluded.
[time=1783] Sometimes you see 65 days of pages that are marred with failures and torn by intentions can't help but think of the him writer who wrote through many dangers toils and snares I have already come to a grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.
[time=1804] Something about standing at the crossroads of an old year and a new year that causes you to seriously reflect upon the importance of God's grace in your life both in the past and as you anticipate the future.
[time=1820] I can't help but think that it was such an occasion as this that caught hold of Moses heart when he lifted his voice to the Lord and prayed the prayer that I have just read.
[time=1831] And what happened to him was the land of Egypt. Before him in the distant unknown future was the land of promise and between Egypt and the land of promise was a long journey in the wilderness.
[time=1846] If you read the record that precedes the 33rd chapter of the book of Exodus carefully you will discover that Moses and the people of Israel have perhaps just experienced the most bitter, disappointing, devastating time in their history.
[time=1860] It is a study in contrast if you will. Moses had ascended the mountain, the mountain of God, there to receive from the Lord's hand the holy decalogue, the inscripturated law of God.
[time=1874] It had been a glorious moment for this man who was called God's friend.
[time=1880] So impressed was he by the glory of God that the scripture records when he came down from the mountain. His face did shine as if the glory of God, the chicana glory of God still had left its print upon him.
[time=1895] But oh what a sight he found when he came back down to his people while he had been away ministering the ministry of the covenant with God, his people.
[time=1907] Because of the lack of leadership and because of their carnality and their desire to be affiliated with the peoples around them had stooped to the very lowest level of idolatry, had constructed a golden calf out of the melted down jewelry which was theirs and had begun to worship as the pagans around them.
[time=1925] And Moses was so overwhelmed with hurt and disappointment that he prayed an earlier prayer that's recorded back in the 32nd chapter of the book of Exodus.
[time=1939] God's judgment was flashing with the fire from Mount Sinai and he threatened to wipe out the entire generation of Israelites.
[time=1948] Moses himself was discouraged and disheartened. We read this prayer in chapter 32 of Exodus beginning at the 30th verse.
[time=1957] And it came to pass on the next day that Moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord. Perhaps I can make an atonement for your sin.
[time=1968] Moses returned unto the Lord and said all this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold and now if thou wilt forgive their sin and notice it's an unfinished sentence.
[time=1980] Now if thou wilt forgive their sin and Moses said and if not, blot me I pray the out of thy book which thou has written.
[time=1988] And the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
[time=1993] Therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee, behold my angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when I visit.
[time=2002] I will visit their sin upon them and the Lord plague the people because they made the calf which Aaron made.
[time=2009] This terrible incident in the life of Israel was in the background of Moses prayer.
[time=2015] God had said to Moses you're going to lead these people to the promised land. Little did Moses know that in between the statement of that promise and the fulfillment of that promise he would spend the last one third of his lifetime wandering around in the wilderness experiencing very difficult experience as well.
[time=2033] The people that had sinned against God died off in a new generation arose which was capable of going into the land of promise.
[time=2041] This prayer that we read a few moments ago from the thirty third chapter of Deuteronomy was the prayer of a very disappointed man.
[time=2049] You can enter into it just a moment as you contemplate what happens in your own heart when your children disobey.
[time=2058] When they walk out of the context of what you desire for them there is a sense of awesome disappointment that takes over in your life.
[time=2066] I sense that's what was in the heart of Moses coming back from his communication with God and finding the people to whom God had sent him involved in the most despicable of sins against the holy God with whom he had been communicating.
[time=2080] He was disappointed and I believe he was discouraged over in the thirty third chapter verses twelve and thirteen there is a note of discouragement in his words.
[time=2090] He says I know the by he says I want to know who you're going to send with me as I lead these people. God I don't I don't want to be with these people by myself.
[time=2100] I don't want to lead these people alone who will you send with me on the on the rest of this journey.
[time=2105] How will I know that you're going with me? I'm discouraged Lord. I don't know if I can handle any more of the Israelites and their failure, the awful sinfulness of these Jews and there's a long journey ahead of me.
[time=2117] How will I know that you're going to go with me? It was the prayer of a discouraged man. I want you to notice the wording of his prayer.
[time=2125] The wording of his prayer is very very very pertinent, very concise. He had basically two or three requests that were on his heart. First of all he said show me now thy way that I may know thee.
[time=2139] Lord I want you to lay out before me the plan for these next years and I want you to show me the way I'm supposed to walk because I want to walk in your way.
[time=2148] I want to be able to go out into the future unknown and be certain that I am in your way doing your will leading these people in the way they should go.
[time=2158] Lord show me your way. I can't help but pause for a moment and say that that's what's in the heart of every one of us as we face the new year.
[time=2166] We would all, if we were honest, like for God to write out for us a day by day of personal prescription for every one of the 365 days in 1979.
[time=2179] And on that prescription have him say this is my will for you on this day, January 1. And this is my will for you on this day, January 2.
[time=2188] And on and on through the wheel and we would have this little almond act that we could carry and we would know God's will. Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? Have an idea that's what Moses wanted.
[time=2198] Moses wanted to know the detailed plan of God. He would have if you will a map that God would give to him showing him every stop along the way, every step along the way that was his desire to know God's way for his life.
[time=2213] And then he said show me thy way direct my path and his second question was Lord, who will you send with me? I want to know your way and I want to know who's going with me to give guidance and direction.
[time=2226] I have never faced a year ahead like we face this year as a church body. Never have I ever sensed like I sense now the same emotions that Moses must have felt.
[time=2238] Show me thy way and Lord, who are you going to send with me? Who will you send along with me to give me guidance and direction? Who will thou send with me into 1979?
[time=2250] How can I know your way and your will in 1979? How will I find grace in thy sight in 1979? That was his prayer. That was the desire of his heart.
[time=2263] If you're walking in fellowship with the Lord today as a Christian, that's certainly ought to be something of the emotion that wells up within you as you see the old year fading into the past and the new year on the horizon.
[time=2275] Lord, this has been a good year in many respects. It's been a difficult year in some respects, but now there's a new year, a clean slate, a new opportunity. Lord, show me thy way and walk with me into the future.
[time=2288] It was that prayer that precipitated one of the greatest promises found in the book of Exodus, the promise of the Lord God to this wavering servant of his.
[time=2299] Now I want you to notice with me the context of that promise could I give it to you as a special New Year's gift, a present as you will for 1979, a personal prescription for your New Year from the Old Testament book of Exodus.
[time=2314] Here was the answer of the Lord to the prayer of Moses, verse 14, and he said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
[time=2326] My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest." Say, have you ever noticed how often God doesn't answer the prayers that we pray?
[time=2338] Now let's think back for a moment. Moses said, "Lord, show me thy way," and there's not one word here about any map or direction. God did not answer Moses' prayer.
[time=2350] In essence, God did not give to Moses a map because he was going to be to Moses a guide and a friend.
[time=2359] He was not going to be a superintendent from heaven looking down over the life of Moses saying, "Turn right, turn left, go straight ahead." No, he was going to be an everlasting friend to walk with Moses in the way as he walked out into the wilderness and through the desert.
[time=2375] As Moses would travel in those next days in the desert with a sand upon his feet as it would sit by his tent to discuss with the leaders of Israel, the directions fall the next day as he sat in counsel with the elders of the people or as he fought the battles that were before him.
[time=2391] He would not have a detailed prescription, a detailed set of orders, but better than that God had promised him something that supersedes any map, any direction he had promised to him to be a guide.
[time=2407] That wasn't what Moses asked for, and how often it is true that he does exceedingly, abundantly above all that we can ask or think. We ask for a map, and instead he becomes our guide.
[time=2422] Say, have you ever been lost in a city? I have a faculty for being lost most of the time. Wherever I go, I've been here 10 years and I'm learning the main routes in Fort Wayne and a few more years and I'll about have that down, but if I go to a strange city, I stop at every gas station along the way for further instructions.
[time=2442] And on occasion, I have been lost in a city and stopped for directions and had someone say, "Oh, by the way, I'm going that way. Just follow me and I'll take you there."
[time=2453] Do you know that's like music to my soul? That is the most wonderful news you can ever hear when you're lost.
[time=2463] Because usually, when you stop at a gas station to get instructions, you ask for instructions. They'll say, "Well, you go to the fourth light turn left, go down to the third gas station, turn right, follow the red lane."
[time=2473] And by the time they get all done, you've forgotten what they said first, and you're too embarrassed to ask them to go over it again, so you get in your car and you go on and you take another wrong turn.
[time=2481] Pretty soon, you assume you're lost and you stop at another gas station and go through the same routine. By the way, you laugh most of you've been there.
[time=2488] But all what joy it is to a man's heart who doesn't know the way when someone comes and says, "Listen, I'll go with you and I'll show you the way. I'll be your guide."
[time=2503] I'd rather have a guide any day than a map, wouldn't you?
[time=2508] [AMEN] So Moses asked for a map and God provided him a guide. I want you to notice the wording of his promise. He said, "My presence will go with you."
[time=2521] You know, the word presence in this text is really the word for face.
[time=2527] And you know, this is an incongruity in the Old Testament scripture for the Bible says, "No man has seen God's face and lived," and yet the Bible says that Moses spoke with God as a man speaks face to face.
[time=2539] He didn't speak to him face to face, but he spoke to him in the same proximity of intimacy as a man speaks face to face with a friend.
[time=2547] And now God in this wonderful promise is said to Moses, "Listen, when you go on your way, my face will go with you. My presence will be with you.
[time=2558] I am going to accompany you on your journey." I want you to go back with me to the 33rd chapter in the first few verses, and I want you to notice what a great encouragement this must have been to Moses.
[time=2572] When God recognized the sin of the people of Israel while Moses was on the mount with the Lord, he became angry with the people.
[time=2582] And on the basis of Moses' prayer in the 32nd chapter, he was going to blot them out. Now I want you to read with me the first three verses of this 33rd chapter.
[time=2591] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Depart and go up from here, Thou in the people whom Thou hast brought out the land of Egypt unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, Isaac and to Jacob, saying unto them unto thy seed will I give it.
[time=2602] And I will send an angel before the drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Parasite, the Hiveite and the Jebusite."
[time=2611] "Unto a land flowing with milk and honey, for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee in the way."
[time=2625] God said, "Moses, these people are so stubborn and stiff-necked and sinful, I'm not going to walk in the midst of them. I'm sending an angel. Take care of you. I'm not going to walk with you."
[time=2636] And if you'd have been Moses, you'd ask the same question, "Lord, who is going to go with me? Who will Thou send to walk with me into the unknown future? I don't understand this. I can't explain it all."
[time=2651] But God said, "Okay Moses, I'll go with you. My presence will go with you."
[time=2660] Do you know, as I've fought back over this past year, I've stood at the cemetery with some of you. I've stood at the Mary Jalter with some of you.
[time=2673] I've sat in the counseling room with some of you. I've watched tragedy strike some of your homes, seen some of our homes come apart.
[time=2688] None of those things I could have anticipated at the beginning of 1978.
[time=2694] And as I stand at the front end of this year, I recognize that inevitably with this many people, before the year is over, the unexpected will happen.
[time=2706] There will be difficulties and joys, unexpected problems and difficulties that we could no way prepare for. And oh, what a joy it is to know that His presence goes with me, that His presence walks with me into the new year.
[time=2725] And you know that means so much. I could dwell on that for so many moments, what it means to have the presence of God. He dwells with us as a pitying friend in the time of sorrow.
[time=2736] He dwells with us as a purifying friend in the time of sin.
[time=2743] Plato once said that God is more inward to us than we are to ourselves. God is closer to us than the next breath.
[time=2751] He is so much with us that we cannot describe the intimacy with which we walk with Him when He dwells in us and we in Him.
[time=2759] If I have a map, I may lose my way, but if I have a guide, I shall not lose direction.
[time=2765] Who will go with me in 79? The presence of God. And how will I know the way? He will show me, for His presence goes with me.
[time=2778] Oh, but there's something else here. The second part of His promise is even better than the first part.
[time=2784] In a generation that seems to have turned to Alka Selser as its national beverage and is on the tram so fast that it's like an eternally revolving door, the Bible says that Jesus Christ, the Old Testament, Jehovah, the presence of God goes with us and He goes with us to give us rest.
[time=2803] Oh, after the season, we've just been through what words of glory those are. I will give you rest. We were so tired after all of the presentations here and just fatigued.
[time=2817] You know, there are two kinds of rest that the Bible speaks about, and I want to take just a moment to talk about them.
[time=2823] Two kinds of rest. There is the kind of rest that comes after work. Some of us, after these last few days of frenzied activity, went away for a couple of days to rest. We were tired.
[time=2835] We wanted to get recovered. We wanted to renew our strength. The lying down of the weary. That's this kind of rest. It's the kind of rest that comes at the end of a long march or the kind of rest that comes on the day after a hard battle.
[time=2850] Or the kind of rest that comes when you've reached the summit of the hill. It's interesting to note that one day in the future Moses would experience this kind of rest when he stood on Mount Pisga and he literally died in the arms of the Lord resting after his long and fruitful life as Israel's leader, but it is not that kind of rest that the Lord promises here.
[time=2874] We said to Moses, "When you go into the wilderness with all of the problems that are there, my presence goes with you into the wilderness, and I will give you rest in the wilderness."
[time=2885] I will walk with you, and this is not the kind of rest that comes after toil. This is the kind of rest that comes in the midst of it.
[time=2893] It is the kind of rest that can be described as the absence of the terror of judgment when we feel condemned.
[time=2900] It is the kind of rest that is rest from anxiety within. It is the kind of rest that is the rest from an unsatisfied spirit.
[time=2909] It is the kind of rest that is rest from the apprehension of the future. It is the kind of rest that is described in the New Testament as the peace of God which passeth all understanding.
[time=2921] When God said to Moses, "When you walk out into the future, my presence goes with you, and because my presence is with you, you will have rest.
[time=2929] You will be able to face all of the difficulties around you, and there will be a sweet, tranquil spirit in the midst of it that enables you to take all that the world throws at you and stay in step with God."
[time=2941] That's the kind of rest he promises. As I think about the schedules and the responsibilities and all that is involved in serving God and in just living life in these days, one of the great promises he could give to us in this New Year is this.
[time=2956] If you will walk with me, if you will acknowledge my presence in your life, you can have the rest that comes from God.
[time=2964] It is the eternal and deep repose, the liberty of spirit which is found a hidden refuge and retreat where feeling is calm, and though the march goes on and the battle continues and the climb goes on, there is within your heart a settled peace that you are in the presence of God and all as well.
[time=2987] Moses was about to face the last one-third of his life. He would be thinking and ruling and guiding some of the most difficult people that ever lived on the face of God's earth, some of the most rebellious, and according to the Lord's words, stiff-necked people.
[time=3003] He would stand alone as the representative of God to them, as their leader, as the one who explained the death that was going on all about them and the absence of the promised land which they had been so looking forward to.
[time=3016] Yet in the midst of that, God said to that leader, "You don't stand alone. My presence is with you and you can be at peace in the midst of all of that."
[time=3028] Could I pause for just a moment and say to you that we need not only the prayer for divine assistance and the promise of divine assistance, but all that God would impress upon us, the heart cry of Moses to accept the priority of divine assistance.
[time=3044] Notice what he said, verse 15, Moses said, "Lord, if thy presence go not with me, carry us not up from here."
[time=3056] I guess we all have to come to a point in our life where we're willing to say that, Lord, if you're not going to be in this, if you're not going to be with me, if you don't go with me, if your presence is not a part of this endeavor, I don't want anything to do with it.
[time=3071] Lord, don't let me go anywhere where I don't sense your presence and your blessing and your guidance, if your presence be not with me, send me not up hither.
[time=3081] And I would stand at the threshold of this new year and I believe speak for many of you who know the Lord Jesus Christ and say in your behalf, as I say in my behalf, Lord, if you go not with us into 1979, let us not go.
[time=3094] So the year is filled with foreboding signs on every side, with the threat of war and some of the major sections of the world and all kinds of internal and domestic problems with financial struggle and inflation and all of the difficulties of a world that could harbor the kinds of people we've been reading about in our papers just this past week.
[time=3115] The world that's frightening when you think of rearing children in it, it is a world that is filled with threatening signs on every side and yet I can say with honesty if the presence of God goes with us, we can have rest in the midst of it all.
[time=3129] And at the same time I can say, Lord, if your presence co-not with us, take us not from here, the priority. I wish I had time to discuss with you the fact that it is this presence of God among his people that sets his people apart from others.
[time=3145] You'll read on in the text that Moses said, how will the people of the world know that we belong to you unless they sense your presence with us? How is the world going to know the Christian unless they sense that among the anxiety of the world and on every side people flipping out and tripping out, there are a group of Christian people who have the presence of God in their lives who are stable and are calm and are filled with peace and rest.
[time=3169] It is that which separates the Christian from the world. Notice what Moses said, "For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight, is it not in that thou goest with us, so shall we be separated. I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth."
[time=3186] And that's true today. You get a bunch of God's people together who are trusting in the Lord and recognizing the presence of the Lord and they're set apart from the world.
[time=3195] We ought to be, according to the Scripture, "Oh, what a promise, the presence of the Lord." That's my present to you for the new year. This wonderful promise of the Lord was, you face 1979, the Lord has promised that His presence goes with you and with His presence comes His rest.
[time=3214] The other day, I took my youngest daughter to the drugstore with me and while I was waiting on a prescription, she wandered off in the direction of that beautiful section of the drugstore known as the toy department.
[time=3236] It is obvious to all of you that she has been there with me before and she was oblivious to all that was going on. I waited for the prescription and I had to go to another section of the store to get something else and she was wandering around through the toys.
[time=3252] All of a sudden, she realized that I wasn't anywhere to be seen and I envisioned in my mind that she looked around and up and down the aisle where she was and I wasn't there.
[time=3265] I was about three aisles over, in fact, and I began to hear a little whimper in between a few quiet calls for daddy.
[time=3275] I didn't know where she was. I heard her and I tried to move toward her voice and I saw her standing there with her head bowed and her hands kind of covered her face and her back just sort of shaking a little bit and she was afraid.
[time=3287] She was lost and I walked up behind her and I said, "Genefer, I'm here," and she looked up at me and all of a sudden there was no frown, no cries, a big smile came over her face.
[time=3303] In my presence, there was peace. Do you see? In the world in which we live, we can be lost and confused and difficulties come in every direction.
[time=3316] We don't know where we are sometimes and we are like little children. We put our hands over our face and we whimper.
[time=3324] Lord, what's it all about? And all of a sudden we look up and he's there. And in his presence, there is peace, there is rest.
[time=3336] May I encourage you this year to cultivate your relationship with him. His presence is always there as much as one time as it is at another.
[time=3347] But it is your coldness of heart that keeps you from participating in the blessings that go with that. As you cultivate and practice the presence of Christ in your own life, you will discover the sweet, rest, and peace that will come into your life and give you guidance and direction.
[time=3366] Shall we bow together in prayer?

[time=3537] I knew that joy once of the presence of God and the acknowledgement of that presence in my life, but it hasn't been there because I've not been walking in fellowship with him.
[time=3547] Would you pray for me today? Anyone else? Yes, up in the balcony. Thank you. I don't want 19.
