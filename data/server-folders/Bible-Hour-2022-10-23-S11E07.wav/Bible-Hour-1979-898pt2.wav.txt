[time=0] The economy of the day of our Lord, but so wide sweeping has this parable been known
[time=8] that the word talent has been transposed into our society, and now it represents all that a man has, both his ability, his responsibility, and his money.
[time=19] The word talent in this passage is first and primarily a word which represents financial
[time=25] involvement, and so what we have here is the story of what some folks did with that which God entrusted to their care.
[time=33] Now it's interesting to me that the parable of the talents follows hard upon the parable of the virgins.
[time=39] In the same chapter, we are taught through the parable of the virgins the importance of waiting for the Lord's return.
[time=46] If you have read that passage, you know that the virgins, according to this passage of the scripture, were waiting for the return of the Lord, and some were ready and some were not, and the parable teaches that it's important to be ready when the Lord returns.
[time=61] It is interesting to me that the parable of the talents follows the parable of the virgins in order that we might keep two very important truths in balance.
[time=70] One is that it's important to be waiting for the Lord, but the other is that it's important to be working for the Lord.
[time=76] We have an awful lot of folks who can wait for the Lord.
[time=78] They are prophecy nuts, and they know all of the details of prophecy.
[time=82] They're waiting for the Lord.
[time=84] The problem is no one can get them involved in working for the Lord.
[time=87] And God sees this in a wonderful balance in the parable of the virgins.
[time=92] He teaches us to be ready, waiting for God and the Lord to come back.
[time=96] In the parable of the talents, He teaches us the importance of occupying till He comes.
[time=102] Now this parable is crucial for our day, for it is obvious to all of us who are in places
[time=108] of responsibility in the ministry of the Lord Jesus.
[time=111] That the one problem we have in our circles is not that we don't have enough individuals to get the task done, but that we do not have enough of the individuals who have signed up who are committed to that which they have signed up to do.
[time=125] In our churches, like ours and other churches of our size, we have a tremendous personnel problem.
[time=130] It is always our task to be finding men and women to be involved in the ministries which
[time=136] must be carried forth if the church is to thrive in the gospel.
[time=140] It is always our task in leadership to try to find those who are a part of the ministry of the church, many times committed members of the church, and get them involved under the load so that the work is carried on many shoulders instead of on a few.
[time=154] The problem that is represented in the parable of the talents is a significant one.
[time=159] It means in its teaching that we need to understand what it is that God has given to us to do, and we are to do it.
[time=167] Now I want you to notice several things about this parable.
[time=169] First of all, I want you to know the reason for the stewardship.
[time=173] It is found in verse 14, and in the 14th verse we read that the stewardship was necessary because a man was traveling into a far country and he needed someone to represent him in
[time=184] his absence, and so the Scripture says he called his servants together.
[time=188] He lined them up, perhaps in the conference room, and he said to them, "I am going to be gone for a period of time.
[time=194] I am giving you all of my goods, and I am asking you to represent me now in that which
[time=200] is in my interest in the future.
[time=202] Here is all that belongs to me in this area.
[time=205] You have some of it.
[time=206] You have some.
[time=208] While I am gone, you take care of the affairs of state as it relates to me.
[time=213] It is obvious that this is a picture of the fact that when the Lord Jesus went back to heaven, having come from the Father to provide salvation for us on the cross, he gathered his apostles together as representatives of all of us, and he committed to the apostles the ministry of the gospel.
[time=231] He said to them, "I am giving you to do that which represents my kingdom in this age.
[time=237] It is a startling and sobering fact to me when I read this parable that all that pertains
[time=243] to God in practice and in ministry in this world today is carried on by his servants."
[time=251] God is not personally, physically involved in his world today as an entity.
[time=258] Somebody says to me, "Where is Jesus Christ?
[time=260] He is in heaven.
[time=261] Where is God the Father?
[time=262] He is in heaven.
[time=263] Where is the Holy Spirit?
[time=264] Where is He class?
[time=265] He lives within the lives of every believer, and therefore the only work that God can get
[time=271] done in his world today, he has to get done through spirit-empowered believers.
[time=276] That is why when Jesus went back to heaven, he gave the great commission.
[time=280] He said, "All power is given unto me.
[time=283] Go ye therefore into all the world and preach the gospel." We have been commissioned as the servants of the Lord to carry on the master's business in his absence.
[time=293] And now he is back in heaven, and we are here.
[time=295] And men and women, it is an awesome thing to remember that we represent the Lord and we are responsible for the affairs of the Lord Jesus Christ in this world today.
[time=304] Notice that at the end of the 15th verse, he says, it says, "That after he had dispensed
[time=310] all of these gifts and responsibilities to the stewards, that straight way he took his journey.
[time=316] After the Lord had given the great commission and challenged the people of the church to do his work, he went back to heaven and he leaves us here to carry on the responsibilities
[time=326] of the Lord's work." Let me say it again.
[time=330] God cannot do anything in this world apart from a human body which is dedicated to the
[time=336] cause of Christ.
[time=337] It is not that he cannot because he is unable, it is that he will not because he is chosen and deigned to work through his children.
[time=344] He has no hands but our hands.
[time=346] He has no feet but our feet.
[time=348] He has no lips but our lips, no eyes but our eyes, no ears but our ears.
[time=353] God is using men and women today in stewardship to carry on his work.
[time=357] He is in heaven.
[time=358] We are here.
[time=359] We are responsible for the ministry of the gospel.
[time=363] That is the reason for the stewardship.
[time=365] Men and women, the reason why I must be careful with what I do with my money and my abilities is because that doesn't belong to me.
[time=373] That belongs to my father.
[time=375] And he has given me the responsibility of discharging that in this world in his absence
[time=381] until he comes back again for his own.
[time=384] The reason for the stewardship.
[time=386] This is secondly the rationale for the stewardship.
[time=389] It says in verse 15 that he gave one five talents, he gave another two and he gave another one.
[time=395] That just blows the minds of all of those who believe that every person is created with equal ability to serve.
[time=401] All men are equal in worth in the eyes of God.
[time=405] Every person that's ever been born into this world is of the same value and worth to the Lord but not every person has been endowed with the same ability to serve.
[time=417] And we are foolish when we think that because we are Christians we are all equally endowed in the same areas to serve God.
[time=425] If you've ever been in a church where they believe that you know how awful that can be.
[time=429] When someone who has not been endowed with a ministry of music considers the fact that they have been equally endowed with someone who has the ministry of music and all of the body suffers through that experience.
[time=441] Or you have been in a church where someone who has the idea that they have been endowed as a teacher is equally as someone else who has been endowed as a teacher but it is obvious that they do not have that gift and the whole class suffers.
[time=454] The Bible says that God has dispensed to each man severly according to his abilities.
[time=459] Now I want you to notice how this stewardship was distributed.
[time=463] First of all it was distributed according to the judgment of God.
[time=467] This is very important for us to understand.
[time=470] There is an awful tendency in our circles today to be involved in the ministry of comparison.
[time=475] Why do they have more than I do?
[time=477] Why is that church bigger than ours?
[time=479] Why do they have more ability than I have?
[time=481] Why can she sing better than I can?
[time=485] I want you to notice something in this text that the Lord distributed the gifts.
[time=491] And someone says to me why did he do it?
[time=493] First of all he did it according to his own purpose.
[time=496] In I Corinthians 1211 a passage that deals with the gifts of the Spirit.
[time=501] The Bible says but all these work at that one and the self same Spirit giving to every man severly as he chooses.
[time=510] Here is the sovereignty of God in action.
[time=513] God sovereignly determining that he is going to endow someone with five talents and another one with one talent and another with two or three.
[time=522] It is the sovereign purpose of God.
[time=525] Now if we could understand that man and women it would take an awful lot of the tension out of our lives.
[time=531] If I am a two-talent man and not a five-talent man that is not my problem.
[time=534] That is God's problem.
[time=535] All I have to do is say Lord you have given me two and thank you for it I will do everything I can to be faithful to it.
[time=543] Frankly it is almost easier to be a two-talent man than it is to be a five-talent man.
[time=546] I would not want to be a ten-talent or an eight-talent or a five-talent man because there is so much more responsibility that goes with it.
[time=553] So much more that has to be discharged.
[time=556] But the issue is this.
[time=557] The issue is God does it according to his will.
[time=560] Now that takes all pride out of the picture.
[time=563] I remember reading in the first book of Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7 it says it is so plain
[time=569] that you can't miss it.
[time=570] It says this, "For who make a thee to differ from another?
[time=573] You have five and he has one, you have six and he has two.
[time=576] Who makes you to differ from another?
[time=579] And what do you have that you did not receive?
[time=582] The five-talent man got his from the Lord, just like the one-talent man got his from the Lord." Now notice what Paul says.
[time=587] He says, "But every man has his proper gift and if you did receive it why do you glory
[time=594] as if you didn't receive it?" Every once in a while someone who has ability that God has given him gives the impression that it is something they did themselves.
[time=602] But men and women what we have from God in our money, in our talent, in our responsibility let us never forget that no matter how big or how small that endowment is, it is a gift
[time=613] from God.
[time=614] He has given it to us.
[time=615] We don't earn it.
[time=616] We don't deserve it.
[time=617] There's not anything we've ever done to merit it.
[time=619] God sovereignly according to his judgment gave it to us.
[time=624] When I think of what God has done to bless this church, we have no right to be proud.
[time=628] Someone asked me why does the Black Hawk Baptist Church grow?
[time=631] Why is it ministering to more and more people?
[time=634] There's only one reason God has chosen to let that happen.
[time=637] And when I think of that, I'm just so grateful.
[time=638] I feel like I'm hanging on for the ride.
[time=641] And I'm grateful to God just to be a part of what He's chosen to do in this world in which we live.
[time=646] And that ought to be our spirit as it relates to the endowment of gifts and ministries.
[time=651] The rationale for all of this is that God gives to us severly according to His will.
[time=656] Now notice in the text that it also says, "He gives according to the several abilities
[time=662] of the individual. Someone has said that the several abilities is the empty vessel which God fills. Here is this vessel that God has made. And now He dispenses gifts into that
[time=673] empty vessel and He makes this vessel a vessel fit for the master's use. He does it according to the abilities which He has chosen to endow us with in His creative act.
[time=683] Now these talents that God gives us, the money, the ability, the individual qualities,
[time=689] these talents are given to us so that we might be fully equipped to serve God.
[time=695] I personally believe that a five-talent person is absolutely perfectly equipped to serve God.
[time=703] I believe that a two-talent person is perfectly equipped to serve God. I believe that a one-talent
[time=709] person is perfectly equipped to serve God. Someone has said there is no difference in the perfection between a little circle and a big circle. Both of them are perfect.
[time=720] I may not be perfect in that I am sinlessly perfect, but I am perfect for what God has chosen me to do. You may not be perfect in that you are sinlessly perfect, but you are perfect for the place where God has put you. God has given to you all that you need to
[time=735] be absolutely 100 percent faithful to Him in your situation. I get so tired of hearing people say, "Well, if God had just done this for me, or if I just had this, or if I just could do this, or if I could just do that, that isn't the issue men and women, the issue is what are you doing with what you have got?" And that is what you are going to answer to God for someday. Some folks say, "Well, if I had a $500,000, I would give more to the
[time=760] Lord." No, you wouldn't. If you had $500,000, you would give probably less than you give now, because if you are not faithful with what God has given to you, entrusted to you to
[time=771] give to His work now, you wouldn't be faithful if you had more. I think statistics demonstrate
[time=777] that the more we have, the harder it is to give it. God's work is not usually supported by the large donors, the large givers. God's work is supported by those who are faithful with what God has given them to administer in His behalf. So let us recognize that the
[time=793] rationale for the gift of ministry and stewardship and money to us is on the basis of God's sovereignty.
[time=799] Now I want you to notice, thirdly, not only the reason for this stewardship and the rationale to it, but let's look at the response to it on the part of these three men. The five talent man came, and when the Lord came back to get an account of what was happening in His absence, the five talent man came up, and he had doubled his endowment. He brought not only the five talents that had been given to him, but he brought five more. He had invested them, and they had multiplied for his master. The two talent man came likewise, and he presented
[time=826] his stewardship to the Lord. God, the Lord had given him two talents. He had invested them, and he brought not only the two he had been given, but two more beside. It's interesting that the Scripture teaches us that the five talent man and the two talent man seemed to be anticipating their master's return. They were looking forward to giving an account of what they had done. You know that's always true, isn't it? When we're given something to do, and we know that we have done what we should do, it's a great thing to look forward to the time of accountability. Let me give you a very mundane illustration. There were
[time=860] tests in school that I genuinely look forward to. I mean that with all my heart, but I can
[time=868] remember a few that I didn't look forward to at all. And the difference in my attitude toward the test wasn't the discipline of the class or the teacher. The difference in my attitude was the consciousness that I had been faithful in my stewardship to study for the test. I can remember going into classes and having someone pray. I went to Christian schools
[time=888] and to a seminary to study and having someone get up and pray, "Oh God, help us all to remember
[time=894] those things we have faithfully studied." And I would slink down in my chair, "Oh Lord, please do more than that. I need more than just than what I faithfully studied." Do you
[time=904] know what I'm talking about, don't you? There was an attitude of expectancy on the part of the stewards. Now we come to the third steward. He comes and he says, "Lord, I took
[time=915] the one talent you gave me and I was so afraid that I went and buried it." And here it is, Lord, I got just what you gave me. Notice the reward of the good stewards. First of all,
[time=930] in verse 21. When the five talent man presented his doubled investment, we're told that the
[time=939] Lord said unto him, "Well done, now good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou unto the joy of thy Lord." Notice verse 23. And he said unto the two talent man, "Well done, good and
[time=953] faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things. I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou unto the joy of thy Lord." What is obvious about those two verses? They are exactly the same. Why are they exactly the same? Because God does not
[time=966] differentiate in his reward between five talent men and two talent men. He gives exactly the
[time=972] same reward. And what is it based upon? It is based upon faithfulness to the stewardship
[time=978] God has entrusted to us. If I only have $100 and I'm faithful in dispensing that, I will
[time=984] get the same exact reward from my father in heaven as a man who has been a multi-millionaire and has given more than half of it to the Lord's work. Can you imagine that? I won't have to take a back seat to anyone in heaven who had more to dispense than I have had to dispense if I have been faithful in giving what God has called me to give. He gets exactly
[time=1004] the same reward in exactly the same words from the same master. Notice the three things
[time=1010] about his commendation. First of all, there was this commendation. "Well done, thou good
[time=1016] in faithful servant." And someone says, "If that's all I get from the Lord, that's all I need." Wouldn't it want to be tremendous to stand in the presence of the Lord someday and he looks over our lifetime audit and he examines it and then he looks up into our
[time=1031] face and he says, Jeremiah, well done son, you're a good in faithful servant. That's
[time=1038] all we need. That'll be enough reward for me. Say, if you want to have an illustration of that, you just stop and remember how important it was for you as a little child growing up
[time=1049] just to get the well done of the important people in your lives. I remember as a basketball player that when I was in junior high, I had a coach who never commended us. The fact he chewed on us most of the time. And I got so responsive to him that every time I'd do
[time=1065] something wrong, I'd look over to the bench in the middle of the game and I'd lose my concentration. It took me three years to break that habit even after I went to college because I never was commended even for the good things. And then I found a coach who knew what it was like to encourage someone by saying, well done. And that meant so much to me. I want to tell you something. Some day, all of us will have the opportunity to stand before God and hear his commendation if we have been faithful. Secondly, not only was there a commendation, but there was a promotion. The master came back and he said to the five talent man and the two talent man, I've given you something to do. You've done it well.
[time=1101] Now, I want to tell you what I'm going to do. I want to give you more to do. I'm going to multiply your responsibility. I hear every once in a while sermons on stewardship that talk about the Lord's big shovel and the stewards little shovel. You know of that old saying,
[time=1115] if you give to God with your little shovel, he gives back to you and his shovel is bigger?
[time=1119] Well, I've heard that. In fact, there are some pastors who have gone out on the limit have told their congregation, if you began to tithe and give to God like you should and he doesn't bless you in a wonderful way at the end of the year, come back and I'll give you all your money back. There is a pastor in Texas who's being sued by a parishioner because he tried it and it didn't work. I want to tell you something, I'm not going to say that. I'm going to steer clear of that. I'm going to stay clear away from it. Not that I don't believe God blesses those who are faithful, but we ought not to do it so we can get something. The principle here is this. When God looks down from his heavenly
[time=1153] vantage point and he recognizes that we're doing with what he's given us, what he wants us to do, then he says, "Well, let's see. Jeremiah's doing what I ask him to do, so maybe I can give him something more to do." Then he looks down and he sees one of his servants that he's given something to do and he's not doing anything with it. In fact, he's hoarding it. He's holding it to himself. We're going to see in a few moments that God has a reaction to that as well. God says, "Well done, now good and faithful servant.
[time=1182] Thou has been faithful over a few things. I'll make you ruler over many." Then thirdly, there's an invitation, a commendation, a promotion, and now an invitation. Enter thou
[time=1193] into the joy of thy Lord. What is involved here men and women is this. This passage of Scripture teaches that when we're faithful to the Lord in stewardship, we are promoted from servanthood to friendship. This banquet which is referenced here is a banquet that
[time=1209] the Master holds for his intimate friends. It is a festive occasion in the Oriental culture
[time=1215] and it teaches us that when we're faithful to the Lord, we enter into the intimate circle of his joy and that's why the New Testament teaches us that we're no longer servants, now we're friends. I want to be a friend. I'm glad to be a servant, but I want to be a friend. You know how you become a friend? You become a friend when you enter into the circle of faithful stewardship and obedience to the Lord and you become a part of that inner circle of joy. A commendation, a promotion, and an invitation. Now notice, fourthly, the
[time=1245] reward of the evil. Fifthly, the reward of the evil steward. I want you to notice why
[time=1251] this evil steward was an evil steward. I never saw this quite in the same light before, but it's very interesting if you can't get away from it, it's right in the text. We're told that in verse 24 that when the one talent man came, he said, "Lord, I knew thee, the
[time=1266] thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, gathering where thou hast not spread,"
[time=1272] and here it is, verse 25, "I was afraid." It's suddenly dawned on me that the reason
[time=1278] more of God's people don't do what God wants them to do is because they're afraid. In these
[time=1284] next days is the economic situation heats up and we have all of these ramifications around us. You know what's going to happen? Some of God's people are going to be afraid to keep on giving to the Lord, and they're going to say, "Well, I better start sticking that in a bank and setting it aside, because if I don't, when the evil times come, I won't have what I need." This man had the same exact approach. He thought that when his master came
[time=1307] back that he might not have what he needed and that he would not be able to get back what he'd invested. He felt like it if he attempted to invest his money for his master and he didn't make what he should make, that his master would be rough with him. There were two things wrong with him. Number one, he did not trust the person of his master.
[time=1327] He thought he was a hard man. There are a lot of folks that treat the Lord that way. I'd
[time=1333] like to give to God, but how do I know that I'm going to have what I need? You know that because God promises you that. God promises you in many places over and over again in the Scripture that when you're faithful to the task, he will care for your needs. God's commandments are his enablements. God's will and direction will never lead you where his
[time=1352] grace cannot sustain you. And so if we have in our minds the idea that we have a hard
[time=1358] master, you see we're wrong at that point. That's an unfounded fear. He was not only afraid of his master's person, he was afraid of his master's provision. For we read here that he places his master in the same category as the Old Testament placed the Egyptian monarchs.
[time=1375] Do you remember the Egyptian monarchs during the days of Israel and Egypt? They said, "I want you to make these bricks, and it's no longer enough just to make the bricks go get the straw and gather the straw." He had the attitude about his master that his master would not enable him to do what he'd ask him to do. Now I'm not making financial promises
[time=1394] to our people today, but I am telling you this on the authority of the Word of God. If you can do what God calls you to do and give what God tells you to give in faithful stewardship
[time=1405] and he doesn't provide for your needs, then this book doesn't mean what it says. Because this book tells us that if we're faithful, God will meet our needs. And there are men and women in this congregation who could stand right now at this occasion and give testimony to the fact that when they got involved in faithful stewardship to the Lord, doing what was honest before God in their giving on a regular basis, at that point in time God began to undertake and care for their needs. I personally believe with all of my heart
[time=1435] that God will meet the needs of those who are faithful to his task. The steward was reprimanded
[time=1442] for his fear. What was the result of his failure? Well, the Bible says he was convicted. God
[time=1450] called him or the master called him a wicked and slothful servant. That's pretty strong language. That's awful strong language. When he stood before his master and he gave him
[time=1461] back the one talent that had been entrusted to him, the master looked him right in the eye and he said, "You're a wicked and lazy steward." I personally believe there are going
[time=1470] to be some folks that have that word said to them when they stand before their master sometime in heaven. And when God looks at the lifetime audit and sees what they've done
[time=1481] with what he's entrusted to their care, in terms of the kingdom, in terms of the Lord's work, not only in money, but in terms of talent and abilities and life, and God looks
[time=1492] at that and how little of it's been invested for eternity, he's going to look at us and say, "Thou wicked and slothful servant." Do you know there are two things you can hear from God? You can either hear well done, "Thou good and faithful servant," or you can hear "Thou wicked and slothful servant." It doesn't take any one much rationality to determine
[time=1511] which they'd rather hear, but you see the difference is not what happens there but what happens between now and then. God has given to you and to me certain things to invest
[time=1522] for his kingdom. What are we doing with it? I read recently the story of a man who was a violin collector. Over the years he had collected over a hundred different violins from all over the world. He wasn't a wealthy man, but he had carefully kept his money and invested it and he was able to buy violins. When the old man died, they went to his house
[time=1543] to recover his treasure and they found all of these violins, every place in the house.
[time=1548] Up in the attic in a dresser drawer of an old dresser, they pulled out a violin that had the look of antiquity upon it and they took it to a man who assessed its value and
[time=1558] discovered it was a stratovarius. A collector came and bought the violin, paid a great price
[time=1565] for it, and then did a history on it, tracing it back to its origin. He discovered that that violin had been purchased before this collector, by another collector, and that
[time=1576] for a hundred and forty-seven years the voice of that violin had never been heard. He took
[time=1582] that violin and he made it available to an outstanding violinist in his area for the
[time=1588] express purpose of re-establishing the purpose for which the violin was created. I read that
[time=1595] story, I was reminded of the fact that God has in his wonderful sovereignty endowed all of us with a beautiful purpose and opportunity to serve him. There are many like that violin
[time=1606] who have been put on a shelf back in the closet someplace, they don't give as God wants them to give, they don't serve as God wants them to serve, they're not involved in caring for the ministry, they come and sit and soak and sour every Sunday, they don't ever do anything for the Lord, and they don't accomplish the purpose for which God created them, and the
[time=1626] result of that is their life really doesn't focus in on the ultimate plan God had when
[time=1634] they were created. Men and women's stewardship is being before God, that for which He created
[time=1641] us. Are you willing to be that? Are you willing to come to grips with it today? Let's pray
[time=1647] together. Father in heaven, this is a very, very pointed passage. It is not hard for us
[time=1662] to understand it, it's self-interpreting, we can just read it and know what it means.
[time=1667] As we've applied it to our own lives today, we would pray that you would help us to acknowledge, first of all, the lordship of the Savior, help us to recognize that we have nothing that is our own. Oh God, I pray that you will help us to understand that all we have is just a
[time=1682] gift from God entrusted to us while He is in the far country, and one day He's coming back again and will give an account of our stewardship. May we take those things which have been given to us to dispense for His Kingdom and be faithful in the use of them.
[time=1698] Our Father, we pray for those who may be in this service today, who are not a part of the family of God, who have not even begun to realize the purpose for which they were created because
[time=1709] they're running their own life, and the Lord Jesus is not.
