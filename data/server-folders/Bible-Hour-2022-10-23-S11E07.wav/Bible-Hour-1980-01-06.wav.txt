[time=0] [APPLAUSE]
[time=3] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerima.
[time=13] [APPLAUSE]
[time=15] Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=24] We welcome our friends who have joined us now by television to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the second morning service.
[time=36] The opportunity that God has given to us to share with you at home the ministry of music and the Word of God.
[time=43] A few moments we're going to begin a series of messages on the New Testament book of Colossians.
[time=49] So those of you who are sharing our service at home need to have your Bibles ready so you can study with us.
[time=54] We'll be opening the Word of God together in just a few moments.
[time=58] Right now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=62] [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=211] Thank you, choir.
[time=218] We have all appreciated in the past the ministry of Al and Lenna Peterson as they have sung for us a beautiful duet that have graced our services so many times.
[time=227] And once in a while, Lenna would have a solo and demonstrate the great gift that God has given to her in music.
[time=234] She's going to sing by herself today, a song that recalls the day that she met Jesus.
[time=240] It's a beautiful song, and I know that it'll encourage your heart as you listen.
[time=245] [MUSIC - 142 seconds]
[time=391] We're so glad that you're joining us today on the Bible
[time=409] Hour, and I'm especially thankful that you're able to be with us for this first telecast in a series of new messages on the New Testament book of Colossians.
[time=418] In just a moment, we'll be turning to that New Testament book and begin our study in a great book written by the apostle Paul, which has some very pertinent information for today.
[time=428] During these past days, we've continued to receive mail from people that are being helped and encouraged by the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=435] I have to admit that when we weigh the responsibility and cost of the program, the only thing that makes it worth while are those letters that we receive from people who tell us that the Bible Hour television program is meeting a need in their life, encouraging, strengthening, and helping them.
[time=452] And yes, even a few times, each week, we hear from folks who have trusted Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=458] And that really does make it worthwhile.
[time=461] One of the things that we try to do through the Bible Hour television program is to extend our ministry beyond just the hour that we have together on Sunday.
[time=470] We do that in various ways, but one of the most important ways is by sharing with you items of literature which will help you study the Bible on your own.
[time=480] One of the most helpful pieces of literature that we've ever put together is a little booklet called the Answer Book.
[time=486] I had a fresh experience of the value of that book just the other day.
[time=490] In fact, it was on Christmas Day.
[time=492] I got a call from the wife of one of our deacons telling us that her husband's mother was near dying at the hospital.
[time=501] By the time I got there, I walked into the room just as she had passed out of this life and gone to be with her Lord.
[time=507] As we were talking together in the family room, her son, Neil, told me that the words of the scripture contained in the Answer Book had been a great encouragement to him and to his father during these times.
[time=519] They had focused in especially on those passages of scripture that have to do with comfort.
[time=523] They had talked together about what God has to say to those who are going through some deep troubled times.
[time=530] And I know that what has happened in the life of Neil happens in the lives of many people who have this little Bible study tool with them.
[time=538] It is simply a small booklet which contains verses of scripture which are topically arranged so that when you need a passage of scripture on a certain particular subject, you can open the book and find not just the reference but the entire verse written out.
[time=553] Some folks I know are going through the book and memorizing some of the passages on the different pages.
[time=559] We'd like for you to have your own special copy of the Answer Book.
[time=563] We'd be happy to send it to you this week free and postage paid if you will just write to us and request it.
[time=568] When you write, you need to write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and ask for the Answer Book.
[time=578] Along with the Answer Book, we extend the Bible Hours ministry into the homes of our friends through a daily devotional Bible study guide called The Daily Walk.
[time=587] We have just started the new year of studies in The Daily Walk and those of you who began with us in January are well on your way to reading through the entire Bible in 1980.
[time=598] The uniqueness of this program is that you can start at any place you want to.
[time=602] You can start in February or April and just stay in the program for an entire year and you will have read through the scriptures.
[time=609] If you've always had the desire to read the Bible through in a year, somehow you've never really gotten it accomplished.
[time=616] Let me encourage you to write to us this week and request your first free copy of The Daily Walk.
[time=622] It'll provide a chart that you can follow to get you through the scriptures in one year by reading the Bible for 15 to 20 minutes each day.
[time=630] Each day there is an assignment of scripture, a commentary of a brief nature on the passage that's being read, an application of that passage to your own heart, and some helps that will get you an understanding of the word along with the accomplishment of reading it.
[time=646] The Daily Walk is available to all of our many Bible hour friends simply by writing to us and requesting your first free copy.
[time=653] When we send you the first copy, we'll let you know how you can receive it each and every month through the entire year.
[time=659] I hope that you'll sit down today and write to me asking for your free copy of The Daily Walk.
[time=665] Once again, when you write, make sure that you write to me Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=674] Now today, we honor a sponsor who's making possible the Bible hour telecast in this area.
[time=681] And that sponsor has requested that their name not be used on the air, but they know the date and they know that they've sponsored the program today.
[time=689] And so to that unnamed sponsor, we say thank you and God bless you for helping us get the gospel out on this particular Sunday.
[time=697] The sponsor's program is a way that we allow people to share in the ministry of the Bible hour by underwriting the cost of one television station on a particular Sunday or through the associate sponsorship program by giving $100 toward the cost of a television program on a particular Sunday.
[time=714] Sometimes it's done in honor of a person, sometimes just in the name of the sponsor.
[time=719] If you'd be interested in knowing more about the sponsor's program, you can write to us and we'll be happy to send you information.
[time=725] Now in just a few moments, I'm going to be opening the Bible to the New Testament and studying with you the book of Colossians, and this very first message is crucial for it unfolds.
[time=736] The introduction helps us to get a grasp of why the book was written and what it's all about, how pertinent it is to us today.
[time=743] So I hope you'll have your Bibles ready and join with us as we study the word in just a few moments.
[time=748] Before we go back, however, to the service, let me remind you once again that the address that you need to keep in mind for the answer book, the daily walk, information on the sponsor's program or any other items that we can be of help to you with is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=769] We hope you'll write to us this week.
[time=770] We'll be looking forward to hearing from you in the mail.
[time=773] (upbeat music)
[time=791] (singing in foreign language) - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=819] David and Peg Miller come now and remind us that Jesus must be Lord of every part of our lives.
[time=825] (upbeat music)
[time=849] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=1020] (soft music) - Thank you, David and Peggy.
[time=1030] You cannot know until we get to the word of God this morning how very appropriate that song is to remind us of the fullness of Christ in our lives.
[time=1039] Just a moment we're gonna hear before the message from Mr. Ron Hackett who is going to sing what we just got done singing a few moments ago, all for a thousand tongues to sing.
[time=1048] See, comes let me just say a word of encouragement to a pastor friend of mine who is recuperating from illness at the Lutheran Hospital.
[time=1056] Oftentimes no one remembers the preachers when they're without a pastor and so I send greetings to my friend and trust that this will be a great encouragement to his life even today, this service.
[time=1067] Ron, bless you as you sing.
[time=1068] [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=1279] - A thousand tongues to praise the Lord in that vein would certainly be a great choir, wouldn't it?
[time=1285] Someone has said that the problem isn't that we don't have a thousand tongues but that we don't use the one we have to praise the Lord enough.
[time=1292] Thank you, Ron, for praising God with the voice that God has given you.
[time=1297] Well, today we start a new study and I hope that you brought your Bibles because it's pretty hard to study without a textbook.
[time=1306] And our textbook for these next days is going to be the Book of Colossians in the New Testament.
[time=1311] And I would invite you to turn with me to the Book of Colossians.
[time=1315] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=1319] Colossians, a great book and a book for this hour.
[time=1323] And we're going to begin today with our introductory study and we'll be spending the mornings during these next Sundays studying this book together.
[time=1333] I trust that God will cause it to live within your heart as we unfold its truth and expose its meaning.
[time=1342] In order for us to begin by studying the book in a survey manner, I'm going to ask that we read two verses of Scripture together out loud this morning verses 19 of chapter 1 and verse 9 of chapter 2.
[time=1361] So if you have to turn the page to get from one to the other, be ready to do it.
[time=1365] We're going to read them back to back.
[time=1367] Chapter 1, verse 19 and chapter 2, verse 9.
[time=1372] And let's begin reading with Colossians chapter 1, verse 19.
[time=1376] Let's read out loud together.
[time=1379] For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[time=1386] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[time=1393] And now let us pray.
[time=1396] Father in heaven we thank thee for the great truth of this book, the preeminence of the Lord Jesus Christ, not only in our world, but in our lives.
[time=1409] As we study together the theme of this book, as we see it in all of its nuances, as we examine it in placing it against where we are spiritually in our walk with thee.
[time=1422] God we ask that you will make this truth live within us.
[time=1426] We're not interested in just an intellectual endeavor.
[time=1429] We want the Word of God to make a difference in our lives.
[time=1433] We want to come away from our study today with a new and deeper commitment to Christ to serve Him in the days that are before us this week.
[time=1441] So we commend Father the Word of God unto these people.
[time=1445] We commit our words and our lips unto the safe keeping of the Spirit of God who will guide and direct our words today.
[time=1452] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1457] Nestled down in the Lycus Valley are three little cities.
[time=1462] This is why today's standards but not little by the standards of the day when the Scriptures were written.
[time=1469] They probably were known as the Triple Cities.
[time=1472] There were three Hieropolis and Laodicea, which you probably remember as the city of the Book of Revelations, which the Lord spoke of when He said it was neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm and therefore He would spew them out of His mouth.
[time=1488] The city of Hieropolis and the city of Laodicea and the third being a little city called Colossae.
[time=1496] It is from this city that the Book of Colossians gets its name.
[time=1502] The Book of Colossians was written to the people who were a part of the church at Colossae, and so they were called Colossians.
[time=1510] Just as the Book of Ephesians was written to the people of the church in Ephesus, and so they were called the Ephesians or the book is called Ephesians.
[time=1520] The church at Colossae has a very interesting background.
[time=1525] It is one of the few churches to which Paul addresses a letter that he had never visited and had no direct part in starting.
[time=1534] In fact, if you will notice in your Bibles in chapter 2 and verse 1, Paul mentions that he had not at any time seen their face or they had not seen his face in the flesh.
[time=1544] How is it then that Paul the Apostle would pick up pin and write a letter to a church that he had never visited and to people who had never seen his face?
[time=1553] Well, the story is an interesting one.
[time=1556] The Book of Acts tells us that Paul the Apostle spent two years in Ephesus in teaching the Word of God.
[time=1564] And according to Acts chapter 19 and verse 10, the Scripture tells us that while Paul was teaching in the city of Ephesus, all that were in Asia heard the Word of the Lord.
[time=1576] And of course, that would include a little city 100 miles away from Ephesus by the name of Colossae.
[time=1584] During the time that Paul was teaching in Ephesus, there was a young man who sat under his tutelage by the name of Epaphras.
[time=1592] Epaphras was living in Ephesus and he was studying with the Apostle Paul, although he was a native of the city of Colossae.
[time=1601] As Paul would teach from day to day, and as he would follow no doubt, Paul around in his rounds as he taught publicly and privately from house to house, young Epaphras got excited and he got infected with the call to the Gospel ministry.
[time=1617] He saw the impact of the Word of God on the lives of the people of Ephesus, and immediately he began to have a burden for the place where he lived back in Colossae.
[time=1627] And so little by little as the infection spread from within his spirit to preach the Word of God, it got to the place where he couldn't contain it any longer, and he came to Paul one day and he said, Paul, I've enjoyed my study with you, but I've got to leave now.
[time=1644] It's time for me to go back to my hometown and begin to do there what you've been doing here.
[time=1650] And so Epaphras went the 100 miles from Ephesus to Colossae, and he began the church, which was the church at Colossae.
[time=1660] Now another interesting fact is added to that as you read on through the New Testament and get to the book of Philemon.
[time=1666] Philemon was a very prominent citizen in the city of Colossae, and according to the first and second verses of that book, it was in Philemon's house that the church of Colossae was started.
[time=1679] And so here we have the picture and the setting of this book.
[time=1684] Paul the Apostle had preached.
[time=1687] Epaphras had gotten excited about the ministry.
[time=1689] He had gone to Colossae to start a work.
[time=1692] The work started in the house of a businessman, of a young, bright and intelligent and leadership quality person by the name of Philemon, and now the church is flourishing in the city of Colossae.
[time=1705] Unfortunately for Epaphras, he had not had an opportunity to go on for graduate study.
[time=1711] He had studied under Paul for just a short time.
[time=1714] He had enough under his belt to go out and communicate with others, but he hadn't gone into those other courses in theology that would help him to know what to do when problems arose.
[time=1724] He hadn't been pastoring in Colossae very long before some of those problems did arise, and he frankly didn't know what to do with him.
[time=1731] So he asked his board for a few days' leave of absence,
[time=1737] and he went back to Ephesus, or he went to Rome to see Paul.
[time=1742] In the meantime, Paul had left Ephesus and he had gone to Rome, and he was in his first imprisonment.
[time=1747] He was imprisoned in Rome.
[time=1750] Young Epaphras, this growing and developing minister, went to the prison in Rome where Paul was, and he began to tell him the story of what was happening in Colossae.
[time=1760] And this is the story that he told him.
[time=1762] He said, "Paul, I was just getting started in the ministry there, and things were beginning to happen.
[time=1767] People were coming to Christ, and believers were being built up in the faith." When all of a sudden, there began to develop within our congregation some differing opinions about how a person is justified before God.
[time=1780] Basically, the inroads into the Church of Colossae were three.
[time=1784] As young Epaphras unfolded, these problems to Paul, who was imprisoned in Rome, Paul formulated in his mind an answer to those problems, and instead of telling Epaphras all of the answers and asking him to go back and remember it all, he wrote those answers down in this book, which is called Colossians.
[time=1803] And this book then is the answer that Paul gave to Epaphras about the problems that had developed within the Church of Colossae.
[time=1812] Now, I'm not interested in just researching history to discern what Paul thought about some historical problems.
[time=1819] But you see, the Bible isn't a book like that.
[time=1822] We wouldn't have the book of Colossians if it weren't true that the problems they faced in Colossae are problems which churches throughout history have felt in every different generation.
[time=1833] Basically, the problems were threefold.
[time=1836] And we're going to take just a moment and look at some of the things that Paul said in answer to these problems by way of introduction today.
[time=1844] The first thing that began to make its way into the Church and make its influence felt in that early Church, meeting in Philemon's house, was a Judiistic legalism.
[time=1856] There were some Jews who had come to understand the Gospel of Christ and had come to know the Lord, and they were a part of that early assembly.
[time=1866] But they had not sufficiently left the traditions and rituals of their Judiistic past behind them, and some of their leaders began to teach that it was important not only to know Christ as your personal Savior, but also that you must observe certain days and eat at certain feasts and celebrate certain Jewish traditions, and that if you did not, you were not truly born again.
[time=1892] And so this heresy began to creep into the Church, not unlike that which Paul dealt with in the book of Galatians.
[time=1899] Paul would say to those Judiistic legalists as he writes back to the Church in Colossae, the words of chapter 2 and verse 8.
[time=1909] He would say, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." He would say it is not important that you add the feasts and the holidays and all the rest of it.
[time=1927] The important thing is that Christ is the central part of your lives and Christ is all there is to salvation, plus or minus nothing.
[time=1935] Along with the Judiistic legalists entered into that Church another kind of person that we would call Greek philosophers.
[time=1944] They delved into speculation.
[time=1947] They had so organized the world, these Greek philosophers, that they had developed a special place for Christ in the scheme of things.
[time=1958] According to the Greek traditional philosophy, there was a scheme called the Pleroma with God at the top and an emanation of angels and created beings of which Jesus Christ was one in number.
[time=1972] According to the Greek philosophers, God the Father was here and then there were a series of angels and somewhere down toward the bottom of that emanation was Jesus Christ.
[time=1982] He was not divine, he was not God in the flesh, he was just one of the ways that a man approaches God.
[time=1991] And so the Greek philosophers were saying that it's all right to believe in Christ as a person, but just remember that he is really just one of many approaches to God through this Pleroma, this scheme of things.
[time=2006] And Paul would say to them in the words of the verses which we read aloud this morning, and may I read it inserting a Greek word so that you will understand what he was saying.
[time=2016] In chapter one verse 19, "For it pleased the Father that in him should all the Pleroma dwell." What was he saying?
[time=2026] He was saying Jesus Christ isn't a part of the scheme of getting to God, he is the scheme, he is the only way.
[time=2034] And in chapter two verse nine we would read, "For in him dwelleth all the Pleroma of the Godhead." In other words, Paul was saying to these people, Jesus Christ is all and in all, he is not one among many approaches, he is the approach, for there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.
[time=2056] Added to the Judastic Legalists and the Greek philosophers were those who were delving into the realms of Spiritism.
[time=2065] Paul could not have known what kind of day we would face today when these words were written, but there were in that early assembly of believers, some who had crept into delve into things which men ought not to even traffic with, worshiping of angels, worshiping of unseen spirits, and all of the roots of modern day Spiritism were present in the early church at Colossae, and Paul would speak to those who would bring these foreign things into the church and into the gospel of Jesus Christ and he would say to them in chapter two and verse 18, "Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which you have not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind." Paul's words are alive and well today for all who would add to the Christian gospel, to be playing around in realms that do not belong to the doctrine of Christ as it is recorded in the Word of God.
[time=2129] It blows my mind, if I could use the vernacular of today, to see how many Christians are involved in astrology, how many Christians play around with the Spiritism of our day as if it were some sort of side light, as if to say that Christ is the main thing, but these things are all right too, and Paul says no.
[time=2147] Paul says not to be trafficking in that which is not a part of the true biblical doctrine of Jesus Christ.
[time=2155] Now these philosophies and these foreign elements which had crept into the church, Epiphras came and said to Paul, "I don't know what to do with these." It would be like a first year pastor running into all of these kind of heavy problems and really never having faced them before.
[time=2171] The first thing that would come to his mind would be to go back to his teacher and see if he could get some more information.
[time=2176] And so Paul set down this book to help him with his church and to help them understand what was involved in meeting the need of his day.
[time=2186] Now this whole philosophy and speculation and legalism
[time=2192] kind of was amalgamated together to form one kind of doctrine which has grown up throughout the years in history, and I'm not trying to be intellectual or even try to give the impression of being heavy today, but I want you to understand where this book came from.
[time=2207] That doctrine came to be known as the doctrine of Gnosticism.
[time=2211] It was a combination of Judaism and Greek philosophy and Spiritism and mysticism sort of put together and it became a cult in its day.
[time=2221] And there are many who have grown out of Gnosticism today who are alive and well and operating in our world.
[time=2228] Basically Gnosticism taught some basic considerations that destroyed the purity of the doctrine of Christ.
[time=2236] Here are some of the things the Gnostics believed.
[time=2238] They believed that material things were evil and spiritual things were good.
[time=2247] And so the body was evil, it was the spirit that was good.
[time=2251] You can understand why they had a tremendous problem with the humanity of Christ because his humanity involved his body and they considered the body to be evil.
[time=2260] They could accept the deity of Christ but they could not accept the humanity of Christ.
[time=2264] The Gnostics believed that only the spiritual was good and that both material and spiritual things were eternal.
[time=2270] The outgrowth of that were the following.
[time=2273] Number one, they would spiritualize Christ and deny his humanity.
[time=2278] They would consider Christ to be a spirit being but they did not accept the humanity of Christ.
[time=2283] It's interesting that Paul went right to the very core of that problem even in the words that he used to address the Colossian believers.
[time=2291] Notice chapter one in verse 22.
[time=2294] He said that Jesus Christ died in a certain way.
[time=2297] Notice in the body of his flesh through death.
[time=2302] Now it wasn't necessary for Paul to go to all of that detail if there had not been a problem in that regard.
[time=2308] But he said to those Colossian believers Christ died not in the spirit but he died how in the body of his flesh.
[time=2318] Notice chapter two in verse nine.
[time=2321] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead.
[time=2325] But he didn't stop there.
[time=2327] He used the word bodily.
[time=2329] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead.
[time=2333] But bodily why did he say that because there were people back in that church who believed that Christ did not have a body because that would involve him in that which is evil.
[time=2343] And Paul said to the Colossians that Jesus Christ embodied the Godhead in his flesh, in his body.
[time=2354] Now when these people called the Gnostics began to believe that the body was evil and the spirit was good there were certain things that started to happen in the way they celebrated their Christianity.
[time=2366] Since the body was evil and the spirit was good they had two choices as it related to the body.
[time=2372] The first choice was what we might call sort of a rigid asceticism which constantly abused the body.
[time=2379] Put it down, starve it, cause it to function according to certain categorical feasts
[time=2386] and certain categorical foods and deny it the things that it needs and constantly put the body down.
[time=2394] The ascetics who grew up in that church believed that if you could put the body down you would free the spirit from its prison.
[time=2401] And so Paul would write to these ascetics in chapter 2 verses 20 and 23
[time=2409] wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances?
[time=2416] Touch not, taste not, handle not which are all to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men.
[time=2424] What is he saying?
[time=2425] He's saying all of this asceticism, touch not, taste not, handle not.
[time=2429] That isn't really where it's at because the body is not unimportant in the mind of God.
[time=2436] The second approach that the Gnostics had toward the body was not asceticism but total licentiousness.
[time=2443] Or if the body isn't important, if it's evil then I might as well just enjoy it completely.
[time=2448] Their concept was that very, very concept which we know is hedonism today which says if it feels good do it.
[time=2455] If the body has an appetite for it it must be alright.
[time=2458] And so there were some in the church at Colossae who reasoned this way.
[time=2461] We believe, said they, that the spirit is good and the body is evil.
[time=2466] Since the body is evil nothing good can come from it anyway.
[time=2469] So we might as well just let it run its course and satisfy its appetites and do whatever it pleases.
[time=2475] And so within the church on the one hand were those who were punishing the body and on the other hand were those who were just living the body as if it were of no consequence.
[time=2485] And Paul would write to those who were living in sin in the third chapter beginning at verse 5, mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth.
[time=2496] Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, etcetera, etcetera.
[time=2502] Mortify means to put to death.
[time=2504] Paul said, no that's not an acceptable way to live as a Christian.
[time=2508] Thinking that your body is unimportant and then fulfilling every lust of the flesh.
[time=2512] Put to death this in your life and in your flesh.
[time=2517] No wonder Paul had to write so plainly because of the inroads of that kind of thing within the church.
[time=2524] Men and women it's alive and well in churches today.
[time=2528] In our world as I mentioned last week we have been so desensitized by sin that there are many today who believe that the spirit is over here and we take care of that with our Christianity.
[time=2539] And the body is over here and whatever we feel like doing is okay and never the twain shall meet.
[time=2545] God would say to us through his word today that the spirituality of the spirit affects the body and we are to be holy temples of God and the body is important.
[time=2558] So these things Paul was trying to remedy in the writing of the book of Colossians.
[time=2564] Now it is not a good thing when you're telling a story to give the conclusion before you begin
[time=2570] but I want to give the conclusion this morning.
[time=2573] Paul uses the 95 verses in the book of Colossians to explain to the Colossian believers the simplicity which is to be found in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2584] You know one of the things we are so capable of doing as Christians is making the simple things as complicated as they can be.
[time=2592] It's so hard to get people to understand the simplicity of the gospel.
[time=2595] I don't know how many people have told me pastor I'd like to believe what you believe but it's too easy.
[time=2599] It's too simple.
[time=2601] And God would tell us through Paul that he wants us to get back to the simplicity which is in Christ that Christ is all we need.
[time=2610] Now he does that in a number of ways.
[time=2613] First of all just look with me in the first chapter.
[time=2616] Notice the doctrine of Christ as it is taught just in chapter number one.
[time=2622] And I'm going to move quickly you've got your Bibles open and you can follow and if you get lost you can go back and review later.
[time=2628] Chapter one verse 20 tells us that he has made peace by the blood of his cross for us.
[time=2634] Chapter one verse 14 tells us that through his blood we have redemption.
[time=2640] Chapter one verse 14 tells us that it is in him we have forgiveness of sins.
[time=2646] Chapter one verses 20 through 22 tells us that we are reconciled in the body of his death.
[time=2653] Chapter one verse two tells us that he is our peace.
[time=2657] Chapter one verse four tells us that he is the source of our faith.
[time=2662] Chapter one verse 27 tells us that he is the believer's hope.
[time=2666] Chapter one verses 18 and 24 tells us that he is the head of the church which is his body.
[time=2672] Chapter one verse 28 tells us that one day he will perfect us to be like unto himself.
[time=2678] Just in one chapter Paul teaches us the doctrine of the shed blood of Christ
[time=2684] of redemption of forgiveness of reconciliation of believers peace of faith etc etc.
[time=2689] What is he saying? He is saying every way he can say it Christ is all you need.
[time=2695] You don't need the sacrifices you've got the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=2700] You don't need all of the rituals you've got forgiveness from God.
[time=2705] You don't need to plan a series of do goods to get to heaven for Christ is your hope of glory.
[time=2712] On and on he goes just in chapter number one.
[time=2717] It's an interesting thing to read through the book and notice how very carefully Paul dealt with the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ in the believer's life.
[time=2728] Now you have your Bibles open.
[time=2730] Let me read with you some passages and collations to illustrate what I mean.
[time=2736] You just turn with me and let me read it with my emphasis and then you go back later and figure it out and put it in your Bible.
[time=2744] I've underlined it in mind. If I could show you my Bible you'd see little blue underlining throughout the book of Colossians. But let me just highlight it for you.
[time=2753] What Paul did in order to illustrate to the Colossian believers in this letter was to point out the fullness and completeness of Jesus Christ for life and practice.
[time=2764] And he did it by using two words. One is the word full or fullness and the other is the word all.
[time=2771] And I think you'll understand what I mean as I read through the book just very quickly in some verses that I will point out beginning in chapter one verse nine.
[time=2780] For this cause we also sense the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that she might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom.
[time=2792] Verse 10, walk worthy unto the Lord in all pleasing.
[time=2797] Verse 11, strengthen with all might unto all patience.
[time=2802] Verse 16, for by him were all things created.
[time=2806] All things were created by him and for him.
[time=2809] Verse 17, and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
[time=2816] Verse 18, that in all things he might have the preeminence.
[time=2820] Verse 19, for it pleased the Father that in him should dwell all fullness.
[time=2825] Verse 20, reconciling all things unto himself.
[time=2830] Chapter 2, verse 2, and unto all riches of full assurance.
[time=2835] Chapter 3, in whom are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[time=2839] Chapter 2, verse 9, "In him dwelleth all fullness of the Godhead, and ye are complete in him who is the head of all principality and power, and has forgiven you." Verse 13, all trespasses.
[time=2851] Verse 19, "And not holding the head from whom all the body and joints and bands having nourishment ministered." Chapter 3, verse 16, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom."
[time=2864] Verse 17, "Whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord.
[time=2869] Children obey your parents in all things." Verse 20, verse 22, "Servants obey in all things.
[time=2875] And as if to sum it up in one verse, a verse which has a phrase in it, we ought never to forget." He tells us in chapter 3, verse 11, at the end of the verse, "But Christ is all and in all."
[time=2889] Now do you see what Paul's trying to say?
[time=2891] He's saying to these Colossian believers, you don't need that other stuff.
[time=2896] Now I'm sure he didn't say it that bluntly.
[time=2899] But he is saying you need to major on the person of Jesus Christ, for he is all and he is in all and it is a reality that which we're saying Christ is all you need.
[time=2911] And all the temptation that we have today as Christians to try to add something to it.
[time=2918] I have friends who are so caught up in success motivation that Christ has gotten buried in book 1.
[time=2927] And I think there are many good things we can learn from the truths of success motivation.
[time=2932] Understandably so, most of the truth, if you unravel it, comes from the Word of God anyway. All truth is God's truth.
[time=2940] But what a temptation there is for us as Christians to leave the doctrine of Christ in our love affair with him and get caught up in all of the other things which can creep into our lives to divert us from the simplicity and the purity which is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2958] So that he is not Lord of all, he's just part of our life.
[time=2963] And the whole purpose of the book of Colossians is in order that Paul might say to us,
[time=2969] Christ is all you need. He is sufficient for all things.
[time=2975] And let him be your sufficiency in your life.
[time=2979] So then this book which has only 95 verses and which can be easily read in 8 to 10 minutes is a book which has basically four functions for us as Christians.
[time=2990] First of all, to declare to us the doctrine of Jesus Christ.
[time=2994] It is a biblical Christology.
[time=2998] May I say to you this morning that with the rampant growth of cults that are developing in our world, in our community, that Christians need to be prepared with a biblical doctrine of Christ for that is the crux of cultism.
[time=3014] If you ask a cultist what think ye of Jesus Christ, you will get to the core of his teaching. If he says I believe that the Jesus of the new is not the Jehovah of the old, you've got a problem. If he denies the deity of Christ or the humanity of Christ, you've got a problem.
[time=3034] It isn't what they think about the church or what necessarily they even think about the Word of God. You go for their juggler vein. What think ye of Christ?
[time=3042] Men and women, you better know what you think of him.
[time=3046] They tell me that in the FBI, when they're teaching the agents to learn how to discern bogus bills, they spend not five minutes examining bogus bills, but they spend all of their time examining the real thing so that they are so knowledgeable of the real thing that when the bogus appears, it's evident.
[time=3066] One of the reasons why so many of God's people are getting sucked into cults today is because we have developed a culture and generation of biblical illiterates. We don't know enough about what we believe that we can spot the phony when it walks in the door.
[time=3082] And Paul would say to the Colossian believers, no Christ.
[time=3086] Understand Christ. Make him all and in all in your life and when you do, you will see when the air comes.
[time=3094] So we need a biblical doctrine of Christ. Secondly, this book destroys the unsaved persons excuses.
[time=3102] That's one of the reasons why I'm excited about preaching from Colossians. Because God gives us an opportunity through television and here in our auditorium to touch the lives of many people who don't know Christ. Do you know nobody ever rejects Jesus Christ strictly for intellectual reasons? The man who continues to reject Christ has a pet sin somewhere and he is just in love with his sin so much that he rejects Christ from moral grounds, not on intellectual grounds. He throws up a philosophical or intellectual smokescreen and he hides behind it.
[time=3134] Someone has said that when we fall in love with our sin, we can manufacture 10,000 syllogisms to keep us from the cross. That's true. And the genius of the book of Colossians is that it destroys the smokescreens. It deals with the intellectual things that men hide behind it just destroys them so that the man is left out there naked in his sin and God can begin to deal with him. And that's one of the benefits of this great book.
[time=3162] It destroys the excuses that men use for not coming to know Christ.
[time=3166] Thirdly, I want you to be excited about this book not only because it declares the biblical doctrine of Christ and destroys the excuses men have for not accepting Christ, but this book deals with the problem of heresy. I read this week that the church of today is haunted by the ghosts of dead heresies.
[time=3186] We are. Do you know there's nothing new under the sun? What we're talking about in terms of Gnosticism has just been recreated. Today we call it spiritism, Theosophy, legalism, rationalism. Many of the new Eastern mystic cults which have made inroads into our church are just a recreation of the old Gnostic heresy which grew up in the church at Colossae.
[time=3214] Paul tells us how to deal with it and it's great to have the handbook in it.
[time=3218] We just need to know what it says. Last but not least, this book defines the role of the Christian.
[time=3226] I told you last week that Paul starts with doctrine and he ends with duty.
[time=3230] Men and women, when you have Christ in the right perspective in your life, it'll change you. It'll make you different. If Christ is all and in all to you, it will affect your personal life.
[time=3242] It will affect your business life. It will affect your social life.
[time=3246] It will affect your family life and it will affect your church life.
[time=3250] If Christ is all and in all in your life, it will touch you everywhere you live. And that's why this is such a great book for us to study because Paul helps us to apply that truth to today and tomorrow as we walk among the people.
[time=3266] Someone has written that there are only three kinds of people in the world.
[time=3274] And if that's a true statement, that includes all of us here, doesn't it?
[time=3278] He said there are some people, many people, to whom Christ is nothing at all.
[time=3286] There are some people, to whom Christ is something.
[time=3292] And there are very few people to whom Christ is everything.
[time=3296] There are lots of folks to whom Christ is nothing at all.
[time=3300] We see them, we run with them, we rub shoulders with them every week.
[time=3304] They take his name in vain, he is nothing.
[time=3308] Just something to curse people with.
[time=3312] Then there are some in many of whom are Christians, to whom Christ is something.
[time=3316] He's convenient. We install him on Sundays.
[time=3320] Then we dethrone him on Monday morning. He is something.
[time=3324] But oh, there are a few. God helped them to grow and develop and multiply to whom Christ is everything.
[time=3332] And Paul would say to us today, in this book, Christ must be all and in all. He alone is sufficient to meet the need of a man's life.
[time=3344] Shall we pray?
[time=3348] Father in Heaven, the Word of God so convicts our hearts.
[time=3356] It is so easy for all of us, if we're honest, to install Christ so that He is something in our lives without being everything.
[time=3364] Forgive us for that sin.
[time=3368] Help us today to reevaluate our place and His place within us.
[time=3372] Lord, perhaps there are some here today.
[time=3376] Some who hear my voice, to whom Christ is nothing at all.
[time=3380] Nothing in terms of their commitment to him.
[time=3384] They have not availed themselves of his forgiveness, of his love, of his acceptance.
[time=3392] Father, today I pray that this will be a day when he becomes not nothing at all but everything in their lives.
