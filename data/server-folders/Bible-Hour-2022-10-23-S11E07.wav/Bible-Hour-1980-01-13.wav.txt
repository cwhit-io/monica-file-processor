[time=16] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerremont.
[time=27] [MUSIC]
[time=54] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=57] We're grateful to welcome you to this morning's service
[time=63] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=65] This is the second hour of worship here and we're thankful for all of you who have come to join with us.
[time=71] For those of you who are visiting with us here in the auditorium and for our many friends who have joined us by way of television, we trust that the service today will be an encouragement and blessing to you that will be caused of God to challenge and encourage and build up your life and if you have not come to know Christ in a personal way that the Word of God will bring you into a personal relationship with Him.
[time=94] We're grateful for the opportunity we have to praise God and one of the purposes for us to worship together and meet together is that we might draw near to Him and worship Him.
[time=104] Our choir is leading us in that praise today as they sing a song that has almost every one of the names of the Lord Jesus Christ in its text. The name of the song is "Praise His Holy Names" and I trust you'll listen carefully to every word.
[time=143] [MUSIC]
[time=170] He is the way, He is the truth, the life, He is the light of the world, He is the head of the church, He is the man of sorrows,
[time=181] Prince of me, He is the lion, He is the master of champion,
[time=189] Jesus, we dear and ever, and not just God. Right in morning song, morning song.
[time=204] We come all here, Lord Jesus Christ, Lord of all, His name is Jesus Christ,
[time=213] He is author and finisher of our faith, He is a word of life and God's only son,
[time=222] He is a great lion, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever,
[time=233] forever, ever, now, just in the given to you, Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=253] for we honor and majesty be given to you, Lord Jesus, given to you, Lord Jesus,

[time=288] Lord Jesus Christ, glory and honor, blessing and praise, Lord Jesus and joy, now and forever, forever, forever,
[time=311] forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,
[time=337] I told you it was a lesson in theology and music and it was indeed, and we thank God for scriptural music that glorifies and honors the Lord. Marlene Nichols is the wife of one of our
[time=348] staff members, Dr. Ken Nichols, and Ken is very visible around here because of his ministry within
[time=355] the church and counseling, but we're so grateful for his family and they are all talented people, as you will soon learn as we listen now to the ministry of Marlene as she sings for us.
[time=367] [MUSIC]
[time=380] We are bursting in hope, close to thy heart,
[time=394] drawing my save, Lord, so precious thou art,
[time=408] fold me, all fold me, close to thy breast,
[time=422] she'll turn his save, in thy day, bend the breast, she'll turn his save,
[time=443] in thy day, bend the breast,
[time=464] there is a place of quiet rest, near to the heart of God,
[time=479] a place where sin cannot molest, near to the heart of God,
[time=493] oh, Jesus blessed me deeper, said from the heart of God,
[time=507] fold us awake before thee, near to the heart of God.
[time=531] Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed, Lord, to the cross where thou hast died,
[time=547] draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed, Lord, to thy precious leading side.
[time=578] We're so very grateful that you've joined us today, and I hope that already the Bible hour has been a blessing to you in the ministry of music, and Don and I have the joy of taking
[time=588] these few moments during the offering to sit and talk with you about some things that really are more special to the Bible hour people than they are to the folks who've gathered in the auditorium.
[time=597] Today I want to take just a moment before we share some letters and some other items of information
[time=603] to let you know that if you haven't already received you will be receiving very soon a letter from my desk with an update on the current status of the Bible hour ministry.
[time=613] I know that we have talked about this before but I want to say to all of you who are watching that
[time=619] those of us in the Bible hour office are praying daily and are very concerned about the future
[time=625] ministry of this telecast. We have just committed ourselves to the fact that 1980 has to be the year of stability. In the past we've gone through some difficulties, we have had some great blessings
[time=637] and we've had some real discouragements. We have come to the realization that there are enough people
[time=643] in the Bible hour television family to make sure that this ministry is stabilized and continues
[time=649] to go forward. The letter I've written to you is all about that and I hope you'll take time to read it. I know that many of you get so many pieces of mail each day and it's easy to put one aside and not open it but when you see the letter from the Bible hour office if it hasn't already come
[time=664] I hope you'll take time to sit down and prayerfully read it and examine its contents. We need to hear
[time=670] from many of you during these days. This is a very very important time in the Bible hour ministry.
[time=676] It's a time when we need to be hearing from many folks who have yet to write to us.
[time=680] Everywhere I go Don, I meet people who say I watched the Bible hour and well I've been meeting to
[time=686] write and I just never have gotten around to it and I want you to know that this has gotten around to it week. I hope that you get around to it this week and sit down and write us a note and let us
[time=696] know that you're part of the Bible hour television ministry. Every week we receive so many letters
[time=704] from viewers telling us how much a blessing the book that the Daily Walk has been to them.
[time=710] One lady wrote this week and she said I have always wanted to read the Bible through but never sat down and started. The Daily Walk for dynamic Christian living is great
[time=722] and we would like for you to have your free copy of the Daily Walk. If you have not started reading
[time=728] the scripture through on this program it's a fantastic way to read the Bible through in one year and then one of the nice parts about the Daily Walk is that you can pick it up any month
[time=738] of the year and start through and then if you just read consecutively for one year you will finish the scriptures. If you would like to have your free copy of the Daily Walk all you need to do is write to us write to pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana just share
[time=756] with us that you would like to have your free copy of the Daily Walk and we'll be sure to get it in the mail to you. And Donna when they write we'll send them the first issue absolutely free
[time=766] and with that issue will be all the information that they need to enroll for the entire year and I was just checking in the office the other day and they told me that every day we receive several new enrollments in the Daily Walk Bible reading plan and that just encourages me immensely because it means that many more people are getting into the word each day. One of the other things that we'd like to include in the mail as we respond back to you is a little booklet that God
[time=792] has signally blessed on the Bible hour telecast. I believe he's blessed it because it's simply the scripture. It's a little book called the answer book and we've talked a lot about it over the last few weeks on the Bible hour television program but we continue to talk about it because every week we hear from many more people who have written and requested that they receive this special booklet.
[time=813] It is a booklet of scriptures which are arranged topically to answer the needs in your life. It is indeed an answer book. It has the answers to your problems and to your needs. It deals with subjects
[time=824] like discouragement and grief and sorrow and anxiety and all of the things that come into a person's
[time=831] life at one time or another and the way it deals with these problems is simply by writing out completely many of the key scriptures that touch upon those subjects. It's small enough to fit into
[time=843] your pocket or in your purse. You can carry it with you wherever you go and it is a ready reference to use whenever the need arises. We'd like for you to have that and it's absolutely free. We'll send it to you post each page when you write to us this week. If you are not receiving the daily walk just include your request for both of these in the same letter and we'll be happy to respond. Once again the address is pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne
[time=870] Indiana. Adana has some sponsors that she wants to share with you some associate sponsors I believe
[time=876] today. We have two associate sponsors this morning Rachel Habegger who is a channel 21 viewer in
[time=884] Fort Wayne and also in Fort Wayne Mr. and Mrs. Spencer Burris in memory of Opal Anson and we thank
[time=892] you folks for your willingness to share in the Bible hour ministry. Just in case you aren't
[time=898] aware of the sponsors program it is a way by which men and women who are very much interested in the Bible hour can sponsor a Bible hour television program by underwriting the cost of the airtime
[time=909] in any one given area either here in Fort Wayne or in the other areas where the Bible hour television program is seen or as an associate sponsor they can bear part of that cost and we'd like to send
[time=920] you the information about the sponsors program if you're interested just drop us a note and we'll be happy to respond. Now in just a moment we're going back to the morning service and I'm going to be speaking on a very key doctrine of the word of God one that has a rather interesting name that
[time=936] is misunderstood by a lot of folks the doctrine of reconciliation it comes from the book of Colossians
[time=942] and it's a word right out of the New Testament that has a tremendous bearing on you and your life
[time=948] right where you are now so I hope you'll be with us as we turn to the scriptures in just a few moments once again let me remind you that when you're writing for the daily walk or the answer book or requesting information about the sponsor's program you need to write to me pastor David
[time=963] Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana take our hymnals and turn in them to him number
[time=976] 184 and why don't we take our offering this morning we will sing this hymn hallelujah what a Savior shall we turn there together we'll remain seated as we say
[time=992] every voice together
[time=1022] come be true in my place and then be soon in my heart oh within one hallelujah what a Savior will be by my
[time=1048] now let me love the love of the sea oh and oh and can it be all the way up what a Savior
[time=1073] and the last together
[time=1102] and thank you for the good singing Jesus was the one who said in I if I be lifted up we'll draw all men unto me Dave Miller comes now and sings the song lift him up
[time=1127] lift him up lift him up lift the name of Jesus higher lift him up lift his banner to the sky
[time=1150] he said if I be lifted up I will draw men unto me lift him up all ye people lift him up
[time=1174] praise the Lord praise the Lord praise his righteousness forever
[time=1185] praise the Lord raise your voices to the sky
[time=1194] he said if you won't praise my name then the rocks and hills will cry out praise the Lord
[time=1211] all ye people raise the Lord
[time=1218] show his love show his love show his love to everybody
[time=1237] show his love let your candle always shine
[time=1246] he said that by the love you shall they will know where his disciples show your love all ye people
[time=1266] show your love lift him up lift him up lift him up lift his banner to the sky
[time=1294] he said if I be lifted up I will draw men unto me lift him up all ye people
[time=1312] show his love all ye people praise the Lord all ye people
[time=1332] lift him thank you David and that's certainly the purpose we have in all that we do in this
[time=1348] church is to lift up the Lord Jesus Christ while the black ox singers are preparing to sing and
[time=1354] just before the message I want to take just an opportunity to share with all of you presently here in the auditorium and especially our friends who are watching television here in the city of Fort Wayne and surrounding areas where the program is seen live that we have the wonderful privilege
[time=1370] tonight of having in our services the life-action singers and they have put together a very special
[time=1378] presentation that centers around the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ I had the opportunity this week
[time=1384] to listen to that presentation from the beginning to the end and even without all that is present
[time=1390] visually everything that I heard by way of music and narration just was a tremendous
[time=1397] challenge and blessing to my own life and though I always encourage you to be in church on Sunday night I want to take this opportunity to invite all of our friends and especially all of you who are here who are part of the ministry here to make a real effort to be here tonight at seven for the presentation of the life-action singers the glory of the cross it is something you will
[time=1417] never forget and I am certain that it will make an impact on your life and be an encouragement to you and your Christian walk so we invite you to be with us tonight at seven o'clock now we want to listen to the black ox singers as they sing just before the message a song that simply is a prayer
[time=1433] set to music
[time=1463] Jesus let me see the things that you have for me let me hear your voice whenever you speak to me
[time=1490] Jesus let me feel your love so great for me
[time=1500] let me know your way is always the best for me
[time=1520] Jesus let me see the things that you have for me let me hear your voice whenever you speak to me
[time=1550] let me feel your love so great for me let me know your way
[time=1568] is always the best for me let me know your way
[time=1583] is always the best for me
[time=1593] thank you black ox singers for that musical prayer and as you find your bibles will you open the first
[time=1608] or to Colossians the first chapter and as we have our bibles turned to Colossians the first chapter we're going to pause together to pray and ask God's blessing upon our time in his word so i'm going to ask that with your bibles open you just pause with me for just a moment as we ask
[time=1625] God to bless this time together one of our deacons mr mark cluff is going to lead us to the throne of
[time=1631] grace in prayer father thank you for the opportunity to study your word and help us to know that
[time=1642] your way is always the best for us as we hear what you have to say to us today help us to be willing
[time=1650] to step out on faith and do what you want us to do in your son's name we pray amen
[time=1657] i'm reading from Colossians chapter one beginning at the 19th verse reading through verse 23
[time=1666] for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through
[time=1673] the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they
[time=1679] be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were once alienated and enemies in your mind by
[time=1685] wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you
[time=1692] holy and unblamable and unapprovalable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard
[time=1704] and which was preached to every creature that is under heaven of which i Paul made a minister
[time=1712] during the days that i attended the Dallas theological seminary i became acquainted with
[time=1719] some of the great men who have written from the faculty of that institution one of the men who has written prolifically is dr jade white pentecost an expert in the realm of prophecy and the head
[time=1732] of the bible department i took many courses from him and have many notes that i took under his
[time=1738] leadership i remember one day in a class when he was talking about the subject which we are about
[time=1744] to approach from the book of colossians he told a story that that related to his visit to a large
[time=1751] city in the east he said he was downtown visiting in this large city when a man walked out of a
[time=1758] jewelry store not too far from him who had obviously purchased a new watch as he walked out of the
[time=1765] store he realized that the watch had not been set and so he stopped in front of the window and looked
[time=1771] at the clock that was displaying the time in the jeweler's window and having seen the time on the clock he lifted up his watch and set his time he started to walk by but just as he walked by the
[time=1783] window he caught apparently out of the corner of his eye another clock toward the end of the jeweler's window and realized that what he had seen in the first clock wasn't what he had seen in the second clock so he stopped for a moment and reset his watch dr pentecost said he was quite amused by this
[time=1798] and watched him as he continued down the street to the corner where there was one of those large four-sided clocks that jutted up out of the corner the man looked at that looked at his watch
[time=1808] looked back at the clock and sure enough he lifted his rich watch and changed the time again he thought the story was over but just as he was about to leave pentecost said he looked across
[time=1819] the street and saw him going down the street in halfway in the middle of the next block was another jeweler's store and you guessed it he stopped in front of the window examined the clock and once
[time=1828] again changed his time dr pentecost made this point and it's a very good one that the problem
[time=1834] with people today is there is no absolute standard to which they adjust their lives we seem to go through life walking from one jewelry store to the next changing our standards on the basis of the changing more ways of our society and that is very true the fact of the matter is
[time=1851] that god declares in his word that there are not changing standards to which we are to be adjusted
[time=1858] but that god has set an absolute standard and we if we are to be happy and wholesome and prosperous
[time=1864] in our lives must adjust ourselves to the absolute standard which is god now of course when we recognize
[time=1872] the challenge of that assignment we realize that in and of ourselves we are incapable of doing it and that's why the bible tells us that god has already made provision for us to be in phase with
[time=1884] god himself anyone who knows anything at all about our world knows that one of the problems in fact the problem of the universe is that since sin entered the world in the Garden of Eden
[time=1896] we have gotten out of sync with god the text which i have read to you this morning is a text which
[time=1902] deals with the subject of how the world and how we who are part of the world get back into phase
[time=1908] with god and the theological term which is used to describe that concept is the word
[time=1914] reconciliation it is a word which means to bring two who are not in agreement back together
[time=1921] now in the days of the bible there were generally two different ideas of reconciliation that were
[time=1928] understood the greeks thought that reconciliation meant appeasing their gods so that their gods would
[time=1935] change their minds about them and so they went into great and long detailed sacrificial systems
[time=1942] and all kinds of body flagulations to try to appease their gods so that their gods would indeed change their minds toward them but the historic christian position which comes out of the roots
[time=1953] of Judaism is that god does not change his mind but that god needs to have man change his mind
[time=1961] about god and so reconciliation from the biblical standpoint means that which god has done
[time=1968] to cause man to be to be reconcilable to cause man to be able to relate to god in a positive way
[time=1975] and in this text the word reconcile is used several times now i want us to notice the reasons why
[time=1982] reconciliation are necessary why is it necessary for god and man to have something happen between
[time=1989] them so that they can be one in the same in fellowship first of all i want you to notice
[time=1995] from this text that the need is a universal need the bible says that god through reconciliation
[time=2002] has brought all things unto himself to reconcile all things unto himself that means that there is
[time=2010] something wrong in the all things of god's world something wrong in the universe and it ought to be
[time=2017] obvious to all of us who have had our eyes open at all during these recent days that there is something wrong with the universe this world in which we live this universe which we enjoy is not now at its present time in the state that god wishes it to be or that he wants it to be
[time=2035] nor that it will be ultimately god created a beautiful and perfect world and yet we're told in the book of genesis that sin entered into the world through willful disobedience of god's creation
[time=2046] and the curse was passed upon the world and from that moment the world has been out of phase with god
[time=2052] if you would out of synchronization with god's plan and so we have the evidences of that on every
[time=2059] hand we have the ecological problems in our world today pollution we have all of the problems that
[time=2065] have to do with the inability of god's creatures to relate positively to one another and so there are wars and rumors of wars and fightings and and disagreements and and all kinds of turbulence
[time=2077] among the creatures of god's world what is wrong that is not god's ideal that is the reality of this
[time=2084] world because of the entrance of sin into the world which caused the world to get out of phase with god and men and women this universe this world of ours is not in sync with god today and that's why we have all these problems but the bible says that god looked down upon this universe upon
[time=2100] this world and recognized the need for the world the universe to be brought back into synchronization
[time=2107] with himself and so he did something about it he realized that the problem was the entrance of sin
[time=2114] into the universe and so he set out to deal with the problem in dealing with sin and the bible tells
[time=2120] us that what happened back yonder on the cross when jesus christ was crucified and when he paid
[time=2126] the supreme penalty for sin was that which will be the means god uses to ultimately reconcile all
[time=2133] things unto himself and so we look forward to that day along with paul who wrote in the book of romans when all the creation groaneth until the day of redemption there is coming a day and i
[time=2144] don't believe it's far from us when god in heaven will take that which christ did on the cross and he will apply it to the universe and that which has been out of phase and out of sync in our world
[time=2155] will be brought back into phase and back into synchronization when the old world and the old heavens are done away and the new world and the new heavens are brought into being and this universe is what god intended to be before sin entered into the world the bible says that reconciliation
[time=2172] what christ did on the cross by way of paying for sin was necessary in order that the world be brought back into fellowship with the father but that's rather nebulous and most of us can run
[time=2185] away and hide in that truth and it's not very convicting nor does it cause us many problems it's just a theological truth but this very text goes on to say that not only is it the universe
[time=2196] the all things that need to be reconciled unto god for remember the world was created by jesus christ
[time=2203] by him it holds together by jesus christ it consists by him and it was created unto him
[time=2209] in other words unto the final a resolution of all things in the world unto god but the bible also
[time=2216] says that the problem that necessitated reconciliation was the problem of individuals being out of phase
[time=2222] with god and that's why we read in this very text in verse 21 that there was a time in the life of
[time=2230] every person before he was saved and this is true of every person who has not accepted christ right now here's what it says you were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now
[time=2243] have he reconciled the reason why reconciliation was necessary the reason why it is necessary today
[time=2249] is because the bible says man is out of sync with god man is out of fellowship with god he cannot
[time=2256] relate to god because his life does not measure up to god and the bible puts it this way we are
[time=2263] alienated from the life of god we are enemies by our minds with god i have observed as i've
[time=2271] talked with people who have not accepted christ as their savior that every person who is out of who is not a christian who does not know christ as their savior is either an active or passive rebel against god in their hearts there is a clenched fist that lifts itself up to god and says
[time=2287] leave me alone i'll do it myself i don't need your help stay out of my life i'm independent i'm
[time=2293] capable of doing my own thing i don't want god in my life the two words that are used in this
[time=2300] verse to describe our situation before we come to christ are very strong words alienated enemies
[time=2308] that means there is hostility involved you say pastor dave what does that mean well i've been
[time=2314] telling you consistently that effecian's is a good commentary on collations and so let's get effecian's commentary in the second chapter of the book of effecian's and verse 12 effecian's chapter
[time=2325] two and verse 12 here again paul writing to the church at Ephesus reminds them of what they were
[time=2332] before christ entered their lives that at that time you were without christ being aliens there's
[time=2339] the word again from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having
[time=2345] no hope and without god in the world that's what a person is like who does not know jesus christ
[time=2351] how does that work well look over in effecian's chapter four and verse 18 and in the 18th verse
[time=2357] the commentary is completed having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god
[time=2365] through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart that passage of scripture says that the problem to which paul alludes in the 21st verse of the first chapter of collations is this that man apart from a supernatural work of god in heaven has no way of relating to
[time=2383] god because there are two things wrong with him his attitudes are wrong and his actions are wrong his attitudes toward god are totally hostile he does not want god in his life he does not want
[time=2396] god calling the shots if you were in his own person he wants to do it himself he has determined
[time=2403] that it is his life and he will do his own thing we're living in a generation of hostility to god
[time=2409] we call it do it do your own thing but that's hostility toward god because god does not embrace
[time=2415] that philosophy he says that we are his creatures and we belong to him that he has a claim on our life and we have no right to ourselves but every person outside of christ that i've ever met
[time=2427] is in some measure expressing what this verse says in their minds they are alienated from god and
[time=2438] so when your attitudes are wrong your actions are wrong and that's why it says your works are hostile to god we get so concerned when we look out at a world that is filled with sin and we say look what he did look what she did look at those actions look at those works they're terrible sinful things and that's true but we must not look at the symptom and make that the cause the works
[time=2458] and the actions and the things that are happening men and women are simply the result of the deep sickness which is called sin and sin is active or passive rebellion toward god that's why
[time=2470] we need somebody to do something to straighten that mess out now you say well can't we change it
[time=2478] ourselves well that's what religion tries to do religion tries to take this problem that i've
[time=2484] described and working from the outside in straighten it out sir robert anderson
[time=2491] in one of the fundamentals from his pen wrote one time a very good statement he's said no amount of success no measure of attainment in this realm can put us right with god and then he used this
[time=2503] illustration he said if a house is in darkness because the current has been cut off no amount of
[time=2510] care bestowed on the plant or the fittings will restore the light the first need is to have the
[time=2516] current renewed and it's my observation that modern religionism spends all of its time working
[time=2522] on the plugs and the sockets and the plants and the wires trying to dress them all up so that man
[time=2528] can get right with god and the problem is there's no power nobody has turned on the current only
[time=2534] god can do that and that's why reconciliation is necessary now what does the bible say happens in
[time=2541] order for us to get back into sync back into phase back into fellowship with god notice what the
[time=2547] text says it gives us a very descriptive picture of reconciliation first of all we are reminded
[time=2555] that reconciliation is to an absolute standard notice that we are to be reconciled unto himself
[time=2563] verse 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto
[time=2570] himself it is not to one another it is not to the church it is not to some creed but we must be
[time=2577] reconciled unto god he is the absolute standard in first peter we're told be therefore holy
[time=2584] as i am holy there is no grating on the curve in god's classroom it is an absolute standard
[time=2591] i'm sure you've heard the amazing story of the factory that every morning telephoned a bureau for the time and they set their clocks to conform to that in formation and so every morning they called
[time=2605] every morning they set their clocks when the noon whistle of the factory blew the head of the bureau
[time=2613] changed his clock to conform to the noon whistle it was no wonder they were confused when they were
[time=2619] accepting each other as the standards the factory called the bureau to get the time the bureau changed
[time=2625] its time when it heard the factory whistle so every day that there was even one minute's difference between the two time pieces the the standard was moved and that is a good illustration of what
[time=2636] happens in our world today the bible says comparing ourselves to ourselves we lift ourselves up
[time=2643] unfortunately god doesn't allow that indoor sport in christianity i am amazed at how christians
[time=2649] look around and say well i'm not so bad is that person or people in the world say i must be ready to go to heaven because i'm better than that person the bible says that the standard isn't the person next door to me or the person down the street for me or the person across the way from me the standard is god and his standard is absolute and we must be reconciled unto him
[time=2671] every month we get our bank statements from the bank and on the bank there's a little worksheet
[time=2678] for you to reconcile your bank account do you know what i've discovered in all the years i've been
[time=2686] doing that it's a pain in the neck for one thing i've sensed giving it over to my wife i've given
[time=2692] her the privilege of doing that every month but you know what the bank's almost always right i'm
[time=2698] never right once in a while they make a mistake oh do i live for that day
[time=2704] but i've even noticed that when they make a mistake it's not my favorite so i have just come to accept the fact that the bank is the standard and i've got to
[time=2717] reconcile myself to the bank i can't get on the phone every month and say i don't like what you sent me in the mail i never do it's always too little but i have to be reconciled to the standard
[time=2730] and the standard is absolute now the illustration falls down just a bit because even banks make
[time=2736] mistake but god standard is never lowered and it is never less than 100 right and the bible says
[time=2743] we must be reconciled to god it is not a matter of god changing to meet us it is a matter of us
[time=2749] changing to meet god now how is that done the scripture says it is done through that which
[time=2755] christ did when he died upon the cross verse 22 says he did it in the body of his flesh through
[time=2762] death and if you go back up to verse 20 there is this third descriptive term through the blood through the body of his flesh through the blood through death that means that when jesus christ hung
[time=2774] upon the cross his purpose was to bring god and man together to take that which was hostility
[time=2782] and make peace out of it how did he do that well we've already learned from the book of collations that jesus christ was the unique god man he was a hundred percent god and a hundred
[time=2793] percent man united forever in one being and because of that he was the only person in all of the world
[time=2800] who could ever bring about reconciliation between god and man or you see there are some characteristics
[time=2806] that are needed in that person who will be a reconciler first of all they must be uniquely acquainted with both parties that person must know god and he must know man and the bible says of
[time=2818] jesus christ that he knew what was in man and he was the revelation of god himself that person
[time=2824] must be willing to suffer at the hands of both parties and the bible says that jesus christ
[time=2830] suffered a separation from god when he hung on the cross the most awful pain the world has ever
[time=2836] known and at the same time he suffered ridicule and rejection at the hand of man and so he demonstrated
[time=2842] again when he hung upon the cross that he was the only person he was the unique one who could bring god and man together jesus christ was the person who reconciled us through the blood through the body
[time=2855] of his flesh through death i want you to notice in passing how careful paul is to demonstrate that
[time=2862] this was an actual physical in-time sacrifice for remember that the nostic heretics who had
[time=2869] filled up the collation church with their teaching were trying to get the believers in the collation church to believe that jesus christ was not a human being for they believed that all matter
[time=2880] was evil and they could not accept the humanity of christ throughout history there have been many
[time=2886] many battles over the person of jesus christ most of them have revolved around his deity is he god
[time=2893] or is he not but in paul's time the battle revolved around his humanity is he really a human being
[time=2901] and paul said yes it was through the body of his flesh through blood through death that he
[time=2907] suffered and brought about our reconciliation the nostics talk that jesus christ was a phantom
[time=2914] that he had some sort of a body but it wasn't real in one of their writings they said that when
[time=2920] jesus walked upon the seashore he left no footprints with his feet as if to illustrate that his body
[time=2926] was other than ours but paul would strike at the very core of that heresy and said no jesus christ
[time=2933] was humanity he was deity united forever in one person and when he went to the cross he paid the
[time=2940] penalty that brought god and man together for you see the reason why reconciliation is necessary
[time=2946] is because there is a barrier between two parties and the bible teaches us that the barrier between
[time=2953] god and man was the barrier of sin and the bible teaches that the wages of sin is death and the only
[time=2963] way that the barrier of sin could be removed from god and man was for someone to pay the full price
[time=2970] for that sin and that's what jesus christ did he went to the cross and he hung there and all of the
[time=2976] sin of the world was laid upon his back and he paid all of the penalty for it so that the barrier
[time=2982] could be removed and god and man could be brought together and that is why it is possible for a man
[time=2988] a woman a boy and girl a young person who is alive in this world today even though the world is filled with sin in the universe is yet to be reconciled to god at this very time in this very
[time=2999] moment to be reconciled with god and to be brought back into fellowship with him and what does the
[time=3005] scripture say is the purpose of all of that well i want you to notice that there are two purposes for which we are to be reconciled the first one is found in verse 19 we are to be reconciled when
[time=3016] we are reconciled to god the thing that happens is that we have peace no longer are we at war
[time=3022] with god having made peace through the blood romans chapter five says therefore being justified
[time=3028] by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ what jesus christ did when he hung
[time=3034] upon the cross was he stopped the war between god and man and he made it possible for god and man
[time=3040] to have fellowship everyone that i have met who is apart from christ has displayed in either active
[time=3049] or passive ways they're rebellion against god and every christian that i've ever met who has come to the cross for full salvation has in some way or another said to me pastor i don't know how to explain it but somehow i need to say the war is over i'm not at enmity with god anymore
[time=3065] sometimes they say the burden has been lifted sometimes they say i don't know how to explain it except it all seems to work now i seem to be understanding what life is all about what is that
[time=3076] all of a sudden their life has taken that initial twist that puts it back into synchronization with
[time=3082] god you see the problem with being lost is not only that you're bound for an eternal hell but the problem with being lost is that in this life nothing makes sense as it ought to it's just like you're about a half a step behind just a little bit out of focus just a little bit out of synchronization and until you accept jesus christ as your savior and invite him into your life
[time=3103] and accept what he has done on the cross that twist back into fellowship that twist into phase into synchronization can't take place sometimes we say it this way that god has created every man
[time=3115] with a god-shaped vacuum in his heart and no man will ever be at peace with god until jesus christ
[time=3121] it is home in his life and oh what a thrilling thing it is to see men and women come to grips with
[time=3127] the doctrine of what christ did on the cross and accept jesus christ at face value for what he has
[time=3134] done for them and to come into fellowship with his son and with the father he has made peace
[time=3140] but if you read through the rest of the text you'll discover that he has given us the opportunity because of reconciliation to grow and progress in our christian experience it says that he reconciled
[time=3150] us and noted that we might be holy and unblameable and without reproach before him in that day and
[time=3158] that means that someday you and i are going to stand before god in the moment of judgment and god is
[time=3164] going to look at me and he's going to say there stands david jeremaia a sinner but a sinner saved by
[time=3170] grace and as i look at him through the person of jesus christ i declare him to be holy i declare
[time=3177] him to be unblameable i declare him to be without reproach before god i declare him to be fit for
[time=3184] heaven because he has accepted my son's sacrifice and i see him now through the person of my son
[time=3190] the lord jesus nobody who ever gets into heaven will get there in any other way except by way of
[time=3196] jesus christ and what he did when he died upon the cross some time ago i read the story
[time=3203] that took place in a western city husband and a wife became separated and finally divorced
[time=3213] they left the city and moved off to different places different parts of the country
[time=3219] one day the husband happened to be back in the city where they had lived when they had been married he was there on business and he thought that while he was in the city he would go to the graveyard to visit the grave site of his son who had died
[time=3235] just before he and his wife had been separated he went to the cemetery and he was standing by the
[time=3244] grave reminiscing the happy days he'd enjoyed with his son when he heard a step behind him
[time=3252] and looking over his shoulder he saw his ex-wife the first expert the first uh feeling that he had
[time=3259] the first inclination that came to the both of them was to run to turn away but something held
[time=3265] them there they had a common binding interest in the grave and so as the story is told instead
[time=3272] of parting they ended up clasping hands over the grave of their son and there with their hands joined over that marker they were reconciled and the story has a happy ending that they were
[time=3284] reconciled to one another it took nothing less than the death of their son to reconcile them
[time=3290] to one another and men and women it took nothing less than the death of god's son to reconcile us
[time=3296] to the father and so it is true for every christian that when we stand before god we stand with our
[time=3302] hands clasped in the father's hands over the empty grave of his son who went to the tomb and rose
[time=3310] from the grave to demonstrate that the penalty had been paid and received and that we could indeed
[time=3316] be put back into sync with god and so the wonderful invitation and the wonderful opportunity that
[time=3322] god holds out to every person today is this the price has been paid all that needs to be done has
[time=3329] been done and god simply says be ye therefore reconciled unto god god doesn't have to do anything
[time=3336] more it's all been taken care of the sin problem has been dealt with there's no barrier there unless you allow it to be there and god holds out his hand now and he says to you you can know god
[time=3348] through my son jesus christ if you'll put your trust in him today every single christian has
[time=3355] to do that if they're going to go to heaven every single person has to reach out by faith and accept
[time=3361] what god has done through prayer by faith may god help you to do it today on this sunday
[time=3368] right here right now shall we pray our father our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed before the
[time=3379] in our mind's eye we see the cross and on that cross we see our savior hanging
[time=3385] between heaven and earth his out outstretched arms as if to include all of the world
[time=3392] his eyes looking up toward heaven his feet pointing down toward the ground
[time=3400] and we see in that picture the god man jesus christ who was very god of very god and
[time=3412] a hundred percent humanity we see him lift up his hand you've been sharing the bible hour with
