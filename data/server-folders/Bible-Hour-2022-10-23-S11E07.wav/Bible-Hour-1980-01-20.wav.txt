[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne,
[time=19] Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=47] It is always our purpose when we gather on the Lord's Day to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=59] and to lift Him up and to be encouraged in our own hearts as we reflect upon His life and His death and His resurrection.
[time=68] We welcome now all of those who have joined us by television and we trust that the purposes we have just described will be enhanced in your own lives as you share with us this service.
[time=79] The choir begins our worship as they take us back to the place where redemption was wrought
[time=102] and we thank you.
[time=132] [AMEN - 120 seconds]
[time=282] Thank you, choir.
[time=297] We appreciate your leading us in the worship of our Savior, the Lord Jesus.
[time=302] Quite often in the morning service we have enjoyed the ministry of two young men, Keith and Blake, we call them our male duo and only one of them showed up this morning.
[time=314] That's not really true.
[time=316] Both of these men are tremendous soloists in their own right and we have yet to have that blessing of sharing in their solo ministry and I want you to listen now to the ministry of Keith Brodygum as he sings for us, "He lives within my heart."
[time=335] My faith is not a fabled thing, a foolish vain imagining.
[time=349] My Lord is real, that's why I sing.
[time=355] He lives within my heart, he lives within my heart, he lives within my heart.
[time=371] My sins are gone, the guilt and shame, I am redeemed, no praise in my heart.
[time=394] My sins are gone, the guilt and shame.
[time=398] His name, and now to all I must proclaim, he lives within my heart, oh glad the swollen
[time=420] tongue and true, what peace it brings and glad the soul, it thrills my being through
[time=433] and through, he lives within my heart, he lives within my heart, Christ lives within
[time=449] my heart, praise God it so, my faith I know, Christ lives within my heart.
[time=465] There is no greater certainty in all the whole wide world to me than that my Lord has sent
[time=490] me free and lives within my heart, he lives within my heart, he lives within my heart,
[time=509] praise God it so, my faith I know, Christ lives within my heart.
[time=531] We're glad that you've decided to join us today on the Bible Hour and we've looked
[time=538] forward to ministering the Word of God to you on this particular day and we're glad to be home after a visit for a week in the Florida region where I was ministering the
[time=548] Word of God every day at Bible Town in Boca Raton, Florida and Donna it's obvious by the
[time=554] glow on your face that you didn't get all the meanings.
[time=557] I thought you did the work and I play.
[time=559] Right, well you got a nice tan and it's kind of nice to come back in the midst of January having felt a little bit of the warmth of the sun.
[time=567] We had a lot of surprises when we got there.
[time=569] We didn't know for sure what to expect from the Bible Conference and what kind of a flavor it would have but we had some really wonderful surprises didn't we?
[time=577] Yes, I think one of the biggest surprises to me were the number of people that were there on Sunday night when we got there.
[time=583] You spoke to over 2,000 people at first night and then as the week progressed we were just
[time=589] amazed at the number of people who came up to us and said, "I know you, I've seen you
[time=595] on the Bible hour and people from Chicago and South Bend and Indianapolis" and it was just a delight to get to know some of these folks.
[time=603] I guess I began to wonder after a while if anybody was there from Florida because I think everyone came from Indiana and Chicago and I'm not exaggerating when I say that we met dozens of families who are part of the Bible Hour family.
[time=616] I was both encouraged and at the same time challenged.
[time=621] I guess I was encouraged to find that people who attend Bible conferences are the kind of folks who watch the Bible Hour because that's where they get spiritual food and encouragement.
[time=631] I was challenged because many of these people that I met who said they had watched the Bible Hour consistently for many months we had never heard from before and I was reminded of the
[time=642] fact that they probably represent a whole host of people who watch and participate and share and benefit from the Bible Hour ministry but have never taken time to sit down and write
[time=653] to us.
[time=654] That I think we came away with a commitment in our own hearts that there are enough people
[time=660] who relate to the kind of ministry God has given us on the Bible Hour television program
[time=666] to make sure that its needs are always met but there's a problem someplace between when
[time=672] the ministry reaches them and when we hear and there's some things that we really desperately need to have happen from them isn't that right?
[time=679] That's right I think I can identify with them because I know I procrastinate doing things that I want to do and I know that I should do and I sometimes think well somebody else will do it so I don't need to but it's so vital that we hear from these folks who are watching week after week so that this ministry can continue.
[time=697] I guess the thing that has come through in my own heart is the fact that the Bible Hour people are a special kind of folks they have a love for the Word of God and they want the Word of God to continually be taught and preached they know that we're committed to that they know that this is not an hour of promotion but it's an hour of ministry that's the way we want it to be but men and women you who are Bible lovers and those of you who appreciate the Word of God being taught we need your help and you're the ones who are going to have to stand with us during these days in the development and growth of the Bible Hour television ministry I want to ask all of you who are a part of the great family of the Bible Hour
[time=738] television audience if you haven't written to us before to let this challenge be to you
[time=745] and right now get a piece of paper and a pencil or a pen and make plans to write us as soon
[time=752] as we go off the air today we need to hear from you if the people who appreciate the Word of God and stand for the truth of God's Word will band together behind this ministry
[time=763] it can go forth in victory and the needs will be met if we continue to have a great number
[time=769] of folks who watch but don't participate then the Bible Hour will be moved off of the air
[time=775] and replaced by a ministry that won't meet the need as this program has met the need
[time=781] in your life so let me encourage you even as we have tried during these few moments to be a part of what God is doing through the Bible Hour television ministry when you write we have a special Bible study tool that we want to send you Donna this is the answer book mailed out already to thousands of homes but still in great demand as people hear about
[time=802] it for the first time and what the answer book is is simply that it's God's answer to
[time=809] the various situations that we face in life if you're going through a time of sorrow it has a section on sorrow perhaps your heart is just bubbling over with joy because of
[time=820] the blessings that God has given to you and you want to praise him and there's a section in there that gives you verses that just praise the name of our wonderful Savior who has given
[time=831] us so much and if you would like to have your copy of the answer book all you need to do is write to pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and we
[time=845] would just be delighted to send you a free copy of that this week along with this systematic
[time=852] tool of studying the Bible from a topical basis we also have a plan to help you read through the Bible in a year it's a very exciting devotional guide called the daily walk it comes into your home each month with a plan to help you read through the Bible each year
[time=867] in just 15 to 20 minutes of reading and studying you can go through the entire Bible both old
[time=873] and New Testaments have the joy of accomplishing a task that has been a goal of many people
[time=879] down through the ages when you read the word and it gets into your heart you'll discover what a tremendous blessing it can be in your own life once again the free copy of the daily
[time=889] walk is yours for the asking if you write to us we'll send you the first copy free we'll
[time=895] tell you how you can get involved in receiving the daily walk each month in your own home and that's another way that we can keep you going in the word of God for your own blessing
[time=905] in the things of the Lord now Donna we have some folks who have helped us in the Bible our ministry I guess it's alright to call them Bible lovers because I'm certain if they weren't they wouldn't want to be a part of it and and they wouldn't be underwriting it at the level that they are these folks are people that we call sponsors and associate sponsors and today I know you have two people you want to introduce who are associate sponsors for today's program yes I sure do one is a viewer in Chicago Mrs. Jenny Whitflitt and on channel 40 which
[time=938] is in Indiana Atlas and South Bend area is Earl Farmer and we say a big thank you to
[time=944] you two folks for sponsoring the Bible hour in your area today once again let me leave
[time=951] you with this challenge the Bible hour will only continue to be a ministry in your area
[time=957] as you get involved we're here every week and we're grateful for the privilege of sharing
[time=964] consistently God's truth but if we're going to continue to meet the needs of people who are hungry for God's truth in this day and age when programs on television are turning
[time=976] to politics and to all of the social issues and away from the clear teaching of God's
[time=982] word we must band together as Bible believing Christians and get behind this program so
[time=988] we hope we'll hear from you right to us this week and when you write make sure that you address your letter to pastor David Jeremiah post office box one five two five oh Fort Wayne
[time=998] Indiana we've been talking much about the Word of God today and in just a moment we're going to open our Bibles to the book of Colossians and the first chapter and I want to share with you five tremendous reasons to let the Word of God dwell in you richly I hope you'll
[time=1013] stay with us as we open the Scripture together.
[time=1043] [MUSIC]
[time=1073] >>Lena Peterson is coming now and she's going to sing a song to God be the glory for the
[time=1095] great things he has done we know this song in love it it's called my tribute.
[time=1101] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1161] >>I owe it all to me to God be the glory to God be the glory to God be the glory for
[time=1191] the things he has done with his God he has saved me with his heart he has raised me to
[time=1210] God be the glory for the things he has done all that He has made my life but let it be
[time=1231] the glory for the things he has made my life but let it be the glory for the things he
[time=1254] has saved me and with his heart he has raised me to God be the glory for the things he
[time=1277] has saved me to God be the glory for the things he has saved me to God be the glory
[time=1288] for the things he has saved me to God be the glory for the things he has saved me
[time=1297] to God be the glory for the things he has saved me to God be the glory for the things
[time=1304] that I talk to from time to time who say that they don't have very much to offer God by way of their gifts or abilities or talents or money and I always like to remind them of
[time=1317] this song and its theme and that is that when you give what you have to God even if it's a little bit it becomes much they're singing a very exciting arrangement of the song little as much if God is in it.
[time=1345] When God is in it, labor not for wealth or fame, there is a crown and you can win it
[time=1363] if you go in Jesus' name does a place you're called to labor seems so small and little
[time=1385] but it is great if God is in it, he will not forgive his own for his much when God is
[time=1403] in it, labor not for wealth or fame, there is a crown and you can win it if you go in
[time=1423] it when our conflict here is in there, when our race on earth is run, he will say if
[time=1444] God is in it when God is in it, labor not for wealth or fame, there is a crown and
[time=1494] you can win it if you go in Jesus' name there is a crown and you can win it if you go in
[time=1517] Jesus' name.
[time=1530] >>Thank you, Cortette.
[time=1535] I don't have to tell all of you folks here how I feel about that, I love it and may there be more where that came from in the future.
[time=1544] Thank you.
[time=1545] >>Open your Bibles to the first chapter of the book of Colossians and we're studying through this great book which exalts the Lord Jesus Christ as the preeminent one in life.
[time=1557] We come this morning to the ninth verse of the first chapter which begins one of the
[time=1564] great apostolic prayers which is recorded in the Epistle, one of the great and meaningful
[time=1571] prayers of Paul and I'm reading from my Bible as you follow in yours the first chapter of
[time=1577] the book of Colossians verses 9 through 14.
[time=1581] For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you and to desire
[time=1589] that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
[time=1596] that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness, giving thanks unto
[time=1612] the Father who hath made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light,
[time=1618] who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son, in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin.
[time=1631] The prayer of Paul for the Colossian believers.
[time=1636] John Calvin, one of the great figures in Christian history, studied for three or four years at
[time=1645] a French university, steeping himself in theology and the humanitarian sciences, hoping to become
[time=1653] what we would call, in our day and age, a man committed to the social reform of his day.
[time=1660] He planned to be a humanitarian until the day that he was converted, and when he became a Christian he instead became a preacher and a theologian and a teacher and, yes, a reformer.
[time=1675] Late in his life as he was reflecting back over these days, which I have just recounted for you, John Calvin said that in the early days of his life when he was studying to become
[time=1686] a humanitarian, he considered that the substance of life was to be found in this phrase, that
[time=1693] all of life was to live to learn.
[time=1698] That all his life was consumed with the quest for knowledge, that life in itself was nothing more than a pursuit after facts and information and knowledge.
[time=1708] He thought that life was encompassed in the phrase, we live to learn.
[time=1713] He said it was a tremendous thing that happened in his life when he found Christ as a Savior.
[time=1719] For somehow in the process, though he doesn't remember when it happened, this whole thing was turned upside down, and he discovered that in his life it was not a matter of living
[time=1729] to learn, but learning to live.
[time=1732] So all of his life since he became a Christian was committed and devoted to the principle of learning how to live.
[time=1743] When Paul prayed for the Colossian believers, in essence that's what he prayed for them.
[time=1749] He prayed that they would learn how to live, learn how to walk in the Christian experience.
[time=1756] Prayer is one of the first words recorded by him in his letter to the Colossian church.
[time=1763] Prayer is very much a part of the opening phrases of this letter, but we read in verse three that he gave thanks always for the Colossian believers.
[time=1773] He said in that same verse that he was praying always for them.
[time=1779] In verse nine he mentions that since the moment that he heard about the Colossians from the ambassador from the Colossian church, a young man we met a few weeks ago by the name of Epifras, he said, "Since I heard about the church, I do not cease to pray for you, always
[time=1797] lifting you up in my prayer." It is interesting that the priority of the apostle was a priority of prayer.
[time=1807] Before he would give any instruction to the Colossians, before he would tell them what to do, he brings them before God in prayer and he lifts them before the throne of grace.
[time=1818] Now verses nine through fourteen contain the substance of his prayer for the Colossian believers, and I suppose that I could summarize it all by saying that the prayer basically has one request, and the request is supported by five products that will come once that
[time=1836] request is answered and put into practice in the lives of the Colossian believers.
[time=1842] His request is summarized in the ninth verse when he says, "I do not cease to pray for you
[time=1850] and to desire that you be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all wisdom and
[time=1857] in all spiritual understanding." Paul said that his main concern for the Colossian believers was that they would be filled to
[time=1866] overflowing, that they would be controlled, that they would be consumed by the knowledge of the will of God or the knowledge of his word.
[time=1876] Later on in this same book he was to say in chapter three and in verse fourteen that his
[time=1882] concern for them was that they be built up, verse sixteen I'm sorry, that they be built
[time=1888] up and that the word of Christ dwell in them richly, that God's word fill their lives to
[time=1894] overflowing.
[time=1896] It does not take long to discover that being filled with the will of God and being filled with the word of God are synonymous terms.
[time=1904] For God's word is the written declaration of his will.
[time=1908] It is God's putting down for us in print what his desire for our lives really is.
[time=1914] And Paul said, "My prayer for you is that you will be filled to overflowing with God's
[time=1920] will for your life which comes from his word.
[time=1923] He qualifies that with two expressions in all wisdom and in all spiritual understanding.
[time=1931] Now the word wisdom is mental excellence at its highest and its best.
[time=1936] It means that the Colossians would understand what God said.
[time=1941] The word spiritual understanding is the practical application of that.
[time=1946] It is one thing to understand what God says, it's another thing to see how that is worked out in everyday life, spiritual understanding is a term which means how you take the word
[time=1956] of God and apply it to the situations that you face every day.
[time=1960] So Paul basically is praying that these believers will know what it means to know the will
[time=1966] of God and the word of God that they will comprehend what it says and that they will see how it fits into everyday life.
[time=1975] In Ephesians five seventeen he said something very similar to the Ephesian believers.
[time=1980] He said be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
[time=1986] Paul's consuming desire and overwhelming concern for the Colossian believers was that they
[time=1992] might know the word of God and the will of God and that it might be related to their lives in everyday practice.
[time=2000] It is not unlike the words which God gave to Joshua back in the Old Testament in the book of Joshua chapter one when he was preparing Joshua to lead his people Israel.
[time=2010] He said Joshua here is the key to your being successful in that which I have called you to do.
[time=2016] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein
[time=2022] day and night.
[time=2024] That thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt find good success Joshua chapter one
[time=2035] verse eight.
[time=2037] God said Joshua if you want to be successful and if you want to move forward in the job that I've called you to do be consumed, be filled, be overwhelmed with God's word for
[time=2048] your life.
[time=2050] That's why the psalmist wrote in Psalm one that the godly man is the man who meditates in the word of God day and night and the result of that is that he becomes like a tree that
[time=2061] is planted by the rivers of water.
[time=2063] He is stable, he is secure, he knows what it is that God wants him to do.
[time=2070] Paul said my prayer for you is that you be filled with the knowledge of the will of God.
[time=2076] Now the rest of the text is the support for the request.
[time=2081] There is his request and now Paul says if you do that here's what will happen.
[time=2087] There are five phrases which are subservient to that request.
[time=2091] Five things that Paul says will happen to the person who truly comes to understand what it means to spend time in the word and let the word grow richly in their lives.
[time=2102] You may be surprised at some of the things God promises to the person who will be consumed by his word.
[time=2108] The first one we see in the text which begins the real body of the message in this passage
[time=2114] of scripture is this, if you are filled with the knowledge of the will of God and with his word you will be pleasing the Lord constantly.
[time=2124] He says being filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and understanding that
[time=2130] you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.
[time=2139] Now in the Bible several times we are told about the worthy walk.
[time=2144] For instance here we are told to walk worthy of the Lord over in Ephesians chapter four verse one we are told to walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called.
[time=2153] In Philippians chapter one verse twenty seven we are told that we are to let our conduct be as it become of the gospel we are to walk worthy of the gospel.
[time=2162] In first Thessalonians two we are told to walk worthy of God to twelve.
[time=2168] What does it mean to walk worthy of the Lord?
[time=2171] Well Paul defines it for us here very clearly.
[time=2174] He says that the worthy walk is the walk that pleases God.
[time=2179] It is the walk which is always anticipating everything the Lord wants us to do and doing
[time=2185] it.
[time=2188] Now in John chapter eight in verse twenty nine we are told that the Lord Jesus Christ did always those things which pleased God.
[time=2197] That just blows my mind when I think of it.
[time=2199] It is a statement of true fact that Jesus Christ never did anything that displeased God.
[time=2204] He always did those things which pleased the Father.
[time=2208] And even though I know that we do not have the divinity within us that Christ had in that He was God that high and holy goal is set before every Christian that we do always those
[time=2220] things which please the Lord.
[time=2223] Now this passage of scripture tells us men and women that when we are filled with the word of God and the will of God one of the byproducts is we learn how to continually and
[time=2233] constantly and consistently please the Lord.
[time=2238] You see it is a very basic principle that we understand in terms of everyday life that
[time=2245] it is only as you get to know a person that you get to understand what pleases a person.
[time=2257] I have learned in the long relationship that my wife and I have that there are certain things which please her.
[time=2264] I have also come to understand some things which displeases her.
[time=2270] For instance I am always in a hurry.
[time=2273] I must have been born in a hurry I have been in a hurry ever since I can remember and when we have to go someplace I will call home and I will say Donna I am coming you be ready when I come.
[time=2283] Now I found out that pulling into the driveway and beeping the horn does not please my wife.
[time=2290] In fact I have learned that that seems to prolong the process.
[time=2296] I have an idea that another coat of makeup goes on maybe the hair gets fixed a little better and a little more extra time so over the period of time that we have been married I have discovered as I have come to know Donna that it does not please her for me to do that.
[time=2310] I find that relationship in my children.
[time=2313] I think my son David since Christmas time has come to understand that it does not please his father for him to play his computer game in the back seat of the car while we are going somewhere.
[time=2324] I think he has come to understand in his knowledge of his father that that does not please his father it drives him right up the wall in fact.
[time=2334] Now these are simple things and we all identify with him but we understand the principle do we not that when you come to know someone you come to understand what pleases that person
[time=2344] and what displeases him.
[time=2347] I cannot help but wonder if our struggle with much of the question of the will of God is
[time=2353] not found in this complete principle given us in the word of God and that is that we
[time=2359] do not know God well enough to know what pleases him and what displeases him.
[time=2364] Quite often people come and say do you think it would be alright if I did this or is it alright for me to take this action and I secretly expect that what they are doing is canvassing all of the Christian resource people hoping to land on someone who agrees with what they already have decided to do.
[time=2382] And the Bible says that we can come to please God continually and consistently and constantly
[time=2389] if we will let the word of God dwell in us richly and we will be increasing in the knowledge
[time=2395] of his will.
[time=2396] Have you ever engaged in an action gone to a place let something slip from your mouth
[time=2403] that maybe wasn't wrong in the sense that it was diametrically opposed to the written
[time=2409] word of God but somehow in your heart you weren't sure if it was pleasing to the Lord.
[time=2415] I am discovering as I am certain that you are that the more you know of this book and the more you come to know God through his revelation of himself the more conscious you are of that which pleases him and that which displeases him and Paul said as he prayed
[time=2429] for the Colossians my prayer for you is that you will be so filled and overwhelmed with the word and will of God that you will be pleasing God and that you will be pleasing
[time=2440] God constantly.
[time=2443] Now secondly Paul says that the person who is filled with the will of God and the word of God will be progressing in he will be progressing in knowledge or producing fruit constantly
[time=2457] or consistently.
[time=2458] This is what he says that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful
[time=2464] in every good work.
[time=2467] Now the relationship of the fruit of the believer to the word of God is found earlier in the same chapter back in verses 5 and 6 this is what we read for the hope which is laid
[time=2478] up for you in heaven of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto you as it is in all the world bringeth forth fruit as it dothen you.
[time=2489] This passage of scripture says that the word of God is related to the fruitful life that when the word of God dwells in us richly it causes us to be consistent in bearing fruit for the Lord.
[time=2500] Now most of us have been fruitful at one time or another in our Christian experience we seem to go in spurts do we not we are fruitful for a while and then we become unfruitful we do well for a little bit and then we do not do so well and there is a very interesting principle here that we must not miss and that is our consistency in the word is related
[time=2520] to our consistency in fruit bearing and if you go back and examine your own life and discover those times when you had no fruit and when you were not fruitful you will probably discover that it was also a time when you were neglecting the word of God in your own life.
[time=2535] Paul said I pray for you Colossian believers that as you are filled with all the knowledge of the will of God the result of that will be that you will be being fruitful in every
[time=2546] good work and it will be a consistency in your life remember last week we talked about the fact that fruit is in three forms there is fruit of conduct Romans six there is fruit
[time=2556] in converts Romans one there is fruit in character Galatians five and Paul says the person who
[time=2563] is filled and overflowing with God's word will be producing that fruit over and over
[time=2570] and over again consistently now notice thirdly that when the person who is filled with the
[time=2577] will of God and the word of God finds that he is pleasing the Lord constantly and bearing fruit consistently he will also discover that he is progressing in knowledge continually
[time=2589] he says that she might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God Paul said that the man who is consumed
[time=2601] by God's word and spends time meditating and studying and understanding the truth of God will discover that he is increasing in his knowledge of God as he spends more and more
[time=2612] time with the revealed word the revelation of God himself he increases in his understanding of God that was the challenge that the apostle Peter threw out to those who read his epistle
[time=2623] when he wrote in his swan song the last words that are recorded from his pen 2 Peter 3 18
[time=2631] but grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Christians are responsible to be continually
[time=2640] growing in knowledge and to understand more about God today than they understood about
[time=2646] him yesterday over in second Peter we're told that we're to add to our faith virtue
[time=2652] and to virtue knowledge sometimes when I'm with a certain kind of Christian I get the
[time=2658] idea that God does not place much of a priority on knowledge that there is a certain kind
[time=2664] of spirituality that comes to the ignorant that somehow if we can evacuate our minds from
[time=2672] all thoughts of intelligence God sweeps into fill that space with himself was illustrated
[time=2678] to me some years ago when I was preaching as a part of a traveling quartet when I was
[time=2684] in college after I got finished one dear sister met me at the door and she gave me a
[time=2690] good long lecture she even addressed me with terms of endearment often reserved for young
[time=2696] preachers she called me sunny she said now Sonny I want to tell you something she said
[time=2703] I saw you using notes she said I don't think that a preacher ought to ever use notes and she said I don't think you ought to even ask any questions you not even be prepared for whatever you say you should take the instruction of the New Testament and stand in the pulpit and open your mouth and let God fill it I remembered a couple of times in speech class
[time=2724] when I had tried that and it never worked I don't believe God wants it to work today
[time=2730] because you see God is just as much a part of the preparation as he is as a part of the communication sometimes as Christians we get the impression that it isn't important that we know anything but God continually places a priority on knowledge and that's why in this
[time=2746] church we teach doctrine we preach expository messages we teach the word of God because it's
[time=2752] important for all of us to be increasing in the knowledge of God suppose with me for a
[time=2758] moment that ten years ago you deposited one hundred dollars in a local bank and then in
[time=2764] a time of testimony we're declaring that every week for the last ten years you had drawn out of that account twenty five dollars you say pastor there is no bank that I know of that has a plan like that and you're right and yet it is a disturbing fact that many
[time=2781] Christians operate that way in their spiritual lives some years ago they made a very good
[time=2788] deposit of knowledge about God in their life maybe during a time in Bible school maybe during
[time=2794] a time when they were sensitive to the things of God and every day and every week and every month since that time they have been trying to draw out of that reservoir but they've been making no inputs into it and pretty soon the old reservoir dries up and there isn't
[time=2810] anything left and that's why Paul prayed that as these men and women in Colossae were to fill themselves with the word of God that the result of that would be that they would be progressing in their knowledge of God now let's review for just a moment when a man or
[time=2827] a woman is filled with the will of God or the word of God he will discover that he is pleasing the Lord constantly that he is producing fruit consistently that he is progressing in
[time=2838] knowledge continually now here's the one where the rubber meets the road Paul goes on to say
[time=2846] strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long
[time=2852] suffering with joyfulness now whatever we read in the word of God in the New Testament
[time=2858] about strength and power and might do we not usually get in our minds a picture of something
[time=2865] which demands a dynamic outflow of God's power maybe it's powerful preaching or powerful
[time=2873] praying or some great act that God does on behalf of a brother or sister in Christ maybe
[time=2880] it's something that is done through a dynamic song or a great choir number it always gives us the picture of something which is dynamic in its character but you will discover as
[time=2891] you study the New Testament and I have been discovering this over and over again as I have read the epistles that very often they power and strength and might of God is coupled
[time=2902] with that which we might consider to be the passive virtues of life notice what he says
[time=2910] we will be strengthened with all might according to his glorious power that we might shake our world for Christ that's not what it says it says so that we can endure patiently and
[time=2922] be long suffering with joy the fourth product of the word filled will of God filled life
[time=2932] is that we will be persevering in stress cheerfully how often I see Christians who are persevering
[time=2944] but not very cheerfully well I'm just hanging in there I don't like it I don't know why
[time=2951] God's doing this to me I'm trying to be patient it's not good why did he pick on me but praise
[time=2962] God anyway that's the way I usually hear Christians talking about their problems now
[time=2973] the Bible says that when God's word comes to live within us and his will is filling us we will be able to come to the place where in the midst of difficulties and stress and
[time=2984] problems we will be able to have patience and long suffering with joy you say pastor
[time=2994] that's not natural no you're right it's not it's supernatural it comes only to the person
[time=3001] who takes God's prescription for it say does anybody here have any stress any of you have
[time=3008] any problems you've been living with for a while any of you struggle to maintain a positive attitude toward life because all the things that are happening in your life here's the key to it don't miss it God says there is a direct relationship between the amount of
[time=3023] the word that you allow to live within your life and your ability to persevere joyfully in the midst of difficulty it's amazing to me how often when I'm studying a passage of
[time=3034] scripture God gives me illustrations to demonstrate how much I need the truth in my own life twice
[time=3042] last weekend while I was meditating on this passage and thinking about leaving for a week of Bible conference I had a trip for a speaking engagement and in both situations I ended up
[time=3054] sitting in an airplane for over an hour not going anywhere knowing that I was already
[time=3061] on a tight schedule and that I was going to be late I don't know if you know what that's like to be strapped into a seat and have the pilot come on and say it'll only be a few
[time=3072] minutes and we'll be taking off and know he's lying because you see all the planes out the window that are ahead of you there's not anything you can and and and and then to be studying the word of God that tells you you're supposed to be joyful in the midst of stress but we
[time=3087] all need it don't we and many women I want to tell you that the world has the same kind of problems and the same kind of stress and the same kind of difficulties we have and so often our response to that is no different than theirs the Bible says that as we allow God's word to just dwell in us richly and we're filled with the knowledge of his will the
[time=3108] result of that can be in our lives that we can learn how to be in difficult situations with a smile on her face or as someone said like tea kettles up to our neck in hot water
[time=3118] and still singing last but not least I want you to notice that the man or the woman who
[time=3127] is filled with the knowledge of the will of God or the word of God will not only be pleasing the Lord constantly and be producing fruit consistently and progressing in knowledge
[time=3139] continually and persevering in stress cheerfully you'll be praising the Lord correctly giving
[time=3149] thanks unto the father and then notice the things on the thanks list when you thank the
[time=3156] Lord the last time what did you thank him for good health a warm home a loving family
[time=3163] a good church a place where you can get your your needs met when was the last time you
[time=3169] thanked the Lord like Paul suggested here his thanksgiving list is filled with spiritual
[time=3176] things for Paul understood that praise in its truest and best sense was acknowledging
[time=3183] the character and work of God we have much to learn about that in our Christian lives
[time=3190] this praise list which will be the text of our message next week is a list which includes
[time=3196] such things as being grateful to God for our qualification for heaven things which have
[time=3202] to do with our redemption through the blood of Christ and our forgiveness for sins and our translation out of the kingdom of darkness and into the kingdom of light Paul said when you are filled with the word of God you will discover that the word of God makes its way into your prayers and you will be reflecting what you learn in the word back to God in thanksgiving because you will come to understand that the greatest blessings and that for which
[time=3226] you have most to be thankful are not the material things that so often fill our prayers but the spiritual things that God has done for us when he translated us out of the kingdom of darkness and he put us over here in the kingdom of light and he gave us forgiveness and the redemption through his blood how does a person learn how to praise God that way
[time=3247] through letting the word of God and the will of God dwell in him richly and fill his life now say this is a great prescription for some tremendous needs in all of our lives
[time=3258] this passage of scripture tells you and it tells me that when I spend time in the word of God letting it get into my life and fill my heart in my mind it will be possible for me to do that which the world cannot do I will be able to please God constantly and
[time=3274] produce fruit consistently and progress in knowledge continually and persevere in stress
[time=3281] cheerfully and praise God correctly all of those things can be mine and can be yours
[time=3289] in my response to the word of God but wait a minute you've got to have one piece of equipment
[time=3299] if I could use that term reverently before any of this works for you see this is all
[time=3305] based on your intake into the word into your life and the Bible says that the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him that means that a man or a woman who does not know Christ as his savior cannot receive God's word and
[time=3321] so he misses out on all of the benefits we've talked about this morning the question I'd like to ask you this morning is this wouldn't it be nice in your life to be able to do the things we've talked about the only way is to start at square one by receiving
[time=3339] Jesus Christ into your life he becomes the interpreter of the word and makes it possible for all of these benefits to accrue to your account you begin by putting your faith and
[time=3350] your trust in him inviting him into your life and accepting him as your savior you can do it today and begin the process of a lifelong relationship with God that will produce these
[time=3362] qualities in your life shall we pray if you do not know Christ as your personal savior
[time=3372] and you have joined us this morning by television I want to express to you that you can know him today by putting your trust in him and inviting him into your life asking for the forgiveness of sins simply by prayer making him yours and you can do it today and father
[time=3389] we pray that many who watch this morning many here in this auditorium who have yet to receive Christ will make their commitment to him even this hour it's a wonderful thing to review
[time=3400] our lives and know that our life is pleasing to be it's tremendous to be able to see the
[time=3407] fruit that is being produced in our lives regularly it's good to be able to look back over a period of time and see growth you've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah if as a result of this program you have made a decision about your relationship
