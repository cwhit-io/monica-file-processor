[time=0] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=207] - Thank you so much for being with us
[time=215] in the Bible, our television ministry today.
[time=218] I know that as you watch there at home that the Bible will be a great encouragement to you because that's exactly what God has promised it will be.
[time=226] He tells us in his word that it will not return unto him void, but it will accomplish the thing where unto it has been sent.
[time=232] And it's with that great encouragement in our hearts that we send this television program out to you each and every week.
[time=238] Don, it's a lot of work, but it is a lot of fun too, isn't it?
[time=241] - Yes, and I think the rewards come when we receive the mail from the many viewers who have received a blessing from watching the Bible hour.
[time=249] - I suppose if I live to be a hundred, I'll never be able to quite understand how it is that so many people write to share with us the blessings they receive from the Bible hour television program, and everywhere we go, we meet folks like that.
[time=261] And yet at the same time, we continue to face such a tremendous struggle from week to week as it relates to the support of the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=270] I suppose that one of the reasons why that's true is that we have determined not to do some of the things that are done by many of the religious telecasts in order to raise money.
[time=280] We have determined that our ministry will be just that, a ministry.
[time=283] And so it's very important that those of you who believe in the Bible hour and what it is doing, what we're seeking to accomplish, get behind us in the regular support of this television program.
[time=295] A few weeks ago, while I was away on a preaching mission, I was alone in a hotel room and kind of burdened about the ministry of television, and I wrote a letter to all of our friends and shared with them the need that we have in the Bible hour program as we face the 1980 season.
[time=313] Donna, you and I've talked about some of those things.
[time=316] The pressure gets a little heavy once in a while, doesn't it?
[time=319] Yes, it certainly does when you realize how many people there are out there who need to hear the gospel.
[time=325] How many are dependent upon the Bible hour because they have no other alternative, they are not able to go to church.
[time=331] And then we have to think about the possibility of discontinuing the Bible hour so that they no longer can receive it.
[time=337] It is a heavy burden.
[time=338] - And the only way we know to deal with that is to share that with you the best we know how through written form and on the television program.
[time=347] And to say to you again today, as you receive the letter from my desk, if you have already received it, or if you're about to receive it, as you open it up that you read it prayerfully and ask God what He would have you to do in support of this ministry.
[time=361] Even if you don't receive the letter and you appreciate what we're trying to accomplish in the preaching of the Word of God through this television program, your support is greatly encouraging and very much needed at this present time.
[time=374] Donna, what is the route that they take if they want to send a gift to help with the cost of the Bible hour program?
[time=381] - If you would like to help us, all you need to do is just sit down and jot a note to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 150-250-Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=394] And we'll be happy to send you a receipt for your gift.
[time=398] And if you are interested in just receiving information on how you can be a part of sponsoring the Bible hour, we'll be happy to send you that information.
[time=408] - We also want you to know that it is our privilege each week to inform many, many viewers of the opportunity to be involved in a regular Bible study program, which we call the Daily Walk.
[time=421] It is a systematic way for you to get into the Word of God and to study through the Bible in a year.
[time=427] It is a booklet that comes to your home every single month with an assignment and a commentary and a place for you to check off that you've read each assignment.
[time=435] And then at the end of the year, we have the opportunity of sending you a certificate that says you have read through the Bible in a year and that you've accomplished the goal of having read through the entire scriptures in a given year's time.
[time=448] The Daily Walk is available to you and we'll send you the first month free if you'll just write to us and request it and we'll give you the address again in just a moment.
[time=457] There's another little Bible study help that we think is kind of exciting and we've talked an awful lot about it.
[time=462] So maybe we don't have to say much about it, but Don, I'd like for you to remind them about the answer book too.
[time=467] - The answer book is a small little pamphlet that contains scripture verses on a variety of different subjects.
[time=475] And if you would like to have your copy of the answer book, all you need to do is write to us and we'll be sure to send one to you absolutely free.
[time=483] - Don, I know that you have a sponsor that you want to share with our viewers at home.
[time=487] Sponsors are those who underwrite the cost of a television program in their area for a given Sunday, either in their own name or in memory of someone.
[time=496] So why don't you share your sponsor with us today?
[time=499] - We have an associate sponsor today here in the Fort Wayne area and at Zella Overholt.
[time=504] Zella, we thank you for your part in the Bible hour today.
[time=508] - Before we go back to the service today, let me remind you that if you're interested in having more information about the sponsor's program or if you would like to be a part of the daily walk Bible reading program or receive your free copy of the answer book, you need to get in touch with us this week by mail and we want to encourage you again that we need to hear from many of you this week in your support of this television program.
[time=531] If you're not able to give a gift, at least write and let us know that we're touching your life through this ministry, that in itself is a great encouragement.
[time=539] When you write for any or all of these things, you need to write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=551] Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=559] Now we're getting ready to go back to our morning service.
[time=563] I trust that you'll stay with us as we open the Word of God again to the Book of Colossians and talk about what it means to serve the Lord Jesus Christ in the spirit of his life and death.
[time=572] (gentle music)
[time=581] (gentle music) - Thank you, Don.
[time=589] We love children at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and when the Lord told his people to go forward and replenish the earth, I think we as a church have taken that commandment very seriously.
[time=600] The other day my wife told me how many women in our congregation are expecting children within the next few weeks and it is an astounding number and we're building our church for the glory of God through every means available and we're just grateful to the Lord for the tremendous potential that we have to raise godly families in a context of Christian love and nurture and to have a Sunday school where children can come and hear the word of God taught and be blessed and strengthened in their faith.
[time=633] I don't think there's anything more exciting to me than hearing children sing.
[time=637] And especially when you get a lot of them together, they can really lift their praises to the Lord.
[time=642] And I believe that what we're gonna hear right now is the best children's choir we've ever heard in this church and I know you're gonna be encouraged and blessed as you hear them sing a song about love.
[time=652] These are the children of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the children's choirs, listen to them sing glory to the Lord.
[time=658] (gentle music)
[time=668] [MUSIC - 123 seconds]
[time=798] (audience applauds)
[time=806] - Pastor Krueger told me to say to all of you
[time=816] that these children practice as a part of the Wednesday night, midweek family ministry night.
[time=821] And so all of these children are here and practice on Wednesday nights.
[time=825] And if your kids aren't in the choir, it's because you're not here on Wednesday night.
[time=829] And that's just a little added incentive for you to be a part of what God is doing here in the middle of the week.
[time=833] Thank you children.
[time=834] We look forward to hearing from you again soon.
[time=837] We're so grateful for all of the many folks that God has given us in music.
[time=841] And we're going to ask the Peterson's to come and sing for us now.
[time=844] They have a beautiful song to share with us as we prepare our hearts for the message from the Word of God.
[time=850] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=1055] - Thank you, Peterson's for that ministry in music.
[time=1063] We have been very excited as we've watched the growth of our Christian school over these past four or five years.
[time=1071] One of the very interesting things about growing a school from the ground up is learning how to somehow participate with schools that are already grown up.
[time=1079] And we've gone through the trauma of having to play basketball and all of the other sports on the level with schools that have more grades than we do that extend up higher into the academic levels.
[time=1092] And it's been a very exciting thing to see how our children, our young people have responded to the challenge.
[time=1098] And believe me, if we can ever get our school grown up so that we're playing at the same level as everybody that we compete against, we're going to be really something else.
[time=1106] We've done all right even at that level.
[time=1108] And it starts way down in the lower realms of the school activities.
[time=1114] There are some children and young people who come here at 6.30 in the morning to practice basketball because there isn't any other time to use the facilities, the gym.
[time=1123] And we have fifth and sixth grade teams and junior high teams and girls' teams and boys' teams.
[time=1127] And when I see the master schedule for the athletic events for the year, it's enough to tire you out just to read it.
[time=1134] But I know what this means to the young people.
[time=1136] Someone has said a long time ago that there are two languages that kids speak and hear and understand.
[time=1141] One of them's music and the other's sports.
[time=1143] We better be sure we're speaking those languages if we want to keep our kids around and involved in what's going on.
[time=1149] So I'm grateful for everything that's happening in the sports program of the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1153] Today I want to take just a moment to honor some young men who have distinguished themselves in athletic prowess and have a great deal to be proud of as they look back over this past year.
[time=1165] Our junior high boys basketball team made up of seventh and eighth graders yesterday won the ACSI championship tournament beating Fort Wayne Christian School 63 to 21 at Fort Wayne Christian School's gym.
[time=1180] The seventh grade team, which is a separate part of that that plays some games in the Lutheran League was 10 and five in their overall record.
[time=1188] And our eighth grade team was 14 and one for the year.
[time=1193] The overall record of their accomplishments, they were the league champions in the city Lutheran League.
[time=1198] Now don't ask me to explain how back to school got in the Lutheran League, but it's great that we won it.
[time=1204] And I won't say any more about that either, but I'm just grateful that we had the privilege and our Lutheran friends have been so gracious to extend to us the opportunity of competition.
[time=1212] This year we happen to have the best eighth grade basketball team in the city.
[time=1216] I asked these young men to sit down in the front and I want them to stand up so you can see what a handsome bunch they are.
[time=1222] And their coach Craig Pearson has the trophy they won yesterday and I want these young men if you would to stand up.
[time=1227] This is our junior high basketball team from the Black Hawk Christian School and that's the trophy they won.
[time=1233] And I think you ought to let them know.
[time=1234] (audience applauding) And our basketball program is alive and well
[time=1248] and it's gonna be good for many, many years.
[time=1251] We have 11th graders now in the high school and the 11th grade team just won their league championship Friday night, the high school team, they're involved in some tournaments.
[time=1261] They lost a couple of games over in Ohio this past week.
[time=1264] I usually don't talk much about that, but we have some great things going for our kids.
[time=1270] And I know that there are a lot of folks that don't know very much about Black Hawk Christian School and I just want to tell you that it's a great place for your children to grow up, a great place for them to be involved in learning about the things of the Lord and having a great educational time as well as all of the other things that go along with being in school and in high school.
[time=1287] A very exciting thing happened this past week.
[time=1288] We had a man who was deeply concerned about the secondary level of our school who has given us $4, $1,000 scholarships to help in the secondary program for next year.
[time=1300] I didn't ask him to do that, but when he did it, God used that to encourage me and to give me this idea that if we would trust God together as a congregation and all of the many friends of Black Hawk who before next school year, be able to find 30 people who would give $1,000 scholarships to the academic part of the school and provide for some children who can't afford to come to a Christian school, we could build our secondary level school program in a very exciting and fascinating way so that we would be even better and be able to do more for our kids than we're able to do now.
[time=1334] I'm not gonna ask any of you personally to do that, but if God lays that burden upon your heart and you'd like to have a part in sharing the education of a young person by making a scholarship available, if you'll let me know, I'll be happy to talk to you about it and I'm sure Dick Moran, who is our school administrator, would be happy to do so as well.
[time=1351] I want you to take your Bibles and turn with me to the book of Colossians and in the book of Colossians, the first chapter, we're ready to begin reading at the 24th verse, Colossians chapter one and verse 24.
[time=1365] And as we read our Bibles, we will read through from the 24th verse to the end of the first chapter.
[time=1375] Colossians chapter one, verses 24 through 29.
[time=1379] Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[time=1385] and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church, of which I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God.
[time=1402] Even the mystery which hath been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Jesus Christ.
[time=1424] For this I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily, let's pray.
[time=1432] Lord, we would pray that you will take your words today and make it to touch us in the very deepest part of our being.
[time=1441] We're not interested in being hearers of the word only, we want to be doers.
[time=1445] And we realize that if we're to be doers of the word, we must hear and understand it beyond the level of just comprehension, but in the very heart of hearts in our souls we must hear.
[time=1457] And we must know that it is God speaking to us, not some individual, not some human being.
[time=1464] So I would pray that you will take the words of the Bible and by the Holy Spirit cause those words to reach down deep into the lives of men and women who hear my voice today and that the result will be eternal changes in the lives of people as they let God's word do its work in their life.
[time=1483] We have nothing to offer, Father, except as a channel, as a vehicle, as a messenger boy.
[time=1491] We pray that you will use us today to declare in truth what thy word has to say to each one of us, that we might be challenged and encouraged and motivated to serve you as we never have before in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1505] I'm sure that some of you have wished on occasion
[time=1511] that you could have lived during the time of Christ.
[time=1513] That perhaps you could have been a part of the ministering to his body which took place even in the events that surrounded his death.
[time=1522] The Bible tells us very, very explicitly that there were some people to whom God entrusted the opportunity of ministering to the body of Christ.
[time=1533] People like Joanna and Susanna and Mary Magdalene, men like Nicodemus who loaned to Jesus, his tomb for burial.
[time=1543] As you read the accounts and the gospels of these loved ones of the Savior who very, very touchingly, very tenderly cared for his body after his death, bringing spices to anoint and then bomb him, wrapping him in clothes of burial and making sure that all of those things which were proper for a Jewish burial were taken place.
[time=1566] When we think of their tenderness and their kindness in the ministry that they extended to the Savior, it is not hard to put ourselves in that place and say, were it me?
[time=1576] Had it been my opportunity to be in that place, certainly I would have wanted to have ministered to the body of the one I loved in such a tender way.
[time=1585] And yet, we can never go back to recreate that and we would not want to because his body is not in a tomb, he has been resurrected, he has seated at the right hand of the Father, never to die again, never to give anyone the opportunity to minister to his physical body again.
[time=1601] But the Scripture has some very interesting side lights for Christians who live in this particular age, one of which is recorded in our text, which I have read for you this morning, where we are reminded that one of the things that motivated the Apostle Paul in his ministry and service was his desire to minister for Christ, for his body's sake, which is the church, verse 24.
[time=1626] Now the Bible teaches that the physical body of Christ was that which was his vehicle for ministry while he was on the earth the first time.
[time=1634] When he came and walked among men and went to the cross to die, he ministered through his physical body, he was localized, if you will, where he went to minister, his body was the vehicle for ministering to the lost men and women around him, to the suffering humanity that met him.
[time=1652] But when he resurrected and went back to heaven and was seated at the right hand of the Father, he gave to us the wonderful truth of the church.
[time=1660] And he calls the church his body.
[time=1664] Someone has said that his physical body was body one and the church is body two.
[time=1670] We are the body of Christ in a very significant way.
[time=1674] God has called us as a church to do in essence in our time what the physical body did of Christ in his time when he walked upon the earth.
[time=1683] As he walked among men and reached out to suffering humanity, as he touched them, as he ministered to them, as he had compassion on them and cared for them.
[time=1692] So God has called the church of Jesus Christ of which those of us who have believed in Christ as our Savior are a part.
[time=1699] He has called us to do the same thing in our time.
[time=1703] The story is told of a quiet little man who was a vendor of vegetables from house to house.
[time=1708] He regularly passed the door of a Christian as he carried on his daily business.
[time=1715] One day he dropped a small notebook.
[time=1717] And as the Christian was walking outside of his house door that day he found the notebook lying on the ground and he picked it up.
[time=1725] He realized at once that it belonged to the vendor who visited his home each day.
[time=1729] And he was about to put it on the shelf to return it to his friend the next morning when he noticed a very interesting inscription written on the cover.
[time=1739] The inscription was the words of our text for today for his body's sake which is the church in quotation marks.
[time=1748] His curiosity got the best of him.
[time=1750] He couldn't understand what that phrase meant until he opened the book and he began to read the following things.
[time=1758] For his body's sake which is the church followed by these notations.
[time=1763] The following were absent from Bible school last Sunday.
[time=1767] I must visit them for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1771] Ask the woman about her sick baby in the church
[time=1777] for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1780] I must go to the hospital and visit the invalid who has been hospitalized from our Sunday school class.
[time=1787] I must do that for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1791] I must speak a word of cheer to that old cripple man I meet on the corner for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1799] When the peddler came back the next day the man who had found the notebook couldn't wait to ask him some questions about what he'd read.
[time=1807] He said that is a very strange way to go about your Christian business.
[time=1811] The peddler said this is my book of reminders.
[time=1815] Pointing to the first page he continued this is my motive, my reason for doing what I do for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1824] It keeps my soul out of the dust, he said.
[time=1828] For as I do these things for his children I know that I am ministering unto Christ.
[time=1834] I was reminded as I read that story that in the very same way that the Bible teaches us through the experiences for instance of Paul who when he was accosted on the road to Damascus was asked the question Saul, Saul, why persecute us thou me by the Lord Jesus.
[time=1852] When the Lord said Paul as you persecute the church you are persecuting me.
[time=1857] So he says in the positive realm as we minister to the church, as we minister to the body we minister to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1866] And that I believe is one of the reasons why Paul was so motivated to serve as he was.
[time=1873] He served for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1877] He realized that God had given him a tremendous opportunity in his lifetime to touch the Lord Jesus Christ through the body of Christ which is made up of all believers worldwide.
[time=1888] And so he gave himself week after week, day after day
[time=1894] in unceasing labor to touch the lives of men and women who were a part of his body which is the church.
[time=1902] Now in this text there are a number of activities in which Paul engaged as he ministered for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1910] They are activities which are available to every Christian who would likewise serve the Lord Jesus Christ through the church.
[time=1919] We are entering upon that part of the book of Colossians which moves away from the doctrine of the preeminence of Christ which we have studied and now moves to the practical duty of every Christian to serve the Lord Jesus Christ who is his Lord.
[time=1934] And Paul gives to us a tremendous example of how this ministry is to be done.
[time=1940] Let me share with you four things that were true of the Apostle Paul about his ministry for his body's sake which is the church.
[time=1949] First of all Paul introduces his subject by introducing us to the concept of suffering.
[time=1955] He said part of my ministry in the church was the ministry of suffering.
[time=1961] He writes in verse 24 that God had given to him the opportunity to fill up the sufferings of Christ which we're lacking.
[time=1969] Now that statement is puzzled expositors for many, many years.
[time=1974] But it need not be a puzzling thing when we understand that the sufferings which are mentioned in this verse do not have anything to do with the sufferings of Christ upon the cross.
[time=1983] It is not even the same word which is used for suffering in the text.
[time=1987] But it has to do with the sufferings which Christ experienced in his earthly ministry as he prepared to go to the cross and die.
[time=1996] It has to do with the persecution he received from those around him.
[time=2000] It has to do with the fact that he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[time=2005] It has to do with the fact that as he set his face like a flint toward the cross even his own disciples would dissuade him and cause him to faint back from the calling of Christ of God upon his life.
[time=2018] These experiences of suffering and tribulation in the life of Christ which he experienced as he walk upon the earth are the experiences to which Paul refers when he said God had given him the opportunity to fill up the sufferings of Christ.
[time=2034] The Bible says that the servant will be in the same category as his master.
[time=2041] Over and over again in the gospels we are asked the question if the Lord suffered why should we seek to avoid suffering in our own lives?
[time=2049] And yes, the Bible even tells us plainly that they that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[time=2055] When Ananias was asked by the Lord to minister to Saul right after his conversion, the Lord toward Ananias in Acts chapter 16 that he must show Paul what great things he must suffer for his name's sake.
[time=2071] One of the things that God would have us to do in the church as we minister to the body of Christ is to learn what it means to be involved in suffering.
[time=2081] None of us seek that, none of us like it.
[time=2085] We don't want it.
[time=2086] We run from it, some of us, the best that we can.
[time=2090] As we listen to the life action singers ministry in our midst last week and they shared with us the glory of the cross and recited for us from different places in the world, the sufferings of the body of Christ, sufferings which were endured because they had stood up for the things of God in Romania and in Russia and in the other countries that they mentioned.
[time=2111] I'm sure you were moved as I was when they came down the list of countries and they came to the United States and they said, and now we shall talk about the persecution in America and there was an experience of the eloquence of silence.
[time=2128] For Christians in America know very little about suffering, have had to pay very little for their faith.
[time=2136] The price of redemption has been paid by Christ upon the cross, but the price of living a Christian life is not paid by many American Christians.
[time=2144] We may well be living on the threshold of the days when that will change.
[time=2150] The events of our world signal that there are days ahead of us as Americans, which may very well cause us to stand up and be counted if we are going to be Christians.
[time=2161] And we may learn what it means to experience some of the persecution and the sufferings that Paul mentioned here in this text.
[time=2168] I wonder if we will be ready to do that.
[time=2171] As I look around at the weaknesses among most Christians and even the weaknesses in my own life, I realize how prone I am to shrink back from any of the demands of Christianity upon my life.
[time=2184] And as I look around at Christendom at large, I realize that there are very few pastors even who want to risk their reputation, who want to risk their calling, their quote unquote success to be counted among those who stand for righteousness in this day and age.
[time=2201] And men and women, if we are going to serve the body of Christ, it is going to be incumbent upon us in these days that are before us, that we not shrink back from carrying the cross of the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, and we be unashamed of the faith which is ours in the person of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2218] Paul said, I am willing to suffer for his body's sake, which is the church.
[time=2224] I don't know what kind of suffering it is that God would ask of you, but I do know this that part of the ministry we have is the ministry of suffering.
[time=2232] I don't claim to understand it, I've experienced very little of it, but as I read the text, I learn that that's part of my ministry in the body.
[time=2240] The second thing that I notice in this text is this, that Paul said as he ministered for his body's sake, which is the church, he was involved in serving.
[time=2252] Verse 24 tells us that he was a minister, a minister, verse 25, according to the dispensation of God.
[time=2260] Now the word minister is a word from which we get our word servant.
[time=2265] Paul did not claim to be an executive, an administrator, a bishop, or a part of any hierarchy, he said, I am simply a servant, and he claimed that his service was a dispensation from God.
[time=2277] That means that God in heaven gave to Paul a certain area of ministry.
[time=2282] He said, this is your stewardship, you serve in this area.
[time=2286] It was something God gave to him as a gift, a place of ministry.
[time=2291] Paul took that service seriously.
[time=2294] He was not clamoring for someone else's job, he was anxious to do his job.
[time=2299] He recognized that he had a slot to fill.
[time=2302] God had designed that place for him and put him in it and given it to him and he was to be accountable for it someday, a dispensation of God given to him.
[time=2312] I want to take just a moment to remind you that every Christian has been given a dispensation from God.
[time=2320] Every Christian, there is no such thing as Christian drones.
[time=2325] God doesn't have any drones in his divine beehive.
[time=2328] Everyone is to be a worker, everyone has a job to do.
[time=2331] Everyone has been given a dispensation from God.
[time=2335] I don't know what yours is, I have to be concerned about what mine is, but I know this, that everyone in the body of Christ has a job to do.
[time=2343] And it is our purpose and our determination as Christians to find out what that job is, to find out what area of stewardship we're to serve in, recognize that's been given from God to us and be serving God in that area.
[time=2358] That's how we touch the body of Christ.
[time=2360] There isn't any place for us to minister if we're not willing to serve.
[time=2367] There are some churches which design their leadership strategy by trying to find men who are successful in the world
[time=2377] and bring them in and put them in places of successful responsibility in the church, regardless of their spiritual qualifications.
[time=2386] I don't find any evidence of that being the leadership role pattern in the Bible.
[time=2391] Do you know how people go forward in the Christian church?
[time=2394] They go forward on their knees as they serve, as they get involved in ministry.
[time=2399] You look at everyone who's in a place of leadership in this church, they got into leadership by serving, by ministering, by touching the body of Christ, by understanding their dispensation given to them of God and ministering within that dispensation.
[time=2412] That's what Paul said God had called him to do in the body of Christ to be a servant.
[time=2418] Yes, it's one thing to suffer, it's another thing to serve, but notice that Paul goes on to say that he was involved also in speaking.
[time=2425] There is no evidence that Paul ever once, even for a moment, had been a part of that great and growing number called the silent majority.
[time=2433] Paul did not ever excuse his silence by saying he lived his life so that men could see his good works, but he was not gifted in speaking.
[time=2443] Paul said he spoke.
[time=2445] You know what happens to a person who determines that their testimony will be just their silent life?
[time=2451] Suppose it were possible for a Christian to live a good life and commit themselves to the fact, all I'm going to do is live my life before men.
[time=2458] I'm not gonna say anything, I'm just gonna live a good life.
[time=2462] Well, the obvious result of that is that people are gonna say, "My, what a good man he is." What a good man he is as they go down the road toward hell because they don't understand why he's good.
[time=2472] If you aren't going to speak, you can't be a witness.
[time=2476] There isn't anything in God's economy called a silent witness.
[time=2479] And notice what Paul said about speaking in verse 28.
[time=2483] He said, "Whom we preach, warning every man, "teaching every man in all wisdom, "that we might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus." Three times he uses the words every man.
[time=2495] Paul had a concept of the body of Christ, but it did not obliterate in his thinking the importance of the individual in the body.
[time=2505] And Paul said that his goal was not just to build a body in general, but to build the individual Christians who were in the body.
[time=2513] And he used three words to describe the process that he would use by preaching, by warning, and by teaching.
[time=2521] He said that he would preach the gospel to every man, and then he would put his arm around each individual, and he would warn them of the dangers ahead, and that he would minister to them and teach them and encourage them.
[time=2532] And the all encompassing goal in his ministry was that one day, as he stood before the throne of God, he could point to the men that he administered to, and he could present them to the Lord as mature Christians.
[time=2545] Paul did not have the idea that his commonplace among many churches today, that when we finally get them down the aisle and get them saved, the battle is over.
[time=2556] Paul understood that when a person came to Christ, it was time to start, to build, and to present, and to warn, and to preach, and to teach so that that person could grow into maturity, and then when he stood before God, he could be presented as a complete Christian.
[time=2571] And so Paul gave his life to speaking to individuals, to talking to individuals, to building up individuals, to warning individuals, to teaching and preaching and ministering in the wisdom of God that they might grow and be nurtured, and become what God would have them to be.
[time=2587] He was interested, both in the negative and in the positive realms of education.
[time=2595] He was not hung up as some are today about, once in a while, dealing with some negative issues.
[time=2600] Paul was a very positive person.
[time=2604] You read his writings and you'll see that, but when something was wrong and it needed to be dealt with, he dealt with it.
[time=2609] He and Peter had quite an interesting little confrontation over in the epistles because of sin in Peter's life.
[time=2617] And Paul was not ashamed to stand up and warn when there were problems.
[time=2622] He was not committed to the doctrine of positive thinking to the exclusion of the truth.
[time=2627] And we must watch against that in our day and age, as positive as we all want to be, and I'm committed to being positive as you know, but sometimes in order to be positive about some things, you gotta be negative about some other things.
[time=2640] I'm positive about the biblical role of marriage in the Bible.
[time=2645] That means I'm negative about anything that's an alternative to that.
[time=2649] And Paul was not ashamed to warn every man about the problems in their lives.
[time=2655] He spoke.
[time=2656] Could I say it, he confronted.
[time=2660] He saw believers on the pathway toward possible destruction
[time=2666] and he stood as a man in the path to keep them from going in the wrong direction.
[time=2671] That's how he ministered to the body of Christ.
[time=2675] That's how he touched Christ's body, which is the church.
[time=2679] He spoke.
[time=2680] He was willing to suffer.
[time=2682] And if you know about Paul, you know he did much of that.
[time=2687] He was committed to serving.
[time=2688] He was involved in speaking within the body.
[time=2693] Last but not least, the Scripture tells us that he was involved in striving, verse 29.
[time=2701] Notice what he says, for this I also labor, striving according to his working.
[time=2710] Now that striving isn't strife.
[time=2712] By that I mean contention.
[time=2714] It means agonizing labor.
[time=2718] It means involvement of the whole person in the cause which he represented.
[time=2723] Paul said he wasn't ashamed to be involved in working, in striving, in laboring, in agonizing.
[time=2731] Over and over again in the writings of Paul, you see these action words which describe his activity for the things of God.
[time=2739] He wasn't looking for some easy road of being involved in a prestigious position that did not involve any work.
[time=2746] But he accepted the challenge from the hand of God to be involved in a ministry that demanded from him everything he had to give and he gave himself to it.
[time=2755] You probably heard about the fella who went down to the corner drug store because he heard that one of his friends who used to be employed there had quit.
[time=2764] He walked into the proprietor and he said, I'm here to inquire about the vacancy that Eddie left when he quit.
[time=2773] The proprietor looked him right in the eye and he said, son, Eddie didn't leave no vacancy.
[time=2779] I'm afraid that that's true in the lives of many Christians.
[time=2784] If they were to walk out of the church they wouldn't leave any vacancy 'cause they don't do anything.
[time=2788] They're not involved in serving God.
[time=2790] They come and they sit and they soak and they sour.
[time=2798] None of that in the Apostle Paul's life, he was involved in serving in agonizing work.
[time=2805] I mentioned earlier today my friend David Peters.
[time=2809] I know David sometimes was criticized for working too hard.
[time=2814] I never knew a man like David who worked like he did.
[time=2818] He was a worker.
[time=2820] And I'll tell you what, we need a recovery of the work ethic in our country today.
[time=2824] We've lost sight of what that meant.
[time=2826] We need a recovery of that in the church because I find myself sometimes when I'm going out to ask people to help get the job done that God has called us to do, trying to figure out ways that I can candy coat the ministry so that it isn't going to be so demanding.
[time=2840] This won't take so much time.
[time=2841] This doesn't ask too much of you.
[time=2843] You won't have to give much of this.
[time=2845] Finally one day when I was reading this passage of scripture, I decided we've had enough of that around here.
[time=2849] I don't know anything that's involving serving God that doesn't demand something of somebody.
[time=2855] And anything that doesn't ask you to do anything and ask you to be involved in anything and require anything of you and cause you to do a little work and striving and agonizing isn't worth being done.
[time=2866] We don't have time to be playing games in the church, trying to make everybody happy because they have a position.
[time=2873] We've got a job to do that God has called us to do.
[time=2875] Paul understood that and he was willing to put in the time and to work.
[time=2880] That's how he served the body.
[time=2882] He strove, he worked, he agonized, he ministered for his body's sake, which is the church.
[time=2889] And notice what the text says.
[time=2894] He did it certainly through the efforts of his body, but according to his working, which worked within me mightily, that's what he said.
[time=2906] How did Paul maintain the schedule?
[time=2907] How was he able to get done the things that needed to be done?
[time=2911] How could he be involved in agonizing and striving and working and touching the lives of so many people because of the mighty working of the person of Christ in his own body, which worked in him mightily, which gave him the strength to do what he could not do humanly?
[time=2926] That's the thing that God has given to us as Christians, something that's beyond human strength.
[time=2931] It is the power of God which resides within us so that when we work, it is a mighty work that touches people and makes a difference in their lives.
[time=2939] Any Christian who tries to do the work of God and the energy of the flesh, losing out on this promise in verse 29, will come to not, will be discouraged and defeated.
[time=2950] But there isn't anything God has called us to do that is not able to be done through the mighty working of his power which worked within us.
[time=2958] So you see men and women, when we think about ministering to the body of Christ, I wouldn't want to go back to the tomb and minister to the body that was laid in the grave, God's given me the opportunity to minister to his body, which is alive and well in the world today through serving and speaking and suffering and striving and being involved with God's people and ministering to them and seeing the body edified and built up.
[time=2980] And that's my job in this dispensation, in this era, to be serving God in such a way that the body of Christ might be glorified and magnified and his name might be praised.
[time=2991] And let me say to you that if you're not serving, if you're not ministering, if you're not having a part in building the body of Christ, you're disobedient and you're missing out on the greatest blessing in your life because that's the thing God has given us to do during this time while we wait for his coming and I believe it soon, shall we pray.
[time=3011] Father, thank you that we can have this opportunity to come together as Christians, as men and women who desire to serve you and to realize that in serving the body of Christ, we are ministering unto thee.
[time=3026] You have told us in thy word that if we do even unto a little child, the things of mercy and grace that we do them unto you in the giving of a cup of cold water, we can minister to Christ.
[time=3038] As we minister to the body of Christ, we minister to Christ himself.
[time=3042] Lord, I thank you today for the privilege of being your servant.
[time=3046] I pray that you will help me to be faithful in ministering in the stewardship you've given to me in my place where I serve.
[time=3053] And I ask dear God that you will touch the lives of men and women, especially today, do we pray for Christians who are in the faith.
