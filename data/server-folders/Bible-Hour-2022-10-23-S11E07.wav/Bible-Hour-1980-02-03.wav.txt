[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=22] [MUSIC]
[time=52] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=71] We welcome you to our service today.
[time=77] Those of you who have gathered here in the auditorium, as you know, this is the second morning service, and this is a very special one in the sense that we invite many friends outside of our church to share with us through television.
[time=89] And so we welcome all of those who have joined us now by way of television to this our morning service.
[time=94] We come into your homes and into your lives with the prayer that God will use this hour to be an encouragement and a blessing to each and every one of you.
[time=104] We're going to listen to the ministry of our choir now as they sing under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger, and they're singing a canticle of praise.
[time=113] [MUSIC]
[time=143] >> We bow with our King, our soul's heart among women,
[time=153] our hearts give thanks to Christ the Lord for victory of the same.
[time=164] We shout for joy.
[time=170] We bow with God the Lord, join in the song,
[time=176] the blessing song of triumph in the light.
[time=184] Brings in praise to thee.
[time=190] We bow by thy name.
[time=195] We praise the Christ who reigns up of his death with thee now
[time=201] our way.
[time=207] We bow with thy King, our soul's heart among women,
[time=215] our hearts give thanks to Christ the Lord for victory of the same.
[time=224] We bow by thy heart to save, for in thy holy creation we cry
[time=240] of God for the brave.
[time=254] >> Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.
[time=258] We thank God for the privilege of praising His name.
[time=261] One of the tremendous opportunities we have as we worship together is to exalt the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and lift Him up.
[time=271] Several years ago we had the privilege of going to the land of Israel to visit the country where the Bible took place in many
[time=280] respects.
[time=281] I have always heard the song.
[time=283] I walked today where Jesus walked but it never meant quite the same to me after I had the privilege of doing that.
[time=291] What a thrill it is to be in the place where the Son of God walked and where His ministry took place.
[time=298] And so every time I hear that song I always think back to some of the experiences we had together.
[time=304] Star Narwhal is going to sing that for us today and I suppose I ought to explain before she sings that she had an accident yesterday and cut her hand so her hand with which she gestures is all bandaged up.
[time=317] And she also explained to me early this morning that she had taken some pain medicine that had done some very strange things to her.
[time=324] So I'm praying that we'll get through this next number and everything will go well.
[time=328] I know it will.
[time=329] God bless you, Star.
[time=331] I walk today where Jesus walked in days of long ago.
[time=358] I wander down each path we knew with reverence, step and so.
[time=370] Those little lanes they have not changed.
[time=377] A sweet peace fills the air.
[time=384] I walked today where Jesus walked and felt His presence there.
[time=403] My pathway led through Bethlehem, all memories ever sweet, the
[time=415] little hills of Galilee that knew those childish feet, the
[time=428] mount of all its hollowed seas that Jesus knew before.
[time=440] I saw the mighty Jordan row, as in the days of your.
[time=459] I knelt today where Jesus knelt, where all alone He prayed.
[time=480] The garden of Gethsemane, my heart felled on a fray.
[time=493] I piqued my heavy burden of, and with Him by my side, I climbed
[time=508] the hill of Calvary, I climbed the hill of Calvary, I climbed the
[time=520] hill of Calvary, where on the cross He died.
[time=536] I walked today where Jesus walked, and felt Him close to me.
[time=564] I really appreciate the fact that you have taken time out of your schedule to join with us in the Bible Hour today.
[time=570] We are happy for the privilege God has given us to come into your homes every week and share with you the Word of God and music that I know is an encouragement to you.
[time=579] I want to say a personal word of appreciation to all of our Founders Club members who regularly
[time=585] support this television ministry, monthly gifts and prayers which come from many of you dear people make the Bible Hour possible.
[time=592] I wish I could mention every one of you by name because you really are part of the inner circle and the family that make the Bible Hour a reality in the places where it's seen.
[time=602] We appreciate you so much and sometimes we let some weeks go by and not say thank you to you and I just wanted to take this moment to express my appreciation and let you know that it's your faithfulness and weekly and monthly commitment that makes the Bible Hour
[time=617] happen.
[time=618] During these last few days we have become very much aware of the fact that people are watching the Bible Hour and places, well places we never dream the Bible Hour could reach.
[time=628] For instance, this past week I got a letter from a young man in prison.
[time=632] I'd like to read a portion of that letter to you because I think it will help you to understand why the ministry of television is such a tremendous investment as we reach out to folks with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=644] In the letter he tells us that someone had given him a copy of our daily Bible study book, The Daily Walk, then he goes on to express that during recent days he had come to know Christ as his Savior and he says it seems very hard to read the Bible and pray but I do want to change my way and do something for the Lord before it's too late.
[time=665] I don't have any money but I do believe that when I get out of here I would like to be a preacher or a teacher.
[time=671] When he said this, would you please pray for me to have more faith and strength?
[time=676] I need someone who wants to help people come close to the Lord.
[time=680] I know that it's not like being in prison with him and being a chaplain or being next to him but men and women the Bible Hour can be that someone to help that young man come closer to the Lord and with the attended materials that we have that we send out along with this program we believe that many new Christians are being helped in their growth.
[time=700] That's why we're so excited about The Daily Walk because it gets people into the Word of God and gives them a systematic method for studying God's truth.
[time=710] The Daily Walk is a very helpful little pamphlet which gives you a schedule for reading through
[time=716] the Bible in a year but it's not just a rote reading, here's a schedule and here's something
[time=722] to read but it's like having a commentary along with you.
[time=726] For instance in this month's issue of The Daily Walk which has a lot to do with the life of Moses in the Old Testament there are charts and explanations that make the Old Testament come alive so that as you read the Word of God you're not just reading it in a vacuum
[time=742] but you're reading it in a context which makes it possible for you to understand and appreciate what you're reading.
[time=747] I'd like to have the opportunity of sending you a free copy of The Daily Walk and if you
[time=754] write to me this week I'll see that you get this month's issue free and postage paid.
[time=760] And along with that I'll tell you how you can become a regular participant in The Daily Walk Ministry receiving this booklet in your home each and every month so that you can stay on schedule and move through the Bible along with the rest of us.
[time=773] If you'll write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 I'll be happy to send
[time=780] you your free copy of The Daily Walk for this month.
[time=784] I hope you'll write and ask for it and get started in reading the Bible along with the rest of us in the year of 1980.
[time=791] Now along with The Daily Walk we have had the privilege in the past months of mailing out many hundreds of copies of a little Bible study help book called The Answer Book.
[time=801] The answer book has been used of God to encourage and help many people across the Bible Our
[time=807] Television Network.
[time=808] Not too long ago we got a letter from a lady who said that she wanted one of these books to be sent to her sister because she had some special need in her life and the verses that she read in The Answer Book were so very helpful.
[time=820] Now The Answer Book is simply a collection of scriptures from the Word of God that are arranged topically.
[time=826] Now it's not just the reference but it's the entire verse written out and arranged in
[time=832] such a way that if you have a particular need you can look in the index, find that need
[time=838] and then find verses that help to meet that need from God's Word.
[time=842] The Answer Book is being used by many people in witnessing, in personal counseling, in personal devotion.
[time=848] I want to share with you that you can't buy that book anyplace.
[time=852] You can only get it through the Bible Our Television Program.
[time=855] It's not available in any bookstores.
[time=857] You cannot get it in any mail order houses.
[time=859] You can only get it through this ministry and it comes to you free and post each page when you write and request it.
[time=865] I hope you'll do that.
[time=867] Write to us today and ask for the Answer Book.
[time=870] Now when you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne,
[time=876] Indiana and ask simply for the Answer Book.
[time=880] Now during the past days we've had a number of folks who have helped us by supporting the Bible Our through what we have called the Sponsors Program, a group of folks who have taken it upon themselves to underwrite the cost of one telecast in their area or associate
[time=895] sponsors who have contributed a hundred dollars toward the cost of the broadcast in their city.
[time=901] We're so very grateful for our sponsors along with the Founders Club.
[time=905] These people are the backbone of the Bible Our Ministry.
[time=908] Today I want to honor an associate sponsor who is helping get the word out in Fort Wayne over Channel 21.
[time=915] The associate sponsor is Ada M. Miller, who is sponsoring the program today in memory of Maggie Taborin, we're so very grateful to Ada Miller for her help in today's ministry.
[time=928] If you'd be interested in being a part of the Sponsors Program we have some dates open now in these next months and we'd like to have you be a part through this special program and if you'll write and ask us how we'll be happy to tell you.
[time=942] Amen and women it's a wonderful thing to be able to preach the Bible and to teach the word of God on television I counted as one of the highest privileges God has given me
[time=952] but it is also a great responsibility and I just want to encourage you as we go back to the service in a few moments that we need your help if we're going to be able to continue doing what God has called us to do.
[time=964] By that I mean we need many of you to pray for us regularly every single day and we need many of you to get behind this ministry financially.
[time=972] We believe that someday God is going to raise up someone who can give a great big major gift
[time=978] to help underwrite some new stations for the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=982] Everywhere I go I meet people who are excited about what we're doing through television and I'm praying that God will lay the burden of this ministry heavily upon the hearts of some folks who can substantially get behind it in the days ahead.
[time=996] We do thank you for what you're doing and we pray that you will keep doing all you can to stand behind us in this ministry and as we join hands together we can literally spread
[time=1006] the word around the world.
[time=1008] Now in just a moment we're going to be opening the Bible again to the book of Colossians and today I want to talk to you about the subject of the preeminence of Christ.
[time=1017] Jesus Christ deserves first place in your life and I hope you'll have your Bibles ready
[time=1023] to join with me as we study the word of God together.
[time=1053] We have had some very exciting times around here recently and if you haven't been around
[time=1069] here on the weekend when our athletic teams are in operation you don't know what excitement is.
[time=1076] I believe at least in my recollection we had our first overtime game last week.
[time=1081] We played the school from Elkhart where my good friend Dan Gillette is the pastor and
[time=1088] lost I think by one point or two points in an overtime and when I got home that night
[time=1094] my wife told me that I had gotten a call from Pastor Gillette and he said to her on occasion
[time=1100] he said I have heard you mention the scores of ball games on your television program and
[time=1106] I just wanted to let you know that it would be alright if you wanted to mention this one.
[time=1113] So I'm kind of in a bind I almost had to tell everyone that we lost and I just like to say to my friends in Elkhart and especially Pastor Gillette that I have announced it and I will also announce it next next year when we have our first senior class and can compete
[time=1128] at the same level.
[time=1134] I've been thinking about that for two days.
[time=1141] Well we have a good time in athletics and we have I'm just so proud of our young people our girls team is undefeated this year and they beat a public school over in Ohio our young men are having an outstanding season and we've got some great personnel in the school that are really developing not only our athletes but the young men and women who serve in that capacity and we thank God for the privilege.
[time=1163] Let's listen now to the music of Dennis and Ron as they share with us a song entitled "Leave Me."
[time=1194] "Leave Me, O Lord, I pray.
[time=1219] Leave Me, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray.
[time=1275] By My side, protest and guide me, I dare not walk alone.
[time=1291] I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray.
[time=1321] Leave Me, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray, O Lord, I pray.
[time=1361] Thank you, men.
[time=1368] Let me remind all of you here in the auditorium and those who are sharing our service by television
[time=1374] here in Fort Wayne that one half hour after this service is over, an episode called "The
[time=1381] Backsters" is viewed here on Channel 21, which is a somewhat controversial program that
[time=1389] creates an issue and then allows people to respond to that issue.
[time=1393] Last week, I videotaped the program that will be shown today and the subject of the program
[time=1399] is homosexuality and the gay rights movement, the purpose for discussion was whether or
[time=1406] not homosexuals should be allowed to teach in schools.
[time=1411] I think you will find it interesting to watch that program and I don't want to take time
[time=1417] to emphasize in this hour any more than to say that we who are Christians and believe
[time=1423] the Word of God know that we have a firm footing upon which to stand and we need not be in doubt about that issue.
[time=1429] It is one that is going to come up more and more in the future and as Christians, we need to be ready to take our stand on what God's Word has to say.
[time=1438] It is one of the greatest threats to our civilization as it stands today and I trust that you'll pray and be encouraged to watch that program today.
[time=1447] Those of you who can't get home from here in time to see it, we will have a videotape of it tonight and after the evening service it will be available for you to view.
[time=1455] Now let's listen to our Minister of Music as he sings a beautiful song that's taken from a verse of Scripture that tells us we're to cast all of our care upon the Lord.
[time=1463] He's singing a song "All Your Anxiety."
[time=1473] Is there a heart or dawn by some will? Is there a life weighed down by fear? Are you a part of the world?.
[time=1499] Now come to the place your birth has been. All Your anxiety be needed in.
[time=1521] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in His wonderful grace and the things of earth will
[time=1541] grow strange me to Him in the light of His glory and grace.
[time=1553] All Your anxiety all Your care bring to the mercy seed we pray.
[time=1569] Never a burden that we cannot bear, never a friend like Jesus.
[time=1586] No soul are you weary and wrong, no light in the darkness you see.
[time=1600] There is life for a look at the Savior and life more abundant than me.
[time=1615] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in His wonderful grace and the things of earth will
[time=1638] grow strange me to Him in the light of His glory and grace.
[time=1651] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in His glory and grace.
[time=1675] Thank you, Don. And that's what we propose to do in these moments.
[time=1679] We turn in our Bibles to the book of Colossians and the first chapter.
[time=1683] Colossians chapter 1 and we're reading together verses 15 through 19.
[time=1690] Colossians chapter 1 verses 15 through 19.
[time=1699] Let us read together. You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1705] Colossians chapter 1 beginning at verse 15.
[time=1709] Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation?
[time=1713] For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible.
[time=1720] Whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by Him and for Him.
[time=1728] And He is before all things and by Him all things consist.
[time=1733] And He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.
[time=1738] That in all things He might have the preeminence.
[time=1741] For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell.
[time=1747] Preparation of our hearts for the message today. I want us to stand together.
[time=1751] Shall we stand please? And we're going to sing in just a moment the chorus that expresses the message of this passage of Scripture.
[time=1760] This passage teaches the preeminence of Christ.
[time=1763] And so let us sing together in preparation of our hearts.
[time=1766] Christ is all I need. Christ is all I need.
[time=1808] Shall we pray together? Our Father, we understand that truth from personal experience.
[time=1816] The preeminence of Christ in our life is something that we have experienced all of us to some degree in some areas.
[time=1823] As we go back to the beginning and understand that truth from a new and different perspective
[time=1829] from the doctrine of Christ's preeminence, we pray that He will not only be glorified
[time=1835] and exalted in our minds, but that He might be firmly established as the center of our living.
[time=1840] To that end we pray as we open thy word today in Jesus' name, and for His sake, amen.
[time=1847] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1852] Over the years as I have listened to messages from the Word of God, I have found that there has been a consistent theme among teachers and preachers on the subjects of the preeminence of Christ.
[time=1864] In Bible conferences and camps and in churches around the country it is consistent to hear from time to time a message on making Christ preeminent in our lives or on the lordship of Christ in the life of the believer.
[time=1879] In some respect, the very subject itself is misunderstood by many who hear such sermons.
[time=1886] For on many occasions I have been led to believe that there was something I could do
[time=1892] by way of my own personal decisions to elevate Christ to a place of preeminence.
[time=1897] The fact of the matter is that Christ is preeminent and there is not anything I can do to change that subject.
[time=1903] He is preeminent because of His person and His work.
[time=1907] Obviously, the plea of the preachers and teachers is that we make Christ in practice what He already is in position.
[time=1915] There is truth in the Word of God that is understood and there is truth in the Word of God that is practiced.
[time=1921] The Bible teaches clearly that Christ is preeminent.
[time=1925] It behooves every Christian to take that doctrinal truth and translate it into duty.
[time=1930] You will discover as you read the book of Colossians that that's exactly what Paul is trying to do.
[time=1935] As in many of his other writings, he lays a doctrinal foundation.
[time=1939] In today's passage of Scripture, the foundation is the preeminence of Christ in all of the world.
[time=1945] The rest of the book then takes that truth and translates it into everyday life.
[time=1950] He is preeminent because he is declared to be such, but he must be preeminent not only in doctrine but in duty.
[time=1957] He is to have first place in our families and in our fellowship and in our factories.
[time=1962] He is to be first in our lives.
[time=1965] But it is a very unfortunate thingmen and women when we try to build duty on a shallow foundation.
[time=1971] It is not enough for us to stand up and exhort and give do's and don'ts without a proper, biblical and doctrinal foundation.
[time=1979] Paul understood that and so should we.
[time=1982] And so today we are going to lay the foundation for the preeminence of Christ.
[time=1986] This passage which I have read from the first chapter is the beginning of the body of the letter.
[time=1992] We have looked already at the introduction and we have studied together the prayer that is contained in Paul's letter.
[time=1999] Now today Paul begins the actual body of his letter and the truth that he is explaining to the Colossians.
[time=2006] This doctrine of the preeminence of Christ which fills these few verses which we have read is not a new doctrine to Paul.
[time=2014] He has taught it and preached it before. He has written it in other letters.
[time=2018] It is found in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18 and in chapters 4 verses 4 through 6.
[time=2025] It is one of the great truths of the book of Philippians in that which we call the great kenosis passage in Philippians chapter 2
[time=2033] where Jesus Christ is exalted to be Lord above all.
[time=2037] But here in the book of Colossians we see Paul taking this doctrine of the preeminence of Christ and developing it fully
[time=2044] so that all of us can understand and appreciate its truth.
[time=2048] Now his proof is along three lines.
[time=2051] First of all he declares that Jesus Christ is preeminent or first because of his relationship with the Father God.
[time=2058] Secondly he reminds us that Jesus Christ is first because of his relationship to the created universe.
[time=2065] And thirdly he shows us the preeminence of Christ because of his headship to the church.
[time=2071] Now before we go into the text it is important for us to understand that Paul is not only declaring a positive truth,
[time=2078] the preeminence of Christ, but he is using this opportunity as a defense against heresy that had grown up among the Colossians.
[time=2087] For as we learned earlier in our study of this book there were those among the Colossian believers who were teaching that there needed to be an understanding on the part of those believers of the dichotomy between good and evil
[time=2100] and between the spiritual and the material.
[time=2103] The Gnostic heretics taught that good and evil were associated with the spiritual and the material.
[time=2110] And therefore they came about a tremendous problem in trying to explain the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2116] For they could understand his goodness in the spiritual realm, but since he was claiming and since the apostle claimed and taught that he was a man,
[time=2125] the Gnostics could not explain his humanity because humanity according to the Gnostics was evil, that matter was not good.
[time=2134] They went about this in a very exacting yet mysterious way.
[time=2140] They started with a group of what they called emanations.
[time=2143] Here was God the Father up here and here was man down here.
[time=2147] And in order to make place for evil in the universe they brought the emanations down little by little step by step from God the Father all the way down to the earth where man was.
[time=2159] And in order to make a place for Jesus Christ in their system, they made Jesus Christ a part of the eons or the emanations and brought him down almost to the lower structure of their system.
[time=2171] They said in essence that Jesus Christ was a created being and that he was not sinlessly perfect since he had a body and the only way they could make room for him in the universe was to make him one of the rungs in the ladder of emanations from good to evil.
[time=2187] It was to that point that Paul wrote this section of the book for he is declaring that Jesus Christ is not one among many nor is he a degradation from God to the universe but he is first and he is first by reason of his person and by reason of his work.
[time=2206] The first thing that Paul teaches us about Jesus Christ is this that he is first because of his person or because of his relationship with Father God.
[time=2216] Now it says in the text that Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God.
[time=2222] Now what does that mean?
[time=2224] Well the word image is a very interesting word and deserving of an entire study on its own. It is the word icon.
[time=2233] The word icon it means a picture, a representation, a replica, a revelation of.
[time=2241] The text says that Jesus Christ is the picture, the replica, the revelation of God.
[time=2247] We have in our writings today a record of a letter that was written on papyrus back in the time of the Bible.
[time=2256] It was a letter written from a soldier lad called Appian to his father Epimicus.
[time=2262] And in the letter near the end of the letter is this statement as he is writing to his father Epimicus.
[time=2268] He says I send you a little portrait, Iconian, I send you a little portrait of myself painted by Euchteman.
[time=2278] A little portrait and the word is Iconian, a picture, a representation of.
[time=2287] And so the meaning of the image of the invisible God is that Jesus Christ is the picture of God.
[time=2295] He is the revelation of God to man.
[time=2298] Now if you have a hard time understanding and remembering the word Icon, if you'll go to any photographic store in the city you will be able to find a certain kind of camera which is called an Icon.
[time=2309] And that particular kind of camera gets its name right out of the Bible for the word Icon means a picture, a representation, a presentation, a revelation of.
[time=2320] So the Bible says that Jesus Christ is a picture of God.
[time=2324] Still yet beyond this meaning which is found in history there is another meaning.
[time=2329] For it is understood by historians that when two people in the time of Christ would come together
[time=2335] to solemnly declare their allegiance by means of a document when they would sign an agreement such as an IOU or as a receipt
[time=2344] that was necessary for them to make in that document a description of both parties.
[time=2349] That description would be the characteristics of each person entering into the document.
[time=2354] All of their characteristics, their features, etc.
[time=2357] So that if there was any dispute there would be a description of both parties.
[time=2361] That particular part of the document was called an Icon, the description of the parties.
[time=2368] So when the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the image of God what it is teaching us is that Jesus Christ is God's revelation, his picture of himself to man.
[time=2378] The Bible says no man has ever seen God, he is the invisible God.
[time=2383] God is spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[time=2388] So how could a mankind like us who understand nothing about spirit beings know God?
[time=2393] Well we have much for which to be thankful for God has sent us a picture of himself in the person of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2400] Jesus Christ is the revelation of God to man.
[time=2403] That is why when Jesus was accosted on occasion by his friends and they said to him show us the Father.
[time=2410] Jesus said without ever stopping for a moment if you have seen me you have seen the Father.
[time=2416] For Jesus Christ was God's revelation of himself to man and right that it should be because he was God himself.
[time=2423] Jesus Christ was God in the flesh, God revealing himself to man.
[time=2428] That is why in all of our churches where the Bible is preached we preach Jesus Christ.
[time=2433] We uplift Jesus Christ, we glorify Jesus Christ.
[time=2437] For Jesus Christ is God's revelation of himself to man.
[time=2442] That's why we read in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 that God who in sundry times and in diverse manner spoke to us in times passed by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us how by his own son.
[time=2456] Jesus Christ is God's message to man.
[time=2459] That's why we read in John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was God and the word was with God and the word was God.
[time=2467] And the word word is the word logos which means an expression.
[time=2472] Jesus Christ is the expression of God to man.
[time=2476] So when you come to know Jesus Christ men and women you come to know God.
[time=2480] For Jesus Christ is both God and the expression of the Father to all of us.
[time=2485] Now in the same passage of scripture there is another word which is used to describe who Jesus Christ really is.
[time=2492] It is the word found in the 19th verse it is the word play Roma.
[time=2497] Jesus Christ is the fullness of God.
[time=2500] That means that Jesus Christ is not just a sketch of who God is but Jesus Christ is all that God is.
[time=2507] He is God in the flesh.
[time=2510] When I go out to witness and tell people about Jesus Christ and I begin to talk to them about the Lord on occasion I will ask them this question.
[time=2518] Who in your opinion is Jesus Christ?
[time=2520] Quite often they will say He is the Son of God.
[time=2523] And then I will ask them this question for clarification.
[time=2526] Is Jesus Christ the Son of God in any different way than I am the Son of my Father?
[time=2531] Usually there is a question that comes to their face.
[time=2534] For most people though they have never thought it out completely recognize that the relationship of Jesus Christ to His Father is on a level far above the relationship that we have to our earthly Father though they don't know what it is.
[time=2547] Here it is explained Jesus Christ is both the image and the fullness of God.
[time=2552] He is God's picture to man.
[time=2554] He is God in the flesh so that mankind can know and relate to God in heaven.
[time=2559] That's what Paul is saying. He is saying to these who would bring Jesus Christ down to their level, no you can't do that.
[time=2567] Jesus Christ is not one among many. He is God of God's.
[time=2571] He is the expression of the Father and because of that He deserves preeminence in your mind and in your thinking and in your life.
[time=2578] Over and over again this truth is taught and lifted up in this great book.
[time=2584] Hebrews chapter 1 verse 3 tells us that He is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of His person.
[time=2593] He is the Shekinah glory of God and the express picture of God.
[time=2598] If you want to know God you must come to know Jesus Christ for Christ is the only way to know God.
[time=2605] And men and women you may be surprised to learn this that even when we spend eternity in heaven it will still be so that Jesus Christ is the God that we see.
[time=2614] No man will see the spirit for the spirit is not revealed but Jesus Christ is the revelation of the Father.
[time=2621] So it behooves every one of us to take note of this great truth and if we do not know Christ to recognize that apart from knowing Christ you cannot know God.
[time=2631] For Christ is God's only picture of Himself only revelation of Himself only representation of Himself to mankind.
[time=2641] And that's why Paul does not blush in the least bit to say that God has revealed Himself through His Son Jesus Christ who is the image of God the first born of all creation.
[time=2654] But secondly he goes into this area. He says Jesus Christ is preeminent because of His relationship with the universe.
[time=2662] Now you remember that I said in the beginning that the Gnostics taught that Jesus Christ was a created being.
[time=2668] Paul contradicts this truth in the strongest possible language.
[time=2672] He says in essence Jesus Christ is not a created being. He is Himself the Creator.
[time=2678] He is not someone who has been created by God in heaven at the lower end of a long ladder of Aons but He is Himself the prime mover in the universe.
[time=2687] In this passage of scripture four times He uses the word all things and in that expression He describes the all encompassing force of the creation of Jesus Christ.
