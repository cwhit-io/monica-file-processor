[time=18] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=29] [ Singing ]
[time=59] [MUSIC]
[time=72] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=74] >> We begin our services by bringing praise and honor and glory
[time=83] to the greatness of our great God.
[time=86] Because all that we do and attempt to do here is for the purpose of glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible tells us that if we lift up Christ, he will draw all men unto himself.
[time=97] And so every time we meet, it is our purpose to lift up and exalt the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=104] We begin our service that way to set the tone for all that we do in the moments that follow.
[time=110] We continue in our praise to the Lord Jesus as we listen to the ministry of our choir, singing for us crown him with many crowns.
[time=120] [MUSIC]
[time=128] [ Singing ]
[time=287] >> Thank you, choir, for leading us in worship.
[time=293] We appreciate the ministry of our choir each week as they lift up to the heights and majesty of choral music.
[time=300] We also appreciate the individuals and groups who minister to us in all of the services here.
[time=306] They're part of us, they're part of our church family, they are part of the ministry team here, and two that we always appreciate are the Petersons.
[time=315] And they're going to sing for us now, listen carefully to their ministry in music.
[time=320] [MUSIC]
[time=328] >> A song was born when I met Jesus,
[time=337] and in my heart he came to stay,
[time=345] and the reason I sing is that he saved me.
[time=355] In my life he gave me.
[time=360] Now I walk his way, just like the sun.
[time=369] I just prayed a time for him.
[time=373] He filled my life with you in a moment's time.
[time=383] A song was born, and it's made the dish of me and my soul.
[time=397] He turned away.
[time=401] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=435] Just like the sun was on a springtime night.
[time=443] He filled my life with you in a moment's time.
[time=455] A song was born, and it's made the dish of me and my soul.
[time=469] He turned away.
[time=474] [MUSIC]
[time=479] >> Thank you so much for joining us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=484] We're privileged to bring this television program into your home, and we counted a very special privilege to take these few moments during the midst of the telecast to share with you personally.
[time=494] Donna, my wife, and I both look forward to this time when we can share with you the things that are important to the television ministry.
[time=500] Donna, we have some very special things to talk about today.
[time=504] I want to take just a moment to share again the details of this Bible study program.
[time=509] Why don't you share with our friends at home the general nature of our Bible study program and how it works.
[time=517] The Daily Walk is a little booklet that comes into your home every month, and it gives you a portion of Scripture to read each day so that you have a continuous study of the Bible on a daily basis,
[time=529] and it gives you the assigned portion to read, and then it has a brief explanation of what you have read to help you understand it.
[time=536] The Daily Walk, for instance, for the month of March is a very exciting Old Testament study
[time=542] that takes you into the book of Joshua and Samuel, and you will find that it's a great help to understand what's in this book
[time=549] by just opening it up and reading the commentaries that go with each of the chapters that are assigned,
[time=555] beginning in the book of Joshua, moving all the way through the book to the end of 1 Samuel.
[time=560] You will have an assignment for each day, you will have some commentary on each assignment that you read and a practical application to your own life.
[time=568] You will also find many charts that help to put the various sections of the Scripture together for you.
[time=574] The Daily Walk is a plan to help you read the Bible consecutively.
[time=579] Most people I know know they ought to read the Bible, know that it would be helpful to them if they would, but don't have a plan to get it done, and most of us have discovered that without a plan, we really don't seem to get anything accomplished as the old adage goes if we fail to plan, we have planned to fail,
[time=596] and this helps you to make a plan every day so that by the end of the year you will have read through the entire Scripture.
[time=602] Now, the Daily Walk is one of the ways that we extend the ministry of the Bible hour into your home.
[time=607] We'd like to send you your free copy of the March edition of the Daily Walk if you'll get in touch with us,
[time=613] and in order to do that you need to go to your phone and call this special toll-free number.
[time=620] It is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=625] Once again, 1-800-453-9000, tell the Bible hour operator that you'd like your free copy of the March edition of the Daily Walk,
[time=634] and it will be sent to you this week.
[time=636] Now along with that, honey, we have some other things that we like to make available to our friends, Bible study commentaries,
[time=642] and this month we have a very special offer that you wanted to share with our friends at home.
[time=647] Our book that we're offering this month is called Questions People Are Asking, and it is written by Dr. James T. Jeremiah, my father-in-law, and it covers questions that are pertinent to our lives today,
[time=662] such as, "Should you ever put self first? Are there things that are definitely wrong in this world?"
[time=670] A lot of times people say, "There aren't any specifics that you can say, 'This is wrong.'"
[time=676] And this booklet tells us if there really are some things that we can say, there's no question about it, they are wrong.
[time=682] And if you would like to have your copy of the booklet Questions People Are Asking or the Daily Walk,
[time=689] you just need to pick up your telephone and call our toll-free number, which is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=697] Ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like the booklets offered on today's broadcast.
[time=704] Now while we're talking to our friends at home and before we go back to our morning service, let me remind all of them that most of them, at least, who are receiving our mail regularly, have received a letter from me not too long ago explaining a special project that we're working on right now
[time=718] to get the Bible Hour up on its feet and ready to go into expansion.
[time=722] I hope if you've received your letter that you've taken time to respond.
[time=726] Once again, I want to encourage you that we need your help at this time, and I hope many of you who have yet to write to us will sit down today and be a part of making the Bible Hour a success in your area.
[time=737] In every area where it is seen, we need your help if we're to stay on the air during these coming months.
[time=743] Once again, if you'd like to have your free copy of the Daily Walk or this special book, Questions People Are Asking, you need to go to your phone and dial 1-800-453-9000.
[time=755] It's a toll-free number. It doesn't cost you anything to dial that number and receive the Bible Hour Operator at the other end.
[time=763] Give her the information about that which you want and we'll send it to you this week.
[time=767] We also want you to know that you can reach us through the mail by writing to us.
[time=771] Donna, before we go back to the service, make sure they understand how to do that.
[time=775] I just need to write to Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=783] 46815, and we love to receive your letters and to hear from you about how God's working in your life.
[time=790] As we go back to the service now, we'll be opening our Bibles to the Book of Colossians, and I'm going to speak this morning on the subject of spoiled Christians.
[time=798] If you wonder what that's all about, I hope you'll stay with us as we join together in the study of God's Word.
[time=828] [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=908] Thank you, Dennis. Let's take our hymnals now and turn them to hymn number 425,
[time=916] and sing a few stanzas of "My Faith Looks Up to Thee," hymn number 425.
[time=924] Shall we all stand as we sing together?
[time=929] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=1005] Thank you for the good singing, and you may be seated.
[time=1010] A beautiful new contemporary song that I'm sure has grown to be your favorite as well as mine
[time=1016] is the song that Ron Hackett, fresh from the Caribbean, sings for us right now.
[time=1022] It's entitled "Through It All." [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=1247] Thank you Ron.
[time=1248] There are a number of songs that have special meaning to us because of experiences that we have had.
[time=1254] The song that Ron just finished has a very special place in my life because at a time when I was going through some difficulties.
[time=1261] In my own life I discovered that song and I remember playing it over and over and over again in the cassette player in my car.
[time=1270] And God used that in a very special way to encourage my heart and so every time I hear it I'm reminded again that of its truth.
[time=1278] It works and sometimes God puts us through some things to teach us that we can depend upon him.
[time=1284] The Lord's Prayer is one of the favorite portions of the Word of God. It is often repeated in assemblies like this one today.
[time=1293] I don't believe I've ever heard it set to more dynamic music than the setting which is ours as we listen to our men singers remind us of the truth of this great, great petition which is in the Bible.
[time=1314] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1504] Thank you, man. That was exciting. Amen.
[time=1512] I want you to open your Bibles to the book of Colossians in the second chapter.
[time=1517] While you're finding your way to Colossians, I want to answer a question that I've been asked about 40 times today since I came to church.
[time=1526] Yes, my sister is the basketball coach at the University of Dayton in Ohio.
[time=1532] Yesterday between the half-time of the Notre Dame Dayton game on national television, they introduced and interviewed Dr. Mary Alice Jeremiah.
[time=1541] And my phone rang off the hook, are you watching this? Is this your sister? Yes, it is my sister.
[time=1546] I am so proud of her.
[time=1548] She just has done so very well. Her team is number one in the country in girls basketball.
[time=1554] In college, girls basketball division two, they're 27 and two going into the tournaments and have a very good possibility of winning the national championship.
[time=1563] And so in between that, the half-time of that ball game, they talked to her.
[time=1567] And is she fired up? I'll tell you what, she is ready to go.
[time=1572] And I just am kind of proud of her. She's two years younger than I am and was a constant source of irritation to me while I was growing up.
[time=1584] For every one trophy, I ever won an athletic, she won ten.
[time=1589] And I never walked by her room and looked in the door because my ego just went like that every time, but I am proud of her.
[time=1595] And she is having more fun with the Bible study with her team players than about anything else.
[time=1603] Every one of her basketball players have been in a personal Bible study with her during this past year.
[time=1608] Some of them have come to know Christ as their savior.
[time=1611] And it's just really neat to see what God has done with her life.
[time=1614] I really didn't need to say that, but I wanted to brag on her a little bit, so I thought I would.
[time=1618] Colossians chapter two, beginning at verse eight.
[time=1622] Beware, lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
[time=1633] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power, in whom also ye have, in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, and putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism, in which also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead, and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
[time=1665] hath he made alive together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.
[time=1670] Let us pray together.
[time=1672] Father in heaven, we are grateful that we may come into thy presence.
[time=1677] We are mindful of the pattern of prayer which we have just had rehearsed before us,
[time=1684] that we are to come as unto a hallowed Father,
[time=1690] and that we are to pray that his kingdom be accomplished, that his will and his sovereignty be experienced.
[time=1698] All of the various parts of that great prayer should find their way into our prayer ministry,
[time=1704] and we are grateful for the teaching on prayer from the life of our Lord Jesus.
[time=1710] We come unto thee now, asking for thy presence with us in this moment.
[time=1716] We recognize that the promises ours that were two or three are gathered together, there are thou in the midst, and we sense thy presence.
[time=1724] We say without apology thou art welcome, O God, in this assembly, both in the indwelling of our hearts and in the indwelling of this meeting.
[time=1735] We pray that we shall sense the presence of the Lord in a very special way, for we pray in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior, amen.
[time=1749] One of the dramatic experiences in my mind is the experience that took place one day in a very informal setting while I was a student at Dallas Theological Seminary.
[time=1762] It happened in the snack bar in an encounter with a young man
[time=1769] who was at the very top intellectually of my particular class.
[time=1776] He came in with the highest academic records of all the class and was at the very top of the echelon as far as academic markings were concerned.
[time=1788] I know that because I looked up to him in that respect.
[time=1793] He was a brilliant young man, and his questions even in class would not necessarily because he wanted them to be, but because it was quite obvious, his questions gave away his intelligence.
[time=1805] He asked questions I didn't even know how to ask.
[time=1810] My encounter with him that day in the snack room can only be understood in light of the situation which is his right now.
[time=1819] And so before I tell you what we talked about that day, I want to tell you what he is doing now.
[time=1825] He is divorced from his wife, he has left his family, he is not in the ministry,
[time=1833] he is teaching in a secular university, living a life of hedonism without any commitment whatsoever to absolutes, does not believe in the existence of God,
[time=1844] has literally thrown his life away as we would understand it, though he enrolled in the same seminary I went to with the purpose of becoming a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1857] What did we talk about that day in the snack room?
[time=1861] He told me that because he was required to take some remedial courses, he had enrolled in a state university and had always been somewhat enamored with philosophy.
[time=1871] And so he took all of the courses in philosophy that he could get at that state university.
[time=1876] And he said the more I studied philosophy, the more excited I got, and that day as we talked together while he was still a student, he said I have serious questions based upon my study in philosophy about the reality of the Christian faith and about the reality of Jesus Christ.
[time=1893] He said the more I study philosophy, the more questions I have, and the more questions I have, the fewer answers I have, and he said I'm just unburdening my heart to you, and he said I wouldn't want this to go out of this room, and at that point in time I didn't say a thing to anyone.
[time=1907] But I want you to know that I wonder sometimes if I really belong here, I'm thinking very seriously about my commitment to Christ.
[time=1915] I talked with him and tried to encourage him, but I was certainly no match for his reasoning.
[time=1920] I've thought about that experience since that time to this day, and I've asked myself a number of questions.
[time=1926] Was it that Christianity could not stand the test of the questions of philosophy
[time=1932] that were thrown at him by the secular professors?
[time=1935] And as I've pondered that, I've discounted that, that couldn't be true, because men of much greater intellect, even than my friend Ron, have quested the Christian faith and have asked questions of it harder than any questions we've ever dreamed of, and they have come out at the place of Christianity as the position of truth.
[time=1956] No, it could not be just the questions asked by the secular professors at that state university. That wasn't the only thing involved.
[time=1965] Could it be that while he was studying at the secular university, he became carnal in his pursuits, and he left off his faith from the standpoint of a daily walk with the Lord, no longer fellowshipping with Jesus Christ in prayer and through the reading of the Word of God?
[time=1979] That could possibly be true.
[time=1982] What caused this young man who started out in the direction of serving Christ to turn his back upon it all and go into a totally different direction, just annihilating his family life and all of the things that were important to him at one time, what caused that to happen?
[time=2000] I believe that Paul has something to say to us about that particular problem in the passage we have just read.
[time=2007] In fact, if I could put a visual picture in your mind today, I would do it with the one word which begins our study.
[time=2014] It is the word beware.
[time=2018] If Paul could paint a picture for us on the canvas of our hearts today, he would take that one word beware and etch it across a long sign and stick it down in the ground at the entrance to the realm of philosophy and he would say to us, beware.
[time=2034] In order to understand the danger that is involved in that pursuit, let me explain to you first of all what philosophy is.
[time=2043] The word is made up of two words, fillejo and sofism.
[time=2047] Fillejo meaning love and sofism meaning wisdom.
[time=2051] So philosophy is the love of wisdom.
[time=2054] A philosopher is a lover of wisdom.
[time=2058] There is not anything wrong with wisdom.
[time=2060] The Bible extols it as a great virtue if it is wisdom after God.
[time=2064] But the Bible tells us there is two kinds of wisdom.
[time=2067] There is the wisdom which is of God and the wisdom which is of men.
[time=2072] And a philosopher is a man who is a lover of the wisdom of men.
[time=2080] And Paul says at the beginning of verse 8, beware lest any man spoil you
[time=2087] through philosophy.
[time=2090] Now how is a person spoiled through philosophy?
[time=2094] And what is wrong with philosophy in the first place?
[time=2097] What I'd like to share with you some of the dangers that are inherent in a person who loves the wisdom of men.
[time=2106] The first thing that is quite obvious by the very use of the word spoil is the fact that this kind of philosophy has captivating power.
[time=2115] Now the word spoil is not the kind of spoil that happens when you turn your refrigerator off by accident and leave it that way for a couple of days.
[time=2124] It's not spoil in that it becomes rotten, but it's the kind of spoil that happens when in a military campaign we learn the term to the victor belongs the spoils.
[time=2135] That means to carry away that which is left.
[time=2138] The word spoil is a word which means to carry away.
[time=2142] So if we read that in the text Paul is saying do not let any man carry you away through philosophy.
[time=2150] Have you ever heard it said of anyone who gets involved in some pet project, he just got carried away with it.
[time=2158] That's what he's talking about.
[time=2160] He's saying it's possible that a person can become so enamored with the love of the wisdom of man
[time=2167] that he can just get carried away with the whole thing.
[time=2170] He can be captivated by it.
[time=2172] Have you ever known anybody like that?
[time=2174] Who went to school or went to a seminar or went to a weekend thing or got under some certain kind of teacher.
[time=2180] And all of a sudden you wonder what's happened to that person.
[time=2183] They just got carried away with that whole thing.
[time=2187] Paul says one of the dangers that is inherent in the pursuit of the wisdom of man
[time=2194] is that it is possible for a person to be captivated by that drive in his own life.
[time=2199] And the Bible teaches us as Christians that anything which makes us captive or enslaves us
[time=2205] is wrong for us apart from the enslaving of Christ as we come to him in bond service.
[time=2213] So I would say to you that in the very term spoil we have an inherent danger, it can captivate the mind of a person.
[time=2221] The second thing that we learn in this text is that it is dangerous because it is empty in its content.
[time=2228] You notice that he uses as a parallel expression of philosophy the term vain deceit.
[time=2236] Vane meaning empty, deceit meaning without truth.
[time=2240] Emptiness without truth.
[time=2244] There is a kind of scenario that takes place in the pursuit of the wisdom of men.
[time=2250] That is very difficult to describe but in an attempt to describe it,
[time=2256] something like the experience you have when you go places to hear some learned person speak
[time=2262] and when you get done you have the feeling that you don't know what they said but you surely do like the way they said it.
[time=2271] You could not for a moment put down on a piece of paper the content of what was explained or said but there was such a good feeling in your heart all the time you were listening to it.
[time=2280] You liked what they said.
[time=2284] Paul uses that kind of an expression to warn us again in the fourth verse of the same chapter.
[time=2290] He says, "I say this lest any man should be guile you with enticing words."
[time=2297] Paul said it is possible for a person to be captivated in the very words that a person uses to get their attention.
[time=2305] I have been in situations when I have heard people give marvelous addresses
[time=2311] and when they got all done I walked out feeling that was one of the most marvelous experiences until I began to look at my notes and realize that they said a lot of things that weren't true but they said them nicely.
[time=2324] It is possible for a person to captivate us by their tremendous ability as an orator
[time=2331] or the tremendous use of verbiage and we listen to it and we say, "My, that sounds profound."
[time=2340] I have over the years kept a little diary of some of those experiences I'd like to share just a couple with you to illustrate what I'm talking about.
[time=2349] Listen to the profundity of this expression.
[time=2353] Cintillate, scintillate, globule vivific.
[time=2360] Fane would I fathom by nature specific.
[time=2365] Softily poised in the ether capacious, strongly resembling a gem carbonaceous,
[time=2373] which being translated in our language is twinkle, twinkle, little star.
[time=2378] How I wonder.
[time=2381] The one is the wisdom of words and the other is the content.
[time=2387] No, it sounds great to use all those big words and you're impressed and you say, "My, what an intellectual person."
[time=2395] You get all done. You ask yourself the question, "What did he say?" Was it the truth?
[time=2405] Two long ago I came across this little article describing what happened in an advertising firm
[time=2415] that the person was asked to write a description for ivory soap.
[time=2420] This is what he sent down to the copy editor.
[time=2423] The alkaline elements and vegetable fat in this product are blended in such a way as to secure the highest quality of saponification alone.
[time=2432] With a specific gravity that keeps it on top of the water, relieving the bather of the trouble and annoyance of fishing around for it in the bottom of the bathtub during his ablutions.
[time=2444] And the editor wrote over the paragraph, "It floats."
[time=2452] Now the question that we ask is this, "Are we interested in being impressed with the wisdom of words or are we interested in getting at the truth?"
[time=2463] Paul says, "Beware, lest any man entice you with enticing words and carry you away, examine what he says."
[time=2472] Oh, it's good to say it well.
[time=2474] But examine what he says. You know what I've discovered about the Bible?
[time=2478] I've discovered the Bible is a very simple book.
[time=2482] I found this this week that you know that there are 810,697 words used in the Bible, but only 6,000 different words.
[time=2492] That the average length of these words is 5 letters.
[time=2497] The message of Christianity is a message of simplicity.
[time=2502] Only man has enabled the message to become complicated and muddied up.
[time=2508] You probably heard about the woman who went to church and on the way out.
[time=2511] She was talking to her friend and she said, "My, didn't he go down deep today?"
[time=2517] And her friend said, "Yes, and my, didn't he stay down long today?"
[time=2525] And then her friend said, "Yes, and didn't he come up dry today?" You go down deep, you stay down long, and you come up dry.
[time=2534] God's message is the message of simplicity.
[time=2538] You must be born again.
[time=2540] And yet in its simplicity it is profound.
[time=2543] Now Paul says there's a problem with philosophy in that it is empty in its content.
[time=2550] It is vain deceit.
[time=2552] And I challenge you.
[time=2554] There's not anything wrong with learning all we can learn from the wisdom of men.
[time=2558] But what does it say?
[time=2560] Is it true?
[time=2561] That's the question.
[time=2563] The third thing that he says is a problem with philosophy is that it is after the tradition of men.
[time=2571] Turning your Bibles to Mark chapter 5.
[time=2576] Mark chapter 5 where our Lord has something to say about tradition.
[time=2582] Mark chapter 7, I'm sorry, Mark 7 verses 7 through 9.
[time=2589] It says in Mark 7 verse 7, "However, in vain do they worship me,
[time=2596] teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, for laying aside the commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men
[time=2603] as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things ye do." And he said unto them, "Full well you reject the commandment of God that ye may keep your own tradition."
[time=2617] Paul said to the people in Colossae, "You need to be careful that you don't become so enamored with philosophy because of its antiquity. It has come down through the history and it is after the tradition of men
[time=2629] and somehow our reasoning process goes why it has to be true, it's been around so long."
[time=2636] Do you know air is as old as the Garden of Eden, isn't it?
[time=2642] It's as old as the first lie told in the Garden of Eden.
[time=2645] It is the tradition of air that has been passed down through the ages generation after generation.
[time=2654] And it is possible to come to the place in one's life where they become so enamored with the philosophy of tradition
[time=2660] that they replace truth with tradition.
[time=2665] You say, "Pastor, is that alive and well today?" You better believe it.
[time=2669] One of the most astounding things to me is a pastor. As I move about in our city, in this area,
[time=2676] I meet hundreds of people many times through the ministry of the television program.
[time=2681] And I have found in almost every branch of denominational Christianity men and women of God
[time=2689] who believe this book, who accept Christ as their personal Savior, who want to serve God with all of their hearts, who are committed to the truths we're committed to.
[time=2699] And then they tell me they're going to a church that doesn't believe what the Bible teaches.
[time=2704] That does not believe that Jesus Christ was divine, that does not accept God's plan for the future,
[time=2711] does not accept the blood atonement, ridicules the things that we hold dear.
[time=2715] And here are these God-loving Bible-believing people going to those churches when they're in the very scenario of that which denies the things they claim to believe.
[time=2725] And you know, I asked them when they tell me they're believers and they're involved in that, "Well, where did you say you go?" And then they sort of get embarrassed and they say this, "Well, you know, pastor, my great-grandfather went there, and my grandfather went there, and my father went there, and I was baptized there,
[time=2748] and I grew up there, and I suppose I'll die there. God help you."
[time=2755] Because a person who was allowed that to happen in their life has taken the tradition and replaced it where the truth belongs.
[time=2764] They have said, "Here's the tradition. I live for that tradition.
[time=2768] Here's the truth. I know the truth, but I've let the tradition become the truth."
[time=2776] I know I'm going to make some folks angry by what I've said.
[time=2779] I want to tell you something. If I was going to a church as a believer that did not teach and believe and practice what this book says, I would get out of that church and find one that did.
[time=2793] Paul said it's possible for you to get in trouble with philosophy because it is after the tradition of men.
[time=2800] And then he says it is after the rudiments of the world.
[time=2805] It is after the rudiments of the world.
[time=2808] By that he means it is according to the elements, and here he's referring again to that whole system that we talked about earlier in our discussion of the book of Colossians, the system between God and man, made up of all of these little elements.
[time=2822] And he said, "Philosophy deals with the elemental things." Paul is really striking a death blow to philosophy.
[time=2829] He's saying they think they're dealing with the real thing, but they're dealing with the elements of the world.
[time=2834] They're dealing with the ABCs.
[time=2837] They haven't come to grips with the truth at all.
[time=2839] They're still grappling around with the ABCs and what it's all about.
[time=2845] And then he says it is wrong because, according to this verse, it is not after Christ.
[time=2851] And that's enough for me, not after Christ.
[time=2854] What's your measuring stick, my friend?
[time=2857] What do you use to measure that doctrine you study?
[time=2862] The Bible says that the measuring stick is Christ.
[time=2866] You say, "Well, Pastor Jeremiah, that's your presupposition." You start with that. That's right, I do.
[time=2874] Jesus Christ is my major and minor premise, my presupposition.
[time=2879] I start with him.
[time=2882] And before you poke your finger of fun in my face, let me ask you, what is your presupposition?
[time=2891] Yours is the collected wisdom of humanity, the fallible reasonings of a man without the inside of his maker.
[time=2902] That's your presupposition. Give me Christ any day.
[time=2906] He's my measuring stick and all truth must be measured against the truth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2912] And anything that is not after Christ, not according to Christ does not fit the scheme of Christ.
[time=2917] That must be rejected, because all truth is God's truth.
[time=2923] And Jesus Christ said, "I am the way, I am the truth."
[time=2933] So if it's not after Christ, you can just forget it.
[time=2937] It doesn't belong to the truth of God.
[time=2941] Now, that's what's wrong with philosophy.
[time=2943] And I don't want to leave us there because it's not good to leave on a negative note.
[time=2948] Paul says in verse 8, "Some powerful things," he says, "Beware, don't get spoiled or carried away by the philosophy of men and the empty deceit." That's tradition and the rudiments of the world and does not fit the scheme of Christ.
[time=2963] And then he gives to us what's wrong with philosophy and now what's right with Christ.
[time=2969] Why should we be committed to Christ as the yardstick of our lives and reasoning?
[time=2974] Well, I wish we had time to go through all the detail of these next few verses.
[time=2977] But let me give you the key that unlocks the passage.
[time=2980] It's a little phrase that is here in the text, it is the phrase "in him."
[time=2986] And if you will notice that wherever you find it in the text, it gives to us the reasons why Christ is the antithesis to the worldly wisdom of men.
[time=2996] First of all, notice, "in him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[time=3004] Why is Jesus Christ the measuring stick?
[time=3007] Because all truth is resident in him.
[time=3011] That passage says that in Christ, in the person of Jesus Christ is at home.
[time=3017] The word "dwell" means is at home.
[time=3019] All of the Godhead bodily.
[time=3023] In the person of Jesus Christ is resident, all that is.
[time=3028] God himself, the source of all truth, is in him as a person.
[time=3034] Now, why do I need to be dabbling around in philosophy when I'm related to the ultimate source?
[time=3042] I don't need all the reasonings of men.
[time=3044] All they're going to do is take me down blind alleys.
[time=3047] The friend I'm related to the source, I'm in Christ.
[time=3053] And in him is all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, resident with him and as a person.
[time=3060] God is at home in him.
[time=3062] But notice the second in him.
[time=3065] In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[time=3069] And ye are complete in him.
[time=3075] Now, if I'm complete, I'm not looking for anything more.
[time=3080] If I've got all there is to have, I'm not going to go searching out in some other direction to find something else.
[time=3085] I've got it.
[time=3090] The Bible says I am complete in him.
[time=3093] I am in him.
[time=3094] I am in completed in him.
[time=3096] Now, that means two things.
[time=3097] That means I don't need any subordinate power.
[time=3102] You say pastor, I know you have Christ and that's, but don't you think it's important that you are well versed in the philosophies of men and the comparative religions of the world?
[time=3113] You know, that's as absurd as if I were married to the President of the United States and don't laugh.
[time=3120] It'll be a woman one of these days.
[time=3123] And I needed something.
[time=3126] And I said, I'm going up and check with the Secretary of State and see if he can't get me an appointment with the Vice President and then hopefully I can get what I need.
[time=3135] Man, if I'm married to the President, I go right to the top.
[time=3140] And I'm married to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3143] I am related to him.
[time=3144] I don't need anything subordinate.
[time=3145] There's no long system I need to go through to get to him.
[time=3148] I can get on my knees and in one minute I can be in his presence.
[time=3153] I can ask him for wisdom and his wisdom is right here for me to understand.
[time=3157] In him.
[time=3158] I am complete.
[time=3161] I have all I need in Christ.
[time=3164] I not only don't need any subordinate power, I don't need any supplementary power.
[time=3168] Nothing else.
[time=3170] The Colossians were trying to extol the virtues of this reasoning and they were saying Christianity is alright, but you need Jewish legalism along with it and you need a little taste of philosophy along with it and it doesn't help to have,
[time=3182] helps to have a little Greek mysticism and you put all those things together and it's just a wonderful amalgamation.
[time=3190] And the Bible says no, you just get rid of all that other stuff and you dwell on the simplicity which is in Christ because in him you're complete.
[time=3202] If you go back through the passage we've studied, you'll notice in verse six we are told that we are to walk in him.
[time=3210] In verse seven we're told we're to grow up in him.
[time=3214] In verse eight we're told that we're to make him the test to make sure that which is after Christ.
[time=3223] In verses nine and ten we're told to draw upon his fullness.
[time=3226] He's the center of it all.
[time=3228] Walk in him, grow up in him, make him the test, draw upon his fullness, let him be all and in all to you.
[time=3235] 1500 years ago someone put together a poem that is a prayer.
[time=3240] And I think it is a good summary of what we're trying to teach with the book of Colossians which is Christ is all I need.
[time=3247] He's the center and source and circumference, the totality of my life.
[time=3252] This prayer you can tell was set in the setting 1500 years ago but listen to it, you've probably heard it may be set to music.
[time=3258] It goes like this, Christ be with me, Christ in the front, Christ behind, Christ within me, Christ below me, Christ above me, Christ at my right hand, Christ at my left, Christ in the fort, Christ in the chariot, Christ at the helm, Christ in the heart of every man who thinks of me, Christ in the mouth of every man who speaks of me.
[time=3287] Christ in every eye that sees me and Christ in every ear that hears me, Christ is all in all.
[time=3298] Friend, I think we ought to be the greatest intellects the world has to offer when it comes to pursuing the understanding of our world through the vision of the Word of God.
[time=3311] That's what Christian education is. But Paul says beware, don't get sidetracked off in some humanistic, wild-eyed, radical scheme of things and lose the simplicity that is in Christ.
[time=3325] The simplest old wash woman that knows John 3 16 is wiser in the eyes of God than a man with 10 PhDs who's never been on his knees to accept Christ as his Savior.
[time=3340] Let us pray.
[time=3345] Father, we thank you for the simplicity which is in Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=3351] And as we bow before you in these closing moments with the power of this passage upon our hearts, we would ask that those who listen to this service who have never heard the name of Christ never named that name in faith believing will trust in him right now this very moment.
[time=3372] Those listening by television, those here in this auditorium, we'll simply bow to acknowledge him as their Savior and accept him as their Lord.
[time=3381] We ask our Father that this will be a moment of decision in the lives of men and women, young people, boys and girls, a time of commitment to Christ as all in all.
[time=3393] Our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed, so we close this service. If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you may trust him, you may do it right now.
[time=3403] Simply invite him to come into your life, accept him, acknowledge him, say I believe that you are my Savior, and I accept you as the salvation for my sin.
[time=3413] Come into my heart and forgive me and make me your own and he'll do that. He'll do it right now for anyone who will ask here in this auditorium or wherever you may be.
