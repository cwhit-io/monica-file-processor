[time=0] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=8] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=12] I hear a voice of joy, by heart of the river to say,
[time=24] I sing my soul, I say God to thee,
[time=31] I pray the Lord, I pray the Lord,
[time=38] I sing my soul, I say God to thee,
[time=45] I pray the Lord, I pray the Lord,
[time=60] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=66] We welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=69] This is the second morning service that we've enjoyed together here.
[time=73] We're grateful especially now for the opportunity that this hour affords us to welcome all of our friends who join us by way of television to this hour of worship and praise.
[time=84] Our prayer is that God will use it to encourage and strengthen your heart, to bring you into a closer relationship with the Lord, and if you do not know Christ as your Savior, to
[time=95] bring you into a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=99] We believe that the present day is the day of grace and the grace is the difference between
[time=105] what we were before we came to Christ and what we are now.
[time=110] Those of us who are Christians marvel at the grace of God that He could take us from what we were and bring us to a place of holiness and righteousness before Him.
[time=119] Our choir sings about that grace, "What Grace Is This?"
[time=138] [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=296] And all God's people said, "Hey men, hey men, we're so happy to have with us today for
[time=308] the ministry of this Lord's day, Diane Sussek.
[time=312] She and her husband are in the ministry of evangelism.
[time=315] They live in York, Pennsylvania, and she is with us throughout the day to minister to us in song.
[time=322] I've already heard her in the early service, so I know that you're headed for a real blessing
[time=328] as she shares with us the ministry of God's Word through music.
[time=332] Open your hearts to her now as she sings for us.
[time=335] [MUSIC]
[time=357] This is my father's birth and to my listening ears, all nature sings and round me rings
[time=376] the music of the spheres, this is my mother's birth, I rest in the heart of rocks and the
[time=397] trees of skies and seas, his hands the wonders brought.
[time=409] [MUSIC]
[time=434] Praise for the singing, praise for the morning, praise for them springing, fresh from the
[time=459] world, sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven, like the first two fall, the first
[time=484] brass, face for the sweetness of the wet garden, sprung in complete ash, where his feet
[time=509] rise, mine is the sunlight, mine is the burning, born of the one light hidden so plain.
[time=539] Praise for the morning, praise for the morning, let's recreate the shine of our new day.
[time=568] We really are excited that you share the Bible hour with us, if you're visiting with us
[time=587] for the first time this week through television, we want to express to you our personal gratitude for sharing this hour of Bible study and music, and we hope that the result of our time together
[time=598] will be that you'll be encouraged in your faith and that if you do not know Christ in a personal way you'll be drawn to Him and come to know Him even today.
[time=607] During this special time in our telecast we have an opportunity to sit down with you right there in your living room and talk with you about the things that are going to encourage you beyond the scope of today's telecast.
[time=619] And Donna we've been sharing with our friends at home a very special book that we feel very excited about because it's so very practical and deals with things that people are asking about today perhaps more than ever before.
[time=632] In our society today we live at such a fast pace that it creates problems and questions for all of us and my father-in-law has written a handy little book that answers your questions
[time=644] and the ministry that he's had throughout our country and the churches that he's been he's discovered that there are recurring questions that people are asking and he has taken these
[time=654] questions and answered them from the Word of God and put it concisely in a little booklet which we would like for you to have and in order to have that booklet it's really easy for you to get it all you need to do is call our toll free number 1-800-4539000.
[time=671] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would like the booklet that we've offered on today's broadcast and we will get it in the mail to you right away.
[time=679] Donna this book is so very practical because it doesn't ask questions people aren't asking but it asks the very important questions that well you always wanted to ask your pastor or some Christian friend and the answers are not only there in easy to understand language
[time=694] but are supported with the words from the scripture that will help you to know that this is not just a man's answer but it's the answer from God.
[time=702] So we're excited about having this booklet and making it available to all of our many Bible our friends and once again you can have that booklet through the toll free number 1-800-453-9000 of course if you want to write to us that's alright too because that gives
[time=717] you an opportunity to say something about the telecast and perhaps let us know a little bit more about you when you write you need to write to me pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana now before we go back to our service today we want to remind
[time=734] you again that there's a very excellent way that you can be involved in a regular and systematic study of the word of God right there in your own home.
[time=742] This past week as I was traveling on a preaching assignment I had the opportunity to talk with
[time=748] a lady who shared with me that she had a real need in her heart and in her life for more serious Bible study I happened to have in my briefcase an extra copy of the daily walk
[time=759] and it was a real exciting thing for me to be able to share that with her and give her the March edition so that she could get started right now in studying the Bible.
[time=768] Donna the daily walk is a plan that works because it shows you how to do what you really
[time=774] know you ought to do but sometimes don't get around to.
[time=777] And I think it's exciting to realize that you can read through the entire scriptures in one year and they outline it for you on a day by day basis.
[time=786] Each month you get an encouragement in the mail by way of a regular monthly study guide that helps you to know what to do each day there's a list for you to check off the assignments you've completed and a commentary on each passage and most important a practical application
[time=801] for you so that the Bible isn't just information but it's application to your life.
[time=806] The daily walk is another way that we extend our ministry into your home and we'd like to send you your first month's issue of the daily walk absolutely free if you'll just get in touch with us.
[time=817] Now once again let me give you the handle on communication it's one eight hundred four five three nine thousand that's a toll free number that you can call from any place in the United States absolutely free and when you call ask for the Bible our operator and tell her you would like to have your free copy of the daily walk and also request the free book that we're sending this month questions that people are asking by Dr. James T. Jeremiah.
[time=842] Now Donna before we go back to the service let's give them another opportunity to know how to get in touch with us by mail.
[time=848] Okay if you would like to contact us to us by mail just write to pastor David Jeremiah
[time=854] post office box one five two five oh Fort Wayne Indiana forty six eight one five and if writing
[time=863] is too time consuming for you in your busy schedule we would encourage you to call us at our toll free number one eight hundred four five three nine thousand.
[time=873] Donna we've made it so easy for people to get in touch with us that a person almost would have to say I really don't want to talk to them not to do it and I hope that those of you who have always wanted to let us know that you're there and a part of our television family will take advantage of this new and exciting way of communication pick up your phone and call our operator and let her know that you're there and request the information
[time=897] and literature that we have made available to you today.
[time=900] Now it's time for us to get back to our service we'll have some more music in just a few moments from our special guest musician and then I'm going to open the word of God again to the book of Colossians and today I have a very special message that I believe will be of help to everyone on the subject of how you can really be free as a person free indeed
[time=919] and I hope you'll stay with us until we get to the word of God.
[time=931] Thank you Dennis doesn't Dennis look nice and his beard oh my looks so handsome.
[time=940] I'm sure as some of you came to church today you drove in the state street entrance and
[time=946] you notice that some work has been done on our sign I just want to make everyone understand it clearly that I didn't do it well we did have an accident out in front of the church on Saturday night at three o'clock in the morning apparently a car became airborne coming down the street and hit that sign going about 80 miles an hour and we haven't done anything to it what you see is what happened so we'll have a new sign one of these days and reminded me of how thankful we all ought to be for God's provision and care for us many of us have traveled many miles over this past week and God has watched out for us and he's brought our guests to us through some very harried experiences with lost luggage at the airport and late flights and getting in and the wee hours of the morning but his grace brought
[time=991] her to us to sing for us and share for us and we've already been blessed and I know that those of you who live here in the Fort Wayne area want to be here tonight for our evening service because she'll be sharing more extensively in music this evening right now we're going to turn this part of the service back to Diane for her ministry.
[time=1026] The Lord is the strength of my life, the Lord is the strength of my life, the Lord is
[time=1046] the strength of my life, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope and the host
[time=1066] of the Lord is the strength of my life, the hope of my life, the hope of my life shall
[time=1094] I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be
[time=1143] hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of
[time=1164] shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the
[time=1175] hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my
[time=1193] I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life shall I be afraid, the hope of my life [MUSIC - 317 seconds]
[time=1519] Thank you, Diane. We're going to sing a chorus that we've sung many times here in these last weeks, especially in keeping with the theme of Colossians, and I think it'd be good for us to stand together.
[time=1528] Christ is all I need. Christ is all I need.
[time=1533] All, all I need. Everyone singing on the first word.
[time=1537] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=1575] And those of you who know the verse goes something like this.
[time=1579] Jesus crucified for me. He died on Calvary, and that is why I know.
[time=1587] He loves me so. He's all I need. Let's sing the verse together.
[time=1592] He was true to see God, for he died on Calvary.
[time=1609] Christ is all I need. Christ is all I need.
[time=1632] Christ is all I need. All, all I need.
[time=1645] Christ is all I need. Christ is all I need.
[time=1658] All I need.
[time=1664] And let's remain standing for prayer, Father. Thank you, that in your Son, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1671] We find our needs met. It doesn't make any difference what they are or how they surface.
[time=1680] Somehow, when we come to the Word of God and to the Son of God, we find that those needs have an answer.
[time=1688] Many times it's in the realignment of our own life with thy truth.
[time=1694] Confession of sin. The dealing with relationships that are out of focus with other people.
[time=1702] Lord, we know that the central part of our being cries out for an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1710] And when that relationship is right, everything else falls into place.
[time=1717] So we pray that you will help us as we open the word that declares him, that we might be faithful,
[time=1724] that he might be lifted up for he has said if he is lifted up, he will draw all men unto himself.
[time=1731] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen. You may be seated.
[time=1741] And our Bibles are open today to the book of Colossians in the second chapter.
[time=1746] And we're reading together, beginning at the thirteenth verse, this next section in Paul's writing to the church at Colossae.
[time=1756] Colossians chapter 2 verse 13.
[time=1760] And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, have he made alive, together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.
[time=1770] Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us and took it out of the way,
[time=1778] nailing it to his cross, and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
[time=1788] Let no man therefore judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or of the new moon or of a Sabbath day.
[time=1797] Which things are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
[time=1804] Most of you know I am certain that a large portion of the New Testament was written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison.
[time=1815] Those letters which he wrote while confined are called the prison epistles.
[time=1822] One cannot help but notice as he reads the letters written by Paul while he was bound in prison,
[time=1829] that there is a sense of freedom that comes from his writings which astounds the common reader.
[time=1836] Though bound and confined he seemed to be so free.
[time=1841] He rejoiced in his bondage because the Word of God was set free in the lives of other people.
[time=1847] There is nothing of complaining or bitterness. No one gets the impression from reading his letters that he is sorry about his situation.
[time=1855] He seems to have come to the place in his own life where no matter what his circumstance he was a free man.
[time=1863] I suppose the reason that that is so amazing to us is because it is so different from that which we notice in modern Christendom.
[time=1871] I do not know anyone today who has been in prison for their faith personally.
[time=1877] And yet I know a great number of free people, people who have never known the stench of a Roman dungeon
[time=1884] or the feeling of Roman chains or men and women who have never experienced confinement even like we have it today,
[time=1893] men and women like that who are free personally and physically who are bound spiritually and emotionally.
[time=1900] Men and women who are chained to their guilt, who are bound to their oppression by Satan and his demons,
[time=1910] who are so under the bondage of the criticism and peer pressure of other people that they cannot make a movement without feeling bound in and chained in.
[time=1923] Someone has written that all of our memories, both good and bad, are on the other side of the cross and the open tomb.
[time=1936] Though this passage which we have read today seems at first blush to be a very technical passage with a lot of words that may be difficult to understand,
[time=1945] it holds the key for modern Christians to know what it means to be free and to be free indeed.
[time=1953] For in these few verses the Apostle deals with those three things that seem to chain most Christians,
[time=1960] the problem of past guilt, the problem of overwhelming oppression with the attacks of Satan in their life,
[time=1968] and the problem of being criticized or judged or set up or as someone has said even sandbagged by other Christians in their own Christian walk.
[time=1978] I personally believe that this passage, though it may be difficult to understand when you first read it,
[time=1984] is one of the most important passages that Paul ever wrote.
[time=1988] For it sets the Christian free.
[time=1991] And I covet your attention today as we study its truth. I ask you to open your heart to receive what God would say to you by His Spirit,
[time=2000] and that you listen not only with your ears but with your being and with your heart, so that you, like Paul, might be set free no matter what your circumstance might be.
[time=2011] I want you to notice that all of these great truths find their meaning in the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2018] In the thirteenth verse Paul talks about the fact that we have been made alive together with Him.
[time=2024] We have been set free by the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2029] And the first thing that that means to every Christian is this, that God has dealt with our guilt.
[time=2036] In the thirteenth verse he tells us that our sin has been forgiven.
[time=2041] The word forgiveness is the word carismenos, which means that God has given us a grace gift of forgiveness.
[time=2048] He has given to us a package wrapped up in the blood of Jesus Christ, and in that package is forgiveness for our sins.
[time=2057] I don't know if that gets through to your heart as it does to mine, but having studied what this passage says,
[time=2063] I am overwhelmed with the fact that I am forgiven.
[time=2067] I am a forgiven person. God has forgiven me.
[time=2072] I have talked with people in the counseling room who have been under the burden of guilt, and I have said in essence, God says you are forgiven, but somehow the message doesn't seem to get through.
[time=2082] They hear it, they give mental assent to it, they nod their head that they understand what is said, but somehow the message doesn't reach down to the seat of guilt in their life and set them free.
[time=2093] I suppose that's the reason why Paul, when he was communicating the truth of freedom and forgiveness, used three very powerful illustrations to make that truth come home to the hearts of the Colossian believers.
[time=2106] For you see, there were those in Colossae who were trying to use guilt as a weapon to cause the Colossian Christians to do things that were not central to the Christian faith.
[time=2116] They were reminding them of past obligations and past responsibilities and all of the things that were a part of the Jewish tradition,
[time=2123] and Paul is writing to them to let them know that the problem of their guilt has been resolved.
[time=2129] I want you to notice what he says about God's dealing with guilt in the believer's life.
[time=2135] First of all, notice in verse 14 that he says that guilt has been blotted out like the handwriting of ordinances.
[time=2143] Now there are two very important words in that phrase that you must understand.
[time=2148] The word handwriting is the word chirigraph.
[time=2152] It's a word that was used in the Roman times to describe what happened when a person was indicted for a crime.
[time=2160] They would bring his charges together and they would put them down on a piece of papyrus.
[time=2166] They would list them out. It was his chirigraph, the handwriting of ordinances, and they would write it out.
[time=2172] And many times if the prisoner was pleading guilty to the charges, he would sign at the bottom of that list.
[time=2178] He is guilty. He has done all of the things that are listed out on that piece of papyrus.
[time=2184] Now the Bible says that God understands us to be guilty because there is a handwriting of ordinances which is against us and which is contrary to us.
[time=2195] That handwriting of ordinances is the law which was written in the finger of God on the tables of stone.
[time=2202] It is nothing more or less than the commandments of God given to Moses on the mountain in the Old Testament.
[time=2209] What that means is that that law, that list of commandments is God's indictment of the person who stands judged by the list.
[time=2218] That law says thou shalt not, thou shalt not, thou shalt not, and every person who is honest in his own life knows that in thought or indeed in action or in omission he has broken the law of God.
[time=2232] And that handwriting of ordinances is his indictment. It is the law that says you are guilty.
[time=2239] Paul said if it had not been for the law he would not have known sin.
[time=2242] Paul said that the law was God's school master to bring us to Christ. What did he mean by that?
[time=2248] He meant that when a man looks at the law of God written in the tables of stone and sees there the manifestation of God's holy standards and looks at his own life and sees how far short he falls of that standard he recognizes that he is guilty.
[time=2264] And so every one of us here have a reason to feel guilty if we don't go any further in this passage. God says we have broken his law and we stand charged and guilty before him.
[time=2275] But I want you to notice what Paul said. Paul said that through the cross of Jesus Christ he has blotted out the handwriting that was against us.
[time=2286] Now in the times of the writing of this passage they would often write on the papyrus and they used a kind of ink that did not have acid in it so it would not etch itself into the fabric.
[time=2297] And oftentimes when they were finished with the use of that particular piece of parchment and they wanted to use it again they would take a certain substance on a sponge like object and they would wipe it clean so they could write on it again.
[time=2311] And Paul said God by the cross of Jesus Christ took the charges that were against us in his holy law and he dipped his sponge in the grace of the blood of his son the Lord Jesus and he wiped it clean so that there are no charges against us any longer.
[time=2328] When Jesus died upon the cross he blotted out the charges that say I am guilty. And so when the Bible says I am forgiven what that means is there are no charges against me.
[time=2340] I don't owe God any debt there is no I you waiting I owe you waiting to be paid by David Jeremiah the indictment the charges against me have been erased.
[time=2352] I am forgiven.
[time=2355] Paul says not only have those charges been canceled but they have been carried away. He took it away he said and the literal description of that phrase means as someone has written that he took the charges against us and he wrench them out of our clutched
[time=2371] So when I read that statement it reminded me of some folks that I've talked to who have hung onto their guilt is if it was their last possession and they didn't want to let it go. And the Bible says that when Jesus died on the cross he reached down into the clenched fist of everyone who would believe in his name and he took the guilt out of their hand and he pulled it out of their fist and said you can't have your guilt anymore.
[time=2393] I'm taking it away and the Bible says he put it as far as the east is from the west he put it behind his back he buried it in the deepest of seas never to remember it again.
[time=2404] So if you have been to the cross for the forgiveness of sins your slate has been wiped clean and your guilt has been taken away.
[time=2412] But not only does the scripture say that he canceled it and he carried it away but the scripture goes on to say that he crucified our guilt he nailed it to the cross.
[time=2424] Now there are a number of ways that we could explain that phrase. Some historians have told us that when a man owed a debt and he paid that debt oftentimes the debt would be taken to his door and a nail driven through it to signify that the debt had been paid.
[time=2442] But I rather believe that Paul is more anxious for us to understand our guilt in its relationship to the cross than in relationship to a Roman custom.
[time=2451] And so I can't help but think that he was referring first of all to the fact that when a person was crucified under the Roman law the charges for which he was indicted were hung upon the cross so that all would know that this man is being charged with this sin and therefore is being crucified.
[time=2469] In Matthew chapter 27 and verse 37 were told that when Jesus Christ hung upon the cross that they set up over his head the accusation written thus this is Jesus the king of the Jews.
[time=2482] That was the accusation the indictment for which Jesus was crucified he claimed to be the king of the Jews and the Romans hung him for that reason and they put his accusation over the top.
[time=2494] And Paul is saying that every Christian who has been to the cross for the cleansing of his sin.
[time=2499] It is as if God has taken all of the charges against him all of the accusations for which he has been found guilty and he has nailed them up to the cross where Jesus died and he has let Jesus Christ be the substitutionary atonement for his sin.
[time=2515] That is the second way we might understand that term he nailed it to the cross but I believe there's even a better way for us to understand it.
[time=2524] For the New Testament tells us that when Jesus Christ died he bore our sins in his body on the tree.
[time=2534] That means that the sins that you committed and will commit and commit in the future all of your sins Jesus bore in his body.
[time=2543] I don't understand all of the details of it I can't comprehend it in my finite mind and yet the Scripture says he became sin for us.
[time=2552] My sin in your sin was placed on the body of the Son of God the Lord Jesus and when he died on the cross he died bearing the sin that you and I have committed.
[time=2562] Now the Scripture says that he was nailed to the cross and so when the Roman soldier took the hammer and drove the nail into his flesh he literally nailed your sin and my sin to the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2576] And he put that sin there that it might be dealt with and when Jesus died the sin was dealt with.
[time=2584] And Jesus Christ by his shed blood tells us in the Word of God that we have been forgiven.
[time=2593] Now the problem with most Christians I know is that we have better memories than God does.
[time=2599] And when God says we are forgiven we like to keep the sin ourselves and we don't accept it.
[time=2607] I have talked to people in the counseling room about guilt and how they can be free from guilt and they say they're Christians and they've asked for God's forgiveness and has God forgiven you yes but I just can't forgive myself.
[time=2620] Oh you have a higher standard than does the Almighty Holy God your standard for forgiveness is so much higher than God's standard that when he forgives you you cannot forgive yourself.
[time=2634] Oh it is sheer audacity and it is the sin of pride that allows a Christian who reads in the Word of God that he has been forgiven that his sin has been cancelled and carried away and crucified
[time=2649] and he hangs on to it with the fingers of his own self pride because he will not accept what God has said about him that he has been forgiven.
[time=2657] And I want to tell you something I've done some things in my life for which I'm not proud.
[time=2662] But when I finally came to understand the truth that I've been forgiven that God took the sponge of his grace and wiped the slate clean.
[time=2672] There is a freedom that comes from that. A freedom that knows that I'll never have to stand judgment for that sin because God has dealt with it and he dealt with it decisively on the cross and the penalty has been paid and I can walk as a free man because sin has been handled in my life.
[time=2691] And I ask you today those of you who like to hang on to your guilt and fondle it and I know some Christians who don't want to let go of their guilt because it's a means of attention.
[time=2702] They like to hang on to their guilt it gets them all kinds of attention from the family.
[time=2706] Listen there's a kind of pride that's involved in not accepting what God says about your sin that you need to deal with today if he has forgiven it you need to accept his forgiveness.
[time=2719] He canceled it. It's done.
[time=2725] But that's not the only problem we have in our Christian experiences and that's not the only reason why a lot of Christians I know are not free.
[time=2733] Someone has said that Satan is going to be nipping at the heels of the best Christian when he drags his tired feet through the pearly gates.
[time=2740] I believe there's some truth to that. I don't know about you but he doesn't ever seem to give me any rest.
[time=2745] He knows every problem I have and every weakness in my life.
[time=2749] I'm not supposed to be ignorant of the devices of Satan and I can guarantee you he's not ignorant of the strategy he needs to use on me.
[time=2756] And there have been times in my life when I felt like there was no victory available to David Jeremiah from the oppressive attacks of Satan in my life.
[time=2765] When I want to remind you from this passage of scripture that not only has God through the death of his son the Lord Jesus canceled the problem of guilt in the Christian's life but he has conquered the foe of Satan in the Christian's life.
[time=2777] The Bible says verse 15 having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly try upping over them in it.
[time=2788] Back in Colossians chapter 1 and verse 16 we're told that Jesus Christ created all things that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things created by him.
[time=2803] He created the principalities and he created the powers. Now notice in chapter 2 and verse 10 that that which he created he is in control of and you are complete in him who is the head of all principality and power.
[time=2817] And Ephesians 6, 12 tells us that there are some principalities and powers that are not good principalities and powers they are the principalities and powers under the domination of Satan for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and the rulers of darkness in high places.
[time=2838] Now the Bible says that when Jesus Christ went to the cross he rendered in operative in the life of the Christian the power of Satan over him.
[time=2849] Paul once again appeals to Roman custom. He says that he spoiled them and he made an open show of them.
[time=2858] And in using the language that he used he appealed to the understanding of his readers who would know what he was talking about for in the custom of the Romans when a general would win a battle oftentimes he would bring the slaves that he had conquered from the enemy
[time=2873] and he would strip them down naked and in order to make an open show and shame of the conquered enemy he would line them up in a procession and as he came back to his hometown as the conquering general he would bring behind him all of those that he had conquered from the enemy
[time=2890] and he would shame them in front of all of those who were now on the victor side some of them who had been under the oppression of the defeated ones and they would line up the streets and here would come the enemy who had been conquered and it would be a shameful thing
[time=2905] and they had been stripped and they would be put to an open shame and the Bible says that when Jesus Christ went to the cross men and women that he rendered in operative in the life of the Christian the power of Satan.
[time=2921] Turn in your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 2 Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil.
[time=2947] When Jesus died on the cross he sentenced Satan to final and ultimate doom.
[time=2954] And the Bible says he made an open show of him he stripped him of all of his power in the Christian's life and by his death and his conquering of death in resurrection Jesus Christ says to every Christian if you put your trust in me Satan no longer needs to be the domineering force in your life
[time=2974] for I've conquered him I have judged him and he's just waiting until the sentences to be carried out at the end of this age.
[time=2983] Can you imagine anyone in a Roman colony as they watch those stripped and powerless slaves being brought back by the conquering general perhaps having been under their domination before the war going up to a stripped and openly shamed slave now and saying
[time=2999] I was under your dominion before and I know that you've been conquered but somehow I still feel your dominion in my life.
[time=3007] A lot of Christians like that Satan has been dealt with he has been conquered he has been defeated and yet we act as if he is the most powerful thing in our lives and we do not know how to come to the word of God and claim the victory that is ours in Jesus Christ for he has conquered Satan
[time=3025] and he has put him out of our lives as a force that needs to control us if we will just submit ourselves to the principles of the word of God which are available to us because of the cross.
[time=3037] He has canceled our guilt and he has conquered our foe.
[time=3044] But you will notice at the end of this text that there is a therefore and the therefore tells us what this means in our own life let no man therefore judge you.
[time=3056] The third thing that the death of Jesus Christ has done to set me free is that the cross has corrected my vision.
[time=3064] I want you to notice at the end of verse 17 that Paul uses an illustration to tell us about the way it was before the cross and the way it is now.
[time=3072] He says before the cross there were certain things that were the shadow of that which was to come.
[time=3078] Now a shadow is cast by a reality but a shadow is not a reality.
[time=3084] A shadow is just that which is cast because of the reality's relationship to the sun.
[time=3092] And Paul is saying that the things that he mentions in the verse previous to that the dietary laws and the feast days and the moons and the sabbas all those things were a shadow.
[time=3102] A picture of what was to come and what were they picturing.
[time=3105] They were picturing the fact that there was coming one in whom all the feast days would be fulfilled about whom all the sabbas would center.
[time=3113] And in that person there was the reality and now Paul is saying you are on this side of the cross and the reality is come please don't live in the shadow.
[time=3123] How do Christians live in the shadow?
[time=3126] They let other Christians put them in bondage and other things beside Jesus Christ.
[time=3132] We don't do it this way we don't do it that way and many of those things are things which are legislated without a clear word from God in the scripture.
[time=3142] I know Christians who are more bound to the shadow than they are to the reality.
[time=3148] You ask them are you a Christian and immediately they say yes and here's how I'll tell you I'm a Christian I don't do this I don't do that I don't do this I don't do that.
[time=3155] They got their filthy five their nasty nine and their dirty dozen and they never violate any of them.
[time=3161] Now that is not to say that we are not to be holy but men and women it is to say that in the Christian's life the central thing is not the shadow it's the reality.
[time=3171] It's the reality of Jesus Christ and his person living and beating within the Christian experience.
[time=3178] There are 23 verses in Colossians 2 and 16 of them mention Jesus Christ.
[time=3187] And you see this is not a call to a lower standard of living.
[time=3190] Sometimes when we preach the grace of God and against legalism people say well that means I can do whatever I want.
[time=3196] I can go out and live like everybody else because I'm not a legalist.
[time=3200] Listen if you understand what this passage is saying you will understand that when you come to know Christ and have a personal relationship with him every day is a feast day.
[time=3208] And every day is a Sabbath day.
[time=3211] And there is no such thing as the moon waning when Jesus Christ is present and the sun never sets.
[time=3218] And there is no secular and sacred because he is all and in all and every day alike is related to the presence of Christ in your life.
[time=3226] And whether you eat or whether you drink you do it all to the glory of God the Father and for the person of the Lord Jesus.
[time=3235] What Paul is appealing to in this passage of scripture is what he has been saying over and over and over again in the book of Colossians Christ is all you need.
[time=3245] And don't let anyone lay on you regulations and stipulations and all kinds of heavy things that do not come from the revelation of Jesus Christ because the only thing that matters in the Christian life is whether or not you have the right relationship with the Son, the Lord Jesus.
[time=3262] Someone wrote of their struggles in trying to be holy by the law and they wrote it this way by various maxims, forms and rules that pass for wisdom in the schools.
[time=3274] I sought my passions to restrain, but all my efforts were in vain.
[time=3280] But since my Savior I have known, my rules are all reduced to one, to keep my Lord by faith in view, that strength supplies and motive to.
[time=3298] Paul is appealing to us in this passage of scripture to be free, to be free in our relationship with Christ, to be all that Christ wanted us to be, and not to go back into the shadow, but to stay in the reality.
[time=3314] I entered once a home of care and Peanutrian want were there.
[time=3322] I asked the aged mother whence her helpless widows defense.
[time=3329] She answered Christ is all.
[time=3334] I saw the martyr at the stake, the flames his courage could not shake, nor death his soul, Paul.
[time=3343] I asked him whence his strength was given. He looked triumphantly to heaven and answered Christ is all.
[time=3353] I stood beside the dying bed of a little child with aching head awaiting Jesus' call.
[time=3361] I saw him smile on his dying day, and as his spirit slipped away he whispered, "Christ is all."
[time=3371] I dreamed the hory ages fled. The earth and sea gave up its dead and fire dissolved this ball.
[time=3381] I heard the martyr Christians throng and heard the burden of their song to us this Christ is all.
[time=3391] Men and women when Christ becomes all, when he is the center of your life and you want to please him more than anything else in all the world, all of these other things fade into oblivion, and you are the prisoner, the bondservant of Jesus.
