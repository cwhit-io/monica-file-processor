[time=0] against that there is a book about Nell and about her ministry which is a very helpful
[time=6] book for those who have cancer. It's called Living with Cancer. And the book was written by Mary Beth Mossard and the forward is by Everett Koop M.D., who is becoming very famous
[time=19] in his ministry in the Christian world. You may know of someone who has cancer who needs a word of encouragement. This book is available I believe in almost all the Christian bookstores and I recommend it highly because it has the answer in the person of Jesus Christ. And
[time=35] if you know of someone who has that problem you can be a ministry to them by sharing this
[time=41] book with them. Now we're going to listen to the ministry of our own star Narwhal. She
[time=47] sings a song that lifts up the person of the Lord Jesus Christ entitled Precious Jesus.
[time=69] Precious Jesus. You are friend and home and joy and life to me.
[time=95] Precious Jesus. Precious Jesus. You are everything you're my all to me.
[time=121] You're the heaven where I rest. You're my strength through every test.
[time=133] You're the cleft of safety where my soul can hide. You're the truth for which I love.
[time=153] You're the reason for my song. Precious Jesus. You're my very breath of life.
[time=171] Precious Jesus. Precious Jesus. You are friend and home and joy and life to me.
[time=195] Precious Jesus. Precious Jesus. You're my life. You're my all to me.
[time=221] You're my life. You're my all to me.
[time=248] Thank you so very much for sharing the Bible hour with us today and for offering us this opportunity to sit and talk with you in your living room in this very special time in the telecast where my wife Don and I have a chance to chat with you at home. Today we want to
[time=262] talk to you about a very special book that we believe will be an extension of the Bible our ministry into your home. First of all the book has a great author doesn't it?
[time=271] Yes it does and I understand it has a good introduction too.
[time=274] The book was written by my father Dr. James T. Jeremiah and you guessed it I wrote the introduction but the book is entitled questions people are asking and it deals with some of
[time=285] the well the most penetrating questions that we we face in our lives today questions like
[time=291] is it ever right for Christians to be first in their own lives is self ever first we see all kinds of literature on the market today on how to be number one but does the Christian have a right to face that in his own life what about the problems of loneliness and discouragement well here in this very this very simple book questions people are asking
[time=312] Dr. James T. Jeremiah takes those questions and answers them from the word of God the
[time=318] book is filled with illustrations and stories but most of all with scripture I thought you'd be interested in hearing just one little portion of a chapter that well dad uses to illustrate
[time=330] the difficulty of life he quotes this in his book smog is unindurable the false fates aren't
[time=338] dissolvable the problems don't seem solvable the mess is unforgivable let's face it life's
[time=346] unlivable I'm sure there's some folks who feel that way about the problems they're experiencing
[time=352] but I want to encourage you and let you know that in this book you will find some answers to those problems now Donna we have a special way for our friends to get this book free and postage paid in their home this very week and we have instituted this to make it easier

[time=1236] Thank you David and Peggy Miller I want you to open your Bibles this morning to the book of Colossians and the second chapter Colossians chapter 2 and I want to read verses 1 through 7
[time=1259] Colossians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7 I hope you brought your Bibles because that's the textbook that we study and it's very helpful to be able to follow right along in your copy of the scriptures while we teach what the word of
[time=1274] God has to say Colossians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7 for I would that she knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at Laodicea and for as many as have not seen
[time=1287] my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[time=1306] and this I say lest any man should be guile you with enticing words for though I am absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk you in him
[time=1323] rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught a bounding with thanksgiving shall we pray together
[time=1336] our Father in heaven we thank thee for this word we thank you for the encouragement that it is to us we are grateful that in the sovereignty of God you have seen fit to open up the soul and heart of the Apostle Paul that we may look in upon him
[time=1352] that we may see the inward aspects of his Christian experience and Lord we would pray even as he has instructed us in his word that we would be followers of him as he is of Christ
[time=1367] we pray our father that this message will reach to each and every individual who hears my voice today and that even though we come to this message with a different set of circumstance each one of us
[time=1382] that the Word of God will find its place in each heart and that it will do its work in each life
[time=1391] that as it has in the past in accordance with God's promise it shall not return unto him void but it
[time=1397] will prosper in the thing where unto it has been sent we ask thy blessing upon this time together in the
[time=1404] scriptures we pray that you will meet the needs of individuals for we pray in Jesus name and for
[time=1410] sake amen someone has said we might well call this chapter the agony and the ecstasy of caring
[time=1421] I well remember that in my days as a student at Dallas Seminary one of my jobs while there was
[time=1429] to work as a chaplain in the Baylor University Hospital and while working in that university
[time=1435] hospital I had the assignment to meet people in the family room when there had been an untimely
[time=1441] death in the hospital I had no training very little understanding of what I was to do and
[time=1449] I found myself going through some tremendous struggles personally as almost every day there
[time=1456] was some tragedy with which to deal I would come home discouraged and filled with sorrow and
[time=1465] waited down by the agonies and problems of the people that I had met with one day the chaplain the head chaplain took me aside and he said David you need to learn the difference between sympathy and empathy you're getting too involved with these people and then
[time=1480] he proceeded to tell me how he was able to remain aloof at the same time ministering to their needs so I watched and what I saw was a man who was going about his duties doing that for which he was paid
[time=1493] but who apparently was not touching the lives of any people because he was going through the motions but he really didn't care I determined then and there that no matter how costly it would be
[time=1505] I would pray that God would preserve me from that kind of a cold and perfunctory attitude
[time=1511] toward the responsibilities of ministry how encouraged I am when I read about the apostle Paul
[time=1518] for he was a model for us all to follow he said as he wrote to these Colossians whom he had never
[time=1524] seen I have great conflict in my soul for you and when I looked that word up conflict I was
[time=1530] surprised to discover it is the word agona it is the word from which we get our word agony
[time=1536] Paul said I have great agony in my soul for you and then as we read on in the chapter we discovered
[time=1545] that the agony of Paul's soul had nothing to do with life and death the material things of life
[time=1551] the prosperity or poverty of the Colossian believers but it had everything to do with where
[time=1557] they were spiritually and Paul could write with a true pen as I think about you Colossians and you
[time=1566] who are in Laodicea and in Hierapolis the triple cities in the Lycus Valley as I think about you
[time=1572] as I know about you as Epiphras has come to share with me the details about you in your Christian
[time=1578] walk I can honestly say that my soul is an agony for you because I care someone has well
[time=1588] written that in religious matters arguments wrought in frost are powerless earnestness approaching
[time=1597] to passion is the all-conquering force we need a baptism of that kind of caring in the Christian
[time=1608] world today sometime ago I read a story about John Wesley one of the great Methodist fathers
[time=1615] on one of his visits to Ireland he met a young lady who was not in good health he spent about
[time=1623] five minutes with her barely enough to know who she was but what weighed on his mind is he walked
[time=1629] away from that encounter with the young lady was that he did not believe that she knew where she was headed for eternity and he knew that her health was not good so but the busy and elderly
[time=1642] Wesley sat down and wrote her a letter and we are encouraged to have a copy of that letter
[time=1650] for today this is what he wrote he said believe me my dear maid what are called pleasures and
[time=1657] diversions can give you no solid happiness they are poor empty insignificant trifles
[time=1664] you were made a little lower than the angels that you might live with them forever you are come forth from God and are returning to God as fast as a few fleeting years can carry you
[time=1678] but he wrote I am in pain for you I am concerned that you should forget like other pretty giddy
[time=1686] unthinking creatures oh young lady make haste be a Christian a real bible Christian now
[time=1694] and though that was not a conversation that took place face to base between two human
[time=1700] beings you cannot help as you read that letter since that John Wesley was not just taking charge
[time=1707] of his pastoral duties but he cared about that girl as I read what Paul wrote to these Colossians that he had not ever seen
[time=1718] I pick up the same fervor in his writing he cared what did he care about what really motivated him
[time=1729] to write such a personal and intimate letter to a group of Christians well I'm sure that if we
[time=1737] were to put down on paper the things that would so motivate us most of Paul's would never make our list he seemed to live in a world spiritually above the average and he was able to sort through
[time=1750] all of the incidental things of life and put his hands upon the real meaningful and make different
[time=1758] kind of priorities and so he does in this chapter first of all he writes as he begins
[time=1765] this particular part of his letter I have agony for you that your heart might be comforted in one of Walt Whitman's poems he writes this about agony he says
[time=1783] Agonies are one of my changes of garments I do not ask the wounded person how he feels I myself
[time=1790] become the wounded person that's what Paul was saying when he said I have agony for you that you
[time=1797] might be comforted in your own heart what does it mean to be comforted well the word comfort comes
[time=1804] from a word which is sometimes translated by the word comforter in reference to the Holy Spirit it is the paraclete the one who comes alongside to bring encouragement what Paul is saying is this
[time=1817] I am concerned I am agonizing I am praying for you Colossians that you might be confirmed in your
[time=1825] faith first of all as it relates to your love one for another that your hearts might be comforted
[time=1832] being knit together in love Paul prayed and his concern was that the Colossian believers might
[time=1839] stay close to one another in their love relationship while all of this heresy was raging around them
[time=1846] while the Gnostics were trying to make inroads into the life of the church Paul said you as believers make sure that your love is knit together that you are encouraged by that love
[time=1857] that you not lose sight of the importance of one another that as you walk along all of the
[time=1864] enemies being around you that you remember that it is your love relationship that is important he was to write later on in this epistle in the 14th verse of the third chapter above all things
[time=1875] put on love which is the bond of perfectness the word bond there is a word which could be
[time=1882] translated by the word cement Paul said that the cement of the church was the love between those
[time=1890] who participated in its ministry I visited this week one of our families who moved to the west
[time=1899] coast and I recommended a church to them one of the great churches in the country I believe with all of my heart and as we visited throughout the day this past week I said to her to this family
[time=1912] how are you getting along in your church life she said pastor we go to a great church I know
[time=1919] but she said there's something that's not the same and I said could you put it into words could
[time=1925] you describe to me what you're talking about she said it's it's that love that we feel between each other in the church at Black Hawk she said I go and I know I'm loved and she said there's a
[time=1936] kind of love that you feel in the air but she said it's not that deep kind of intimate being knit together kind of love that this passage is talking about Paul agonized in his soul that the
[time=1947] Colossian church would never lose sight of the encouragement which comes from being knit together
[time=1954] in love as a fellowship I have the deep and motivating desire in my own heart that God would use my
[time=1964] ministry especially in these days of darkness in our country as an opportunity to be an encouragement
[time=1971] to people when I go out to preach in Bible conferences or in and meetings in the evenings
[time=1977] during the week I always have within my heart a deep sense of one concern and that is to
[time=1983] encourage people do you know how many people there are world without end who are discouraged
[time=1990] how many Christians there are who are just looking for one positive word to encourage their hearts
[time=1997] when I finished this past week at the Christian Heritage College a time of ministry to the college
[time=2003] students I was getting ready to leave and a young lady walked up to me and she said pastor Jeremiah I know you don't have time to talk because you got to catch a plane but I have something I want to give you she handed me an envelope and I stuck it in my pocket and got in the car and went on to the airport about halfway across the country I remembered it and I pulled it out and it brought tears to my eyes because it caused me to remember and understand the goal of the
[time=2026] ministry the goal of encouragement this is what she wrote she said dear pastor thank you for being
[time=2033] our pastor this week I appreciate the messages from the word of God God used this time to help
[time=2041] me see that my mother's recent death was not meant for me to continue in loneliness and in sorrow
[time=2047] but to grow and get to know God in a way I've never known him before to put off my old man
[time=2054] and my past and to look to Jesus I've got a long way to go pastor Jeremiah this has been a hard time
[time=2060] for me but it's been a time for me to examine where I've been where I am and where I want to go
[time=2067] and this week I have been given a greater goal for the future and I thought to myself
[time=2074] Lord thank you thank you for the opportunity to be an encouragement and that's what Paul prayed
[time=2081] that the believers at Colossae would be knit together in love as an encouragement one to another
[time=2087] to be confirmed and comforted in their own love that is the greatest treasure that we have in our
[time=2093] church that is the thing we must not ever take for granted that we are here to help and encourage each other and we need each other's love if we're going to survive and as the world gets worse and
[time=2104] worse and the horizon gets darker and darker we will find ourselves fitting less and less and less
[time=2111] in the world system and we will be drawn to each other and how important that love is that we have
[time=2117] it needs to be cultivated it needs to be cared for and Paul said I care for you Colossians so much
[time=2124] that I agonize in my soul that that love might be cultivated he goes on in this passage of scripture
[time=2130] to write that he is not only concerned that their love for one another be built and knit together but
[time=2136] he desired that they be confirmed in the assurance of their faith he says that your hearts might be
[time=2144] comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of full assurance of understanding
[time=2151] I pondered as I read that particular prayer request as to why Paul would be concerned about that at
[time=2158] such a time as this and then it dawned on me that as he saw on the horizon the things that were
[time=2165] testing and trying and tempting the Colossian believers he realized that the one open door
[time=2172] through which Satan would always walk would be the door of doubt in the lives of the believers
[time=2178] Satan knows where there's a soft spot in our understanding and in our commitment men and women
[time=2185] if you do not have full assurance of your faith Satan knows that he is not ignorant of your weaknesses
[time=2191] and we must not be ignorant of his devices any Christian who is alive today who doesn't have an
[time=2197] absolute no-so salvation absolutely certain that you're going to heaven just as certain as if you
[time=2203] were already there if you don't have that kind of full assurance of faith Satan will find the
[time=2209] soft spot in your heart and through that door he will bring all kinds of problems for your spiritual life I have counseled with untold people who have allowed their own lack of assurance of salvation
[time=2222] to be a destructive force in their Christian life and Paul as he looked at those Colossians
[time=2228] realizing that the Judaism was present to tempt them and that philosophy was pervading their society
[time=2234] and that Greek mysticism was trying to make inroads into their lives Paul said I agonize for you
[time=2240] Colossians that you might be sure fully sure of your salvation and I ask you today as you think
[time=2249] about your own relationship to Jesus Christ can you say I know whom I have believed
[time=2255] can you say with absolute certainty that if I were to die this moment and stand before God
[time=2262] I know I'm ready to meet him I have the full assurance of my faith you say pastor nobody can know that that's the lie of the world the world says you don't know till you get there the bible
[time=2273] says you know the moment you accept Christ because he gives eternal life as a free gift and every single person who ever puts their trust in Christ at that moment can have full assurance of their faith I know that I'm going to heaven not because I'm good because I'm not I'm going to heaven
[time=2289] because one day by faith I receive Jesus Christ into my life and I accepted him and when I accepted
[time=2295] Christ I got the son and he that hath the son hath life and I stand before God tonight today as a
[time=2303] whole person in the sight of Jesus Christ and I have the full assurance of my faith men and women I agonize for you that you might have the full assurance of faith because if you don't that will be a door through which Satan will drag many problems into your life thirdly Paul prayed not only that they might be knit together in love that they might have full assurance of faith but he prayed that they might be confirmed in the knowledge of the mystery
[time=2328] now let me say that this is not a mystery mystery mystery is not some deep dark secret the word
[time=2337] mystery in the Bible is a truth which has been true from time immemorial which at a certain
[time=2343] point in God's program is unveiled for instance the mystery of the Jew and the Gentile in the church
[time=2351] together that mystery was not known to the Jews from time past they did not know anything about the church the Gentiles didn't know anything about it it was in God's mind but at a certain time in God's program he revealed the mystery of the church which brought the Jew and the Gentile believing together into one body that was the mystery here in our text he talks about another
[time=2372] mystery it is this one it is the one referred to back in chapter one verse 27 to whom God would
[time=2378] make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ
[time=2385] in you the hope of glory and Paul said I agonize for you Colossians that you might come to know
[time=2392] what is the mystery of Christ in you what is that mystery do you know the mystery of Christ in you a woman sits alone her son ran away to see 20 years ago
[time=2418] she is a poor widow lonely and in her loneliness there is a knock at the door and there stands
[time=2424] a bronzed stranger I understand you have a spare room he says she says yes I have a room to rent
[time=2434] may I rent it she said yes he comes in disguised so that she cannot see him it has been so long
[time=2444] she is not apt to recognize him but he is there she just doesn't know it one day they sit together
[time=2451] at dinner and there is a gesture and she says John and he smiles and says mother
[time=2461] that is the glory of the mystery of the son in the house he was there for a long time
[time=2473] she just didn't recognize all that was going on in her house and then one day the one who had been
[time=2479] living in her very home became fully revealed to her and she saw him for who he was and she recognized
[time=2488] that the glory of the mystery of her son was in her home and immediately when she recognized
[time=2494] that her whole life changed the relationship with her son was different there was a glory about her house that had been missing for 20 years all of a sudden she saw the glory of the mystery of her
[time=2505] son in the house there are some of you who have invited Christ into your hearts years ago
[time=2512] you brought him into your life by faith you put him in the back room kind of shut the door and said
[time=2520] you may stay there it's all right and 20 years or so have gone by and you've almost forgotten he's
[time=2527] there and then one day through the reading of the scripture or the hearing of the preached word or some song you hear all of a sudden by something that is said there is instant recognition it is the
[time=2539] son who lives within me it is Jesus who is alive within my being and though he has been present
[time=2546] for many years you come alive to the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory and there's a
[time=2552] difference about you there's a difference about the way you act and about the way you talk and about the attitudes that you have about life what is the difference he has been there all along but you did not see him for who he was and when Christ comes alive in your heart and you come
[time=2570] alive to who he is what a difference it makes and Paul said oh Colossians I pray and I agonize for you
[time=2580] that you would not just be Christians with Christ tucked away but that you might come to know fully
[time=2588] the mystery of Christ living in you and he passed her who agonizes and his concern for the spiritual
[time=2597] well-being of his people could well put that at the top of his list all of the concerns about
[time=2604] conduct and character and attitudes and activities and all of that all of that washes away into insignificance if once a person comes to understand that his body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
[time=2615] and that the Son of God who is God of God's resides within his being when once a Christian
[time=2622] fully comprehends the mystery of Christ in him all of those other questions which are of a secondary
[time=2628] nature just fade into oblivion no wonder Paul agonized that the Colossians might come to understand
[time=2637] Christ in them the end of this passage of scripture Paul agonizes in his own heart
[time=2647] for the growth and stability of these believers if we could move to verses five through seven
[time=2657] let me share with you very quickly that Paul's desire for these Colossians was that they might be progressing toward maturity it is not possible for us to understand these three verses unless we
[time=2668] realize that Paul is using a literary device to explain this truth and that literary device is the
[time=2675] use of what we call a metaphor there are four of them here it is a literary device whereby that
[time=2684] which pertains to another category of life is applied to something where it does not normally
[time=2691] belong here in this text Paul is going to use the metaphor of agriculture of the military
[time=2699] of construction and of humanity let's notice how he does it first of all he uses the metaphor
[time=2707] of agriculture he says Colossian believers I pray that you will verse seven be rooted in him
[time=2716] what was his prayer his prayer was that the Colossians just like a tree that sinks its roots
[time=2723] down deep into the earth would sink the roots of their spiritual lives down deep into the person
[time=2729] of Jesus Christ and in the very core of their Christian salvation experience they would be rooted deeply in their relationship with Christ as a tree sinks its roots down deep into the earth so they
[time=2741] would sink their roots down deep into Christ secondly he uses the metaphor of construction
[time=2748] he says that you might not only be rooted in him but built in him and here is the picture of a
[time=2754] house or a structure which is being built upon a foundation Paul said I'm anxious that the
[time=2760] foundation be strong and that the superstructure be built up upon the house now there are two things
[time=2766] that are very interesting about trees and houses both of them grow upon the same foundation trees
[time=2774] do not grow by sinking their roots down in the ground here and then jumping over here to grow a little bit the roots provide the base for the future growth you do not build a house by building
[time=2787] the foundation here and then putting the superstructure over here the house goes on the foundation and
[time=2793] Paul is very interested to explain to the Colossians that what they have trusted in in the person of Jesus Christ in in their personal salvation that their whole Christian life is to be built upon
[time=2804] that structure they are not to go over here and build it on Judaism not to go over here and build
