[time=0] (bell dings) ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=24] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=34] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=58] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=60] - We welcome all of you who have joined us here in the auditorium.
[time=66] This is our second service.
[time=68] The last service of the Sunday morning schedule here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=73] And of course, this is the opportunity God has given to us to share the ministry of the Word of God and the worship of the Lord with our many friends who join us at home by television.
[time=85] And so we're grateful for all of you who have come to be with us now for this next hour.
[time=89] We're praying that God will use it to encourage your hearts.
[time=92] A few moments, I'm going to open the Word of God and we're going to talk about how to improve our prayer lives.
[time=97] I can be sure of one thing that that's a message that will be helpful to all of us because all of us can use some help and encouragement in praying.
[time=106] So if you have your Bibles, you'll want to have them ready to open them to Colossians a little bit later.
[time=110] And then we'll be studying God's Word together.
[time=113] Right now, let's listen to the ministry of our choir and to the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=118] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=249] - Thank you, choir, for reminding us of a great truth, and that is reason to sing, isn't it, that your sin has been taken away.
[time=255] We're going to continue our worship of the Lord by listening to the ministry of the Petersons.
[time=261] Al and Lenna Peterson, as they sing for us a song that is a musical rendition of a truth from the book of Revelation.
[time=269] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.
[time=272] (gentle music)
[time=380] [MUSIC - 83 seconds]
[time=493] - We're so grateful that you've joined us today, and it really is a privilege for us to share the Bible hour with you, and it's a privilege for me to share this time with my wife, Donna, because it gives us an opportunity to talk with many of you and to, well, sort of feel like we're sitting in your home visiting with you about the things that we feel are very important.
[time=512] Donna, I know you enjoy this too, don't you?
[time=514] - Yes, I certainly do, and it's really neat to run into people in the store and say, "Hey, I think I've seen you." And to have them share with us what the Bible hour means to them on a one-to-one basis.
[time=526] - And I'm grateful for the privilege we have of not only preaching and singing and sharing, but also of making materials available to our Bible hour friends that will help them.
[time=537] And as we know our own hearts and motives, one of the overriding purposes of this program is that it might be a blessing and an encouragement and a help to people.
[time=548] Donna, we're living in a day, as you well know, when so much of the literature and the reading material that is extended in our world is all about how you have to take care of your body through proper nourishment and health foods and all of this and people have become very health conscious.
[time=565] And yet we in the church and those of us who stand for the truth of the word of God understand there's a different kind of health that we need to be concerned about.
[time=573] - That's right, that's our spiritual health, and so often it's easy to let day after day go by without feeding our spiritual bodies.
[time=583] And then that is evident in the way we live.
[time=586] - That's why we believe that we ought to be doing everything we can to provide spiritual nourishment for our own souls and for our own growth in the Christian walk.
[time=596] One of the ways we have tried to help you in that area is through providing a special daily Bible nourishment program, which is called the Daily Walk.
[time=606] The Daily Walk is a specified portion of scripture assigned to you each day, and there is an ultimate yearly goal in view.
[time=615] - And you can pick it up and start at any month, which is what I like, 'cause I have a tendency if I get behind, then I think oh, I'm just gonna forget it.
[time=624] But this, if you get behind, you can think, the beginning of the next month, I'm gonna start out and really stick with it.
[time=630] So if you messed up January, you can start in February and not worry about it.
[time=634] - Don, it sounds like a confession, but I know lots of folks identify with that.
[time=638] And I think that's the ultimate goal is to read through the scripture and to make it from Genesis to Revelation in a year's period of time or almost a year's period of time.
[time=647] And these monthly study guides are available to our friends in the Bible, our family, and we'd like to tell you how you can get them because they provide the information and the guidance that you need.
[time=660] For instance, Adana, in this particular issue, which is the February issue, the people would be reading the book of Numbers.
[time=666] And on the 14th page of this book, there is a chart which divides the book of Numbers down into separate categories.
[time=673] And that just helps to make the reading more meaningful and helps the people who are reading to get more out of their time in the Word of God.
[time=679] If there's one consistent thing that I hear from people who are in a Bible study program is that they don't get out of it, what they hoped they would get.
[time=688] I really believe, and I think we have the feedback from our own congregation that if you get into the Word of God in the daily walk program, you'll find the Bible will start to come alive.
[time=697] And the daily walk is our way of expressing to you the importance of being in the Word of God each day.
[time=703] We'll send you the first issue free if you'll write to us.
[time=707] - And to get your free copy of the daily walk, all you need to do is write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and just share with us that you would like your free copy of the daily walk.
[time=724] - And along with the daily walk, we continue to send out each week hundreds of copies of this very unique little book called the answer book.
[time=732] Now you can't buy this in any store.
[time=734] It is not something that's available in the Christian market.
[time=736] It is only available through the Bible Hour Telecast.
[time=739] We put it together for you.
[time=741] It is a book filled with scripture versus arranged topically so that you can find the verses that you need to have for the specific situation in your life.
[time=750] Donna, there's some very interesting subjects in this book.
[time=753] - Yes, it covers a vast range of them from, if you're having questions about your faith, if you need assurance of your salvation, if you're going through a time of sorrow and you need encouragement, just on almost any topic that you can think of.
[time=767] - And most women I know have purses big enough that they can stick this right in the purse and if they're out in the car, out on an appointment or visiting with some friends, they can open their purse and pull out this little book and it's filled with scripture.
[time=782] Easy to find and it's not just the reference but it's the text of the scripture written out in full.
[time=788] And then even at the end of this passage, of this little book is a list of other scriptures that aren't written out that you can look up if you need more information.
[time=797] Now the answer book is a tremendous tool and we've had businessmen come and say, I want 25 of these that I can use to give to my employees or I'm putting these out in my office so that I can make them available to friends.
[time=811] People are using these to distribute the word of God to great advantage and I'm just grateful that we could have a part in making them available.
[time=818] We'd like to send you your free copy of the answer book if you'll write to us this week.
[time=823] There is no charge for your first free copy and we'd like to send it to you free and postage paid if you'll just let us know.
[time=830] Once again, the address is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=837] During these last months, we have made many friends that we have come to call sponsors and I know Donna that you want to share a full sponsor with us today who is helping us get out the word in Chicago.
[time=849] - Our sponsor today in Chicago is Mrs. M.W. Pooley and Mrs. Pooley, we say a special thank you today for your part in getting the gospel out in the Chicago area.
[time=860] - I just like to add this word that she's been a very special friend of ours in this particular way and we're thankful for what she's doing and making the Bible our telecast available to all of the many hundreds of people in the Chicago area.
[time=873] Thank you again for all you're doing to make the Bible our reality and once again, let me encourage you if you haven't written to us recently, we need to hear from you during these early days in 1980.
[time=884] We're counting on you for your prayer and your support and we look forward to hearing from many of you this week.
[time=890] When you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=897] Now in just a moment, we're going to be opening the Word of God to the New Testament book of Colossians and talking about how we can improve our prayer life.
[time=905] All of us need some help there and God has some answers for us so I hope you'll stay with us until we open the scriptures in just a few moments.
[time=912] (gentle music)
[time=929] (gentle music) - Him number 666 tells us, "My Jesus, I love thee."
[time=951] You probably won't even need it.
[time=953] Let's sing one stanza of this great hymn of dedication.
[time=958] Shall we stand as we sing?
[time=988] (gentle music) Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1015] We've just participated in a ministry of worshiping the Lord with our finances and we're going to listen to the Word of God in just a few minutes.
[time=1024] This song fits in perfectly with both.
[time=1027] It tells us that God uses just ordinary people.
[time=1032] (gentle music)
[time=1045] [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=1264] - That's got a powerful message to it, that song.
[time=1269] And it reminds us that there are no unimportant people in God's program and in the ministry of the gospel.
[time=1276] And God has something for all of us to do.
[time=1278] And if we just recognize our responsibility in that realm, he can cause his work to go forward.
[time=1285] Little is much if God is in it.
[time=1287] Just before the message, the Black Hawk singers are going to share with us a song that reminds us that all that we need and all of the needs we have in our lives are to be found and met in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1301] Listen carefully to the words of this song as they share with us.
[time=1304] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 237 seconds]
[time=1569] - Thank you, Blackhawk singers.
[time=1570] The thing that makes music so meaningful to all of us is not only the beautiful harmony and the people who communicate it, but the truth of the message as we identify with it during the actual appreciation of the song.
[time=1586] I found myself thinking in my own heart as they were singing, that's true.
[time=1590] I find needs met and other things, but I find all of my needs centrally met in the person of Jesus Christ, and that's an encouragement to know.
[time=1599] Open your Bibles to the book of Colossians and the first chapter.
[time=1605] We shall read together, verses 12 through 14.
[time=1608] Colossians chapter one, verses 12 through 14.
[time=1612] We continue our studies in this great book, which exalts the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1618] We are concluding the opening prayer section, which began in verse nine and concludes with verse 14.
[time=1626] So I'm reading from my Bible, the first chapter of Colossians, verses 12 through 14, and I hope you'll follow in your Bible as I read from mine.
[time=1634] Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[time=1655] Let us pray together.
[time=1656] Father, take this message, we pray.
[time=1659] Cause it to find its way into our hearts and into our lives.
[time=1665] We have so much to learn about praise and gratitude and thanksgiving.
[time=1669] We come with open hearts to receive the truth by way of the ministry of the Holy Spirit through the word of God.
[time=1677] Lord, I pray that the attitude of everyone who is seated under the word of God today will be one of expectancy and desire and anticipation and readiness and willingness to hear.
[time=1689] And we'll give you the praise in Jesus' name and for us sake, amen.
[time=1694] I am certain that every pastor, every preacher,
[time=1700] has someone to whom they look in idolizing almost, in the Christian sense of the word,
[time=1709] that person by way of his ministry and all that he has accomplished.
[time=1713] Those of you who know me personally, know me well, know that one of the great people in my life and someone to whom I look with great admiration is a man who pastors the great first Baptist church of Dallas, Texas, an old gentleman by the name of A.W.
[time=1729] Chryswell, who has been there over 30 years.
[time=1733] I bring his name up because I wanna share something that I read about him recently but also to remind you to pray for him.
[time=1739] For I learned this week that Dr. Chryswell had a heart attack two weeks ago and I know that he would appreciate the prayers of this fellowship and all of our friends who watch.
[time=1748] He pastors a great church in America and one of the truly great ministers and preachers of the word of God.
[time=1755] Dr. Chryswell says that one time in the early days of his ministry while he was pastoring a church in Chickashaw, Oklahoma, he was visiting some of the folks who were a part of his congregation and he came upon a home of a lady who had a reputation of not being a very kind and grateful and gracious person.
[time=1773] She hadn't been to church in many, many years and when he knocked on the door, she opened the door with this cordial invite, "What do you want?" He said, "Well, I'm the pastor from the church "and I'd like to come and visit with you." She said, "I'm not interested in all that stuff.
[time=1786] "I don't believe in that religious business." She said, "God ain't never done nothing for me "and I don't wanna talk to you." He said, "Well, it'd be all right with you.
[time=1793] "I'd just like to come in for a few moments "and share with you." She said he walked in the door and he had never seen in all of his life a woman who seemed so discurdious and ungrateful and whose very countenance had been blighted by her spirit of ingratitude.
[time=1809] And for the next few moments he said, "I listened as she unfolded the story "of all of the terrible things that had happened to her "since she'd lived in that town, to her family, "to her house, to her finances, to her husband." And then he said, "As if out of context, "she asked me if I would like to hear some poetry "that she had written." Dr. Chriswell said, after listening to all of those negative things, I thought certainly poetry would be a step in the right direction, so I agreed.
[time=1834] Only to discover that her poetry had the same characteristic as her disposition.
[time=1840] He said the poem was so meaningful to him that when he went out into the car before he forgot it, he sat down and wrote out every word and this was the poem she wrote, "I hate Oklahoma, "not the land of my native birth, "but a land by all the gods that be a scourge "on the face of the earth, I hate Oklahoma.
[time=1859] "I hate Oklahoma where the centipede crawls "in your bed at night, and the rattlesnake "lifts its fang to bite, where the lizard "and the scorpion play on the sly "and the lonesome vultures sail high in the sky, "where water and food are an eternal lack "and a man's best friend sticks a dagger in his back, "I hate Oklahoma." Now that is a wonderful piece of creative work on the part of a very disillusioned and ungrateful woman, but there's a sequel to this story.
[time=1889] Later on in his ministry there in the early days of his life, he was called by the local funeral parlor and asked if he would have the funeral for this ungrateful woman.
[time=1902] And he said in telling the story that it's the only time in all of his life that he can remember that he preached a funeral where the only person present was the one who had died.
[time=1912] For her ungrateful and bitter spirit had shriveled her up inside until no one wanted to be around her, and she had not a friend in all of the world.
[time=1925] I couldn't help think of that story in light of the instruction of our text today where Paul reminds us of the wonderful opportunity we as Christians have and the tremendous responsibility that we have to develop within us the grace of gratitude.
[time=1943] In fact, as I went back through the letters that Paul wrote to the churches, I discovered that one of the consistent themes in his writing was the theme of Thanksgiving.
[time=1953] We do not have to go very far to hear one of the most famous verses of Thanksgiving from this great apostle as he wrote to the church in Thessalonica.
[time=1962] He said in 1 Thessalonians 5, 18, "In everything give thanks for this is the will of God "in Christ Jesus concerning you." But right here in the book of Colossians, the theme appears over and over again.
[time=1975] Paul begins in chapter one, verse three, by saying, "We give thanks to God and the Father "of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you." Here in the 12th verse, he reminds the Colossian Christians that he is praying that they will learn how to give thanks unto the Father.
[time=1991] Turn over in your Bibles to chapter two of Colossians in verse seven, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding with Thanksgiving.
[time=2002] Chapter three and verse 15.
[time=2004] And let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful.
[time=2012] Chapter three and verse 17, and whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
[time=2021] And notice chapter four and verse two, continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving.
[time=2029] Over and over again, Paul says it's important to have a grateful heart when he wrote to the Ephesians over in the fifth chapter of that letter.
[time=2038] He reminded the Ephesian believers that they were not to allow their mouths to be filled with filthy talking or jesting which was not meaningful kinds of communication, but rather with the giving of thanks.
[time=2050] Ephesians chapter five and verse four.
[time=2053] In Ephesians chapter five and verse 20, as he wrote to that church, he said giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2063] I can't help but wonder if sometimes in heaven as God looks down upon his ungrateful people, he does not sing the Psalms of the Old Testament David who in the 107th Psalm verses 21 and 22 cried out, oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness.
[time=2080] And for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifice of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing.
[time=2089] Oh that men would praise the Lord and have grateful hearts.
[time=2095] What a tremendous thing it is when God's people are bound together by their gratitude of the blessings which they have in Christ Jesus.
[time=2104] Now last week as we unfolded the beginning part of this prayer, we learned that there were certain things God wanted to do for us if we would fill our hearts and our lives with his word.
[time=2114] We learned that as we allowed God's word to filter down into our lives, that he would make many things happen to us by way of our Christian experience, that we would know we were pleasing God constantly, walking worthy unto all pleasing, that we would be producing fruit constantly, multiplying ourselves and the lives of others, that we would be progressing in the knowledge of God continually being built up and growing in God's truth, that we would be persevering in stress cheerfully.
[time=2146] I read this week by the way, a statement by H.G. Mool who said that joy is of a certain quality that needs to be developed.
[time=2155] He said if joy is not rooted in the soil of suffering, it will always be shallow.
[time=2162] And I agree with him and that's what Paul is saying, that joy comes out of stress and in the midst of it we learn what joy really is all about.
[time=2170] But the last thing that Paul said in Colossians chapter one, that would happen to us if God's word filled our hearts and if we were committed to the word of God and let it filter down into our lives is that we would be giving thanks unto the Father, verse 12.
[time=2185] I want to encourage you today from the word of God to examine the wonderful reasons that Paul has given us in these three verses for having thankful hearts as Christians.
[time=2198] Now most of the time when we have thanks giving services we thank God for all of the material things.
[time=2204] We have a house that protects us from the elements and we have food to put in our mouths and we have clothes upon our back and we have been spared from illness and sickness and thank you Lord for all of those things and that's good.
[time=2217] But you will notice that none of those things fall into the instruction of Paul concerning the thankful heart of the Christian.
[time=2224] Basically he has encouraged us to be thankful for three things in this brief prayer and I want you to understand them from the text today.
[time=2233] First of all, Paul reminds us that we ought to be giving thanks unto the Father because we have been rescued from darkness and made inheritors of light.
[time=2243] This particular theme finds its way into two of Paul's speeches recorded in the book of Acts.
[time=2249] We haven't time to look at them today but if you want to write them down you will find them in his address to the Ephesian elders he was about to leave them and in his address before King Agrippa found in Acts 20 and Acts 26.
[time=2263] The theme of Paul's speech had to do with the fact that we have been made inheritors, co-heirs with the Jewish people in the things of God.
[time=2275] Now the Bible says here in Colossians chapter 1 that God the Father hath made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
[time=2285] The word made us fit is a word which means to be qualified.
[time=2289] It means that God in heaven qualified you and me so that we could participate in the things which God has done for his chosen people, the Jews.
[time=2300] The Bible teaches that God set a program aside for the Jewish people and when they refuse to receive his plan we who are Gentiles were grafted in as it were according to Romans 11 and we receive the benefit that comes to us because of our inheritance in the Jewish people.
[time=2318] Now I've told you often that the book of Ephesians is the commentary on the book of Colossians and so let's take just a moment and read the commentary.
[time=2326] If you have your Bibles turned back to Ephesians 2 where this truth is wonderfully explained by the apostle.
[time=2333] In Ephesians chapter 2 verse 11 we read these words.
[time=2337] Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh you were called on circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands.
[time=2348] That ye in past times were without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world.
[time=2359] But now in Christ Jesus ye who were once a far off are made near by the blood of Christ.
[time=2367] For he is our peace who hath made both the Gentiles and the Jews one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity.
[time=2377] Now notice chapter three verse six.
[time=2380] That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[time=2388] Now go back to Colossians chapter one and notice what Paul is saying.
[time=2392] He is saying that as Christians we ought to have thankful hearts because God has qualified us to participate in the blessings promised to Israel.
[time=2403] And what are those blessings?
[time=2405] Well I know, you know that I just returned a few days ago from Florida where I participated in a Bible conference.
[time=2412] And one of the joys while there was to have some fellowship with the dear friend who has been here to minister in this church by the name of Steve Bolt.
[time=2419] One night after the service he invited us to his home and we had some fellowship over coffee.
[time=2424] On that very day he had received his new album just released.
[time=2429] And one of the songs on that album is a song that he sang when he was here and we listened to it together that night.
[time=2436] Before he played the album for us in his home he told us again of the ministry God had given to him as he's ministering to Jewish people there in that area.
[time=2445] And he wrote a song to the Jewish community.
[time=2448] It's a beautiful song and it expresses exactly what we're talking about here.
[time=2452] These are the words of that song.
[time=2454] They go like this.
[time=2456] First I would like to apologize for godless acts of men, done in the name of religion.
[time=2463] I pray they won't happen again.
[time=2466] Next I would like to just thank you my precious Jewish friend.
[time=2469] We have so much in common that my gratitude never will end.
[time=2474] We love the same prophets who gave us God's word, who through great Jewish leaders many people have heard.
[time=2483] We love the same cities, we love the same land and Israel forever will stand.
[time=2490] We really love you, your special people.
[time=2494] Messiah's people, God's chosen people.
[time=2498] We really love you, your special people, Messiah's people.
[time=2502] I wonder today if you understand men and women of the church, Christians in this generation that we have a great heritage that comes to us from God's chosen people.
[time=2515] We got our Bibles from them.
[time=2517] We got our Savior from them.
[time=2520] We got our understanding of the truth from them.
[time=2523] Oh, what a heritage we have.
[time=2525] And here God says through Paul the Apostle that the Christians of today have been made qualified to be a part of the inheritance of the saints in light.
[time=2537] Now that's the positive thing.
[time=2540] But in order to do that, in order to make us a part of the inheritance of the saints in light, the scripture says he had to deliver us from the power of darkness.
[time=2550] Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness?
[time=2554] Do you know what it means men and women to have been delivered rescued from the power of darkness and made inheritors in the kingdom of light?
[time=2564] Again in the book of Ephesians we are reminded of this darkness and its grip upon man.
[time=2570] It is a darkness which touches us inwardly, a darkness which surrounds us outwardly.
[time=2575] In the fourth chapter of Ephesians, for instance, in verses 17 and 18, Paul writing to the Ephesians said, "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that she henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened." The Bible teaches that before we came to Christ, we had darkness within our minds that enabled us not to comprehend the truth of God's light.
[time=2604] But Paul goes on in this same Epistle to remind us that not only is that darkness within us, but it is a darkness that surrounds us.
[time=2612] For in chapter six and verse 12 he says that there are rulers who are the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[time=2619] The darkness of the world is epitomized in the awful act of the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2627] In fact, there's a very interesting passage of scripture.
[time=2630] In the book of Luke, chapter 22 and verse 53, listen to it, when those men came to take Jesus and hang him on a tree, when they accosted him in the garden to take him away for his trial, Jesus said in Luke 22, 53, "Your hour is here and the power of darkness."
[time=2654] Do you understand what he was saying?
[time=2656] He is saying this very act is symbolical of all of the darkness of a world that does not know that the light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[time=2668] Now Paul is saying that as Christians we ought to be giving thanks to God who hath made us a part of the inheritance of the saints in light, having brought us out of the power of darkness and released us from its grip upon our lives.
[time=2689] We have been rescued from darkness and we have been put in to the light.
[time=2696] And that's a pretty good reason for us to bow the knee and say thank you.
[time=2700] Lord, I once was darkness, now I am light,
[time=2709] help me to walk as a child of the light.
[time=2713] But I want you to notice that there is another reason for our Thanksgiving in this text.
[time=2720] In Colossians chapter one and verse 13, we read that we have been delivered from the power of darkness, but we have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son.
[time=2731] If we should rejoice because we have been rescued from darkness and made light, the second reason for our gratitude and Thanksgiving is that we have been relocated from the kingdom of hatred into the kingdom of love.
[time=2748] Now let me explain what I mean.
[time=2750] You will notice in your text that there is a word used here for that process.
[time=2754] It is the word in the English language, the word translated, who has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son.
[time=2763] Let me tell you about that word.
[time=2765] It is used only two times in the New Testament and it is a very technical word that found its meaning in the ancient customs of the people of war.
[time=2776] It is the word methiste me.
[time=2778] It is a word in the ancient world which symbolized what happened when one empire conquered another empire.
[time=2785] If you know your history, you know that one of the customs was that often when one country conquered another, that the conquered country would be deported to a totally foreign situation.
[time=2798] We have two illustrations of it that come to mind from the Old Testament, the northern kingdom, having been carried away captivity by the Assyrians and the southern kingdom and the people of Jerusalem, having been taken away into Babylon and made captives in a country, not their own.
[time=2815] Now the word translated, the word methiste me in this text is a word which means to pick up a people, lock, stock and barrel and move them from one place and put them over in another place.
[time=2829] And that's what the Bible says God has done for us.
[time=2832] He has taken us at the moment of our salvation, picked us up lock, stock and barrel out of the kingdom of hatred and he has moved us over into the kingdom of his own dear son and made us citizens in the kingdom of love.
[time=2844] For you see, if you'll notice you're text carefully and if you have marginal renderings in your Bible, the text reads he has made us members of the kingdom of his dear son or the kingdom of the son of his love.
[time=2858] The word love is the word agape, the great word for love in the Bible.
[time=2863] What the text is teaching then is this, that when I accepted Christ, before that time I had belonged to the world of hatred.
[time=2871] But when I accepted Christ, he picked me up, lock, stock and barrel and he translated me over here and he put me down in the kingdom of love.
[time=2880] You know, I don't know any word that more describes that which is true when God's people understand what the word is all about and they operate according to the principles of the kingdom.
[time=2892] The principle is the principle of love.
[time=2895] Love between brothers and sisters, love that reaches out into all the world, love that has no geographical barriers or racial barriers.
[time=2902] But love that says you're part of the family and I love you and I sense your love to me.
[time=2907] By the way, did you know that the world in which you lived before you became a Christian was a world of hatred?
[time=2914] I'll never forget the testimony of a young man who was seated in this congregation this morning, who said that as he grew in the world and in its culture he came to the place where his life was epitomized by hatred to the point that when he looked in the mirror, he was almost disfigured by the hatred that was welling up within him.
[time=2934] Then one day he met the Lord Jesus.
[time=2936] The Lord Jesus picked him up, lock, stock and barrel, took him out of the kingdom of hatred and put him over in the kingdom of love.
[time=2944] And that's what the Bible says is to motivate our Thanksgiving.
[time=2949] Who has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son?
[time=2954] My, isn't it a wonderful thing to bow your knee before God?
[time=2958] And to say, Lord, thank you, that that old hatred that once characterized my life, anger and bitterness that you just took me out of that and you put me over here where God's people continually teach me how to love and how to be loved.
[time=2975] We ought to give thanks because we've been rescued from darkness and made inheritance in the light.
[time=2985] We ought to give thanks because we have been relocated from the kingdom of hatred into the kingdom of his dear son or the kingdom of love.
[time=2994] Thirdly, we ought to give thanks men and women because we have been redeemed from the slavery of guilt and given the liberty of forgiveness.
[time=3005] Notice what Paul says in the last verse in whom we have redemption, even the forgiveness of sin.
[time=3012] Do you know what it means to be redeemed?
[time=3016] Well, the word for redemption in the Bible is a word which comes out of the whole marketplace scene.
[time=3023] Oh, it is a word which in the times of the New Testament meant going to market to purchase something off of the market.
[time=3030] And in those days according to the custom, the great landholders would go to the marketplace in order to purchase slaves.
[time=3037] And Paul picks up that marketplace word, Agarazzo,
[time=3043] and he says, you and I were on the market as slaves.
[time=3047] We were in slavery to our guilt and to our sin and to our activity and to our actions.
[time=3053] And God came along and he took some blood from the cross and he used it as payment and he bought us back from the market and he freed us up from the shackles of guilt and sin and he gave us the liberty.
[time=3066] And what is that liberty?
[time=3067] The sense of being forgiven, the forgiveness of sin.
[time=3071] The concept is redemption.
[time=3075] The practical outworking of it is we are forgiven.
[time=3079] One of the most common things people say to me after they've come to Christ is, I feel like a load has been lifted off of me.
[time=3085] What is that?
[time=3087] You've been redeemed.
[time=3089] The shackles are gone.
[time=3090] The guilt is gone.
[time=3091] You don't have to stand guilty before God anymore.
[time=3094] You'll never answer for your sin.
[time=3095] God said he put it as far away as the east is from the west, behind his back, never to look upon it again.
[time=3102] He redeems you, sets you free from the slavery of your sin and gave you the blessedness of forgiveness.
[time=3109] Do you know what it means to be forgiven?
[time=3111] We know that on the human realm, don't we?
[time=3116] Have you ever done something to someone?
[time=3118] And then gotten under the load of guilt for what you've done, carried it, carried it, carried it.
[time=3126] Every time you thought of that person and just brought an oppression to your spirit, you knew it was wrong, you knew it was wrong.
[time=3133] And then one day you came and said, I'm sorry, here's what I've done.
[time=3138] Will you forgive me?
[time=3139] And with a look of love and acceptance on their face, they smile and say you're forgiven.
[time=3146] And what happens?
[time=3147] Right?
[time=3151] And that's what God says we ought to be thankful for.
[time=3155] One day we were chained in the slavery of sin.
[time=3160] We could not know the joy of forgiveness.
[time=3163] And he came through the death of his son, the Lord Jesus, and he bought us off of that market and he set us free.
[time=3171] And the liberty of forgiveness is ours each day.
[time=3174] You say, does that happen to me now in its fullest extent?
[time=3177] Let me show you a verse of scripture that has meant much to me just this week.
[time=3182] Reminds us of how God does this work.
[time=3185] Turn in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians chapter one.
[time=3188] Second Corinthians chapter one and verse 10.
[time=3192] In this passage of scripture where Paul is introducing his letter to the Corinthians.
[time=3201] He is talking about some personal physical problems he had in Asia.
[time=3206] And he thanks the people for praying.
[time=3209] And he says that God, verse 10, delivered us from so great a death and death deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver.
[time=3220] And I thought that's the way it is.
[time=3222] I have been delivered from the power of sin.
[time=3225] I am being delivered daily from the practice of sin as I submit myself to the Lord.
[time=3232] And thank God one day I will yet be totally delivered from the very presence of sin.
[time=3239] Isn't that the way it works?
[time=3240] I have been delivered from the power of it.
[time=3244] I am being delivered from the practice of it.
[time=3247] But thank God one day I'm gonna be delivered from the very presence of it.
[time=3252] I have been rescued from darkness.
[time=3259] And one day I will be totally rescued from the darkness of this world.
[time=3263] I have been made to understand what love is.
[time=3270] And someday I will know as I am known because of his love.
[time=3277] I have been redeemed.
[time=3280] I am being redeemed.
[time=3281] And someday I will be finally redeemed.
[time=3286] And men and women, that's a whole lot to be thankful for.
[time=3290] Someone has said that it would be good for every Christian if they could be unsaved for about one hour a week so they could remember how bad it really was.
[time=3300] We who have been in the kingdom and have known Christ for years forget what it is that God has done for us.
[time=3308] And Paul reminds us that if we're to pray correctly, we are to be giving thanks unto the Father for three things.
[time=3317] And if you don't remember any of the rest of it, remember these three things.
[time=3321] Three great qualities that we have in Christ.
[time=3324] We have light and we have love and we have liberty.
[time=3328] Shall we pray?
[time=3331] Lord, as we conclude this service,
[time=3338] there may be some who do not have those qualities because they do not have the source of them all, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3345] So we pray that even as we conclude with those who are watching at home, you will take the message of thy word and drive it home to hearts.
[time=3353] If there are those listening to my voice who have never trusted Christ as their Savior, who don't know what it means to be forgiven, who don't understand what it means to have the love of God in their hearts, who can't comprehend the difference between the darkness of this world and the light of Christ, may this be a day when they turn themselves completely over to Christ and allow the Holy Spirit to bring about the new birth in their life.
[time=3378] While our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed, those of you who are watching at home, if you've never trusted Christ, I trust you'll do it, that you'll do it today.
[time=3388] Allow Christ to come into your life, pray and ask Him to save you and forgive your sin.
[time=3393] Let Him know that you're sorry for your sin and that you want to walk with Him and have forgiveness.
[time=3399] When you do it, if you'll write and let us know, we'd be happy to help you by sending some literature to encourage you in your walk.
[time=3404] Those of you here in the auditorium, can you say with assurance, I know what it means to have the light of the glorious gospel shine in my heart.
[time=3415] Pastor, I know what it means to sense the love of God coursing throughout my being.
[time=3422] Preacher, I know what it means to be at liberty for my sin, to be forgiven.
