[time=11] >> From the Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=20] [MUSIC]
[time=34] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=36] We welcome you to the service which is the second morning service
[time=43] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the service which comes into your home by way of television.
[time=48] We're grateful for you who have joined us now and this is the weekend of July the 4th here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=55] Some of you receive this program a little bit later than that.
[time=59] We have a great celebration here in honor of our country.
[time=63] Tonight we'll have four or 5,000 people here for our patriotic panorama and be given in three different concerts.
[time=70] And so our choir is all decked out in the fineries that they will be wearing tonight.
[time=76] And they are going to sing for us now one of the songs that is a part of the patriotic panorama.

[time=508] We're so grateful that you've joined us today for the Bible Hour Television Program, and especially for this particular time when we can talk with you personally at home.
[time=516] We come into your home during this particular part of our program.
[time=520] It gives us an opportunity to talk with you personally just as if we were seated there in the living room with you.
[time=526] As we share, as we spend these moments together, are the things which can help you beyond the direct ministry of the Bible Hour Television Program itself.
[time=535] Joining me today is always at this particular part of our television program as my wife Donna.
[time=541] Donna, we've been just sharing with the folks over these past months the importance of their being in the Word of God every day using a special program we call the Daily Walk.
[time=551] The Daily Walk is a Bible tool designed to help you read through the entire scriptures in one year.
[time=559] For instance, if you were to start in the month of July, you would start with the Book of Proverbs, and you would read through the entire Book of Proverbs and Isaiah during the month of July.
[time=569] Donna, yesterday I saw the mail come back from the month of June, people sending back their reports of the reading that they have done, and I was just overwhelmed to see how many folks are staying with the program all the way through the year reading every month the assignments so that they can read through the Bible each year.
[time=589] During this month, if you were to be reading with us on the 21st of July, you would be studying the Book of Isaiah, and on that particular page you would share together an overview of the entire section that you're reading, and then some personal applications of that section along with the delineation of all of the major topics that are in those chapters.
[time=610] When you finished reading the assignment for July 21st, you would have a grasp of that whole section of scripture, and you would be able to walk away from your Bible study knowing that you have come to grips with some very important doctrine that would help you grow in your life, give you a better understanding of the Word of God.
[time=627] We're excited about the Daily Walk because we believe it will make a difference in your life.
[time=631] We'd like to show you how you can get involved in reading the Bible every day in a meaningful way that will make a difference.
[time=638] For your free copy of the Daily Walk, all you have to do is pick up your telephone and call our toll-free number.
[time=644] The number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=649] Just ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like your free copy of the Daily Walk, and we'll be happy to send it to you.
[time=656] That number again is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=661] Or if you choose, you may write to us, and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46-815.
[time=673] Donna, we're also very excited about the Bible study tools that we've provided over the months to our friends at home.
[time=680] Simple tools that a layman can use without question.
[time=683] And the one that we're offering right now is a special little booklet that I've put together that condenses many of the key scriptures in the Bible into a very small pocket-sized edition called the Answer Book.
[time=696] Now, the answer book is nothing more than just a collection of scriptures topically arranged, completely written out on the page so that you carry this with you wherever you go, you have a source of key Bible verses that will help you in your life, verses on the subjects of grief, verses on the subjects of prosperity, of loneliness, anything that touches your life, we've found the major passages that touch that subject, and we've coordinated them in this little book called the Answer Book.
[time=727] Once again, this is yours just for the asking.
[time=731] When you call us at our toll-free number, 1-800-4539000, or write to us at post office box 15,000,
[time=739] Fort Wayne, Indiana, we believe that this study tool is a very helpful tool for your life, and even the women are liking it, Donna.
[time=748] Yes, it's really handy as a counseling tool if you have opportunity to share with people who are in need and you have the scriptures right there at your fingertips.
[time=757] And it fits in the pocket book, it's easy to carry around, you can have it with you wherever you go, and it's a great tool to use in your own Christian life.
[time=766] So we'd like to encourage you today to take advantage of these study tools, the Daily Walk and the Answer Book, and once again, you can take advantage of this opportunity by calling us at 1-800-4539000, or writing to us at post office box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=785] Before we go back to the service, let me just say a word about the message that I'm going to be giving in a few moments.
[time=790] Today, I'm going to speak on the subject, does God have a plan for America?
[time=795] I hope you'll stay with us, with your Bibles, your pencils in the notebook.
[time=800] To share with us the truth for today's hour, does God have a plan for America?
[time=828] I am unworthy of the price He paid for me.
[time=841] I am unworthy of His death on Calvary.
[time=850] I am unworthy to call upon His name,
[time=859] that He loved me, still He loves me,
[time=865] praises holy name.
[time=872] I am unworthy of the blood He freely gave.
[time=879] I am unworthy for His sin, I was a slave.
[time=889] I am unworthy to bear His precious name,
[time=899] that He loved me, still He loves me,
[time=905] praises holy name.
[time=913] I am unworthy of the place He has prepared.
[time=922] I am unworthy of His love, and He has shared.
[time=932] I am unworthy to call upon His name,
[time=941] that He loved me, still He loves me,
[time=949] praises holy name.
[time=965] And that was Marilyn Wong. Thank you, Marilyn, for ministering to us in song just before the message.
[time=972] Ron Hackett and Dennis Kirschner are male duet when they come and sing for us.
[time=977] This is a song of prayer for our country.
[time=981] It is a very appropriate introduction to the message I am going to bring in a moment, so listen not only to the melody, but to the message of the song.
[time=990] [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=1214] I could handle a little more, but not right now.
[time=1216] I think we'll wait till the night.
[time=1218] Open your Bibles to the Book of Jeremiah.
[time=1224] I hope you know where that book is.
[time=1227] Jeremiah in the Old Testament.
[time=1231] And I want you to have your Bibles open.
[time=1234] We're going to read just one verse now, but we're going to come back to this chapter in the message, and so keep your Bibles open to the second chapter of Jeremiah.
[time=1243] Right now I want us to read the 13th verse of Jeremiah chapter 2.
[time=1251] And I'd like for us to read it together out loud.
[time=1253] I know we have some difference in translations, but most of us will be close enough so we can
[time=1260] stay together.
[time=1262] Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 13.
[time=1264] Are you ready?
[time=1265] Let's read it out loud together.
[time=1267] For my people have committed two evils, they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters,
[time=1276] and hewed out sisters, broken sisters that can hold no water.
[time=1282] Let's pray together.
[time=1284] God in heaven as we have read this portion of thy word, we have been so much aware of the fact
[time=1290] that it is an apt description of our land.
[time=1294] We pray that as we unfold in these few moments, the blessing of God upon us, as we examine
[time=1303] the pattern of the Bible in learning how God deals with nations, that you will bring
[time=1309] to our hearts conviction.
[time=1311] Lord, I pray most of all that as we listen to this message, we shall not be caught listening to it collectively.
[time=1318] It's so easy for us to do that when we address national ills.
[time=1323] May we listen to it individually, for we are individually a part, either of the problem
[time=1331] or of the solution to it.
[time=1333] We ask thy blessing upon us as we discuss today this theme from the Word of God and from the
[time=1340] history of our land in Jesus' name and for his sake, Amen.
[time=1346] In this special summer series of messages, I am speaking today on the subject, does God have a plan for America?
[time=1355] During the close of the last century, a very strange system of Bible interpretation originated.
[time=1364] Today there are a number of followers of this particular interpretation, both here in the United States of America and in Great Britain.
[time=1373] The system is called Anglo-Israelism, or British-Israelism.
[time=1380] The basic error of this system is that it teaches that the ten tribes of the northern
[time=1387] kingdom of Israel carried away at the Assyrian conquest, settled in Assyria, later escaped
[time=1395] from that country, and wandered across the continent to Europe and settled in the British
[time=1403] Isles.
[time=1405] Thus the British people according to this philosophy are the true Israelites, and the inheritors
[time=1412] of all the promises of the Old Testament, the promises made Abraham into his seed, the
[time=1419] promises regarding the expansion of the land, all of the blessings that Israel had in the
[time=1425] Old Testament now according to this doctrine belong to Israel and to the United States,
[time=1434] and since we came basically from the British Isles at the beginning, we are included in
[time=1440] this very intricate system as a branch of Israel.
[time=1445] So you can take the Old Testament scriptures and you can preach the Old Testament scriptures to the church, so they say.
[time=1453] The British Israelites make a very special and arbitrary division between the Jews and
[time=1459] Israel.
[time=1460] You have to listen close because this is very confusing.
[time=1463] The Jews, according to their plan, are the descendants of Judah, and they were the only
[time=1470] tribe in Palestine during our Lord's ministry on earth.
[time=1475] They alone were responsible for the crucifixion of Christ and a curse has rested on them ever since, according to this philosophy.
[time=1484] Now the Israelites weren't responsible because they were on their trek toward Britain in the British Isles and ultimately to the United States.
[time=1492] If you listen to the radio very regularly, if you turn the channels much at all late
[time=1498] at night or very early in the morning, you probably hear sort of a modern exponent of British Israelism.
[time=1504] He has mixed it in with a few other heirs and some other false doctrine, and it's very confusing, but he applies all of the Old Testament scriptures to the New Testament church and you can't do that.
[time=1516] Louis Talbot, Bible scholar, studied British Israelism and he said, "I have come to the
[time=1522] conclusion that this whole system is a delusion of Satan.
[time=1527] It is a denial of the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ, a presentation of a false
[time=1533] Messiah leading people to rest on their national connection for their salvation instead of
[time=1541] upon the blood of the Lord Jesus." Many patriotic messages that I have heard have come very close to British Israelism.
[time=1556] Using Old Testament passages referring to God's plan for Israel, the patriotic preachers make unwarranted applications to the United States.
[time=1564] They take the promises made to Israel and they actually say those promises are to the church.
[time=1570] Whatever you do that, folks, you have unrightly divided the Word of God.
[time=1577] There's much we can learn from the Old Testament as we'll see in a moment, and there are many parallels between the way God dealt with nations in the Old Testament and the way he is always dealt with nations, but we do great disservice to the Word of God to take the Old Testament passages of Scripture no matter how keen our patriotic interest and apply them to today's church or today's America.
[time=1598] The fact of the matter is the United States is not mentioned in the Bible at all.
[time=1605] Some have tried to make a secondary analogy of the USA as a part of the European common
[time=1611] market in the book of Daniel.
[time=1614] They say that since most Americans come from one of the ten nations in the Ten Kingdom Federation
[time=1621] that obviously the prophecies that have to do with the ten nations of the European common market include the United States, and we're going to be a part of that.
[time=1630] That's a very distant application, and I would be hard-pressed to build any great doctrine of eschatology on such an analogy.
[time=1639] Still others have mentioned that America is not in the Bible, and this is a sobering thought,
[time=1646] because by the time the prophetic events of the Bible take place, America will have ceased
[time=1652] to be an important power in the world, or even more frightening she may have ceased to be altogether.
[time=1662] So I don't have a Bible message for you today from the Old Testament that says God in His
[time=1668] prophecy predicted this for our country.
[time=1673] But apart from prophecy, does God have a plan for America?
[time=1680] Peter Marshall and David Manuel ask that question in the introduction to a book which I've been
[time=1687] reading this summer.
[time=1688] It is a long book, and it takes a long time to get through it, and I haven't made it yet.
[time=1692] But the title of the book is The Light and the Glory.
[time=1696] And the book is an investigation of the possibility that God had a plan for our country.
[time=1703] In the introduction to the book, they asked this question, "What if Columbus' discovery of America had not been accidental at all?
[time=1711] What if it were merely the opening curtain of an extraordinary drama?
[time=1717] Did God have a special plan for America?
[time=1720] Like all those who have discovered the reality of living for Christ, they wrote, "We knew
[time=1727] that God had a plan for each individual's life, a plan which could, with spiritual effort,
[time=1734] be discovered and followed, what if he dealt with nations like he dealt with individuals?
[time=1742] What if, in particular, he had a plan for those he would bring to America, a plan which saw this continent as a stage for a new era in the drama of mankind's redemption?
[time=1755] Was our vast divergence from this blueprint after such a promising beginning?
[time=1763] The reason why God seemed to be allowing us to move into a new dark age?
[time=1774] Those who study history and the Bible cannot help but notice that there seems to be, as
[time=1786] one looks at it from the vantage point of the 20th century, a very definite indication that
[time=1793] God did have a plan for America.
[time=1797] Now the fact that we do not have any direct reference to it in the Old or New Testament does not discount the fact that in his sovereign purpose he could have included America as
[time=1806] a part of his overall redemptive plan, a glance at our history will prove that America is no accident, that the great God who in the dawn of creation flung the stars out into
[time=1817] space put the sun in the sky and spanned the satellites in space, established this country
[time=1824] for the glory of God in the advancement of the Christian faith.
[time=1828] In the book The Light and the Glory, I've been interested to read in the first few chapters of God's superintending hand upon the life of Christopher Columbus, who, stumbling through
[time=1839] a series of errors, landed in this land by accident, but not by accident, because God
[time=1845] had his hand upon the wheel and brought him here, even though he did not know exactly
[time=1852] what was going on.
[time=1855] We need to remind ourselves as a country that all of the benefits and blessings that we have are wrapped up in a book and in a person.
[time=1862] The book is the Bible and the person is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1866] These are the foundation stones of our republic, and this is the bridge over which we have come into this land.
[time=1875] Someone has written that in retrospect, as you look back on this land, discerning the plan from history's perspective, you see Washington kneeling in the snow of Valley Forge, you
[time=1887] see our founding fathers on their knees at the First Continental Congress, you see the gaunt Lincoln praying in the hour of crisis.
[time=1897] You see Woodrow Wilson reading his Bible by the White House lights.
[time=1900] You see Dwight Eisenhower concluding his inaugural address with a fervent prayer for
[time=1907] divine strength and guidance.
[time=1911] Looking at it, I say from this perspective, back through history, one cannot help but discern
[time=1917] that the hand of God has been upon this land, America has become the land of the free and
[time=1925] the home of the brave, not by blind fate or a happy set of coincidences, but because
[time=1933] a wise and benevolent God was hovering over this land from the very conception from its
[time=1940] very birth.
[time=1947] And we can say with assurance that America is a great land.
[time=1953] Not because we have made it great, what makes a great country?
[time=1961] One man has written this analogy to help us understand why we are great and why we might not be great.
[time=1968] He said if continental expanse made a nation great, Siberia would be the mightiest country.
[time=1975] If concentrated population made a nation great, India would be the greatest nation.
[time=1981] If ancient culture made a nation great, China would be the leader of all the families of the earth.
[time=1987] What makes a nation great?
[time=1990] It is the character of the people.
[time=1992] A nation is made great not by its fruitful acres, but by the men who till them.
[time=1998] Not by its great forests, but by the men who use them.
[time=2002] Not by its rich minds, but by the men who work them.
[time=2007] As Lyman Abbott said, America was a great land when Columbus discovered it, Americans have made it a great nation.
[time=2014] It is interesting to note at this perspective of history that although America has only 7% of the world's population, more than 50% of all the modern luxuries that are known in the world characterize civilization found right here in this country.
[time=2030] So we might stand and criticize it and be honest about its faults and decry the immorality
[time=2038] that fills our society.
[time=2041] We need to remember folks that while we are criticizing it, people are standing in line trying to get in.
[time=2051] Individuals who get in flimsy boats that have no possibility of ever getting to the other side and endanger their very existence for the mere hope that somehow they might be able to get through into America, our great country.
[time=2066] As one looks at America from this vantage point, he has to ask the question, "Why has
[time=2073] God allowed it to be great?" What is it that has caused this land to have a special blessing above all other lands?
[time=2081] In 204 years, we have progressed way beyond the ancient civilizations beyond any possible
[time=2087] comparison.
[time=2088] Why?
[time=2089] I don't have time in this hour to share with you all the reasons, but let me postulate
[time=2095] three or four that I think are crucial.
[time=2097] Why God has blessed this land?
[time=2100] First of all, I think America has been blessed because it has been the launching pad for the modern missionary movement.
[time=2107] And God has blessed us because of that.
[time=2110] In the United States, we have the distinction of providing three-fourths of all the missionaries
[time=2116] who are evangelizing the world, and almost the same amount of money and material aid.
[time=2122] The cause of world missions has been an integral part of the history of America.
[time=2128] You look out across this world of need and the world of lost men, and you put...
