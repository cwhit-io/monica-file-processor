[time=0] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=6] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Gerelin.
[time=11] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=25] And we welcome you to this service, which is coming to you from the auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=31] All of our many friends who have joined us now by way of television, we thank you for being with us.
[time=36] Today we are continuing the series of summer messages, which have to do with the issues
[time=42] that we face in election year 1980.
[time=45] And in a few moments, I'm going to be speaking on the very controversial theme, is homosexuality and alternate lifestyle.
[time=52] I doubt very seriously whether many of you will leave until we deal with that question, and I hope you will stay with us until we have had opportunity to discuss it in detail.
[time=62] In the meantime, we're going to share together in the worship of the Lord Jesus Christ as we exalt His name and lift Him up before others.
[time=69] And one of the ways we do that most effectively in this church is through the ministry of our choir.
[time=73] They sing what is now considered to be an invitation hymn, but a great hymn of invitation
[time=79] to all who listen, only trust Him.
[time=82] And they're under the direction, of course, of Mr. Don Kruger, our minister of music.
[time=112] He will be the rest, I trust Him in His Word.
[time=122] Holy trust Him, holy trust Him, holy trust Him now.
[time=134] He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now.
[time=152] Oh Jesus, let His precious God, which was built to be strong, but strong into the grace, and one that gorgeous, by this God.
[time=178] Yes, Jesus is not true, the wind can lead you into rest.
[time=189] We live Him with a deep wind, and you are fully blessed.
[time=201] Holy trust Him, holy trust Him now.
[time=213] He will save you, He will save you, He will save you now.
[time=226] He will save you, He will save you now.
[time=247] And we hope that you understand that an invitation can be given at the beginning of a service
[time=258] as well at the end, and we would say to all of you who may not know Christ as your personal Savior, you can trust Him right now, even before the message and accept Him as your personal Savior.
[time=269] We have had the joy in recent days of some great music in our church, and we were so blessed
[time=275] when God brought two young men to us, not too many months ago who became a very, very exceptional
[time=282] male duo, and just as we were getting used to them, one of the men was transferred out of our area.
[time=289] We've been able to get Him back today to share in the ministry of music for us throughout the day here at the Bicock Baptist Church.
[time=297] His name is Blake Leopold, and he teams with one of our men, Keith Brodigan, to provide some excellent music for us in today's service.
[time=309] In the morning when I rise, in the morning when I rise, give me Jesus, give me Jesus,
[time=335] give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus before the break of day, just
[time=350] before the break of day, just before the break of day, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give
[time=363] me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, oh, when I come to die, oh, when I come to die,
[time=386] give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus, give me Jesus,
[time=416] give me Jesus, give me Jesus.
[time=429] I'm so grateful that you joined us on the Bible Hour today, and I always enjoy this opportunity to sit and talk with you as you view the television program there in your own home.
[time=439] Normally my wife Donna joins me for this occasion, but today she's home taking care of two children who are ill and who want to go to camp very badly this week and so are doing their very best to get back on their feet before the deadline.
[time=452] This is a very special television program that is very exciting to all of us who are
[time=458] part of the Bible Hour Ministry because it's one of the very first programs that is being carried on the National Christian Network, a brand new satellite television network that covers the entire United States.
[time=469] The National Christian Network is one of the new satellite networks that is being used to carry the gospel to every creature, and it means because our program has been chosen to be seen on that television network that we are now available to everyone in the United States of America who has cable television carrying the National Christian Network satellite
[time=490] programming.
[time=491] It means that we are now not just confined to the Midwest, but this program is available all over the United States of America.
[time=498] We'd like to hear from many of you this week who are watching us for the first time on the National Christian Network as we evaluate our programming in this way.
[time=506] It will help us to know that we're meeting in need in your life.
[time=510] So if you're watching for the first time, sit down today and write us and let us know that the Bible Hour is reaching you.
[time=516] When you write, write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=523] Once again, that's Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=529] We'd like to hear from at least 500 new viewers during this month as we have expanded our television reach through the Dayton Springfield area and through the National Christian Network.
[time=539] During this time, we usually have the opportunity of sharing with you some Bible study helps that we believe are very, very good in making you grow in your faith and in the knowledge
[time=549] of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=551] The very best that I know, I believe that the daily walk, our daily Bible study is the finest
[time=557] Bible study tool available any place in the United States today.
[time=561] It is a program that takes you through the Bible in a year.
[time=564] It makes it possible for you to read a portion of Scripture each day, not only understanding it as you read it, but understanding the commentary that's written here in this book to make that passage meaningful in your life.
[time=576] At the end of each section is an application to help you understand how the passage applies to your life.
[time=583] Each monthly guide is filled with charts and helps and suggestions to make the Bible come alive in your experience.
[time=590] We'd like to have the opportunity of sending you this month's issue of the daily walk absolutely free.
[time=595] And you can receive your free copy of the July issue of the daily walk if you will simply pick up your phone and call us at this toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=607] Once again, the number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=611] It's an absolutely free call from any place in the United States.
[time=614] And when you call, ask for the Bible Hour operator, tell her that you'd like to have your free edition of the daily walk Bible study guide, and she will take your name and address and immediately will respond and send this book into your home.
[time=628] We also want to encourage you that along with the daily walk, there's some other Bible study
[time=634] helps that are available through the Bible Hour Television program.
[time=637] This week I got a letter from a pastor in South Carolina who was traveling through this area and heard our television program and saw us talk about what we call the answer book.
[time=647] He wrote and requested several copies to use in his counseling ministry.
[time=651] The answer book is a list of Bible scriptures of Bible texts that are topically arranged
[time=658] to help you meet the need in your life.
[time=660] On each page are a number of topics and underneath the topics, the printed out scripture texts
[time=666] that tell you all you need to know about that subject.
[time=669] In this book, alphabetically arranged are subjects that have to do with grief, have to do with loneliness, subjects that have to do with the need in your life, and then underneath
[time=680] those subjects, the scripture texts that help you understand what to do.
[time=684] Now the answer book is a book that I personally have put together and make available to you through the Bible Hour Television program.
[time=691] Once again, you can receive your answer book absolutely free if you will call us at 1-800-453-9000.
[time=699] Ask for the answer book and we'll send it to you this week.
[time=702] We need to hear from many of you during these summer months.
[time=705] The summer time is both an exciting time for ministry and a challenging time to all of us who are involved in the media programming, sending the gospel out to the homes of this nation.
[time=715] So I'd like to ask if you haven't done so recently that you sit down this week and write us a letter and then close a gift as large as you can to help in the Bible Hour Television ministry.
[time=725] Once again when you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort
[time=731] Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=734] If you've appreciated these messages this summer, dealing with the very crucial issues that face our nation, we'd like to hear from you.
[time=741] We have spent a great deal of time and effort to prepare these messages so that you will be armed with the truth.
[time=747] We'd like to help you any way we can as you respond to these messages.
[time=751] We appreciate your prayer and your support and we'd like to hear from you this week.
[time=756] If you want to have the free Bible study material sent to your home, you can call us at 1-800-4539000.
[time=763] If you're writing to encourage us with your prayer and gifts, please write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=774] Now I hope you'll stay tuned for a very crucial message on the subject is homosexuality and
[time=781] alternate lifestyle.
[time=783] We'll be dealing with that from the Scripture in a few moments and I hope you won't leave until we've covered all the material from the Word of God that deals with that very crucial issue in our day.
[time=808] King John, King John, King John, King John, King John, King John, King John, King John,
[time=834] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=844] - Oh, that's good singing.
[time=847] You may be seated.
[time=849] And just before the message, Keith and Blake are going to sing for us again, give attention to their ministry and music.
[time=857] (piano music)
[time=865] [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=1029] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1042] Now you can see why we're trying to get him to transfer back here.
[time=1047] [AMEN] Let's bow together in prayer, shall we?
[time=1054] Our Father in Heaven as we come to this part of our service where we open the Word of God, we pray that we shall be faithful to what it says.
[time=1065] We ask that even as we have heard a few moments ago, grace of God will be in and through all that spoke in this morning.
[time=1077] We thank you that we can speak the truth in love and that as we speak,
[time=1083] our ministry of speaking can be seasoned with salt and grace.
[time=1092] We pray that you will allow your Holy Spirit to use this message today to
[time=1098] confront, to convict, to bring men and women to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,
[time=1104] to inform us of what we ought to know and what we ought to do in this present day.
[time=1110] Lord, by the Holy Spirit, open our hearts to the truth.
[time=1115] And Lord, fill my life and speak through me during this hour that I might be your instrument to perform your will, for I pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1129] I am speaking today on the subject is homosexuality and alternate lifestyle.
[time=1137] During the course of the message, we will be dealing with a number of passages of Scripture, so I encourage you to have your Bibles ready.
[time=1144] And as I give the reference that you first of all write it down and if you have the opportunity, find that reference and look it up and study it with me.
[time=1154] The subject is homosexuality and alternate lifestyle.
[time=1162] Homosexuality is almost as old as man.
[time=1166] The very first mention of it in recorded history concerns a lot in the well-known cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1174] Over 4,000 years ago, that event took place.
[time=1178] The word sodomy, which our dictionary defines as men practicing sex with men, has become a byword for homosexuality and it is obviously derived from that ancient city which was the first mention of the sin.
[time=1192] Certainly there have been homosexuals in America since the early days of our country, but you and I are living in the age when militant open homosexuality is being flaunted among us and before us.
[time=1207] All of that is a recent development.
[time=1210] The homosexual revolution began in the United States of America according to most experts in the summer of 1969 in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.
[time=1220] 400 gays flooded the streets for several nights to protest police raids on the
[time=1226] stone wall in a homosexual bar on Christopher Street.
[time=1231] The anti-Vietnam civil rights and women's rights movements all helped to galvanize the gays into thinking that they too could make a claim on society for recognition of their basic rights and for their point of view.
[time=1247] From that date until the present, the gays have been on the march making in roads into almost every segment of society.
[time=1256] The following, which have been gleaned from much of the literature of our day illustrate how many advances the gay rights movement has made just in recent days.
[time=1266] For instance, homosexual men and women are coming out of the closet as never before to live openly.
[time=1272] They are colonizing areas of big cities as their own territory, operating bars and advertised gay clubs in both large and small towns.
[time=1282] The Blue Boy, a magazine, something like a homosexual playboy is published by
[time=1289] Donald Enbinder, a 44-year-old gay publisher, and at the last check the circulation of that magazine was over 135,000.
[time=1299] According to the Institute of Sex Research, which was founded by Kinsey, it is estimated that homosexuals constitute 10% of the United States population, 13% of the males and 5% of the females.
[time=1314] According to Kinsey, only 1% of the homosexuals are out of the closet.
[time=1318] The rest of them are known only to themselves and perhaps a few trusted friends.
[time=1325] By way of parentheses, I need to mention that the Kinsey reports, which have been the source of most sexual information since 1948, are suspect to say the least.
[time=1336] They're really more propaganda than scientific investigation.
[time=1340] The Kinsey reports popularized and encouraged promiscuity, and they're based upon an anti-God and anti-moral foundation.
[time=1348] But nonetheless, they do give us some information as to the predominance and growth of homosexuality in our country.
[time=1357] Today, there are 39 cities, towns, and counties, including Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis, which have enacted ordinances forbidding discrimination against homosexuals and jobs in housing.
[time=1369] To the credit of the opponents of the gay movement, only five of these cities have been added to the list in the past two years.
[time=1377] And just as recently as 1979, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted down a gay rights bill.
[time=1384] In 1979, the Civil Service Commission, responding to a federal court decision, issued guidelines stating that people could not be denied federal employment solely because of homosexuality.
[time=1396] The FBI and the CIA are still holding out, and the Defense Department clings to a hard-line policy that known homosexuals are separated
[time=1406] from the military service.
[time=1410] There are now 120 major national corporations, including AT&T and IBM, which have announced that they do not discriminate in hiring or promoting people because they're homosexuals.
[time=1422] TV and movies are treating gay themes more openly and sympathetically. ABC's hit series Soap, for example, had two homosexual characters, one of which was a macho football player. The Harvard Law School will now not allow any law firms that discriminate against homosexuals to use its placement service for employment interviews.
[time=1446] In San Francisco, where homosexuals are flocking by the thousands from all over the country to Castro Street and Hade Asbury, gays are being recruited for the police department.
[time=1458] Today, Washington, D.C. has over 80 homosexual organizations, and Boston with 70 even has a club for overweight lesbians.
[time=1470] In Boston, the Homophile Community Health Service provides psychological counseling for gays, who fear that straight doctors will tell them that the source of all gay problems is their homosexuality, so they've created their own source of information.
[time=1486] The Metropolitan Community Church, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, has 110 congregations and missionary stations throughout the United States, including one in our city of Fort Wayne.
[time=1502] They even send out missionaries to establish new places in Canada and in Europe. Gay rights legislation is being sought that would elevate homosexuality to normalcy, along with heterosexuality, that would give gays increased leverage to secure jobs on a quota basis, force the military and public schools to hire avowed homosexuals, and make it impossible for even church organizations to fire a homosexual if they discovered that by accident they had hired one. The United Methodist Church's highest legal agency last month upheld the appointment of practicing homosexual Paul Ables as pastor of New York City's Washington Square Church. These are just a few of the happenings in the gay world, as inroads are being made into our culture.
[time=1550] By this, quote-unquote, "alternate lifestyle." But men and women, all of this in our culture, must be examined against the biblical information which we have.
[time=1562] Wall be to the individual who thinks that he may reinterpret his conduct in light of what's happening in the world.
[time=1570] Unfortunately, that's what's happening in many of our churches today. We have taken the absolute information of the Word of God and we have said, well, that's old information. That was for that culture back then and we're living in a modern day so we must take this information and reinterpret it in light of how we live today and we have subsequently taken God's absolutes and we have made them relative and we have said that it doesn't matter that God said, "Thus saith the Lord." What we're interested in is "Thus saith the Lord" interpreted by our culture and by the church. So I think it's important that we as Christians know what the Word of God really does have to say.
[time=1610] And I'd like to ask you that you begin with me in the Old Testament in the book of Genesis and the first chapter and in the 27th verse.
[time=1618] Here we read that when God created the world, he established a fundamental distinction within the human race reflected in the human body.
[time=1630] Male and female created he/them says Genesis 1-27.
[time=1634] It is repeated in the very same language in chapter 5 and verse 2 of Genesis. It was God's plan for sexual differentiation.
[time=1646] It was God's plan for sexual relations to be in the form of man, woman, union. Man and wife becoming one flesh Genesis 2-24. The distinction between the sexes cannot be explained apart from that fact.
[time=1662] God does not create man alone. Neither does he create man for man or woman for woman. God creates man as male and female and only in community together is the image of God seen upon the earth. Homosexuals and their defenders who argue that all human beings have the right to self-understanding and expression reflect their determination to ignore God's design and replace his intended distinctions with their own desires. One of the best books that has been written on this subject from a biblical viewpoint is Greg Banson's book Homosexuality, a biblical view. In his book he puts it into perspective in the following way. He writes, "Because man's sexual identity is defined by God because his orientation is ordained by God and because his sexual activity is circumscribed within heterosexual marriage context, homosexuality cannot be viewed merely as a variant sexual preference like being left-handed. It is not a third natural sex or alternative sexual orientation in God's diverse world. Instead it represents a choice in some sense to set one's desires and satisfy one's physical drives in a way which is contrary to God's appointment and creation.
[time=1746] There is no natural homosexuality.
[time=1750] For homosexuality is precisely a perversion of nature understood as God's design for human relations.
[time=1758] Homosexuals are made not born. Their disorder is developed contrary to their God-given identity, learned in opposition to the created order, pursued in defiance of the marriage ordinance. The biblical account of creation destroys the homosexual's defense. In light of God's word, in general, and Genesis in particular, homosexuality is a severely perverted condition.
[time=1786] We continue in the book of Genesis to the 19th chapter of the book of Genesis in the story of Sodom. In the story of Sodom, according to the record, the men of Sodom demanded that the two guests of Lot be brought out that the Sodomites might know them. Genesis 19, verse 5.
[time=1802] The result of this activity by the citizens of Sodom was the smiting of the Sodomites with blindness and the destruction of the city by fire and brimstone. In the 16th chapter of the book of Ezekiel, there are other sins mentioned beside homosexuality that made up the general wickedness of the city of Sodom.
[time=1822] When you have time you'll want to read Ezekiel 16, 49, and 50, where we're told that pride, fullness of bread, full idleness, and fail to help the poor and needy, were among the sins that God judged, but one cannot deny that the ultimate sin for which Sodom was destroyed was the sin of homosexuality.
[time=1842] It was the abomination of homosexuality that caused the judgment of God. This was the mark of their extreme rebellion and degradation. For 20 centuries, this has been the position of the church.
[time=1858] Calvin, Luther, Barth, Brown, Driver, and Briggs, Hebrew lexicons of the Old Testament, Bruce Metzger, all have understood this passage to teach exactly that.
[time=1870] But in 1955, Derek Bailey, an Anglican homosexual defied the view of two millennia of Orthodox consensus and he said that to know in this 19th chapter meant to get acquainted with. John Jay McNeil, an avowed homosexual and Catholic priest, popularized the view through his book, The Church and the Homosexual. Now according to this view, when the inhabitants of Sodom requested that lot's guess come out of the house that they might know them, what they really wanted was to get acquainted with them.
[time=1910] They rest the scriptures from their normal interpretation by making the sin of the saints to be the sin of inhospatality.
[time=1918] According to their view, the word Yaddah, which is translated by the word no, did not refer to knowing sexually but rather simply meant to get acquainted with. According to this theory, the Lord reduced this city to ash because of the lack of love and social courtesy. This humanistic view of the incident will not stand the test of scholarly investigation.
[time=1942] First of all, lot's response to their request argues against such a view. Lot classed their request to know his guest as great wickedness, Genesis 19, 6, and 7. You'll see it in the text. And he slammed the door to keep the lusting inhabitants from Sodom from getting their prey.
[time=1966] Secondly, those who interpret no as get acquainted with cannot explain the very obvious use of that term in the text to mean sexual intimacy. Now there is a very basic law of Bible interpretation that says, if a word is uncertain, you will oftentimes find the meaning of that word in the very context word is used.
[time=1986] And here in this text we are given the definition of the term no.
[time=1990] For we are told that Lot described his daughters as ones who had not known man.
[time=1998] Are we to assume that they had grown to adulthood and had never been acquainted with a man? Had never been introduced to a male? The homosexual interpreters explain Lot's offer of his daughter as sexual bribery.
[time=2014] But they cannot do that. For you cannot use the word no in one part of the text as meaning to get acquainted with and turn around in just the next verse and use it again to mean sexual activity.
[time=2026] The fact of the matter is the word yada in this text on both occasion means sexual intimacy. And if it can never mean that, all of us are in trouble because we're told that Adam knew his wife and that's how this human race began. And if that isn't true, we aren't here.
[time=2044] Men and women Sodom was obliterated because it was a city full of homosexuals who day after day practiced their sensual abominations.
[time=2052] Their homosexual sin according to Paul even was a sin worthy of death, Romans 1.32.
[time=2060] The Bible leaves no doubt about the nature of this sin. If we had just Genesis 19 all by itself, someone might still doubt.
[time=2068] But it is characteristic of the Lord in his teaching us and revealing himself to us that when there is a passage of Scripture which is possibly to be disputed, he will always make it clear somewhere else in the Bible and thus he is done. In that little book that proceeds the book of Revelation in the New Testament in the book of Jude and in the seventh verse of that book, he gives to us his commentary on Sodom and Gomorrah. And we read in Jude verse 70's words, even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth in example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. The word translated fornication in Jude 7 is the word echpornuane. It is intensive, points to extravagant lust.
[time=2120] The words giving themselves over to translate the word apelthusai which means the absolute abandonment to impurity.
[time=2128] The words strange flesh refer to unnatural sexual intercourse with someone of the same sex.
[time=2136] And God says that what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah was that the city was destroyed for homosexuality.
[time=2144] Along with God's specific marriage ordinance found in the first chapter of Genesis and the record of the destruction of Sodom found in the 19th chapter of the book of Genesis we also have several clear statements in the law of God as revealed in the Old Testament. Turn in your Bibles to the book of Leviticus where we are told in Leviticus 18 verse 22 the following, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with women kind, it is an abomination." Continue on in that same chapter to the 24th verse. Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things, for in all these are the nations defiled which I cast out before you.
[time=2188] Verse 30 continues, "Therefore shall ye keep my ordinance that ye commit not any of these abominable things." Leviticus chapter 20 and verse 13 further underscores this sin. "If a man also lie with mankind as he lieeth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination, they shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them." Leviticus 20 verse 13, "From the law of God, his verdict on homosexuality is clear." Now some argue that these statements from the Old Testament law are not binding on us today. Recently one of our young people gave me a homosexual tract that had been handed him on the campus of Indiana Purdue Extension. This homosexual tract was distributed by the gay community on the Indiana Purdue campus.
[time=2244] It is a tract entitled Homosexuality, what the Bible does and does not say. It is published by the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches in Los Angeles, California.
[time=2256] The tract attempts to refute the biblical prohibitions against homosexuality. In one section they try to deal with the passages from the Old Testament law that we have just read.
[time=2268] And I quote from their own literature, "Anyone who is concerned about this prohibition should read the whole chapter or the whole book of Leviticus. No pork, no lobster, no shrimp, no oysters, no eating blood, no rare meats, no inner breeding of cattle and a whole host of other laws." The problem however with such an easy answer is obvious to an honest student of the Bible.
[time=2296] The ceremonial laws and the dietary laws of the Old Testament have been abrogated for the Christian.
[time=2304] By the obedience of Christ in his redemptive work, all of these Old Testament ceremonial laws have been completely fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ. Christ came to take away the first that he might establish the second. These were the shadow which Christ is the substance. Every Bible student recognizes the category of temporary ceremonial law in the Old Testament. But the sleight of hand trick of the homosexual exegete is the assigning of homosexuality to the category of ceremonial law. It does not picture the person and work of Christ in any sense.
[time=2344] In Israel, homosexuality was punishable by death and therefore it was clearly categorized as a moral law and thus it was not temporary. The Bible never changes God's revealed moral law about this subject. In fact, as we shall see in a moment, the New Testament underscores that it is an abiding truth for today. Though the Old Testament law is not a way of salvation nor is it the means of being right with God, it is a revelation of God's unchanging and righteous will for his people.
[time=2380] When we come to the New Testament, sometimes it is argued that Jesus never mentored homosexuality in the Gospels and therefore it must be all right.
[time=2392] Now if one wants to justify something on the basis that it is not mentioned in the Gospels, all of us could create our own list.
[time=2400] The age-old argument from silence can be mighty handy when one is on the wrong side of the truth. The fact is, however, that when Jesus spoke about human sexuality, he always presupposed heterosexuality. When he was teaching, for instance, the meaning of the Bill of Divorce in the 19th chapter of the book of Matthew, he wrote, "Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them, male and female, and said, for this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one. So they are no longer two but one. What therefore God has joined together, let no man put us under Matthew 19, 4 through 6." In a recent conversation with a homosexual leader, he reminded us that heterosexuality was God's plan at the beginning because of his need to populate the world, but that he is allowed for homosexuality because of the population explosion. We cannot deny the fact that Matthew reiterates and reaffirms and underscores and underlines that God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, never changed his mind about his plan for the family.
[time=2476] Romans chapter 1.
[time=2480] First chapter of Romans has been called the "Devolution of Man" by some.
[time=2488] It contains the declaration of God's righteousness and it pronounces God's wrath upon all who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=2496] Now men and women, Romans 1 is the most devastating passage in the Bible for practicing homosexuals. Here Paul teaches that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against those who turn from their proper relationship to the Creator, holding down the truth of God and practicing idolatry. Because they do this, says Paul, "God gives them over to impure lusts and the dishonoring of their bodies." It is a solemn truth that we all must remember that men who give up God are sometimes given up by God to wander in moral pollution.
[time=2540] That moral perversion called "homosexuality" is described in this passage by the following terms should be noted by everyone who reads Romans 1. In Romans 1 24 it is described as impurity and dishonoring the body. In Romans 1 26 it is described as degrading passions. In Romans 1 27 it is described by the terms indecent acts or shameless deeds and error. The improper activity of a depraved mind is the way it's described in 128.
[time=2576] The exchanging of the natural use of sex for the end natural in 126 and 27 therefore worthy of death, Romans 1 32.
[time=2588] Now folks according to Paul, homosexuality is the cultural culmination of rebellion against God. It is symptomatic of a society under judgment, inwardly corrupted to the point of impending collapse. Paul regarded it as the most overt evidence of the degeneracy to which God in his wrath gave up nations.
[time=2612] Even in the face of such clear evidence from the Bible gay apologists tried to exist.
[time=2620] Bailey and McNeil, who I mentioned earlier as scholars of the homosexual ranks, assert that Paul was condemning in Romans 1 homosexual lust and homosexual promiscuity in the same way that heterosexual lust and heterosexual promiscuity is wrong, so it is wrong homosexuality. They also suggest that when Paul talked about natural relations in 126 and 27 he was referring to the individual person's natural affectional preference. Thus in their view if a homosexual was to do what was natural for him he must love a person of the same sex. To do otherwise would be for him unnatural.
[time=2664] One could hardly seek to identify an illustration of Paul's assessment of gay theology any better than the one I've just used. For Paul said the gay theology is arrived at according to verse 25 of Romans 1 in the following way read it carefully. They exchange the truth of God for a lie.
[time=2692] Amen and women, whenever you exchange God's truth for something else, for anything else you are set free to drift on a sea of relativity according to the Bible this is not an option. In 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 and 10 the subject is referred to again.
[time=2716] We read in 1 Corinthians chapter 6, 9 and 10, do not be deceived neither the immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor homosexuals will inherit the kingdom of God 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10. Here Paul uses two Greek words to refer to homosexuality. Malachia and Arsenakoytai these two words were used consistently by Greek authors to apply to the full spectrum of homosexuality. Only the wildest of just speculation can avoid the conclusion that Paul knew exactly what he meant and he also knew how it would be understood by those who would read what he wrote.
[time=2764] In the first chapter of Timothy verses 8 through 10 it is mentioned again. In 1 Timothy 1, 8 Paul repeats his theme from the earlier text in Corinthians. He says that the law is good if it is used to help us recognize sin and to come to Christ for repentance. But he goes on to say in verses 9 and 10 that the law was made for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for the immoral persons and for them that defile themselves with mankind.
[time=2796] Here again is the same word used as the word in 1 Corinthians. Arsenakoytai which is translated by some modern translations with the word "state" or "homosexual." Once again in this passage the homosexual finds himself in very bad company.
[time=2816] Thus as we examine the word of God we discover that from Genesis to Leviticus from the original creation to the destruction of Sodom to the holy law of God the message is consistently the same.
[time=2836] From Christ's statement on marriage in the Gospels to Paul's clear statements against homosexuality in Romans, Corinthians, and Timothy we learn that God created man male and female and that man is to be fulfilled in faithful heterosexual relations within marriage. It is the same in every culture and it is binding today.
[time=2864] Now in light of the overwhelming information about what is happening in the gay liberation movement and the survey of what God says in his word what should our attitude and position as Christians be?
[time=2880] There are several things that I want to say to you in conclusion this morning 6 in fact that I feel to be very important conclusions from our study.
[time=2890] First of all, we must refuse to allow the exponents of the gay movement to put us on the defensive.
[time=2898] It is the homosexual who has stepped out of the revealed will of God not the sincere Christian. More than ever before the moral Christian is being asked to defend himself against the unwarranted accusations of the homosexual community. Someone has said that it is not a real Christian.
[time=2918] Someone has said that we are the recipients of rhetorical terrorism.
[time=2926] You say pastor what do you mean? Well let me give you two examples.
[time=2930] We are told that to be against homosexuality is to demonstrate a lack of love.
[time=2938] C.S. Lewis once said in a book that I have that to ask that God's love be content with us as we are is to ask that God cease to be God because he is what he is. His love must in the nature of things be impeded and repelled by certain stains in our present character. And because he already loves us he must labor to make us lovable.
[time=2962] Love is at stake here folks.
[time=2966] We must choose either to love sin or to love God. If we choose to love God the Bible says we will keep his commandments.
[time=2978] Another way that we are often accused as evangelicals is that if we judge a homosexual or his homosexuality to be wrong then we are nothing more than bigots. And thus we displease the Lord.
[time=2994] But men and women viewing something as immoral is not the same as being a bigot.
[time=3002] For instance is it customary to look on someone who condemns the killing of innocent people as a bigot toward murderers?
[time=3010] Certainly not.
[time=3014] But it's one of the ways that we are taken off of the offensive for what God says and put on the defensive to answer the questions of those who are violating God's standards.
[time=3022] The second thing I want to say is this. Not only must we refuse to allow the exponents of the gay movement to put us on the defensive. Secondly we must refrain from any attempt to reinterpret the biblical evidence in light of our present culture.
[time=3038] When our doctrine is adjusted by humanity when it is adjusted by human wisdom or our examination of human behavior we have destroyed the only authority God has given us to guide our lives.
[time=3054] If it is possible to reinterpret the scripture to endorse homosexuality then we can make it endorse anything anyone would like to do or be.
[time=3066] It is important that we base our practice upon our doctrine and not our doctrine upon our practice.
[time=3074] Our standards men and women are defined by the word of God.
[time=3082] We can accept those standards or we can reject them but we cannot tamper with them.
[time=3090] We have no such option. For you see what is at stake here is not gay rights but God's rights and God said this is the way it is going to be and we have no right to change what God has said.
[time=3102] He is the creator. We are the creature remember?
[time=3106] Number three.
[time=3114] We must reject totally the idea that one can be a spirit filled Christian and a practicing homosexual at the same time.
[time=3122] Even in magazines that I respect like Christianity today are leaving the door open for homosexual Christians. The biblical evidence will not allow this. It is improper to call someone a practicing homosexual Christian.
[time=3146] You see it is impossible to enter the kingdom while rejecting and violating the standards of the king. You cannot maintain your integrity if you condone what God condemns.
[time=3158] To recognize a gay church for instance as a church in the biblical sense of the word is to degrade the term church beyond words. You might as well have churches for fornicators, churches for adulterers, churches for murderers, churches for robbers and any other kind of deviance that you can think of.
[time=3178] The church is called to bring back the straying sheep. We are not called to say to the straying sheep you're okay. You're okay in your wanderings and your devious paths are alternate lifestyles which God puts his stamp of approval upon. That is not being honest and it is not an option we have before God.
[time=3202] Number four. We must resist as Christian citizens the attempts that are being made on the local and national levels to normalize or legalize homosexuality.
[time=3214] It is not possible to give the militant gays what they want without sentencing millions of youth to a lifetime of misery.
[time=3222] This is a price too high to pay.
[time=3226] It violates the moral standards of God it is destructive to our country and it is in opposition to the best interest of our youth.
[time=3234] Dr. Charles W. Cicardi is clinical professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York and a leading authority on the treatment of homosexuality warned. I quote. There's no doubt in my mind that if homosexuality is further normalized and raised to a level of complete social acceptability there will be a tremendous rise in the incidence of homosexuality. It would have dire effects on society. Homosexuality militates against the family. It drives the sexes in opposite directions and it neglects the child's growth and sexual identity within the home.
[time=3270] Number five. We must recognize the relationship between homosexuality and inadequate home life. Now everyone listen to this carefully.
[time=3282] Dominant mothers and hostile or absentee fathers are creating an environment for homosexuality in our country. Dr. Irving Bieber studied the family backgrounds of 106 male homosexuals. According to his discoveries 81 mothers were dominating, 62 were over protective, 66 made the homosexual their favorite child, 82 of the fathers spent very little time with their sons, and 79 were maintained a detached attitude toward them.
[time=3314] Dr. Tim Blahay has said in his book on homosexuality that the best way to stamp out homosexuality in this country is to get back to the business of making parenthood a priority. Children raised in loving, well disciplined homes where mother and father are good role models for their children rarely become homosexuals.
[time=3334] Number six. And certainly not least, but it's last because of the importance of the appeal.
[time=3342] We must reach out compassionately to those who are struggling to be free of the sin of homosexuality.
[time=3350] Like Christ, we must have compassion on the center while at the same time we are condemning the sin. Dr.
[time=3358] Melvin and Chell said that whoever decided to call homosexuals gay must have had a terrible sense of humor, for they are not gay, only fearful, struggling, guilty, often depressed, suicide-prone people. And they are folks for whom Christ died, people for whom he shed his blood. And while we are condemning the sin and doing all we can to restrain its growth in our society, we must remember that like anyone else for the homosexual, Jesus Christ is the only hope. It is interesting to me that in the three passages we have read in the New Testament about homosexuals, in every passage there is hope for the homosexual in the context. It says in I Corinthians 6, 11, right after talking about this, that such were some of you, but you are washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[time=3414] Jesus Christ holds out hope for the homosexual who will repent and ask for forgiveness and accept as their Savior, and He will do it for you, wherever you might be, if you will ask Him to do it.
