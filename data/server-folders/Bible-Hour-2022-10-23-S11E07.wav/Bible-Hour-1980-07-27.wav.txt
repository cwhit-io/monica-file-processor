[time=7] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, he presents the Bible with master David Jerron [phonetic]
[time=17] [ Singing ]
[time=36] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=41] >> We're very happy to welcome you to this worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=45] This is the second hour of Morning Worship here at the Black Hawk Sanctuary.
[time=50] And we're grateful that you could join us, both those of you who are with us here in the auditorium and our many friends who have joined us by way of television.
[time=58] During this summer, we are dealing with some of the very controversial issues that face us
[time=64] in our nation and in just a few moments.
[time=67] I'm going to be sharing with you a message on the subject is abortion murder.
[time=74] And I hope that you will listen carefully throughout the message to hear what God would say to all of us in such an hour as this.
[time=82] We're so very happy that as a part of our ministry today, we welcome back to the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=88] and old friend Paul Schumacher will be singing for us in just a few moments.
[time=92] I know you'll appreciate his ministry.
[time=94] He was the very first guest we ever had on the television program when it started several years ago.
[time=100] And we're glad he could be with us today.
[time=102] Right now, we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=106] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=264] Way back when the television ministry began here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church over in the Chapel building.
[time=270] We first invited Mr. Paul Schumacher to come and share with us musically.
[time=274] And he was the first musical guest that ever sang on the Bible hour, which was then the Heritage Hour.
[time=282] And he's come back many times to reacquaint us with his ministry and to bless us with his music.
[time=289] He's with us this morning to share with us musically and we welcome him back to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=294] And I know that his ministry will be a blessing to your hearts.
[time=298] [MUSIC - 242 seconds]
[time=556] We're so happy that you joined us in the Bible hour today.
[time=559] Donna, my wife and I have the wonderful privilege of taking some time out of our service to talk with you about the Bible hour ministry
[time=567] and all that's going on to be of service and ministry to you at home.
[time=571] Donna, we have been talking for the last few weeks about a special little booklet that has received a very, very exciting response from our friends at home,
[time=580] a little booklet that you have in your hand called the answer book.
[time=583] I believe God is using that.
[time=585] I know he's promised to do that because it's filled with the Scripture.
[time=588] That's right. All it is actually is a reprint of the Scriptures in topical order and if you have a question or if you're studying a particular area, say on anxiety or comfort, perhaps courage,
[time=602] all you need to do is take that topic and look under that topic in the book and it will give you the Scriptures printed out that deal with that particular subject.
[time=612] It's a handy tool to have if you are counseling with a friend who perhaps has a problem or if you just happen to have a question in your own life about some spiritual issue,
[time=623] all you need to do is just pick up this little booklet.
[time=626] It's small and handy. You can just stick it in the back of your Bible and then turn to the passage that is your concern at that time.
[time=634] We would like to send you a free copy of the answer book and in order to get your free copy, all you need to do is pick up your telephone and call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=647] Ask for the Bible our operator and share with her that you would like your free copy of the answer book and she will get in touch with us and we will get it in the mail to you right away.
[time=657] If you prefer, you may write to us and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 8, 1, 5.
[time=668] But we do hope that we'll hear from you this week either by phone or in the written mail.
[time=673] Donna, I have just had the wonderful privilege this week of following along in the daily walk ministry in the book of Isaiah.
[time=681] The daily walk is another tool that God has put in our hands to share with you. It's a monthly Bible study guide that is coordinated for a yearly plan.
[time=690] By that I mean each month you get a book that keeps you on track to read through the entire Bible in one year.
[time=697] During this particular time we're reading through the Old Testament and we've come through some very rich passages in the book of Isaiah.
[time=703] I don't know if you underline in your Bible but I found myself underlining some of the key verses in those chapters because they were such a tremendous blessing to me.
[time=712] Now the daily walk gives you an assignment for each day and then coordinates that assignment with a commentary or an explanation of the passage and then of course it also has some charts to help you see how the whole fits together.
[time=724] I know that the daily walk is being used in the lives of many people to enhance their own spiritual growth and perhaps it could be God's way of getting you into the word into the Bible for your own personal study.
[time=736] We'd like to introduce the daily walk into your life. We'd be happy to send you this month's issue if you'll just get in touch with us.
[time=743] Once again I want to give that number that Donna shared with us a few moments ago it's 1-800-453-9000. That is a toll-free number from any place in the United States.
[time=753] For those of you who have just recently joined us through the National Christian Network or they're in Springfield Dayton we'd like to hear from you especially because we'd like to know that you're a part of our listening audience.
[time=764] If you'll take just a moment to call us at that toll-free number and request the Bible study guides we'll be happy to put them in the mail to you right away.
[time=772] And of course if you'd like to write we'd sure like to hear from you. During the summer months when the mail drops a little bit it's always an encouragement to have a letter from new people who've never written to us before.
[time=782] So if you're going to write to us please write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=792] Now in just a few moments I'm going to be talking about this subject is abortion murder. It is one of the most controversial subjects in our country today.
[time=802] And I hope you'll stay with us because I'm anxious for as many people as possible to hear what God has to say from his word on this very crucial issue.
[time=812] Before we go back to the service however let me let us remind you again of the way you can avail yourself of these special Bible study guides.
[time=820] Donna give them the phone number and the address and help them remember again how they can get in touch with us.
[time=826] That toll free number again is 1-800-453-9000 and that number is not only available just during this hour it's available any time of the week that you might like to call us.
[time=837] And our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=847] And we really would encourage you to get in touch with us this week. Sometimes we feel like maybe this is a one-sided conversation and we wonder if there's anybody out there.
[time=855] And it's a real encouragement to us when we hear from you.
[time=859] We hope you'll stay with us now as we go back to our service Paul Schumacher is going to be singing again and then we'll be opening the Word of God for today's message.
[time=885] The more you've given me your love and pulled me out the more my praise is not enough.
[time=909] You say he who would go first go last.
[time=921] Now I pray that you'll be first in all I ask.
[time=934] The highest praise more than spoken words it's what my heart would say.
[time=945] All I have to offer you in my small way is to live for you.
[time=960] The highest praise not to see yet believe you died for me.
[time=970] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently for all you do.
[time=985] The highest praise I could give today is to give my life to you.
[time=1015] Father if you had asked for some great name I would have tried and yet you only wanted me.
[time=1043] The highest praise more than spoken words it's what my heart would say.
[time=1054] All I have to offer you in my small way is to live for you.
[time=1069] The highest praise not to see yet believe you died for me.
[time=1080] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently for all you do.
[time=1095] The highest praise I could give today is to give my life.
[time=1114] Is to give my life is to give my life to you.
[time=1144] Many of you are following along with us in reading through the Bible and what we call the daily walk.
[time=1151] Over these past days we've been in the book of Isaiah where there are some tremendous promises that just jump off the page especially when you're going through some difficult times.
[time=1163] One of my favorite passages in Isaiah is the 43rd chapter where we're told when now passes through the waters I will be with thee.
[time=1173] And through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God.
[time=1185] Fear not for I am with thee and I will bring thee back to thy desired habitation.
[time=1193] This promise from the book of Isaiah is the basis for a wonderful musical truth that Paul is going to share with us.
[time=1200] Anyone here going through any storms, any difficulties, any problems, listen with your heart to the ministry of this song.
[time=1219] When this old world that I've been living in collapses at my feet when my life is shattered torn
[time=1240] though I'm windswept and battered yet I can cling to his cross I find peace in the midst of my stone
[time=1259] for there is peace in the midst of my stone tossed life there's an anchor there's a rock I can stand upon
[time=1279] for Jesus says my vessel and I feel no alarm he gives me peace in the midst of my stone
[time=1303] when in twenty four short hours years of living come down to moments when life's final picture comes into view
[time=1323] in the dark room of my suffering there's a light come shining through God gives me peace in the midst of my stone
[time=1344] when my body has been broken to crack with pain and misery when my doctors have done their best yet look for long
[time=1365] in the dark room of my suffering there's a light come shining through he gives me peace right in the midst of my stone
[time=1384] there is peace in the midst of my stone tossed life there's an anchor there's a rock I can stand upon for Jesus says my vessel
[time=1409] and I feel no alarm no alarm he gives me peace in the midst of my stone
[time=1437] peace in the midst of my stone
[time=1465] and I feel no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm no alarm
[time=1493] let's pray together shall we father in heaven we confess without apology that we need your strength everyday of our lives not a one of us here not a one
[time=1507] hearing my voice has managed to escape the storms that come once in a while into our experience we don't like them we rebel against them sometimes
[time=1519] we fail to see that God has a purpose in them to conform us unto the image of his own son and sometimes we get so concerned with the difficulty we fail to look around and realize that in the midst of the storm is our savior
[time=1533] so anxiously waiting to help and encourage us if we'll just look in the right direction we thank you that as we come to this particular subject of the day we need not lean upon our own understanding or our own wisdom
[time=1548] but we can trust fully in the Lord to give us direction and guidance we pray that these words strong words will be heard Lord through this message penetrate the barriers that we have constructed around us because of the acceptance in society of a very evil thing
[time=1569] cause us to be aware cause us Lord to be a flame with the righteousness of God in this day for we pray in Jesus name and for his sake amen
[time=1582] I'm speaking today on the subject is abortion murder every 24 hours 3,600 American babies are aborted that is 1.32 million per year and it's all perfectly legal the courts have declared abortion and American freedom
[time=1609] we don't even call it abortion anymore we call it post-conceptive fertility control
[time=1619] the feminists call it voluntary miscarriage and every woman's right pro-lifers call it murder and I'm embarrassed to say that most evangelicals call it none of my business
[time=1634] in 1969 the American Law Institute proposed a law that would allow abortion in cases of rape, incest or a threat to life or health of the mother or in cases of grave defect in the child
[time=1648] in 1969 the National Association for the repeal of abortion laws formed and led the fight for abortion on demand Bernard Nathanson a medical doctor and Betty Frieden gave leadership
[time=1663] as a parenthesis may I say that Bernard Nathanson presided over the largest abortion clinic in the United States and later after witnessing what he saw there day after day
[time=1675] denounced his previous stand in favor of abortion and came out vocally against it writing one of the most often referred to books against abortion called aborting America
[time=1690] on July 1, 1970 Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed a law allowing licensed physicians to perform abortions through the 24th week of pregnancy and New York City became an abortion capital
[time=1705] in 1972 in the Roe versus Wade case Janet Roe filed a suit to overturn a Texas law prohibiting her right to have an abortion
[time=1715] the court ruled against her wish since her life was not in danger but on January 26, 1973 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Texas court decision was unconstitutional
[time=1730] and therefore canceled abortion laws in all 50 states about this same time there was another case that came to the courts a case known as Doe versus Bolton and as the result of that case other abortion limiting provisions were ruled unconstitutional
[time=1749] plus every restriction against abortion on demand was removed in our country one month after the Roe versus Wade case the pro-abortion faction petitioned the federal courts to order city and state hospitals to provide abortions for the poor and require that the state charge their abortions to the federal Medicaid program
[time=1772] said yes and began to do it on September of 1976 Henry Hyde a Republican from Illinois proposed the Hyde Amendment which restricted federal funding of abortion to those necessary to save the life of the mother
[time=1790] but in January of 1980 the U.S. District Judge John F. Dooley Jr. of Brooklyn, New York declared that the Hyde Amendment was unconstitutional and he rescinded it
[time=1802] now the Supreme Court has ruled that the Hyde Amendment is not unconstitutional and unfortunate thing about the Hyde Amendment is that it is not a law which maintains its power year after year but it is a law which has to be reenacted every year because it is a law which requires funding
[time=1820] and so every year the battle over the Hyde Amendment comes to the courts and every year the forces line up to fight for or against it
[time=1829] now the question about abortion that requires all of our attention is Christians and that draws the line of battle is summarized in a statement by a man named Paul Jewett who has written in a book published by the American Medical Society
[time=1846] in which he asks this question this marvelously endowed creature called man whose intelligence reduces remote galaxies and minute atoms to the laws of reason who lives in the realm of responsibility knowing the commendation of a good conscience and the condemnation of an evil one who as Luther said in his highest and noblest part is qualified to lay hold of the incomprehensible
[time=1875] invisible and eternal in short to become the house where faith and God's word are a home is this man is he or is he not while still in his mother's womb a man a person
[time=1892] studying history it's interesting to note that Turtullian was the first theologian who ever dared speak out on this subject many many hundreds of years ago Turtullian wrote that Christians abominate as murder both infanticide and abortion the latter being a kind of murder in advance
[time=1910] for the embryonic man is as the fruit to the blossoms said Turtullian destined in a little while to become a perfect man if nature meets no disturbance
[time=1921] as far back as 1450 and 1250 BC the Assyrians had a law on abortion in fact history tells us that the Assyrian law prescribed death on the torture rack for a woman who procured an abortion for herself
[time=1939] but this is all history this is all past what does the word of God say to us today it is interesting to me that as you read the scripture there are not a lot of passages that deal in a very specific way with the subject
[time=1957] but the overall tenor of the word of God is very clear first of all when we read the scripture we learn that the Bible asserts that conception is a gift from God
[time=1969] Eve at the birth of Cain declared that she had received him from the Lord Genesis 4-1
[time=1975] Sarah's belief that the Lord had restrained her from bearing Genesis 16-2 was confirmed when Abraham later received the divine assurance that she would have a son Genesis 17-19
[time=1990] taking pity on Leah the Lord opened her womb Genesis 29-31 as he also did for Rachel Genesis 30-22
[time=2002] of Ruth it is recorded that the Lord gave her conception Ruth chapter 4 verse 13
[time=2008] now I understand that conception comes because of a man and a woman but men and women let me tell you that is a gift from God
[time=2018] when my wife and I were first married for almost eight years we had no children we prayed and prayed that God would give us children
[time=2028] we moved to Fort Wayne and God gave us the wonderful privilege of adopting our first daughter
[time=2034] back in the state of New Jersey was a dear old woman her name will not be familiar to most of you but those of you in this congregation know that she was Jim Elliot's mother
[time=2046] she went home to be with the Lord just a few days ago one day she came to me and she said pastor I have taken it as my assignment to pray children into your family
[time=2056] and I promise you that every day I shall pray for children and every day she prayed
[time=2062] as soon as Jan came along just in a very few weeks we discovered that David was next in line
[time=2069] and we knew Mrs. Ealy was praying and after David came along before too long God sent to us Jennifer
[time=2077] and I remember calling Mrs. Ealy and asking her if she might not slow down her prayer life just a bit
[time=2084] we are very aware of the fact that children are a gift from God the Bible says that the Bible teaches that
[time=2094] and as we read the scripture we discover that God is actively involved in fashioning the fetus within the womb
[time=2101] if you have your Bibles with you will you turn with me to Janet to Psalm 139 Psalm 139
[time=2111] and in the thirteenth verse of Psalm 139 we read these words of David
[time=2118] for thou hast possessed my inward parts thou hast covered me in my mother's womb
[time=2125] I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well
[time=2133] my substance was not hidden from thee when I was made in secret and intricately wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[time=2140] thine eyes did see my substance yet being unformed and in thy book all my members were written
[time=2147] which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them
[time=2157] if I should count them they are more a number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee
[time=2163] the phrase in this particular passage that is translated lowest parts of the earth is a Hebrew expression to describe the dark interior of the womb
[time=2174] the thrust of the passage that I have read from the 139th Psalm is clear
[time=2180] it is principally to confess a truth about God but it also says something about David the psalmist
[time=2187] it says that he regarded himself as having been a self even before he was conscious of himself
[time=2196] I the person was covered by the hand of God in my mother's womb I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the inner recesses of my mother's body so says David
[time=2209] and in that passage of scripture in his confession David destroys any opportunity anyone would have to say
[time=2217] that life does not begin until birth and that a person is not a person until his birthday
[time=2224] David teaches us that a person is a person in the womb of his mother
[time=2230] we find support for this elsewhere in the Old Testament book of Job in the 10th chapter in verses 8 through 12
[time=2237] where Job and struggling with the condition of his own life said thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet doubt us destroy me remember I beseech thee
[time=2248] that thou hast made me as the clay and will thou bring me into dust again thou hast clothed me with skin and with flesh and has fenced me with bones and sinews
[time=2261] thou has granted me life and favor and thy care hath preserved my spirit Job said this flesh and this skin and the structure of these bones and these sinews
[time=2272] Lord you did that you made me in my mother's womb I am a product of God
[time=2279] thou we can understand the means that God uses to cause a child to grow in the security of a mother's womb
[time=2288] the Bible says that actively involved in every child is the hand of an almighty God who is fashioning that child
[time=2294] after his own image for the purpose of his own glory Prophet Zechariah in the 12th chapter of his book and verse 1 said the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel
[time=2306] saith the Lord who stretcheth forth the heavens who layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him according to the prophet the formation of the spirit of a man within him
[time=2320] is a work of God that is equal in comparison to the foundation of the earth and the stretching forth of the heavens
[time=2328] I don't know if you've looked in the mirror recently and understood that truth
[time=2335] but as tired as you may be and as old as you may be and as rundown as you may be
[time=2341] when you look in the mirror you ought to say God I am a product of your creation thank you for making me as I am
[time=2348] I am the child of your hand the story of the incarnation supports that theory you know how when Mary was found with child gods
[time=2361] and is angel to talk to Joseph and the angel told Joseph that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit
[time=2370] from the moment of conception God entered that life did you hear it that which is born no
[time=2379] that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit God lived within the person of Jesus Christ
[time=2388] within the womb of his earthly mother and I understand all of the theological ramifications of God
[time=2394] coming into the world as a person being born in a different way than we are but I also understand the truth of that passage that says that the new kind of life he embodied started
[time=2407] when the Holy Spirit implanted him within the womb of his mother
[time=2416] I read this week a very interesting letter from a Canadian pastor who wrote in the United Church of Canada
[time=2424] Renewal Fellowship paper thought it was very interesting how he expressed this
[time=2430] he said Jesus said let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of God
[time=2437] you see he wrote the destiny of every child conceived in the womb is the kingdom of God
[time=2443] in God's eyes children are not conceived to add to Canada's natural resources
[time=2449] they're not conceived for a life of Burgoy's middle-aged selfishness they're not conceived to play in bed and in cars hurtling to nowhere
[time=2460] the intention of God for every child conceived in the womb is that he grow up into God's kingdom
[time=2466] now we recognize that doesn't happen but God is not willing that any should perish but that all should come unto him it is the intention of God for that one in the womb that he grow to live in Christ in living in Christ he passed one day through the portals of death into life everlasting with God himself
[time=2486] this is why Jesus said see that you do not despise even one of these little ones
[time=2493] passage of scripture which is the battleground for the discussion of abortion among those who claim to believe
[time=2502] the word of God is found in the book of Exodus chapter 21 if you have your Bibles it would do well for you to turn there this is a very interesting passage because this passage is used by those who claim that abortion is permissible under the law of God
[time=2516] and it is also used by those who deny abortion as being permissible in the law of God obviously the interpretation needs to be very clear in Exodus 21 verse 22 we read these words if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her meeting that she lose her baby
[time=2539] and yet no mischief follows he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine Exodus 21 22
[time=2554] and if any mischief follows then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe
[time=2567] now some say that this text proves that God doesn't regard the unborn child in the same way that he regards a newborn child
[time=2577] they understand the passage to say that if something happens to the child that there is no penalty of life for that accident
[time=2585] but if you study the text carefully you will find that if a man in an argument with another man accidentally strikes a woman and she has a premature birth there is to be a fine nothing here is premeditated
[time=2598] it is an accident the birth is okay but if any further mischief is done according to the next verse such as the deformity of the baby or the death of the baby
[time=2609] then the old law applies and what is that old law an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[time=2615] theologian Francis Schaeffer the greatest theologian of our time in the evangelical world
[time=2621] checked the exegesis of these verses with the five leading Hebrew scholars in our world today
[time=2627] and he said that each and every one of them returned the same exegesis of this passage exactly as it has been explained this morning
[time=2635] in other words the book of Exodus does not downgrade the worth of an unborn child
[time=2641] but rather it supports that child as a human being the penalty for whose death according to Old Testament law was the death of the person inflicting it
[time=2650] now these passages of scripture are just a few of the passages that hold up the dignity of human life
[time=2660] as I've discussed this issue and thought about it and prayed about it and read about it and talked to people about it
[time=2667] I felt that the last half of my message this morning based upon what we have discussed in terms of the importance of life before what we know is birth
[time=2675] having explained that that our procedure ought to be to take a few moments and discuss some of the arguments that are being used today
[time=2683] and sadly enough being believed by many untaught Christians to support abortion as the right of every woman
[time=2691] first of all there are many around who tell us that abortion is necessary in our world today because of special situations
[time=2706] the law that we talked about earlier was started quote unquote for those special situations Everett C. Coop who cooperated with Francis Shafer and producing the film that we shall see here tonight
[time=2717] it's a pediatric surgeon for 37 years and is made an exhaustive study of this subject
[time=2723] and he points out that abortions in this country for rape, incest, to protect the life of the mother
[time=2729] or to avoid a defective fetus comprised less than 5% of all the abortions that are performed
[time=2735] the rest are just for convenience and we're talking about 1 million abortions per year
[time=2743] rape almost never results in a pregnancy studies in Pennsylvania and Minnesota concerning rape and pregnancy show that as many as 5,000 rapes have occurred successfully without a single pregnancy and the protection of the life of the mother is a smokescreen Dr. Coop has practiced pediatric surgery for 37 years and he said that in his entire career
[time=2766] he does not know of one single instance where the child had to be aborted to save the mother's life not one
[time=2773] and yet if you talk to the pro-abortionist today they talk about the fact this is a terrible plague that's sweeping our country and because of all of this evidence abortion must be a part of our culture
[time=2784] number two abortion is merely the termination of a pregnancy that's what I hear when I talk to these folks termination of a pregnancy is a euphemism, do you know what a euphemism is?
[time=2798] a euphemism is a phrase which allows us to deal with abortion in the abstract
[time=2807] it is a phrase which disguises the truth for it implies that abortion is a victimless procedure
[time=2814] and thus involves us in verbal beating around the bush termination of pregnancy is far more acceptable to one's conscience than to poison mutilator shred pre-born babies
[time=2827] words like this produce images that brutalize our senses and our emotions
[time=2836] that's the purpose of a euphemism to substitute language whereby we can name things without calling up mental pictures of what they really mean
[time=2845] we play games with ourselves the intent of abortion is the elimination of a small but very real human body in ways which are tolerable
[time=2858] because we need not see them with our physical or mental eyes termination of pregnancy as a euphemism for any of the violent procedures which kill unborn children
[time=2868] fails to convey the fact that abortion does not take place on the body of the mother
[time=2874] although she obviously is involved indeed abortion does not take place on a condition such as pregnancy
[time=2882] although pregnancy is obviously altered because of it but abortion in its reality is that it kills an innocent human being
[time=2892] termination of pregnancy anesthethesizes us to the pain of the action for clearly it is the life of the unborn child
[time=2900] which is terminated do you see how we've played that little game we changed the wording to make it more acceptable to us
[time=2910] number three one of the most popular phrases especially among politicians and legislators is this one
[time=2919] abortion is wrong but every person should have the right to choose for themselves
[time=2925] listen to a parable a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves
[time=2934] who stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
[time=2940] and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he thought well I wouldn't rob a traveler myself but I suppose the right of others to choose and he passed by on the other side
[time=2955] and likewise a Levite when he was at that place came and looked on him and he thought every man should be a wanted man
[time=2962] and obviously this man wasn't a wanted man and so he passed by on the other side
[time=2969] but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
[time=2976] and history has forever called him good not until he had set aside his plans and his schedule for another
[time=2983] not until he had sacrificed his time and his treasure for one in need not until he had risked his own safety and perhaps even his life and trying to save that person could he be good
[time=2995] I reject with everything within me the statement that I don't believe in it but it's all right for everybody else
[time=3002] that would be my saying to you folks I want you to know that I've come to the deep conviction that murder is a sin
[time=3008] now that's my own personal decision my own personal choice but I want you to know that it's up to you to make that decision for yourself
[time=3015] and whatever you choose to do I will grant you the privilege to carry out your wishes even if it involves my own family
[time=3025] number four if abortion is not allowed to be legalized child abuse will grow this is that age old slogan every child a wanted child
[time=3038] it is supposed to be kinder to the unborn child to abort it than to allow it to be born and possibly suffer mistreatment
[time=3045] those who fought for liberalized abortion policies have had their way and since 1970 it is conservatively estimated
[time=3053] that in the United States there are probably over six million fewer children who would now be between the ages of one and seven
[time=3061] since these six million were unwanted and supposedly would have been prime targets for child abuse
[time=3068] it would seem reasonable to look for a sharp drop in child abuse in this same period but in fact since the legalization of abortion on demand child abuse has grown remarkably and it is not due to more efficient reporting
[time=3084] the reasoning behind this ought to be clear to every straight thinking person Dr. Harold O. J. Brown who was written a book called Death Before Birth Observes
[time=3096] that perhaps unconsciously American people exposed to legalized abortion reason I didn't have to have him
[time=3105] I could have killed him before he was born so if I want to knock him around now that he is born isn't that my right
[time=3113] and you can chart it as abortions have gone up child abuse has gone up
[time=3120] you'd be overwhelmed to hear the reasons why abortion is permissible according to the law
[time=3126] in the Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton decisions in 1973 the Supreme Court provided examples of factors which would guide women
[time=3134] in concluding that a child was unwanted and therefore abortable now get this if the child might force upon the woman a distressful life or future
[time=3148] if the woman might be taxed by child care I have four children and I'm taxed by all of them
[time=3157] if she would experience embarrassment as the result of being an unwed mother or if the birth of a child would deprive the woman of her preferred lifestyle
[time=3167] there isn't a mother present who hasn't at times feel like I felt like perhaps those children have altered her lifestyle but gladly she has sacrificed for that because she has seen the joy
[time=3178] that's involved in bringing children to fruition in the nurture and admonition of the Lord if we follow these guidelines for abortion there is not a person alive who does not have at one time or another a legitimate reason for it
[time=3196] number five every woman has a right to control her own body so they tell us
[time=3202] 1976 the women who were supporting abortion in Rome had a rally and one woman carried a card with this statement on it
[time=3212] the body is not to be managed by the doctor and even less by God the womb is mine and I manage it all by myself
[time=3221] sounds logical every woman has the right to control her own body and I would say that in most of the cases of abortion I would agree wholeheartedly
[time=3236] the best control for many women who have unwanted children outside of marriage who seek abortions would be to say no to the man who got her pregnant
[time=3246] and that way control her own body someone has said that the most effective contraceptive available today is an oral contraceptive it's spelled NO
[time=3256] she has the right to control her own body do we believe that why I don't think even the abortionists believe that
[time=3269] you know why they don't believe it because they say in one breath every woman has the right to control her own body and then in the next breath they support taking that right away from little women who live in the womb
[time=3283] do big women have the right to control their own body why the little women who were born who are yet to be born in the womb don't have that right men and women in closing let me say that unless we do something in this country about that problem
[time=3300] in fantasized now practiced illegally behind closed doors will become legal and eventually for certain types of deformity may be mandatory Dr. C. Everett Coop has said that in ten years it may be difficult for a Christian physician to practice medicine in this country as a matter of conscience
[time=3317] we're not talking here about a legislative problem we're not talking here about a decision that we may all make up our mind about we're talking about the ruthless slaughtering of millions of human lives under the protection of our law
[time=3336] because we have not come to grips with the fact that life begins in the womb not in the hospital in closing let me read to you the diary of an unborn child May 5th
[time=3351] Today my life began my parents do not know yet I am as small as a seed of an apple a little sprout probably my sex and color of eyes is already settled May 19th it's the 14th day some think I'm not a real person yet I'm not a loaf of bread but I am a weak crumb
[time=3368] May 23rd the 18th day my mouth is just beginning to open now just think in a year so I shall be laughing and later talking I know what my first word will be it will be mama June 2nd the 28th day I am growing a bit every day my arms and legs are beginning to take shape someday I shall climb up and hug my mommy and daddy
[time=3389] June 12th the 38th day tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands funny how small they are I'll be able to stroke my mother's hair with them July 10th it's the 66th day my hair is growing it is smooth and bright and shiny wonder what kind of hair mom has
[time=3409] June 24th it's the 80th day I wonder if mom hears the whispering of my heart some children are born a little sick but my heart strong and healthy it beats so evenly you'll have a healthy baby mommy July 28th it's the 84th day today my mother killed me
