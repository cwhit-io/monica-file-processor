[time=44] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=50] And we welcome you to this service.
[time=52] This is the second hour service from the Black Hawk Baptist Church, meeting here in the auditorium here in Fort Wayne and sharing this service with our many friends through television, here in this area, and in the other places where the Bible Hour is seen.
[time=65] We're grateful that you've chosen to be with us.
[time=67] We trust that the Minister of Music and the spoken word will be a blessing to your heart.
[time=72] Few moments I'm going to be speaking on the subject is the new morality, really immorality.
[time=79] We'll be looking at some passages from the Word of God and examining of current philosophy of our day.
[time=84] I hope that your hearts will be open to that which we have to say.
[time=87] Right now, let's listen to the music of our choir.
[time=90] [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=281] Thank you, choir.
[time=282] One of the young men who sings in our Black Hawk Singers and also in the men's quartet is a fellow who is going to sing for us later this morning, David Miller.
[time=291] Comes from a musical family.
[time=293] His sister is a merrily-sneck.
[time=295] She lives in Toledo, Ohio.
[time=297] She is a fine vocalist.
[time=299] And when we found out that she would be visiting with her brother this week, we imposed upon her to share with us in song.
[time=305] She's being accompanied at the piano by a long time, Fort Wainer moved to Toledo, Mrs. Keith Scholes.
[time=313] And some of you remember her.
[time=315] She has been here before.
[time=316] Please listen carefully to the ministry of Merrily.
[time=319] [MUSIC]
[time=329] Let me see this world, dear Lord, as though I were looking through your eyes
[time=348] and the world of men don't run too long, but a world more rigid to die.
[time=369] Let me live with you in the garden.
[time=406] Let me live with you for faith only.
[time=413] [MUSIC]
[time=420] Let me see this world, dear Lord, through your eyes.
[time=432] Let me live with you in the garden.
[time=461] Let me stand high upon my petty problems.
[time=471] And breathe for men to come out, return on me.
[time=483] Or if once I could see this world the way you say.
[time=496] I just know I'd serve you for every day to leave.
[time=513] Let me see this world, dear Lord.
[time=521] Let me see this world.
[time=535] We really do appreciate you joining us for the Bible, our television program today.
[time=539] We're counting on this being a very special time in your life as we talk together about the subject of the new morality.
[time=546] It's really not new, it's old, but we're going to discuss it under the term that the world uses, and we're going to be opening the Word of God to do that in just a few moments.
[time=554] Right now we want to talk to you about how you can get involved with us in the Bible, our television ministry.
[time=560] I'd like to take this opportunity while Donna and I have the privilege of sitting together to talk with you, to share with you as I would if I were seated right in your own home, the need that we have at this time.
[time=571] It's so easy for us during the summer season as we get involved in vacations and summer activities to forget about the ministries that God has used in our lives to encourage and help us.
[time=581] And I have to be honest with you that at this particular time the Bible, our faces some very difficult times financially simply because of the drop in letters and communication during the summer hours.
[time=593] I'd like to ask all of you who really believe in the Bible, our ministry to take a moment this week and drop a note to us to let us know you're still with us in your prayer and financial support.
[time=603] These summer messages have been very draining to all of us as we've addressed these topics.
[time=608] Many of you have written to encourage us, but many more should be writing during these days if we're going to continue to go forward aggressively in spreading the gospel through the Bible, our television ministry.
[time=619] That's something that all of you can do for us this week. You can sit down and write and that will be such an encouragement.
[time=625] You cannot know what a blessing and encouragement that will be to us.
[time=629] We encourage you to do that today while it's fresh in your mind.
[time=632] In just a moment Donna will give you the address where you can write and let us know you're a part of the team.
[time=638] Donna, we have not only shared the gospel through the Bible, our television ministry, but we continue to work hard at providing materials that will help people in their own spiritual growth.
[time=648] And one of the keys to our spiritual growth is being in the Word of God on a regular basis.
[time=654] And that's why we have been offering the daily walk because the daily walk does just that.
[time=660] It gets you into the Word day by day in a regular systematic study program.
[time=665] And we would like to send you a free copy of the daily walk so that you may join the many, many people who are following through this program.
[time=674] One of the nice things about the daily walk is that you can jump in at any time of the year.
[time=679] And then if you read for one year, you will finish the entire scriptures within that one year's period.
[time=684] And we'd be happy to send you your first copy of the daily walk on a free basis.
[time=690] If you would just call us at our toll free number 1-800-4539000 or write to us.
[time=697] We always are encouraged when we receive letters from you and you share with us that you are watching the Bible hour and it's ministering to you.
[time=706] And our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=715] And it's very important that we hear from you this week.
[time=718] And when you write or call, we will be happy to send you the daily walk if you will just request it.
[time=724] Donna, when we send the daily walk to our friends, we'd like to also send them a free copy of the little booklet, the answer book, that includes some scripture references in topical form.
[time=734] It will be of great help to you in your own personal walk with the Lord.
[time=737] The answer book is a little booklet that I put together, especially for our television family, to help them find the scriptures they need to know about when they're studying the Word of God, helping other people in their struggles or just looking for answers for their own spiritual lives.
[time=752] The answer book is a very helpful tool that you will find useful in your life day by day.
[time=757] The answer book in the daily walk, just another means that we have of extending God's truth to you through the Bible hour.
[time=764] We'd be so very happy to send them both to you this week.
[time=767] If you'll just call us at 1-800-45-39000, absolutely free call from any place in the United States
[time=774] and you can call any day of the week, day or night, our Bible hour operators are ready to hear from you.
[time=779] Or you may write to us at post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and make your requests known to us at that time.
[time=786] Once again, before we go back to the service, let me urge each and every one of you to do your very best to communicate to us this week.
[time=793] We need to hear from you.
[time=794] We hope you'll take time to write us and we'll be looking forward to your letter this week in the Bible hour mailbox.
[time=800] Now we're going back to our morning service in just a few moments.
[time=803] I'm going to be speaking on the subject is the new morality, immorality.
[time=809] I hope you'll stay with us as we explore that subject in detail on today's edition of the Bible hour television program.
[time=833] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=1295] â™ª
[time=1306] Thank you, David. I want you to open your Bibles this morning to the Book of Matthew and the fifth chapter.
[time=1313] I want us to read in unison verses 17 and 18, Matthew chapter 5 verses 17 and 18.
[time=1322] I'm speaking today on the subject is the new morality, really immorality.
[time=1331] One of the claims of the new moralist is that the Old Testament Decalogue, the law God's will to man has been done away.
[time=1339] We live on the other side of that and we have no responsibility to the commandments of Christ, to the Old Testament law or to any moral codes.
[time=1348] Let us read together, Matthew chapter 5 verses 17 and 18, let us read out loud together this portion of God's holy word.
[time=1357] Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfill.
[time=1366] For barely I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no way pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
[time=1379] Shall we pray together? God in heaven, in these moments that lie before us, we pray that you will take control of our minds and our hearts,
[time=1389] that the truth that is communicated will be perceived and understood and applied.
[time=1395] We ask our father that if there are those among us, either here in this auditorium or in our wider congregation through television,
[time=1402] who whether they know it or not are practicing the new morality, that you will convict their hearts of sin and of judgment, cause them to understand that God has a word for them from his holy word,
[time=1415] a revelation from God which we call the Bible.
[time=1419] Lord, make them ready to receive what the Spirit of God would communicate to each life, for we pray in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1429] Is the new morality really immorality?
[time=1435] In 1966, Joseph Fletcher, who was the Professor of Social Ethics at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
[time=1446] wrote a book called Situation Ethics, which took the world of theology and philosophy by storm.
[time=1455] It was a book in essence that people were waiting to have written.
[time=1460] For in this book, which is considered to be the Bible to the new morality people,
[time=1466] Fletcher spells out in clear, cut terms what it means to practice Situation Ethics.
[time=1475] In essence, he says that all codes and rules and laws such as the Ten Commandments are outmoded.
[time=1483] They are obsolete and therefore they are not binding on mankind.
[time=1488] According to Fletcher, the only authoritative law that man is responsible to obey is the law of love.
[time=1497] He presents a methodology for making decisions that frees man up from responsibility to any biblical precepts at all.
[time=1507] Fletcher's thesis, which comes through in all of his writings, is that men must apply the law of love to each situation in which they find themselves.
[time=1517] According to his view, in a given situation, lying, premarital sex, abortion, even murder could be right.
[time=1531] Most all of his illustrations that he uses to prove his point are illustrations that we might consider to be exceptional.
[time=1538] By that I mean rather strange and unlikely happenings.
[time=1543] They require a moral decision and Fletcher applies his unique system of rules to making that decision.
[time=1551] Most all of his illustrations have to do with fornication, adultery, rape or abortion.
[time=1557] Therefore Fletcher has often been associated with the sexual revolution in our country and throughout the world.
[time=1566] One illustration that Fletcher uses in his book is a very unique story about a woman by the name of Mrs. Bergmeyer.
[time=1573] Mrs. Bergmeyer, according to the story, is in prison because of war.
[time=1578] Her husband also had been in prison but he escaped and he was free.
[time=1582] Mrs. Bergmeyer was in prison while her husband was caring for the children and their family.
[time=1591] According to the story, she wrestled deeply with the problem of her husband trying to care for these children while working and supporting them,
[time=1599] obviously desired greatly to be free from her imprisonment.
[time=1603] Then according to Fletcher's illustration, one day the guard who was responsible for her gave her an alternative.
[time=1611] He said, "If you will commit adultery with me, I will guarantee that you be set free and you will be allowed to go back to your family."
[time=1619] According to the story, Mrs. Bergmeyer considered carefully the opportunity to do a loving thing in order that she might return to her family.
[time=1628] And according to the story, she committed adultery and was returned to her home.
[time=1633] Fletcher tells us that that in that situation was the right thing to do.
[time=1638] Now it's very interesting how he reasons.
[time=1641] It is very interesting how even Christians, unless they think carefully, could reason that that would be acceptable conduct.
[time=1648] One of the problems that Fletcher has as he explains his "morality" is that he leaves out some of the facts that have a tendency to change the story.
[time=1659] He says this was a good act on the part of Mrs. Bergmeyer, but one cannot help but ask these questions.
[time=1667] What if the wife of the soldier who committed adultery with Mrs. Bergmeyer were included in the record?
[time=1674] I wonder if she would consider it to be a kind and loving act perpetrated for the purpose of a greater good.
[time=1681] What of the husband who later on in life finds out that in order to be to him what she desired to be, he discovers that his wife was sexually unfaithful to him?
[time=1693] What of the good or evil that comes from such an experience?
[time=1698] So you see in Fletcher's morality, he chooses to make his own laws and his own rules, and he carves out a special place for doing what one pleases.
[time=1708] Probably you're thinking as I tell you this story, but Pastor, I never heard of Joseph Fletcher, and I don't even know what the new morality is.
[time=1717] I don't know what situation ethics is all about, and so I'm not sure what all this has to do with me.
[time=1725] When a young person says, as you have no doubt heard them say, what I do is my own business, as long as I don't hurt anyone,
[time=1735] that person is talking the language of the new morality and the situation ethics.
[time=1740] When two college people decide that they will live together without the benefit of a lawful marriage, those two college young people have decided that they will obey the ethics of the new morality.
[time=1754] So you see, we are not far removed from what all of this philosophy means in our generation.
[time=1759] I could not help but think as I was preparing this message that this philosophy is underneath many of the topics that we have been discussing all summer long.
[time=1768] For instance, one of the arguments for the support of abortion is that every child ought to be a wanted child.
[time=1774] Therefore, if a child is scheduled to be born into a situation where it may not be wanted, the pro-abortionist reason that it is the loving thing to take that child's life before it is born.
[time=1786] If a man happens to have inclinations toward other men instead of toward women, he may reason in his own mind.
[time=1793] God created these desires within me and it is a loving thing for me to break the laws of humanity and relate to a man instead of a woman.
[time=1802] It is the loving thing, it is the right thing.
[time=1805] Underneath all of the moral changes that are taking place in our generation today is the subtle philosophy of situation ethics and the new morality.
[time=1813] By using Fletcher's system, anyone can justify any act, even if it is lying, theft, rape, fornication, adultery, incest, murder, on the grounds that he is doing it by acting responsibly in love according to that particular situation.
[time=1833] In Joseph Fletcher's book, he says there are only three ways that we can make moral decisions. The first way he calls legalism.
[time=1843] He says this is the approach that a man uses when he goes into a situation armed with a preset list of rules and laws by which he will make his decision.
[time=1853] According to Fletcher, the letter of the law reigns supreme and he places most evangelical Christians under this first category.
[time=1862] We are legalists, we have rules and laws and preset ideas by which we make decisions. Fletcher denies that as a loving way to deal with life.
[time=1871] The second approach that he uses is what he calls antinomianism. It is a long word which when broken down means to be against the law, anti-against gnomianism, the law.
[time=1881] And according to this philosophy, Fletcher says some people solve their problems without any rules, without any guides, without any principles.
[time=1888] They just do whatever comes naturally. The decision is the thing of the moment. Fletcher believes that he has solved the problem of the two extremes.
[time=1896] He is not a legalist, he is not an antinomianist. He is a situationist. And according to his philosophy, the way you deal with the problem is this.
[time=1905] You buy in to one basic law, the law of love. And in any given situation, you are able because of that law to change your mind about the quote unquote standards or rules or regulations and you continually make up your mind in each given situation on the basis of what is the loving thing to do.
[time=1925] Fletcher calls this the halfway house between legalism and antinomianism.
[time=1931] Enough of an introduction to help you understand what the new morality and situation ethics is all about.
[time=1937] May I say to you that Hugh Hefner and his playboy philosophy is an outgrowth of all of this. You would be interested to know that Hugh Hefner grew up in a very religious home.
[time=1947] And in his teenage years rebelled against everything he was taught and created a whole system of ethics just for himself which said, "Whatever I please is the loving thing to do."
[time=1958] As I was preparing this message this week, I was interested in the illustrations that seemed to abound on every hand.
[time=1964] One day I walked into the den and turned on the television. What greeted me was something I normally wouldn't have watched very long, a country and western music program.
[time=1974] But I indulged myself for just a few moments because the song was of interest because of that which I had been studying.
[time=1981] Now don't you country and western people get angry with me. That's just a way of expressing where I am.
[time=1988] A young lady was on the screen and she was singing these lyrics. It couldn't be sinning because it feels so right.
[time=1995] It couldn't be sinning because it seemed so good. The whole song was a philosophical portrayal of the new morality.
[time=2003] What she was saying is even though there is an outside law that says it's wrong, I know it can't be wrong because it just seems so right.
[time=2011] One of my favorite popular songs of this particular generation, one that I think has both beautiful melody and most of the words are okay too, is the song that Debbie Boone sang, "You Light Up My Life."
[time=2023] Some Christians have taken that and used it as an illustration of what Christ can mean in a person's life.
[time=2028] But I don't know if you listen to that song carefully. There is a phrase in that song which gives away its morality.
[time=2035] It says it can't be wrong. It feels so right.
[time=2041] Men and women, that's the philosophy of our generation.
[time=2044] That there are no absolutes. There are only those things which are right and wrong in and of themselves as we approach them in the given situation.
[time=2052] And so we have young people today who are turning their back upon the things which they have been taught as the absolutes of their life and they're saying, "I don't buy that anymore.
[time=2062] I believe that there are certain things which we have thought were wrong in the past which are right today under a certain set of circumstances."
[time=2070] Now, what's wrong with such a philosophy? Well, obviously, down underneath all of its wrongness is the fact that it violates the Word of God.
[time=2078] But let's examine it for just a moment because it is so crucial to the way we think in our generation.
[time=2083] First of all, it is wrong because it promotes a confusing concept of love.
[time=2089] The new moralist does not clearly define love. He is afraid to do that, but he speaks of good intentions and desirable consequences.
[time=2099] And thus he is saying that the end justifies the means.
[time=2104] But unless specific contentment in women is given to love and what it is, good intentions and good consequences can justify even the murderous acts of Hitler.
[time=2118] Fletcher speaks of love in terms of good actions, and he says that if a person does what they do with good intentions, then it's all right.
[time=2128] If a person does what he does and it creates a good consequence, then obviously it's all right.
[time=2133] Apart from whether or not it is morally or intrinsically right or wrong.
[time=2139] One who has written in opposition to the new morality uses the illustration of Joseph in the Old Testament.
[time=2145] In the 39th chapter of the book of Genesis, Joseph was propositioned by Pharaoh's wife.
[time=2151] And according to the record, Joseph did the right and noble thing. He refused.
[time=2156] And he ran out of the house, leaving his coat in the hands of Pharaoh's wife.
[time=2161] According to Fletcher, that was the right thing to do because it coincided with Joseph's desire of the moment to be pure and right and holy.
[time=2169] He did the right thing because he had good intentions.
[time=2173] But you know the rest of the story as well as I do.
[time=2176] Did his right quote unquote action promote good consequences for him?
[time=2181] And the obvious answer to that is no. Not if you look at it on the surface for the result of his quote unquote good intentioned act was that the consequence he faced was to be put in jail.
[time=2193] He was accused wrongly and he was put in prison.
[time=2197] So at one in the same time, Fletcher has to look at that particular situation and say, "Joseph did the right thing, good intentions."
[time=2204] But at the same time, he did the wrong thing, bad consequences.
[time=2208] And I don't know what that means to you or what it does to you, but it blows the circuits in my mind.
[time=2213] I can't comprehend how anything can be at one in the same time, both good and bad.
[time=2218] And when you throw the absolutes of the word of God out, that's what you're left with.
[time=2222] You're left with the confusing concept of love which a new moralist decides upon in a given situation.
[time=2230] I want you to take your Bibles and turn with me to the 22nd chapter of the Book of Matthew.
[time=2235] It is important that every Christian be very clear about the concept of love in the Bible.
[time=2242] For this whole matter of love seems to be the reigning and ruling guide for much of what is done today in opposition to God's standards.
[time=2252] I have heard young people say, "Well, it doesn't matter if we go to bed before we're married. We really love each other."
[time=2259] I've heard people who are married say, "But I don't really love her anymore."
[time=2265] So it's all right for me to step out of bounds and make love to someone else.
[time=2270] Even Christian people have their minds fogged up with what the Bible teaches about love and are using it to justify that which they know in their hearts is wrong.
[time=2282] One day a lawyer came to Jesus and he said, "Good Master, what is the great commandment?
[time=2288] What is the greatest of all the commandments?" In verses 37 and 38, Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[time=2299] and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." This is the first and the great commandment.
[time=2307] And the second is like it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." On these two commandments hang all the laws and the prophets.
[time=2317] Jesus Christ in that one summary statement gave both the content of all the Old Testament law and the priority of our love relationships.
[time=2327] Let me show you what I mean.
[time=2329] Find the book of Exodus in the Old Testament and the 20th chapter.
[time=2333] Here we have the giving of the Ten Commandments, the giving of the law.
[time=2338] I want you to notice in the 20th chapter as these commandments are given how they fall into the categories of the summary statement of Jesus Christ in Matthew,
[time=2346] in Matthew chapter 22.
[time=2350] Exodus chapter 20 verse 3, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Verse 4, "Thou shalt not make unto the any carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,
[time=2361] or that is in earth beneath, or that is in the water underneath the earth." Verse 7, "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." Verse 8, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Verse 12, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Verse 13, "Thou shalt not kill." Verse 14, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Verse 15, "Thou shalt not steal." Verse 16, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." And verse 17, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, or thy neighbor's house, nor his man-servant."
[time=2393] What is Jesus saying when he speaks in Matthew 22 about the whole law hanging on those two precepts?
[time=2400] Very clearly, he means this, "When he says that our first priority is to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts
[time=2407] and our minds and our souls, he is encompassing in that one statement the first four commandments of the Old Testament."
[time=2413] Notice what they say.
[time=2415] The first four commandments tell us were to have no other gods before him.
[time=2419] If we love him, we'll not do that.
[time=2421] We are not to make any images in his place.
[time=2423] If we love him, we'll not do that.
[time=2425] We are not to take the name of the Lord God in vain.
[time=2428] If we love him, we will not do that.
[time=2430] We are to remember the Sabbath day under the Old Testament code as a representative of the day when God rested.
[time=2436] If we loved him, then we would do that.
[time=2438] And men and women, though we cannot transfer that across to the New Testament.
[time=2441] If we love our Lord, we will have a special reverence for the Lord's day as well.
[time=2446] All of those have to do with the first statement, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart."
[time=2452] Now, what do the second six say?
[time=2455] Under the heading of that other statement in Matthew 22, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[time=2461] What would one expect of an individual who loved his neighbor as himself?
[time=2465] Well, he would expect that he would honor his father and mother understanding the word neighbor, meaning a personal relationship between two people.
[time=2473] He would understand that he should not kill.
[time=2475] One does not honor his neighbor by killing his neighbor.
[time=2478] He would understand that he would not commit adultery.
[time=2481] He would understand that he would not bear false witness against his neighbor.
[time=2484] He would understand that he would not covet that which belongs to his neighbor.
[time=2488] So you see, when Jesus Christ said there are two commandments, and on those two commandments, "Hang all the law and prophets," he was saying this, "Love God and love your neighbor." If you do that, understanding all that's involved in it, you will please the Lord.
[time=2501] That is the content of his statement.
[time=2504] But notice carefully that the priority of his statement is that we love God first and other second.
[time=2511] And Joseph Fletcher has never been able to understand that.
[time=2514] He says that we do the loving thing when we relate to it in the situation.
[time=2518] If we feel it's the loving thing to have an immoral relationship with someone else's wife, then in that situation it's all right.
[time=2526] But I would ask him and I would ask all of you who may follow his reasoning, "What about our love for God?"
[time=2532] God said, "Thou shalt not." And the Bible says, "When we love God, we keep his commandments." How can a person at one in the same time say he is doing the loving thing when he is violating the first priority which is to love God and to obey his commandment?
[time=2547] You see, when we make love the subjective rule of our life, we are able then to give it any meaning that we want to.
[time=2554] We can create our own definition.
[time=2556] And because of that, we can do whatever we please and somehow reason that God is smiling down over heaven at our activity.
[time=2564] The first thing that is wrong with the new morality is this.
[time=2568] It confuses the concept of love.
[time=2570] Secondly, it creates chaos in morality.
[time=2574] Because people have varying value systems and differing concepts of the loving thing, it cannot be an adequate guideline for moral actions.
[time=2584] For instance, some think money is greater, greater value than children.
[time=2590] Or prestige is more valuable than sexual purity.
[time=2593] The loving end chosen by people left to themselves is arbitrary and personal.
[time=2599] It is not uniform.
[time=2600] Thus there is no uniform code for morality.
[time=2603] A person just does what according to their system is okay.
[time=2606] A communist, a Catholic, a Puritan, a Christian, a Protestant and a Hindu can all be situations and feel like they are pleasing the Lord.
[time=2614] They are all doing the most loving thing in harmony with their system of values.
[time=2619] The crucial question is whose values are right and men and women we have a word from God about that.
[time=2627] I couldn't help but think how crazy this whole matter is as it relates to life.
[time=2635] How easily we apply to the spiritual realm what we would never apply to any other aspect of living.
[time=2643] One of the situationists who follows Fletcher's reasoning uses an illustration in his writings that I find quite interesting.
[time=2650] He alludes to the analogy of the Ten Commandments like they were the rules of strategy in athletic endeavors.
[time=2658] Now listen carefully. He says the Ten Commandments are like some of the rules of strategy in sports.
[time=2665] Like you pun on fourth down, you always take the three and oh pitch, you never throw a cross court pass.
[time=2673] He said the Ten Commandments are just like that.
[time=2676] There are maxims. He would call them not the Ten Commandments, the Ten Suggestions.
[time=2682] But wait a minute. That's not exactly right.
[time=2687] For good football teams, if they're adventurous, often pun on fourth down.
[time=2692] And George Foster very seldom takes a three and oh pitch.
[time=2697] And I've seen the very best of basketball players throw cross court passes behind their back.
[time=2705] If we're going to be fair with his analogy, we have to understand that there are some rules.
[time=2711] There is nothing illegal about swinging at a three and oh pitch or puning on the fourth down.
[time=2716] That's a maxim. But there are many rules in sports that are unbreakable.
[time=2722] Such as thou shalt not clip.
[time=2727] Thou shalt not tackle a punter while his leg beeth in the air.
[time=2735] Thou shalt not get more than three strikes nor four balls.
[time=2740] Thou shalt not get a home run when the ball goeth over the fence in foul territory.
[time=2745] All of those are rules of the game. Can you imagine trying to play an athletic endeavor without any rules?
[time=2755] This last winter I had the opportunity with my wife to attend one of the NBA playoff series out in Los Angeles.
[time=2763] And we got there plenty early. Just ask my wife she'll tell you how early we got there.
[time=2769] And so I had a chance to walk around. I walked all around the floor and I walked down there where they were practicing.
[time=2774] I couldn't believe the size of those guys. I mean that's a sport that's supposed to be speed but those men are huge.
[time=2781] And I watched the game carefully with the officials and how they try to keep it in control.
[time=2786] And if you know anything about the NBA playoffs you know that almost all of the time the game is just on the threshold of getting out of control.
[time=2795] Those guys go at each other and they just you know it's violent.
[time=2799] I just reasoned this week as I was studying for this machine.
[time=2802] Suppose the coach got together with the officials and they called all the players together and they said now men we're going to have this playoff game tonight.
[time=2810] I just want you to know there are no rules but we hope you will do the loving thing.
[time=2815] The loving thing to some of those guys I know would be to tear the head off of the opponent.
[time=2824] Stuff it in the basket with the ball.
[time=2828] You say pastor how ridiculous and I say amen how ridiculous.
[time=2832] You cannot play the game without a set of rules.
[time=2835] And why would we ever expect that God would call us to be involved in the game of life if he did not give us some rules.
[time=2842] Some inviolable rules by which we play the game.
[time=2846] And the reason he's given us those rules is so that we won't get hurt.
[time=2850] So that we won't hurt ourselves or other people or violate his standard of holiness.
[time=2855] Woebe to the man who takes it into his priority to be God to himself and others and says I don't care what he says I'm going to do my own thing.
[time=2863] And I'll justify it by calling it the loving thing.
[time=2868] It creates chaos in morality.
[time=2872] Thirdly it makes consistency impossible.
[time=2877] It's impossible to predict what's going to happen as a consequence.
[time=2882] It's impossible to know what's going to come of any situation.
[time=2886] And so when we say that we are going to do the loving thing and by that we mean we're going to do it with good intentions
[time=2893] and because of the good consequences we are assuming in our own minds and hearts that we know all things both actual and possible.
[time=2900] We not only know what we're going to do, but we know how it's going to turn out.
[time=2905] I wish you could come to the office of the pastor or the counselor and listen to the cries of people who started out with that philosophy.
[time=2912] Hear them respond to it.
[time=2914] Pastor, I didn't know it was going to be like this.
[time=2918] I had no idea I would create such a mess.
[time=2921] I didn't think it was going to hurt so many people.
[time=2924] I didn't know I was going to do this in such a way so that so many people would be hurt.
[time=2930] They started out with good intentions but they assumed they knew the consequences and they were wrong and what they thought was the right thing turned out to be the wrong thing.
[time=2938] In order to make a moral decision and make it properly without any guidelines you have to be omniscient.
[time=2946] You have to know not only what you're doing but the absolute outcome of that and make your decision based upon good intentions and the consequences.
[time=2955] You say, Pastor, that's impossible.
[time=2957] No, it isn't because somebody knows that.
[time=2962] He's the God in heaven.
[time=2964] He knows what your intentions ought to be and he knows what the consequences will be.
[time=2969] And so he has put up signposts along the way and he has said, "Thou shalt not," or "It's all right."
[time=2976] And yet Christians going down the road of trying to please God and at the same time please themselves have talked themselves into believing that they can ignore the signposts and still enjoy the consequences out here.
[time=2989] And it doesn't work.
[time=2991] It's interesting to me that when God created Adam and Eve,
[time=2997] he put them in the garden, perfect surrounding, the absolute image of God within them, no sin nature.
[time=3007] He gathered the two of them together one day and he said, "Now, Adam and Eve, perfect surroundings,
[time=3014] just make sure you always do the loving thing and it'll be okay." No, he didn't do that, did he? He gave them some instructions.
[time=3022] He said, "Replenish the earth, take care of the garden, thou shalt not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good in life."
[time=3032] The fact of the matter is that Adam and Eve were the first situation moralists.
[time=3036] If you really think about it carefully, when Adam and Eve saw the fruit, it looked good for food,
[time=3042] it was pleasant to the eyes, it was a fruit to be desired, it was to make one wise.
[time=3048] They ignored God's direct prohibition, they thought there was nothing inherently right in the commandments themselves, maybe they thought it naive to obey a law simply because God gave it to them.
[time=3059] So thinking that they had adequately evaluated the consequences, having reasoned that there could be nothing wrong with food, they made a loving calculation and they ate the fruit.
[time=3072] But the results were far more disastrous than they had imagined.
[time=3077] Sin entered the human race, the man, woman, and serpent were cursed, later their son Cain killed their son Abel
[time=3086] and thereby provided the pattern the human race has followed ever since.
[time=3090] Why? Because a man and a woman thought morality could be judged by the consequences
[time=3097] and thought they had the ability to calculate and predict them and they were wrong.
[time=3102] Note carefully that in the case of Adam and Eve, the goals which they had in mind were not corrupt.
[time=3113] You know what the Bible says they wanted? They wanted to be like God. That sounds good.
[time=3119] There's nothing really wrong with that. They wanted food.
[time=3124] But because they were limited by time and knowledge, they could not predict the catastrophe which awaited them.
[time=3130] Likewise, modern man loosed from the restrictions, wishes to be like the Almighty.
[time=3135] He will be doing what he wants to do, no matter what happens.
[time=3139] He will snatch from God the throne and the scepter. He will be like the most high. He will say, "I will."
[time=3145] But he cannot be confident that in the sleep of death, no unpleasant dreams will come.
[time=3154] The new morality, last but not least, refuses to consider the final judgment.
[time=3163] God's evaluation, according to the Bible, is not going to be on the basis of whether or not we did the loving thing.
[time=3173] Can you imagine a Christian who's been immoral all of his life standing before the judgment seat of Christ and saying, "But Lord,
[time=3181] I thought at the time it was the loving thing to do." The Bible teaches us that the basis of our judgment before the judgment seat of Christ as Christians will be whether or not we have done that which pleases the Lord in terms of our rewards.
[time=3197] And those who stand in unbelief before the white throne judgment of God, because they have not accepted Jesus Christ,
[time=3204] will be judged for their sin of rejecting Christ and all of the sins they committed in the process.
[time=3212] It seems only logical in the thinking of this speaker that if laws are needed and who can really deny this,
[time=3221] then serious consideration ought to be given to the laws by which Almighty God is going to judge and evaluate us.
[time=3228] God's ethical system which is given is for our benefit.
[time=3239] It is too bad that Christians don't understand that.
[time=3243] It is too bad that young people don't understand that.
[time=3246] It is too bad that people have forgotten that the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul.
[time=3252] And the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise and simple.
[time=3258] Psalm 119, 142 says, "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth."
[time=3266] Romans 7, 12 says, "Wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good."
[time=3272] God gave to us a directive for our lives.
[time=3278] It is an absolute directive.
[time=3280] It cannot be tempered by what we think or the situation we face.
[time=3285] Men and women, I am discovering as I'm sure you are, if you've walked with the Lord, there will be times in every one of our lives when we will be tempted to compromise what we know is right
[time=3295] because of the situation.
[time=3297] And there are times in our lives when we will do the right thing, and it will seem that bad consequences come.
[time=3304] But I am as confident of this truth as I am that I'm standing before you today that it is always right to do right, and it is never right to do wrong.
[time=3315] If you want a guideline to carry you through your life to victory in every situation
[time=3321] and to help you make decisions that will be honoring to the Lord and will protect you from hurt and harm, never forget that.
[time=3328] It is always right to do right, and it is never right to do wrong.
[time=3334] The numerality takes away the finality and the absolute nature of God's will
[time=3341] and sets us loose on a sea of uncertainty to do as they did in the Old Testament book of Judges.
[time=3348] Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
[time=3352] If you want a testimony of what happens when you follow that plan, I dare you to read that Old Testament book.
[time=3358] God has provided a plan for you, and you can follow it, if you will.
[time=3367] Let us pray together.
[time=3374] Our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed before we say goodbye to our television family.
[time=3379] Let me ask you to do this.
[time=3381] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you do not have any absolute plan for your life.
[time=3387] You're floating out there on that sea of uncertainty.
[time=3390] God loves you.
[time=3391] He wants to save you.
[time=3393] Give your life a new perspective.
[time=3395] He wants to forgive your sin.
[time=3397] Make the word of God come alive to you as a directive for your own personal walk with him.
[time=3403] Right now, if you will, you can accept him as your Savior.
[time=3407] You can bow before him and confess your sin and ask him to come into your life, and he'll do it.
[time=3413] Just pray God be merciful to me as sinner and save me for Jesus' sake, amen.
[time=3419] Father, we pray that many who watch this television program, as well as many here in this auditorium, will make that commitment to Christ today.
