[time=24] From the Convocation Center of the Black Dog Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and we welcome you to the morning service of the Black Dog Baptist Church.
[time=53] This is the second hour worship service coming from the Black Dog Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=58] So grateful for our many visitors who have joined us now and others who are joining us by way of television.
[time=64] Our special guest today is Mr. Bill Gaither.
[time=67] We're singing all of his music, and we're going to be talking to him in just a few moments.
[time=71] Right now, listen to our choir as they sing one of Bill's recent songs about the singing church.
[time=79] [MUSIC]
[time=89] [ Singing ]
[time=108] The singing singing is far now, it's too late to far now, when some things were sharing, were sharing, there is a song.
[time=134] There is a song, there is a song, there is a song.
[time=147] So when you're playing out and brand new, it wells out inside you and spreads out to others before long.
[time=165] And there's a year of stress, it will just have to express you to just be so full.
[time=179] [ Singing ]
[time=328] Thank you, choir, for that music.
[time=336] We are all indebted in the body of Christ to a man who has given us much of the music that we sing every day and in our church services.
[time=348] And I have almost everything I guess he's ever written, and it's been recorded by his group and a lot of other groups as well.
[time=355] And it's really our privilege and joy today to share with the congregation here at Blackhawk and with our friends at home.
[time=363] Unbelievable musician and songwriter, a great family man and a man of God and a friend of mine, I'm glad to say Mr. Bill Gaither.
[time=372] Bill, would you come and let's talk together. Let's give them a welcome, shall we?
[time=376] [ Applause ]
[time=386] Bill, we have pulpit guests quite often here, and it's quite characteristic in some other parts of the country to have pulpit guests who you don't know for sure where they are spiritually.
[time=396] So I always ask whoever it is, whether it's somebody that I know to be involved in Christian ministry or in politics or whatever, how did you come to know Christ?
[time=406] Dave, I grew up in the church in a little town south of Port Wayne here, a place called Alexandria.
[time=413] I've talked a lot about that. I tell people about 50 miles out of your way on the way to anywhere, just about.
[time=419] But I grew up in that church, and so many times I think it's very easy for kids who grew up in a Christian home just to love the warmth, the nest, and not realizing it somewhere along the way.
[time=433] You have to make a decision yourself to go the way of the cross crowd, and it was not until I was 19, a year after I was out of high school that I really got serious about this whole business of serving the Lord.
[time=446] I committed my life to the Lord after I was out of high school, realizing that a good Christian home, a good church, and a good, warm place to get my soul fed was not enough that somewhere along the way.
[time=458] Even though I often kid, I am not a converted wrestler.
[time=463] I never felt out of an airplane, and I don't have any great story to tell, but the day that I knelt before the Lord, before the cross, I was still as any other center coming to him and asking him to come into my life.
[time=475] Bill, you must have some place along the way gotten the impression that God wanted you to use music as the vehicle to share him with others. How did that happen?
[time=485] Interesting enough, and I sometimes even use my example as those who might be critical of at least some of the Christian music that comes down the scene.
[time=496] For us musicians, we have always been the battleground in the whole Christian church because there are so many different tastes within the body of Christ as to what is godly music and not godly music, and what kind of music God can really bless.
[time=509] But it was really through gospel music that really got my attention, even about serving the Lord.
[time=516] At first, I had just was drawn to it because of the warmth and the beauty and the excitement of the rhythms and that kind of thing, but I finally noticed that they were saying some very powerful words and messages that could make a difference in my life.
[time=529] And so all of a sudden, it was more than fun and games, it became a way of life.
[time=535] And I think after I gave my heart to the Lord and saw the power of music and then started using the music that was existing, there came a time where I felt like I wish there were a song that said, "Oh, church, sing on."
[time=549] Or I wish there were songs that said, "Because he lives I can face tomorrow and I couldn't find one in existence."
[time=555] And so I guess the Lord said, "Why don't you go right one?" And that's what you did.
[time=560] And that's what we did.
[time=561] And how many have you written?
[time=562] I think by the time of the other day we were maybe over 300 songs and in comparing it to Fanny Crosby, who has written, they said had written 3,000, maybe 4,000 songs, we just got started.
[time=577] But you're young, Bill.
[time=579] You got a long time to do that.
[time=581] The most, I guess I can use this word in the proper way and you'll understand it and our people understand it, the most famous song, the one that we knew about you first because of, which is very bad grammar.
[time=594] In fact, I taught grammar a long time ago.
[time=597] Is that right?
[time=598] Back in the Stone Age, I started teaching.
[time=600] Well, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said it that way.
[time=606] He touched me. Most groups have recorded it, most soloists sing it.
[time=613] We have had every group in the choir and soloists here sing it and it's a song that God has really used.
[time=618] How did that come about?
[time=620] Dr. Dale Oldham, many of you know him, has been a dear friend of our family for a long time and you may even know his son Doug better.
[time=630] Back in the early 60s, when the Gloria and I first started writing, Doug just came to know the Lord.
[time=635] Dr. Oldham was speaking in Huntington, not far from here, in a revival meeting and asked Doug to sing and Doug needed somebody to plunk along on the keys while he was singing.
[time=647] So I volunteered to go and we went up for the whole week every night.
[time=652] We'd ride back and forth in the car on Highway 9 and talk about the good things God had done for us one night in particular.
[time=659] We're talking about how Doug was so thrilled about how God really came into his heart in life and turned that whole thing around in his family.
[time=667] At that time, Laura had left him and it was a pretty bad situation.
[time=671] Without the miraculous intervening of the Lord, that family would not have been put back together.
[time=677] And in my situation, many times, God had intervened in our lives and what God had done for us.
[time=684] Dr. Oldham simply said, "You know, a phrase that has always been meaningful to me and especially in light of what we've talked about here tonight, Bill, is a phrase he touched me."
[time=695] He said, "I think it says more than just the phrase. He touched me. I think it means a lot more to people."
[time=702] He said, "You ought to write a song called 'He Touch Me.'" And so I took the idea home. We have a little gym book that we keep ideas in and I wrote the idea down.
[time=710] And then the following Sunday morning, before we were beginning to go to church, I was playing around the piano and started playing around the little melody.
[time=717] And the Lord gave me that melody and the lyric.
[time=720] And I finished some songs that have taken a long time to write, like six or seven months we've written on some songs.
[time=726] That one took about, I think, an hour or so.
[time=729] And when I finished it, I said, "Hey, honey, to my wife, come in here and listen to this." And when Gloria heard it, I said, "What do you think?" And she said, "That's not bad." But she wasn't especially moved by it.
[time=746] But it's interesting what God does when He takes something that we create.
[time=750] I think the Lord just simply said, "I think I'll bless that song." And He sure is.
[time=756] We want to listen to it, a star narwhal that's going to sing for a star.
[time=767] [MUSIC]
[time=777] [singing]
[time=817] [singing] [singing] [singing]
[time=847] [singing]
[time=932] We're so very grateful that you've joined us on the Bible Hour today, and I know that you've been appreciating already the Ministry of Bill Gaither, who's sharing with us in today's service and the Ministry of Music from our choir and musicians.
[time=944] I'm grateful for the privilege of sharing this time with my wife Donna, as we talk to you at home about the Bible Hour and its ministry to your life and to your family.
[time=953] We have been sharing with our friends at home a very special little booklet that we're very excited about because it is a booklet of Scripture.
[time=960] It is a booklet called "The Answer Book." We called it "The Answer Book" because it is a book full of answers.
[time=966] It has the answers to all of the things that you need to know about from the Word of God because it is the Word of God put together in topical form.
[time=974] In this little book, there is a listing of the subjects from the Scripture that will help you to know what God's Word has to say about your need.
[time=983] We'd like to send the answer book to you as our free gift to you because we're glad you're watching and we want to hear from you.
[time=989] And we'd like for you to write to us this week and request your free copy of the answer book.
[time=994] When you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, or you may call us at our toll free number, 1-800-453-9,000.
[time=1006] We'll give you that information again in a moment, but Donna has something she wants to share with you about Bible study help that we know is really going to be a help to you.
[time=1012] We have always felt here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church that a key to an individual's growth is his study with the Word of God.
[time=1021] And we have a tool which we would like to send to you to help you to have a daily program of study in God's Word, and it's called the Daily Walk.
[time=1030] And the Daily Walk is a day by day assignment so that you may read through the entire Scriptures in one year.
[time=1037] We would like to send you your free copy of the Daily Walk, and in order to get it, all you have to do is call us at our toll free number, 1-800-453-9,000.
[time=1048] Or again, our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46-815.
[time=1058] And we would be delighted to send you both of these helpful tools, the answer book and the Daily Walk, if you will just get in touch with us.
[time=1066] We're so very grateful that we've heard from many of you this summer.
[time=1070] Yesterday I saw the mail come into our office and I was overwhelmed by the volume of mail just for one day.
[time=1076] I don't know if that's because of the interest and the topics that we've been discussing or your particular involvement in being excited about the Bible Hour, but we thank you.
[time=1085] And we'd like to encourage you to keep on keeping on during these very strategic days.
[time=1089] We'll have some exciting announcements about the expansion of the Bible Hour, and it will be coming your way shortly in the mail.
[time=1095] I know you're going to be as excited about it as we are, and I hope you'll continue to pray that God's Word will go forward in a greatly expanding way through the Bible Hour television ministry.
[time=1105] We believe it's a unique ministry because it focuses in upon the Word of God and the issues that pertain to living the Christian life in today's world.
[time=1113] And that's our only purpose to glorify Jesus Christ through the teaching and preaching of His Word and the honoring of His name through music.
[time=1121] We hope that you'll continue to pray with us and help us to make sure that the Bible Hour continues to be a strong and vibrant force in our society today.
[time=1129] If you can send a gift this week to help in the support of this ministry, it is greatly appreciated and very helpful.
[time=1136] During the summer months, sometimes the gift income goes down just a bit.
[time=1140] We have to struggle a little while until we get back into the routine of the fall, and so your help at this time would be greatly appreciated.
[time=1147] Maybe you've never written to us or sent a gift to help in the Bible Hour ministry before.
[time=1152] You'd like to make a first time gift to express your appreciation to the ministry for what it's meant in your own life.
[time=1158] We'd greatly appreciate hearing from you this week.
[time=1161] Before we go back to the service, I'm going to ask Donna to give you all that information again so that you can get in touch with us and let us know of the helps that you need and also to write to us and help us in the ministry God has given us to do.
[time=1175] Our toll-free number again is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=1181] You may call that number at any time during the week. It's not just during this particular hour of the day.
[time=1186] We'll have a Bible Hour operator there ready to receive your call and to forward the information to us.
[time=1192] On our mailing address, if you prefer to write, is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=1202] And we really would appreciate hearing from you this week.
[time=1205] Donna, we're going to be hearing from Bill Gather again in just a moment and some more music, and then a message from the Word of God on the subject.
[time=1212] Does prayer belong in the public schools?
[time=1214] I hope you'll listen, share with us for the remaining portion of this program.
[time=1222] We have been sharing together in the ministry of Bill Gather, and we're so grateful that he took time out of his busy schedule to come and be with us.
[time=1229] Bill, we want to talk a little bit about a song that our Black Hawk singers are going to sing in a few moments.
[time=1235] Long before that was ever officially recorded, I came down to Alexandria and sat in the back room in your operation and listened to some rough tracks and tried to read the music, which I don't do very well, and I was captured by the words of that song.
[time=1249] Tell us how it happened.
[time=1252] You know Dave, a lot of our songs have been born out of experiences with our children.
[time=1258] Suzanne is our oldest, she's 15 now, and I'm very proud of her.
[time=1262] Suzanne's 15, Amy, is 11, Vigies, 10, or, in fact, proud of all three of them.
[time=1267] But when Suzanne was just a baby, she loved her pacifier.
[time=1272] In fact, she called it her pass for short. She'd get in trouble or something with us, and she'd say, "Give me my pass."
[time=1280] She'd take it and stick it in her mouth and go in a corner somewhere, and all was well. She had her pass.
[time=1287] She didn't know there was a Vietnam war going on at the time or international tensions or racial problems. She had her pass.
[time=1294] Well, this went off for some time until Gloria and I started talking. We thought it might be wise to at least start thinking about taking that pass away from her.
[time=1303] Because we knew one of these days she'd want to go to college, and we really didn't know how long it was going to go on.
[time=1317] So at any rate, you know, we tried several times. Finally, she said, "Suzanne, you've got to get along without a pass fire."
[time=1324] And so we took him. We thought we had trouble before. We really had trouble after that.
[time=1328] All kind of emotional problems started stuttering, and it was just a mess.
[time=1335] So at any rate, we talked to our pastor about it and prayed about it, and read Dr. Spock.
[time=1343] That was before he went to jail. And also before Dr. Dobson and some of the other folks came along, and we were just getting help anywhere we could get help.
[time=1355] And thought, "Well, I was going to call that much emotional reaction. Give it back to her and let nature take its course."
[time=1361] And so that went on. Until one day, all on her own, she came in with this passifier hanging on the end of her finger.
[time=1367] Came up to Gloria, she said, "Here, Mommy, take this thing." She said, "It's empty."
[time=1378] And I thought since then how many times we've all done that. We've gone for substitutes because a real thing wasn't available or searching for answers and all different kinds of places.
[time=1394] And we all have to sooner or later go to the Heavenly Father and say, "Father, take this. It's empty. Nothing anymore."
[time=1405] And we came to the place where we thought, you know, just to come to the Lord and say, "What this or what that or this gift or that gift just really seems crazy when he is the giver of all good things anyway."
[time=1422] And we just wanted to come to Him and say, "Lord, just give me you." Because I don't know if you're like me, but the world can crowd in from all sides and sometimes even good things.
[time=1433] It's easy to make a choice between good and bad, but sometimes the choice between good and better is rather difficult.
[time=1438] And it can crowd in on us.
[time=1443] And we just felt like going to the Heavenly Father and saying, "Father, we're not seeking in a gift or an emotional lift or anything."
[time=1451] And we just want you. I think the pastor put it better than I did, the first service when he said, "Seek the giver rather than the gift."
[time=1460] So we wrote this song, "More of You. More of You. I've had all but what I really need is just more of You."
[time=1467] Amen. Amen. Let's listen to the music of that now, shall we?
[time=1481] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
[time=1605] I'm not trying to find just a new frame of mind that will change my old point of view.
[time=1618] But I've been through it all deep inside that exchange I'm not new.
[time=1627] I'm not new, I'm not seeking a gift or a emotional lift, but when things are longing to do.
[time=1644] Just lift up my cup and let you fill it up with just you.
[time=1655] More of You.
[time=1664] More of You. I've had all but what I really need just more of You.
[time=1679] Just more of You of things I've had my fill and yet I hunger still.
[time=1694] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=1748] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers. That's a great song.
[time=1753] It's really neat, isn't it, to be able to share how it was written and then hear it sung and let it minister to our hearts?
[time=1762] Ten weeks ago, I began a series of messages built around the theme, the biblical issues that face America in election year 1980.
[time=1774] I thought you'd be interested to know how that series of messages was conceived in my own heart.
[time=1780] I was invited several months ago to attend a rally sponsored by an organization that was dealing with the subject of morality and the Christian's response to it.
[time=1792] And I went to that large rally in the state of Indianapolis and I heard and saw all of these things that were being said, some of them politically, a few of them biblically.
[time=1802] And I came home and my wife asked me what I thought.
[time=1807] And I responded as honestly as I could. I said, "Honey, I almost wish I hadn't gone because my head was already filled with too much to have to think out.
[time=1818] And now I've got this whole thing to think through and I really don't know what I think.
[time=1822] But obviously I've got to decide where do we fit? Where do I fit in all of this?"
[time=1828] For you see, I was deeply troubled by some of the extremes that seemed to be cropping up within the greater evangelical movement.
[time=1839] Over here on this side in one realm are people who seem to be saying a great deal of sort of in biblical language, but much of it is very political.
[time=1852] And I'd ask myself this question, "Do I have a right and a responsibility as a man of God to get involved in saying political things?"
[time=1862] On the other hand, over here, many of my brethren in the ministry, preachers of the Word of God were saying, "We don't have a right to say anything.
[time=1870] We need to just keep quiet and let the world go quietly by, and ultimately people will make up their own minds.
[time=1876] But as men of God, we teach the Word of God and we don't have any right to say anything about these issues.
[time=1882] Just keep quiet and stay at the business of preaching the Word of God."
[time=1888] So these two things were conflicting in my own mind.
[time=1893] And finally one day as I was praying about this, I began to realize that many of the things that were being politicized were really issues about which God had clearly spoken.
[time=1904] And that as a man of God, and as a preacher of the Word of God, I not only had a right but a responsibility to say, "Thus sayeth the Lord."
[time=1915] And so I began to listen to what I was hearing and the controversies that were waging around us.
[time=1920] And I realized that there were a lot of things that were happening to us in the Christian community, a lot of inputs that were being made into our lives that were coming about because we didn't know for sure where we stood on some of these things.
[time=1931] And I heard Christians saying, "Well, I don't think it really matters.
[time=1934] I mean, after all, doesn't God allow homosexuality in his economy?
[time=1940] Some people are just different than others and wouldn't God allow that?" And how can we be so sure that abortion is a problem that Christians have to wrestle with?
[time=1948] Isn't that all right under certain circumstances and et cetera?
[time=1951] So I went back to the Word of God and began to dig into those issues.
[time=1954] And I want to tell you that I don't know what it's meant to the rest of you, but it's been a tremendously helpful summer for me to sharpen my focus on the fact that in much of this that we wrestle with in our world today, God has spoken.
[time=1966] And he has said it clearly so we can understand what it is we're supposed to do.
[time=1971] I don't care whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.
[time=1974] The issue isn't who is the person or whether you like his looks or what he says the issue is where does he line up on the things about which God has spoken.
[time=1982] There's where you make your decision.
[time=1985] And I've asked God to help me not stray in either direction, either to be a part of the silent majority or to become a political right wing flag waiver.
[time=1994] It may surprise you, but I have absolutely no position on the Panama Canal.
[time=2000] Because I haven't found a word from God on that issue.
[time=2003] I have looked, but I haven't found it.
[time=2008] There are many other things that we hear being discussed today about which I have nothing to say.
[time=2013] I have my own personal convictions and sometimes at a week moment I may share them with you, but I can't say, "Thus saith the Lord."
[time=2022] We come today to the last of those ten messages and we're sort of coming out of the whole situation at the same place where we entered.
[time=2030] For the first message that I gave ten weeks ago had to do with the subject of is the church separate from the state.
[time=2038] Today we're talking about the topic.
[time=2041] Does prayer belong in the public school?
[time=2046] And if you think very carefully about those two things you will see how tangent they are to each other.
[time=2053] May I say to you at the outset that there isn't any chapter in the Bible that I have found where God says, "Thus saith the Lord."
[time=2063] As it relates to prayer in the public schools.
[time=2066] There are some general principles that we can apply.
[time=2070] But I personally believe there is more confusion about this issue among Christians that I know and love and fellowship with than perhaps any of the other issues.
[time=2081] And so, though I am going to say something from the Word of God today, my major purpose in this time together this morning is to try to, if I can, straighten out some of the confusion that is raging about the subject of prayer in the public schools.
[time=2096] For you see, on occasion Christians have spoken without doing their homework and we have lost credibility in the arena where we are seeking to have a voice.
[time=2111] Not too long ago there were letters and petitions raging all across the country about a so-called FCC plot to get religious and radio and television off the air.
[time=2125] Preachers all over the land, fundamentalist preachers had people send floods of letters to the government decrying this terrible intrusion into the church.
[time=2136] Millions of letters were sent to the FCC so much so that they had to hire an entire staff just to take care of the mail.
[time=2143] It was all predicated upon a supposed situation that triggered this and when the research was done there never was such a situation.
[time=2154] There never was a threat. There never was anything that should have caused that but someone misunderstood something and started the ball rolling and Christians jumped on the bandwagon and started writing letters like crazy
[time=2165] until finally they had to go on a major campaign to shut it down so they could understand that there never was an issue.
[time=2172] Now you say well at least they found out we're out here. That's true. They did. They found out in great force that we're out here. They know we're here.
[time=2180] But you see folks the problem with that is the next time there is a real issue and we have to address it our letters don't mean quite as much because we have lost credibility with the people we're trying to impress and make an impact on.
[time=2197] This whole matter of the prayer in public schools has been greatly exaggerated on one hand and tremendously underestimated on the other.
[time=2211] It all began as far as I can understand officially back in 1962 and 63 in the Ingle and Shemp decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
[time=2223] Those decisions ruled that state required prayer and Bible reading in the public schools were unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment.
[time=2232] The Ingle case involved a 22 word prayer recited by the public school students in the state of New York at the beginning of each school day.
[time=2244] The Shemp case dealt with the Pennsylvania practice of reading ten Bible verses every morning over the school intercon system followed by a recitation of the Lord's Prayer.
[time=2255] As a result of these two decisions on June 17, 1963 before a national television audience Madeline Muriel Hare declared victory for the cause of humanistic atheism.
[time=2269] Because she felt that by eradicating the last vestiges of Christian influence from the state schools, children could now be indoctrinated in the religion of humanism.
[time=2282] Well, I'm sure you know what happened as the result of that decision.
[time=2287] The Gallup poll in September of 1963 showed that the American people opposed those two decisions by a three to one majority.
[time=2295] Since that time over a hundred different amendments to the Constitution have been proposed to try to get that back into the Constitution as a possibility for Christians in the school system.
[time=2310] The problem with this whole situation among Christians today is the fact that in dealing with this issue we have really not understood what exactly we were fighting against.
[time=2327] I believe that the greatest safeguard to my religious freedom is the First Amendment to the Constitution. I believe in that First Amendment. I think it's good. I don't oppose it.
[time=2339] I believe wholeheartedly in the separation of the church and state. That is a Baptist distinctive and it is a good principle.
[time=2346] But men and women I do not believe in the great illusion of that amendment which has been pushed upon the American people.
[time=2358] And when reduced to its least common denominator teaches the divorcement of God completely from all institutions, government, school, etc.
[time=2367] Just a story Clark who was responsible for the drafting of that amendment has been corroborated by others. In the words of James Madison the First Amendment religion clauses were prompted because the people feared that one sect might obtain a preeminence or that two different denominations might combine together and establish a religion to which they could compel others to conform.
[time=2391] The concern of Madison and the founding fathers of our country was that one Christian denomination might prevail over the others and all of those who had come here to this country had run away from that. They didn't want to be a part of the state as it related to the church.
[time=2407] Thus the First Amendment was not meant to prevent the establishment of Christianity as a religion but it was meant to prevent a single Christian denomination from dominating all the rest.
[time=2426] The framers of that particular amendment had no intention of eradicating traditional theism by the First Amendment because to them and if you study history you'll see this clearly to those men religion entailed a relationship of man to a supreme being
[time=2442] and history is replete with the close connections between the public institutions of this country and the religious policies of traditional Christian theism.
[time=2454] The predominantly Christian orientation of the American people mitigates against the absolute separation of church and state.
[time=2463] It is these facts that the framers had in mind when they drafted the First Amendment.
[time=2469] It was true that they wished to secure religious freedom of all men but it never was their desire to create a secular humanist nation with God uninvolved in her affairs.
[time=2482] Now it has historically been the strategy of Satan to take that which is good and pervert it to the place where it is bad.
[time=2493] He started that whole procedure back in the Garden of Eden and he has never stopped. It is one of his most insidious strategies.
[time=2501] And if you listen carefully to the debate that's going on in today's world relative to this subject that we're dealing with today you will discover that the problem is we're debating an issue without really understanding what the issue is.
[time=2514] We're talking about an issue which the secular humanists have elevated to a level far above that which the Constitution is talking about and we're fighting against a straw man.
[time=2530] Not too long ago Philip Crane who is in my estimation one of the finest men that we have in the political arena today made some very important comments about this First Amendment as it relates to the subject of prayer and I think he helped us to see it somewhat in perspective.
[time=2549] He said and I quote the First Amendment to the Constitution says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[time=2561] Based on this language the Supreme Court in 1962 ruled that voluntary prayers in public schools were illegal.
[time=2570] In other words the Supreme Court in 1962 interpreted the First Amendment to prohibit any state from doing anything touching upon religion.
[time=2580] This interpretation conflicts with the history of the constitutional convention itself.
[time=2587] The convention did not intend to abridge the authority of the states to set their own policy with respect to religious and moral questions.
[time=2596] During the convention the New Hampshire delegation proposed that the First Amendment read "Congress shall make no laws touching religion" and it was summarily voted down because that was not their purpose.
[time=2609] They put in the words establishment of religion because they realized that in any union where the state has no touch upon religion you have developed a totally secular union and the constitutional Congress did not want that.
[time=2625] In fact the record leaves no doubt when the First Amendment was approved by Congress in 1789, listen to this, five states had established religions.
[time=2637] Other states had already refused to establish state religions.
[time=2642] A major purpose of the amendment as James Madison wrote it was this, to assure that the federal government had no power to disturb these local decisions.
[time=2654] So the broader issue that's at stake here is not even the matter of prayer in the public schools, it's a matter of the federal bureaucracy trying to dictate policy across the wide spans of the United States and leaving absolutely no decisions to the local and state governments.
[time=2671] That was never the intention of that amendment when it was framed.
[time=2678] So Christian parents today are left in a quandary about secularism in the public schools.
[time=2686] For many of them the Supreme Court decisions of 62 and 63 banning government sponsored prayer and devotional Bible reading in the schools were the last straw.
[time=2696] They decided when that happened to enroll their children in private Christian schools others lobbied for bills that permit students and teachers to pray or meditate in public schools and the battle has continued to wage until this very hour.
[time=2709] In recent months the prayer in schools issues has resurfaced in several states for instance in Buffalo New York.
[time=2716] Students were denied the use of public schools for voluntary prayer sessions and Bible clubs.
[time=2721] Similarly students at Gillerland High School in Albany were refused permission to gather voluntarily for prayer on school property outside of the school hours.
[time=2732] The New Jersey Board of Education ordered a high school principal to quit holding prayer meetings for students in his office.
[time=2739] In Massachusetts Kentucky and Oklahoma legislature's school prayer bills have been hotly debated.
[time=2745] How should a Christian view this issue today?
[time=2750] Well first of all I think we really need to understand what the Supreme Court decision means. Listen carefully.
[time=2757] The court seems to be saying that the government may not sponsor religious exercises in the public schools but it may permit them under certain circumstances.
[time=2769] Number one as long as the end result does not favor one religion over another and number two as long as participation in the religious exercise is completely voluntary.
[time=2781] If there are public educators listening to me today let me tell you that if I understand what the constitutional amendment means and what the courts have adopted it to mean and interpreted it to mean you do have the right to have voluntary prayer in your school.
[time=2797] And we have been sold a bill of goods that says that's not legal.
[time=2804] In Massachusetts for instance in 1966 law prescribing a period of silence for meditation or prayer in public schools was upheld ten years later because it allegedly protected the rights of both students who wished to pray and those who did not wish to pray.
[time=2819] But a law passed in that state last year which took effect this February allowed classroom prayers only if students would lead them and that law was struck down by the state supreme judicial court so the battle continues to be very confusing.
[time=2835] It forced students and teachers who did not wish to pray to choose either to leave the room or to participate in a religious practice that made them feel uncomfortable.
[time=2845] In other words the law favored those who wanted to pray over those who did not want to do so.
[time=2851] I read recently in an article by CR Daily the editor of the western recorder these words.
[time=2857] He's a Kentucky Baptist and he wrote imagine the atmosphere of most of today's classrooms when the prayer period is announced and a volunteer leader is invited to take over.
[time=2869] Now the teacher excuses the non-prayers and the unsupervised non-prayers madly rush for the corridors in the restrooms.
[time=2881] Disorder and the lack of discipline are problems enough already for teachers without encouragement in the name of voluntary worship.
[time=2887] A prayer meeting in such an atmosphere is more sacrilege than worship.
[time=2892] Or imagine a Muslim student volunteering to lead the prayer one day and teaching fellow students how to bow toward Mecca and leading them in a prayer to Allah.
[time=2905] The kind of religious service this legislation calls for could not justly deny a Muslim, a Hindu, a Buddhist or any other pagan from leading the prayer.
[time=2915] Is that what we want in our schools?
[time=2918] So when you're out there waving the flag for prayer in the schools just remember what you're fighting for.
[time=2923] You're saying that the school then can be an open forum for every cult and ism and wasm to get up and promulgate their doctrine.
[time=2934] You see I believe that is quite right and proper and good and necessary in our schools for there to be a period of silence when students can pray.
[time=2946] And I think that's right and good and we ought to be able to do that and as far as I can understand the legislature we have the right to do that in our schools.
[time=2955] But I'm sure not going to go waving the flag for everybody in his uncle to come in that thing and pray their doctrine in front of all the children because I don't think that's what we want.
[time=2963] So just be careful what you're fighting for.
[time=2968] You see the other alternative which so many people have opted for in our world today is just to say well the best thing is to just throw it all out, have absolutely no religious emphasis at all in the school.
[time=2980] And sometimes I think we feel that by doing that that's safe but that's not safe because you see when we do that then we if so fact to support the religion of secular humanism which is the religion without God.
[time=2997] Listen to what Paul Blanchard an author and leading secular humanist gives as an indication of such thinking.
[time=3005] In an article entitled three cheers for our secular state he wrote, "Our 75 years in this country all of which I have lived and relished have been a good 75 years full of rebellion against religious superstition inspired by developing science and increasingly open to religious realism.
[time=3023] I doubt that any span in human history has carried the world farther along the road to honest doubt.
[time=3029] Mr. Blanchard states that his hero in this movement is the United States Supreme Court because of its decisions removing various Christian practices from the classroom.
[time=3038] He then tells us why America has moved so far down the path of secularism now listen carefully to what he wrote.
[time=3045] I think that the most important factor moving us toward a secular society has been the educational factor.
[time=3053] Our schools may not teach Johnny how to read but the fact that Johnny is in school until he is 16 tends to lead toward the elimination of religious superstition.
[time=3064] The average American child now acquires a high school education and this militates against the Adam and Eve and myths of alleged history.
[time=3073] When I was one of the editors of the nation he wrote back in the 20s I wrote an editorial explaining that golf and intelligence were the two primary reasons that men did not attend church, golf and intelligence.
[time=3088] Perhaps I would say that golf in a high school diploma now keep most people from going to church.
[time=3095] Basically what Paul Blanchard is saying is that public education in the way that he views it is a total destruction of Christianity.
[time=3104] In fact he seems to imply that such a goal should be the purpose of education.
[time=3108] That if we can educate our children in such a way that God is out here and he's not involved and we can teach them that life is life without God.
[time=3117] That somehow we can grow up a secular humanist society all around us.
[time=3123] Similar thinking can be seen in the writings of a man by the name of G. Richard Bozarth who has said it more blasphemeously.
[time=3131] In the American atheist he wrote we atheists today must admit that for corpses old Yahweh and J.C. superstar are taking a long time to stop twitching and grow old.
[time=3144] In speaking of ways in which to kill God Mr. Bozarth says and how does a God die?
[time=3151] Quite simply because all his religionists have been converted to another religion and there is no one left to make children believe that they need him.
[time=3161] We need only ensure that our schools teach only secular knowledge if we could achieve this God would indeed be shortly due for a funeral service.
[time=3173] You say Pastor Jeremiah what in the world is the answer? Where does a Christian line up?
[time=3183] On the radical fringe area out here waving a flag not for sure knowing why we're doing it?
[time=3191] Or a part of the silent majority not saying anything and just let the sweeping tide of humanism wash us away?
[time=3200] Well I want to say something this morning that may surprise you and that is I think the first thing we need to understand folks is that a part of this whole mentality about the school issue is a subtle transfer of responsibility from the home to an institution as it relates to Christian education.
[time=3224] Most of the people that I know who are getting so revved up about prayer in the public schools if they just use half as much energy to educate their children while they're at home that wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem.
[time=3237] Back in the book of Deuteronomy God gave to Moses the plan for Christian education he told parents in chapter six of that book that they were responsible to inculcate Christianity in the lives of their children.
[time=3250] And that insofar as was possible it was the father's responsibility and the mother's responsibility to teach those children the things of God and to cause them to grow up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
[time=3263] So number one is we relate to this problem let us not make the subtle move that comes so often with this issue in saying if we don't get the school straightened out all is lost that's not true.
[time=3277] If we get our homes straightened out we can do a great deal to help in the problem of educating our children.
[time=3288] Secondly I think we need to understand that every school is a separate entity in itself though we talk often of the school system.
[time=3296] We oftentimes indict all schools at one time without making separate analogy and investigation of each system. Frankly I've been in a number of schools in this whole area there as different as black is from white there as different as night is from day.
[time=3310] Some schools are good and positive it tends to be more true in the rural areas there are good influential schools in that area where children can grow up and not have their Christian beliefs torn from them.
[time=3325] There are also some schools even some that have religious heritages where I wouldn't send my child there if it was the only place in the world they could learn the ABCs.
[time=3338] Now there's a third thing I want to say and that is we have an answer.
[time=3346] We have an answer that I'm so excited about and I don't know how to explain it to you and that is I believe God has given to us a vehicle that will help us in this generation to steer a straight course through all of this confusion and that vehicle is the Christian school movement.
[time=3361] I am so grateful to God that we don't fight the battle of whether we can pray in our classrooms and when I walk by the doors of our school and the doors are open and the teachers are in there talking to their children quite often I stop for a moment
[time=3375] and I hear Christian teachers praying at the beginning of the classroom day with their students and praying for the students individually asking God to help them learn the things that will be taught.
[time=3386] And later on during the day I walk by the door and I see a teacher there with a student who maybe has been in trouble and they're talking through this thing after some discipline has been administered and they're praying together and trying to get it straight.
[time=3398] And when they teach literature and when they teach history they teach it with God at the center so that the students understand that it's not just secular knowledge but it is all truth with God integrated into every part of every subject.
[time=3413] And I say to you who have decided that your answer is in the public sector if you can do that at home if you can figure out a way to make that happen at home that's great and I know some families that have done it and I commend them for it.
[time=3428] But if you can't and if it bothers you and if you feel like it may be getting away from you and if you're concerned about the direction of your children in terms of all of the knowledge that they're amassing during these days then I ask you
[time=3442] to consider the opportunity that God has given you in a Christian school where people can pray and the government can't do anything about it.
