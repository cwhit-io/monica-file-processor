[time=0] (bell ringing) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=23] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=30] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=61] - And thank you for the good singing, you may be seated.
[time=64] - And we welcome you to this our morning service.
[time=70] It is the second morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, which we not only share together here in the auditorium, but we share with our many friends at home.
[time=80] And we're so grateful to all of you who have joined us now by television.
[time=83] It is our prayer that God will enrich your lives and encourage your hearts because this service has come into your life today.
[time=91] In a few moments, we'll be opening the Word of God to the third chapter of the Book of John.
[time=96] And if you follow in your Bibles there at home, here in the auditorium, you may wish to put a place, put something in that place so you'll be ready to join us as we study the Scripture.
[time=105] Right now, we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir and the direction of Mr. Don Kruger as they sing for us the song entitled, "O Glorious Love." (gentle music)
[time=145] (singing in foreign language)
[time=175] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=271] Thank you, choir. Just a few days ago,
[time=278] the entire staff of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and Christian school met together down near Toledo for our annual staff retreat.
[time=286] It was a great time of fellowship and blessing as we shared together the Word of God and fellowship with each other.
[time=293] One of the highlights of the retreat was the special music that was shared and provided for us by Alan Lenna Peterson.
[time=300] Lenna is the secretary to the principal of the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=305] They are new members of our church recently moved here from Grand Rapids and God has given them a rich ministry in music.
[time=311] I've asked Don to have them share with us in this service today and I know their ministry in music will bless your heart.
[time=318] The Peterson's.
[time=342] [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=466] [MUSIC] I know that you care [MUSIC] You're people, you're a prayer [MUSIC] What I pray for you [MUSIC] And I know that you are still there [MUSIC] You're still there â™ª
[time=514] We're so happy that you're with us in the Bible, our television program today,
[time=522] and I'm happy that my wife Donna is here to share with me as we talk together about the ministry that extends beyond the television hour right into your own home. Donna, we have been talking in recent days about a very special little booklet that well people from all over this area have been writing for and calling for. It's got a simple name, it's called the answer book.
[time=542] Now why in the world would we call a book the answer book? Because it is just that, it's God's
[time=548] answer to the problems that we face in our everyday Christian lives and it covers such topics as
[time=555] spiritual growth, peace of mind. One that I particularly like these days is patience after
[time=562] being home all summer with four young children. It's kind of neat to know that God has something
[time=568] to say about having patience in our lives. I've noticed that the page in your answer book under the subject of patience is well-worn and so you must be turning to it often. These topics
[time=579] are very helpful because it makes it possible for you to take a very concise little compendium of
[time=585] scriptures and quickly turn to the important passages of scripture without leafing through all of the Bible trying to find them. Now if your Bible is like mine, it probably has some verses underlined, maybe shaded in red or blue and I've marked my Bibles ever since I can remember
[time=601] reading them but it's not always easy to find all those marked passages when you want them on the spur of the moment and the answer book does that job for you. Now the answer book not only has all of the pages with the topics and the verses printed underneath them but at the back of the book there is a further listing of scriptures with just the reference so if you don't find what
[time=622] you want printed out on the page you can turn to the back of the book and there you will discover a listing of all of the passages that deal with these subjects. Some of you may want to use this
[time=633] in your counseling ministry and helping others. Some of you may want to use it to be counseled yourselves but the thing that's exciting about it is that it is such a useful tool. Donnie it's not
[time=643] a big book. It's an easy to carry book isn't it? Yes it's very convenient to carry it in your
[time=649] purse or in the back of your Bible and just have it handy when you need it and we would like to send you your free copy of the answer book and to receive your copy all you need to do is call us
[time=659] at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000. Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would
[time=668] like to have your free copy of the answer book or if you prefer you may write to us and our mailing
[time=674] address is pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and if you'll just
[time=684] pick up your phone and call us now or drop us a note sometime this week we'll be happy to send you your free copy of the answer book. Donnie before we stop talking about the answer book today let me remind our friends at home that for you men especially I found that the answer book fits
[time=700] conveniently in the inside pocket of your suit jacket and I carry mine there quite often find it very helpful just on a spur of the moment to open it up during the day and share a couple of passages of scripture that can be an encouragement to my own heart and perhaps an encouragement to others that we're trying to help along with the answer book we have an exciting program of Bible study that we feel just fits right in with the Bible hour and its purpose and we'd like to share
[time=725] that with you now this Bible study program is a program called the daily walk and it is just that
[time=732] it makes it possible for you to walk with the Lord in his word on a daily basis now the daily walk is
[time=738] a program that gets you through the word of God in in a year's time making it possible for you to read every word of the entire Bible in the 365 days of a year Donna the program comes in a monthly
[time=750] packet that's well just so very helpful yes it certainly is and I have a letter that I'd like to
[time=756] share that we received this week about the daily walk which was a real encouragement to us this individual writes I recently had the chance to read your daily walk in a laundry mat now that's
[time=767] a first I would be very interested in receiving your Bible study magazine my husband and I are
[time=774] fairly young Christians the daily walk is such an excellent Bible study thanks so much and that
[time=781] came to us from West Lafayette Donna once in a while I get an opportunity to see the envelopes that come back from the daily walk program they're returned each month with all of the assignments checked this week I saw those envelopes coming back into our office and I was just overwhelmed at the number of people who are reading through the scriptures with us and so it encompasses it encompasses a great number of folks all over this part of the country who are studying the scripture day by day and there's a unique kind of fellowship that goes along with that obviously we come to you one hour a week on television and yet we are together in the word of God each day
[time=817] if you're following the daily walk program we're all of us reading the same scriptures every day and fellowshipping together in the word of God and kind of an invisible fellowship that well as
[time=828] unique to the Christian experience and we'd very much like to have you involved in reading through the Bible with us we'd like to encourage you to call us or write to us this week and let us know
[time=838] of your desire to study the word of God along with all of us in the daily walk program now let me

[time=922] Fort Wayne Indiana we're looking forward to hearing from you this week we counted a real privilege to minister to you through the Bible hour television program Dave Miller is coming now and he's going
[time=934] to tell us no one ever cared for me like Jesus I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found in him a friend so kind and true
[time=962] I would tell you how he changed my life completely he did something that no other friend would do
[time=974] though one ever cared for me
[time=987] like Jesus there's no other friend so kind as he
[time=1003] no one else could take the sin and darkness from me
[time=1017] oh how much he care for me
[time=1030] every day he comes to me with new assurance more and more I understand his words of love
[time=1048] but I'll never know just why he came to save me till some day I see his blessed face
[time=1066] no one ever cared for me like Jesus
[time=1078] there's no other friend so kind as he
[time=1094] no one else could take the sin and darkness from me
[time=1103] oh how much he care for me
[time=1131] thank you David I was just thinking as he was singing how wonderful it is to be cared for
[time=1153] and how great it is to know that the god of the universe cares about me and he cares about you
[time=1159] just before the message this morning we're going to listen to the musical group that
[time=1165] we so appreciate here and hardly ever meet people who watch the bible hour who don't say
[time=1171] something about the blessing of the black hawk singers to them and they're a blessing to us too I trust that your heart will be open to the spirit of God's ministry as they sing for us now
[time=1184] [MUSIC]
[time=1213] I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus and as a reed and wonder how he could love me
[time=1233] the silver condemned and clean how marvelous how wonderful and my song shall ever be
[time=1250] how marvelous how wonderful is my Savior's love for me
[time=1263] he took my sins and my sorrows he made them his very own
[time=1280] he poured the burden to Calvary and suffered and died alone
[time=1310] bring with the ransom in glory
[time=1316] will be thy joy through the ages to sing on his love for me
[time=1335] how marvelous how wonderful and my song shall ever be
[time=1347] how marvelous how wonderful is my Savior's love
[time=1360] my Savior's love for me
[time=1368] I don't think it hurt us to say amen around here once in a while
[time=1381] amen amen thank you just a moment I want to ask some past black hawk staff members to stand and
[time=1389] I want to let the folks upstairs know where they are so they can get them on camera we're so happy when folks come back here to visit with us and they're long friends then we meet them on occasion
[time=1401] I just was at the pastor's conference in Cedarville and the featured speaker for the women was Carol Kent who was on our staff here as the director of the women alive ministries and they're back visiting with us today I'd like for you all to see that they're here Jean and Carol we stand up folks so that we can let everyone know you're here thank you for visiting with us and you'll all want to greet them at the end of the service now I hope you brought your bibles that's the tool
[time=1425] that you need to really have a part in what goes on at the black hawk Baptist church it doesn't have to be any kind of a special one just one that's got God's word written in it and I want you to take
[time=1436] your bibles and turn with me to one of the most famous and familiar chapters in all of the word of God the third chapter of the gospel of John John chapter three and I'm reading from the third
[time=1448] chapter of John verses one through 13 so if you have your bibles and you have them open it will
[time=1454] help you if you follow along in your Bible silently as I read from mine audibly and it will impress the truth of this portion of scripture upon your heart John chapter three verse one there was a man
[time=1467] of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and he sent
[time=1473] it to him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and sent it to him verily verily I say unto thee
[time=1484] except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born
[time=1495] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit marble not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind
[time=1511] bloweth where it willeth and thou hearest the sound of it but can't not tell from where it cometh and where it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit Nicodemus answered and sent
[time=1521] it to him how can these things be Jesus answered and sent it to him art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that which we do know
[time=1532] and testify to that which we have seen and you receive not our witness now if I've told you
[time=1538] earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things and no man
[time=1544] hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man who is in heaven
[time=1550] shall we pray father we are so grateful for this passage of scripture it speaks to us in the
[time=1556] maelu of spiritual jargon that floats around our heads these days it helps us to get back to an
[time=1563] understanding that God would give to the meaning of words which are used so very flippantly by
[time=1569] people in almost every segment of our society and we would simply ask that you would give to us the
[time=1575] meaning to these words that God has in his heart help us to faithfully interpret and apply these
[time=1581] truths to our own hearts and may the body of understanding which we gain this morning Lord be a set of truths which we can apply to our own lives and we shall be praying that you
[time=1592] will help us to know how this truth can become a part of our lives in these days ahead and for
[time=1598] those who may be in doubt as to the meaning of this whole matter of spiritual life we pray that in
[time=1604] a very special way you will grant to them an understanding and an intensity of hearing today
[time=1610] that would make it possible for God's word to enter into their heart and his life into their soul but we pray in Jesus name and for his sake amen. Some time ago I was speaking down south and a
[time=1622] friend of mine came up to me and he said do you know what a bean bone is and I said what he said
[time=1628] do you know what a bean bone is I said no sir I have to be honest I don't I've heard of soup bones and chicken bones and turkey bones and dog bones but what is a bean bone he said I'm not exactly sure what it is but down here wherever I go with religious people all they ever talk about is the fact that they've been bone again and when I heard that I was reminded of how that term has
[time=1649] become used in almost every segment of society I picked up the Newsweek magazine a few months ago
[time=1656] as did most of you at least on the front pages of your paper you saw these terms and I saw on the
[time=1662] front page this term Jimmy Carter has been born again now I knew that Jimmy Carter claimed to be a
[time=1670] born-again Christian so I knew it could not be a reference to his spiritual birth as I opened the pages of the magazine I understood that the editors of the magazine had transferred some terms
[time=1681] from the spiritual realm to the political realm they were not talking about his spiritual rebirth they were talking about his political rebirth through the events of Camp David which brought about the treaty in the Middle East they were saying that Jimmy Carter's political career had
[time=1696] been born again I had an unholy thought this week as I was thinking of this message that if you could
[time=1702] transfer religious jargon into the political realm Jimmy Carter would have to be a political Armenian for he needs to be born again and again and again and again I don't believe that he is that
[time=1715] I believe that he understands the meaning of the term spiritually and I certainly do not make light
[time=1721] of our leader but I do say that we're living in a time when the language that once uniquely
[time=1727] belonged to Christians has been cast about in the waters of uncertainty so that people are gradually coming away from conferences and encounters not knowing for sure what it is exactly we're talking
[time=1739] about everyone is using the term born again books are being written about it magazine articles are
[time=1748] featuring it everyone seems to know the term but sad but true very few people comprehend what the
[time=1756] term means from time immemorial man has tried to do his very best to change the nature of things
[time=1764] about him there is a prayer which is attributed to an old time saint that goes like this all
[time=1770] that a man would arise in me that the man I am might cease to be whether we know it or not most
[time=1778] all of us have at one time prayed that prayer all that a man would arise in me that the man I am
[time=1785] might cease to be it is that in eight craving on the part of humanity to be better than they are and to somehow change their circumstances so that life will hold more meaning for them on the day
[time=1797] to day level if we look back at history we can see how different people have tried to make that
[time=1803] happen in their world as far back as Plato and the republic the ideal state there was the concept
[time=1810] that that the world could be ruled by philosophy if we could just understand the meanings of the
[time=1817] world we could rule our world by philosophy Thomas Moore constructed the concept of utopia and he
[time=1825] thought that right education would change the culture so that this meaning would come to man Francis Bacon in his new Atlantis thought that science in the conquest of nature would ultimately
[time=1836] bring meaning to our world and to this life even Hitler and his third Reich thought that racial
[time=1844] supremacy was the answer to the needs of men Carl Marx followed that up and he said no it's not
[time=1850] racial supremacy it is a classless society that will bring meaning and a real life to this world
[time=1858] in which we live the problem with all of these ideas which long ago have been proven to lack
[time=1864] the essence of meaning is that they are materialistic panacea's to a problem which is a spiritual
[time=1870] problem in the lives of men and women they are attempts on the part of man to look at his environment
[time=1876] and to somehow change man from the outside in I read this week that the problem with all kinds
[time=1882] of moral reformation plans is the problem one encounters when he tries to drain a swamp that
[time=1888] is fed by an underground stream no matter what you do if you don't deal with the source of the
[time=1894] problem you will never get the job done over and over again as we look about us in our world we see
[time=1900] modernistic theology and self-improvement programs that are trying to take man from where he is
[time=1906] and cause him to be elevated above that level and the only problem that they face is they are
[time=1912] powerless to do it until they deal with the source of the problem and only the spiritual
[time=1918] realities of God's word and the truth that is given to us even in this passage of scripture can ultimately and finally deal with that problem so that the prayer of the man who prayed oh that
[time=1929] there would arise in me a new man that I might cease to be the man I am only in terms of spiritual
[time=1936] realities can that prayer be answered I can say that there was a day in my life as an unsaved young
[time=1942] man that I prayed in my own words that prayer oh that there would arise in me a man so that the
[time=1948] man I am would cease to be and that man was the man Christ Jesus who was born into my life and I
[time=1954] understood for the first time the spiritual realities of the new birth there was a man by the name of
[time=1960] Nicodemus who came to Jesus one night a man who was a religious man the Bible says he was a Pharisee
[time=1967] as a Pharisee he carried with him the greatest credentials any religious man could carry he was
[time=1976] as a Pharisee loyal to the law looked upon as the protector of the Torah the loyalist to the law
[time=1983] he lived according to the very minute details and principles of the Jewish law in fact the
[time=1990] Pharisee called writings which have come down to us through history demonstrate that the Pharisees had an unbelievable ability to take the law and magnify it to its tenth power getting all of the
[time=2002] restrictions ten times more than the restrictions of the law as a Pharisee he was not only loyal to the law he was loyal to Jehovah he had within his heart a great spirit of reverence for Jehovah
[time=2014] God the Jehovah of the Old Testament he was the protector of the tradition of Judaism the Pharisees
[time=2022] felt that it was within their spectrum of responsibility to make sure that judyistic tradition was carried
[time=2028] on from one generation to the other he was the spiritual leader of his generation according to
[time=2035] John chapter three verse ten Jesus said that Nicodemus was a teacher of Israel he was a leader among
[time=2041] the leaders he was one who had risen to the very top of the religious aristocracy and he was looked
[time=2048] upon with respect by all who knew him not only was he a religionist but the scripture says he was a
[time=2054] teacher the word rabbi which he gives to the Lord Jesus is a word which means teacher and the scripture
[time=2061] says that Nicodemus himself was a teacher that gives to us some clue as to his confrontation
[time=2069] with Christ by night sometimes when we read this passage we get the impression that Nicodemus came
[time=2076] to seek out Jesus because he felt his own deep spiritual need for help there is no evidence of
[time=2082] that in the text the evidence of the text is that he was motivated by Jesus miracles to understand how
[time=2088] he did what he did verse two of this chapter says that he came to Jesus and said now what a teacher
[time=2094] come from God for nobody can do the things you do except you be from God one does not have to guess
[time=2101] very long to discern that what Nicodemus was saying is this here I am a teacher I have risen to the
[time=2108] very top of the teaching profession in Judaism and here you are an itinerant traveler a man out of
[time=2114] Galilee with no reputation whatsoever yet when you teach you perform miracles and people flock to
[time=2121] hear you and when I teach I don't get those results and so he was motivated to come to Jesus to find
[time=2128] out what his clue was what his secret was that had made him such a dynamic teacher it reminds me of
[time=2134] the fact that so many people usually come to Christ for the wrong reasons and then ultimately get
[time=2141] the real need in their life met I doubt if any of us could honestly say that we came to Jesus Christ motivated purely out of our spiritual need many times we come to Christ because of the problems that
[time=2152] come into our life we hear testimonies in the baptistry even last week of people who were brought to Jesus Christ out of a deep desire to have their problems met but aren't you glad that when we
[time=2163] come to Christ with our felt needs Jesus Christ looks beyond the needs we feel to the needs that are
[time=2170] real and he zeroes in on us where we need to be hit and so he did with Nicodemus Nicodemus came and he said I want to know how I can be a good teacher he came as a teacher to a
[time=2181] teacher to be taught Jesus Christ showed him in a short time that he needed to come as a sinner to
[time=2187] a savior to be saved there's a vast difference the thing that happened in this situation is very
[time=2194] interesting because he was so afraid of breaking with the tradition of his co-religionis that he was
[time=2200] not willing to meet Jesus in the light of day in fact there are only three references to Nicodemus and the New Testament all of them in john and every time he is mentioned he is always mentioned as the man who came to Jesus by night as if to remind everyone that he was afraid to really open
[time=2216] his heart to the needs he had and he didn't even want his peers to know that he had slipped into the presence of the master to find help I know that there are in occasions people who come to the
[time=2226] black hawk Baptist church in cognito slip into the back row afraid like crazy that anyone would ever know that they had come to such a fundamentalist bible teaching believing church but they come because they feel a need now the impact of this passage is found in the fact that even though these
[time=2243] words are familiar to us in these words which are found in the third chapter of john are four of
[time=2250] the most profound truths that you will ever find any place together in god's word they are
[time=2256] truths apart from which no man can enter into the presence of god either in this life or in the life to come these truths though they are simply stated are profound and go beyond the imagination
[time=2268] of any human being to construct or even to understand the first of these truths is this that in this
[time=2277] world in which we live there are two distinct spheres in which we live and move there is the sphere of the flesh and the sphere of the spirit the bible teaches us that there are two realms in
[time=2289] which man lives we are very familiar with the sphere of the flesh because it is that which is around us we can feel it touch it be a part of it but may I say to you today that the sphere of the spirit is just as real just as easily to discern in the lives of people as the sphere of the spirit
[time=2306] the only problem with us is that when we are born into this world in the flesh we are born
[time=2312] with our god word minds closed we are born spiritually dead the reason why men and women in our world
[time=2319] today don't understand spiritual things is because they don't have any way to perceive of the spiritual
[time=2325] world we perceive of the world of the flesh through our eyes and our ears through the sensations which we have but when a man is born into the world of the flesh he does not have the equipment by which he
[time=2336] can perceive of the spirit world but the bible says there are two realms in which we live there is the realm of the flesh and the realm of the spirit notice please what it says in the sixth verse that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit the interesting thing
[time=2352] about this truth is that these two realms are absolutely incapable of coexistence without a miracle from
[time=2360] god in the book of Romans chapter 7 verses 7 and 8 we're told that the mind of the flesh is enmity
[time=2368] against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are
[time=2375] in the flesh cannot please god that says that a man who who simply exists in the fleshly realm in
[time=2382] the realm of the world without any spiritual understanding that man of and by himself can never
[time=2389] reach out and touch the life of the spirit which is in Jesus Christ there is only one way that that
[time=2395] can happen and that is through a supernatural interposition of god the the father through the holy spirit in the life of a man you say pastor Jeremiah what is the flesh well the flesh is a
[time=2407] compulsive inner force which we have inherited from Adam's fall which exposes itself in general
[time=2414] and specific rebellion against god that part of me which says I can live my life apart from god
[time=2421] and his intervention in my life that part of me which expresses itself in the spirit of independence
[time=2427] see which is pictured and verbalized with the clenched fist toward god that part of me is my flesh and the bible says that which is flesh is what it's flesh it can't enter over into the
[time=2438] spiritual realm and men and women that's why the old flesh only gives us the equipment to live
[time=2444] in this world unless god gives us some new equipment we can't live in the spiritual realm that's why modern theology does not work in terms of the spiritual modern theology says what man
[time=2455] needs is reformation but reformation just makes a man live better in the flesh it doesn't help him to live in the spirit modern theology says what man needs is respectability and certainly there are
[time=2466] those who live in the realm of the flesh who have greater character and conduct themselves to conform to the standards of this world better than others but having respectability doesn't move you from the sphere of the flesh to the sphere of the spirit there are some folks in modern theology who tell us that we get from the sphere of the flesh to the sphere of the spirit through religion
[time=2488] but religion didn't do it for Nicodemus he was the most religious man of his day if you had gone
[time=2494] throughout the culture of Nicodemus day and said could you point to me a man who epitomizes what
[time=2500] a religious man ought to be you would have found Nicodemus to be on the top 10 list of almost everyone he was an incurable religionist but the bible says he had not moved from the flesh to the spirit
[time=2512] because religion couldn't do it for him there are some folks who believe that when we stand before God someday when we go to heaven that over the gates of the of the archway into heaven will be written these words admittance granted to those who have been baptized admittance granted to those
[time=2528] who have punctiliously attended church every week admittance granted to those who have partaken
[time=2535] of holy communion those who have tied those who have read the bible and prayed but that is not what is written over the gates of heaven what is written over the gates of heaven are the words of this chapter except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of god for you cannot get into the kingdom of god in the merits of the flesh one of the most profound
[time=2556] truths of all of the word of god is this there is the realm of the flesh and the realm of the spirit they do not coexist and you cannot cross the chasm between the two apart from a supernatural
[time=2567] intervention by god himself the second truth that is the profound truth of this passage
[time=2574] is that entrance into both of these spheres is by birth now let me ask you how did you enter into the sphere of the physical well you got in by natural birth by you came into this life
[time=2586] through a human birth process there is only one person in all the world who came into this world apart from adam and eve who were created apart from the natural generation of birth and and
[time=2598] that's the lord jesus christ who was born of a virgin supernaturally every one of us here are in the physical today most of you look like you're almost in the physical today all of us here today
[time=2608] are here because we have been born into this world through the natural process of birth but just as we enter into the realm of the flesh by birth so we must enter into the realm of the
[time=2619] spirit by birth just as i have a physical birthday so i must have a spiritual birthday now you say how does that happen well the bible gives to us a commentary on what it means to be
[time=2630] born of god that commentary is in the first chapter of this same gospel verses 12 and 13
[time=2636] it gives to us three things that being born spiritually is not and one that it is and i'd like for you to look at that commentary with me john chapter one verses 12 and 13
[time=2646] but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the children of god that's spiritually
[time=2654] born even to them who believe on his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[time=2660] nor of the will of man but of god now this commentary on john chapter three tells us that
[time=2667] spiritual birth comes about in a certain and specific and unique way first of all the text
[time=2673] tells us that it does not come because we are born of the blood that means that in spiritual birth
[time=2679] there is no connection whatsoever with natural descent i grew up in the family of a college president and a longtime baptist preacher godly mother and father but i did not inherit my christianity
[time=2691] there was a day as a teenager when i had to recognize that it was a personal relationship between god and myself salvation does not run in the blood it is implanted by god the holy spirit
[time=2704] in the spirit of man we have some good illustrations of that truth in the physical realm today
[time=2710] all of you have been reading with great interest all of the things that are happening with the very unique and uh and unnatural and supernatural almost kinds of births that have been taking place
[time=2721] not too long ago as we were at our staff retreat we viewed the film future shock which was filmed
[time=2730] seven years ago in the film they predicted that sometime in the future there would be a child born who had not been conceived in the normal natural way but had been prepared in a special way in a
[time=2742] test tube on the very day that we saw that film on the pages of all of the papers across the country
[time=2748] was a picture of the young lady who fulfilled that prophecy which only seven years ago had seemed rather outlandish to the one who had who had prophesied it today we are told that life can
[time=2760] be conceived in a special way outside of the mother's womb and that life then through a surgical process
[time=2767] can be implanted within the mother and then a baby is born in a very real sense that is a picture of
[time=2774] what the new birth is there is no way through the natural process of heredity that a man can receive
[time=2781] spiritual life i am not a christian today because i received some spiritual genes from my father i am a christian today because god the father through the ministry of the holy spirit
[time=2792] divinely implanted within me the seed of the spirit according to first john and i had a spiritual
[time=2799] implantation of divine life that happened the moment that i received jesus christ is my savior
[time=2805] the bible says we are born not of blood now notice secondly that it says we are born not of the will
[time=2812] of the flesh that means there is no connection with natural volition there are some folks today
[time=2818] that say we get into heaven and we get into god's family because of a great intense desire we will
[time=2824] ourselves to be christians if we want to be christians we can be and yet the bible clearly teaches that it is not of him that worketh or of him that runneth nor of him that willeth
[time=2835] but of god that showeth mercy roman's nine sixteen that means i can't even want to bad enough to
[time=2842] become a christian even my will is a part of the fleshly realm everything that i want everything
[time=2848] that i desire is over here in this circle and in my flesh i can want to and desire to and will to
[time=2854] but it will never get me out of that circle over into the circle of the spirit you are not born
[time=2860] of blood nor of the will of the flesh notice thirdly you are not born spiritually by the will of man
[time=2867] that means that my birth my spiritual birth has no connection whatsoever with any natural
[time=2874] relationships i have in this realm in other words that means that no one else in this circle of the flesh can do anything to me as another human being which will cause me to move out of this realm
[time=2885] and into this realm you say what about preachers what about soul winners what about godly parents what about christians schoolteachers oh yes there are instruments and tools that god uses
[time=2896] but mark it down and be careful that you understand it no human being unaided by god can ever affect a spiritual change in the life of another fleshly brother the only thing that
[time=2907] can happen to move me out of the circle of the flesh this sphere of the flesh is for god to intervene in my life and it caused me to be born in a special way spiritually as i was physically
[time=2918] know the bible says we are not born again of the blood we are not born again of the will of man of
[time=2926] the will of the flesh but what is the rest of it but of god god is the one who affects the new birth
[time=2934] in our lives we can be involved in the process we can be mediators in in in the state of god to
[time=2940] communicate the truth to communicate the message but unless god reaches down in a supernatural way
[time=2947] and takes a hold of my life and opens my life upward to heaven and makes it possible for me to understand and comprehend the word of god it is not possible for me to pass from the flesh
[time=2959] to the spirit we are born of god now these profound truths which we have discussed from this chapter
[time=2966] truths which tell us that there are two spheres in which man live the flesh and the spirit
[time=2972] that entrance into both is by birth that flesh begets flesh and spirit begets spirit and that
[time=2979] anyone who wishes to pass out of the flesh into the spirit can only do so by the second birth these great truths were the truths which came in upon the consciousness of Nicodemus but he misunderstood them he related all of the spiritual truth to the physical realm and so
[time=2995] what did he say he said well i don't understand this lord i do want to start over again i realized that my life is kind of messed up and i'd like to have a new start are you telling me i have to go back again into my mother's room and be reborn physically no the lord jesus said Nicodemus you do
[time=3012] need a new start but it's not a new start physically it's a new start spiritually and no you cannot go back into your mother's womb and be born again physically but you can receive the new birth spiritually and then the rest of this text goes on to explain what that
[time=3026] spiritual need is now it's interesting to me that Nicodemus came under great conviction when these
[time=3032] truths entered his heart it is not hard to understand his conviction for he was in the presence of the almighty god the son of god clothed in the flesh jesus christ but notice the tools of conviction
[time=3043] which the lord uses first of all he chides him verse 10 we're told that jesus said unto him
[time=3050] art thou a teacher of israel and you don't know these things Nicodemus where have you been all your life you're supposed to be standing up teaching everyone what it's all about and you don't even know the milk truths of god's word that you can't get from the flesh to the spirit unless you'll be born again how did you become a teacher and I think if the lord were alive today and looked out over Christendom and all of the people who have risen to places of leadership and respect ability in the quote unquote church he would have to say those same things to many are you
[time=3078] teachers in the church and you don't even know these things have you ever have you ever been surprised at how intellectual people can so confuse the truth of god's word that when you get done you are in worse shape than when you came in there are some folks who have been elevated to places of responsibility and teaching and feeding who don't know the basic truth that's the first thing he said but then he said Nicodemus it's not enough that you don't know them the second
[time=3103] problem is that having known what you do know you won't receive it verse 11 fairly i say unto thee we speak that which we do know and testify to that which we have seen and you receive not a witness Nicodemus even when we try to help you understand what is involved in the flesh and the
[time=3119] spirit and how to get from one to the other we try to tell you and you don't understand Nicodemus had asked him a physical question he had asked him about the miracles and the
[time=3129] and the physical things and Jesus said Nicodemus how in the world are you going to understand anything i say if you can't understand the basic truths how are you going to understand the great truths of heavenly nature well when i used to read this passage of scripture i always wondered
[time=3144] what happened to Nicodemus boy had an encounter that wouldn't quit Jesus met him at the point of his need and took him beyond his need to his real need and it doesn't tell us here what happened but you know the other two references about Nicodemus in the book of john help us to understand that
[time=3159] this encounter changed his life here was a man as a Pharisee who had no right to respect Jesus
[time=3166] as an intruder into the judeistic tradition but when we turn in our bibles to the seventh chapter
[time=3172] of john verses 50 and 51 and we see Jesus under fire by the Pharisees out of whom Nicodemus had come
[time=3179] we see Nicodemus rising to the forefront of the discussion and in essence protecting Jesus from the the attacks of his brother Pharisees john chapter seven verses 50 and 51 and this is
[time=3193] what the bible says from the from the new testament Nicodemus saith unto them the other Pharisees
[time=3199] notice again Nicodemus the one that came to Jesus by night being one of them doth our law judge any
[time=3206] man before it hear him and know what he do it they answered and saith unto him art thou also Galilee search and look for out of Galilee a rise of no prophet and every man went to his own house they were trying to figure out Jesus and Nicodemus said listen you examine what he is and what he does
[time=3222] and and don't judge him until you find out the reality of him almost as if to say listen I know what's happened because this man came into my life and then they identified Nicodemus with Jesus
[time=3233] say let me say something to you one of the sheer evidences that something's happened in your life spiritually is when people start getting you confused with the Christian crowd when people start thinking that maybe you belong to the Lord when they start saying well yeah he's from Galilee isn't Jesus those people are sort of alike but the clear evidence of his rebirth because of this
[time=3251] encounter is found in the 19th chapter of John in the events which surrounded our Lord's death in his burial for we read that this one who came to Jesus by night to have his need met
[time=3264] came also to the burial of Jesus and in John 19 verse 39 we read and there came also Nicodemus
[time=3272] who at the first came to Jesus by night and he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about in 100 pound weight how do we know that Nicodemus was a Christian no Jewish Pharisee would dared
[time=3284] have crossed the lines from the Judaism accusation of Jesus Christ and his crucifixion to risk his
[time=3291] life in the burial procedures of the Savior with this adoration and love of the burial spices had he
[time=3297] not had a strong relationship with the one whom he worshiped it is quite obvious that that night
[time=3303] Nicodemus came to Jesus to have a outward need met and Jesus perceived beyond his outward
[time=3311] circumstances and took him from the flesh to the spirit now the question that I want to ask you is
[time=3317] this are you still fooling around over here in the flesh over in this world trying to think out
[time=3323] away to make yourself better are you still trying to figure out a way to bring yourself up by your
[time=3329] bootstraps to the level of the spiritual or have you come to the end of yourself and are you willing
[time=3335] to say Lord nothing in my hands I bring I've tried every way I can and I can't bridge the
[time=3342] chasm from the flesh to the spirit and so out of my emptiness I cry out for the spirit of God to
[time=3348] come and implant his divine nature in my life when you come to the end of yourself and recognize
[time=3355] your need and when you reach out by faith to receive Christ then that divine implantation takes place and you pass from life to death from the flesh to the spirit and you understand what
[time=3368] Jesus said when he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God shall we pray
[time=3379] and with our heads bowed and our eyes closed as we close this hour if you have not been born again
[time=3386] if you have not accepted Christ as your Savior right now wherever you are in this auditorium or as you watch at home you can invite Jesus Christ to come into your life you can say Lord Jesus I recognize
[time=3398] my need I know that I am without God I cannot measure up in the flesh and so I ask you to come
[time=3406] in I want to be born anew in the spiritual realm I want Jesus Christ to come and live within me and
[time=3414] change me from the inside out and as you pray that prayer he'll do just that he'll come in today
