[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=7] >> From the Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=17] [MUSIC]
[time=47] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=65] >> And we welcome you to this service.
[time=71] This is the second service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church on this morning.
[time=75] We're grateful to have all of you who've joined us now by television.
[time=78] We hope this will be a great blessing to you as you share this hour with us.
[time=82] In a few moments, we're going to be opening the Word of God to the New Testament Book of Revelation.
[time=87] And we're going to discuss together a very pertinent message that I think applies to all of us in this day and age.
[time=93] It is one of the fitting climaxes to our series of messages this summer as it deals with the place of the church in our world today.
[time=101] I'm going to be speaking on the subject of the church at Laodicea.
[time=105] What does it have to say to us today in this generation?
[time=108] I hope you'll stay with us through the entire hour as we share together the blessing of God from His Word.
[time=115] [MUSIC - 299 seconds]
[time=442] We're so glad that you've joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=445] As you well know, we're deep in the summer series, and these are very special days for us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, days of great opportunity, and also days of great responsibility.
[time=456] I want to say to you as honestly as I can, that during this particular time in our season, we need to hear from you, from each and every one of you who count the Bible Hour as a part of your own spiritual ministry.
[time=467] Many of you have been thinking about writing to us.
[time=470] You're planning to do it perhaps when the fall rolls around, and you get back into the routine, but we need to hear from you now.
[time=477] And we would hope that all of you would take the opportunity right now while I'm reminding you to make sure you get the address that we give you in a few moments and sit down and write us a letter.
[time=487] If you've appreciated the messages during the summer dealing with the issues that we've addressed, we'd like to hear from you.
[time=493] Your encouragement, your prayer, your financial support during this season is very crucial to the ongoing ministry of the Bible Hour Television Program.
[time=501] During these days, we've been planning expansion through the National Christian Network.
[time=506] We are planning expansion through the Dayton Springfield Station here in our own Midwestern area.
[time=511] And through all of these days, we need to know that you're standing with us in prayer and in your financial support.
[time=518] So sit down and write us today, will you?
[time=520] When you write, if you're not already involved in the daily walk, I hope you will take time to let us know that you'd like to be involved in a daily Bible study.
[time=529] A daily walk is a program that gets you into the Word of God each day, and if you're faithful, makes it possible for you to read through the entire Bible in a year's time.
[time=538] Right now, in the study program that we're involved in, we're studying the Old Testament book of Ezekiel.
[time=545] And if you were following along with us at this particular time, you would find it very helpful in understanding that Old Testament prophet.
[time=552] I hope that you will write to us this week.
[time=554] Let us know that you'd like to be a part of the daily walk program and join our Bible reading family.
[time=559] Now, some of you are not going to write because you're just not going to take time to do it, but you'd still like to have the daily walk.
[time=567] And we've made it as easy for you as possible in that we have put together a toll-free number
[time=573] that makes it possible for you to call us without any charge, any place in the United States, and request the daily walk.
[time=579] Now, that number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=584] Once again, the number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=588] When you call, ask for the Bible hour operator, tell her you'd like to enroll in the daily walk, and she'll send your name and address right to us, and we in turn will make it possible for you to get your daily walk program started.
[time=601] We also want to remind you that in your daily walk with the Lord, there are times when you need some extra help in finding passages of Scripture that will be an encouragement and a time of blessing and encouragement in your own life,
[time=615] and we've put together a very special little book called the Answer Book.
[time=619] And I found this very helpful, even in my own ministry.
[time=622] The other day, as I was thinking about the subject of loneliness, I looked up that topic in this booklet, and I found several very helpful passages that were just sort of triggered in my own mind and caused me to think of some other passages as well.
[time=635] Now, the Answer Book has verses printed out in detail under each topic, and then at the back of the book, there is a further listing of key passages on many very helpful subjects.
[time=646] The Answer Book is small, it can fit in your pocket or purse, you can carry it with you wherever you go, and we'd like to send this to you as our free gift to you at this time as you watch the Bible hour.
[time=656] So, if you'd like to have your free copy of the Answer Book, all you need to do is call us at that toll-free number, 1-800-45-39000, or write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=670] We'd be so happy to hear from you during these days, we need to hear from you, and we pray that you will respond to us in a very tangible way as you sit down and get in touch with us today.
[time=681] Once again, the toll-free number is 1-800-45-39000, and you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=691] Now, we're going back to our morning service, and I trust that you'll stay with us as we open the Word of God to the Old Testament Book of Revelation and a very key message on the Church of Today, as we talk about God's message to the Church at Laodicea.

[time=1129] This is the message to the last church, the church at Laodicea.
[time=1140] I'm reading in my Bible from the third chapter of the book of Revelation.
[time=1144] Verses 14 through 19.
[time=1148] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 through 19.
[time=1154] And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans, right?
[time=1160] These things saith the Amen, the faithful and the true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.
[time=1169] I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot.
[time=1174] I would thou art to cold or hot.
[time=1177] So then, because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[time=1185] Because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing.
[time=1191] And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.
[time=1197] I counsel thee to buy of me gold, try it in the fire.
[time=1201] That thou mayest be rich and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with salve that thou mayest see.
[time=1213] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten, be zealous therefore and repent. Shall we pray together?
[time=1222] God, in heaven, we come into thy presence tonight, mindful of our need of thee.
[time=1229] It is a day that has spent us emotionally,
[time=1237] and certainly there are many others in that category here tonight.
[time=1242] We have a wonderful opportunity to understand what Paul meant when he said that when he was weak he was strong.
[time=1249] So we pray that you will move into our emptiness and fill us with thy spirit.
[time=1255] Move into our weakness and fill us with thy strength.
[time=1260] May the message of the word of God tonight pierce down deep into our very being
[time=1267] that each of us may be caused to reevaluate our relationship with thee.
[time=1273] The sobering message indeed, one that challenges all of us.
[time=1278] Lord, there will be a tendency tonight for us to put around ourselves
[time=1284] a wall of protection to be as it were indifferent to what God would say to us
[time=1293] because certainly it was not meant for me, it was meant for others.
[time=1299] I pray that by the Spirit of God you will break down all of the defenses that we in our own humanity might construct to keep God away from the core of our being
[time=1310] and cause that even as we hear the word of God taught there might be something in us responding that says, Lord, what will thou have me to do?
[time=1319] And that willingly we will obey whatever the Spirit of God might say.
[time=1325] We thank you for the Spirit's ministry among us and in us and through the word of God which he has given to us,
[time=1331] we ask thy blessing upon the teaching and preaching of his word.
[time=1335] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1340] The churches of Revelation, an interesting group of individual congregations
[time=1347] which God used as an illustration, both historically and prophetically,
[time=1355] churches to which he gave individual special messages, which coincided with the needs of the churches as they were geographically located,
[time=1366] but churches also that represent great historical periods of time,
[time=1372] starting with the apostolic church represented by the church at Ephesus and continuing down through the Philadelphia Age as we discuss last time unto the Laodicean Age, which is our topic for tonight.
[time=1386] One may study these churches geographically and historically.
[time=1391] One may study these churches prophetically as they depict the ages of the church in its history.
[time=1399] And one may study these churches individually as they represent the various attitudes
[time=1405] and climates of the individual Christian's heart.
[time=1409] It is interesting that as we look at these seven churches, that in the first six instances, God has something good to say about all of them.
[time=1419] For instance, to the church at Ephesus, he commended them for long suffering and for dealing with false teachers.
[time=1426] To the church at Smyrna, he commended them for faithfulness in tribulation and in persecution.
[time=1432] To that church located in Pergamos, he told them that they did well
[time=1438] and that they held fast the name of God.
[time=1441] To the church at Thyatira, he talked to approvingly of their charity
[time=1447] and of their service and of their faith.
[time=1450] To the church in Sardis, he mentioned that there were a few there, a few names in that city and in that church which had not defiled their garments.
[time=1461] To the church in Philadelphia, he said they were people with a grand opportunity before them that they could walk through for the kingdom of God and for the progress of the gospel.
[time=1473] But it is an overwhelming fact that when we come to the church at Laodicea, God has no good thing to say.
[time=1479] It is the only church among the seven about which there is no positive comment made.
[time=1485] Simply the white, hot statements of the Spirit of God scoring that church for her failures.
[time=1496] Now may I point out to you that the church of Laodicea represents historically that period of time immediately before the return of Christ for his own.
[time=1506] The characteristics of the church of Laodicea are the characteristics which will be running rampant in the days before the Lord returns.
[time=1514] I told you when we met the last time that I felt like we were certainly in the closing days of the Philadelphia Age,
[time=1521] that there was an overlap between the Philadelphia Age and the Laodicean Age, that we could understand that we were in the closing days of the Philadelphia Age because the church of Philadelphia represented the period of open doors and of opportunities,
[time=1535] and gradually one by one many of those opportunities are closing and so the Philadelphia Age is coming to a conclusion.
[time=1543] And the overlap is beginning and the early days of the Laodicean Age are starting.
[time=1549] One cannot possibly guess nor estimate where we may be in the Laodicean period, but believe me folks, we are in the beginning at least of that age which will be consummated when the Lord Jesus returns in that which we know as the rapture.
[time=1564] So as we study this church tonight, let us remember that it perhaps has more to say to us today
[time=1570] than any of the churches we have studied here to four.
[time=1574] First of all, let's take just a moment and notice the destination of this letter.
[time=1579] It is a letter which is sent to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans.
[time=1586] Now Laodicea was the most south-easterly of the seven cities to which letters were sent.
[time=1594] It was a city founded by Antiochus II.
[time=1598] He named the city for his wife whose name was Laodicea.
[time=1603] And so we have the name of the city from the wife of the founder.
[time=1607] It is a church which is mentioned earlier in the New Testament, in a book which we just recently finished studying.
[time=1614] It is mentioned at the close of the book of Colossians, where we're told when this pistol is read, meaning the book of Colossians, be sure that it also be read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that she likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.
[time=1632] That the church of Laodicea was a viable historical place, cannot be denied because of the reference to it in the book of Colossians.
[time=1640] It was a historical church to which Paul referred when he wrote to the church at Colossi,
[time=1646] and it was not far from the city of Colossi, part of four or five cities that clustered together.
[time=1653] Now in all of the letters that we have studied, we have noticed that God distinguishes himself in a certain way because of the message that he is going to give to the church.
[time=1661] And this is no exception.
[time=1663] We notice after the destination of the letter, the designation of the Lord.
[time=1668] Notice how he is referred to in this passage of Scripture.
[time=1672] These things say at the Amen, the faithful and true witness, and the beginning of the creation of God.
[time=1679] These designations for the Lord seem to answer the question, what right does the Lord have to say the things that he's going to say?
[time=1689] As we have already read from the text, he makes some very vitriolic statements about this church and their lack and their sin.
[time=1698] One might well ask the question, what right does he have to make such accusations?
[time=1705] May I remind you that he is the Lord who is referred to as the Amen, as the Verily,
[time=1711] as the one whose word is fixed and cannot be changed.
[time=1717] The word Amen, which we rarely hear in our services, is a word which means so be it.
[time=1726] Yes, it's fixed, it's true, it's absolute, Amen.
[time=1730] And the Lord is designated as the Amen, the one whose word is fixed and is unchangeable,
[time=1737] so when he speaks to the church, we do well to listen.
[time=1743] He is also addressed as the faithful and true witness, which is a synonymous term for the first one.
[time=1749] His word is true, his word is faithful, it cannot be bartered with or argued with,
[time=1755] what he says is true.
[time=1759] And he is also referred to as the beginning of the creation of God, a term which is synonymous to some of the terms in the books of 1 John, which talk about the preeminent relationship of Jesus Christ to this world.
[time=1775] He was in the world before the world was, it has nothing to do with the fact that he was created,
[time=1781] but it means he is the priority over creation.
[time=1784] So when one examines the text, recognizing that the one who speaks tonight is the Amen, the faithful and the true and the first born from among many, we recognize that what he has to say is worth listening to.
[time=1797] Folks, you better take it down in your own heart and in your mind that what God says in this passage cannot be disputed.
[time=1805] Now notice thirdly, the denunciation of the church.
[time=1811] Basically in the text, the church is denounced for two things.
[time=1816] First of all, it is denounced for its indifference.
[time=1821] The scripture says that this church had a problem that was understood by the fact that it was neither hot nor was it cold,
[time=1833] but it was lukewarm. It was tepid, if you will.
[time=1840] I don't know if you've ever had the experience as I have on a number of occasions to recognize in the middle of the night that you are thirsty and stumble out of bed with your eyes half open, fumbling your way to the bathroom looking for a glass.
[time=1859] Finding a glass, you turn on the water and fill up the glass, and you take a drink of tepid water.
[time=1867] It is the most disgusting and abominable thing that there is in all the world.
[time=1873] When God said that this church was not hot nor cold, but in between lukewarm,
[time=1879] we should not be surprised to discover that his response to that was that he spewed it out of his mouth.
[time=1886] Now what does he mean when he said the church was lukewarm?
[time=1890] Well, obviously he's talking about the fact that they lacked enthusiasm.
[time=1895] They were not white-hot Christians excited about their faith.
[time=1899] They were just, you know, okay.
[time=1903] He was talking about their lack of position.
[time=1907] They were middle-of-the-road Christians.
[time=1910] I could not help but think about this church in relationship to a conversation
[time=1918] that I read about where a very important man was examined on the subject of his faith.
[time=1924] He was asked, "What do you believe?" And he answered, "I believe what the church believes.
[time=1930] Why what then does the church believe?" He was asked and he said, "The church believes what I believe.
[time=1938] Tell me then I pray, what is it which you and your church both believe?
[time=1944] Why, truly, sir, the church and I both believe the same thing.
[time=1950] How many Christians do you know like that?
[time=1953] Why, they are middle-of-the-road Christians.
[time=1956] They're not over here and they're not over here.
[time=1958] They're just sort of plunked down right in the middle.
[time=1961] It's not that they believe anything for sure or disbelieve anything for sure.
[time=1966] They're just sort of glad to be here." And that's what happened in the Church of Laodicea.
[time=1973] The Lord said, "You're a lukewarm, not hot, not cold, just in between." Had to do with their enthusiasm, had to do with their position, also had to do with their mission.
[time=1984] They forgot what they were about.
[time=1989] My father, who is now, if I dare say it, the retired president of Cedarville College and its chancellor, has been traveling the country over these past weeks, preaching every week in a different church, in a different part of the country.
[time=2003] And when we get together, one of the things we share is the misery of such an occupation.
[time=2010] For he describes for me often the Laodiceanism that is rampant through the churches of our country,
[time=2017] churches that just come together on Sunday.
[time=2020] They're not even sure what for, and they go through the process of Christianity.
[time=2024] They sing a few hymns, and they take up an offering, and someone gets up and speaks.
[time=2028] Nobody ever gets saved. Nothing ever happens.
[time=2031] No one ever comes to Christ.
[time=2033] They can't even stir up a good fuss.
[time=2040] Such was the Church at Laodicea.
[time=2043] They were indifferent to doctrine.
[time=2047] They were indifferent to the teaching of God.
[time=2050] Their attitude was, is the attitude of many I talk to today why.
[time=2054] One religion is just as good as another, just as long as you're in church.
[time=2064] The church sports a kind of goodishness, sort of civic betterment program.
[time=2071] Pay your debts and don't kill anyone, they say.
[time=2077] They worship God and they worship the world.
[time=2079] Bail and Jehovah, they try to mix.
[time=2083] They're indifferent in devotion.
[time=2085] They're indifferent in zeal.
[time=2088] They're indifferent in whole, sold earnestness.
[time=2092] To the Laodiceans, like many today, to be enthusiastic about God and about Christ and His work would be offensive
[time=2100] to cultured people.
[time=2105] I've gotten word from some of the folks about town that some of the things we've been saying of recent date are rather offensive to their culture.
[time=2119] One of the often, often heard expressions of our evangelism teams, and I've heard it so many times that I could catalog it for you.
[time=2126] When folks come here to church and they sit under the preaching of the Word of God and they go through an invitation and we go and visit them, maybe they haven't come back.
[time=2136] And we'll say to them why we're glad you came to visit us and we'd just like to invite you to come and be with us.
[time=2143] Well, Pastor, I hope you won't be offended.
[time=2146] But I don't think we're going to come back.
[time=2148] We've found another church.
[time=2150] Oh, yes, we just feel more comfortable over there.
[time=2157] I don't know where anyone ever got the idea that we're supposed to go to church to be comfortable.
[time=2165] I've often held to the fact that the pastor's responsibility is twofold.
[time=2170] It is to comfort the afflicted, but it is also to afflict the comfortable.
[time=2176] The church of Laodicea was that kind of a church which just liked to go along and take care of the going to church.
[time=2191] As long as nobody did anything, upset the apple card or said anything that would be offensive,
[time=2197] sort of a syrupy sentimentality that was insipid enough that it never touched anybody on either side of the fence.
[time=2208] Do you know folks?
[time=2210] There are many, many churches in our culture today whose main objective when it comes to the preaching of the Word of God
[time=2218] is to say something so neutral that nobody ever gets offended.
[time=2223] I know of a godly pastor in a denominational church who was run out of his church because he tried to preach the gospel which the Bible says is an offense.
[time=2233] And the leaders of the church got together and said, "We'd rather have someone else.
[time=2238] You're too disturbing to us." And he was moved off to another assignment.
[time=2243] That's the way the church of Laodicea was. It was indifferent.
[time=2248] It's interesting to me that in our culture we are allowed to get enthusiastic about everything except the Lord.
[time=2254] We're enthusiastic about sports. I often think as I worship in this building that if I could generate as much enthusiasm as Sunday,
[time=2262] as we generate here sometimes on a Friday night ball game, we could turn this town upside down.
[time=2268] But the fact of the matter is I've actually seen people jump out of their seat when the person next to him came to church thinking this was an amen church
[time=2279] and he said amen and they weren't ready for it.
[time=2285] We can be enthusiastic about entertainment and about literature and about advancement in science, but in our Christianity we have no zeal and no enthusiasm.
[time=2295] And it's no wonder God isn't doing anything through us in this day.
[time=2300] There's nothing but deadness of soul. We're tepid. We're lukewarm.
[time=2306] God is not honored by that.
[time=2309] In Laodicea, in the actual city of Laodicea was a town that was known for its water springs.
[time=2317] Hot mineral springs surrounded the city and some very cold springs also.
[time=2324] And the Laodiceans in their culture and in their engineering figured out a way to get the water from the springs to their city.
[time=2332] They constructed a very, very vast and intricate over the top of the land system that carried the water from the springs to the city.
[time=2344] And some of it traveled many miles across the top of the land actually being pumped or forced through these conduits to the city itself.
[time=2353] And historians tell us that one of the problems that they encountered in their system was that the hot water which they desired to keep hot would often cool off on its way to the city and the cold water which they desired to keep cold would often heat up or become lukewarm on its way to the city.
[time=2370] And so when they would take that which came through the conduit to apply it thinking it was hot or cold oftentimes they would discover that it fit neither of their purposes.
[time=2379] It was lukewarm and it wasn't good for anything.
[time=2384] So when this book is written to the church at Laodicea they surely understood what was being said that something that's lukewarm that isn't cold or hot is really of no value.
[time=2396] The problem with this church was they were indifferent.
[time=2402] I say to you tonight no matter where you come from culturally or where you consider yourself to be in the prestige ladder there is no religion without enthusiasm.
[time=2414] Enthusiasm is a word which means God in you it may not be as outwardly as mine is sometimes but if you haven't got anything that excites you you probably haven't been bitten by the real bug.
[time=2427] Religion is fire in the bones it is moving in the soul it is stirring in the heart it is singing with zest it's being excited about something it is not apathetic lethargic and lukewarm and that was the problem with that church.
[time=2442] Men and women that is the way you could describe many of the churches where people file in almost as if they are in a days and they sit down in the pew and someone gets up and says some inane thing and they file out and I've had people say I might as well not have gone because nothing happened.
[time=2461] Unless you think I'm talking just about other churches then ours may I share with you that this is not only a church matter but an individual matter and there are some of you folks who used to be white hot for God who have become lukewarm in your experience.
[time=2474] You're not excited about anything you're pretty much against everything you come and you sit and you soak in your sour and you spread your misery everywhere you go.
[time=2485] God isn't any more happy with you than he is with the Church of Laodicea about what you wrote in this book.
[time=2491] Secondly this church is denounced for its humanism.
[time=2495] That may be a new word to some of you but it's an old doctrine.
[time=2499] I never have seen such a good definition of humanism in all my life as I found in this text.
[time=2505] Dr. Lahey talked about it for a long time I don't know why it didn't come here because this is the best definition of humanism I've ever found.
[time=2512] Humanism is life without God.
[time=2516] Notice how it is described here.
[time=2520] Verse 17, "Thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and thou and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."
[time=2532] What is this person saying? He's saying, "I've got what I need. I don't need God.
[time=2537] I've got everything. Don't give me Jesus." As the men saying this morning, "I don't need him. I'm complete without him. I'm rich. I'm clothed in all that I need. I've got everything."
[time=2548] That's what humanism says. Humanism is life minus God.
[time=2552] It is life tried to be tried to be lived sufficiently minus the supernatural.
[time=2558] And that's what was wrong here.
[time=2561] God was not involved in them and with them.
[time=2566] You know, it's a strange thing, but there are lots of churches where God never goes because he's not invited.
[time=2578] And so the churches have programs instead of power.
[time=2581] They have organizers instead of agonizers.
[time=2585] They have no need for God.
[time=2587] They have intellectualism instead of sermons.
[time=2590] No need for God.
[time=2592] They have ritual instead of worship. No need for God.
[time=2596] They have social action instead of evangelism. No need for God.
[time=2602] I'm rich. I have need of nothing.
[time=2607] We aren't going to have time to get to it, but that's why down in verse 20, we see God standing at the outside of the door, knocking, trying to get in.
[time=2617] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=2621] If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me.
[time=2627] We've often used that verse to demonstrate the fact that Christ knocks at the outside of the heart's door.
[time=2632] And that's true, but the primary meaning of that verse in its context is that Jesus Christ is standing outside of the door of the Church of Laodicea trying to get in because he's not on the inside.
[time=2644] And it is a sad and pathetic and heart-rending thing to drive through a city
[time=2652] the size of hours and cities like ours and bigger and see church-building after church-building and envision in your mind what goes on there on Sunday and almost picture in your mind's eye.
[time=2662] Jesus Christ standing at the front door wanting to get in the Church that bears his name.
[time=2672] What was wrong with this Church in its humanism was threefold.
[time=2678] First of all, their values were wrong.
[time=2681] Notice, just look in the text.
[time=2684] They said, "We are rich." Christ said, "You're poor." They said, "We have increased goods to make us happy." Christ said, "You are wretched and miserable." They said, "We have need of nothing." Christ said, "You are blind and naked." "We do not need God," said they.
[time=2712] "We do not need man.
[time=2714] We do not need anything.
[time=2716] We are complete and self-sufficient in ourselves." That's what humanism says.
[time=2722] Humanism is at the very core of all of the self-help literature of our day.
[time=2729] Now, much of that can be very beneficial if it's seen in the context of the spiritual.
[time=2741] But folks, there is not within you the human power to be other than you are apart from the intervention in your life
[time=2749] of Jesus Christ in the Spirit of God.
[time=2756] Not only was their value system wrong, according to the text, their vesture was wrong.
[time=2763] Notice, they said, it says in verse 18, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[time=2773] and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed." Verse 17 says, "They were naked.
[time=2779] That the shame of thy nakedness do not appear." What was he talking about?
[time=2784] He was talking about the white raiment of Christ's righteousness, which they were lacking.
[time=2789] They had tried to dress themselves up in their own righteousness and what they did and what they were accomplishing.
[time=2795] And they were saying, "Look at us, what we've done, our program and our benefit in this project and that project and these buildings and all that we've accomplished." And the Lord looked down with His X-ray vision at them and He said, "You are naked." Because when you dress up in your own righteousness, the Bible says, "Those are us filthy rags and filthy rags
[time=2814] don't hold together, they just fall right off." Jesus said, "What you need is the white raiment that is the righteousness of Christ."
[time=2826] That's the only thing that dresses you up.
[time=2830] One of the fears that haunts me is your pastor.
[time=2834] One of the things that finds its way into my prayers is that with all that God has done here,
[time=2842] He might not ever be on the outside knocking trying to get in.
[time=2848] This is not the Black Hawk Baptist Church and its accomplishment.
[time=2852] This is not Pastor Jeremiah and what he's done.
[time=2856] This is the work of God Almighty.
[time=2860] And as long as we're willing to just wear a suit of clothes that is Jesus Christ
[time=2868] and give Him the glory and make it possible for all that's done to be attributed to what He is
[time=2875] and who He is and how He's worked in our midst, there's no limit to what God will do for us.
[time=2880] As we look at the Arlington Project and think about the Family Life Center, as we shall see in a few moments tonight, it's an overwhelming thing. It is so big and so grand and so tremendous and so challenging that if God doesn't do it, it can't be done.
[time=2897] One of the things that excites me about that, folks, is that if indeed that's true, when it is done,
[time=2903] only God can take credit for it.
[time=2910] If the legislature was wrong, they needed the righteousness of Christ. Thirdly, their vision was wrong.
[time=2915] Notice what it says at the end of verse 18.
[time=2918] "Anoint thine eyes with Sav that thou mayest see." They'd lost their vision.
[time=2926] According to history in the city of Laodicea, they were famous for a certain kind of eyesab called Tefra Fragilla.
[time=2936] It was a special product that the Laodiceans had manufacturers for which they were famous.
[time=2942] It was a tablet which was sold all over that part of the world.
[time=2947] And when people would come for this special tablet, they would buy it and they would crush it and put it in their eyes to heal eye problems.
[time=2955] And so when John, when the writer of this letter wrote about buying eyesab to heal their vision,
[time=2962] they all understood the terminology that what the problem was, that their eyes had become clogged,
[time=2968] that they'd forgotten to see, and that their vision was impaired and they needed something to straighten that all out.
[time=2975] Say, have you ever seen a liberal church with a vision?
[time=2981] Do you know what the greatest project of a liberal church is?
[time=2987] It's to try to keep from failing. They never think about succeeding.
[time=2992] Their whole vision is to try to keep from failure.
[time=2995] If we can just hang in there a little bit longer and keep from failing another year.
[time=3000] What a terrible way to live.
[time=3003] God has not called us to avoid failure.
[time=3009] He's called us to achieve success and have great vision for him.
[time=3015] And here these folks were and laid to see, their eyes were clogged, they couldn't see, there was no vision.
[time=3020] And so it is with so many churches today, their vision was wrong.
[time=3027] And God said, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[time=3039] Failure letters when God dealt with bad doctrine, he got angry.
[time=3045] In this letter, when he dealt with indifference, he got sick.
[time=3053] Now let me be very personal to you tonight.
[time=3059] Are you lukewarm?
[time=3062] Are you?
[time=3068] Is there time in your life when you were so excited about Jesus Christ?
[time=3074] All you had to do was be pointed in the right direction and you went.
[time=3079] Witness, you bet.
[time=3081] Come to church every time the doors were open.
[time=3084] Anytime there was help needed, you were the first in line to volunteer.
[time=3089] Always with a positive and exciting word for Jesus Christ in the ministry of His church, which was yours.
[time=3096] Boy, I remember watching some of you were so apparent that that was true.
[time=3104] One of the joys of watching new converts come to Christ as I look out over this congregation is to see the zeal and the white-hot enthusiasm for God.
[time=3114] Some of you started out that way, but little by little, disappointment here.
[time=3120] A little failure in your personal discipline with Christ here.
[time=3124] Another interest which took first place over here.
[time=3128] Personal problem with someone over here and your enthusiasm began to wane and your zeal began to dissipate.
[time=3138] And tonight there's no better way to describe you than that you're just lukewarm, tepid.
[time=3146] Oh, you're here in church. It's the respectable thing to do, but your enthusiasm's gone, and your spirit's gone, and your zeal's gone, and your desire's gone, and your heart is cold.
[time=3163] And you find terrible struggles with your attitude and your lukewarm.
[time=3171] Oh, there have been times like that in my life.
[time=3176] When I found my heart getting cold toward God, when the activities, even of the ministry, just became commonplace and routine, and it's what has to be done tomorrow, so I do it.
[time=3195] How thankful I am for the Word of God which arrested me in those periods of time and helped me to understand that I have the capacity as a Christian to be nauseating to my God.
[time=3208] And I'm not as hot for God as I ought to be, but I know this, I don't want that kind of a spirit to take over my life, and I don't want it to take over your lives.
[time=3221] And I pray that by the Spirit of God tonight, He will convict you if that's where you are.
[time=3226] And He will call you back to a place of zeal and enthusiasm for Him, and determination to be for God what you ought to be, and repentance in your life, and a return to the place from which you have departed.
[time=3240] And it is that challenge that I leave with you as we go to prayer tonight, and I'm going to ask you to let the Spirit of God speak to your heart as He hasn't in a long time tonight, and deal with you as a Christian.
[time=3258] How about that matter?
[time=3260] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3266] Every head bowed and every eye closed as we conclude this part of our service tonight.
[time=3274] I want to ask you, Christian, I'm not fooling around, I'm not playing games.
[time=3283] I don't believe God is either.
[time=3285] Where are you?
[time=3288] Are you lukewarm?
[time=3290] Have you lost your first love as did the Christians in Ephesus?
[time=3296] Have you slipped into the routine of your Christian experience and are just existing as a Christian?
[time=3307] God stands outside the door of your heart, and He says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=3315] If you will open your heart's door, I will come in, and I will sup with you and you with me."
[time=3321] That speaks of the fellowship that we can have with Christ.
[time=3325] All how He longs to be a part of your life, an intimate, real part of your being.
[time=3331] And tonight, He asks you to open the door.
[time=3336] Will you let Him be a part of your life?
[time=3338] Oh, I know you're a Christian, you're saved, in essence Christ is in your life, but you've shut Him out of the control room.
[time=3348] And He is so displeased with that.
[time=3352] I wonder how many Christians tonight would say, "Pastor, God has spoken to my life tonight."
[time=3358] That's where I am.
[time=3359] I am a layer to see in Christian.
[time=3361] I know it.
[time=3362] It is not something that I will even argue with God about, I recognize and admit it, and I want you to pray for me tonight.
[time=3370] I'm going to ask that you'll lift your hand, just to lift it up.
[time=3373] Yes, Pastor, that's me.
[time=3375] That's where I am.
[time=3376] You spoke to me tonight.
[time=3377] The Word of God convicted my heart.
[time=3379] I'm a layer to see in Christian.
[time=3381] I don't care if you're a leader, if a Sunday school teacher, you may even be a staff member, but God's spoken to your heart tonight, and you know what He's saying.
[time=3388] And you would be unashamed to say, "Pastor, that's my condition. Would you pray for me?"
[time=3395] Lift it up, will you?
[time=3397] Until I see it.
[time=3399] Do it.
[time=3401] Here's my hand, Pastor.
[time=3402] God bless you.
[time=3405] Someone in the balcony, you would lift your hand.
[time=3409] That's where I am, preacher.
[time=3411] You spoke the truth about me.
[time=3413] Luke Warm is the term. I remember when it wasn't that way, but it's that way tonight. Would you pray for me?
