[time=18] >> From the Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=28] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=74] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=76] And we're so happy that you've joined us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=83] We welcome those of you who have joined us now by television to this very special service which we know is going to be a blessing to each and every one of you.
[time=91] This is the second hour that we've met together here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=96] And it's my privilege to share with you today that our special guest speaker is my good friend, Dr. Tim LaHaye.
[time=102] And he's going to be speaking to us today on the subject, "The Battle for the Mind." It will be a message you'll not forget soon, and one that I hope every one of you will listen to carefully.
[time=112] So after we share together some good music, Dr. LaHaye will come to this pulpit to deliver that very special message.
[time=119] And I hope you'll stay with us through the entire hour as we share together God's truth from His Word on the Bible Hour.
[time=126] [MUSIC - 322 seconds]
[time=453] - I'm so glad that you've joined us in the Bible Hour today
[time=466] and I know that you're going to be blessed and encouraged by a very special message that you'll hear in just a few moments from my good friend, Dr. Tim LaHaye.
[time=473] Message entitled, "The Battle for the Mind." Right now I want to talk to you about your own personal life and how you can be an exciting Christian witness for the Lord Jesus Christ in this day when so many witnesses are needed.
[time=486] I wonder if someone asks you how they could become a Christian, how they could know Christ, if you'd know what to say.
[time=493] There are many good methods that have been made available over the years and good plans of presenting the gospel, but I personally believe the greatest plan that's ever been put together is the plan of the scripture, simply the reading of the Word of God that tells a person how they can come to know Christ.
[time=508] And that's why we're so very excited about this little book called "The Answer Book" because in this book there is an answer for everyone who wants to know Christ.
[time=516] The book has under the subject of salvation all of the pertinent scriptures that deal with how a person comes to know Christ.
[time=524] And if you would be asked by someone how they could know Christ, you could open up this little booklet to the passages listed and printed out here and share with them in detail how they could come to know Jesus Christ in a personal way.
[time=536] And salvation is just one of the many topics that you'll find in the answer book.
[time=539] At the top of each page is a subject, and underneath that subject are the very verses of the Bible that deal with those subjects in a pertinent way.
[time=547] We'd like to send you your free copy of the answer book this week.
[time=550] If you'll just get in touch with us, you may do that in two ways.
[time=554] First of all, and probably simplest of all, is by calling us at the toll free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=562] That number is good any time during the day, night, any part of the week.
[time=567] If you'll just call and ask for the Bible Hour operator, tell her that you'd like to have your free copy of the answer book, and it will be on its way to you in just a few days.
[time=576] Then if you'd like to write to us and share with us some feedback from the Bible Hour Ministry, you can do that by simply enclosing your note in an envelope and addressing it to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=592] When you write or call, I hope you'll take time to also include a request for the daily walk.
[time=599] The daily walk is an exciting plan for you to get into the Word of God every day of your life.
[time=605] Makes it possible for you to read through the Scripture an entire year.
[time=609] Makes it possible for you to understand what you're reading, to comprehend what it says.
[time=614] And I know that the daily walk will be a blessing to you as it has been to countless hundreds of others.
[time=619] And we'd like to send you your first installment of the daily walk, your monthly daily walk guide, and we'll do that if you'll just request it.
[time=627] Once again, in order to request the daily walk, simply call or write us and let us know of your desire.
[time=633] The telephone number is 1-800-45-39,000, and the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=644] We hope that we'll hear from you this week, and we'd just love to send these two very excellent Bible study helps to you to get you started in a more fruitful walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=656] Now I hope you'll stay with us as we turn in a few moments to the Word of God.
[time=660] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Tim LaHaye, and he's speaking to us on the subject, The Battle for the Mind.
[time=667] It may be one of the most important messages you'll hear this year, and I hope you'll listen carefully, take notes, and absorb every single word that Dr. LaHaye shares with us in a few moments.
[time=705] The time was long ago.
[time=717] The people called him Jesus.
[time=725] The crime was the love he showed.
[time=732] And I'm the one to blame.
[time=741] I cost a blame.
[time=748] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=762] He brought me love that only he could give.
[time=781] I brought him cause to cry.
[time=789] And though he taught me how to live,
[time=796] I taught him how to learn.
[time=803] And I'm the one to blame.
[time=811] I cost a blame.
[time=819] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=832] He could have come, he's only father, and said, "Make me away."
[time=843] God, please, take me away.
[time=847] He could have said, "I'm not gonna stay."
[time=854] And I'm not gonna stay.
[time=858] I'm not gonna pray.
[time=865] 'Cause he walked right through the gate,
[time=873] and then on a plane.
[time=881] And as he fell beneath the grave,
[time=888] he cried, "Father, not my will."
[time=895] And I'm the one to blame.
[time=902] I cost a blame.
[time=910] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=925] I'm the one to blame, I cost a blame.
[time=940] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=970] And now it's my privilege to introduce our speaker for today's program.
[time=977] He's Dr. Tim Blahay, the pastor of the Scott Memorial Church in San Diego, California.
[time=982] He's a widely read author, a speaker in family life seminars all over the country, a speaker
[time=988] on a daily radio program that reaches people in every part of the United States.
[time=994] He's my good friend and associate in the Word of God, and he's going to speak to us today on a subject that I know will fascinate each and every one of you because it's a subject that touches your life where you are.
[time=1005] He's going to be giving us a message on the subject, "The Battle for the Mind." You might be interested to know that this message is the substance of a new book that's just been released by Dr. Tim Blahay.
[time=1015] You'll find it in your bookstores, and it will document what you hear in today's service.
[time=1020] So right now I hope you'll help me welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, our good friend, Dr. Tim Blahay.
[time=1038] Thank you, David, and good evening.
[time=1041] It is a distinct pleasure to be back in the Black Hawk Baptist Church, again, where I
[time=1048] think I have so many friends, and it's really exciting to see the growth in this church.
[time=1054] Our association, as the pastor said, has gone back so long that I can appreciate how God's
[time=1061] hand of blessing is on this place.
[time=1065] Would you turn with me in your Bible, please, to 1 Corinthians, chapter 1, where I would
[time=1071] like to share with you the basic message that I would give to all America where I have the
[time=1080] opportunity.
[time=1082] It is called humanism.
[time=1084] It is not a new thing.
[time=1086] It actually goes back to the original days of Babylonish religion, and it found its classification
[time=1094] under the Greeks in the Greek humanistic era, and was written into documents by then.
[time=1101] And later, it almost died out, and then later it was revived in Europe.
[time=1106] And I believe the passage we have addressed to the Church of Corinth is typical of our day because the city of Corinth was typical of Fort Wayne, Indiana, or San Diego, California,
[time=1118] or particularly Washington, D.C., and many other cities around America.
[time=1123] It was a mercantile center, it was a pleasure-loving center, it was a place of giving over to education
[time=1129] and information, even religion.
[time=1131] And remember this, whatever a person believes will characterize what he does.
[time=1138] His behavior is the result of his life's philosophy.
[time=1142] And your philosophy is part and parcel of your religion.
[time=1146] You can call it philosophy if you like, but I don't see how you can separate a philosophy which causes a motive lifestyle and one's religious beliefs.
[time=1156] I'll show it to you tonight that religion or humanism is the most dangerous religion in
[time=1162] the world, and unless we Christians rise up and do something about it, we're going to
[time=1168] lose our culture by abdication.
[time=1171] Let me preface what I'm going to say with this scripture.
[time=1174] In verse 17, Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1, "Christ did not send me to baptize but to
[time=1181] preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ be made to no effect."
[time=1187] I just want to call attention and passing to that expression wisdom of words.
[time=1192] There is a philosophy of wisdom of words that does not say truth, but it sounds very sophisticated.
[time=1199] It sounds like secular humanism, doesn't it?
[time=1202] That's exactly where it came from, it was rampant in Paul's day.
[time=1205] Verse 18, "For the contrast, the message of the cross," and that's a line of reasoning,
[time=1212] it's a religious communication, "the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." The message of the cross then is the power of God to those who believe.
[time=1227] Verse 19, "For it is written I will destroy," now here's the expression, "the wisdom of
[time=1234] this age or the wisdom of the wise," that is humanism, the wisdom of the wise, the intellectuals
[time=1241] from Aristotle, Socrates, Plato and all the humanists of the Greeks and before them, right
[time=1247] up to the present day, modern humanists, it is a wisdom of the wise, the elite understanders,
[time=1254] and he says, "I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent or this earthly wise people." Verse 20, "Where is the wise, where is the scribe, where is the dis-buter of this age, has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
[time=1272] Man's wisdom with God is foolishness." And then he goes on to say, "For since in the wisdom of God," now notice the second wisdom,
[time=1282] "the one is the wisdom of man, the other is the wisdom of God, and I submit to you they
[time=1288] are 180 degrees in opposition, I'll prove it to you in just a moment." He says, "For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, it pleased
[time=1300] God by the foolishness of the message preached to save those who are saved."
[time=1306] The Bible says, and Paul, the spiritual intellectual, said, "Man by wisdom, in the wisdom of God
[time=1314] man by his wisdom will never know God, they carte can go out with his mind into the universe
[time=1320] and he can think and think and think until he turns green and he will never come to the realization of the knowledge of God." Why?
[time=1327] Because that isn't the way you learn about God.
[time=1330] God in his wisdom has chosen that you have to have revelation.
[time=1336] Men innately from himself and within himself will not come to the realization of God.
[time=1340] God's message must be taught, and that's what we're in this world for.
[time=1346] The battle for the mind.
[time=1348] We are teaching, teaching, teaching the message of the cross, and that message communicates
[time=1354] the power of God to salvation to them that believe.
[time=1358] My first diagram is of the incredible brain that God has given to us, that houses are
[time=1365] mine.
[time=1366] The human mind is without a doubt the most incredible living organism.
[time=1372] Scientists tell us that.
[time=1374] Within your brain or within your head you have this brain that is made up of 12 billion brain cells.
[time=1380] So you never have to worry about burning out all your brain cells.
[time=1384] You'll never think so much you burn it up.
[time=1387] Scientists tell us that most of us die with 90 percent of our brain cells unused.
[time=1393] Isn't that a tragic waste?
[time=1396] The brain, according to the Bible, is made up of three unique sections.
[time=1402] You have in your brain your will, your mind, your heart, and that motivates the body.
[time=1409] Our Lord Jesus said we're to love God with all of our heart, with all of our soul, which is the seat of the will, and with all of our mind, and with all of our strength.
[time=1418] Now here's a picture of a person with Christ on the outside.
[time=1422] He's not heard the gospel or at least he hasn't accepted it.
[time=1425] Self is on the throne of his will, and he determines what he's going to do with the very important objects or vehicles to the mind, the eyes, and the ears.
[time=1436] God has given us four receptacles for input to the brain, straight into the brain, through
[time=1442] the eye, and the eargate.
[time=1443] That's why television is so prestigiously important in communicating anything.
[time=1448] It combines the two means, eye and ear, and the Bible talks about that which you've seen with your eyes, and heard with your ears, and have handled.
[time=1458] You see that is another means of communicating, but these are the primary means.
[time=1462] Now this is an unsaved person.
[time=1464] Let's assume that this individual invited Jesus Christ into his life as Lord and Savior,
[time=1470] and that's the only way you can receive him.
[time=1472] By personal invitation he's heard the gospel, it makes sense to him and so he invites Christ in his Lord and Savior.
[time=1478] He becomes the servant.
[time=1479] The S now is no longer self, now the S stands for servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=1485] He is a new creation, Christ has made him a new person by being born again, and this
[time=1491] individual now has a responsibility to let Jesus Christ give surveillance to his eyes
[time=1497] and his ears.
[time=1498] Now this person is still in the battle zone for control of his mind.
[time=1502] Satan doesn't give up on him, and Satan uses every means at his disposal to assault the eyes and the ears to communicate to that mind of his and turn it in the opposite direction
[time=1513] of the truths of God.
[time=1515] Now we have in this world these two lines of reasoning.
[time=1520] At one time the one line of reasoning, what we call Christian consensus that was the concept
[time=1527] upon which America was originally founded, was so dominant that the humanistic concepts
[time=1533] had very little shrift in the way of man or the way of our population.
[time=1538] Because America originally was not founded on humanism as many countries of the world,
[time=1544] America was founded on the revelation of God.
[time=1547] Now don't misunderstand, I'm not trying to suggest that America is a Christian nation
[time=1553] per se, it is not.
[time=1555] America was never founded as a Christian nation and it is not the prophetic fulfillment of the nation of Israel.
[time=1561] But America was founded on more biblical principles than any nation in the history of the world.
[time=1567] That's the reason we have had so many blessings from God because our people had permeating
[time=1573] their minds the principles of God until the last 30 or 40 years when these principles
[time=1580] that come from the Word of God have been supplanted by atheistic secular religious humanism.
[time=1586] It's all the same.
[time=1587] Now humanism is based as I said earlier on the writings of Aristotle, Socrates, Plato,
[time=1593] and the Greek humanists followed by the French skeptics.
[time=1598] Now they didn't come along until about the 16th century and the reason is because Christianity swept through Western Europe in those years and the dominant thought was pretty much Christian
[time=1609] thought until the 12th century when Thomas Aquinas revived Aristotelian writings and the
[time=1616] others and gradually the headwaters of thinking swept through Italy, Southern Europe, and finally
[time=1624] you have the great division of the Reformation.
[time=1628] The enlightenment so called was man's wisdom apart from God's absolute truth and as far
[time=1634] as they have gotten far from the principles of the Bible they have gotten far from morality.
[time=1640] Not only the French skeptics but also the German rationalists and many others and you'll find this kind of thinking produced a whole way of life that is new in our generation
[time=1651] or new in our country and it is destroying America today.
[time=1656] Now when I say humanism the average person looks at me with a blank stare and says well Pastor Lehi what's wrong with humanism and they're thinking of humanitarianism and may I suggest there is absolutely no similarity except the sound.
[time=1671] Humanists are not humanitarian they are human destroyers.
[time=1677] Humanitarians are traditionally Christians.
[time=1680] Christians are the ones that have been the humanitarians in building the orphanages and the hospitals and the colleges and the places to care for the sick and the infirmed and
[time=1690] the helpless.
[time=1692] Humanists when did you ever hear of a humanist building a hospital or an atheist building an orphanage.
[time=1697] Now that's not their style they let us build them and then come in and take them over and let the taxpayers pay for their operation while they assault the mind with their ideology.
[time=1707] Now I'm going to show you in simplified form what a humanist is and I might point out that
[time=1713] I think I have a reasonable recognition of what little gifts God has given me.
[time=1718] I'm not an intellectual I'm not a scholar I'm a pastor who's dedicated to teaching and communicating the word of God but I think I have a gift that's why thirteen of my books are have become best sellers and the other two aren't out yet I hope they'll follow in
[time=1734] the path of the others but I have the gift I believe from God of simplicity now I got
[time=1740] that idea from those who don't like my writings the intellectuals whenever they're asked what do you think about LaHayes writings their comments are usually if they are in Southern California know me they say well he's a nice fella but and then they try to butt it out the window by saying he's so simple well I always think that's a compliment because I write to communicate to the minds of people they can write to the scholars if they like
[time=1764] I'd rather reduce complexity down to terms that people can understand and I have a diagram
[time=1770] here that I'd like to show you which describes and I hope it will burn its way into your mind what the enemy is what he stands for and what harm he is doing to our country there
[time=1783] are five points to a humanist now my apologies to five point Calvinists there are no similarities
[time=1790] except they both have five points for example the Calvinist is a hundred and eighty degrees away from this one atheism all humanists really committed humanists start out on the touchstone
[time=1801] the foundation stone of atheism that strange belief that there is no God now let me show
[time=1808] you on scientific that belief is it is a 17th century concept and it is the formula that
[time=1816] no one plus nothing times blind chance equals everything and if you can accept that abstract
[time=1824] if you're intellectual enough to accept that abstract then you can be an atheist most of us are simple enough to believe that cause and effect are basic and that we are here and
[time=1837] this world is here and you can't have design which is obvious everywhere you look without
[time=1843] a designer but if you have a high enough education and you're intelligent enough you can believe that the design doesn't mean a designer now if you're an atheist the next step came along
[time=1854] about a hundred fifty years later with the advent of Charles Darwin's resurrection of that old Babylonish religious idea of evolution that is that man was not created by God but
[time=1867] that he evolved up through the slime pits and came from the highest form of primate and
[time=1873] of course one of the things that always taxes my mentality about that is it's based on gradual progression minute gradual progression from age to age and then they want us to double
[time=1884] it all in the last big jump because the highest form of urangutan has a brain weight and size
[time=1890] that is about half the size of a human brain weight and so they violate the whole progress
[time=1896] whole concept of gradual progression in that last big jump now the one that I am most concerned
[time=1902] about and that every Christian in America ought to be deeply concerned about is the third rung or point in the humanist ladder and that is our morality it is about seventy five to
[time=1913] a hundred years of age and it is based on these two that is that if there is no God and man
[time=1919] is an animal then there are no absolute standards and therefore men who is an animal ought to be able to satisfy his glands and do anything that his his animal heart desires and these
[time=1930] are some of the things that they communicate since you're anti-moral or amoral they mean
[time=1936] the same there are no absolutes and as one famous sex educator runs around the country saying to children there's no one up there telling you what's right and wrong to do and that you ought to enjoy free love and promiscuity they don't mention that the result is a venereal
[time=1953] disease rampant and the number one social hazard in the lives of young people under twenty four today according to the u_s_ health department now that's the third point let me get to the
[time=1964] fourth autonomous and self-centered that isn't the symbol of human is or the of superman this is the humanist man pictured here as is my terminology for their doctrine of autonomy
[time=1975] independence and the self-centered man they believe that man is so good he's godlike well
[time=1982] that's the fourth one the fifth one is the one that is more nationally dangerous than
[time=1988] any other and that is they have a socialist one world view I don't have time to go into the details of this but I cover it in detail in my book that the humanists are afflicted
[time=1998] with the idea that a man should be separated into three categories that is for the good
[time=2006] use of the natural resources of the earth we should obliterate all nationalities and have just three categories of people it's Plato's old idea resurrected the elite ruling class
[time=2019] the masses and the ever present military and guess who you who do you think the humanists
[time=2025] have selected to be the elite ruling class you're right the humanists they want to rule
[time=2032] over all the rest of us with an enforceable army just like they have in soviet russia now in short that is atheistic humanism now I'm going to show you the other side of reasoning
[time=2044] the wisdom of god and I'll skim over this because you're so indoctrined with this we start with god god is truth god is light and god has revealed himself in his son jesus
[time=2057] and god created man a morally responsible living creature failure to understand this
[time=2065] is failure to give credence to the christian consensus thought now the fourth principle
[time=2072] is that this god created man a morally responsible creature to be his servant and happy is the
[time=2082] man who understands who he is and isn't it interesting we spend billions of dollars I
[time=2088] think last year 140 billions of dollars on secular education and they have to have classes out at state college on identity because the kids are having an identity crisis do you
[time=2099] have an identity crisis you shouldn't have if you're a christian who are you you ought to know who you are I'm a child of god every primary child in the sunday school that's received jesus knows who he is and you say what are you I'm a servant of jesus christ the apostle paul many times distinguished himself by pointing out who he was he understood
[time=2121] who he was and you'll find the individual who has his head oriented toward the things of god has no problem understanding his identity I've counseled thousands of people
[time=2132] and in every case they are people that don't understand who they are they have a problem with their servitude they think other people should serve them instead of they serve you show me a person who is serving other people for the glory of jesus christ and I'll show you a fulfilled person he has his feet on it on the ground he is saying saying and in his right mind a servant of jesus christ is the ideal way to live that's the wisdom
[time=2156] of god and the fifth point is we too have a world view it has two dimensions we have a compassionate world view we look on the world as a harvest field for which christ
[time=2167] died and we look on it as a temporary experience that will pass away and be supplanted with
[time=2174] the life to come now one of the things about the humanists is they have no future view that's why they want to get all the gusto they can get because for them this is it when
[time=2185] a humanist dies he thinks that's it after he's dead he wishes that's all there were to it
[time=2191] but that's another story we understand that and we understand that this world is not our home and the sojourn whether it's seventy or eighty years on this earth spend in servitude
[time=2202] for jesus christ is rewarded in the life to come and happy is the servant who has his eyes lifted on serving jesus christ and that whatever he does in life he does to the glory
[time=2214] of god man's wisdom on the one hand and gods on the other they stand side by side and there
[time=2222] is a gigantic battle for the communication of these two and I want to point out they are
[time=2229] in opposition one hundred eighty degrees in opposition to each other and god predicted
[time=2235] it god said man's ways are not your ways are not my ways and my ways are not your ways
[time=2242] and now I'm going to lay the heavy one on you and the thing that I want you to burn into your mind humanism has sold us a bill of goods in america they have conned us into
[time=2255] the thinking it is a philosophy it is not a philosophy it is a religion and I'm going
[time=2262] to show you that humanism is the most dangerous religion in the world I can give you nine points
[time=2271] to prove it and my dream someday in the next eight next ten years before the eighties are over is that we're able to file a lawsuit that is taken to the supreme court to have
[time=2282] humanism established as a religion and expel from the public school humanism according
[time=2291] to their own statement and I take this out of the humanist bible did you know they have a humanist bible they have an old testament a new testament they call it humanist manifest on one written in 1933 and humanist manifesto to written in 1973 here's what they say about
[time=2306] themselves humanism is a philosophical religion they say it's a religion nine times they know what it is we're the ones that have been asleep we think it's a philosophy humanism is a religious philosophy and moral point of view they should have said our moral point of view as old as
[time=2322] civilization itself it has its roots in classical china grease and Rome they acknowledge it as
[time=2328] a religion let me show you how religious it is every one of these five points is unscientific one
[time=2336] one of the favorite expressions of the humanist is scientific humanism they are committed to calling it scientific humanism why because then people think it's more impressive than it really is if you add the word scientific then you really think it's impressive but I submit to you that you cannot prove one single tenet of humanism you can't prove atheism
[time=2358] you can't prove evolution and you certainly can't prove that our morality is a good lifestyle
[time=2364] and autonomous self-centered people are miserable people I console I spend much of my life counseling
[time=2370] self-centered people and socialism is a scientific disaster nowhere in the history of man can you
[time=2377] find that socialism has ever worked and yet they call their belief science now if it isn't provable
[time=2385] then how is it that they accept it by faith and isn't that what you do in a religion they accept
[time=2391] atheism by faith Thomas Jefferson made it very clear that belief was true whether you believed
[time=2398] in god or disbelieved in god they were both by belief and they believe in evolution you can't
[time=2404] prove it so they have to accept that by faith and I have quotes where some scientists have been at least honest enough to admit that you can't prove evolution you have to accept it by faith and anyone who's going to live a libertine lifestyle as a way of improving himself has to live that lifestyle
[time=2420] by faith and step over the bodies of every prostitute every dope pusher all of the the people that have
[time=2426] suffered because of the the permissive attitudes towards sin and corruption it is not conducive
[time=2433] to a happy lifestyle and selfishness has to be accepted by faith you see the bible that is 180
[time=2441] degrees in opposition to the humanist concept says happiness is the result of knowing god's
[time=2447] principles and doing it the humanist says happiness is result of doing your own thing and no one is
[time=2455] made happy that way they're just made immoral and self-destructive well another thing that has
[time=2463] bothered me is that in the last few years while christianity has been doubling and tripling
[time=2470] our nation has becoming more and more immoral i've been in the ministry for 30 some years
[time=2477] and i have watched churches like black hawk baptist church start from just a handful of people and
[time=2483] grow to become a powerful voice in a community and we have seen this repeatedly until we have
[time=2490] enormous sized churches today preaching and teaching the gospel we are living in a time of holy ghost
[time=2497] sent movement of his spirit i hesitate to call it revival because we are not reviving the moral
[time=2504] culture of our day but we are seeing an enormous increase in the population of christians according to the gallop poll released just a few months ago there are upwards and above 60 million born
[time=2517] again christians in america isn't it exciting more than twice and three times of the number when i
[time=2523] was starting out in the ministry in addition to the born again christians there are many other
[time=2529] religious people that are equally promoralous i'm certain that certain that the catholics have
[time=2536] basically the same moral ideals that we do the jews seventh day adventist the mormons and many others many that are even more strict than some of us in addition to these there are at least 50
[time=2548] million what i call idealistic moralists that's people that have ideals for morals they don't go
[time=2554] to church and they may not live up to their ideals but they sure want their kids to grow up that way they want their children to grow up in a morally sane society now i put this together from other
[time=2564] sources and then was enamored with the idea that when i read that gallop in his great poll
[time=2571] suggests that his results of a scientific survey showed that a whopping 84 percent of the american
[time=2579] people believe the ten commandments were still valid for today think about that 84 percent and
[time=2588] yet we're going away from decency instead of of to it now in addition to these 84 percent
[time=2595] promoralists we have some amoralists and immoralists and who knows only god knows how many
[time=2601] they aren't really too politically active or influential they're just on the course of self destructive destruction their natural age is probably about 32 and they're not as dangerous
[time=2612] as this last group the humanist according to the new york times in 1973 given 10 percent increase
[time=2620] they're only about 275 thousand humanists in america but they are pulling us inexorably toward
[time=2628] depravity by simple terms everyone here who's lived 10 years know that we're closer to depravity
[time=2635] today than we were in 1970 and far further along than we were when i answered the call to the ministry
[time=2641] and we say to ourselves why is this true what has happened i i'd like to show you by reducing
[time=2648] that concept and show you the four vehicles the humanists have used to bring our country to the
[time=2655] verge of depravity they organized all kinds of of organizations and societies from the ethical
[time=2663] culture societies of the 1875s to the american humanist the american civil liberties union
[time=2670] the national educators and so on they control the media they control the two major national
[time=2677] news services that supply the news for the daily newspapers around the country they certainly
[time=2683] control abc cbs and nbc and they control hollywood and have for many years in the many various
[time=2690] magazines and i've already shared with you they got in and control education education was
[time=2696] originally founded by those who are committed to the christian consensus as a means of communicating
[time=2702] the three r's and character building now character building is out and so are the three r's
[time=2708] fun and games are in and we treat our children like their animals because if you reduce them
[time=2714] in skills and intelligence they won't fight they're ready to slip into the masses you know for the military to take over and you see what the humanists have done that many of us have failed to recognize is they moved into government many years ago they just started working on election
[time=2730] after election and getting their people elected to office there are actually four signal
[time=2737] areas of influence in our society the church government education media and organizations i
[time=2747] submit to you that the humanists literally control or predominantly control these four
[time=2754] and if they can they are going to stamp out the church that's why the eighties has been designated
[time=2762] religious rights they are going to destroy the religious rights of the christians let's understand
[time=2768] something folks we are in the midst of a religious battle and the humanists have lulled us to sleep so that the average christian thinks it's the same as it was a few years ago and lehay you're just an alarmist i'm telling you the truth we're in a battle for survival and until we face the fact
[time=2785] that the church of jesus christ is under the humanist gun and these hardcore humanists a minority
[time=2791] in our country control these spheres of influence until they have more power humanly speaking than
[time=2799] we do even though we overwhelmingly outnumber them now we're not completely without our resources
[time=2807] we have a hundred ten thousand bible believing churches many christians schools and colleges and seminaries and all of these other things the problem however is we have abdicated
[time=2817] this area in the green government until the last few years we have been totally ignorant
[time=2825] and devoid of this we have suffered under the same delusion that my godly pastor under whose ministry i was called the preach suffered i remember it as if it were yesterday he said
[time=2836] that politics is a dirty business and that's only true that's only true if dirty people are
[time=2842] in politics remember government is an institution of god and it was meant by god to be a ministry
[time=2850] for good if however it is committed to humanism it is a ministry for bad and i'd like to suggest
[time=2857] that my godly pastor's advice was harmful he said politics is a dirty business we christian
[time=2864] should never get involved in politics we should leave the running of the government over to the nice civic-minded people and we christians build our churches and win souls to christ
[time=2875] well may i suggest those nice civic-minded people have turned out to be atheistic evolutionary anti-moral autonomous self-centered socialist humanists and they are destroying
[time=2889] our culture it is time we christians remember or realize that government is of god and that in
[time=2897] addition to being called to be the light of the world we ought to be the salt of the earth
[time=2903] have you ever thought about the fact that god might want you to run for the school board or the city council or the county supervisors or some other position of leadership in your
[time=2914] community the reason our culture is becoming a moral and sadhman gamora like is because we christians
[time=2922] have abdicated our responsibility we've pulled our righteous robes around us and gone into our
[time=2928] churches and we say titch-titch too bad somebody ought to do something about it and i submit to you
[time=2935] we are the somebody god has entrusted this country into our care and my concern is that instead of
[time=2943] letting it come to sadhman gamora we'll turn it into the great awakening too and continue to be a
[time=2949] launching pad for sending the gospel around the world it's time we realize that we have a
[time=2956] responsibility that is more than strictly spiritual that is social as salt of the earth and there are
[time=2964] plenty of resources that we have things that we can do for example we need to get christians
[time=2971] elected to office who have moral commitment it means that we have to help them get elected to
[time=2977] every conceivable office we've just been through an election and i only got four hours sleep last night because i was so actively involved in a campaign between two christians running for the u_s congress i was pushing one because he is a member of my church and when i left town he was six hundred votes behind but it was so neat for once in my life to be able to go into the voting booth and to choose between two christians and uh... may i suggest we need more not of that kind
[time=3004] of competition but we need more christians running for office as a preacher i think it's worth a few
[time=3010] weeks and months of my time as a private citizen to advance the right moral committed candidates
[time=3016] for office so that then i can entrust the government to their moral commitment and then i can go back to doing the thing that god has called me to do actually what we've got to do is give some moral
[time=3028] minimums to elected officials it is time in america we stop this nonsense of electing people
[time=3034] because they're democrats or republicans and my great great grandfather was a republican or a democrat and elect people not because they have wavy hair or they've gone to such and such a
[time=3045] podunk university or because their standard is this or that or the other thing or their special we ought to have our own special interest morality our culture cannot stand so much
[time=3057] much more anti morality we've got to send to our state houses and our local houses in the u.s.
[time=3064] congress and senate people who have moral minimum commitments we also ought to require that they
[time=3072] have a decency and literature you know it's incredible how anti moral the news medias you know
[time=3078] they've been on a quest recently because one billion dollars last year was spent on religious broadcasting and television and all of these religious people have taken in a billion dollars
[time=3089] isn't that terrible how come they aren't excited about the fact that the pornographers have taken in four billion dollars last year and i submit to you that all that the pornographers have done
[time=3100] has been harmful thousands of people have been one to jesus christ by the use of the television
[time=3107] ministry well fifth uh recognize the dangers of of prostitution and eliminate marijuana and
[time=3114] outlawed drugs and a number of other things what i'm saying is we have got to get back to requiring that our our politicians and those that live off of our tax supported investments uh stand for the
[time=3126] same morals that we do in addition to that we need to start a massive christian school system
[time=3132] that will provide another place of education where they can be protected in the formative years
[time=3138] instead of assaulted in their minds and then we need to to send missionaries into the public school
[time=3144] some of you are working in the public school god bless you but don't be so passive use academic
[time=3150] freedom that the liberals and the humanists keep clubbing clubbing us in education with use it you're an american you're a taxpayer you're a citizen you have rights and if they want the
[time=3160] humanists to have right in our christian schools in order to get accredited to teach humanism
[time=3166] then why can't we christians teach creation and teach recognition of of moral values in the public
[time=3173] schools and then we need to start bible schools or bible studies around the high schools around
[time=3180] them with a place where they in the homes where kids can be brought to to a saving knowledge of jesus christ and then we also need to uh put on long scale or hard uh working evangelism programs
[time=3194] you see what we've got here is a society that does not have the information that you and i had
[time=3200] they do not realize that there is a christian message communicated in the word of god
[time=3207] because they've heard so much about the humanist message over here and the bible tells us
[time=3215] that the wisdom of man is foolishness with god but the wisdom of god is the power of god
[time=3224] unto salvation that's for man let me show you what the issue really is between these two philosophies
[time=3231] the cross of jesus christ the preaching of the cross that the humanists will say oh that's
[time=3238] ridiculous they'll accept jesus as the example they'll accept jesus as the ideal teacher as the
[time=3245] good man as i even read where one of the humanists said he's the ideal humanist he doesn't know jesus that's why he says that they'll say a lot of good things about the lord jesus christ but the one thing they never say anything good about is the cross because the cross
[time=3262] is what separates the religions you see the cross of jesus christ is unique to christianity and it is
[time=3271] the power of god unto salvation to them that believe now let me show you something everyone
[time=3278] in this room believes something to one degree or another we all believe one or the other of these
[time=3284] two concepts neither of them can be scientifically proven they are communicated by revelation of god
[time=3294] it isn't here but it's the revelation of god or the wisdom of man may i ask you as an individual
[time=3302] to which have you committed yourself have you come to that place where you have said the cross upon
[time=3310] which jesus died is a shelter in which we can hide and i personally need my sins cleansed by the
[time=3321] blood of jesus christ if you haven't we'd like to give you an opportunity to do so tonight
[time=3327] let's bow together shall we for a moment of prayer
[time=3334] with our heads bowed and our hearts opened before god would you look into your heart and ask yourself
[time=3341] have i ever really bent my knee to the cross of jesus christ and invited him in as lord and savior
[time=3351] if you haven't won't you do so right now right there where you're bowed for prayer the bible says
[time=3360] whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved would you like to be saved
[time=3367] you can be right there by calling on the name of the lord and i realize in this audience there are many christians some of whom are seeing this concept
[time=3384] of humanism for the first time and you may have been playing games with your life you may have been
[time=3390] satisfying the glands or doing whatever situation requires or doing your own thing and you realize
[time=3401] that you've been heeding the enemy's message not the lord's are you willing to say oh god i want
[time=3409] you to use my mind my eyes my ears my talents to glorify your son
[time=3419] i guess what i'm asking is if you've never really made yourself a servant of jesus christ are you willing to tonight
