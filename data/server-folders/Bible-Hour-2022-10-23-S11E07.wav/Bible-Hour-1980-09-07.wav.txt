[time=0] The Invocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=5] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Charimine.
[time=9] [MUSIC]
[time=35] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=39] We welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=44] This is the second hour worship service and we're grateful to have you here.
[time=48] This is the service that we have opportunity to share with our friends at home by way of television.
[time=54] And so those of you who have joined us now by television, we're grateful for your presence among us as we worship the Lord together.
[time=60] The music of the faith and the preaching of the Word of God is the agenda for this hour.
[time=66] May God richly bless it to each one of you.
[time=70] The people that honor this land sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
[time=84] Amen. [MUSIC]
[time=114] [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=202] At this particular time in our service we are accustomed to sharing the testimony of a special guest.
[time=209] We call them our pulpit guests and I'm very happy to introduce to you today a very special lady.
[time=216] We've read about her and you know about what God has done in her life.
[time=221] Her real name is Maria Anne Hirschman but she is known as Hansi.
[time=227] Will you help me welcome her to our midst today Hansi?
[time=230] [APPLAUSE]
[time=239] Hansi, when it comes to interviewing the guests who come here, I am in a rut and that rut
[time=245] is this that I will never have a guest who I cannot with an absolutely clear conscience ask this question.
[time=252] How did you come to know Christ as your personal savior?
[time=255] I heard about Jesus Christ as a child.
[time=258] I was raised as an orphan by a little peasant woman and she took me in because she loved the Lord Jesus.
[time=264] And I heard about him all my childhood but I did not know and nobody explained to me that you do not become a Christian by training.
[time=272] And when I went to Nazi school at the age of 14, I thought I was a Christian but I had only heard about him.
[time=280] And there was an emptiness in my heart because I didn't know you had to invite him in.
[time=285] And so the Nazis got into that emptiness and took over and was in one year I was a Nazi.
[time=290] And at the end of World War II, I realized that I had followed the wrong cause and the wrong leader.
[time=296] And I went back to the church and to the God of my mother and there was still an emptiness but I do believe I accepted him as my savior and invited him into my heart.
[time=307] But there were two steps in my life.
[time=309] I don't think that I knew Jesus as a reality until I understood that I had to give him my life and make him my Lord.
[time=318] And one night I did that and I said I give it all to you and there wasn't too much to give.
[time=322] After World War II, we Germans call it Caput. I was Caput.
[time=326] I mean, physically, emotionally, mentally, there was just nothing left.
[time=330] I had gone through a communist, labor came, had suffered so much.
[time=334] But I gave him all there was to give even though it wasn't good.
[time=337] And I said, take it over, take my life.
[time=339] And then he became real to me and he has been real ever since.
[time=343] [AMEN] I told you earlier, Hansi, I not only hear it in your voice, I see it in your face and I know it's real.
[time=350] And there are so many other things that have happened since then.
[time=353] I guess I have to say to folks, we don't have time to tell the whole story.
[time=357] But a lot of it's in our books, so you need to get some of those books and read them.
[time=360] But the thing I do want to share with you and I want you to share with our folks is the special burden God has put in your heart for this particular time in your ministry.
[time=368] I have a tremendous burden for America. When the Lord brought me in 1955, I had a lot to learn.
[time=374] I didn't understand freedom, I didn't understand democracy, I didn't know what to do with it.
[time=379] As a matter of fact, I was afraid of it.
[time=381] But freedom after a while grows on you and you fall in love with it.
[time=385] And I fell in love with freedom in this country.
[time=388] And as I grew into the mainstream of the American way of life and became an American citizen, I would like to point out to you that most of you are Americans by birth.
[time=398] But I am an American by my free choice and I am proud of it.
[time=402] [AMEN] And so as I became an American, the Lord laid a burden upon my heart for this land because just the last 10 years or even in the 60s, I saw something happen, then I never dreamed I would see happen in this Christian nation.
[time=417] I am watching every symptom of Nazi Germany raise its ugly head in this country.
[time=422] And I cannot go into telling you what I see.
[time=425] Let me just tell you that I see it, it is real.
[time=427] And I believe America is at the brink of losing everything America stood for just like the land of the Reformation did when Adolf Hitler took over and there were just a handful who took over.
[time=438] And the only reason why they took over in Germany was because the Christians in Germany had forgotten.
[time=443] But the Christians in this country forget we decide where our nation goes.
[time=447] For God said, if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways.
[time=455] And our greatest wickedness is apathy.
[time=458] And if we ever could turn away from that luponness and pray for our nation and say, Lord, what do you want us to do?
[time=464] He said, I will hear from heaven.
[time=466] I will forgive your sins and I will heal your land.
[time=469] And I believe that the Lord wants to heal America more than we want it to be healed.
[time=473] He has done it before.
[time=475] He will do it again if we only do what he said.
[time=478] And this is my ministry. I go out and talk to God's people to come back to him now and do what he said.
[time=485] Hey, man. Hey, man.
[time=487] Hansi, I wish we had a chance to just lay out about a tenfold program for how that can happen.
[time=493] But in a word, what could you say to the American people right now that would help them do their part to make this happen?
[time=500] Remember your history. Several times America has been at that brink and every time there is a prayer revival, a great awakening, it turned around.
[time=509] And if I have one word to say, remember God never changes. We have changed.
[time=513] And God has a certain way and we always begin with prayer.
[time=516] And let me ask you before I leave, how much do you pray for our country?
[time=520] How much do you pray for our leaders?
[time=522] How much do you pray for a prayer revival and a great awakening?
[time=525] Start praying America and ask God what to do and he will show you.
[time=530] And God bless you and God bless America.
[time=533] [AMEN]
[time=555] [MUSIC]
[time=566] I was strongly born in the darkness.
[time=575] There was no satisfaction for me.
[time=584] My life was empty and full of confusion.
[time=593] I was heading for a lost eternity.
[time=602] And a friend introduced me to Jesus.
[time=610] I found through him what my life was meant to be.
[time=620] Not a life without meaning and purpose, but a life to be lived upon to leave.
[time=637] So I asked him to please, please forgive me.
[time=646] Without the sins, I had sinned selflessly.
[time=655] In an instant, he changed my life completely.
[time=664] Now he's living his own life free.
[time=672] It is not I, but Christ, living in me.
[time=681] It is not I, but Christ, the love of his sin.
[time=690] For I'm living my new faith in Jesus.
[time=699] Yes, he's living his own life free.
[time=720] [MUSIC]
[time=729] We're so very grateful to greet you today on the Bible hour and to share with you in this very personal time that is permitted for Donna and me to talk with you about the things that pertain to the Bible hour ministry.
[time=741] Now in case you don't know, Donna is my wife and each week when we sit together in this place during the offering which is being received here in our auditorium, we have the pleasure of communicating with our friends at home about the things that we hope will help to meet their needs beyond the time of the Bible hour.
[time=759] And we have some things we want to talk about with them today, Donna, that I think will be of real encouragement and help to them in their own Christian walk.
[time=767] Communication is a very important part of our lives and I think as Christians we realize that communication with God is an important part of our life.
[time=775] But many times I think we think of communication as a one way street, we think of it as us praying to God as the part of the communication.
[time=784] But there's another part of the communication and that is God talking to us and he talks to us through his word and if we don't spend time in his word then he is not able to communicate to us.
[time=796] And that's why we're excited about a Bible study tool that we have available for you and it's a process of getting you into God's word on a daily basis so that God can have the opportunity of speaking to you and communicating to you what his will is for your life.
[time=812] Donna, that process is called a daily walk because it involves people in a daily study program that gets them into the word every single day.
[time=820] Most people I know have a deep desire to know what the Bible says but they have no plan or program to accomplish that in their own experience.
[time=828] And so they jump and hop and skip from one place to the next in the Bible and then wonder why it doesn't make any sense to them.
[time=835] The thing that we're so excited about is we review what God has given to us as a tool is that the daily walk is a systematic study of the word of God to help you let God talk to your life on a daily basis.
[time=848] The daily walk is a program which takes you through the word of God in a year.
[time=852] If you'll just spend 15 to 20 minutes a day reading the scripture you will be able to read the entire Bible in a year.
[time=858] Not only will you be reading the Bible you'll be reading the commentary that goes along with it practical applications to help you apply to your own life and I promise you that God's word will become meaningful in your life through the daily walk.
[time=870] Now Donna we're just about ready to start a whole new section of the daily walk and there are two places where you can start the old and the new and maybe we should encourage some folks at home to take advantage of this starting place.
[time=883] In a few days we're going to be mailing out the October issue of the daily walk and the October issue begins the study of the New Testament.
[time=891] So this is an ideal time for you to get started on your personal Bible study by beginning in the book of Matthew and having the opportunity to read through consecutively the entire New Testament.
[time=903] Donna I want to encourage our friends to get in touch with us and let us have the privilege of sending a free copy of the daily walk to them.
[time=911] We're trying to make that just as easy as we can because we realize that the many impulses that you have in a given day would cause you to forget about writing to us even as important as studying the Bible might be in your life.
[time=923] So what I'd like for you to do right now is to go to your phone and pick it up and dial this toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=932] And when the operator answers ask her for your free copy of the daily walk. Tell her you've been listening to the Bible hour and you'd like to request your free copy of the daily walk and this week we'll send it out to you absolutely free.
[time=947] And along with it we'll give you instructions so that you know how you can get enrolled in the entire years course of the daily walk.
[time=954] And of course there's another way you can get in touch with us too if you choose.
[time=958] You may write to us and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=970] And you need to remember that communication is not only a two-way process with God it's a two-way process with us also.
[time=976] We communicate with you each week via the media but unless we hear from you in return it's a one-way communication and we don't like that.
[time=985] Donna we have some people who have joined us recently on a new network the National Christian Network and also in a station in the Dayton Springfield area, Channel 26 in Springfield.
[time=994] We're now carrying our program and we're especially interested in hearing from those folks during these days.
[time=999] So if you haven't written to the Bible hour before please sit down and do it today so that we'll know you're a part of the growing Bible hour family.
[time=1007] And then I hope you'll stay tuned as we turn to the scriptures and today to the Old Testament Book of Second Kings for a very special message on this 11th anniversary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1017] Thank you so much for your share in the Word of God as it goes out through the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=1037] There is peace and content meant in my Father's house today.
[time=1057] But the food on his table and no one is turned away.
[time=1066] There is singing and laughter as the hours pass by rush.
[time=1077] Come to singing as the Father sadly cries.
[time=1088] My house is grown but my field is empty.
[time=1098] Who will go and work for me today?
[time=1106] It's since my children all want to stay around my table, but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1125] No one wants to work in my field.
[time=1137] Push away from the table.
[time=1142] Look out through the window pane.
[time=1146] Just beyond the house of plenty.
[time=1151] My field of golden rain and its white unto harvest but the rivers where are they in the house.
[time=1168] Oh, can the children hear the Father sadly say?
[time=1177] Oh, my house is gone but my field is empty.
[time=1188] Who will go and work for me today?
[time=1197] It's since my children all want to stay around my table, but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1217] No one wants to work in my field.
[time=1238] Thank you ladies.
[time=1239] That is a powerful message isn't it?
[time=1241] It's so much fun to be around the Father's table, but there's a great deal of need out there.
[time=1246] And sometimes we can be overfed, overstuffed, over encouraged people while the needs are going unmet.
[time=1254] That's why the opportunity to serve God through evangelism and all of the other things that are here, such a great privilege for us in this church.
[time=1262] This week in many of the homes in this area and to all of the folks who are part of our mailing list, we sent out this schedule of the messages for the next quarter.
[time=1272] And in the months of September and October in the morning services, we're going to be speaking on the subject, loneliness, the disease of the decade.
[time=1280] I don't have to ask you if loneliness ever touches you because it touches everyone.
[time=1286] And if you do not feel it acutely yourself, I promise you you know people who go through it.
[time=1291] And I trust that you'll be in prayer that God will use these messages to encourage and help men and women to find in the midst of their loneliness the Prince of Peace,
[time=1300] who has come to give life everlasting to those who seek Him.
[time=1304] Just before the message this morning, we're going to be reminded in the song of the immutability, the unchanging nature of our God, as we listen to the ministry of star in our world.
[time=1330] [MUSIC]
[time=1343] Life is moving faster than it ever has before.
[time=1350] What tomorrow brings us isn't certain anymore.
[time=1357] Many paths from which to choose don't go which way to run.
[time=1364] 'Cause every road leads nowhere, every road except for one.
[time=1374] He prays the Lord, He never changes, I come to Him, He's always there.
[time=1390] He comforts me on every level, and He takes the burdens that I bear.
[time=1403] He prays the Lord, He never changes, He's never any other way.
[time=1419] And He'll be the same tomorrow as He was and is today.
[time=1438] He says, "Come and go like ashes in the wind, attitudes arise that I don't fully understand.
[time=1451] The things that you can count upon broke your every day, and when that never gets to one, that one will show you the way.
[time=1468] Prays the Lord, He never changes, I come to Him, He's always there.
[time=1484] He comforts me on every level, and He takes the burdens that I bear.
[time=1497] Prays the Lord, He never changes, He's never any, never any other way.
[time=1512] And He'll be the same tomorrow as He was and is.
[time=1523] You know He is today.
[time=1537] Thank you, Starr. It is true that He never changes, and that's a great encouragement to us in these days because change is the name of the game in our present society to know that there is one in whom we trust who changes not is a great encouragement.
[time=1556] I want you to take your Bibles and turn with me this morning to the Book of Second Kings.
[time=1561] Second Kings chapter six. And I'm reading from the Book of Second Kings chapter six, beginning with the eighth verse.
[time=1571] Second Kings chapter six and verse eight.
[time=1577] You'll follow in your Bibles as I read from mine. Second Kings chapter six verse eight.
[time=1584] Then the king of Syria warred against Israel and took counsel with his servants, saying,
[time=1590] "In such and such a place shall be my camp." And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, "Beware that thou pass not such a place, for there the Syrians are come down."
[time=1601] And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice.
[time=1610] Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled for this thing and he called his servants and he said unto them,
[time=1617] "Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?" And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber."
[time=1633] And he said, "Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him."
[time=1639] And it was told him saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan." Therefore sent he, their horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and encompassed the city about.
[time=1650] And when the servant of the man of God was risen early and God forth beholden host encompassed the city, both with horses and chariots and his servant sent unto him, "Alas, my master, what shall we do?"
[time=1661] And he answered, "Fear not, for they who are with us are more than they who are with them."
[time=1668] And Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, I pray thee open his eyes that he may see, and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw,
[time=1677] and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha."
[time=1685] In one of the cities on the East Coast, there was a redevelopment project going on in the center of the city.
[time=1695] In that city was an enterprising young man who for many years had conducted his business in what we would call today a general store facility.
[time=1708] In this store he carried many of the items that people need from day to day.
[time=1715] In the program of redevelopment the city fathers determined that that store would be the only thing that would be allowed to remain.
[time=1724] And so they came in with their bulldozers and excavating equipment and they leveled everything all around this little store.
[time=1732] And in the process of time, in fact within just a very few short months, they came into that same section and butted up right against the sides of that general store.
[time=1745] They constructed some brand new buildings.
[time=1750] On the right-hand side of the building was a huge warehouse-like store that was purchased by a supermarket.
[time=1758] And within a few short weeks that supermarket was in operation selling all of the items that at one time had only been available through the general store.
[time=1768] A few weeks later the occupants of the other side of the store warehouse came in and set up a discount house.
[time=1775] And they offered in that store all of the other items that this poor man had sold through his general store operation.
[time=1783] So there he was with not even any space between him and the other stores.
[time=1787] And on one side was a supermarket and on the other side was a discount house and he had an impossible situation.
[time=1794] You know what he did? Oh I like this.
[time=1798] He went to a sign painter and he painted a beautifully big sign and he brought it and installed it over the entrance to his store.
[time=1807] And this is what the sign said. Main entrance.
[time=1815] Isn't that good?
[time=1818] When I read that story I was reminded of the tremendous excitement there is in a philosophy like that that looks at the impossibilities and turns the impossibilities into an opportunity.
[time=1835] I believe with all my heart that how we deal with the impossibilities in our lives determines a great deal of the direction and the fiber and the joy and the excitement of what we know personally as Christians and as individuals.
[time=1850] The story that I read for you this morning or at least the portion of it is the story of an impossible situation.
[time=1858] Now the background of this particular section of the scripture is this. The king of Syria was at war with the king of Israel.
[time=1868] Whenever he would set up an encampment to do battle with the Israelites he discovered to his amazement that the Israelites seemed to know about it all of a sudden they seemed to know about it ahead of time.
[time=1880] And so as we've read this morning one day he called his generals his servants together and he said I want to know which one of us is for the king of Israel.
[time=1888] In plain language that means which one of you is telling the story which one of you is telling the military secrets of the Syrian army.
[time=1896] And one of the servants answered in the most amusing statement he said it's not us but that prophet over in Israel that guy Elisha he's telling the king of Israel the things that you're saying in your bedroom.
[time=1909] Now that's what it says in the text.
[time=1912] In other words this prophet is getting from the Lord all of the advanced strategy of the Syrian army and he's just passing it right on to the king of Israel.
[time=1923] Well the Syrian king realized that he had a chore to take care of and so he got his troops together and we pick up the story where he has decided that he's going to Dothan where Elisha is and he's going to take him captive.
[time=1936] Bring him back and do away with the leak of information that is in a very strange way coming through the prophet of Israel miles away.
[time=1948] And in the sixth chapter of the book of 2 Kings we read about the encampment against Elisha and his servant.
[time=1954] Now the servant of Elisha was no doubt a replacement for a man by the name of Gahai's eye who had been Elisha's servant up until this time.
[time=1961] We do not know his name but we do know his reaction to the situation he faced in his own life.
[time=1969] We read in verse 15 that when he got up one morning and went out to check the surroundings as apparently was his custom.
[time=1980] Behold and host compass the city both with horses and chariots.
[time=1986] And he came back into his master Elisha and he said what all of us say in the midst of impossibilities.
[time=1993] Elisha what shall we do?
[time=1999] Immediately in that statement we have a clue to how we respond in problems.
[time=2004] For it is obvious from the record in the book that Elisha would not have been troubled by that for this simple reason.
[time=2011] If he was capable in the hand of an almighty God of understanding the secrets of a Syrian king miles away
[time=2019] I am certain that he would not have been overwhelmed had he gone to his window in the morning and seen the host encamp about him.
[time=2025] He was in touch with the power of God he would not have been worried about it.
[time=2029] But the servant did what all of us do.
[time=2032] He tried to include somebody else in his problems and he said what shall we do?
[time=2039] What is this we business?
[time=2044] What are we going to do?
[time=2047] That's a very contemporary question isn't it?
[time=2051] I hear it a lot.
[time=2053] I ask it a lot.
[time=2055] What are we going to do?
[time=2058] That seems to be the normal vernacular when we get into situations that are overwhelming to us and we don't know how to respond to them.
[time=2065] And I would be very surprised if here in the auditorium this morning and certainly in the homes where this television program is seen
[time=2072] there aren't a whole host of people who at this very moment in time are saying what am I going to do?
[time=2082] It may be that you have a son or a daughter who is wayward and you've given the best years of your life to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and they have responded to it in no fashion whatsoever and they're walking away from God and in sin and you throw up your hands and say what am I going to do?
[time=2099] It may be that your mate has left.
[time=2102] Decided that they don't want to live with you anymore.
[time=2107] You don't know why or how it happened.
[time=2109] All you know is it seems like an impossible situation and you say what am I going to do?
[time=2118] You have an impossible situation where you work.
[time=2122] Hardly a week goes by that I don't hear that from someone.
[time=2125] Pastor you don't know what it's like where I work.
[time=2127] It's impossible!
[time=2128] What am I going to do?
[time=2130] May I remind you this morning at the outset of this message of four very key scriptures that I hope you'll write in the front of your Bible for this impossible age in which we live.
[time=2143] Two of them from the Book of Jeremiah, two of them from the Book of Luke that ought to be emblazoned upon our hearts because we live in impossible times.
[time=2152] In Jeremiah the 32nd chapter in verse 17 we read these words, "Our Lord God, behold thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm."
[time=2165] Listen now, nothing is too difficult for thee, Jeremiah 32 17.
[time=2173] And in the same chapter of that great book in verse 27 we read these words, "Behold I am the Lord, the God of all flesh is anything too difficult for me."
[time=2185] That is a rhetorical question that expects this response, absolutely not.
[time=2191] And then you hit your biblical wagon from Jeremiah to Luke and you come in the Book of Luke to the exact same phrase.
[time=2199] Luke chapter 1 verse 37, "For nothing is impossible with God."
[time=2207] And in Luke 18, 27 we read these words, "The things impossible with men are possible with God."
[time=2217] Men and women in the midst of the difficult situations, if there's any message for any of us who are in the Christian family, it's this.
[time=2225] That when it is difficult for us, when it is impossible for us, it has not yet touched the hem of the garment of an Almighty God who sees no impossibilities whatsoever.
[time=2237] As we were growing up in our youth groups we used to sing, "God any rivers you think are uncrossable, God any mountains you can't tunnel through, God specializes in things thought impossible, and he'll do for you what no other one can do."
[time=2257] The impossible situation. When the servant of Elisha looked at the hosts all around him and he compared that to what he saw in himself and his master, his response was, "There's no hope. It's impossible. What shall we do?"
[time=2277] Point number one, the impossible situation. I have discovered that most of the time the impossible situation gives way to the second step in this story. And you know what that is? The inaccurate assessment.
[time=2301] I'll ask my master, "What shall we do?" He had already made up his mind that there was no hope. There is nothing we can do to change this situation. His question is a question of despair and despondency. It is all over. We're done. We're finished. What can we do?
[time=2320] Someone has remarked that carnal eyes can never see God's way of deliverance, and certainly the Scripture would bear that out when it teaches us that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are spiritually discerned. God's way was present already in the experience of this servant, but he did not have the eyes to see it.
[time=2343] I don't know if you're like me, but we all are bound together in the commonality of human flesh, and I would expect that many of you will identify with this, that when faced with big problems in our lives, we usually respond in two ways. First of all, we jump to conclusions.
[time=2367] That's a dangerous jump for us to take. I read this week that in Detroit, Michigan, in an automobile manufacturing office, this letter is on file.
[time=2383] Dear sirs, I have one of your cars, and I have a complaint about it. My complaint is that the car runs fine until I go out and buy vanilla ice cream.
[time=2393] I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm serious. I buy my family ice cream every night, and if I buy strawberry ice cream, or if I buy chocolate or not ice cream, my car starts fine.
[time=2404] But when I buy vanilla ice cream, the thing won't start.
[time=2410] The top echelon in the automobile manufacturer said, you know, with this file, this one in the file, you know, this guy's flipped out, and someone said, no, let's don't do that, let's check it out.
[time=2421] And so they sent an ambassador to that man's town. He got a motel room near the man's house. He went to meet the man he discovered. He was a college graduate.
[time=2430] He was a very intelligent man. He had all of the degrees and the class to go with it. He was well respected in his community. There was not a flaky thing about him.
[time=2439] He couldn't figure it out, and so he decided to follow him around in his rounds to the ice cream store. And sure enough, that night they went to the ice cream store.
[time=2448] He went in and bought strawberry ice cream, came out and the car started fine. The next night he bought vanilla and the car wouldn't start.
[time=2462] And then he began to study what was happening. In this particular ice cream shop, while the vanilla ice cream was right at the entrance door, the flavored ice cream was at the rear of the store.
[time=2475] And whenever you went in to buy flavored ice cream, there was always a long line waiting in line to get the ice cream. The vanilla line was usually short.
[time=2483] When he bought vanilla ice cream, he would go in and buy it, and in just a matter of a few minutes, he'd be back in his car and on his way home.
[time=2489] When he bought strawberry ice cream, it took approximately 10 to 12 minutes. His car had a vapor lock problem.
[time=2497] And within a short period of time, it didn't develop, but over a longer period of time it developed. And his analysis of that was that vanilla ice cream causes my car not to start.
[time=2512] He jumped to a conclusion without examining the evidence.
[time=2519] We laugh at the absurdity of that story only because in many ways, and on many days, we have done the same.
[time=2526] The second thing we do when confronted with problems is not only to jump to conclusions, but to expect the worst.
[time=2536] Don't we? We assume the very worst. Someone asked a friend, "Are you a pessimist or an optimist?" He said, "Well, I'm an optimist, but I've discovered that the pessimists are better informed."
[time=2550] And he was right. We always think the very worst of our circumstances. Let me give you an illustration with which some of you will identify.
[time=2564] You go to the doctor for a routine examination. He tells you you have an unexplained growth on your body.
[time=2574] What comes to your mind? It's cancer. I guess as it relates to that particular situation, that's the worst thing that could happen.
[time=2584] We all think that way, but there are many, many options to that given that set of circumstances.
[time=2590] I don't know why we're prone to do it, but we all are. And that's what this servant did. He looked at the circumstances around him and he said, "The worst is going to happen. We'll be done in. What shall we do?"
[time=2603] I don't want this to be so practical that it's not spiritual, but let me say that one of the things we need to learn, and we can learn it if we're determined to do it,
[time=2611] is that in the midst of insurmountable odds, we need to take a step back and ask God to give us a clear-headed perspective so that we can at least define what the problem is.
[time=2622] So much of our problem in life is related to the fact that we react to something other than the real situation, and that just creates a whole snowballing effect for the rest of our lives.
[time=2637] The impossible situation and the inaccurate assessment is followed in this story by the invisible realities. Notice, verse 16, "When the servant came back with his report that was filled with anxiety, Elisha said, "Fear not, for they who are with us are more than they who are with them."
[time=2666] I'd like to imagine what the servant did. He ran back out again and he looked and he came back in and he went, "One, two. What are you talking about, Elisha? There's only two of us, and look at the host out there."
[time=2690] Here is a study in contrast of one man who saw through the eyes of the flesh and another man who saw through the eyes of faith.
[time=2704] When we see through the eyes of the flesh, we will see only what the human eye can assess, but the Bible teaches us and it is multiplied in passages over and over and over again that faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
[time=2722] And in 2 Corinthians 5, we're told that we walk by faith and not by sight. And 2 Corinthians 4 says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[time=2741] Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. If God before us, who can be against us? But that grabs hold of the unseen realities.
[time=2751] Elisha saw that God's provision for that problem had already been supplied. He believed that God had made it happen. This servant only saw the problems.
[time=2764] The greatest temptation for all of us when we are confronted with the problems of our lives is to hold those problems so close to us that it blots out the view of the answer God has already provided in the midst of the situation.
[time=2780] Someone has reasoned from the secular viewpoint that the seed of the answer is always in the midst of the problem.
[time=2791] And if we will just review in our mind's eye for a moment some of the problems which we have dealt with in our own lives, we would be honest in assessing that most of the time, the answer to the problem has been there all the time, we just didn't see it.
[time=2805] It had not been revealed to it. We didn't understand it. We couldn't see it with our eyes.
[time=2815] These realities that Elisha saw he did not create. Sometimes when people talk about faith, you get the impression that faith only makes things happen. That's not true.
[time=2826] Faith sees what has happened. Faith sees beyond the problem to the reality of God's provision and Elisha just saw what God had already provided. He saw it in the midst of his situation.
[time=2840] I had no sooner return from vacation than my phone rang one day and someone from out of state told me that they were having difficulty in their home.
[time=2853] And then he made this statement to me, "I shall never forget it." He said, "But I'm not giving up because I believe what the Word of God says, that love abides forever, and the love that was in that relationship when it started is somewhere still there.
[time=2868] I am determined to discover it and renew it and recreate it that this relationship might be restored."
[time=2876] How different from the average person today who with a flippant comment simply says, "But I don't love her anymore and goes off to find greener pasture."
[time=2886] My friend, if you loved her in the first place, the love that was there when you started is there somewhere.
[time=2894] You need to ask God to help you see it and then to cultivate it and make it happen.
[time=2901] The unseen realities.
[time=2906] Last but not least, I want you to notice the illuminated realities.
[time=2911] In a moment of time, the man who could not see was caused to see, and it's interesting to notice how the process transpired.
[time=2921] He did not get his new vision by a clinic in faith.
[time=2926] There was no catechism, no discussion, no doctrinal input.
[time=2930] He didn't take him aside in a seminar and teach him how to believe great things from God.
[time=2934] No, the scripture says, "He prayed. Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes."
[time=2943] Help him to see with the eyes of faith, that which I see.
[time=2948] I was convicted when I saw this because in this computer age in which we live, in the how to do it society,
[time=2955] we are so prone always to be ready with the easy answer to everybody's problem.
[time=2960] Someone comes and says, "Pastor, I've got this problem." Well, let me tell you five things to do and it will be solved.
[time=2968] No, that's not what happened.
[time=2970] The problem was a problem of spiritual perspective and Elisha said, "Oh God, open this man's eyes."
[time=2977] When was the last time a friend of yours in trouble in his home or in trouble in his life came to you with problems
[time=2983] and instead of giving him the easy pat answers, you knelt with him on your knees and prayed, "Oh God, give this man divine perspective.
[time=2991] Open his eyes that he may see it from your perspective." It was intercession, not education, that caused the change.
[time=3003] I'm reminded of what Paul wrote to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 when he wrote, "But as it is written, I have not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God have revealed unto him unto us by his spirit."
[time=3020] God is willing and ready to give us his perspective if we'll ask for it, not just for us but for others.
[time=3026] And we notice in the story that the opening of his eyes was the silencing of his fears.
[time=3033] When he saw, he no longer was afraid.
[time=3038] As we read through the conclusion of the story, we discover that with one breath, Elisha prayed down sight for his servant and blindness for his enemies.
[time=3055] For the Scripture says in verse 15, that when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host,
[time=3062] compass the city both with horses and chariots, and the servant said unto him, "What shall we do?" And 17, Elisha prayed and said, "Open his eyes." And in 18, when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said, "Smite this people with blindness."
[time=3077] And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha, and the rest of the story is an interesting and intricate illustration of God's provision
[time=3084] for Elisha and his servant in that problem.
[time=3088] Prayer was the answer.
[time=3090] Prayer for perspective.
[time=3092] May I remind you that in this story, the answer was there all the time.
[time=3102] We have a chorus there, a song that is sung here on occasion.
[time=3105] He was there all the time.
[time=3107] We're looking around in all different places for the answer, and he's always been there.
[time=3112] He's waiting for us to come to him with our problem and present it to him.
[time=3116] Instead, we run off in every direction trying to find the answer in the things of the world, and he's always there waiting
[time=3122] till we work out all of our options and run out of all of our time and our determination to do it ourselves.
[time=3128] And finally, we come back and discover that he was there all the time.
[time=3132] I remember the story in the New Testament of the disciples out on the sea.
[time=3137] Rowing in the midst of the storm, and it was tearing their boat apart, and up on the mountain was the Savior praying.
[time=3144] Praying for his disciples in the midst of that experience.
[time=3147] He could have instantly ended it, but he did not.
[time=3150] He allowed them the experience of the problem so that he might teach them the lesson of faith.
[time=3155] But he was there all the time.
[time=3157] He was in control.
[time=3159] Never for a moment were those disciples out of his almighty vision.
[time=3163] And he let it go just as long as he deemed necessary.
[time=3167] You say, "Pastor, what does this have to do with the state of the church?
[time=3179] May I say so very quickly and in conclusion that the impossibilities which we have felt in the past as God has put his hand upon us
[time=3189] to do things for him are as child's play in light of the impossibility of the present task he's called us together to assume."
[time=3199] The Arlington Project, the Family Life Center and all of that that's going on over there, the needs that we have are impossible.
[time=3209] I suppose for the first time as I got away on my vacation away from here and away from the situation
[time=3215] and could get the perspective of distance, it became very much aware to me, I became very aware of the fact that what we're doing is not possible.
[time=3224] It is impossible.
[time=3226] Before I left, I communicated with all of you that in order for us to break ground in the fall, an amount of $500,000 would be necessary.
[time=3240] I said that with faith and with the prayer, "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief."
[time=3247] I went away on vacation and prayed every day, "Lord, I don't know where that money is going to come from, but identify some source of that money so that we can get this project going."
[time=3257] In the process, I found great temptation within my soul to give it all up and to run from it and not to face it because of the impossibility of it all.
[time=3267] One day in my prayer, I said, "Lord, I want an answer. Help me to know what you're going to do to supply this need."
[time=3275] I called home.
[time=3277] I talked to our business manager who had just been to the opening of the bids for the foundation project which we had estimated by our architect would cost between $400,000 and $500,000.
[time=3290] He said, "I have good news, Pastor." There were 14 firms that bid on that project. The high bid was $190,000, the low bid was $120,000, and the low bid was by the firm we would have chosen could we choose without money being a factor.
[time=3309] Suddenly dawned on me that God had this all in control, and while I was praying for more money, he created a work hunger and caused the bid to go down.
[time=3323] Why do we try to stereotype him in our problems? Lord, here's my problem, and we want it solved this way. One, two, three, four in that order, and when that happens, I'll know.
[time=3336] If God has a sense of humor, he certainly must laugh at our anxiety while he's working it all out in a totally different way to supply the need of each of our lives.
[time=3349] Does that work for you? Is God in control of your life as he is in control of the life of this church? Yes, he is.
[time=3359] He's got your problem right in the palm of his hands. If you will open your eyes of faith, the answer is present. Shall we pray?
[time=3371] Father in Heaven, we pray that the adventure through which we are going right now as a congregation will be a time of teaching for each of us as we trust you to resolve the difficulties we can only assess.
