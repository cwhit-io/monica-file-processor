[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We present the
[time=25] Bible Hour with Pastor David Geramond.
[time=55] We're so very happy to welcome you to our service today. We thank you for being here.
[time=79] Those of you who have joined us in the auditorium for the second hour of worship. And of course, many who have joined us at home by television. And we're praying that this will be a time of blessing and encouragement and help for all of us as we open the Word of God together
[time=93] in a few moments. Today, we begin a new series of messages on the theme, "Loneliness, the
[time=99] Disease of the Decade." I am certain that all of us in some way or another will identify
[time=105] with this particular subject either very much so personally or because of people that we
[time=111] know and love. Let's be in prayer in the early part of this service that God will minister to our hearts through His Holy Word.
[time=146] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=308] That is a good, a good song of testimony for all of us about whom that is true. I hope today
[time=316] you're a child of the King. As a young man who came to this church some weeks ago and got his life
[time=324] straightened out with the Lord and began to walk with the Lord and serve the Lord, became interested
[time=330] in our television ministry and ultimately became one of our cameramen. His name is Jerry Schlotter.
[time=336] This past week Jerry and some friends of his went to West Virginia and while in West Virginia
[time=342] on a white water raft trip he was crossing a bridge, a one-way bridge when a car came and
[time=349] he fell off of that bridge into a gorge and was killed. His family come here to church,
[time=358] his grandparents know of the ministry we have had in his life and we just want to extend to
[time=366] them and to all who knew and loved Jerry our deepest sympathy at this time and also thanksgiving
[time=372] to him for the part he's played in a ministry that touches the lives of many thousands of people.
[time=377] We do not know the circumstances of his funeral and the services. We will pass that on to our own church family this evening. Please be in prayer for his wife. His daughter is a student in our school for her, for those who know and love him. It is good to know that in a time like this
[time=392] the Lord Jesus cares. He cares about us and our need. Hope you'll listen carefully to the ministry of the Peterson's.
[time=416] He cares when you're troubled and the whole world seems wrong. He cares when the trials
[time=433] try to silence your song. He cares when you're lonely, though you love with the throne. Jesus cares.
[time=459] Jesus cares. He cares when you're heartless.
[time=476] He cares when you stumble in the heat of the day.
[time=504] He cares when you're burdened and too weary to pray. Oh, and he cares when you fail him,
[time=517] when your feet go astray. Jesus cares.
[time=532] Jesus cares. He cares when you're heartless.
[time=569] He cares when you're hurt. Jesus cares.
[time=582] Jesus cares.
[time=600] We're so very grateful that you've joined us on the Bible Hour today. My wife Don and I look forward to this opportunity of sharing with you at home as we interrupt our service here to just take a moment personally with you right there in your living room. Don, I don't think
[time=616] there's ever been a time in my life when I have been so aware of the tremendous intensity of
[time=622] need in the lives of people. I suppose it may be because of the research and study that has already
[time=628] been done in preparation for our messages on loneliness, but it seems like everywhere we look, we see people who are hurting, who have needs, and if the male we get in the Bible Hour office is any
[time=639] indication of that, that is a reality more than just my guess. I suppose that's the reason why I'm so
[time=645] very excited that as a Christian and as a gospel minister, we have something to put in the hands of
[time=651] people that makes a difference beyond just the human opinions of individuals who are always so
[time=658] willing to give their opinion about any given problem. And I hope that today we can encourage a number
[time=664] of our friends at home to get involved with that resource that can really be of help to them. Unfortunately,
[time=670] when you depend upon human answers and resources, you many times get different answers from different
[time=677] people and sometimes different answers from the same person depending on when you ask them. We change,
[time=683] but we do have a source that is unchanging and that's the word of God. And God has the answers
[time=689] for our problems that we are facing today just as he had the answers hundreds of years ago for people
[time=695] with their problems. God does not change and the answer to our problems does not change if we get it
[time=701] from him. But in order to get the answers, we have to be in his word. And that's why we would like to
[time=707] encourage you to join us in reading The Daily Walk. And The Daily Walk is a scripture guide that if you
[time=715] start in October, you would start reading in the beginning of the New Testament and if you continued for one year, you would read through the entire scriptures in one year. And this is the way that you
[time=726] can find the answers to the problems that you're facing in your life is by a daily experience with the
[time=732] Lord in his word. And we would like to send you a free copy of The Daily Walk. And to obtain your free
[time=738] copy, all you need to do is call us at our toll-free number 1-800-453-9000. Just ask for the Bible
[time=748] Hour operator and tell her that you would like to receive your free copy of The Daily Walk. That
[time=754] number again is 1-800-453-9000. It's a toll-free number and you may call it at any time during the
[time=761] week and just ask for the Bible Hour office.
[time=764] Don, I'd like to encourage our friends that there's an intermediate goal on the way to reading the whole Bible. And that is that if they start in October reading with us in the New Testament, by the end of this year, by the end of December, they will have read the entire New Testament. And of course, there's so much help there for all of us as we live in this world today. We would like to encourage you to get
[time=785] involved in God's Word. We preach from the Bible every Sunday. Today I'll be opening the scriptures in a few
[time=791] minutes to share with you the first message in this series on the subject of loneliness.
[time=796] But what I say in just a few moments we have on this telecast is really not sufficient to meet the
[time=802] day-by-day needs that you have and you need to get involved in personal Bible study. So many people write and say, "But I don't know how." And we'd like to help you know how by putting in your hands
[time=813] this special Bible study tool that will get you into the Word of God every day. Once again, for your free copy of The Daily Walk, simply pick up your phone and call this toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000. And when you call, we'll be happy to send you the October issue of The Daily Walk.
[time=831] And of course, you can write to us, as Donna has said, by simply addressing your letter to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. Many of you have joined us just
[time=843] very recently on the new National Christian Network across the United States. We're especially anxious to hear from you in these early days of our new broadcast on this network of stations.
[time=853] And for those of you who are listening on the station in the Dayton Springfield area, Channel 26, we'd like to hear from you as well. Right to us this week, we count on hearing from you as we try to
[time=864] evaluate the ministry God has given us on the Bible Hour.
[time=894] And we're just here to hear from you as we are.
[time=937] You may take away my earthly treasure on the wealth that I may own.
[time=950] And the joy that comes with earthly pleasure could not compare to Jesus Christ my Lord.
[time=967] Take away my friends and loved ones from me.
[time=975] Take the ones I hold so dear.
[time=981] They all forsake my soul and leave me lonely.
[time=989] My hopes in Christ I'll have no fear.
[time=1000] All I need I come in Jesus, he has been.
[time=1021] He's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been forever.
[time=1041] All I need I come in Jesus, he has been.
[time=1070] He's been, he's been, he's been, he's been forever.
[time=1089] All I need I come in Jesus, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been.
[time=1116] He's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been forever.
[time=1136] And let's respond to that in faith shall we by singing Christ is all I need.
[time=1141] Just together as a chorus as we sing together Christ is all I need.
[time=1148] Christ is all I need, Christ is all I need.
[time=1187] And now let us take our Bibles and turn together to the book of Psalms.
[time=1192] During these next several weeks in this series of messages we will be coming to the Psalms often.
[time=1199] For the Psalms give to us the writings of a man who experienced the emotion about which we speak.
[time=1208] Psalm 142, though it is a short psalm, speaks to all of us where we are when we experience the pain of loneliness.
[time=1220] It is a psalm of David written while he was a refugee.
[time=1225] And this is what it says, "I cried unto the Lord with my voice.
[time=1230] With my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication?
[time=1234] I poured out my complaint before him, I showed before him my trouble.
[time=1238] When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path, and the way wherein I walked have they secretly laid a snare for me.
[time=1247] I looked on my right hand and beheld, and there was no man that would know me.
[time=1253] Refuge failed me.
[time=1255] No man cared for my soul.
[time=1258] I cried unto the O Lord.
[time=1260] I said, "Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
[time=1264] Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low.
[time=1267] Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
[time=1271] Bring my soul out of prison that I may praise thy name.
[time=1275] The righteous shall compass me about, for thou shalt deal bountifully with me."
[time=1281] We begin seven messages today on the subject, "Loneliness, the Disease of the Decade."
[time=1290] In the next weeks after today's message, we will be studying a passage of Scripture
[time=1296] in its entirety that deals with this problem.
[time=1300] And today we will survey the Scriptures as we talk together about the subject,
[time=1307] Lonely Saints, shall we pray.
[time=1311] O Father in Heaven, we admit and confess that we have no human word
[time=1320] for the present malady of loneliness that touches so many people.
[time=1325] We see how the world tries to deal with it, and we see its failure.
[time=1330] O God, in the absence of a human word, there is a word from on high, a word from the God who created us and knows intimately the emotion and experience that is ours.
[time=1341] And from that God comes the answer, and to that God we look.
[time=1346] As we begin this study today, in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1354] "Loneliness, the Disease of the Decade." Too strong, you say?
[time=1363] Well, listen to this.
[time=1365] Fourth of the people who were questioned recently in one survey that was taken felt very lonely or cut off from other people at one time in recent days.
[time=1378] In another study, there were 27% of the unmarried women and 10% of the married women, 23% of the unmarried men and 10% of the married men
[time=1389] who expressed intense loneliness in their lives.
[time=1393] Almost half of the widows over 50 said that loneliness was their worst problem.
[time=1398] Loneliest of all, according to the research, was the elderly man who lived alone and was in firm.
[time=1407] All was taken some weeks ago in Washington, D.C., which proved the point when 60% of the people who were questioned right on the street said that they were lonely some of the time.
[time=1419] James Lynch, in an interview in the magazine People, was asked how close the connection was between loneliness and health.
[time=1429] And he answered with these interesting words.
[time=1432] That's like asking what is the connection between heir and one's health?
[time=1437] Like the heir we breathe, human companionship is taken for granted until we're deprived of it.
[time=1445] The fact is that social isolation, the sudden loss of love and chronic loneliness
[time=1451] is significant in a contribution to illness and even to premature death.
[time=1457] Loneliness is not only pushing our culture to its breaking point, said Lynch, it is pushing physical health to the breaking point.
[time=1466] He backed it up with these statistics.
[time=1469] He said that the coronary death rate among widows between 25 and 34 is more than five times that for married women.
[time=1478] The death rate for bachelor's is 75% higher than that for married men.
[time=1483] And for divorced men, the death rate is more than double.
[time=1488] Loneliness and isolation from others does take a tremendous toll in the lives of people today.
[time=1496] Now before we go any further, I suppose it would be a good idea for us to define what it is.
[time=1502] I have to honestly say that defining it is not possible describing it maybe.
[time=1508] Some have described it in physical terms as an empty feeling in the pit of their stomach, almost to the point of nausea.
[time=1517] An underlying anxiety, say others.
[time=1521] Some say it is a sharp ache in moments of grief or separation.
[time=1525] For others it's a long period of stress that tears away and wears them down
[time=1531] till they are discouraged and defeated.
[time=1536] Clark Mustuckus, who has written more definitively on this subject than anyone I have read,
[time=1542] described it descriptively when he said it is as an inner scream.
[time=1549] A disconnectedness from the world, from people, from life in general.
[time=1555] Gene Paul Sart describes it this way.
[time=1558] He wrote, "We are isolated from others, from the past and from the future, from meaning and from value.
[time=1564] We can count on nobody but ourselves because we are alone.
[time=1568] We are abandoned on earth and without help.
[time=1571] Life is absurd and love is impossible.
[time=1575] So we are condemned to futility and an impersonal world and in a universe with neither heart nor meaning.
[time=1583] I am sure that he speaks for many a lonely person when he writes those words.
[time=1590] The Swiss psychiatrist Paul Tournier called loneliness the most devastating malady of this age.
[time=1599] Men and women, there is no anguish like the anguish of loneliness.
[time=1605] I read it in the letters that come to my desk from the prisoners who watch our telecast behind bars.
[time=1614] I hear it in the voice of a woman who calls me on the phone to tell me that her husband has left or he is leaving.
[time=1624] I feel it in the handshake of the person who meets me at the door having been transferred to our church from a far distant city
[time=1632] where he was a part of a small and meaningful fellowship of people with whom he had grown up all of his life
[time=1640] and who were his intimate friends and he is thrust into a growing and larger church where he knows no one and feels close to nobody.
[time=1651] I watch it in the face of the husband who has just buried his wife.
[time=1658] I see it in the face of the wife who has just bid farewell to her husband of many years at the graveside.
[time=1666] I ache with its effects as I hug grandparents and parents in the funeral home,
[time=1672] realize the body of a beautiful young girl who was snatched from their presence
[time=1679] in a few hours of a violent, unexplainable disease.
[time=1686] I observe the seeming cruelty of it in the faces of many single people I know who are trying to find community and fellowship in a religious and social world that is very much family-oriented and couple-centered.
[time=1703] I imagine the pain of going home to an empty apartment after work to prepare a meal for one
[time=1715] and then to watch television until the body is too tired to feel the pain of being alone.
[time=1722] I listen to the early voice of loneliness as my children speak from time to time and say,
[time=1732] "Daddy, I don't have anybody to play with." Or, "Those guys won't let me play." Or, "I don't think anybody likes me."
[time=1748] I observe it in teenagers who are moving through the transition from children to adulthood in that unexplainable time when everything is changing.
[time=1758] And they feel justifiably so that their parents don't understand, their teachers don't understand, their peers don't understand,
[time=1764] and they're all alone to experience this strangeness in their life.
[time=1772] I see it in the eyes of my own wife when the ministry to which God has called us separates us for many nights in a row,
[time=1780] or because of a preaching assignment for a whole week at a time.
[time=1786] I have to be honest and tell you that I experience it myself on occasion when I realize that I am the only man in the congregation who has no pastor.
[time=1796] And when on occasion I am called upon to make a decision with which not everybody agrees, the information about that decision
[time=1806] I cannot share because of the confidentiality of the situation.
[time=1815] I want to retreat from the questions of loneliness that come from a Christian young lady
[time=1823] who waits to die with an unexplained fatal disease.
[time=1829] I fear it as I see it in the faces of older people who seem to have apparently been abandoned by friend and family to grow old and die all by themselves.
[time=1843] I watched it last night on Monday Night Football. As a man whose whole life revolved around that game, sat alone in his study, hundreds of miles from the combat,
[time=1857] watching someone else take the place of leadership he once cherished.
[time=1864] The music of loneliness on the radio. Music like Harry Nilsons without you.
[time=1872] The old country and western song by Hank Williams, I am so lonely I could die.
[time=1879] And Parsons, ballad of a lonely man. The yes blues by the Beatles, Harry Nilsons song that goes like this, one is the loneliest number you'll ever do.
[time=1890] Two can be as bad as one, but the loneliest number is the number one.
[time=1897] And the song that I remember from when I was growing up listening to music that went something like this, all those lonely people, where do they all come from.
[time=1911] The rhyme of the ancient mariner that we learned when we were going to school sums it up, does it not? Alone, alone, all alone, alone on a wide wide sea.
[time=1923] And never a saint took pity on my soul in agony.
[time=1929] Men and women, as I review this problem, I tell you that there are hundreds and scores and thousands of people about whom that poem is a summary of their life.
[time=1940] As David said in the Psalm we read, "They feel no man cares for my soul."
[time=1947] What has happened to us as human beings? What has caused us that we can no longer be near, even though we are right next to each other?
[time=1958] What makes the distant feeling grow within us so that we can be seated next to someone in a church that knows and loves the Blessed Lord?
[time=1970] And never reach out in a meaningful way to touch that person and say, "I know you are there and I care."
[time=1980] I was overwhelmingly surprised as I opened the Bible and began to read with that thought in mind.
[time=1990] I discovered that though the word lonely or loneliness never appears in the Bible even once, and though the word lonely is only in the living Bible one time,
[time=2001] that the pages of this book are filled with illustrations of people who battled that disease, both Christian and non-Christian alike.
[time=2014] And in this introductory message, I'd like to take you on a survey of the Scriptures.
[time=2018] I realize that it will be hard for you to follow as rapidly as I may move.
[time=2024] I would encourage those of you who are here and those who are watching by way of television at home, that if you have a pencil, you may want to jot down the references.
[time=2032] You can find many of them, I'm sure.
[time=2035] But I want you to notice that from time beginning, there have been people like you, like me, who've experienced what we experience when we feel alone, when we feel lonely.
[time=2048] We can go back in the book of Genesis to a man by the name of Enoch.
[time=2054] The Bible says that Enoch walked a path quite apart from his contemporaries.
[time=2059] In a wicked and sinful world, Enoch stands out like a shining star on a black night.
[time=2067] The Bible says that Enoch walked with God and he was not, for God took him.
[time=2074] And on the heels of his path came another by the name of Noah.
[time=2078] To whom God gave an absurd instruction to build a boat where there was no water for the safety of his own family.
[time=2085] For many long years as he carried out the will of his God in heaven, building that huge, huge vessel, he was the subject of abuse on the part of all of his contemporaries.
[time=2097] But Hebrews tells us Noah walked by faith and he did what God told him to do, though he had to do it all by himself.
[time=2105] I want you to turn in your Bibles to the book of Genesis.
[time=2108] And there, in Genesis chapter 16, you will read the story of a woman who experienced loneliness.
[time=2115] She's one of the lesser lights of the Bible, but we know her from her mention in the New Testament book of Galatians.
[time=2122] Her name is Hagar.
[time=2126] Abraham's wife Sarah could bear him no children.
[time=2129] She took Hagar, her handmaid, and gave her unto Abraham for a wife.
[time=2136] When this Egyptian servant became pregnant, according to Genesis 16, she began to hate Sarah.
[time=2142] And when the hostility between those two women grew to a boiling point, Sarah banished Hagar to the wilderness.
[time=2153] She fled to the wilderness in fear.
[time=2156] Here alone and frightened, she sat down by a fountain of water.
[time=2162] As you read the story in Genesis 16, you cannot miss the stress of her loneliness.
[time=2167] She is all by herself.
[time=2170] She is away from family, away from friend, and there is no one there.
[time=2174] And how God dealt with her at that time in her life should be an encouragement to all of us, whoever experienced that emotion.
[time=2182] Walk with me to the mountain of Moriah, where Abraham, leaving his servants alone at the base of the mountain,
[time=2191] trudges his way up to the pinnacle of that mountain with his only son Isaac, to carry out an unexplained instruction from his God,
[time=2203] an instruction that said, "Take that son who is the object of your love and the hope and promise of the coming nation,
[time=2210] and put him to death." So isolated was Abraham and that experience that he could not even take his servants with him.
[time=2219] And he and his son went together alone to that mountain.
[time=2227] Moses was a man apart.
[time=2230] We read of him in the book of Exodus.
[time=2233] While working in Pharaoh's court, he often took long walks all by himself.
[time=2239] And on one of those walks on an occasion, he came across an Egyptian who was fighting with a Hebrew.
[time=2245] And the white-hot heat of his Jewish zealous heart caused him to murder the Egyptian,
[time=2253] and he was therefore banished by Pharaoh to the wilderness of Midian.
[time=2257] The next time we find him in the third chapter, he is wandering around on the backside of the desert in Midian,
[time=2263] taking care of Jethro's sheep, his father-in-law's sheep.
[time=2267] Certainly during those years in his life, Moses experienced the loneliness that people today talk about.
[time=2278] David's experience of loneliness was of the deepest variety.
[time=2283] I wish I had time to take you through all the psalms that I've read this week where he expressed that,
[time=2289] but I've chosen three to illustrate what David felt.
[time=2293] And we're indebted to David, the psalmist, because he put into the words of some psalms
[time=2300] the way that a lonely person cries out to his maker.
[time=2304] He expressed his loneliness so that we could identify with it and understand it.
[time=2309] Turn first to Psalm 102.
[time=2312] And there in the third verse and in verses 6 and 7, you will read the words of the psalmist as he expresses his solitude.
[time=2322] He wrote Psalm 102 verses 3 and verses 6 and 7, "My days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth."
[time=2334] Listen, I am like a pelican in the wilderness.
[time=2337] I am like an owl of the desert.
[time=2340] I watch and am as a sparrow alone on the housetop.
[time=2346] In the Psalm, which we read at the beginning of this message today, David wrote, "I looked on my right hand and beheld, but there was no man.
[time=2355] And I looked for refuge, and refuge failed me.
[time=2361] No man cares for my soul." David felt that.
[time=2367] Turn back in the book of Psalms to the 69th Psalm and the 20th verse, Psalm 69 in verse 20.
[time=2375] Listen to the words of the psalmist.
[time=2379] "Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness,
[time=2386] and I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none.
[time=2391] And for comforters, but I found none."
[time=2399] Could not miss the man Job in the Old Testament,
[time=2405] for he may stand out as the extreme and supreme example of a lonely man.
[time=2411] He alone feels and thinks of his suffering.
[time=2415] Yet nowhere does he find a receptive response.
[time=2419] His friends come to comfort him.
[time=2422] Any of us who look at that story from present day perspective, could we have the option of summoning Job's friends to be an encouragement to us in our loneliness would gladly decline.
[time=2434] In the midst of his suffering, he even felt that God had abandoned him.
[time=2440] He is an island unto himself in the story, confronting the pain of his very being.
[time=2448] Elijah the prophet, whose record is given to us in the book of Kings, 1 Kings, chapter 19, seems to vacillate back and forth from public ministry and lonely hiding.
[time=2462] He walks into the presence of King Ahab and announces a drought.
[time=2468] At most courageous moment in his young prophetic life, and the next thing we know, he's been banished to the Brook Chareth, where he sits alone waiting for God to meet his physical needs.
[time=2479] He comes out of hiding to go to Mount Carmel and there to confront the prophets of Baal.
[time=2484] In a most majestic and victorious moment, he calls down fire from heaven, and it licks up the sacrifice in all the water that had been poured around it.
[time=2492] Finally, we feel Elijah must have conquered his own personal need.
[time=2498] The next vision we have of him is running away from Ahab's wife, Jezebel, who has threatened to take his head.
[time=2504] He runs to the wilderness, and we see him there seated under the juniper tree, crying out to God, "Oh God, I'd rather die than be like this.
[time=2512] Please take my life."
[time=2519] He writes, as he expresses his heart, the words that many have felt.
[time=2524] In 1 Kings 19, 9, and 10, he says, "I have been very jealous for the Lord of Hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken the covenant and thrown down the altars and slain the prophets with the sword." "And I, even I only am left, and now they seek to take my life."
[time=2542] That was his emotion.
[time=2543] I'm the only one, God.
[time=2545] Everybody else is a man in the faith, and I'm alone.
[time=2548] I'm all by myself.
[time=2553] Jeremiah is representative of the prophets when he laments in Jeremiah 15-17.
[time=2560] I say not, I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced.
[time=2567] I sat alone because of thy hand, for thou hast filled me with indignation.
[time=2571] Jeremiah said, "I found no consolation anywhere.
[time=2574] I was all by myself." When we leave the pages of the Old Testament and we walk into the vestibule of the new, we are introduced almost immediately to the disciples, who are called by the Savior to be at his hand to help and encourage him
[time=2591] and walk with him in his earthly ministry.
[time=2594] And as we read the story, we can almost feel the growing emotion of fear and anxiety that wells up within them as the Savior begins to tell them of his impending death.
[time=2604] Finally, through their unwillingness to believe that information, they begin to accept the fact that he is really going to die, that they are going to be deprived of his presence.
[time=2619] And they hurt with the realization and the misunderstanding that surrounds the loneliness of their knowledge.
[time=2627] The Apostle Paul in writing to young Timothy in 2 Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 16,
[time=2633] wrote this terse statement, "All men forsook me."
[time=2641] Oh, the sting of loneliness in those words.
[time=2645] Everybody left me.
[time=2649] Best of all, in the news of lonely people in the Bible, is the news men and women that the Savior, the Christ,
[time=2659] felt the loneliness that you feel.
[time=2662] The Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews and the fourth chapter in verse 15 that we have not in high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings and infirmities, but has been tested in all points like as we are yet without sin.
[time=2679] Quite often, when we read that verse, I'm impressed with the fact that people accept that as a part of the Bible, but they have a hard time understanding how Christ could identify with them in their problem.
[time=2691] Early in his ministry as Jesus began to teach his disciples, he warned them.
[time=2696] In the words of John 1632, with these words, "He warned them, 'Behold, the hour cometh, yay is now come, that she shall be scattered, every man to his own, and I will be left alone.'" That's what Jesus said. And as I read those words, I could not help but think about the fact that he not only experienced the loneliness when it came, but he knew intimately that it was coming, and all that went with the anticipation of it was his as well.
[time=2724] You follow him in the closing hours of his life to the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=2728] He takes with him his three beloved friends, and he asks of them one simple thing, "Will you simply stay here at the edge of the garden and watch and pray with me?" He goes into the garden to wrestle with God over God's will in his own life and the coming and impending judgment of sin upon him when he comes back to find his friends. He finds them asleep.
[time=2750] You cannot miss the loneliness in the words that he spoke when he said, "What could you not watch with me one hour?" Three times that was his experience.
[time=2764] Men and women in the strangling grip of Golgotha on Calvary
[time=2770] are Savior experienced, the maximum impact of loneliness.
[time=2776] For you see, for a seeming eternity, the father abandoned him.
[time=2784] His friends had already fled. One of his disciples had betrayed him.
[time=2792] Now even his father turned away.
[time=2796] And in the awful agony of that moment, the words of Matthew 27, 45, and 46
[time=2802] seemed to scream out at us as Jesus in that dark hour cried out,
[time=2808] "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=2817] The loneliness of that moment is beyond description.
[time=2821] But I want to tell you something, folks. It is the certain guarantee that he is able to understand us in our battle with the enemy of loneliness
[time=2830] for he has felt it every wit.
[time=2836] No, the words lonely and loneliness do not appear in the Bible.
[time=2845] But loneliness is in the Bible.
[time=2849] It seems as if on almost every page.
[time=2854] In one form or another, in the lives of sinner and saint, we see it at work.
[time=2861] Certainly this makes it hard to swallow. Does it not?
[time=2866] The stock testimony of so many Christians who say, "Oh, I'm never lonely.
[time=2874] I have Christ." Or, "How can I be lonely when Christ is with me?"
[time=2883] It's the impression when he hears these words that they are saying what they know they ought to say rather than what they experience.
[time=2891] Morris West has written a book called "The Devil's Advocate" in which he speaks more honestly.
[time=2898] He does not deny loneliness.
[time=2901] But he says, "Let me tell you something important. It is no new thing to be lonely."
[time=2907] It comes to all of us sooner or later, friends die, family dies, lovers and husbands too.
[time=2914] We get old, we get sick.
[time=2918] And the last and greatest loneliness is death.
[time=2921] There are no pills to cure that.
[time=2924] There are no formulas to make it go away.
[time=2928] It is a condition of men that we cannot escape.
[time=2931] And if we try to run from it, we are driven to a darker hell than the one we experience in the midst of it.
[time=2939] But if we face it, wrote West, we remember that there are a million others like us.
[time=2946] And if we reach out to come for them and not ourselves, we discover in the end that we are lonely no longer.
[time=2954] For we are in a new family, the family of man.
[time=2959] And I think there are some great truths in those lines, but I'd like to tell you that as Christians, we can go one step further.
[time=2967] Not only are we in the family of men, but men and women, we are in the family of God.
[time=2977] And we have the reassurance that God wants to meet us, even in our loneliness.
[time=2983] When I studied these scriptures, which we have rehearsed, one day in my study, I began to make some observations that fairly caused me to have a prayer meeting and rejoicing time before the Lord.
[time=2996] I discovered a consistency in the lives of all of these people, and I couldn't wait to turn to the next one and see is it there and it was.
[time=3005] I learned that these people who experienced loneliness in the darkest hour of their night, at that time in their life, God broke through into their presence in a real and meaningful way that is almost astonishingly consistent as we study it throughout the scripture.
[time=3022] God broke in upon the loneliness of Enoch's solitary walk and singled him out for an Old Testament rapture. He took him home to God.
[time=3030] God broke in upon the life of Noah.
[time=3034] And rewarded him for his courageous faithfulness with the safety of his family and the blessing of God.
[time=3039] And Genesis 8-1 says, "Very simply, and God remembered Noah."
[time=3048] Turn in your Bibles again to the 16th chapter of the book of Genesis.
[time=3053] Notice it there that God met Hagar in the wilderness as she waited alone by the fountain of waters.
[time=3061] And so precious was the ministry of God to Hagar that she named the place after experience with God.
[time=3070] Look at what it says in the 13th verse of Genesis 16.
[time=3074] And she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, "Thou Lord seeest me."
[time=3080] For she said, "Have I also here seen him that seeeth me?"
[time=3086] And the next verse says, "Wherefore the well was called bear la hiroi."
[time=3092] Which being interpreted is, "The well of him who liveeth and seeeth me."
[time=3098] Hagar was in the wilderness by herself, and God saw her, and she saw that God saw her,
[time=3105] and she named a memorial in the Old Testament to the awareness of God of a lonely person.
[time=3113] Walk with me again to the mountain of Moriah and the 22nd chapter of the book of Genesis.
[time=3120] Abraham's experience was not unlike Hagars when he was in the depths of his lonely obedience.
[time=3125] God met him just at the moment, just at the exact moment when God knew that the testing had gone far enough.
[time=3134] He broke in upon the silence, read Genesis 22 beginning at verse 11,
[time=3140] "And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham, and he said, 'Here am I.'" And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him.
[time=3150] For now I know that thou fearst God, seeing thou hast not withheld thine son, thine only son." And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.
[time=3161] And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
[time=3166] Now notice, and Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah Jairah.
[time=3171] Literally which means the Lord will provide.
[time=3175] I couldn't help but think that in the Old Testament there are two monuments to a God who cares about lonely people.
[time=3181] Bear Lahiroi and Jehovah Jairah stand out in the Old Testament as a willingness of God to meet us when we hurt and are all alone.
[time=3193] It was while Moses was alone in the desert of Midian.
[time=3197] In that third chapter of the book of Exodus, the story of the burning bush recorded in Exodus chapter 3
[time=3204] provides another illustration that while he was on the backside of that desert, it was there.
[time=3209] In that circumstance that the bush burned and God spoke and revealed himself unto Moses and he said, "I'm here and I want you to serve me." And he called him into service.
[time=3219] Job is not different from the rest. He too met God in his loneliness.
[time=3224] In the midst of the tragedy of his broken life, Job 38.1, God spoke to him out of the whirlwind
[time=3231] and no longer was it an absentee God, but it was a present God.
[time=3235] And in Job chapter 42 and verse 5, these are the words which Job spoke as the result of his experience.
[time=3242] He said, "I have heard thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine I hath seen thee."
[time=3251] And he spoke for many who in the midst of their loneliness have seen God by the eye of faith.
[time=3258] Elijah was taken by God from the anguish of his experience under the juniper tree and his wish for death
[time=3266] and exhorted to go to the mountain of Horrib where he sat outside of a cave.
[time=3272] The 19th chapter of the book of Kings tells the story.
[time=3277] And God said, "Stand upon the mount before the Lord, and behold, the Lord pass by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broken pieces the rocks before the Lord." But the Lord was not in the wind.
[time=3289] And behold, an earthquake, and after the earthquake of fire.
[time=3293] But the Lord was not in the earthquake or the fire.
[time=3296] But after the fire is still a small voice which spoke in the silence of that dark night
[time=3303] to the lonely, hurting heart of Elijah.
[time=3307] David who wrote of his loneliness is the same David men and women who wrote, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." When I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, he walks with me.
[time=3318] He's the same psalmist who wrote Psalm 27, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[time=3325] The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid."
[time=3332] To the lonely disciples who mourned in the anticipated absence of their Savior, Jesus Christ came in John 14 and he said, "Let not your heart be troubled." He believed in God, believe also in me.
[time=3344] My Father's house are many mansions.
[time=3346] If it were not so, I would have told you.
[time=3348] I go to prepare a place, and if I go, I will come again.
[time=3351] And when you drop down in the text for a few verses, you discover that on the heels of that promise of the future, he did not neglect the present.
[time=3358] He said, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter."
[time=3365] That he may abide with you forever.
[time=3368] And every Bible student knows that the word comforter comes right out of the Greek, which means a word which means a paraclete, one who stands along beside you.
[time=3379] Jesus said to those hurting lonely disciples, "The Holy Spirit will come to stand by you."
[time=3387] In the very next verse, after Paul's declaration that no man stood with him, I couldn't believe it.
[time=3392] It was the last discovery I made on my journey.
[time=3395] It says, "Get this. No man stood with me.
[time=3399] Nevertheless, the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, and I was delivered."
