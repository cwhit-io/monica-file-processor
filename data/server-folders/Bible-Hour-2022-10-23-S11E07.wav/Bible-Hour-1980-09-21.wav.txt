[time=45] I want to say a word of appreciation to those of you who fight through the awful traffic jam and the hallway to get to the service.
[time=52] Your patience is appreciated, and we thank you.
[time=56] We also welcome those who have joined us now by television.
[time=58] It is our prayer that this will be an hour of blessing and encouragement to each and every one of us as we study God's word together.
[time=65] Throughout the hour, we'll be sharing the music of the faith, beginning right now with this wonderful hymn by our choir.

[time=134] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=145] Oh, Lord, let me like Mary through the room.
[time=153] Come with a gift to thee.
[time=158] Show to me now we have to be true.
[time=165] We need to come for thee.
[time=171] Let's not forget this ceremony.
[time=177] Let's not forget the night of you.
[time=184] Let's not forget my love for me.
[time=190] We need to come for thee.
[time=236] Let's not forget my night of you.
[time=242] Let's not forget my love for me.
[time=249] We need to come for thee.
[time=280] Thank you, choir, for that good ministry to our hearts.
[time=285] There are a great number of people who are involved in making possible the sharing of our service with the folks who watch at home, all of the people who are involved in the camera operation and the technical end of this, are members of our church who have been trained to make this possible.
[time=305] And today, we're happy to announce that our audio man, who is also a teacher in the Christian school here, followed by the name of Joe Rich, is here rejoicing in the Lord as he has not been in recent days.
[time=319] For last night at 847, his wife presented to him Amanda Christine Rich, six pounds and 11 ounces.
[time=327] And Mary Ann is watching by television today.
[time=330] I just wanted to share with her that her husband is doing all right.
[time=334] He seems to be making it through the service this morning.
[time=337] And I'm sure he will survive.
[time=339] Congratulations to the riches.
[time=340] Let's listen to some music.
[time=342] Pastor Don Kruger is going to sing for us.
[time=344] Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[time=374] To receive power and riches and wisdom and strength.
[time=390] Honor and glory and blessing.
[time=400] Worthy is the lamb.
[time=409] Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[time=419] Worthy is the lamb.
[time=428] To receive power and riches and wisdom and strength.
[time=449] Worthy is the lamb.
[time=459] Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[time=472] Worthy is the lamb.
[time=491] We are indeed grateful that you've joined us on the Bible
[time=504] Hour today.
[time=505] We take these few moments while we're having the reception of our offering here in the auditorium.
[time=510] From my wife Don and I to sit together and talk to those of you who are at home watching the television program today.
[time=517] And we really do appreciate the opportunity to share with you what is happening in the Bible Hour ministry and to extend to you an invitation to become more involved through the opportunity to study God's Word with us through the week as well as on Sunday.
[time=532] Donna that is indeed a great opportunity.
[time=535] Yes it is.
[time=536] Our program is called the Bible Hour and it's called that because our emphasis is on the Word of God and we really feel that it's vital as born-again Christians that we spend time each day in God's Word if we are to grow and we'd like to encourage you to join us in reading through the Bible in one year by means of the daily walk which is a little booklet that we would like to send you and it would give you a daily guide for reading through the scriptures in one year and if you were to start in October then you would begin in Matthew and by the end of this year in December you would have read through the entire New Testament.
[time=572] Donna some of the folks who hear this broadcast on a delayed basis are wondering how they can start in October when it's already in the middle of October for some of them or perhaps even the first few days but I want you to know that if we get your requests for the daily walk we'll send you the October issue and you'll have plenty of time to get caught up to date and you can begin in the book of Matthew and as Donna has mentioned by the end of this year you will have read the entire New Testament and not only will you have read the passages in the New Testament but you will have read commentaries on each of the sections as well as an application to your own life and well I promise you the daily walk will make a difference because it will get you into the Word of God and more than that it will get the Word of God into you.
[time=611] We hear from people on occasion who have experienced that very blessing from reading the Word of God and Donna has a letter that she received this week from someone who has been exposed to the daily walk plan.
[time=623] This person writes I am a new Christian and I can't seem to absorb enough.
[time=629] I read the daily walk each day and am refreshed and renewed in spirit, mind and body and the Word of God can do that for you also.
[time=638] If you would like to receive a free copy of the daily walk all you need to do is call us at our toll free number.
[time=645] That number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=650] Ask for the Bible Hour Operator and we'll be happy to send you a free copy of the daily walk.
[time=656] Once again that toll free number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=662] Donna, while people are calling and writing we want to express our desire to hear from the many new friends we've developed through the National Christian Network which is carrying the Bible Hour across this country in the many cable systems that are growing up in the cities and communities.
[time=677] Already this past week we've received letters from Arkansas and Utah and out on the west coast Washington and Idaho and it's just a thrilling thing to know that people in far-flowing areas of the United States are hearing the Bible Hour and especially it's exciting to us when we know that because you've communicated with us.
[time=696] So as you watch the Bible Hour today if you haven't written to us already I hope you'll take time to do that and sit down and write to us at the Bible Hour Office.
[time=703] The address is very easy to remember.
[time=705] Simply write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=713] And of course if you'd like to have your free copy of The Daily Walk you can do that as simply as Donna has explained it to you by calling the toll-free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=724] It's an absolutely free call from any place in the United States when you call our operator.
[time=729] We'll take your name and address and we'll be shipping your Daily Walk to you this week.
[time=733] Thank you for being a part of this ministry.
[time=735] Stay with us as we go back to our service and share together the second in this series of messages on loneliness.
[time=741] Today we're talking about the subject, the lonely servant, and a great character study on the man Jeremiah from the Old Testament.
[time=748] I hope you'll be with us throughout the entire hour.
[time=771] [MUSIC - 186 seconds]
[time=977] Thank you. Did you listen to the words?
[time=980] Wow what a message and many of you identify with that.
[time=983] Do you remember what it was like before Jesus found you?
[time=987] And now you can rejoice in the fact that you are his and he is yours. We have a new duet that's developed in our church.
[time=995] We're so excited about it and I told you we'd be hearing from them from time to time. What a tremendous song they have to share with you. We'll lift you right to the heights.
[time=1006] Listen carefully as they sing for us now.
[time=1011] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=1044] For me, the manger to his own stranger.
[time=1056] The man of sorrows, tears and agony.
[time=1068] Oh, how I'm all near, how I adore him.
[time=1080] My breath, my sunshine, my holy know.
[time=1091] The great creator became my savior.
[time=1103] And oh God's fullness dwelleth in thee.
[time=1116] Without reluctance flesh and blood his substance.
[time=1127] He took the form of man.
[time=1133] We feel God's hidden plan.
[time=1139] Oh God's mistress sacrifice of Calvary.
[time=1150] And now I know he is the great I am.
[time=1162] Oh, how I'm all near, how I adore him.
[time=1175] My breath, my sunshine, my holy know.
[time=1186] The great creator became my savior.
[time=1199] And oh God's fullness dwelleth in thee.
[time=1218] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1231] Wasn't that tremendous? Hey man, that was great.
[time=1236] I want you to take your Bibles this morning and let's turn together to the Old Testament prophecy of Jeremiah.
[time=1243] Jeremiah the 15th chapter.
[time=1249] About in the middle of the Old Testament you will find Jeremiah's prophecy.
[time=1253] And our scripture lesson this morning is from the 15th chapter verses 17.
[time=1258] I'm sorry verses 17 and 18 in the 15th chapter of the book of Jeremiah.
[time=1268] These words from the prophet, "I sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced.
[time=1276] I sat alone because of thy hand, for thou hast filled me with indignation.
[time=1281] Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuses to be healed?
[time=1287] Will thou be altogether unto me like a liar and like waters that fail?
[time=1295] Let us pray together.
[time=1297] Father in heaven take thy word today as we study it and as we learn it, cause that it shall be used of God to be a help and encouragement to our hearts, bring conviction to each of us as we realize how often we fail of the grace that is made available to us,
[time=1315] cause that as we examine our own hearts and look at our own lives,
[time=1321] we will find room for God's word to make a change.
[time=1326] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1333] We are talking together during these days on the subject of loneliness.
[time=1338] Last week the lonely saints and today the lonely servant.
[time=1346] Our message today is an expose of the loneliness of leadership.
[time=1354] It helps us to understand the phenomena that is taking place in our world today,
[time=1361] where men and women who are in places of leadership under stress and experiencing great emotion
[time=1369] seem to be doing things which are incongruous, they make no sense.
[time=1375] Responding to the pressure of their lives, they are doing that which many around them do not understand.
[time=1383] The loneliness of leadership I say, for if the leader is defined as one walking ahead,
[time=1391] he necessarily will be separated from the group.
[time=1395] It is quite impossible to walk in front of someone without turning your back upon them, so to speak.
[time=1404] At the same time while you are doing all of that, the full weight and responsibility that you have rests upon you alone,
[time=1411] Joseph Conrad in his typhoon, a maritime story, describes a situation which captures that scenario.
[time=1423] Joseph Conrad said, "Jukes was uncritically glad to have his captain at hand.
[time=1430] It relieved him as though that man had by simply coming on deck taken most of the gale's weight upon his own shoulders.
[time=1438] Such is the prestige and the privilege and the burden of command."
[time=1444] Captain McWeer, who had walked on deck, could expect no relief of that sort from anyone on earth, such as the loneliness of that command.
[time=1458] I am not surprised as I opened my Bible to the pages of the Old Testament to discover there what I have discovered
[time=1465] consistently throughout this book that men of God who served God in their generation by the will of God experienced the emotion of loneliness.
[time=1474] That is why Jeremiah wrote in that passage we have just read, that he sat alone, feeling the indignation of his peers and suffering inwardly that which he described as pain.
[time=1487] For fifty years, Jeremiah the prophet carried on a public ministry, alone and unappreciated.
[time=1495] He watched through the reign of five kings as the nation that he loved disintegrated right in front of him.
[time=1502] In the first few verses of his prophecy we have listed for us the three main kings under whom he served,
[time=1508] along with those three were two who served only three month reigns.
[time=1514] And so was the upheaval of that day that Jeremiah watched it rise and fall under the corrupt leadership of those who came into power.
[time=1522] He saw dissensions and disorder.
[time=1525] He saw disturbing social problems take control of his land.
[time=1530] He saw discontent and despair.
[time=1533] And so unpopular was he as he spoke out against these ills of the day, directed by God to speak against them.
[time=1542] That as we read this book which bears his name we discover that on one occasion he was stoned out of his own city.
[time=1551] He was taken on another occasion and put into prison.
[time=1554] He was beaten in public disgrace before the eyes of those who he sought to win.
[time=1560] He was thrown into a slimy pit there to die.
[time=1565] Jeremiah's heart was so broken as they looked at the devastation around him that he wrote a book of funeral poems which we call the Book of Lamentations.
[time=1575] They are the writings of a discouraged and disheartened prophet who watched the city of Jerusalem be taken away and put into the power of those who knew not his God.
[time=1585] And all of that book is as the fountain of tears from his eyes as he laments what has happened to his beloved people.
[time=1592] Jeremiah ministered during the last 40 years of Judah's history from the 13th year of Josiah the king until the destruction and captivity of that nation.
[time=1604] He was a lonely, discouraged, oftentimes at the threshold of defeat.
[time=1610] And yet somehow for 50 years he managed to wage a war against the evils of his time and maintain a semblance of commitment
[time=1621] and determination before his God.
[time=1623] What made him a lonely man?
[time=1626] There were four things that I noticed as I read through this book and I'm going to be asking you to find passages with me in it so I hope you have your Bibles available.
[time=1635] Four things that hurt Jeremiah and four things that helped him.
[time=1641] The first thing I noticed as I began to read about his prophecy was that he was depressed by the decline of his nation.
[time=1650] Turn in your Bibles to the 5th chapter of the book of Jeremiah.
[time=1654] And notice what he says in verses 30 and 31.
[time=1659] He writes, "An appalling and a horrible thing is committed in this land.
[time=1665] The prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means.
[time=1671] And my people love to have it so." Jeremiah said, "We have false prophets who stand up and speak as if they were speaking from the Lord.
[time=1679] And we have priests who have allowed money to creep into their motivation.
[time=1684] And the problem is not the corrupt leadership.
[time=1686] The problem is that God's people like it that way.
[time=1690] "My people love to have it so," he said.
[time=1693] And as he looked at the decline and he looked at the awful situation of apathy among the people who were supposed to be God's people,
[time=1701] there was a kind of depression that swept into that leader's soul.
[time=1706] One of the key words in the book of Jeremiah is the word backslide.
[time=1710] Some of you probably thought that was a Baptist term, but it goes all the way back to the book of Jeremiah.
[time=1716] Over and over again, this book talks about God's people being backslidden in condition.
[time=1722] First of all, in chapter 2 verse 19, we see it.
[time=1726] Here we read, "Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and that backsliding shall reprove thee.
[time=1733] No therefore, and see that it is an evil thing and bitter." Turn to chapter 3 in verse 6.
[time=1739] "The Lord said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done."
[time=1747] Notice verse 8, "And I saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away."
[time=1755] Notice verse 22, "Return ye backsliding children I will heal your backslidings."
[time=1761] One gets the impression as he reads through this book that the people of God were in a backslidden condition.
[time=1768] Jeremiah cried out against that as he saw it, but his cries fell on deaf ears.
[time=1778] Years ago, Lord McCauley, the great British historian, wrote these words about another man in a different time.
[time=1785] Words that could easily have been applied to Jeremiah the prophet.
[time=1788] He wrote, "It is difficult to conceive any situation more painful than that of a great man, condemned to watch the lingering agony of an exhausted country,
[time=1801] to tend it during the alternating fits of stupefaction and raving which precede its dissolution,
[time=1808] and to see the symptoms of vitality disappear one by one until nothing is left but coldness and darkness and corruption."
[time=1817] And that's what Jeremiah did.
[time=1819] He stood in the nation that he loved, to whom God had called him, and he watched as one by one the symptoms of vitality were plucked out of the land,
[time=1828] and the nation went into a terrible awful moral decline, ultimately ending up in their captivity.
[time=1835] Jeremiah went to his grave seeing the death of his nation.
[time=1841] He was depressed by the decline of his nation.
[time=1845] But secondly, he was a lonely, heartbroken man because he was disheartened by the disinterest of the people.
[time=1852] It is one thing to watch a nation fall. It is another thing to watch it fall, and the people who are a part of the problem are totally insensitive to the problem.
[time=1862] You could write over the generation of Jeremiah's day the words apathy and indifference.
[time=1869] Jeremiah wept over it.
[time=1872] Most of us know Jeremiah as the weeping prophet.
[time=1876] Maybe you think that comes just from the book of lamentations, but it is found over and over again in his writings.
[time=1882] Turn with me to the ninth chapter in the first verse.
[time=1886] Here in chapter 9 verse 1 we read, "O that my head were waters and my eyes of fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people."
[time=1899] Look at chapter 13 and verse 17, "But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride."
[time=1910] Jeremiah said, "I am challenging you to turn back to God, and you will not listen, and I will weep in my closet for you because you will not hear."
[time=1919] You are so disinterested in what God would say to you. Notice chapter 14 and verse 17, "Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them."
[time=1928] Let my eyes run down with tears night and day. Let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow.
[time=1941] We had time this morning we could turn to the book of lamentations in there, multiply reference after reference as Jeremiah poured out his tears and his crying.
[time=1951] That had been reared on the precepts of God and had turned away from those precepts. God had raised up a prophet who came to pronounce God's judgment and his deliverance, and they did not listen, their ears were closed and they would not hear.
[time=1967] And as Jeremiah thought about that in the night watches, there was an awful sense of loneliness that swept into his soul. He stood alone as a representative of God in a decadent society, and that awful loneliness he described as pain.
[time=1984] He was depressed by the decline of his nation. He was disheartened by the disinterest of the people.
[time=1991] But he was also distressed by the desertion of his friends. It is one thing to cry out to a nation that does not hear. It is even more difficult to look around and realize that those who should stand with you no longer walk in your path.
[time=2006] They too have turned away and become a part of the problem instead of a part of the solution. When Jeremiah wrote in the book of lamentations and in the first chapter verses 20 and 21, these are the words which he penned.
[time=2019] "Behold, O Lord, for I am in distress. My heart is troubled. My heart is turned within me, for I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword be rivet at home. It is like death. They have heard that I sigh. There is none to comfort me. All mine enemies have heard of my trouble, and they're glad that thou hast done it." That was the emotion that man felt.
[time=2048] Even the people that should have stood with him deserted him. That's why he could write the words with which we began our lesson this morning in the 15th chapter. Words that reminded us of his loneliness.
[time=2063] He said, "I sat alone in the assembly. No man stood with me. Depressed because of the decline of his nation. Disheartened because of the disinterest of the people.
[time=2077] Distressed because of the desertion of his friends. Jeremiah succumbed to what all of us are prone to do in such situation. He was determined to disown it all.
[time=2094] He had what we call in the modern vernacular, his own private pity party. We read about it over in the 20th chapter of the book of Jeremiah verses 14 through 18. And as we think back through what we've already learned about this lonely man, we cannot really blame him from the human standpoint that he wanted to die.
[time=2118] So descriptive is his terminology that we must read it to get the full impact of it. Beginning at the 14th verse, "Cursed be the day on which I was born. Let not the day on which my mother bore me be blessed.
[time=2134] Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying a male child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that man be like the cities which the Lord overthrew and repented not. Let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontime, because he slew me not from the womb, or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me. Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame?"
[time=2163] Jeremiah said, "I rule the day of my birth. Don't ever mention my birthday again. I wish I had been born. And the man who came down to the father's room from the maternity ward to say to me that a child, to him that a child had been born, I wish that man had never been born. Cursed be the messenger of my birth."
[time=2183] That's how low he was. Someone, I don't know who it was, took time to write a paraphrase of that particular passage of Scripture. A paraphrase written by a modern day pastor had to have been written on Monday morning, and this is how it goes.
[time=2203] I had no idea when you call me into your service that it would be like this. I pictured myself preaching great sermons, perhaps working a miracle now, and then I foresaw some opposition, but I thought I would override it in calm victory.
[time=2217] You never mentioned my destruction, or the number of those who would despise me. You neglected to mention that everyone in Jerusalem would mock me constantly.
[time=2227] I'm the laughingstock of all Judah. Everyone points or smirks or laughs or snarls at me when I walk down the street, even the smallest children. I quit.
[time=2239] You ever feel like that? I quit. That was where Jeremiah was. He wanted to disown the whole thing.
[time=2248] In fact, if you'll turn back to the ninth chapter, you'll discover that he did what everyone I'm sure at one time or another has thought of doing. He thought of doing it.
[time=2261] I always like this verse. I identify with this. This is what he wrote, 9 verse 2, "Oh, that I had a wilderness lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people and go from them, for they are all adulterers and assembly of treacherous men." What was he saying?
[time=2281] I wish I had a motel six in the wilderness that I could run and get away from all this hassle. I'd do it tomorrow. If I could just get in my car and drive away from it, leave it all behind me. Oh, what a good feeling that would be. That was where Jeremiah was. Just leave it all behind.
[time=2302] You ever feel like that? Everyone in a place of responsibility of any kind on occasion has that emotion. Dr. James Conway in his book, "Men in the Midlife Crisis," talks about how he felt on occasion as a pastor and as a father.
[time=2322] He said, "Sometimes I feel like a computer. They push a button and a sermon comes out. They push another button and a good stewardship message comes out.
[time=2331] My kids push a button and money comes out. My wife pushes a button and a night out comes." He said, "I am so tired of being programmed.
[time=2338] Sometimes," he said, "I had the emotion of wanting to get in my car, not even being concerned about what direction it was headed and just start to drive."
[time=2347] That was where Jeremiah was. He wanted to get away from it all. But you know men and women, he didn't. He didn't.
[time=2359] For 50 years, he stayed by the stuff, unappreciated. Nobody gave him applause. Nobody came by and said, "Boy, that's tremendous what you're doing to save our nation."
[time=2377] He was faithful to what God called him to do even though he had his low moments. He never wavered from the task. How did he do it?
[time=2389] I've got some good news for you. What he did, you can do. And the things that were true in his life can be true in your life.
[time=2400] There were four stabilizing things in the life of Jeremiah that kept him secure even though many times, all by himself and alone, that kept him at the task to which God had called him, four very concrete principles that caused him to be victorious in his life.
[time=2417] First of all, he had a conviction of his calling. I want you to turn with me again to the 20th chapter of the book of Jeremiah, which is a key chapter in this book.
[time=2430] He had a conviction of his calling. One of the other emotions that Jeremiah felt on occasion is akin to that which we go through periodically.
[time=2440] Here's what he reasoned. He said, "Well, if what I say doesn't meet the approval of people, it seems like no matter what I do, whenever I open my mouth, somebody doesn't like it. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm not even going to talk. I'm just going to be quiet. I'm going into silence.
[time=2456] I won't even mention the Lord's name. That was what he thought about doing. I want you to read this. Jeremiah chapter 20 verse 9, "Then I said, 'I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.'" Notice, but his word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not refrain.
[time=2483] Jeremiah said, "I wanted to just shut up about Christ, about God. Not even mention his name anymore, but when I tried to forbear, and when I tried to refrain, God's word was like a fire burning in my bones, and that fire had to be vented, and I couldn't keep quiet. I had to speak."
[time=2506] You say, "Where in the world did he get such conviction?" It came in his life with the realization that he was a man upon whom the call of God had come.
[time=2518] If you will go back in the first chapter to read about his call, you will understand why that was such an important part of his life.
[time=2526] When God called Jeremiah to be his man, we read in chapter 1 verses 4 and 5, "Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 'Before I formed the in the womb I knew thee, and before thou cameest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.'"
[time=2545] I want you to notice that there are four things in that verse about his calling. They come in this order. God said, "Jeremiah, I knew you before you were formed. I formed you in the womb. I sanctified you and set you apart for my service, and I ordained you, and you're my man, and you do it."
[time=2564] You know what the word "Jeremiah" means? I've always known what my first name David meant, but I never really knew for sure the meaning behind Jeremiah. Oh, it's been a blessing to me.
[time=2577] The word "Jeremiah" literally means "whom Jehovah appoints."
[time=2583] Jeremiah realized that he was an appointed servant. He was called by God, and in the midst of the discouragements of his life and the problems of his society, the thing that held him in was the realization that he was where God wanted him to be, doing what God wanted him to do, and though he didn't understand the circumstances, that was enough for him.
[time=2604] When I got ready to go in the ministry, my father told me one day, he said, "David, if you can do anything else, do it." I thought that was rather strange advice for a man to give his son when I knew he'd been praying all of his life that I'd be a preacher.
[time=2619] That's what he meant was this. If your call to the gospel ministry is not so much a part of what you are, that you can happily do anything else and be in the will of God. If you can do it, do it.
[time=2633] Because if you're not certain that God has called you and puts you where you are, when the trouble comes, you'll vacillate. You'll want to skip out.
[time=2641] That's one of the reasons why we have a lot of people in the ministry who are becoming insurance salesman. They never were sure of their calling in the first place. It was a professional, a vocational thing.
[time=2652] I want to tell you something to be a man of God in this world. Today, you better be sure you're called.
[time=2658] And that's what kept Jeremiah right at it. He knew that God had called him.
[time=2666] Then the second thing, by the way, could I just interject this? That has nothing to do with being a pastor. Each one of you has a calling from God, every one of you.
[time=2676] I don't know what that is. I hope you do. But whatever it is, you better be sure of it. You better examine it.
[time=2682] It may be to be in a business someplace doing a good job in a company and bearing a testimony for Jesus Christ. If you know that's where God puts you, it'll help you when the tough times come.
[time=2693] The second thing I noticed is this. Not only did he have a conviction of his calling, he had a confidence in his companion. Notice again in the 20th chapter and verse 11.
[time=2704] This is what Jeremiah said. Jeremiah chapter 20 verse 11.
[time=2712] Read verse 10 first to get the setting, "For I heard that the faming of many, fear on every side, report, say they, and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall, saying perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him when we shall take our revenge on him." Why, you don't need friends like that.
[time=2730] But notice what Jeremiah said, "But the Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail."
[time=2743] Jeremiah said, "I know they're after me. I know even my friends are trying to get me, but I've got the Lord, and he's my companion."
[time=2753] And God had told him that earlier in his life, way back in the first chapter again when God called him, you know what Jeremiah said when God asked him to go into the ministry?
[time=2765] He said, "Lord, I can't do that. I'm a child. I'm not mature enough."
[time=2771] And the Lord answered his objection in verse 8 of chapter 1 with these words, "Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee."
[time=2781] And notice verse 19, "And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, say of the Lord."
[time=2790] I don't believe in all of the trite sayings that are often passed off on people who experience loneliness that you don't need anybody, but Jesus. I know better than that.
[time=2802] We need companionship. We need fellowship. That's something God has built into us.
[time=2807] And I want to tell you something, in those moments between friends and in those deep and dark caverns of being all alone, the thing that holds a man to the task is the realization that even when everyone misunderstands, if he is right with God in the place, God has put him, he has a companion who stays with him through it all.
[time=2829] If you have a chance today, you read Isaiah 43, 1 to 3. What a tremendous promise.
[time=2837] I am told that when the great New England preacher, Jonathan Edwards, was in his final hour, he had said goodbye to all of his earthly friends, said goodbye to his family, and according to the record, he turned his face over on the pillow toward the wall, and confidently he said,
[time=2858] "Now where's this Jesus of Nazareth, my true and never failing friend? What a way to go out. I've walked with him all my life now. Lord, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to meet you in the next life because I've walked you with you in this life."
[time=2874] Jeremiah had the confidence of his companion.
[time=2880] Thirdly, turn in your Bibles to chapter 17 of Jeremiah and notice this, the thing that held him true in the difficult times was this.
[time=2890] He had a commitment beyond his circumstances. He had a commitment that went beyond his circumstances.
[time=2900] This is a very familiar passage to us. It is very similar to Psalm 1, but listen to it carefully. Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 7, "Blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit."
[time=2925] What is he saying? He's saying, "When you put your roots down deep and trust in God, when your faith is in him, your confidence goes beyond the circumstances."
[time=2937] Notice the circumstances. He said, "When the heat comes, or in the dead of summer, the leaf shall be green and you will not be anxious in the year of drought."
[time=2954] How many carnal Christians there are whose faith vacillates with the circumstances? They've got their trust in the wrong thing. Everything is good and great and wonderful and they're good and great and wonderful.
[time=2966] But Jeremiah said, "In the midst of all of these problems and troubles and difficulties that I have, my trust is in the Lord. I've put my roots down deep and it doesn't matter whether it's summer or winter or what the circumstances are. There's no anxiety necessary
[time=2982] because I have a commitment beyond my circumstances." Do you have that? Do you have a commitment beyond your circumstances or are you in that everyday hassle that so many people have as their experience up and down, up and down with the graph of your surroundings?
[time=3010] He had a commitment beyond his circumstances. I want you to notice fourthly, again in the 20th chapter, that he had a chorus of celebration. Notice chapter 20 verse 13, "Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord, for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil doers."
[time=3039] You say, "How in the world can a man in a situation like Jeremiah was in sing unto the Lord." He did it by faith. He did it by faith. Doctors talk a lot about the threshold of pain.
[time=3056] You know what that is? That's the level at which you experience pain. Some people have a high threshold. They experience pain up here. I have a couple of children have a very low threshold of pain.
[time=3068] It's the level at which you experience pain. Now when you take an analgesic or an aspirin, that has nothing to do with your problem physically. All that does is raise the threshold of pain so you don't feel pain at such a low level.
[time=3085] I'm glad for those. On occasion we all need to have them. But you know what they're discovering? They have discovered that joy raises the threshold of pain.
[time=3098] I just finished reading a book called "The Anatomy of an Illness." It is on the bestseller list and it just is a delightful book. It is about a man who knew he was going to die with a disease and decided if he was going to go out he was going out laughing. So he got someone to get a lot of films of cartoons and humorous films and he got a projector and brought it into his hospital room and he began to watch humorous films all day long from morning till night and he just laughed and cracked his sides.
[time=3127] And you know what? He started to get better. He said if I'm on a dime, I don't want to die in surroundings like this. He rented him a hotel room. A plush hotel room brought his projector and his films went in there and he started laughing in class.
[time=3149] And he demonstrated the truth of an Old Testament statement that says, "A merry heart to do with good like a medicine."
[time=3160] Jeremiah understood a very basic psychological principle that a happy soul is contagious and many times that joy of praise and thanksgiving to God.
[time=3178] And thanksgiving to God dissipates the hurt that you feel.
[time=3187] When Ezra was conducting the revival during the days of Nehemiah, he gave his people a great truth.
[time=3196] In Nehemiah 8-10, this is what it is. He said, "The joy of the Lord is your strength."
[time=3206] Are you joyful? Do you have anything that you're praising God for? You say, "Pastor, if you knew my life, you'd understand how hard that would be for me."
[time=3215] No. I learned a long time ago that even on the very worst of Sundays, there is always something for which I can give thanks.
[time=3222] And on the very worst of days, there is always something for which I can be glad.
[time=3227] While I was on vacation this summer, I had the opportunity of experiencing one of my joys leftover from past ministry, and that is to read the Philadelphia Inquirer.
[time=3240] I love to read that paper, all kinds of features, etc.
[time=3244] One day, they ran a feature story on the death of Otto Frank, who was the father of Anne Frank.
[time=3251] We know her through the diary of Anne Frank, which has been a school play in almost every school in the country at one time or another.
[time=3258] He talked about the hardships and the difficulties he experienced during that awful Holocaust in which they were involved, being prisoners in their own house for over three years.
[time=3270] In the article, he quotes a section from the diary of Anne Frank, who was a prisoner for all of that time, written when she was a little girl on February 23, 1944, this is what she wrote.
[time=3285] Nearly every evening, I go to the attic, and from my favorite spot on the floor, I look up at the blue sky.
[time=3293] As long as this exists, I thought, and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this last, I cannot be unhappy.
[time=3304] Riches can all be lost, but that happiness in your own heart can only be veiled.
[time=3311] I thought, Amen. Amen.
[time=3315] I've got something more than the blue sky and the clouds. I've got Jesus Christ living within.
[time=3321] And though the world may crumble around us, he is the blue sky.
[time=3326] He is the light from on high that thrills and encourages my heart, and as long as I have him, I cannot be unhappy.
[time=3335] Amen. Amen. Let's pray.
[time=3339] Father in Heaven, thank you for Jeremiah's life.
[time=3343] He helps and encourages us. If there are those watching and hearing my voice today who do not know Christ as they ought to know him, help them to come to know him today.
[time=3353] May I say to you, if you don't know Christ as your Savior, you can come to know him today.
[time=3357] If you put your trust in him, ask him to come into your life and receive him as your Savior.
[time=3361] You can do it right there where you are right now.
