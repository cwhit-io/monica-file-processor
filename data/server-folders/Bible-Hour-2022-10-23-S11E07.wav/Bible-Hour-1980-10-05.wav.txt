[time=0] (buzzer buzzes) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=23] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present The Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=29] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=58] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=60] And we welcome you to this service, and especially our friends who have joined us by television.
[time=66] We're going to praise God in this hour, and we're going to honor Him through the study and teaching of His Word.
[time=72] And we're glad you've joined with us, and we hope this will be a time of great blessing and encouragement to your heart as you share The Bible Hour with us this morning.
[time=81] Right now, we listen to the ministry of our choir.
[time=85] (orchestral music) [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=287] - And that is certainly what we attempt to do
[time=310] when we gather here on the Lord's day, to praise the Lord and lift up His name, make Him known to all.
[time=317] We always have music as a part of that message, and some of our very special friends are here to help us praise the Lord today.
[time=325] They're Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=327] They have been with us many times, and they are very special to us.
[time=331] Their fellowship and their music, all that they are personally, means much to all of us here.
[time=337] During the past few days in our services, we have been talking about the problem of loneliness, and the song they've chosen to sing for us reminds us that God has the answer to a broken heart, and He can heal that up if we'll put our lives in His hands.
[time=351] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=492] - We're so very grateful that you've joined us
[time=504] for today's edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=506] I know you're enjoying the music of Stephen Maria and they're gonna be singing for us again in a few moments.
[time=510] But right now we wanna talk to you just a bit about the information that we're sending out to our many television friends through the mail.
[time=518] One of the very special items that we've prepared to help you in your own life spiritually is a book that Donna wants to share with you.
[time=525] Of course Donna is my wife and she's a very good one to give you all the answers.
[time=529] So tell them about the answer book.
[time=531] - That's because I've received them from you before, right?
[time=533] - Right, right.
[time=535] - The book that we have that we would like to offer to you today is called the answer book.
[time=540] And what it is is scripture verses in topical order so that if you have a need to find perhaps a scripture verse on courage and you just look up courage in the answer book and it gives you several scriptures written out that deal with that particular topic.
[time=556] We had an interesting letter in the mail this week from a lady who wrote and she said, please send the answer book.
[time=563] Would it be possible to have three copies?
[time=566] I find it difficult to keep a copy for ourselves.
[time=569] So many people need this well-written booklet and we've received many letters of this nature of people who are using it to help counsel friends and then just give them the booklet to take home.
[time=581] It's a very small booklet that's convenient to stick in your purse or in the back of your Bible or just to keep handy by your phone.
[time=587] And we would like to send you a free copy of the answer book and all you need to do is call us at our toll free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=597] Just ask the Bible our operator and tell her you would like your copy of the answer book and we will get it in the mail to you within a few days.
[time=606] - God, I also heard about a new use of the answer book that really was exciting to me.
[time=610] Someone that I know decided that they would take a little different approach to their family devotions and they decided to discuss one of these topics each time they shared together around the Word of God.
[time=621] So they used the answer book and one day they studied what the Word of God had to say about fear and they read all of the references and shared them together and then they would have their prayer time.
[time=631] The next day they would talk about loneliness and the next day they would talk about guilt.
[time=636] They said it was really a revitalizing thing in their own lives as they came to grips with how the Bible touched on the subjects which are listed in the answer book.
[time=643] So I think there are many uses for it that will be of help to our friends at home.
[time=647] Along with the answer book is our regular daily devotional study book called The Daily Walk.
[time=652] We won't take time to talk much about it today except to say that it's a plan to help you get through the Bible in a year's time.
[time=659] We've just started the New Testament in the October issue and we'd be happy to send you the monthly edition of The Daily Walk to get you started in a daily Bible study program.
[time=669] That's one of the most important things you can do in your own spiritual life to grow and develop as a Christian.
[time=675] So if you don't have a daily study program we'd like to provide it for you and we'll do it if you'll just write and ask for it today.
[time=682] When you write, write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=689] Or Donna, you can share with them again that special number they can call for their free copy of the answer book or The Daily Walk.
[time=696] - We have a toll free number, 1-800-4539,000.
[time=701] And that number is available to you at any time during the week, not just during this hour.
[time=705] So you can just pick up your phone and call us at 1-800-4539,000.
[time=711] Any time this week and just ask for your free copy of the answer book or for a copy of The Daily Walk.
[time=717] - Donna, as we go back to our service now, I want to remind all of our friends that in a moment I'm going to be speaking about the loneliness of spouses.
[time=724] How can loneliness exist when people live together?
[time=727] It's a prevalent disease that's sweeping our country and I think God has something to say about it from the Word of God.
[time=732] Hope you'll all stay with us 'cause we come to the Scripture in just a few moments.
[time=740] [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=918] Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=919] You stay right there because we're going to hear from you again in just a moment.
[time=923] We want to take the opportunity for those who watch our television program locally to invite all of our friends who live here in the Greater Fort Wayne area to a very special
[time=933] day.
[time=934] October the 19th is the groundbreaking for the Family Life Center in Arlington Park.
[time=940] And if you're here for the second-hour worship service, you can participate with us in that great event which will take place right after the morning service, and so we encourage you to be present.
[time=950] Every week on the Bible Hour, we begin the service with a great hymn of praise called
[time=957] How Great Thou Art.
[time=959] Every once in a while we get a letter from someone who says, "You know, I wish I could hear that thing all the way through once.
[time=963] We only get a little bit of it and then it's gone.
[time=967] And I want to dedicate this next number to all of the people who wish they could hear it all the way through, who are obviously people who don't come here because we hear it all the way through every week.
[time=979] But you're going to hear it in a new and different way than you've ever heard it before.
[time=982] How great thou art before the message, Stephen Rhea.
[time=1009] O Lord, my King, when I in awesome wonder, consider all the worlds thy hands had made,
[time=1031] I say the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, thy power throughout, the universe displayed.
[time=1058] And say, "My soul, my Savior God, to thee, how great thou art, how great thou art,
[time=1080] how great thou art, how great thou art, how great thou art."
[time=1110] And when I think how God is sun, not fairing, send him to dark, I swear, scared to give.
[time=1135] Let on the cross my burden gladly bear ring, he bled and died to take over our sick.
[time=1162] For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[time=1170] him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1174] When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation, to take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
[time=1195] When I share God, in humble evolution, and their proclaim, my God, how great thou art.
[time=1218] Then say, "My soul, my Savior God, to thee, how great thou art, how great thou art."
[time=1262] how great thou art."
[time=1283] That is a great hymn and the words remind us of our ultimate purpose as children of
[time=1290] the human family and that is to enjoy God and to glorify him forever and that's what
[time=1298] we need to be doing.
[time=1299] We want to do that as we study his wonderful word today so take your Bibles and let's turn together to the book of Ephesians, Ephesians chapter 5 and I'm reading from the 25th verse through the end of the chapter, Ephesians 5, 25 through 33, husbands love
[time=1319] your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify
[time=1328] and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself
[time=1334] a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy
[time=1340] and without blemish, so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that love of his wife love of themself.
[time=1347] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh but he nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church, for we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.
[time=1358] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh, this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular, soul of his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband and shall we pray.
[time=1379] And Father we thank you for this truth that is given to us.
[time=1386] I thank you that as a man, as a husband you have a word for me and Lord it is often discouraging
[time=1394] as I see how I measure up against your standard but your standard remains true, always there,
[time=1402] challenging my life and hopefully O God through my life challenging the lives of others.
[time=1409] Speak to us we pray through this message this morning in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1416] We are speaking these days on the subject of loneliness.
[time=1422] We have talked about the loneliness of the saints.
[time=1425] We have talked about how leadership often becomes lonely as we have discussed together the lonely servants.
[time=1432] Last week we had the opportunity to talk together about the loneliness that single people experience
[time=1439] and today I'm going to speak on the subject the lonely spouse.
[time=1446] Now I want to say before I begin this message that whenever I know I'm going to address a subject like this I always take great comfort in the fact that years ago while I was a student
[time=1457] in seminary one of my professors told me that it is not necessary when you address a subject
[time=1464] to be at the end of the road but it is critical that you be on the road.
[time=1471] I want it understood at the very outset that what I'm going to talk about this morning has in no way been totally mastered in my life but I want to acknowledge that I'm on
[time=1481] the road and that every day every week there is a part of me that struggles with what I'm
[time=1488] going to share with you today and if I could say anything at all that will be of comfort to other men who I hope are in the same struggle it is good to be in the struggle.
[time=1499] I think maybe that's one of the things that God can teach all of us we resent anything that upsets the equilibrium of our lives but God wants us to struggle.
[time=1508] I have used this illustration to explain it to others and it relates to the subject which we are addressing today.
[time=1514] When you sit in the control room of a radio station and you are responsible to gauge the sound that comes out from that control room your responsibility is locked up in a little meter called a VU meter.
[time=1527] You have three options with that meter.
[time=1530] You can peg it to the right by turning the volume clear up and you get ultimate distortion.
[time=1535] You can peg it to the left by never touching the volume and you get ultimate silence.
[time=1541] Or you can monitor it and see that it peaks in the red and you get balance and harmony and music.
[time=1548] What God has been teaching me in my life is this that is it relates to my marriage and the equilibrium in my home I have to always be watching the needle to make sure that it's peaking where it should.
[time=1560] It would be easy to turn it clear up and distort or clear off and forget but God has called
[time=1569] us to a ministry of monitoring and it is that truth that we will talk about today.
[time=1576] I'm speaking about the loneliness of the spouse and with all due apologies to the men my strongest
[time=1585] comments are reserved for you.
[time=1588] Not because you are the loneliest but because you cause the loneliness.
[time=1595] Perhaps it could be summarized in a letter that was sent to a well-known counselor some months ago addressed in the following way.
[time=1603] John and I were deeply in love when we got married.
[time=1606] We struggled during the first two or three years with our financial problems but I knew
[time=1614] he loved me and he knew that I loved him then something began to change.
[time=1619] I'm not sure how to describe it but it seemed to be wrapped up in the fact that he received a promotion about five years ago and that required him to work longer hours.
[time=1628] We needed the money so we didn't mind the extra time he was putting in but it never seemed to stop.
[time=1635] Now he comes home late every evening he's so tired I can actually hear his feet dragging as he approaches the porch.
[time=1641] I look forward to his coming home all day because I have so much to tell him but he never feels like talking.
[time=1647] So I fix his dinner and he eats it alone.
[time=1649] I've already eaten with the kids earlier that night.
[time=1653] After dinner John makes a few phone calls and he works at his desk.
[time=1656] Frankly I like for him to talk on the telephone just so I can hear his voice.
[time=1662] Then he watches television for a couple of hours and he goes to bed except on Tuesday when he plays basketball and sometimes has a meeting at the office.
[time=1670] Every Saturday morning he plays golf with three of his friends then on Sunday we're in church most of the day.
[time=1676] Believe me there are times when we go for a month or two without ever having a real in-depth conversation.
[time=1682] You know what I mean?
[time=1684] And I get so lonely in that house with those three kids climbing all over me.
[time=1691] There aren't any women in the neighborhood I can talk to.
[time=1693] Most of them have gone back to work.
[time=1695] There are other irritations about John.
[time=1697] He never takes me out to dinner.
[time=1698] He forgot our anniversary last month.
[time=1701] And honestly I don't believe he's ever had a romantic thought in his life.
[time=1705] He wouldn't know a rose from a carnation and his Christmas cards are signed just John.
[time=1715] There's no closeness.
[time=1716] There's no warmth.
[time=1717] There's nothing between us.
[time=1720] Frankly it's more than I can handle.
[time=1725] What that woman wrote to her counselor.
[time=1727] She probably thought was her own individual experience unfortunately.
[time=1733] It is representative of the experience of countless number of women.
[time=1738] Women perhaps as high as 90% of whom get divorces.
[time=1744] And later confessed that one of the reasons for it all was the unbearable loneliness
[time=1750] of living together but being far apart.
[time=1756] Someone has said that a man who treats his wife like that has guaranteed that they become a matched pair.
[time=1762] He works like a horse and she nags.
[time=1771] The result of that situation men and women is found in a number of responses.
[time=1778] Many women respond to that by getting an outside job.
[time=1780] They sublimate all of their energies that should be given at home and they find themselves involved in the job and they give everything they have to the job and somehow that makes it tolerable.
[time=1791] Some women frankly take their hostility out on their own husband by joining a militant women's liberation group and become very hostile toward men in general and just get all involved in striking out at maleness.
[time=1806] Some stay home and just get depressed.
[time=1811] Some have an affair.
[time=1815] Some crawl in a bottle taking alcohol or drugs.
[time=1821] Some commit suicide or at least attempt to commit suicide in order to get attention.
[time=1827] There is a growing number of women in our generation who are following the pattern of men of the past generation.
[time=1832] When they get fed up with it all they just get in the car and leave.
[time=1835] They leave husband and children and home and everything and they go off to get lost in this great big world of ours.
[time=1843] Unfortunately far too many get a divorce.
[time=1852] I suppose that among Christians what I am talking about this morning may be the best kept secret in the Christian Church.
[time=1859] For you see when we come to church on Sunday arm in arm people look at us and say my aren't they a lovely couple they must have a great relationship at home and they may have had
[time=1869] the biggest fight of the week on the way to church that morning over the fact that he was gone every night and they hadn't seen each other and there was no time.
[time=1877] The outer facade is never very good indication of the reality within.
[time=1884] Some years ago Edward Arlington Robinson described the secrecy of loneliness when he wrote this
[time=1891] poem about a lonely man.
[time=1894] He wrote whenever Richard Corey went downtown we people on the pavement looked at him.
[time=1899] He was a gentleman from soul to crown clean favored and empirially slim and he always
[time=1906] was quietly arrayed and he was always human when he talked but still he fluttered pulses when he said good morning and he glittered when he walked and he was rich oh yes richer
[time=1917] than a king and admirably schooled in every grace and fine we thought that he was everything
[time=1924] to make us wish we were in his place.
[time=1927] So on we worked and we waited for the light and went without the meat and cursed the bread and Richard Corey one calm summer night went home and put a bullet through his head.
[time=1941] If I've learned anything about people I've learned this that what you see on the outside is really very seldom related to what is within.
[time=1951] There are some of you who hear my voice today as I speak on this very sensitive subject not
[time=1957] even your closest friend knows how badly you hurt and how lonely you are but down beneath
[time=1963] that facade is a person who cries out because of the hurt of being a lonely person.
[time=1971] So I want to talk to you about that today and I want to address my comments specifically to the men and I want to segment the men to whom I speak.
[time=1981] There are some men who are here today who might as well turn your hearing off and not even listen.
[time=1988] You have already determined that your pattern is set you're not going to change.
[time=1992] You are in the truest sense a representation of male chauvinism even if you happen to be a Christian you could care less.
[time=1998] You're like the person who is described in a song called put a little log on the fire
[time=2004] it goes like this put another log on the fire cook me up some bacon and some beans and go out to the car and change the tire wash my socks and so my old blue jeans come on baby
[time=2016] you can fill my pipe and then go fetch my slippers and boil me up another pot of tea then put another log on the fire babe and come tell me why you're leaving me.
[time=2026] Now don't I let you wash the car on Sunday don't I warn you when you're getting fat ain't
[time=2032] I going to take you fishing someday well a man can't love a woman more than that ain't
[time=2040] I always nice to your kid sister don't I take her driving every night so sit here at
[time=2046] my feet because I like you when you're sweet and you know it ain't feminine to fight come on baby you can fill my pipe and go fetch my slippers and boil me up another pot of tea then put another log on the fire babe and come and tell me why you're leaving me.
[time=2062] I know some guys like that who if God himself came down and confronted them with where they
[time=2070] are wouldn't change because they don't want to and if you're in that group you have my
[time=2076] permission to go to sleep if you want to you can leave turn the TV off whatever because I haven't got anything to say to you but if you're a man like I'm a man who cares deeply
[time=2089] that I continue to grow in an area that in our culture is a great struggle then turn the volume up loud God has something to say to you the key verse in Ephesians 5 which
[time=2103] applies to all that we're talking about today is this husband's love your wives as Christ
[time=2113] loved the church it doesn't say husbands love your wives as you see love being portrayed
[time=2120] on the tube that is exactly at the opposite end of the spectrum from what God is talking about here he's talking about a kind of love that is only comparable to the love that Christ
[time=2134] had for his church and in this text he gives us some insight into that love that will help us as men to know what God expects of us as we try to love our wives and to dispel the
[time=2144] loneliness that so many of them feel because of our inattention there are five characteristics
[time=2152] of that love that I would encourage you to to observe with me as we study the text today
[time=2159] in Ephesians 5 first of all Christ loved the church realistically husbands love your wives
[time=2167] as Christ loved the church how did he love the church I share with you today in all earnestness
[time=2174] it was not romantic sentimentism the Bible does not say for God so felt sentiment toward
[time=2180] the church that he sent his only son the Bible says that he loved the church and that love
[time=2186] is a kind of love which does not keep score nor is it operation of performance one of
[time=2192] the things I've learned in talking with many people who struggle in their marriages is that they somehow got off love for love's sake love for each other's sake and they got
[time=2202] on the performance basis Tim Timmons in his book one plus one explains in detail how the
[time=2209] performance basis of marriage never works it is the kind of thing where a man says I love you because of what you do because of how you respond to me because of the things you do for me you stop doing them and I stop loving and so a woman has a kind of loneliness
[time=2226] that she can only explain to another woman the kind of loneliness that says I never feel like a measure up it's never good enough no matter what I do it never seems to measure up and so my my relationship with my husband seems to be a day to day up and down situation
[time=2241] if I'm good he loves me if I'm not he doesn't I want to ask you to do something for me right
[time=2247] now I want to ask you if Christ would have loved you as a part of the church knowing
[time=2255] what you are and what you are going to become if his love was conditioned upon that men
[time=2263] and women as I come to grips with what it means to love my wife as Christ has loved me I recognize that Christ loved me knowing full well everything that I would do to violate
[time=2273] that love and yet he loved me with an eternal love he loved me for all that he knew I was and he loved me in spite of that and because of that our love has got to be based on fact
[time=2285] not on fancy it is a love which includes faults and failures and all of the unlovely
[time=2292] and disagreeable elements that are part of each one of us and we love in spite of that and we love through that and that's the kind of love Christ had for the church and that's the kind of love he enjoins us to have for our wives one of the problems that many young
[time=2309] couples face in their marriages is the fact that they have set up very unrealistic expectations
[time=2315] of what marriage is all about and then they find out the truth where do they get those
[time=2321] unrealistic expectations from watching movies and watching television and reading romantic
[time=2328] novels and they feel like it is a happening they fall in love like falling in a hole accidentally
[time=2337] it's just sort of a magic thing some enchanted evening across a crowded room and then they
[time=2344] wake up in the first week and look across the table at curlers and no makeup and reality
[time=2350] strikes hard I think that one of the callings that we have as a church is to do away with
[time=2358] the surrealism that is developed in our culture about marriage in the family and to hold up God's standard which has nothing to do really with the external has everything to do with the beauty of the person and the inward man and ask God to help us to hold that standard
[time=2373] up so that our young people growing up will get a realistic appraisal of what marriage is and then they won't get bombed out when they when they get into a marriage situation and discover that what they thought it was what they heard it was what they saw it was
[time=2387] it wasn't secondly Christ love for the church was a sacrificial love notice what it says
[time=2395] in verse 25 husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it love
[time=2405] embodies sacrifice the Bible says that Jesus Christ counted the cost and he gave up himself
[time=2413] for us his love was not just sentiment his love was sacrifice his love was what it cost
[time=2420] him for us and so many today are trying to find a relationship that costs them nothing
[time=2426] they have their hands out all the time wanting to receive but never willing to give one lady said I find it easy to give everything in my marriage except one thing and that is in I can't give in and yet you see love and a relationship between a man and his wife is
[time=2444] a constant giving of themselves one to the other certainly the Bible teaches that wives
[time=2451] are to be submissive to their own husbands but in the same context it says submitting yourselves one to the other and marriage is a mutual submission one partner to the other
[time=2461] and the partner back it is a blending of ourselves together a giving of ourselves a determination
[time=2467] that we will sacrifice whatever we have for the sake of the one we love is interesting to notice that the word sacrifice is made up of two words sacra and physio sacra meaning holy and physio meaning to make and so it means to make holy and the Bible teaches that we
[time=2484] are to make holy at great cost the person that we love that means men that if we are
[time=2491] going to love our wives as we ought to love them if that love is going to be the means God uses to dispel the loneliness of their heart it will be a love that will cost us interests and time and pleasures and ambitions and friends and it will come to us at this
[time=2506] level that nothing has a priority over my wife no matter how important that may seem
[time=2512] to be one lady wrote when I asked my husband to spend time with the kids or with me it
[time=2524] always is tentative if I become pushy about it then he says I'm nagging honestly I never
[time=2532] wanted anything from him but himself and some part of him and you can only ask for so long
[time=2538] there's a limit to how long you can be ignored and put off you threaten to leave without meaning it until you keep the threat you consider all the unpleasant consequences until they don't seem unpleasant anymore you decide that nothing could be more unpleasant than being alone
[time=2551] feeling worthless you finally make up your mind that you are a person with real worth as an
[time=2559] individual you assert your ego and you join womanhood again that's what I did she wrote I wanted to be more than a housekeeper a diaper changer and a sex
[time=2571] partner I wanted to be free from the deep bitterness and guilt that slowly ate at my spiritual and
[time=2577] psychological sanity deep inside there was something making me not only dislike my husband but everything
[time=2583] he did and everything he touched his I love you became meaningless to me because he didn't act like it his gifts were evidence to me of his guilt because he didn't spend more time with me his advances toward me sexually were met with fragility that frustrated both of us and deepened
[time=2599] the gap between us all I wanted was to feel as though he really wanted to be with me but no matter
[time=2605] how hard he tried I always had the feeling I was keeping him from something
[time=2612] just once she wrote I wish he would have canceled something for us instead of canceling us
[time=2618] all of a sudden I woke up one day and realized that I had become a terribly bitter person
[time=2628] I had not only resented my husband and his work but I was beginning to despise myself in desperation to save myself our child and I guess even my husband I'd left him I don't think he really believed I'd
[time=2639] leave him I guess he never really believed I'd do it but I did
[time=2645] you say pastor that that's scary yes it is you see the unfortunate thing about such a
[time=2657] relationship where a man is totally inattentive to inattentive to his wife is the fact that sometimes he doesn't even know it Charles Swindall who is currently in his radio ministry speaking on the
[time=2670] home has made a very perceptive statement he said that homes do not come apart because of a blow out
[time=2679] but because of a slow leak little by little the interest and the care and the concern and the love
[time=2686] of a man for his wife sometimes a wife or her husband dissipates until there's nothing left
[time=2692] and at the bottom of all of that folks is this someone has refused to pay the price to keep the
[time=2700] relationship alive Jesus Christ loved his church with great sacrifice it cost him something and he
[time=2708] paid the price God is telling us that if we're to be what we ought to be in our homes men we have
[time=2715] got to pay the price Christ loved the church sacrificially then I want you to notice thirdly
[time=2726] that Christ loved the church purposefully notice what it says in verse 27 he loved the church that
[time=2732] he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[time=2738] that it should be holy and without blemish the purpose behind the love of Christ for his church
[time=2744] was the fulfillment and development of that church so that it could be all that he envisioned it to be
[time=2750] and the purpose and the goal and the motivation behind the love of a man for his wife is in order
[time=2758] that his wife might become all that she should be as a person quite opposed to the attitude of some
[time=2765] men who try to hold down any involvement or development or growth on the part of their life
[time=2773] they are threatened by any of her gifts or any of her abilities and so they do everything they can to stifle it they shut her down as a person until she begins to doubt her own worth
[time=2784] the bible teaches that a man who loves his wife will find his goal for that love in the
[time=2790] full development and maturity of his wife until she becomes all that she should be
[time=2796] and all that she can be and we are the facilitator to make that happen in the plan of God
[time=2804] and women may I say to you no matter what the livers say a woman never really finds fulfillment
[time=2813] in any other setting in terms of relationships like she finds when she has a good man who believes
[time=2821] in her and wants her to be all she should be and develops her and encourages her
[time=2827] and is a facilitator for her to become a mature person someone has retranslated a verse of the
[time=2835] scripture like this husbands love your wives but remember your love for God husbands love the
[time=2843] Lord thy God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and accept your
[time=2850] wife as God's gift to you and take care of her or someone else has translated a song we often
[time=2857] sing like this take my wife and let her be consecrated lord to thee that's not a bad motive is it
[time=2865] lord help me to be in the life of the woman that I love someone who develops her spiritually until
[time=2874] she is all she should be before thee our love as men should be a love with a purpose and that
[time=2884] purpose is the growth and development and maturity of that person who is living alongside of us Christ loved the church fourthly willfully
[time=2895] why did god love us because we were lovable oh absolutely not he loved us because according to
[time=2904] the scripture in his divine prerogative he will to love us one day in time past in eternity past
[time=2912] god said I will love and he did the common accepted idea about love today folks is that if you don't
[time=2923] feel like it you can't do it but that's totally apart from the truth the truth is this that feeling
[time=2931] follows action feeling follows the will if I want to I will and when I do the feelings follow
[time=2941] let me give you an illustration some of you who drive through the additions out here and along the highways see me churning along the street sometimes running I want to tell you something just to be very honest no matter what all the runners say not one time this year have I run
[time=2957] because I really deeply wanted to I never really get up in the morning and say wow I really feel
[time=2963] like going out and running this morning but you know what happens when I get my body going
[time=2970] and I start and I run because I've taken the action the feelings begin to come it feels good
[time=2981] and when you get home and you take the shower and and you're and you're relaxed and you and you know
[time=2987] you've done the right thing there is a euphoria about that that I can't express but if I wait until
[time=2994] I feel like doing it I never get it done and man the Bible tells us that Christ loved the church
[time=3000] because he wanted to because he willed to and the Bible teaches us that if we're to love as Christ loved the church we're to love our wives because we want to because we willfully choose to do it
[time=3012] that means that we take the actions of love even though you may not feel like doing it sometimes
[time=3018] let me ask you to do this if you feel like you don't love her as you want take her some flowers
[time=3027] now you better be sure there's oxygen on hand first but do it
[time=3036] now I guarantee you she'll like that she'll feel better because you did it but if you aren't all
[time=3042] the way gone if it's not too late for you if you're if there's no hope for you if there's hope for
[time=3048] you at all you'll discover something that you'll feel better for doing it and the love that should
[time=3054] be in your heart toward that woman will develop according to the activity of love that you're involved in Christ loved the church willfully and we are responsible as men to take the initiative
[time=3069] we are the leaders in love in our family last but not least Christ loved the church absolutely
[time=3085] it says in verse 28 we are to love our wives as our own bodies for many years as I studied this
[time=3092] passage of scripture and spoke on the subject to couples and and the young people I always thought this verse meant that we are to love our wives just like we love our own bodies that that's the
[time=3105] meaning of the verse until I studied it through again this time and I discovered that that's not what it means at all he is not telling us that I'm to love my wife in the same way that I love
[time=3116] my body he is telling me that I am to love my wife because she is my body I am to love my wife
[time=3123] because she is me she is part of me this text teaches that when you get married you become one
[time=3130] flesh and the Bible tells me as a husband that I am to love my wife and minister to her needs and
[time=3137] be concerned about her because she is part of me and just as I will not neglect any part of me humanly that hurts I cannot neglect any part of my wife that hurts because she is now part of me
[time=3151] and I am responsible and together we share a unity and a oneness
[time=3159] it is amazing to me how many women there are who hurt and hurt deeply whose husbands are not even
[time=3167] aware of it who when they sit in the counseling room and are confronted by the words of their
[time=3175] hurting husbands say well I had no idea there was anything like that going on I didn't know
[time=3182] why pastor I didn't know he felt like that I pray every day that God will help me as a man
[time=3191] to be sensitive to the hurts of my wife to be able to see when she's hurting over some problem
[time=3200] when there's something wrong in her life to be able to read it on her face or to sense it in her
[time=3206] spirit so that as I know her hurt I can reach out to minister to hurt
[time=3213] and to touch her life as I ought to
[time=3219] God wants us as men to take the initiative in expelling the loneliness that our wives feel
[time=3233] and we will have to count the cost to do it I'm grateful for some examples that God has brought into my life to demonstrate that that's possible I suppose I run the risk of embarrassing this
[time=3244] man if I tell you the story but since you know him I'm going to tell you his name is Bill Gather
[time=3250] he is a musician in our area and he's well known across the country for his contribution to music
[time=3258] Bill means a great deal to me in many ways but one of the most important ways that he speaks to my life
[time=3265] is because he has been willing to pay the price to make his home a priority when he was here in
[time=3275] Fort Wayne at a Thursday night concert he was illustrating his priorities Thursday night concerts
[time=3285] don't draw well and you pay a price when you have a concert during the week do you know why that
[time=3292] concert was on Thursday night because Bill determined that his children could not handle him being
[time=3299] gone every weekend Friday and Saturday there were events in the school that he needed to attend so he packaged all of his concerts up in two week periods in order that he might have the priority
[time=3312] of his home reflected in his life he paid for it I want to tell you something when he stands in
[time=3318] eternity that's going to look like the best payment he ever made men we have got to pay for it we have got to pay the price God help us to be willing to do it
[time=3330] for something that will outlive us in our business ventures and all the rest
[time=3337] and when we are in eternity we'll be glad we did shall we pray Father in heaven we pray that that which we have shared together in this service this morning
[time=3349] will be received with openness and and accepted as a word from God to our hearts
[time=3358] convict my own life in my need God and convict the lives of other men who are neglecting the most
[time=3370] important thing God has ever entrusted to them that partner that family use them oh God as the
[time=3379] priest of their home to be what they ought to be forgive us for our failures help us to recognize
[time=3387] Lord that because we have failed you are not through with us that you will help us to recover and go on and do what we ought to do to honor the our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed let me
[time=3398] ask you this question do you know Christ is your savior I mean have you trusted him have you put
[time=3404] your trust in him have you accepted that love that he has given to you through his death upon the
[time=3410] cross the love we talked about a few moments ago sacrificial love he loves you father mother young
