[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=31] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present The Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=40] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=60] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=68] - We begin our service with the singing
[time=74] of How Great Thou Art because that describes the focal point of our ministry and of our lives.
[time=80] We seek to honor and glorify Christ and to lift him up and to share him with everyone.
[time=86] And his wonderful word, which is the Bible, to teach it and express it and to help people understand it.
[time=93] For all of you who have joined us by television, it is our prayer that during this hour you will find help and encouragement and blessing that God will use this time to strengthen your lives.
[time=105] Our special guest today, who we'll be hearing from in a short time is Mr. Bert Kettinger.
[time=111] He'll be singing for us, but right now let's listen to the ministry of our choir as they can continue our praise by singing our great Savior.
[time=119] (piano music) [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=183] (piano music) [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=245] (piano music) (piano music) (piano music)
[time=253] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=323] - Thank you, choir, for continuing our worship of the Lord.
[time=335] That was great.
[time=337] Bert Kettinger is a good friend of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour Television Ministry.
[time=343] I tease him a lot about being the most relaxed singer I've ever known in my life.
[time=347] And in the early service this morning, I said he could sing in his sleep and I understand he misunderstood that that I said when he sings, he puts people to sleep.
[time=356] Now that's not the same thing.
[time=358] Bert is a very talented fellow with a great range, but most of all a great heart for God.
[time=363] He's always welcome here.
[time=364] He fits in and we're just grateful to have him back to share with us in music.
[time=368] - Bert, God bless you as you sing.
[time=371] (orchestral music) [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=597] - We're so very happy that you've joined us
[time=611] on the Bible Hour today, and we counted a real privilege to bring the ministry of God's Word and godly music into your home.
[time=620] We also think it's a really a special thing to be able to sit down in the middle of this time with you and share personally with our friends at home.
[time=627] Donna, my wife, and I appreciate so much the opportunity to talk on an informal basis with our friends at home.
[time=635] And most of the letters we get remind us of how special this very intimate time is with our people who watch every week.
[time=643] We have been encouraging our friends to get involved in studying the Word of God with us.
[time=647] We have developed a Bible reading fellowship which is spreading out across the country as people read through the Word of God each year.
[time=655] And the method that we're using is a very special and exciting method called The Daily Walk.
[time=660] It is a method which gets you into the Word of God and if you're faithful for a year, you will have read the entire Bible through from cover to cover.
[time=667] Donna, that is exciting and people are responding in a very special way.
[time=672] - Some people think that in order to read the Bible through in one year's time, it means maybe spending an hour or two a day in reading, but that really isn't true.
[time=681] If you just spend 20 minutes a day, you can read through the scriptures in one year.
[time=686] And I was looking at the new issue that just came out for the month of November and I thought you might be interested in knowing what's involved in a day's study.
[time=694] First of all, they give you the scripture that you were to read for that day and then they give you an overview of what you were going to be reading and some insight into that.
[time=703] Then they have a couple of paragraphs giving a little more detail of what you have studied and then down at the very bottom, they have a little paragraph called Insight and on November 14th, for instance, they give you some questions for you to interact with the passage and after you have read that passage, you should be able to answer those questions which are given to you at the bottom.
[time=725] This is just a very helpful tool to get you into the Word of God and make you think about what you're reading so that it's really beneficial to you, you're not just reading words.
[time=734] And we'd like to send you your free copy of the Daily Walk and if you'd like to have it, all you need to do is pick up your telephone and call us at our toll free number.
[time=743] That number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=748] You may call it any time during the week, just ask for the Bible our operator and tell her you would like to have your free copy of the Daily Walk.
[time=755] - Donna, along with the Daily Walk, we have been providing free to all of our listeners who will ask for it, a special little booklet called the Answer Book.
[time=764] During this particular time when I've been speaking on the subject of loneliness, this booklet has taken on greater meaning for many people.
[time=771] For instance, in a few moments I'm going to be preaching on the subject, the loneliness of suffering.
[time=776] If you have the answer book, there is a section in the book that deals with sickness and hurt.
[time=781] That section has all of the important scriptures that will speak to your heart about that subject so that you may mark it out in your booklet and know that when you're going through some difficult times, you can look up in the book, those verses, and God will use them to encourage and help you in your Daily Walk with him.
[time=800] We'd like to send the answer book to you, and once again, we've tried to make it just as easy as we possibly can to put this in your hands.
[time=807] There is absolutely no charge for it at all.
[time=810] We will send it free and postage paid to all who request it.
[time=813] And all you have to do is call us on our toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=820] And when you call, tell the Bible Hour operator that you'd like to have your free copy of the answer book.
[time=826] And when you're requesting the answer book, why not ask for the first edition of the Daily Walk?
[time=831] Both of these will be sent to your home this week.
[time=834] Donna, it's possible for them to write to us too.
[time=836] They don't have to just use the phone.
[time=838] Some of them may want to talk to us through the mail and close the communication cycle.
[time=843] So better tell them how to do that.
[time=845] - All right, if you would like to write to us, our mailing address is pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=856] And we do love to receive the letters in the mail because as Dave said, it does close the communication cycle and we get to hear from you.
[time=865] - Donna, I want to take just a moment to ask the people in the Dayton Springfield area, especially who are watching this telecast for one of the first times to sit down and write us and let us know that you're hearing and seeing us on channel 26 from Dayton Springfield.
[time=879] The only way we can justify the expansion of this television ministry into new markets is if we hear from people who are actually watching the telecast in that area, it's especially important that we hear from you who are in this new area of outreach for the Bible hour.
[time=893] Once again, you can get in touch with us at the toll-free number of 1-800-4539,000 or write to me, pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=904] Thank you for being a part of our service today.
[time=907] Just a few moments.
[time=907] We'll hear some more from Bert Kettinger.
[time=909] Then I'm going to be speaking on the subject, the loneliness of suffering.
[time=914] And I hope that you'll be with us as we share together God's Word.
[time=917] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=1163] - And that is a truth that if you know Christ is really very close to the heart of where you live, to know that Christ is all you need and that He does satisfy your heart and your life.
[time=1176] We have been studying loneliness during these days and one of the things we have learned is that God often uses the experiences of our lives to demonstrate the reality of His personal presence with us.
[time=1188] Bird is going to sing before the message is song that reminds us that when we enroll in God's wonderful school, He teaches us how to lean on Him.
[time=1197] Sometimes the experiences we have are a part of that schooling.
[time=1201] Listen to these words carefully.
[time=1202] They really prepare our hearts for what God wants to say to us from His word.
[time=1206] [MUSIC - 235 seconds]
[time=1446] - Hey man, thank you, Bert.
[time=1466] I want you to open your Bibles this morning to the 116th Psalm, Psalm 116.
[time=1473] And you follow in your Bibles as I read from mine
[time=1481] this wonderful portion of God's word, Psalm 116.
[time=1485] I love the Lord because He have heard my voice
[time=1491] and my supplications.
[time=1493] Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.
[time=1499] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold upon me.
[time=1504] I found trouble in sorrow, then called I upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1508] O Lord, I beseech thee deliver my soul.
[time=1512] Gracious is the Lord, and righteous, yay our God is merciful.
[time=1517] The Lord preserveth the simple, I was brought low and He helped me.
[time=1521] Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
[time=1526] For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears and my feet from falling.
[time=1531] I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
[time=1534] I believed, therefore have I spoken.
[time=1537] I was greatly afflicted.
[time=1538] I said in my haste, all men are liars, what shall I render unto the Lord for all of His benefits toward me?
[time=1546] I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1550] I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all His people.
[time=1555] Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.
[time=1558] O Lord, truly am I thy servant.
[time=1561] I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid.
[time=1564] Thou hast loosed, my bonds.
[time=1567] I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1571] I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all His people in the courts of the Lord's house in the midst of the O Jerusalem, praise ye the Lord.
[time=1582] Shall we pray?
[time=1583] Father, take this psalm that has so wonderfully described the suffering psalmist and his walk through the valley of hurt and difficulty
[time=1597] and cause that it shall be to us a message from on high to help us understand our own experience and the experience of others as well.
[time=1607] We pray in Jesus' name and for His sake, amen.
[time=1611] A few weeks ago, we started a series of messages on the subject of loneliness.
[time=1616] We talked about the loneliness of the saints, the loneliness of servants.
[time=1622] Two weeks ago, we discussed the subject of the lonely single and we talked about what it means to be all alone in life and be alone and lonely.
[time=1632] Last week, we addressed the subject of the lonely spouse and talked mostly to the husbands, have gotten so many words from the wives this week of appreciation that I said to their husbands what they didn't have courage to say.
[time=1649] One lady came and told me that on Sunday afternoon, she got flowers and she wanted me to know how appreciative she was of last Sunday's message.
[time=1656] Today, I want to talk about the subject of the lonely sufferer, the lonely sick person.
[time=1664] And this 116th psalm, better than any passage of scripture that I know of in the word of God deals with the emotions and the difficulties of being sick of suffering.
[time=1678] It's when the lights went out and the room was suddenly plunged into darkness that the awful awareness came, wrote a young lady.
[time=1688] The traffic of the hospital went on like an uncontrolled fever outside the door, but inside that room it became still, so still that you could sense, even believe that the walls were moving and the room was becoming smaller.
[time=1704] I was never a lonely person up to then, she wrote.
[time=1708] At least I don't recall being lonely, but now I knew what it was.
[time=1714] My family had gone home together to the familiar safe place, but I was here alone, isolated,
[time=1724] facing the uncertainties of what hospitals mean.
[time=1727] Up to this moment I had joked and laughed with friends and family because it all seemed like a lark, kind of a parenthesis experience in my life, but now I knew, and suddenly I swallowed hard.
[time=1744] Swallowed hard against the pressure in my chest.
[time=1748] I was a little girl again, wanting someone to put on a light somewhere to cut the darkness so I could get to sleep.
[time=1755] I became terrified by the feeling and sleep was a long time coming, hours of trying to push my mind off the emptiness, the fear and the darkness, and now the hospital itself slowly growing quieter, almost eerie, until there was only silence.
[time=1772] Those words written by a young lady who was in the hospital with a dread disease described something of the loneliness that people feel when they are called to go through an illness all by themselves alone, even though surrounded by family in the intimacy of their own person facing the difficulties of that experience before God.
[time=1796] Certainly David describes something of the characteristics of such an experience when he penned the words of Psalm 116.
[time=1804] As we look at this Psalm, we see some of the characteristics that he expressed having experienced them in his own personal life, characteristics that describe what happens when a person is sick when they suffer.
[time=1820] I want you to notice first of all that he does not avoid the most obvious part of suffering and that is pain.
[time=1827] He talks about the discomfort of sickness.
[time=1829] In verse three, he says, "The pains of hell got hold upon me." David said, "It hurt.
[time=1839] My sickness hurt." There was pain involved.
[time=1844] It was C.S. Lewis who wrote some years ago that God whispers to us in our pleasures.
[time=1852] He speaks to us in our conscience, but he screams at us in our pain.
[time=1859] He went on to say that pain is a megaphone that God uses to break into the deafness of our humanity so that we will hear him when he speaks.
[time=1872] David says that the pain of his experience was like the pain of hell and he said using very descriptive terminology, it grabbed hold of me and I couldn't get rid of its grasp.
[time=1882] I couldn't get free from its torture.
[time=1887] He goes on in the Psalm to talk about the despair which this brought into his own life.
[time=1893] In verse three, he talks about trouble and sorrow.
[time=1896] He says that this trouble and sorrow is the result of this pain that he has.
[time=1902] I found trouble and I found sorrow.
[time=1905] He is not avoiding the unpleasantness of the situation.
[time=1908] He goes on to tell us in verse eight that it is a despair which develops into a kind of depression.
[time=1915] Notice the verse that I've mentioned, verse eight.
[time=1918] "For thou has delivered my soul from death, "mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling." He's talking here about the anguish in the agony and the hurt of suffering and sickness.
[time=1930] And he is saying that it is a kind of agony that causes the tears to come to the eyes and to cause one to feel like they're losing their equilibrium, their feet are about to fall.
[time=1943] Emotionally, he is depressed and discouraged and down.
[time=1950] 43-year-old man who was taken to the hospital, fearing that he had cancer, wrote these words that describe in our present-day language what I think David was talking about in Psalm 116.
[time=1964] He said everything about me was on a chart.
[time=1968] I wasn't a name except when they had to remind themselves and check my wrist brand.
[time=1973] All of my body chemistry, its mixtures, was on that chart.
[time=1977] They knew what my blood was like, what pills I took and when, what my elimination habits were.
[time=1982] They even knew through a monitoring system how I breathed, how my heart reacted to every move.
[time=1988] All of what was supposed to be me was on a chart bound in the leather jacket.
[time=1994] But no one bothered to know me really that I was a gregarious person, a person who liked to laugh or no one asked what made me cry or if I liked to fish or go boating or what sports I enjoyed, what food I liked to eat, none of that was relevant.
[time=2010] I was not a person, but I was an object for sticking and probing and testing and experimenting.
[time=2017] They stood over me and they hummed or grunted or sighed or whispered in corners, but seldom did anybody tell me what it was they were discussing.
[time=2027] It all went on, my chart, but none of it went in my ears.
[time=2031] So I was left to my own imagination of what was wrong, how serious, whether it meant a life of inactivity with my job on the line or becoming a burden to my family.
[time=2041] After a while, I sank deeper into the doldrums.
[time=2043] I thought I was strong enough to lick anything that happened to me, but lying there day after day with my fears playing havoc with my mind and emotions, I was actually reduced to being a child.
[time=2054] And then he writes, "One night I let the tears come." That was a real shock.
[time=2061] To realize I had come to a place of such total helplessness, and despair, and anxiety that I had lost control of myself.
[time=2069] I have never been that seriously ill.
[time=2074] I've never been in the hospital.
[time=2075] God has given me good health, but I have been in the hospital with others strong, vibrant people who have gone through the experience that this man wrote about to the point of total depression and discouragement because they've lost control of themselves.
[time=2093] David continues to write in this Psalm about the characteristics of illness and sickness.
[time=2098] He talks about the dependence of it all.
[time=2101] I suppose for us who are men, that's the most difficult part of being sick.
[time=2105] Having been self-sufficient and independent and able to care for ourselves and to do for ourselves and for many others, all of a sudden we find ourselves in the hospital and we have someone waiting on us hand and foot, and at first it's kind of neat to be there and have someone caring for you like that.
[time=2121] But after a while you wish they would go away and just let you take care of yourself.
[time=2125] You don't want to see anyone who's coming to help.
[time=2128] You want to do it yourself.
[time=2130] And David is talking about this in the eighth verse when he talks about the fact that his feet were nigh unto falling, that he was totally apart from the ability to care for his own needs.
[time=2141] Someone has written that we spend our whole lives learning how to clothe ourselves for the sake of modesty.
[time=2152] Trying to find the best fashions to get dressed up.
[time=2155] Then we go to the hospital and it all unravels in the mockery of that horrible contraption called a hospital smock.
[time=2164] I had one man tell me the thing he didn't like about those hospital smocks was no matter where you sat down it was still cold.
[time=2171] Something about the way you are in the hospital
[time=2177] just tears your dignity right apart, doesn't it?
[time=2180] You can go in there the highest class person in the world and within 10 minutes you're as undignified as the least person in the whole ward, totally dependent, reduced to what you are as a human being and no more.
[time=2195] That's what David's talking about.
[time=2199] If you happen to be watching this television program in a hospital you identify with what I'm talking about.
[time=2204] Now this is not to say that our hospitals do not care properly for people.
[time=2208] We're blessed in this city with some of the finest hospitals I know.
[time=2212] But there isn't any way to preserve the dignity of an individual who is ill in a hospital.
[time=2218] It's just part of being sick.
[time=2220] Then he goes on in the same chapter to talk about the despondency that comes into the hard and life of an individual.
[time=2229] Notice verses 10 and 11 he says, "I was greatly afflicted." And then he confesses to refusing to believe the truth.
[time=2238] He says, "All men are liars.
[time=2239] No one tells me the truth." I know that some people I've talked to in the hospital come to the place where they no longer believe that they're getting the good truth from the people who are ministering to them.
[time=2251] They get so despondent that they can only believe bad.
[time=2255] And so when someone comes and says, "Well, you're looking better today," then no, I'm not, I'm not looking better.
[time=2261] You won't tell me the truth.
[time=2262] You're trying to keep me from the ultimate hurt.
[time=2264] And so they refuse to believe the truth.
[time=2267] David said, "I came to the place where I believed all men were liars," despondency.
[time=2273] One of the problems with a Christian who suffers, a Christian who has been brought up in the faith, is oftentimes the mental and emotional flogging that they give themselves during that period of time in their life.
[time=2289] I suppose if there's any one question that people ask me when I visit them in the hospital or talk to them about their illness, it's what have I done?
[time=2297] Oh God, what have I done to be in this place?
[time=2300] Why is God dealing with me in such a way?
[time=2303] Why has God taken this loved one from me?
[time=2305] Why has God brought this sickness to my life?
[time=2307] Why am I hurting so?
[time=2308] What has God against me?
[time=2311] And then if they're not careful, they begin to go back into history and dredge up all of the things they've done in the past that they shouldn't have done.
[time=2318] And they come to conclusion that God is dealing with them harshly now because 20 years ago they were involved in this, 10 years ago they did this.
[time=2326] And all of that comes back.
[time=2327] That's a message from Satan, my friend.
[time=2330] That's not from God.
[time=2331] I was reading recently the wonderful book that Joyce Landorf has written called "The Morning Song." I don't often recommend literature.
[time=2341] I'm told that when I do that, the bookstores are usually out of what we recommend by Tuesday.
[time=2346] And so it's not really fair to tell them that we're gonna do that or to do it without telling them.
[time=2352] But I do want you to know that there is a book that deals with grief and death, which in my estimation is the best book I've ever read from a spiritual perspective, and that's the book Joyce Landorf has written called "The Morning Song." In that book, she talks about some of the struggles people go through when they face death as a family, when they go through the pain of losing someone.
[time=2373] And the pain of agony, of losing a loved one, is quite similar to the kind of pain we inflict upon ourselves often through sickness and suffering.
[time=2383] In one of the chapters in her book, she relates to this whole matter of remembering sin and using that inwardly to flog ourselves and to try to make ourselves believe that because of our sin, we're in the situation that we're experiencing.
[time=2397] She does it very wonderfully through a simple poem that someone wrote goes like this, "I made a lash of my remembered sins.
[time=2408] "I wove it firm and strong with cruel tip.
[time=2412] "And though my quivering flesh shrank from the scourge "with steady arm, I plied the ruthless whip.
[time=2419] "For surely I, who had betrayed my Lord, "must needs endure this sting of memory.
[time=2426] "But though my stripes grew sore, there came no peace.
[time=2431] "And so I looked again to Calvary.
[time=2433] "His tender eyes beneath the crown of thorns met mine, "his sweet voice said, 'My child, "although those off remembered sins of thine "have been like crimson scarlet, they are now like snow.
[time=2447] "My blood shed here has washed them all away, "and there remaineth not the least dark spot, "nor any memory of them.
[time=2456] "And so should you remember sins, which God forgot?
[time=2459] "I stood there trembling, bathed in light.
[time=2465] "Though scarce my tired heart dared to hope, "his voice went on, 'Look at thy feet, my child.' "I looked in low, the whip of my remembered sins was gone.
[time=2476] "May I say to you that one of the most difficult things "for Christians to do who have been taught "from the word of God all of their lives "about the goodness of God and the blessing of God "in his provision is to accept the fact that sometimes, "for no reason other than their benefit "and God's glory, he allows difficult problems "to come into their lives.
[time=2498] "Dr. Charles Swindall, who is a friend of mine, "has written a book in which he talks "about the four spiritual flaws.
[time=2505] "It is a satire, a parody on the four spiritual laws "which the campus crusade has produced.
[time=2513] "And one of the four spiritual flaws "that he talks about in his book is this flaw, "that God never allows problems to come into the lives "of people who are under good sound Bible teaching "and are living godly lives.
[time=2527] "The Bible does not teach that.
[time=2528] "And Christian, if you are suffering, if you are sick, "if you're going through difficult times, "it could be because of sin.
[time=2534] "That's certainly a possibility, "but it is probably because God loves you enough "to want you to be all that you can be "and he's bringing you through some training "to make you mature in the faith.
[time=2548] "You know, the Bible says that whom the Lord loveth, "he chastised, and God's dealing in our lives "is often nothing more than an evidence of his love for us.
[time=2560] "And a recognition that we are his children "and he is demonstrating our sonship to us, "making us lichen to himself.
[time=2569] "The last characteristic of sickness is in this chapter, "and it's the characteristic of dread." Verse three, he talks of the sorrows of death.
[time=2577] Verse eight, he mentions death again.
[time=2579] Never does a person go into the hospital with any kind of serious illness, but what death is the ultimate dread that's in their mind.
[time=2586] We are put together in such a way humanly that when we get seriously ill, we always carry it as far as we can.
[time=2591] We assume the very worst.
[time=2593] And David is doing that in this psalm.
[time=2594] He is saying, "I'm going to die." Oh God, don't let me die.
[time=2598] What's wrong?
[time=2599] I don't want to die God.
[time=2600] He's talking about that in the psalm.
[time=2602] Those characteristics which were written hundreds of years ago are just as up to date as the closest hospital.
[time=2609] Talk to anybody who suffered or been sick, and they will tell you that most of the emotions I've described from this psalm are true.
[time=2615] In some way or another in their lives.
[time=2618] But I want you to notice that the psalm does not leave us there.
[time=2622] The psalm tells us how to respond to that whole situation in our lives.
[time=2626] And so we notice secondly the cry of sickness.
[time=2629] And we see this in this chapter as we look first of all in the first verse.
[time=2635] Because he hath heard my voice and my supplication.
[time=2640] Verse two, he hath inclined his ear unto me.
[time=2645] Notice that God is always available to the psalmist throughout the description of all of these characteristics which are listed in all of the psalm.
[time=2656] He cried unto the Lord and the Lord heard him.
[time=2662] Have you ever prayed with someone who's desperately ill?
[time=2668] There's something about the quality of that prayer that is summed up in the word beseech or cry.
[time=2675] There is a reaching out with the voice and with the spirit to lay hold upon a God almost as if to bring him physically into the room where they are.
[time=2684] David said that's where I was.
[time=2685] I cried for God, I reached out for him.
[time=2689] And three things happened.
[time=2691] Number one, God heard him.
[time=2692] That's right.
[time=2695] It says in verse one, he hath heard my voice.
[time=2702] Little four year old girl got hurt.
[time=2704] But she didn't cry for many hours.
[time=2709] In fact, she didn't cry until her mother came home.
[time=2713] Then she burst into sobs.
[time=2716] Someone who was watching all of this and had been aware of her injury said to her, but why didn't you cry when the injury first happened?
[time=2725] And she answered because there was nobody to cry to.
[time=2732] If I did not know Jesus Christ, there would be many times in my life when I would feel like that.
[time=2741] Who could I cry to?
[time=2742] I wanna tell you something folks, if you're a Christian, there's somebody to cry to.
[time=2747] And that someone is the Lord and he hears.
[time=2750] In fact, let me tell you how he listens.
[time=2752] Notice verse two.
[time=2754] It says not only does he hear with the ear, but verse two says he inclines his ear unto you.
[time=2760] Do you know what that means?
[time=2762] That's an all testament, Hebrewism, that means to lean forward with intensity in order to hear.
[time=2770] It's the picture of God if we could personalize it and make him a physical being for a moment.
[time=2777] It is God leaning over the banister of heaven, bending his ear close so that he can hear even the slightest nuance of your voice when you cry out to him.
[time=2786] God is not a dispassionate listener.
[time=2790] He is an intense listener waiting to hear your cry in the midst of your situation right now with your suffering and sickness and tragedy in the aloneness that you feel you are not alone for he listens and he wants to hear.
[time=2802] David goes on to say that not only did God hear him, but God helped him.
[time=2808] Verse seven says, "The Lord hath dealt bountifully with me." Now that's a wonderful word.
[time=2815] It's a word that finds its place in the New Testament more in the book of Corinthians than any other place, but it is a word which means over and above, more than we could ask.
[time=2825] It means that when I cry out to God and he hears me, when he extends his hand, there is always more in his hand than I ask for to begin with.
[time=2834] I don't understand that, but I know it's true.
[time=2839] It may not be exactly what you ask for, but it will always be better, and it will always mean more in eternity's viewpoint than anything you could ever dream.
[time=2849] He will help you, and then notice thirdly, the Bible says, "I cried and the Lord healed me."
[time=2858] Verse eight, verse eight says, "He was delivered from death." This summer while I was on vacation, I had the privilege, which is a privilege for a busy pastor to attend a Bible conference.
[time=2872] The Ocean City Bible Conference, a great place to share in the teaching of the Word of God from some great preachers from around the country, and I've never heard of this particular one who came on this particular Sunday.
[time=2883] His name was Anthony Campolo, an Italian sociologist in theologian who had a great deal to say.
[time=2891] And he was talking about the common and current idea that God is going to heal everyone, that it is the purpose of God to heal everyone from sickness.
[time=2901] He described some of the hurt that that philosophy brings upon people, because if they are not healed, they feel like it's because they don't have enough faith, or for some reason there's something wrong with them that God won't deal with them.
[time=2912] He went on to explain that it is obviously not God's desire nor purpose to heal everyone in this world.
[time=2918] But then he made this astounding statement.
[time=2920] He said, "But I want to tell you something, folks.
[time=2923] "It is God's purpose to heal everybody." And then he stopped, and I thought now he just contradicted himself.
[time=2933] But he added this, he healed some here, and he healed some up there.
[time=2938] And I thought to myself, I've known that truth, and I believe that truth, but I never heard it put so pointedly, that God wants to heal everyone.
[time=2950] He will heal some here, he will heal some there, according to his own plan.
[time=2954] And I couldn't help but wonder if that's why the verse that doesn't seem to fit in this chapter, verse 15, is inserted for our benefit.
[time=2963] I can't put it into the context or make any sense out of its relationship to the other verses, but it simply says, precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
[time=2972] Ultimately, he's going to heal them up there and make them all that they never could be here and cause them to be whole and perfect and one in his presence.
[time=2982] And so when someone who is a Christian faces the ultimate, which is death, separation of the soul from the body, separation from this life into the next, God looks upon that in a positive way for now he can do for that person, all that he will ever do for any who have put their trust in him.
[time=3000] David said, I cried and he heard, I cried and he helped, I cried and he healed.
[time=3005] Now the end of the psalm is the therapeutic part for those who suffer the loneliness of sickness.
[time=3014] For here are the conclusions of this sick man.
[time=3018] He introduces them with the question, verse 12, what shall I render unto the Lord for all of his benefits?
[time=3024] And then he answers with four great I wills in the psalm.
[time=3029] Four times he says, this is what I will do, number one.
[time=3033] I will remember my promises to him, verses 14 and 18.
[time=3037] Both of these verses are alike.
[time=3039] Verse 18, I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all of his people.
[time=3044] David has said, what I will do because God is with me in this experience is this.
[time=3048] I will remember my promises.
[time=3050] Have you ever noticed how many promises you make to God when you're hurting?
[time=3054] Oh God, you get me out of this mess and I'll do thus and this and all the rest.
[time=3059] I read recently that the night before a scheduled attack in a past war, there were soldiers who wrote letters to their parents.
[time=3067] The chaplain who censored the mail couldn't read them until after the battle was over and so he was going through the letters and when he did he found two letters that were in the same handwriting.
[time=3076] One pen before the war and one pen after the conflict.
[time=3080] In the first one, the young soldier was writing to his mother and these are the words of his letter.
[time=3085] I vow to God that if I come through tomorrow, I'm going to be a better man.
[time=3089] The second letter written in the same handwriting was written to his friend in another regiment.
[time=3095] I've just come through a scorcher up front if you can get leave, meet me in Paris.
[time=3098] Boy, will we paint the town red.
[time=3100] Isn't it surprising how quickly we forget what we promised to God when we're in the midst of trouble and difficulty and conflict?
[time=3108] David said, what am I going to do?
[time=3110] I'm going to remember my promises to God.
[time=3112] Number two, he said, I will render my love to God.
[time=3116] We can't go into detail here except to say that in verses one and two and nine and 16, David says in the midst of this situation, though I don't understand it all, I'm going to love God and I'm going to express my love to him tangibly.
[time=3131] He said, thirdly, not only will I remember my promises to God, not only will I render my love to God, thirdly, I will return my thanks to God.
[time=3140] Verse seven, notice what the psalmist says.
[time=3143] "Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, and how does he respond to it?" Verse 17, I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=3158] Throughout this entire series on loneliness, we have focused on one word more than any other and that's the word gratitude.
[time=3164] Can I, as a lonely person, whether I'm a single or a spouse or a saint, whatever, can I be grateful because gratitude more than any other attitude dispels the darkness of loneliness in a person's heart?
[time=3179] A little girl was taken to the doctor for a minor but painful operation.
[time=3183] The doctor who was a realist was trying to put her at ease and he said, if you want to, you can cry.
[time=3188] In fact, if you feel like a young lady you can scream, she looked up into the doctor's face and she said, is it all right if I sing?
[time=3196] And in her sweet cherub voice, she did just that
[time=3202] and she made it through.
[time=3203] God would teach us in our experiences of suffering and hurt that the one thing that will help us more than anything else is to look beyond the momentary problems and difficulties and gratefully acknowledge that apart from this, there is much that we have in Christ Jesus.
[time=3219] Last but not least, David said, I will receive the cup of salvation.
[time=3227] Notice verse 13, what shall I render unto God?
[time=3231] I will take the cup of salvation.
[time=3235] I will call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=3237] I have learned in the years of ministry that God has given me that oftentimes God takes tragedy and suffering and sorrow and sickness.
[time=3247] And he uses it as an arrow to the heart of a person who does not yet know God to cause them to look beyond themselves up into the face of an Almighty God and recognize that there is something missing in their life.
[time=3261] Last week, I had the privilege of being in a home with a young couple.
[time=3265] I've never heard it described so wonderfully as they described it.
[time=3268] The man said to me, I've got a great marriage, but something's missing.
[time=3272] We love our home out in the country, but something's missing.
[time=3276] I've got the best job you could ever have in my field, but something's missing.
[time=3281] Pastor, what's missing?
[time=3282] That's what God wants to bring us to in the midst of trouble and difficulty to help us understand the missing ingredient in our life.
[time=3291] A few weeks ago, as I was standing at the door of our church, someone came out the door and handed me a piece of paper.
[time=3297] I folded it up and put it in my pocket and just about forgot it until just a couple of days ago, I pulled it out and looked at it.
[time=3303] And this is what I read.
[time=3305] A letter from a Susan Leonard Johnson who died with terminal cancer in 1977.
[time=3310] These are her words.
[time=3311] When I was just a child of five and learned about my Lord, I never shouted prove it and I never felt ignored.
[time=3317] My hands were always folded in innocent belief.
[time=3320] It was easy to be humble, him above and me beneath.
[time=3324] There was no cause to question or to complicate this view.
[time=3327] And I'd often hear him whisper, oh my child, I love you too.
[time=3331] When I was one and 20 and learned about my world, how wise I'd grown, I'd outgrown God.
[time=3337] My future was unfurled.
[time=3339] Lord, you know me well, so I won't pray.
[time=3342] And I don't need you anyway.
[time=3345] How soon I'm one and 30.
[time=3347] Why is life such a bore?
[time=3348] I'm falling short in everything and everything's a chore.
[time=3351] I have so much, I've done so much.
[time=3353] This emptiness is wrong.
[time=3354] There is no God, my logic cries.
[time=3356] I knew it all along.
[time=3358] Lord, I doubt and cannot pray one with.
[time=3360] I will not be a hypocrite.
[time=3363] Now I'm four and 30 and the void is magnified.
[time=3365] I do not understand at all how desperately I've tried.
[time=3369] Disease has made its debut and I scream that it's unfair.
[time=3373] I'm only given one more year in sync and sheer despair.
[time=3377] My girls are small and I'm so young, they say there is no hope.
[time=3381] The fear is all consuming.
[time=3383] Please, someone help me cope.
[time=3385] Lord, could that be you, that knocks again?
[time=3387] Forgive me, Lord, oh please come in.
[time=3389] Gathering up the burdens, he said this about my strife.
[time=3392] You've been dead for over 30 years.
[time=3396] Now I'll show you life.
[time=3397] Today I'm five and 30.
[time=3402] What a blessed year it's been.
[time=3404] The fear has changed to utter peace.
[time=3407] There's happiness again.
[time=3409] What time unfolds, I do not know, but that's not my concern.
[time=3413] Once again, by grace, I humbly trust a precious lesson learned.
[time=3417] Lord, I give my all, myself to you, oh my child, I love you too.
