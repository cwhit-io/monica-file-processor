[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=49] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=55] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=84] It's a real privilege to welcome you to the morning service of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=91] Many of you who have joined us now by television.
[time=93] This is our second morning service, and we are so happy that we can begin this very festive
[time=100] day at the Blackhawk Baptist Church by listening to the music of our children.
[time=105] This is groundbreaking Sunday at Blackhawk.
[time=108] We are going to be leaving at the conclusion of the service for the new property, which the Lord has given to us in Arlington Park, and officially observing the groundbreaking
[time=119] in the beginning of that great project.
[time=122] Right now, let's listen to some joyous music from some very handsome children, the children's choir as they sing for us now.
[time=130] What kind of music does the rainbow make?
[time=146] What kind of song does it sing?
[time=1615] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1616] You know that song is the only reason why any of us have a chance to ever be used of God?
[time=1621] If it meant we had to be something other than ordinary, we'd all be in trouble, wouldn't we?
[time=1626] But God has chosen to use all of us just ordinary people.
[time=1630] And together, when we put our faith in Him and our trust in what He can do, God does wonderful things through these earthen vessels just ordinary.
[time=1640] But in God's hands, extraordinary.
[time=1645] Today I want you to turn in your Bibles to the Old Testament and the Book of Ezra.
[time=1651] And Ezra is back toward the beginning of the Old Testament.
[time=1655] I'm sure most of you haven't read much from Ezra this week, so you may have a hard time knowing where it is.
[time=1661] But it's a great book in the Old Testament that records an event that is very similar to what is happening here today.
[time=1668] Ezra and the third chapter.
[time=1672] And I'm reading from my Bible as I trust you will follow along in yours and listen to the reading of the Word of God.
[time=1679] And when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
[time=1688] Then stood up Jeshua, the son of Josodec, and his brethren, the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built at the altar of God to Israel.
[time=1697] To offer burnt offerings on it as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.
[time=1703] And they set the altar upon its bases, for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries.
[time=1709] And they offered burnt offerings on it unto the Lord, even burnt offerings morning and evening.
[time=1714] They kept also the Feast of Tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number
[time=1720] according to the custom as the duty of every day required.
[time=1724] And afterward they offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and of all who willingly offered a free will offering unto the Lord.
[time=1734] From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord, but the foundation of the temple of the Lord was not yet laid.
[time=1743] Now come down to verse 10.
[time=1746] And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of David, King of Israel.
[time=1758] And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the Lord because he is good for his mercy
[time=1764] and dearth forever toward Israel.
[time=1766] And all the people shouted with a great shout and they praised the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
[time=1772] But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers houses who were old men who had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy, so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people,
[time=1790] for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard far off.
[time=1796] I'm speaking today on the subject, the tears and the triumph of groundbreaking.
[time=1803] This Old Testament story is the record of the reconstruction of the temple
[time=1809] that was built first by Solomon, the great Solomon.
[time=1813] The history is as follows.
[time=1816] The return of the remnant of the Jewish people to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the walls and of the city and the temple itself are recorded in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
[time=1828] Ezra and Nehemiah in the Hebrew Bible are considered one book for they record basically all of the events that transpired during that period of time.
[time=1837] Now in the record that we have read this morning, we are coming into a period of time in history that needs to be supported with these facts.
[time=1846] Jerusalem in 587 BC fell to the Babylonians or the Persians.
[time=1854] Many of the Jews were taken captive and they went into exile.
[time=1859] Jeremiah, the prophet in the Old Testament, prophesied that it would be 70 years that they would be in exile and it was true right to the day.
[time=1867] During the time that they were deported and exiled, there came into power someone in the Persian government who became kindly oriented toward the Jews.
[time=1877] So at the end of that 70-year period of time, at 536 BC,
[time=1883] our story begins as we have read in the book of Ezra with a group of Jews going back to Jerusalem for the express purpose of rebuilding the ruined temple.
[time=1893] When the Babylonians came into Jerusalem and captured the city, they destroyed Solomon's great temple for it was a place which inspired the Jewish heritage and the tradition and courage of the Israelites
[time=1906] that were raised to the ground.
[time=1909] And so the Jews who went back under the leadership of Zerubbabel, who was mentioned in this text, went back with the express purpose of rebuilding that temple for the place of worship for the Jewish people.
[time=1921] Now there is a man who is very important in this story who has a name that is very difficult to pronounce.
[time=1927] His name is Zerubbabel.
[time=1929] And you better say it correctly and slowly or you will get it all mixed up.
[time=1934] As I was studying, that was the better of three titles that were given to him.
[time=1939] For earlier in the setting, we learned that his other name was Shesh Bazar and I would rather be a Zerubbabel any day than a Shesh Bazar.
[time=1948] When I found out that, I went a little further to discover that the title that was given to him by the Persian government as a governor was the title Tirishatha.
[time=1958] So the story today, which I would just encourage your heart, is about Zerubbabel Shesh Bazar who was the Tirishatha of the Jews.
[time=1967] Now just put that down on your paper and forget all about it because it has nothing to do with what we are going to say except you need to know the name of the man.
[time=1975] It was Zerubbabel who brought the Jews back to their homeland to re-establish their temple.
[time=1982] And the story of the re-establishment of that temple and the building up of that structure is the story that is so very similar to the event which we are celebrating today.
[time=1993] And as I read this and I saw all of the characteristics that describe that particular time in the history of Israel, I could not help but think that, well, the story was written for such a day as this, and that we ought to read it with understanding and rejoice in its truth as it is applied to what we do today on this very special day in the history of our church.
[time=2013] Let us notice the characteristics that surrounded that great event when the temple was restored in Jerusalem.
[time=2020] First of all, you cannot read far in the text before you realize that for the Jewish people they placed a great priority on the Scripture.
[time=2029] The first characteristic of that event is this, the priority of the Scripture.
[time=2034] Now there is a phrase which is found here in the text on two occasions which underscores that priority.
[time=2041] Notice first of all in verse 2 of chapter 3.
[time=2044] Then stood up Jeshua, the son of Josodek, and his brethren, the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and build the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it.
[time=2055] Now here's the phrase, "As it is written." If you look down in your Bibles to the fourth verse, you'll discover that they kept also the feast of the tabernacles as it is written.
[time=2069] The people of Israel who went back to their holy city to rebuild their temple were people who placed a great priority on the Old Testament Scriptures.
[time=2079] And what they did on that day, they did because of their knowledge of the Word of God.
[time=2085] There is a passage, for instance, in the book of Deuteronomy in the 12th chapter, which talks about the importance of the sacred place of the temple.
[time=2094] A passage of Scripture which encourages the Jews when they get into their homeland to immediately restore that temple to its proper place.
[time=2103] For there, in that place, they would to worship God and to offer their sacrifices.
[time=2108] And in the Jewish religion, as they related to their God, the sacrifices, and the burnt offerings, and the altar, and the labor, and all of those accouterments of the temple were very crucial to their worship.
[time=2121] And so, if they did not have the place, they could not worship their God as they were accustomed.
[time=2126] And God instructed them that they were to take great care for the sanctuary in which they worship the God of Heaven.
[time=2133] These Jewish people were not the ordinary, normal reactionaries.
[time=2139] They were Jews who carried in one hand the implements of building, and in the other hand, the Old Testament law.
[time=2146] And it's interesting, even as we read this story, to discover that they were very cognizant of the Old Temple.
[time=2152] For the Scripture says that when they restored the temple, they actually found the place where the old altar was and they built the new altar on the base of the old altar.
[time=2163] They had studied it all out.
[time=2164] They found out exactly how everything fit together, and with the Bible as their guidebook, they went into that place and they established that building.
[time=2173] Now, today's situation is not quite the same, and yet it certainly is a tremendous opportunity for us to apply this to our own lives.
[time=2183] We know that the Church of God is not a building made with hands.
[time=2188] What we are to construct in Arlington Park is not God's Church.
[time=2192] It's simply the place where God's people meet.
[time=2194] The Church is made up of all of us who are born again believers, who are a part of the body of Christ.
[time=2201] But may I say to you today that all that this Church has ever done and all that it means and all that it's involved in is summarized by that statement that we place a priority on the Word of God, and it is our purpose to do as it is written in the Scripture.
[time=2217] On a number of occasions, I've been asked as the pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church to try to explain to folks why the Church has grown so rapidly over these past ten years.
[time=2228] There are many reasons for that.
[time=2230] First and foremost, I'm sure are the people of the Church who are zealous for God.
[time=2235] But certainly among those things which has made this Church what it is is the priority that the Church places upon the Word of God.
[time=2243] One of the things that people notice when they come here to Church, almost immediately is that the people who worship here regularly come with a Bible in their hand, ready to open it up to study what God has to say to them.
[time=2255] Now certainly we can talk about many things in the world and many social needs that are crying out to be met.
[time=2262] But we happen to believe that the purpose of the Church is in order that it might declare the Word of God.
[time=2268] That's the one thing that makes the Church unique from all institutions in the world.
[time=2273] There are other institutions that can speak to the social needs and we must speak to them as they come to us from the Word of God.
[time=2279] There are other institutions that can be involved in the political questions.
[time=2284] We must speak to them as they come to us from the Word of God.
[time=2287] But our priority men and women as a Church is the declaration of the Scripture, thus saith the Lord.
[time=2294] And I find as I talk to people today, by and large, they're hungry for that.
[time=2299] That's what they want to hear.
[time=2301] That's why they go to Church.
[time=2303] They're interested in hearing something from God, something that can minister to their life from the Word of God that can make a difference in where they live every day.
[time=2312] They're tired of lectures that they could receive at some club.
[time=2315] They want something from God's Word to encourage their heart.
[time=2319] And just as in the Old Testament Temple, they had a priority on the Scripture.
[time=2324] I say to you today that in this Church, in this day of dedication and new beginning, we must re-evaluate and recommit ourselves to a priority on the Scripture.
[time=2337] The second thing I noticed is I studied this story that is certainly appropriate for us to mention on this day is this.
[time=2344] It is very easy to see that this was a group project for you notice immediately the participation of the saints.
[time=2353] Notice verse 1, a very special phrase, and I like the way it's described.
[time=2359] It says that when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together, notice as one man to Jerusalem.
[time=2369] That is a very beautiful way to describe the unity of the people of Israel who were involved in this project.
[time=2376] The Scripture says when they came together, they came as if they were just one person.
[time=2381] One person coming to the task to do it.
[time=2383] There was no division, there was no difference of opinion.
[time=2387] They were together as one person in the ministry to which God had called them.
[time=2391] They were convinced of the importance of their unity.
[time=2395] I notice as I read the Psalms over and over again, the theme of unity that David uses in writing those great Old Testament songs.
[time=2404] It seems such as Psalm 133 that says, "Behold how good and how pleasant the thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." One of the blessed treasures of our church is the unity that we have together in the cause of Christ.
[time=2420] That doesn't mean that we never have differences of opinion.
[time=2423] If someone once told me that if you have two people together and they both agree, one of them is unnecessary.
[time=2429] And that's probably true.
[time=2431] When you have this many people together in a congregation, if we all agree exactly about everything, it would be a very dull life.
[time=2438] I want to tell you something, when it comes to the priorities of the ministry and the purpose of the church, we stand together as a congregation in unity, believing God together for the great things He has called us to do.
[time=2450] That unity is something to be excited about.
[time=2452] Just as in the Old Testament, they came as one man to that project.
[time=2456] Today as a congregation, we gather as one man to the beginning of this great project God has put in our hands to do.
[time=2464] It's not hard to discover that unity has been a part of all of the great things God has ever done.
[time=2469] For instance, in the New Testament, when we read about the beginning of the church in the second chapter of the book of Acts, when the Holy Spirit came and the church began, in Acts chapter 2 and verse 1, we read that when this day came, they were all with one accord in one place.
[time=2485] So great was the unity of that day, according to the Scripture, that the result was that the church was baptized into the body of Christ.
[time=2493] Three thousand souls were converted on that day.
[time=2496] The church was edified and the name of Jesus Christ was lifted up and it was the beginning of the most dynamic movement the world has ever known, which is even alive and well today in the form of the church, which is visibly present here today, unity.
[time=2512] But I want you to notice that they were not only unified as it related to their purpose, they were unified as it related to their plan.
[time=2520] Now, when we come together and we say it is our purpose to build a building, that's one thing.
[time=2527] But I don't know if you know anything about independent Baptists, but I'll tell you, when you get a group of independent Baptists together, you got as many ideas as to how to do it as you have people.
[time=2536] Here were a group of people.
[time=2537] Here was a group of people that were committed not only to their purpose but to their plan.
[time=2541] Let me show you a key word in the text that's very interesting.
[time=2544] It's the word together.
[time=2547] I love it.
[time=2548] Chapter three verse one.
[time=2550] The people gathered themselves together as one man.
[time=2554] Chapter three verse nine.
[time=2556] Joshua and his sons and his brethren and his sons, the sons of Judah, together set forward the workmen in the house of God.
[time=2563] Chapter three verse eleven.
[time=2565] And they sang together by course in praising God.
[time=2569] Chapter four verse three describes what happened when the enemy started to attack them.
[time=2573] And we read in chapter four verse three that they said, "You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God, but we ourselves together will build a house." I think there's something very great about togetherness.
[time=2588] About being in something together with God's people.
[time=2592] Not only being unified in the purpose of it, but being unified in the plan of it and together going forward.
[time=2599] Let me say something to you.
[time=2600] If we're not together in this project, we are in deep trouble.
[time=2604] It is going to take all of the faith of every one of us combine and multiply to the furthest limit if this project is ever realized in our lifetime.
[time=2615] And the togetherness of the unity of God's people just as it was in the Old Testament is critical to us today.
[time=2623] We must be together.
[time=2628] I think it would be good for us to stop for just a moment and take a brief mini course in unity.
[time=2639] I'd like for you to turn in your Bibles to the fourth chapter of Ephesians.
[time=2646] Ephesians 4 gives to us in my estimation the key to unity in the body.
[time=2655] I am not sharing this because it is a present need and I feel we are not unified.
[time=2661] I'm sharing it because the best way to keep from being broken in our unity
[time=2669] is to declare the truth of it and understand what makes it happen.
[time=2674] Now in the fourth chapter of the book of Ephesians, we are taught about unity.
[time=2678] Notice verses 4, 5 and 6.
[time=2680] There is one body, one spirit, called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father.
[time=2688] You get the impression that that's talking about oneness.
[time=2692] The word one in the Greek language is the little word uni.
[time=2696] It is a word, a derivative of the word unity.
[time=2699] So those three verses are talking about unity.
[time=2701] The unity of our oneness in the Lord, our oneness in faith, our oneness in baptism, our oneness with God, unity.
[time=2708] It's what it's talking about.
[time=2710] You say, "Pastor, how do you get that unity?
[time=2712] How do you preserve that unity?" Well, let's read the text backwards.
[time=2716] Look up in verse 3.
[time=2718] Verse 3 says, "You get the unity and you keep it by endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." I remember the day when I first read that and understood what it meant.
[time=2729] And it dawned on me that having unity in a church was an endeavor.
[time=2734] I have learned over 11 years that the most time consuming and emotional part of being a pastor is the endeavor to keep the unity of the saints.
[time=2746] You've heard about the Christian who said, "To love the whole world for me is no chore.
[time=2756] The only real problem is the guy next door." I know people like that.
[time=2761] To love the saints who live above, "Oh, that will be glory." But to love the guy who lives below, that's a different story.
[time=2769] A lot of Christians don't know how to get along with each other.
[time=2773] Even though they love the Lord, they have differences of opinion.
[time=2776] Now, the Bible says if you're going to keep unity among people, it's work.
[time=2780] You have to endeavor to do it.
[time=2782] And you know, that's not fun work.
[time=2784] There's kinds of work that is fun work and there's other kinds of work that's work work.
[time=2788] And that's work work.
[time=2790] It means going and sitting down with someone who's had a disagreement and trying to put it all back together and say, "Now, brother, you need to understand what this man said and you need to understand what this man said and put it all together." It's important. It's work. It's an endeavor.
[time=2802] But now, how do you do the endeavor? How do you do the work?
[time=2806] Let's read one more verse backwards.
[time=2808] Here's the key to the whole thing.
[time=2810] With all loneliness and meekness and long suffering, for bearing one another in love.
[time=2817] Do you know what the enemy of unity is in every situation?
[time=2822] I don't care whether it's secular or sacred.
[time=2826] Do you know what destroys oneness in any organization?
[time=2829] It is the ugly sin of pride.
[time=2835] You do away with pride and you re-establish unity.
[time=2837] And that's why Paul, when he was teaching the Ephesian Church, taught them that in order to keep the unity of the faith, they needed to do away with pride and develop loneliness and humility.
[time=2848] And they needed to learn how to forbear one another, which means to put up with each other.
[time=2854] And all through the Bible we are taught over and over again
[time=2860] that principle of loneliness and humility and loving and forbearing unity.
[time=2866] The participation of the saints.
[time=2869] Now thirdly, I want you to notice that in this text which talks about the groundbreaking of the Old Testament temple, there is not only the priority of the Scripture and the participation of the saints, but we also have the principle of sacrifice.
[time=2883] Back in the book of Ezra in chapter 2 verses 68 and 69, we are told that this project got started in the following way.
[time=2892] Some of the heads of the fathers, when they came to the house of the Lord, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place.
[time=2899] They gave, after their ability, into the treasury of the work, three score and 1,000 grams of gold and 5,000 pounds of silver and 100 pre-scarments.
[time=2910] The project was inaugurated by the sacrifice of the people who were involved.
[time=2918] Just as this project was started through the sacrifice of the people involved, who about two years ago committed over and above their regular giving to the ministry of this church, $1.1 million, which was used to get the project started
[time=2934] in purchasing the ground and getting the architect doing the drawings.
[time=2938] There is no such thing as a project of magnitude that honors God without sacrifice.
[time=2945] The other day someone said to me, "Pastor, wouldn't it be wonderful if someone would just give you $10 million as a gift to build that building, get that thing finished?" I have to admit that I dreamed about that for a little bit.
[time=2959] Then I began to realize that would be the worst thing that could ever happen to us.
[time=2963] You see, that which costs us nothing means nothing.
[time=2969] And unless this building is a part of all of us and the sacrifice of each of us,
[time=2975] it's worthless. It is something that belongs to someone else that we enjoy.
[time=2981] Now I think the Lord would allow someone to give $1 million or $2 million.
[time=2986] I just don't think someone ought to give it all. You understand what I'm saying?
[time=2991] So I don't want the previous announcement to discourage anyone who may have been thinking along those lines.
[time=3000] I remember the first time it dawned upon my heart as a leader that there is no feast without a sacrifice.
[time=3010] You know, there can't be an Easter without a good Friday.
[time=3015] You can't really have a decent product without the process.
[time=3019] We all want to get in on the joy of the blessing and somehow if we can escape the sacrifice that makes the blessing worthwhile in the first place.
[time=3030] I think it's a part of our culture today. It's the welfare syndrome, if you will.
[time=3034] Everybody gets something for nothing, but you don't really ever get anything for nothing.
[time=3041] And I want to tell you something, the sacrifice that we have already been involved in is just the beginning.
[time=3046] Whatever it is that God has force in the future is going to involve what we have done and much more.
[time=3053] The project by its magnitude is far beyond anything we can personally do as a church
[time=3059] unless all of us are doing all we can do at the very limit of our ability in sacrificial giving.
[time=3065] And that's the way it ought to be. David of the Old Testament said, "I won't offer to God that which costs me nothing. I won't do it. It's not worth it."
[time=3075] I want to give God something that's meaningful and costly.
[time=3078] And many of us have entered into that and will continue to understand that in the days ahead.
[time=3083] Do you know when the temple was being built, there were two preachers on the scene.
[time=3088] One by the name of Hagai and the other by the name of Zechariah.
[time=3091] They wrote books in the Old Testament which you've probably never read, but I just want you to know they're there.
[time=3096] Hagai was a firebrand of a preacher. He used to preach some of the greatest sermons to these people.
[time=3103] And when you get a chance sometime, you read the sermon he preached recorded in the first chapter of his book.
[time=3108] You know what he did? He was a brazen guy.
[time=3111] He got up in front of the congregation and he told them about how plush their houses were.
[time=3116] She said, "You live in all these plush, paneled houses." And then he visually said, "Now, I want you to think about your plush houses.
[time=3124] Now I want you to think about the house of God which is laying in ruins." And then he poured guilt on them like you wouldn't believe.
[time=3131] And he said, "How dare you live in houses that are paneled in plush and flourish." And the house of God lies in waste.
[time=3139] One of the greatest stewardship sermons I have read in my life.
[time=3143] He motivated his people to understand the importance of sacrifice in doing what God does in building a work.
[time=3152] Much more that I could say about this Old Testament project, but let me jump with you quickly
[time=3159] to verses 10 through 13 of the third chapter, where we come to the actual celebration.
[time=3165] I remember when I read this thinking about our groundbreaking Sunday.
[time=3170] And I thought to myself, you know, we do a lot of good things in the Baptist Church.
[time=3174] We teach the Bible and all of that.
[time=3176] But the one thing we don't do very well if you really want to know the truth is we don't celebrate very well.
[time=3181] We're so afraid that we're going to go overboard.
[time=3185] You know, somebody says an amen and just scares them right out of it.
[time=3188] You know, they just don't know what to do with it.
[time=3190] I've watched that happen in the church.
[time=3191] Someone will come in and get real excited and I'll say something that even I think is pretty good.
[time=3195] And a guy will say amen and a guy next to him jumps.
[time=3198] Good night. What was that?
[time=3202] But you know, in the Old Testament, they knew how to celebrate.
[time=3206] When they got a project together and it was time to really get excited about it, they did it right.
[time=3211] Now the Bible tells us that they got together and they sang and they gave thanks unto God.
[time=3216] And they had trumpets and they shouted.
[time=3219] And at the end of the text it says, everybody was involved.
[time=3223] The old people and the young people.
[time=3225] The old people cried and the young people shouted.
[time=3228] The old people wept because they remembered Solomon's temple and what it was.
[time=3233] They had been little children when that temple had been in its prime.
[time=3237] And they had walked around and seen its splendor and its glory.
[time=3240] And I hate to say this, but Zerubbabel's temple wasn't quite Solomon's temple.
[time=3245] It was smaller. It wasn't quite as plush. It wasn't quite as big.
[time=3248] It didn't have all the gold in it.
[time=3250] And these old people remembered the good old days.
[time=3254] And they said, oh my, this is not ever going to be like it was back in the good old days and they cried.
[time=3261] And once in a while I hear somebody say that around here.
[time=3264] Pastor, I remember how it was back in the good old days.
[time=3269] I just don't know where they're coming from because they're talking about being back in those mobile units.
[time=3274] The good old days with frozen pipes.
[time=3278] The good old days with heat that didn't work.
[time=3281] The good old days where the nursery and the wonderful aroma from the nursery permeated the whole building.
[time=3289] Oh, I remember the good old days, but I'll tell you something.
[time=3293] I have no desire to go back to the good old days.
[time=3296] And maybe we can fix up something for those of you who are lingering on in memory so that you can enjoy all of that.
[time=3302] And we'll allow you a few tears for the past, but folks, let's rejoice for the future.
[time=3308] And let's shout, enjoy, and get excited about what God has done.
[time=3313] In a few moments we're going together on the property that God has provided for us.
[time=3317] And we're going to rejoice together.
[time=3319] We're going to do some things that Baptists don't usually do.
[time=3323] We're going to have some fun.
[time=3327] Amen, right.
[time=3331] And I hope that you'll just get all of your dignity and forget about it for a little bit.
[time=3336] When somebody gives you a balloon with helium in it, don't talk to them about why we don't do that in the Baptist Church.
[time=3342] You hang on to it and don't let go until I tell you.
[time=3347] And when I tell you, let go.
[time=3351] And we're going to sing and we're going to talk together because this is a great day in the history of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3358] It is a day for which we have prayed and worked and labored and asked God and we have agonized about it.
[time=3366] And we have some of us gone through a Gethsemane experience that would rend your heart and today is the celebration of the beginning of a new chapter in our church.
[time=3377] And men and women, it's all right to be happy about that.
[time=3380] You know what?
[time=3383] Let the liberals be long-faced.
[time=3385] Let's be happy.
[time=3390] And I believe God will be honored.
[time=3394] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[time=3399] And let that joy be the strength which carries us on into the project with the excitement and joy that will make it a reality.
[time=3409] Amen?
[time=3410] [AMEN] Let's pray.
[time=3412] Father, we just dedicate these next moments to thee.
[time=3418] We are aware of the fact that what happens today will be looked back upon as a great day in our lives and in our history.
[time=3428] Father, I give thanks to you for these wonderful people.
[time=3431] People who have believed you and trusted you.
[time=3434] People who look the impossibility of this all right in the face.
[time=3438] And in spite of the obstacles, say, we will build.
[time=3442] We will go ahead.
[time=3444] We will trust God for the impossible.
