[time=0] (bell ringing) From the Convocation Center
[time=28] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=36] (music playing)
[time=60] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=76] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=89] And we welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=93] This is Friend Day here in our services.
[time=96] And in this second hour, once again, we look out over an auditorium with almost every seat filled and people are still coming in.
[time=104] This is a day we celebrate twice a year when we reach out in a very specific way to invite all of our friends to be with us here in our services.
[time=113] I want to say a word of welcome to all of you who are visiting with us.
[time=117] We trust that this will be an hour of blessing and encouragement to each and every one of you.
[time=121] We have as our special guest today, a group of young people from the Western Baptist College and they'll be singing for us in a few moments.
[time=129] Right now, let's listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=133] (orchestral music)
[time=151] [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=344] - Thank you, Quire, for that ministry, an encouragement to our hearts to hear in music of the one ship we have with our Lord and the Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=352] It's been a few years ago now that we had a man on our staff here at the Black Oak Baptist Church who was the head of the music ministry by the name of Peter Kobe.
[time=361] Peter used to be a music teacher here in the state of Indiana years ago and then went out to the West Coast and was involved in Christian education there serving with us for two years.
[time=375] God called him back to the Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon where he is now the chairman of the music department and one of his specialties is the training of groups of young people who go out across this country to sing and to share the story of Christ representing the college.
[time=393] Some of you know the president of Western Baptist College.
[time=396] He is Dr. Tom Younger who was the former Baptist preacher who pastored the Emmanuel Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=404] It is with real joy that we welcome Peter and the master's touch singing group to the Black Hawk Baptist Church and to the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=413] I know they're going to be a blessing to your hearts.
[time=416] (soft music)
[time=430] [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=624] - We're so very glad that you've joined us for the Bible Hour today, and I'm privileged to have my wife join me for this time when the offerings being received here in our auditorium gives us an opportunity to talk to the friends at home.
[time=635] Now, Donna, I know you have some things you wanna share about the daily walk and a letter that you receive, but before you do that, let me say just a word to our friends at home about a special letter that I sent from my office to many of the homes of this area and where the television program is being seen.
[time=650] It's a special letter about the importance of the Founders Club.
[time=653] Now, the Founders Club is a group of specially committed people who stand behind the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=660] If you've been watching the Bible Hour for very long, you know that we're quite different from a lot of ministries in that we spend the entire time on the air preaching the Word of God and singing the praises of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=672] Very, very little time is given to promotion and to fundraising.
[time=676] We believe that the time that we have on the air belongs to the Lord and to God's people.
[time=681] On the other hand, however, we still have to meet the same responsibilities that every ministry on television meets.
[time=687] And so we do that as we communicate to people through the mail.
[time=690] You've received a special letter from me this week asking you to consider being a part of the Founders Club.
[time=696] And I hope that as you receive that letter, you haven't put it aside, but that you'll read it carefully and that you'll consider what God would have you to do to join with us in the ever expanding family of men and women who give regularly to the ministry of the Bible Our Television Program.
[time=712] And for all of you who are already members of the Founders Club as you're able to increase your monthly commitment and as you stand with us regularly, we want to say thank you.
[time=721] And God bless you for the part you're having in reaching out to many people through the Bible Our Television Ministry.
[time=726] Now down and now that that's out of the way, I want you to tell our friends at home about a very special tool that we've developed to help them get into the Word of God and grow.
[time=735] - One of the purposes of the Bible Our God from the very beginning has been to encourage people to get into God's Word because that's where the answers are.
[time=744] The only answers that we have to give are those that we get from the Word of God.
[time=749] And you can get them for yourself if you'll just spend time daily in God's Word.
[time=753] We've been encouraging people to read through the Bible in one year by means of using the daily walk.
[time=759] And we received a letter this week which I'd like to share with you.
[time=763] This individual writes, "I am thankful for the daily walk.
[time=767] It has helped me read the Bible every day.
[time=769] And I will be thankful to have read the entire Bible by the end of the year." It's a thrill to get letters like that from people who have not previously had a consistent daily time with the Lord.
[time=781] And many now are as a result of being involved in the daily walk program.
[time=786] If you would like to have a free copy of the daily walk, all you need to do is call us at our toll free number.
[time=791] And that number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=797] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her you would like to have your free copy of the daily walk.
[time=802] And we'll get it in the mail to you right away.
[time=804] - Donna, along with the daily walk, we are always making available to our friends at home special editions of scripturally organized booklets that help them to be more effective in their Christian walk.
[time=816] For many weeks now, we've been sharing the answer book, a special book of topically arranged scriptures to help you as you try to meet the need in your own life and in the lives of other people.
[time=826] This answer book is yours free for the asking.
[time=829] All you have to do is call us or write to us and request it.
[time=833] And if you are not now using the daily walk and you would like to have the daily walk and the answer book, simply request it when you call our toll free number.
[time=840] Once again, that number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=844] It's an absolutely free call from any place in the United States.
[time=847] All you have to do is pick up your phone and dial.
[time=850] And when the operator answers the phone, ask for the Bible our office and she will give you the right person to get all the information so we can send this material to you this week.
[time=861] Thank you so much for being a part of our service.
[time=863] This is a very special day here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, its friend day.
[time=867] And from all over this area, many, many friends are coming to share with us in these special services.
[time=873] We're also very happy to have with us our old friend Pete Coby and his ministering group, The Master's Touch.
[time=878] We'll be hearing more from them in just a moment.
[time=881] Then I'm going to open the word of God and share a very special message on the subject of loneliness as we continue that series.
[time=887] God bless you as you share with us in this hour.
[time=890] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=1069] - The Master's touch has two young people
[time=1078] who sing in that group who really belong to us by prior claim.
[time=1082] They are not prepared for this, but I think before they sing, we ought to hear from either Ed or Marcia Rickert who used to be in the Sounds Alive back when we had our group on the road.
[time=1095] And I think I know them well enough to know that Marcia will bow to Ed.
[time=1098] So Ed, why don't you just say a word about what's going on?
[time=1101] And I think the camera can get you if you just hold your mic up so they know which one you are.
[time=1105] Tell us a little bit about what you're doing and then sing for us again before we have the message this morning.
[time=1110] - Some time ago, after Pete left to go to Western, Marcia and I got married after the former group that was with the Sounds Alive.
[time=1119] And we left and went to Modesto, California where we both held jobs and we'd kind of been praying that the Lord would lead in our lives to give us another ministry that we could work for him and travel in another full-time group maybe or do something for him because at the time I was working nights, she was working days and we weren't able to really do much for the Lord in the way of ministry and do the things that we were equipped to do.
[time=1143] So not long after that, we'd been married about a year and a half and Mr. Kobe gave us a call up there at Modesto or down there.
[time=1150] And he said, you know, would you like to be the road managers of this group?
[time=1155] And we thought and thought and it was a tough decision but we said yes.
[time=1159] And we were really glad we did.
[time=1161] We've been traveling since June 1st when we first met and worked in camps all summer.
[time=1166] So we've gotten kind of broken in that way.
[time=1168] We're kind of at the midway point in our ministry and we just thank the Lord for the opportunity he's given us to worship and to minister with the Master's Touch.
[time=1174] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 306 seconds]
[time=1492] - Thank you, young people.
[time=1500] These kids are good, aren't they?
[time=1502] I know where I'm going to be tonight at seven o'clock.
[time=1506] They're going to be singing here in our services this evening at seven o'clock.
[time=1510] And those of you who are living locally and want to share in a great time of music need to be with us tonight for the Master's touch.
[time=1518] Now I want you to turn in your Bibles to the Book of Matthew, the first gospel in the New Testament.
[time=1524] And I want us to look together in the 27th chapter of the Book of Matthew.
[time=1530] I'm reading in the 27th chapter, beginning at verse 45.
[time=1535] So I hope you brought your Bibles. If you didn't, your neighbor will share his or hers with you.
[time=1540] And you can look along in your Bible as I read from mine.
[time=1544] Matthew's gospel, chapter 27, verses 45 through 49.
[time=1550] Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
[time=1557] And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice saying, Eli, Eli, Lamasabakthani.
[time=1566] That is to say, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[time=1573] Some of them that stood there when they heard that said, this man calleth for Elijah.
[time=1579] Straightway, one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on the reed and gave him to drink.
[time=1586] The rest said, let be.
[time=1589] Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.
[time=1593] Let us pray together.
[time=1596] Our God in heaven, we ask that you will give understanding to our hearts and minds as we opened thy word together today.
[time=1604] We pray that this very poignant passage of Scripture,
[time=1611] which describes a moment that is beyond our human comprehension, will come to be understood in each of our minds at least a little bit better than before.
[time=1623] Most of all, we pray that with the understanding we have of that moment, we shall take the action in our own lives that we'll be pleasing unto thee.
[time=1634] We'll give you the praise in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1639] For the past several weeks, we have been studying together in the ministry of our church,
[time=1645] the subject of loneliness.
[time=1647] We titled the theme, "Loneliness, the Disease of the Decade." I was with another preacher this week from the West Coast who deals in writing and in speaking
[time=1658] to the needs of humanity, and he said, I got the advertisement about the series, and I want you to know you're right on, because in my estimation, the disease of the decade is the disease of loneliness.
[time=1671] The beginning of this series, we talk together about lonely Christians, what it means to be a Christian in a day when the world does not acknowledge you as a person of worth because you accept Christ.
[time=1685] We talked about the loneliness of leadership, what it means to walk that lonely road
[time=1692] without anyone to confer with, about the needs that you have, and to be standing out in front while the rest follow behind.
[time=1701] Three weeks ago, I gave a message on the lonely single, and how difficult it is to be a single in the world today that caters basically to couples and families.
[time=1712] And then two weeks ago, we talked about the lonely sufferer, what it's like to be sick in the hospital,
[time=1718] what it's like to suffer all alone when no one understands what it's all about.
[time=1723] Today, we continue that theme with what I consider to be the loneliest verse in all of the Bible.
[time=1731] If I had to pick a verse of Scripture that describes in some way what it's like to be lonely
[time=1737] and multiplies that loneliness to its greatest denominator, I would say that the verse which we have read from the Scripture today describes the awful agony of being alone
[time=1749] better than anything we could ever read in the Bible.
[time=1752] It is a verse of Scripture which is a record of our Lord's death.
[time=1757] It is the fourth word of the seven words from the cross.
[time=1762] It is the central word in the seven, three come before it and three behind it.
[time=1767] It is a word from the lips of the Savior which defies our understanding and comprehension.
[time=1775] When in that lonely hour, hanging between heaven and earth, he cried out in agony, Eli, Eli, Lamasabakvanai, which translated into our language is,
[time=1788] "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=1794] There is no experience in life through which men pass so terrible,
[time=1802] so awful as that of the silence and mystery of this hour.
[time=1807] An hour when there was no voice and no vision and no sympathy, no understanding, no response,
[time=1815] there is no agony for the human soul like the agony of the silence of this moment that the Son of God experienced our Savior.
[time=1825] The Scripture says, "He cried out being forsaken." He said, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Is there any other word in human language which has in it sadness and poignancy like the word forsaken?
[time=1846] Have you ever been to a town that has been forsaken by its inhabitants?
[time=1850] Out west along the great expanse of the highways, here and there are towns which once flourished,
[time=1856] but have been forsaken by their inhabitants and they stand as a testimony as a mausoleum to what was life?
[time=1864] It's an awful picture of sadness and silence.
[time=1869] Do you know what it's like to minister to people who have been forsaken by the dearest and nearest one to them?
[time=1875] A husband forsaken by his wife, a wife by her husband.
[time=1880] This past week, I visited in the home of one of the families in our church who care for foster children.
[time=1887] And I sat at the dining room table after supper as they told us the story of some of the children who had been forsaken and abused and misused by their parents.
[time=1896] The tears came to my eyes as I heard the record of cruelty in the hearts of parents who were forsaken
[time=1902] and misused their children. Is there anything worse than a child forsaken by its parents?
[time=1909] Men are forsaken by their friends.
[time=1913] But there is something that goes beyond all of the human experience that I've described, and that is the experience of a creature forsaken by his creator, a man forsaken by his God.
[time=1927] And here is the Son of God hanging on the cross at Calvary crying out that he has been forsaken by his father, by his God.
[time=1937] If you study the life of the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament Gospels, you will learn quickly that the relationship between Jesus Christ and the Father was one of intimate fellowship.
[time=1947] The Lord Jesus said that his father was his daily delight, that he spent time with his father.
[time=1953] There was never a moment when they were out of fellowship.
[time=1956] They communed together one by one.
[time=1961] And the Scripture says that there was never a thought that Jesus had that was out of harmony with the Father.
[time=1966] There was never a desire in his heart that was out of harmony with the will of the Father.
[time=1972] They enjoyed unbroken communion.
[time=1975] And yet at this moment in time, in this central point of history, Jesus Christ said,
[time=1981] "I have been forsaken of my God and of my Father," and he asked the question why.
[time=1987] During those days that preceded Calvary, the soldiers had mocked him, but he never answered a word.
[time=1995] During that hour when he was mistreated, they pushed a crown of thorns down upon his head,
[time=2001] and the blood spilled out over his brow and down over his face, but he was silent.
[time=2008] They beat him, and they scourged him, but he answered not a word.
[time=2012] They spit on him, and they plucked out his hair.
[time=2016] He never said anything.
[time=2018] They took his clothes off of him, and they let him hang there on the cross in naked shame.
[time=2023] Not a word came from his mouth.
[time=2026] They pierced his hands and his feet.
[time=2029] The crowd that gathered around taunted him, and even the thieves that hung to either side of him, and one of them railed on him and accused him of being unjust as he hung there for the sins of the world.
[time=2041] In response to everything that men could throw at him in that awful hour, Jesus said nothing to the men.
[time=2053] But in that moment when all of the wrath of an almighty holy God was centered on him as he represented the sin of the world,
[time=2061] Jesus cried out, not in his accustomed way, my father or holy father as we find in John 17,
[time=2069] but he cried out, "Oh God, God, why have you forsaken me?"
[time=2076] I find this truth to be almost incompatible with what I know from the Word of God.
[time=2081] For the Scripture teaches us that God is a God who never forsakes his people.
[time=2086] In the Old Testament as the Israelites, for instance, were in Egypt under the bondage of the Egyptian government.
[time=2091] There in the midst of that awful oppression, God did not forsake them.
[time=2096] As they finally were extricated out of that bondage and were headed toward the Promised Land, they came to the Red Sea and the enemy was behind them and the sea was before them.
[time=2106] But God did not forsake them. He was there and he parted the water for them.
[time=2110] Three Hebrew children stood one day in the midst of a fiery furnace.
[time=2114] In the Scripture records that in the midst of that fire, there was one like unto the Son of God.
[time=2119] He did not forsake them. And yet here, where we have more bondage than in Egypt,
[time=2126] where we have more threat than at the Red Sea, where there is more fire than in the furnace,
[time=2132] Jesus Christ hangs upon the cross and he cries out, "I'm forsaken of God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=2141] Abandoned by God. When the Scripture through the prophet David said, "I have never seen the righteous forsaken." We see on the cross, the righteous of the righteous, forsaken of Almighty God.
[time=2158] Why did God do that? Why in that moment of history did he turn his back upon his own beloved Son
[time=2167] so that that communion and that relationship was broken and Jesus hung there alone
[time=2173] in the loneliest moment of the world?
[time=2176] I could not pretend to answer that question completely.
[time=2180] I am told that when Martin Luther was studying that truth in the New Testament, that one day as he was struggling with what it meant and walking about in his garden, he cried out loud, "God forsaken by God, who can understand it? I can't.
[time=2199] I can't comprehend what it all means, but there are two or three things that it teaches us that we must not miss.
[time=2206] May I say to you this morning that if we come to grips with the meaning of this text and of this passage,
[time=2212] it has the potential to despair the awful loneliness in the heart of mankind.
[time=2220] If we can come to understand what God was doing in this moment, if we can come to grips with what that means to us, it can take the curtain of loneliness and draw it aside to let the light of God's love come in and fill our lives
[time=2234] so that loneliness is not that experience we once knew.
[time=2237] For I personally believe men and women that the loneliest person, the loneliest man, the loneliest woman, the loneliest young person is that person who is without Christ,
[time=2249] who is alone without His God.
[time=2252] We learn from this passage of Scripture, first of all, something about the penalty of sin.
[time=2258] Do you know what the Bible teaches us?
[time=2261] I learned this verses a little boy, Romans 6, 23, the wages of sin is death.
[time=2270] I remember the wordless book that taught that message and the little pictures on the flannel graph that told us that sin
[time=2277] brings forth death.
[time=2279] The wages of sin is death, and I'm sure, like many of you, I thought that that meant that because Adam and Eve sinned in the garden, that death entered into the human race, and because of their sin, now everybody dies, and that's true.
[time=2292] But oh, let me tell you, there's much more to it than that.
[time=2296] When the Bible says that the wages of sin is death, it teaches us a truth that we must understand if we're to understand what happened on the cross, say what is death?
[time=2309] Is it the awful silence after the last breath is drawn?
[time=2315] Is it the ghastly pallor over the face?
[time=2318] Is the blood ceases to flow through the veins and the eyes remain motionless?
[time=2326] Certainly that describes physical death.
[time=2332] According to the Bible, physical death is a moment when the soul and the spirit leave the body.
[time=2337] The separation of the body from the soul and the spirit, Paul said in the New Testament, absent from the body, present with the Lord, he was talking about the moment of death.
[time=2347] Death is separation of the body from the spirit and the soul.
[time=2350] That's physical death, but the Bible teaches that there is another kind of death, one that few people understand that's far more important to know about than even physical death.
[time=2361] The Bible says there is a spiritual death, and that's what he's talking about in Romans 6.
[time=2366] Spiritual death is the separation of the soul and the spirit from an Almighty God.
[time=2372] It is a time when we no longer have fellowship with God because of sin in our lives, because we have been doomed and damned by an Almighty God who refuses to traffic with sin in the life of people.
[time=2387] On the cross, the Lord Jesus was receiving the wages which were due you and me.
[time=2392] You say, "Pastor, what do you mean by that?" The Bible says that because I am a sinner, now I don't have any question about that.
[time=2399] I know that's true. My wife knows that's true. My children know that's true.
[time=2404] People who are around me know that's true, but most of all God knows that's true.
[time=2408] I'm a sinner.
[time=2409] And the Bible says that because I am a sinner, I cannot have fellowship with the Holy God.
[time=2414] He does not look upon sin lightly.
[time=2416] In order for me to fellowship with him, I must have something that will bridge the gap between me and him over the chasm of sin in my life.
[time=2425] And the Bible teaches that he was the one who bore our sin in his body on the tree.
[time=2432] He took the penalty for my sin.
[time=2435] And if sin brings forth death, and if death is the separation of the soul from God,
[time=2442] then if Christ was to pay the penalty for my sin, he must suffer the separation of his soul from God.
[time=2449] And so in that awful moment when he cried out, "Why have you forsaken me?" He was reminding all of us that he really did.
[time=2457] He truly did pay the penalty that we deserved.
[time=2460] He was separated from his father as the penalty for our sin in that awful agony, in that awful moment.
[time=2468] I believe with all of my heart that Jesus Christ suffered hell for me.
[time=2475] All of the agony of torment and all of the agony of punishment.
[time=2480] You say, "How could he have done that in three hours?" Let me remind you that he was the sinless Son of God.
[time=2486] He was the infinite God, and the infinite God came into a period of time compressing his infinity into three hours.
[time=2494] And in those three hours his infinite death was enough for all mankind as he was separated from his father.
[time=2501] Now I can look up into the face of God in heaven.
[time=2505] Not any more righteous, intuitively than I was before, but in the righteousness of Jesus Christ the penalty has been paid.
[time=2513] Mass say to you people that someday the judgment of separation from God will be the plight of all those who have rejected him in this life.
[time=2523] You say, "Where does the Bible say that?" In 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 and verse 9 we read these words, "Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord?"
[time=2537] I don't know all that there is to know about hell.
[time=2541] In fact, as you know folks don't even like to talk about that today.
[time=2544] The only time you hear it is in a swear word.
[time=2547] And when somebody that you don't like is consigned there by a friend or a foe.
[time=2553] But the Bible teaches that there is a literal place called hell.
[time=2557] The Bible teaches that.
[time=2559] And if you want to believe in heaven you have to believe in hell because they're in the same Bible.
[time=2563] You can't have one without the other.
[time=2566] And I don't know all that there is to know about hell but I do know one thing that the Bible is very clear about and it's this.
[time=2571] That hell is a place where there is the total absence of God.
[time=2576] The total apart from God.
[time=2579] Total separation from God.
[time=2581] Where there is no influence, no fellowship, no communion, no anything that relates to God.
[time=2586] Where God is absentee.
[time=2590] And someday men and women will stand before a holy God and if they have not accepted His plan in Jesus Christ.
[time=2597] He will say, "Depart from me, I never knew you." But you see Jesus made all that unnecessary.
[time=2606] When He died upon the cross and He hung there separated from His Father, He paid the penalty so that we wouldn't have to pay it.
[time=2614] He took upon Him the price that is exacted from each one of us and now we can put our trust in Him and not have to pay the penalty that is due us.
[time=2627] This is the penalty for sin that Christ was separated from His Father.
[time=2634] But I want you to notice secondly that here is the program of salvation.
[time=2638] This phrase, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is the simple plan that God provides for those who will put their trust in His Son.
[time=2648] Let me tell you two things about God.
[time=2651] First of all the Bible teaches He's holy.
[time=2654] That means He's just, perfect, absolutely without sin.
[time=2657] In Him there is no darkness, no not even a shadow.
[time=2660] He is absolutely 100% perfect holy.
[time=2665] And because of that He cannot have any fellowship with darkness or sin.
[time=2670] He judges sin wherever He sees it, wherever He touches it He must judge it.
[time=2675] He is a holy righteous God.
[time=2677] And I want to say to you that we don't hear much of that today.
[time=2680] We hear all about God's love and we have set Him up in His grand heaven as a doting-o grandfather who pats everybody on the head and says, "Well, that's alright."
[time=2689] But He's a holy God.
[time=2691] The Bible teaches that.
[time=2693] I'm so excited too that He's a loving God.
[time=2696] He's a merciful God.
[time=2698] And just as He judges sin, mercy flows out from Him to all who will receive it.
[time=2703] I used to tell folks when I share the gospel with them that because God is a holy God and a loving God, it almost seems when you try to comprehend Him that He's in a box.
[time=2713] How can He get out?
[time=2715] How can He say, "I love you, I hate your sin"?
[time=2719] How can He do that?
[time=2721] Well, He devised a plan that's the miracle plan of salvation.
[time=2725] It's the only plan that would ever solve that dilemma.
[time=2729] And here it is.
[time=2730] One day in time passed, He looked at His perfect Son, Jesus.
[time=2734] And He said to Him, "My Son, because of the sin of the world, I cannot bring my children to heaven.
[time=2741] And so I am going to send you there to walk among them as a man and ultimately in sinless perfection to go to a cross and there to die.
[time=2749] And when you die to take upon you the sin of all the world, suffering the penalty for every man.
[time=2755] And because you will pay the penalty, I can be a just God.
[time=2760] And say to those I love, the penalty has been paid.
[time=2764] If you will just accept what's been done for you, you may come to be with me forever in heaven."
[time=2771] That's the plan of salvation.
[time=2773] And that's what was going on that day when Jesus cried out, "Why have you forsaken me?"
[time=2779] We call it in the language of theology, substitution.
[time=2784] The wages of sin is death.
[time=2787] Because I am a sinner, I deserve to die.
[time=2790] If I suffer physical death, I lose my life.
[time=2794] If I suffer spiritual death, I'm separated from God.
[time=2798] So if I have sinned and the wages must be paid, and I'm going to be with God in heaven, somebody else has got to pay the wages.
[time=2806] And that's what Christ did when He went to the cross.
[time=2808] He paid my penalty for me so that I wouldn't have to pay it.
[time=2815] Someone has written that because God judged sin on His Son, He now accepts the believing sinner in His Son.
[time=2825] That's the way it works.
[time=2827] God took my sin, He put it on Jesus.
[time=2830] And He took Jesus' righteousness and put it on me.
[time=2833] And He said, "Now, you can come into my heaven." One day as a 17-year-old boy, I bowed my head and I said, "Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner." And that I cannot save myself.
[time=2843] And so today, because of what you did on the cross for me, I reach out by faith to accept your plan and to become your child.
[time=2850] I've never been sorry.
[time=2852] It's been a grand and glorious experience to know for sure that I'm headed for heaven, not because I'm good, but because I've accepted what God did for me.
[time=2862] He suffered in our stead.
[time=2864] He saved His people, thus.
[time=2867] The curse that fell upon His head was due by right to us.
[time=2873] The storm that bowed His blessed head is hushed forever now.
[time=2880] And rest divine is mine instead, while glory crowns His brow.
[time=2888] He bore my sin.
[time=2890] He bore yours.
[time=2892] God's claims against me have all been settled.
[time=2896] Somebody else paid the bill, Jesus Christ.
[time=2901] There's a young man in our church who's only been a Christian in a short time.
[time=2904] His name is Jim Hutchins.
[time=2906] He used to come to church every Sunday, sit here in the auditorium and listen to the message.
[time=2910] And he had a video cassette player at home.
[time=2912] He had set the timer and then he'd go home.
[time=2914] I was so, so hard to understand that he had to hear me about four times before it made any sense.
[time=2921] So he had listened to it over and over and over again, tried to get it all down.
[time=2925] One day I went to his house and I began to share the claims of Christ.
[time=2928] Told him how he could know Christ is his Savior.
[time=2930] When I got all done presenting the gospel, he said, "Pastor, let me see if I've got this right." He said, "If I understand what you've said, here's what I comprehend.
[time=2939] God took all my paybacks and put them on Jesus and I get in free." I said, "Man, that's it.
[time=2946] That's it.
[time=2947] That's the gospel.
[time=2948] God took all of our paybacks and put them on Jesus." And he paid the penalty so that we can come in free without having to pay it.
[time=2958] That, my friend, is the program of salvation.
[time=2962] And so when Jesus hung upon the cross forsaken of his father, he was forsaken.
[time=2970] That we might enjoy his presence forever.
[time=2973] He entered into darkness that I might walk in light.
[time=2978] He drank the cup of woe that I might be able to drink the cup of joy.
[time=2984] He was forsaken by his father that I might be forgiven.
[time=2990] Isn't that a wonderful story?
[time=2993] That's the simple, easy-to-understand gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2999] You say, "Pastor, it's too easy." Wouldn't it be like God to make it that way?
[time=3004] God is not prejudiced.
[time=3006] He didn't make a gospel for the elite, for the intellectual.
[time=3009] He put it down on the bottom shelf where all of us could get ahold of it from the littlest of children.
[time=3014] My five-year-old daughter accepted Christ just two weeks ago because she understood that God loved her
[time=3020] and Jesus died for her and all she had to do was invite him into her heart and she could be a Christian.
[time=3026] The program of salvation.
[time=3028] Thirdly, when Christ cried out, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[time=3034] He demonstrated beyond all contradiction that he loves us.
[time=3040] It's the proof of his love.
[time=3042] I have a message for all of you today.
[time=3044] Please listen carefully.
[time=3046] Will you listen?
[time=3048] God loves you.
[time=3050] He really does.
[time=3052] That's not just theological jargon.
[time=3055] Not some good thing to say when you see people in church.
[time=3058] Not a motto for a ministry.
[time=3060] It's the truth.
[time=3061] God loves you.
[time=3063] You say, "How do you know that, pastor?" He took the best thing heaven ever had.
[time=3069] The greatest possession the world has ever known.
[time=3072] His sinless son, his only begotten son.
[time=3075] He wrapped him up in a package of love and he sent him down to this earth and he made him die a death of torture and agony
[time=3083] so that you could go to heaven without paying the penalty.
[time=3087] Is there any other love that's greater than that?
[time=3092] The Bible says, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man laid down his life for his friends."
[time=3099] Do you know what it meant for Jesus to lay down his life?
[time=3102] It meant that this pure Son of God had to walk into the vile den of iniquity bearing all the sin of all mankind.
[time=3112] This week I was told a story of a little baby whose parents so mistreated the child that the father took the feet
[time=3121] of that child and beat its head against the wall.
[time=3126] And I couldn't believe it.
[time=3128] The child will never be right again.
[time=3131] As I studied this passage of Scripture, I realized that whoever that person is, however bad that is, Jesus died for him.
[time=3140] Jesus took that awful heinous sin upon him, the pure Son of God, and the price of our redemption was paid
[time=3148] that Jesus identified himself with such as that, and all of the rest of us too.
[time=3155] And he says to all of us having paid that price, come.
[time=3160] The price has been paid.
[time=3162] The way has been made open.
[time=3163] All you have to do is reach out by faith and accept what I've done.
[time=3167] Accept my plan.
[time=3169] Receive me into your heart.
[time=3171] Express your faith in me by prayer, say yes, I do take what you did for me on the cross as my hope of heaven.
[time=3177] I receive your payment for my sin and your gift of eternal life, and you can go to heaven.
[time=3182] You can know it today.
[time=3184] You don't have to wait till you get there.
[time=3186] God has advanced reservations.
[time=3190] Friday night.
[time=3192] It must have been around midnight.
[time=3194] I know I was dead asleep.
[time=3196] The phone rang.
[time=3197] It was a chaplain at Parkview Hospital, and he said, "Pastor, we have a family here that needs your help."
[time=3204] And he mentioned the name of a woman, Viola Lepper, a dear, sweet saint of God, who's only been a Christian a few months,
[time=3211] comes to church every week on a walker, had more suffering than most of us will ever know in all of our lifetime.
[time=3218] She had come home with her husband after going out to eat.
[time=3222] He said he hadn't felt good, and he stayed up in the living room.
[time=3225] A couple of hours later, when he hadn't come to bed, she went out, and he had had a heart attack, and he was dead.
[time=3231] They took him to the hospital, and they called me.
[time=3236] And I went down, and I expressed my love to Viola, put my arm around her, and prayed with her,
[time=3243] introduced myself to the other members of the family that I did not know.
[time=3246] And she said, "Pastor, would you go in the room as I say my final goodbye to Jim?" I said, "I'll be glad to do that." Another thought struck me. Jim doesn't come to church very often, and as far as I know, he doesn't know the Lord.
[time=3261] When we got in the room, she said, "Would you pray?" And I thought in my heart, and I mentioned this to the chaplain later, "I don't know how to pray, except to pray for God's blessing upon this dear woman and her friends." And I didn't even mention Jim's name because I didn't know what to say.
[time=3278] I came back, and I was burdened about that. We had a prayer meeting here on Saturday morning with a group of men.
[time=3284] And I was telling the men this story, and one of the guys said, "Hey, Pastor, there's part of it you don't know." I said, "What's that?" They said, "You know, he lives right behind Vic Moats, and on Tuesday night Vic was burdened for that man.
[time=3296] He walked across the alleyway, and he said, "Hey, Jim, could I come in and talk with you for a few moments?" And he went into his house, and sat down, and opened the Word of God, and shared with him the Gospel story.
[time=3307] And Jim opened his heart and received Jesus Christ as his Savior.
[time=3311] He met the Lord on Tuesday, and he was with him on Friday.
[time=3316] You say, "How do you know that? It's in the book.
[time=3320] The Bible says that if thou shalt believe with thine heart, the Lord Jesus, thou shalt be saved."
[time=3326] And I want to say to you, all of our friends here and those who watch on television, the greatest message you will ever hear is what you've heard this morning.
[time=3333] God loves you. He paid the penalty for your sin through his son Jesus Christ, and he offers you eternal life as a free gift.
[time=3340] You can have it today if you'll just ask him for it confessing your sin.
[time=3345] Won't you do it? Shall we pray together?
[time=3350] Those of you who are watching in home as we conclude our time with you, let me ask you right now if you don't know Jesus Christ as your Savior, simply to bow your head right where you are in front of the television.
[time=3361] Say, "Lord Jesus, I do know I'm a sinner, and I thank you for what you did for me on the cross.
[time=3366] I accept the payment for my sin from Calvary, and right now by faith,
[time=3372] I invite you to come into my life and be my Savior." And I want to tell you something friend.
[time=3378] When you pray that prayer, he'll do what he said he will do, and he'll be in you and live through you and give you eternal life today.

[time=3546] I'm asking you, do you know Christ?
[time=3548] And by that I mean, have you ever come to the place in your life personally where you have said,
[time=3554] I do know that God loves me, that Christ died for me, that He paid the penalty for my sin on the cross.
