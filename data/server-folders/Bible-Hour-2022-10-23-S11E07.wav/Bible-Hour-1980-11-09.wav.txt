[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=21] [MUSIC]
[time=51] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=59] >> And we welcome you to this hour, all of you who have gathered here
[time=66] in the sanctuary for the second worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and all of our friends who have joined us by way of television and especially to a whole group of new friends in Terahote, Indiana, who are watching us now.
[time=82] We're so grateful for the privilege of sharing the ministry with you people and we're praying that the service will be a blessing and encouragement not only to all of us who are here physically but to all of you who have joined us by the miracle of the media.
[time=97] This is the pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church speaking and today we are addressing the subject from the Word of God how to be poor and yet rich and I hope that you will have your Bibles ready
[time=111] to study along with us but right now let's listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=117] [MUSIC - 207 seconds]
[time=327] Thank you, choir.
[time=329] This is a very special month of ministry and teaching here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=334] It is Stewardship Month and I'm sure that in the minds of some folks that must sound like the worst month of the year but in fact it's one of the great months of the year here as we focus in on the blessing of God in our lives and how he enables us to be involved in his work and his kingdom.
[time=353] What we've discovered as Christians from the Word of God is this.
[time=357] That it isn't being a church person that's important but it is knowing Jesus Christ
[time=363] and understanding that it is he alone who brings satisfaction to us.
[time=368] That's why I'm so excited about the song the Peterson's are going to share with us for.
[time=372] They remind us that only Jesus can satisfy the soul.
[time=376] And I hope that you'll listen now to the Peterson's as they sing and share with us in this way.
[time=382] [MUSIC]
[time=404] The world will draw to satisfy the day belonging in your soul.
[time=416] You may search the wide road Lord, but you'll be just as before.
[time=428] You'll never find to satisfy God until you find the Lord.
[time=440] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=450] [MUSIC]
[time=480] For his Lord is Lord.
[time=509] He is resentful for dead and he is Lord.
[time=521] Every day shall bow, every tongue confess.
[time=533] That Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=543] He's King of Kings, Lord of Lords.
[time=554] Jesus is Lord of Lords.
[time=591] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=603] And only he can change your heart and make you hurt.
[time=615] He'll give you peace you'd never do.
[time=620] Sweet love and joy and heaven too.
[time=626] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=645] It's really a delight for us to share with you on the Bible Hour each week.
[time=654] My wife Don and I have a wonderful opportunity during our television program to sit down and talk with you.
[time=660] We like to consider it just as if we were visiting with you in your living room.
[time=665] That's the whole format of these few moments as we share with you what God is doing through the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=671] And encourage you to be a part of the expanded ministry of the Bible Hour through literature.
[time=676] Donna, we got one tremendous letter this week.
[time=679] I think representing a whole host of people, some of whom we never hear from.
[time=683] But it's such an encouragement when we do hear from them.
[time=685] Why don't you share that letter with our friends at home?
[time=687] Yeah, I'd be glad to.
[time=689] This individual writes, "I have certainly enjoyed reading the Bible with the daily walk.
[time=694] I have read the new, but never the Old Testament completely.
[time=698] Thanks to the daily walk, I have now not only read it all, but feel I have a better understanding of the Bible."
[time=704] And now comes for the really super part.
[time=707] Thank you for the excellent Bible Hour.
[time=709] More than a year ago, I accepted Jesus as my Savior because of the Bible Hour.
[time=715] That ought to be a real encouragement to those Founders Club members who are watching and are wondering if they're getting any fruit from their investment.
[time=723] And this is just a sample of the letters we get.
[time=725] Donna, in a few minutes, I'm going to preach from the Book of Matthew and teach the principle that when we invest in eternity, one of the ways we do that is by sending our money ahead to glory in the people that are one for Christ.
[time=738] And I know that everyone who's had a part in giving to the Bible Hour television ministry is going to be a part of the reward from God, even for this one soul that has come to Christ.
[time=748] And there are many, many hundreds of others, some of whom we have heard from and many of whom have never taken time to write.
[time=754] So we do thank you for your investment in the Bible Hour ministry, for your faithful giving and praying, most of all for your participation each week as the telecast comes into your area.
[time=763] And that's especially true this week as we reach out into a whole new area in Terahote, Indiana.
[time=769] We're so grateful for the privilege of being on that station, and we welcome all of you who are joining us there this week for the first time.
[time=776] We hope that if you're seeing the Bible Hour today, you will take a moment this week to write us and let us know that the program is reaching you and we trust that it's being an encouragement to you as well.
[time=787] We've prepared a very special little book that I think is very exciting for this time of the year.
[time=794] This little booklet called "The Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely" is the fruit of a series of messages given earlier this year on the subject of loneliness.
[time=804] And here are the scriptures that we've researched from the Bible to help those who are going through this kind of a situation.
[time=811] Donna, it is a very special kind of thing for this time of the year because this is a time of the year when people have a tendency to experience loneliness.
[time=819] I think it's very difficult when you're by yourself if you're single or recently widowed or divorced.
[time=826] Or maybe you're just a long way away from your family like, for instance, I happen to be all of my family except for my husband and children are a thousand miles away.
[time=835] And so sometimes during the holiday times it can be a very lonely season for people.
[time=841] And that's why we think this booklet will be of great help to all of our friends during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.
[time=848] And it's the kind of book that you can read for yourself and pass on to a friend, or you can have your friend write and we'd be happy to send them a copy.
[time=855] But this booklet, which is the scriptures, arranged for the lonely, will be something you will turn to time and time again as you view the promises and the prescriptions for your own life.
[time=867] Now the first section deals with some Psalms from the Old Testament where David expresses his heart of loneliness.
[time=873] The second section are all the promises we found in the scripture related to those who are alone.
[time=879] And then the third section are verses of scripture that tell you something to do because you're lonely, such as cast your burden upon the Lord for he careth for you, many instructions to the lonely.
[time=890] And I think you'll find that the arrangement of the scripture as well as the content of God's Word will be a great help.
[time=896] We'd like to send this to you absolutely free if you'll get in touch with us this week.
[time=901] Donna, you tell them how to do that so very well. Why don't you do it this time?
[time=905] We have a toll-free number which we have established, which you may call at any time during the day or in fact any time during the week.
[time=912] Just call 1-800-453-9000.
[time=916] Ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like your copy of this booklet.
[time=922] Also we'd be happy to send you a free copy of the daily walk if you would just request it.
[time=927] Or if you prefer, you may write to us and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=938] And either way, whether you prefer to call us or write to us, be sure and do it this week.
[time=944] And as we go back to the service, we want to encourage you to stay with us for a very special message from the book of Matthew on how to be poor and yet rich.
[time=954] It's not a paradox, it's a biblical truth and I think you'll appreciate what God has to teach us from His Word today.
[time=960] And we appreciate so much the fellowship we share with you as we teach and preach the Word of God together.
[time=984] [MUSIC]
[time=1002] The eyes of God are upon me.
[time=1014] He sees everything I do.
[time=1026] And he knows where I am, every hour of every day.
[time=1054] He knows each thought I think.
[time=1058] He knows each word that I might say.
[time=1063] And although there were times I stepped out of His wings, I've never been out of His care.
[time=1085] This changing world alarms me, with war, with sin, with strife.
[time=1106] But my loving father, he charts me, with joy, with peace, and with light.
[time=1128] And he knows where I am, every hour of every day.
[time=1137] He knows each thought I think.
[time=1141] He knows each word that I might say.
[time=1146] And although there were times I stepped out of His wings.
[time=1160] I've never been out of His care.
[time=1173] [MUSIC]
[time=1191] Thank you, ladies, for that ministry.
[time=1194] We're going to hear in just a moment from Lena Peterson.
[time=1198] But we're going to do something a little out of the ordinary today.
[time=1201] We're going to want us to read the Scripture before she sings.
[time=1204] And I think you'll understand that when we do it.
[time=1206] Take your Bibles and let's turn to the sixth chapter of the book of Matthew.
[time=1211] And in Matthew chapter 6, we're going to read together out loud, verses 19 through 24.
[time=1218] Matthew 6, 19 through 24.
[time=1223] I hope you brought a Bible, and if you didn't, to someone next to you will let you share theirs, so you can be a part of the reading this morning.
[time=1230] Matthew 6, 19 through 24.
[time=1233] We'll read as Lena comes and prepares to sing for us.
[time=1236] Lay not up for yourselves.
[time=1238] Let's read together.
[time=1239] Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust are corrupt,
[time=1246] and where thieves break through and steal.
[time=1249] But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust are corrupt,
[time=1257] and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
[time=1261] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=1266] The light of the body is the eye.
[time=1269] If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
[time=1275] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
[time=1281] If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?
[time=1288] No man can serve two masters.
[time=1292] For either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.
[time=1301] You cannot serve God and man.
[time=1305] And now let us listen to the music.
[time=1311] I can hear the voice of Jesus gently saying to me,
[time=1328] You have a life that I have been.
[time=1333] How will you spend it?
[time=1336] But will you do?
[time=1342] There is no way to serve two masters.
[time=1347] You cannot live for God and man.
[time=1352] Don't work for treasure here on earth.
[time=1357] Star of your prophets in the hand.
[time=1362] For where your treasure is, that's where your heart is.
[time=1395] Through what your life has given freely, everything that you need.
[time=1406] But there is more that he will give.
[time=1411] If you will listen, and will obey.
[time=1420] What you give to me will be written to, and so much more to lay the verbose.
[time=1430] This is the promise that he gives.
[time=1435] Just have the faith to be laid.
[time=1440] For where your treasure is, that's where your heart is.
[time=1465] Riches are not found on earth.
[time=1489] Now you understand why we read the scripture first.
[time=1492] It isn't that beautiful to read it and then to hear it, and now we're going to study it.
[time=1497] And that's, I think, honoring to the Lord.
[time=1499] So let's take our Bibles and with them open to this sixth chapter.
[time=1503] Let us pray together and ask for his blessing upon our study.
[time=1508] Father, we thank you so much for your word.
[time=1511] It is an encouragement to us.
[time=1515] It is a light unto our pathway, guiding us and directing us and giving us help and giving us instruction for every part of living.
[time=1528] And this that we study today is no exception.
[time=1531] It is a blessing and an encouragement.
[time=1534] And we pray that our hearts will be open to receive the wonderful word of God.
[time=1539] For we pray in his name, in the name of his son, the Lord Jesus, amen.
[time=1546] One rainy Sunday afternoon, two little children were looking into some way to pass the time
[time=1554] and decided that they would reenact the Sunday school lesson of the morning hour.
[time=1560] And on that particular Sunday morning in their class, they had studied the story of Noah.
[time=1566] So as they gathered together the equipment for reenacting the story, they found a rather substantial cardboard box which looked like it might be impervious to the rain.
[time=1578] And together they took the box upstairs and they put it in the bathtub.
[time=1583] And of course the showers had to come so they turned the shower on and down came the rains.
[time=1589] The rains came down and the floods came up and the little arc was born up on the crest of the tub water.
[time=1597] Well, after a while when it seemed like it had rained for 40 days and 40 nights, they turned the rain off and they turned the sun on.
[time=1605] They turned the light on in the bathroom.
[time=1607] The sun didn't seem to be doing its work so they helped it out a little bit.
[time=1610] And one of them went over and pulled the plug down with the floods, down went the arc until it rested on dry ground.
[time=1617] Well, they thought that was quite an accomplishment.
[time=1620] They had relived the entire story of the day.
[time=1623] But the little girl said to her brother, "There was more to that story. It didn't end there.
[time=1628] Don't you remember when they landed on dry ground they offered a sacrifice to God?"
[time=1634] That's right, he said.
[time=1635] And he reached into the little cardboard arc and he pulled out one of her toy animals.
[time=1640] He said, "Let's sacrifice this. We'll do it on the stove down in the kitchen." "Oh, no," she said, "You're not going to sacrifice my animal." And she reached into the arc and pulled out one of his animals and she said, "We'll take this down to the stove and we'll sacrifice this one." "Oh, no," he said, "You're not going to sacrifice my animal." "I have an idea," she said. And up to the balcony, she, up to the attic she bounded.
[time=1666] You see even my language is churchy. Up to the balcony she bounded.
[time=1670] And she came back down out of the attic and in her hand she had a toy lamb.
[time=1678] Only had three legs, one of them had been torn off.
[time=1682] The head had been kind of caved in and bashed around.
[time=1685] And the color of the toy lamb was so faded you couldn't even tell what its original shade was.
[time=1692] "Here," she said, "We can give this to God." And they both agreed and down to the kitchen they went.
[time=1702] I read that story, that modern parable, and I was reminded of the fact that that's the way so many of God's children do business with him.
[time=1713] We're willing to give him what's left over, that doesn't hurt.
[time=1717] We'll give him what's convenient when all the bills are paid at the end of the year when we need a tax deduction.
[time=1723] We'll throw in a little extra.
[time=1726] But don't ask me to give anything to you God that hurts, anything that I love, anything that's really mine, something that's my treasure.
[time=1736] And I told you that little story today as an introduction to this message because I want you to understand that the passage we are teaching is dealing with the treasure.
[time=1747] Four times literally in these first few verses, that word is used twice as a verb and twice as a noun.
[time=1754] You can't see it in the text because it's translated a different way.
[time=1758] But I want you to notice how it's really literally translated.
[time=1762] It says, "Treasure not up for yourselves, treasures on earth, but treasure up for yourselves, treasures in heaven."
[time=1770] The word lay up is the same word for treasure that is translated by the word treasure later on in the phrase.
[time=1776] The first word is a verb, treasure up.
[time=1779] And the last word is a noun, treasure up a treasure.
[time=1783] So God is teaching us what to do with our treasures, not with our leftovers, not with the things we can easily throw aside that don't hurt or bother us, but he's talking about the very substance of our life.
[time=1796] And that's so very critical for us to understand.
[time=1799] For he tells us in this passage of Scripture that we have a decision to make.
[time=1804] The instruction concerning our decision is clear.
[time=1808] There are two imperatives in the text.
[time=1811] One says, "Lay not up for yourselves, treasure not up for yourselves, treasures on earth, but rather treasure up for yourselves, treasures in heaven."
[time=1822] Now the word treasure is an interesting little Greek word. It is a word which carries with it the connotation of laying something horizontally.
[time=1830] There are several words for treasure in the New Testament language.
[time=1833] One of them is to set something aside perpendicular, which gives to you the idea that it is not going to be passive, it's going to be active, it's going to be moving.
[time=1842] But when you lay something aside horizontally, you stack it up, you treasure it up, you put it away for future use.
[time=1849] When I was a little boy, I remember somebody telling me something sort of like this.
[time=1854] I'm sure I have lost some of it in the translation through the years, but someone once told me that a miser understands that coins are flat so that they might stack up.
[time=1864] But a spendthrift realizes that coins are flat so that they might roll.
[time=1869] There's a difference in how we look at this whole matter of the treasure.
[time=1873] We're talking here about laying things aside for the future, treasuring it up, and the first instruction concerning our decision according to the text is a negative one.
[time=1883] He does not ask our opinion, he says to us, "Do not treasure up treasures on the earth."
[time=1891] No, what does he mean? Well, he's talking about the fact that some men will confine their ambition and their interests and their hopes to this life.
[time=1904] Some men will put all they have in their house and in their family and in their status and in their position and in their interest, whether it be sports or whatever, they live for this world.
[time=1916] And God says to us in his wonderful word, "Do not get caught up in treasuring up treasures on this earth."
[time=1925] But I want you to notice that positively he tells us there's an alternative.
[time=1929] But he says, "Treasure up treasures for yourselves in heaven."
[time=1935] Now I want you to notice something about this text that you might overlook if you read it quickly.
[time=1940] I want you to notice that it is not wrong to treasure. It is not wrong to lay up.
[time=1946] In fact, it's not wrong to treasure for yourselves.
[time=1950] For you'll notice in both the negative and the positive phrase, we are talking about treasuring up something for ourselves.
[time=1958] Do not treasure up for yourselves anything in this earth, but treasure up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[time=1965] You see, the problem is not treasuring. There is built within every human being a passion for possession.
[time=1974] And passions are only wrong when they are perverted.
[time=1978] The passion for possession is not wrong. It is the misuse and the abuse of the passion for possession that is wrong.
[time=1986] If you can stand all of the peas in this pod, listen carefully.
[time=1991] It is your purpose behind your passion for possession. That's the principle. You got it?
[time=1997] It is your purpose behind your passion for possession that is the principle we want to talk about.
[time=2007] Passion without principle burns out your life.
[time=2013] You see, the principle is involved in the place where the treasure is.
[time=2019] And what God would tell us in this passage today is that we are not children of today, we are children of tomorrow.
[time=2025] So if we put all of our treasures in today, there is coming a tomorrow in our life when there will be nothing for which we may look forward.
[time=2034] The thing that matters to us as Christians and to God as He instructs us is this.
[time=2040] Not so much the possession of the treasure as the effect the possession of the treasure will have on us.
[time=2047] Now here's the first point, verses 19 and 20, the instruction concerning your decision.
[time=2054] Do you have the instruction? It is both negative and positive.
[time=2057] Lay not up for yourselves treasures on this earth, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[time=2063] Now, number two, God gives to us some insight into the decision.
[time=2068] I have been thinking this week of how wonderful it is of God that He does not just give us instructions and then not try to help us understand what is behind the instruction.
[time=2079] So often His parents, when our children ask us why they can or can't do this or that, what do we say?
[time=2086] Because I said so.
[time=2089] That's the lazy man's answer, which usually means we're too busy to explain it to them or there really isn't any explanation.
[time=2097] But when God tells us something to do, I've discovered in reading His word to man that so often He takes time to help us understand why He is explaining to us or encouraging us or instructing us to do a certain thing.
[time=2112] Now He could have ended the passage right here and simply said, "Don't lay up treasures on this earth, lay them up on heaven and gone on to the next point."
[time=2120] But He didn't do that.
[time=2122] He helps us understand why it is foolish.
[time=2125] And so now we get some insight into the decision we must make. Notice, first of all, again negatively.
[time=2132] He says, "If you lay your treasures up on this earth, you will discover that they do not last."
[time=2139] What is the hymn that says, "Change and decay in all around I see?" That's a phrase which could be put over the worldly treasures of today.
[time=2149] If you put all of your treasure in the world today, you will discover that you're putting it in a hole in the ground from which you will never recover it. It is not going to last.
[time=2158] Now He uses two phrases in the text to help teach that point to us and I want you to notice them.
[time=2164] First of all, He tells us that if we put our treasures in the world today, we will discover that there is a danger inherent in the treasure and there is a danger outside of the treasure.
[time=2175] Notice, first of all, the inward danger or the danger from within. He uses two phrases to explain that to us.
[time=2181] He says, "When you put your hope in the treasures of this life, you will discover that the moth comes and rust comes."
[time=2188] Now, the interesting thing about rust and moth is this.
[time=2193] They are somehow a part of that which they consume.
[time=2197] The moth becomes a part of the fabric almost that He consumes. And rust is that which is attached to the metallic substances.
[time=2207] It is part of the metal. It eats it from the outside in and destroys it. It becomes a part of the very thing that it destroys.
[time=2215] And I think God would have us to know from this illustration, men and women, that when we set our minds upon the treasures of this world, there is that which is inherent in the very treasure itself
[time=2226] that will eat itself up and destroy it so that we cannot enjoy it and gain its blessing.
[time=2233] The late Robert Horton said that the greatest lesson he learned from life was that people who set their minds and hearts on money were equally disappointed whether they got it or whether they didn't.
[time=2246] And he was right.
[time=2248] I think that's one of the reasons why we have the instruction in 2 Peter 1 in verse 4, which tells us that by exceeding great and precious promises that by these we have been made partakers of the divine nature.
[time=2262] Now, listen, in order that we might escape the corruption that is in the world through lust.
[time=2268] This old world is passing away. It's fading away. It's corrupting. It's dying.
[time=2273] But because we have become Christians, we have received the divine nature and by the precious promises of the word of God, we have been made children of God, and we are going to escape the corruption that is in the world.
[time=2285] So how foolish it is for us who have ultimately escaped it to invest all that we have of this world's substance in that which one day we're going to leave.
[time=2294] That's what Peter would have us learn.
[time=2297] But notice in the text there is another danger to worldly investment.
[time=2301] It is not only that which gets it from within itself, but it is that which gets it from without.
[time=2307] He says, "Where thieves break through and steal." What are the thieves that break through and steal?
[time=2315] Why, there's so many of them we could not catalog them today in this brief time.
[time=2319] Sometimes it's illness.
[time=2322] It breaks through and steals us away from our treasure so we can't enjoy them.
[time=2328] Sometimes it's a business loss. It may be an economic collapse, a downturn in the economy like we've been experiencing.
[time=2335] It might be war. It could be death.
[time=2339] But you can be sure of this.
[time=2342] If you are putting all of your money into this world, there are many possibilities for thieves to break through and steal it away from you so you can enjoy it.
[time=2352] I read this week this bit of nonsensical poetry, but it teaches us a lesson.
[time=2359] It says he always said he would retire when he had made a million clear.
[time=2365] And so he toiled into the dusk from day to day, from year to year.
[time=2370] At last he put his ledgers up and he laid his stock reports aside.
[time=2375] And when he started out to live, he discovered he'd already died.
[time=2382] Now you say what is the meaning of that?
[time=2384] Simply this, that the man had so invested himself in a massing goods that in the process of his quest for his ultimate goal, he had forgotten what life was all about.
[time=2394] And when, having lived his whole life like that, he wanted to live, he couldn't live because he didn't know how.
[time=2402] I am told that in Deadwood, South Dakota, there is a museum, which remembers some of the great and poignant experiences of the great gold rush days.
[time=2416] And in that museum, there is a display that has in it a tombstone with this epitaph on it, remembering a beleaguered prospector of a bygone day.
[time=2428] This is what it says, "I lost my gun, I lost my horse, I'm out of food, the Indians are after me, but I've got all the gold I can carry."
[time=2443] I know people like that.
[time=2445] They've lost their home, they've lost their family, they've lost their relationship, they've lost their spiritual vitality, they've lost what is involved in a meaningful relationship.
[time=2457] They've lost what is involved in friends, but they've got all the gold they can carry.
[time=2466] How silly it is, how silly it is to put all of your treasure in this world and then have it stolen from you by the very life which you live.
[time=2480] Well, there is a positive side to this, and that positive side, according to the scripture, is that we don't have to lay up treasures in this earth, we can lay them up in heaven.
[time=2491] And I want you to notice that verse 20, where it talks about the treasures laid up in heaven, is full of negatives.
[time=2497] You wouldn't expect that, would you?
[time=2499] But it's true.
[time=2500] Verse 20 says, "When you lay your treasure up in heaven, nothing but negative happens.
[time=2505] No moth, no rust, no thieves, isn't that great?
[time=2510] In this world which so emphasizes the importance of the positive, I think we ought to stop God once in a while and thank Him for the negatives of the spiritual life."
[time=2519] Do you know heaven is negative?
[time=2521] No tears, no crying, no sadness, no sickness?
[time=2527] When you put your treasure in God's hands in heaven, the Bible says that it can't be taken away from you.
[time=2538] Once again, I refer to the writings of Peter in 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 4.
[time=2543] This is how he describes it.
[time=2544] I think it's a beautiful chapter, and just listen to it.
[time=2548] 1 Peter 1, 4, he says, "That we have an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for us."
[time=2560] Isn't that great?
[time=2562] The treasure we put in heaven is, according to Peter, it can't be corrupted, it can't be defiled, it won't fade away, and it's being cared for and reserved in heaven for us.
[time=2573] And if you open that text sometime in study it, you'll discover that Peter goes on to answer the obvious question, "Well, what happens to me if I don't get there?"
[time=2581] And Peter says, "Listen, not only is your treasure reserved for you, but you're being reserved for your treasure." God takes care of the investment and the investor until the time to cash in on it comes around.
[time=2592] And that's a wonderful thing that only happens in the economy of spiritual investment.
[time=2599] Well, you say, "Pastor Jeremiah, how do you lay up treasure for heaven?" You know, sometimes we preachers give you these high and lofty truths, these wonderful, wonderful, beautiful concepts, and you go home and you say, "Yeah, that's true, but I wonder how you do it."
[time=2616] And I don't want to leave you that way.
[time=2618] I have kind of made it a pet project over these past days to try to research how you lay up treasures in heaven.
[time=2624] Well, you can't send it in an envelope, obviously.
[time=2628] And as we mentioned last week in our little story about the casket, you can't put it in the casket and hope that it gets there, either by check or cash.
[time=2636] So how do you get your treasures in heaven?
[time=2638] Well, let me show you three passages of Scripture that I think will help us.
[time=2641] First of all, I want you to turn in your Bibles to Luke 16.
[time=2645] And Luke 16, chapter 8, verses 8 and 9.
[time=2650] Here in the 16th chapter of the book of Luke, we have the story of the unjust steward, and we have some great teaching here about investing for eternity.
[time=2660] We read in verses 8 and 9 these words, "And the Lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
[time=2673] And I say unto you to make friends to yourselves of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail, they may receive you into eternal habitations.
[time=2684] Now, what does that mean?
[time=2686] Our Lord teaches in this passage of Scripture that the children of this world, of this generation, the children of the earth, non-believers are wiser as it relates to their world than the children of light hour as it relates to their world.
[time=2702] You see what he's saying?
[time=2704] Unbelievers seem to understand how the natural world works a lot better than believers understand how the spiritual world works.
[time=2712] And one of the things that an unbelieving person in the natural world learns quickly, and that is, that he takes care of tomorrow.
[time=2719] He makes friends for tomorrow.
[time=2721] He's a pragmatic individual.
[time=2723] He makes sure that he's got the end in sight and that he's doing what he needs to do for the future.
[time=2729] And God, through his word, takes that, and now our Lord says in effect, I'm going to take that as a principle and apply it to you.
[time=2738] If you have money, so use that money while you are here in this world that when you arrive in glory, the people who benefited by it will be there to receive you.
[time=2749] Hey, let me ask you a question.
[time=2751] When you get to heaven, is there going to be anybody to stick out their hand and say to you, "Hey, thank you for what you did that helped me get here."
[time=2758] I'm not talking just about money.
[time=2760] I'm talking about witnessing and testimony and influence and all the rest.
[time=2765] But here the passage is dealing with Mammon.
[time=2768] That's money.
[time=2769] And the passage says that you can lay up treasures in heaven by investing your money in such a way that it affects people.
[time=2777] And the people go to heaven, and so your treasure goes to heaven.
[time=2780] When you get there, they're going to slap you on the back and say, "Brother, if you hadn't given, I might not have been here."
[time=2787] Now let's look at another passage.
[time=2790] 1 Timothy 6, 17 through 19.
[time=2793] We'll have to do this quickly.
[time=2795] Here in this portion of God's word is Paul addresses young Timothy.
[time=2799] He says to him, "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God who give us richly all things to enjoy, that they do good, that they be rich in good words.
[time=2816] Ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay whole of eternal life."
[time=2829] Do you hear it?
[time=2830] Laying up for themselves a good foundation against the future.
[time=2835] And it tells us how we do it.
[time=2837] By doing good, by distributing, by communicating, by being involved in benevolence.
[time=2842] It is a passage of Scripture that teaches us the importance of even the projects that we are involved in for the cause of Christ.
[time=2850] And the Bible teaches us that as we involve ourselves in the projects that touch the lives of people,
[time=2857] that in that secondary means we are laying up foundations in heaven which will be there when we get there.
[time=2865] And that's another way to send treasures to heaven and to build your treasure in glory.
[time=2870] And then if I had time, I'd take you to even a third passage, but let me just tell you that in Matthew 25, and verses 42 through 45, we're told that when we do anything to the least of the brethren of Christ, we do it unto the Lord.
[time=2884] And when I see someone who is hurting, someone who is poor, someone who is needy, and I reach out to that person in the body of Christ,
[time=2893] and I minister to that person who is poor, who is having a difficult time, the Bible says I'm sending up treasures to heaven for,
[time=2900] when I do it to him, I do it to the Lord, and he's there.
[time=2904] Now those are just two or three ideas, and there are many more.
[time=2908] In essence, what we're saying is this, that when we invest what we have in the things of eternity,
[time=2914] in the things of the church, and the things that belong to Christ, that investment outlives us and will meet us when we get to heaven.
[time=2922] There is in John 627 a general principle that underlies all of that, it's John 627, this is what it says,
[time=2929] labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.
[time=2938] Now the decision is yours.
[time=2941] You can lay up treasures in this world, and we have some insight into what will happen.
[time=2949] Now let me tell you how important the decision is.
[time=2954] Verses 21 through 24 tell us that this is not just a financial matter.
[time=2959] I get so tired of people talking about stewardship as if it were some sort of ugly appendage to the Christian life,
[time=2966] sort of a growth.
[time=2968] You know, I wish we could cut it off, but it's there and we got to live with it.
[time=2972] Men and women stewardship is not something you do once a month because it's an emphasis.
[time=2977] Stewardship is all there is to the Christian life. It is not part of it. It's everything.
[time=2982] And here is a tremendous illustration of that.
[time=2985] For in these next few verses we are told that what we do with our treasure determines what happens to our heart,
[time=2992] what happens to our mind, what happens to our will, and ultimately what happens to our soul and spirit.
[time=2999] Notice verse 21.
[time=3002] We are told in this wonderful verse that where our treasure is, our heart is.
[time=3009] And what we are learning here is this, that everything depends upon where your treasure is as to where your heart will be.
[time=3017] And we also know from the scripture that everything depends upon where your heart is as to where you will be,
[time=3024] for the scripture says, as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.
[time=3030] It's almost as if the scripture is teaching that when you put your treasure there, your heart follows hard after it.
[time=3037] And when your heart gets there, you follow hard after it and where your treasure is, you become.
[time=3043] Isn't it true that wherever we have investment, that's what we study, that's what we learn, that's what we want to be a part of?
[time=3049] I've learned in the years of this church that the people are involved spiritually and in their stewardship of the ministry here have the greatest concern.
[time=3057] They're at the meetings, they're at the opportunities for involvement, they're serving, they're enjoying, they're excited about it.
[time=3064] Why? They're treasures here.
[time=3066] They're investing regularly in the ministry and they want to be a part of it.
[time=3071] And that's the principle that the Word of God teaches, that when we invest in heaven it determines the reality of our emotional life, where our heart is.
[time=3079] But notice, he says secondly that it determines where our mind is, this wonderful verse, verse 22 teaches us this principle.
[time=3088] It says, "For the light of the body is the eye, if therefore thine eye be single, the whole body shall be full of light."
[time=3096] And here's the teaching briefly.
[time=3098] He is saying that just as our two eyes come in to focus a single image on the screen of our mind,
[time=3107] so it is important for the believer to have single vision as it relates to his life.
[time=3112] But if that person has one eye on the treasures of the earth and the other eye on the treasures of heaven, he will have a distorted picture of life and he will not be single-minded in all that he does.
[time=3123] And he will be double-minded and he will have a difficult time understanding what life is all about.
[time=3129] What he's teaching us here is this, that when we get our priorities right in stewardship men and women, we have an integrated person.
[time=3136] All of us are involved in the Christian experience, not secular out here, sacred here, but I work in order that I might serve and I give as a fruit of my labor.
[time=3147] And all my life is revolving around the singleness of heart, that single-mindedness that is mine.
[time=3155] And then he goes on to tell us that it's a matter of our volition.
[time=3159] He says that you can't serve two masters, and the whole concept of serving is a willingness to be involved.
[time=3165] And he's saying, volitionally, if your heart is right, if your mind is right, if your treasure is right, you will be serving in the realm where you've made your investment.
[time=3176] And finally, and certainly not least important, he reminds us that we only have the capacity as individuals created in the image of God to have one God.
[time=3187] We will either love God or we will not.
[time=3191] And what we do with our money is a good illustration of where our love is and where our excitement is and where our worship is.
[time=3199] If we are worshiping money for it, what it can do for us now, we can't be loving God as we should.
[time=3205] And if we are loving God, then all that we are in have will be a part of that wonderful worship that we bring to him as a sacrifice.
[time=3214] So you see, it is important what you do about your decision.
[time=3219] The instruction is lay not up down here but up there.
[time=3222] The insight is that what we lay up down here doesn't last, what we lay up up there is for eternity.
[time=3228] The importance is that where your treasure is, your heart is.
[time=3232] Edward Markham, the poet, tells this modern parable in one of his books.
[time=3239] He says there was a certain rich man who wanted to do something good and one day he was walking through a poor section of town and he saw the hovel of a house where a poor carpenter lived.
[time=3251] After some deep thought, he went to see the carpenter and he gave him the plans for a beautiful new house.
[time=3257] He asked the carpenter if he would build that house for him.
[time=3260] He told him that sometime soon he would come back and see how things were doing.
[time=3265] He asked him to build a house on a certain lovely spot and the instructions that he gave him were as follows.
[time=3271] He wanted it to be as fine and as sturdy as possible.
[time=3274] He said, "Use only the best materials, employ only the best workmen, and when I come from my journey I will inspect it and you will be paid."
[time=3287] Well, the carpenter saw his chance.
[time=3289] Other men he knew in the industry would make plenty for themselves on the side and so why shouldn't he?
[time=3296] So he skimped on the materials, he employed inexperienced and inexpensive help.
[time=3303] He covered all of the mistakes that were made with a coat of paint.
[time=3308] So when the rich man returned the house was finished and the carpenter brought the keys to him and he lied to him and he said, "Well, I've done just what you've told me to do. I've finished it just like you said."
[time=3318] "I'm glad," said the rich man, "for here are the keys, they're yours. I had you build that house for yourself and for your family and I want you to have it as a gift from me in which to live."
[time=3333] Men and women with the materials that God has entrusted to us were building the house up there.
[time=3340] Someday we'll live in it. Someday we will see what we have done with our lives and we will live with that for eternity.
[time=3349] Doesn't it make sense to lay up treasures in heaven where we're going to spend eternity and to begin to do it now?
[time=3358] Shall we pray?
[time=3361] Father, our heads are bowed before thee as we submit ourselves to the truth of thy word.
[time=3370] We recognize that as we have preached this message there must be some to whom this whole matter of eternal life is foreign.
[time=3379] And we would pray right now in the closing moments of this service that if men and women have not made preparation for heaven, they would do it.
[time=3387] Even as we pray in this moment, if you haven't trusted Christ as your Savior, wherever you may be as you watch this service, I'm going to ask you right now to confess that you're a sinner before God.
[time=3398] To open your heart and receive Jesus Christ his Son into your life as your Savior, confessing that his death, burial and resurrection is the gospel of the Word of God.
[time=3409] And having received him, acknowledge him as your Savior and walk with him in the days ahead.
[time=3414] And when you do that, if you will let us know, we'd be happy to help you in your growth.
