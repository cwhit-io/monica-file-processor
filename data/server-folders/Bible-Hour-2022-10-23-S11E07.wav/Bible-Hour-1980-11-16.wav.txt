[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=6] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=16] [MUSIC]
[time=42] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=47] We're happy to welcome you to this service, all of you who have gathered here in the auditorium for the second hour of worship, which we observe here on the Lord's Day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church,
[time=58] and all of our friends who have joined us by way of television.
[time=61] We counted a real privilege to share the unsearchable riches of the grace of God
[time=67] through the exciting media of television with many friends all over this part of the country.
[time=72] We have some guests with us today who will be a blessing to you called "Life Unlimited" and we'll hear from them in a few moments.
[time=79] But right now, let's listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they sing for us.
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=116] Sing his praise, his glory still.
[time=121] Lord, his Word will sing, his praise, his glory still.
[time=126] If the keep was in his love.
[time=130] O, O, o, o, o, o, o, and his love that has no end.
[time=138] [MUSIC]
[time=154] O, that we had a thousand voices.
[time=163] To sing our great free-teachers praises.
[time=171] To tell his comports, to know his peace,
[time=179] to tell his loving grace and kindness.
[time=188] O, give to us a thousand voices.
[time=206] O, that we heard a thousand voices.
[time=210] And we may let our joy be known forever.
[time=220] O, the ways that our souls and the voices.
[time=228] O, we have a thousand voices.
[time=233] To let our joy be known.
[time=247] For many people that love the Lord and let your joy be known.
[time=254] Give up your voice and join the song that's grown.
[time=267] [MUSIC]
[time=293] Thank you, choir, and the soloist was Crystal Hall.
[time=296] And we appreciate so much their ministry to us as a choir.
[time=301] We're so happy to have with us today some guests that we want you to meet.
[time=305] We're going to meet a singing group in just a moment, but I look down from my vantage point at the pulpit and see that some very dear friends who minister here often in the ministry of our church are visiting with us today, sitting here in the auditorium.
[time=322] I had lunch with Steve and Maria Gardner know it was dinner, with Steve and Maria Gardner in Dallas, Texas two weeks ago, and they're visiting with us today, and I want them to stand up.
[time=332] They're right in the front row, cameraman.
[time=334] You just need to get right over on their pretty faces so everybody can see them.
[time=338] Steve and Maria, we're glad to have you.
[time=340] God bless you for being with us.
[time=342] I hope the service will be an encouragement and a blessing to you.
[time=346] And then in the front row is the leader of Life Unlimited.
[time=349] He usually gets to direct, but because he would be flailing his arms away in view of the camera, we ask him to sit quietly.
[time=356] But David Clydesdale, would you stand please and let everyone see you turn around and let the folks know he leads this group.
[time=363] And let's give the Life Unlimited singers a good black hawk welcome as they come to ministry.
[time=369] [APPLAUSE]
[time=376] [MUSIC - 54 seconds]
[time=435] I see the goodness of the Lord that fill the earth with food.
[time=444] He for the creatures with his word, and then pronouns them good.
[time=454] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=496] The voice of the Lord is upon the waters. The glory of God funders and commands bolts of lightning.
[time=504] The Lord is over the seas. The voice of God is powerful. The voice of God is majestic.
[time=512] The heavens are telling of the glory and power of God.
[time=518] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=620] [APPLAUSE]
[time=631] We're so very happy that you joined us on the Bible hour today.
[time=635] And it is our privilege during this segment of our television program to sit and talk with you in an informal way.
[time=641] My partner for this time together is my wife Donna.
[time=644] Donna, I just returned from a very special trip to minister to seminary students in Dallas, Texas.
[time=651] I was overwhelmed as I shared with those young men and with their wives as well to discover and remember the loneliness that many of those men feel while they're in school.
[time=663] And especially as they think about getting out of school and going into their ministry. Do you remember those days?
[time=667] Oh, very well. I remember the fear that clutches your heart when you're not sure where you're going to be going to minister and if God has a place for you and if everything will fall together, it's really a scary time in your life.
[time=681] Well, it reminded me of just another whole segment of people who go through the experience of loneliness and excited me as I came back and found the completed edition of our little booklet called Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely.
[time=696] There are a lot of lonely people in the world today for many, many reasons.
[time=700] There certainly are, and it's so nice to know that you have a source that can give you the answer that you need for your loneliness.
[time=709] And as I was just glancing through the little booklet a few minutes ago, there are so many neat promises that God gives to us in his word.
[time=717] He says, "As an Exodus 33, 14, my presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. And in Deuteronomy 31, be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God, he it is that death go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
[time=738] And these are just a few of the great promises that God has given to us when we are in these lonely situations.
[time=744] And one of the interesting things is that when people are lonely and they're going through difficulty like that, they want to know where all those promises are.
[time=752] They don't want to have to look through their Bibles and find a promise here and a promise there.
[time=758] It's just such a great comfort to be able to take all of the promises and open a little booklet, and there they are, and you can read through them, and they're a great encouragement to you.
[time=766] And this little booklet called Psalms Promises and Prescriptions is a booklet that is divided into three sections, one section with passages from the Psalms that talk about some of the emotions of loneliness.
[time=779] And then all of those promises, like the ones you just read a few moments ago, and then finally some verses that are prescriptions.
[time=787] By that we mean, "What do I do because of my loneliness?" And there are a number of ideas from the Scriptures in that whole matter.
[time=794] Now, we'd like to send this booklet to you this week, and Donna, you tell them how we'll do that and what they need to do to get in touch with us.
[time=803] We'd be happy to send you a free copy of this handy little booklet, and all you need to do is call us at our toll-free number, 1-800-4539000.
[time=814] And if you know of a friend or a loved one who is going through a particularly lonely time in life and would like to have two copies, just ask for two, and we'd be happy to send you an extra one.
[time=824] That phone number again is 1-800-4539000.
[time=830] Just ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her you would like the booklet offered on today's broadcast.
[time=836] Or if you prefer, you may write to us. We always love to get your letters in the mail, and it's more of a two-way communication with us.
[time=843] And our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=852] And just tell us in the letter that you've watched the program, and on what station, and request the booklets, and we'll be happy to send them to you.
[time=859] Donna, we'd like to encourage all of our many friends, especially in the new areas where the Bible Hour is being seen in Springfield, Dayton, and in Terrell-Hote.
[time=866] To get in touch with us this week and let us know that they're receiving the Bible Hour in their area.
[time=871] We also want to remind them that this little booklet is especially appropriate for the holiday season when loneliness seems to weigh much heavier on the hearts of many people.
[time=880] So we'd like to hear from you this week, and we'd love to have the opportunity of extending the ministry of the Bible Hour into your home and into your heart through this special Bible tool, and we'll look forward to hearing from you this week.
[time=892] Once again, the phone number is 1-800-45-39000, and the address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46-815.
[time=904] We look forward to receiving communication from you this week, and we hope you'll stay with us now as we go back to our morning service for more music and a message from the Word of God.
[time=922] Be that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life. Be that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=948] God made him to be sin for us, who knew now sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[time=970] All we like sheep have gone astray, we all have sinned.
[time=981] Man must be perfect for him to enter in. Jesus said, give that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1002] Be that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1017] But to him, let's worketh not, but believe it on him.
[time=1028] He is come dead just as if he never seemed. If any man reach another gospel unto you.
[time=1049] Let him be our curse, because it is not true. Jesus said, give that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1070] Be that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1094] Be that, believe it on me. Happy, turn all the life. Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1113] Happy, turn all the life.
[time=1130] You know, I like music that is saturated with Scripture, and I was thinking all of the passages you were singing, some from Galatians, some from Romans, all over the New Testament, will one central message that if you want eternal life you must believe, and that's good.
[time=1153] I understand young people that this is your last day on tour. Is that correct? You're finishing up? Someone last Sunday. How long have you been out on the road since last January?
[time=1167] Oh my, have you ever traveled for a whole year with the same people?
[time=1177] Well, I'll tell you what, you've blessed our hearts already. You just have a great sound, and we're so glad you could share with us, even if it is at the end of your tour.
[time=1187] And we're grateful to God for bringing you here. Before I preach, I want you to sing again.
[time=1200] I will offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1225] Bless his name forevermore, and continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1240] The fruit of my lips shall be Hosanna, Hallelujah. The song in my heart, a melody of sweet communion.
[time=1259] I will lift my voice unto the Lord. Bless his name forevermore, and continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1279] I'll not love him only when he blesses me with sunshine. But all through the storm give thanks and praise his wisdom so divine.
[time=1298] I will lift my voice unto the Lord. Bless his name forevermore, and continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1318] Hosanna, praise the Lord, Hallelujah.
[time=1338] Praise the Lord, Hosanna, Hallelujah. And continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1352] Hosanna, praise the Lord, Hallelujah.
[time=1374] Hosanna, Hallelujah. And continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1385] Hosanna, praise the Lord, Hallelujah.
[time=1403] Hosanna, praise the Lord, Hallelujah. And continually offer up the sacrifice of praise.
[time=1423] Of praise.
[time=1453] We appreciate here in this church when things are done right, and they do it right. That's great.
[time=1476] I want you to open your Bibles now and let's turn together to the book of 1 Timothy. 1 Timothy.
[time=1489] We are in the midst of Stewardship Month. We're teaching the principles of the Word of God that have to do with giving and stewardship of life.
[time=1500] It's a broad, sweeping doctrine that touches us in many areas, and I probably shouldn't say this because of the folks who watch on television, but this is a two-part sermon.
[time=1513] I'm going to speak this morning on the first half of the text and tonight on the second half.
[time=1519] This morning I'm going to preach on the problem and the peril of getting money and tonight on the privilege of giving it.
[time=1527] And so if you only get the bottom half, you're going to get the dangers without any of the blessings, which gives me an opportunity to say that if you're watching this television live in the local area, you want to get the second half, you'll have to come tonight.
[time=1542] And it's not on television. You'll have to be here.
[time=1545] And this morning we're going to deal with 1 Timothy chapter 6, beginning at the third verse, and I'd like to have you open your Bibles with me and share with me as we read together 1 Timothy chapter 6 verses 3 through 10.
[time=1561] But if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing but doting about questions and disputes of words of which come with envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions.
[time=1580] Perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness from such withdrawal thyself.
[time=1590] But godliness with contentment is great gain, but we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out, and having food and raiment let us be there with content.
[time=1601] But they that will be rich fall into temptation in a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and tradition.
[time=1611] For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
[time=1624] Shall we pray together? God help us to understand thy word today in its context, in its meaning, as you would direct it to our hearts, that we might know what the word says, that we might know what it means, that we might know what it is saying to us in our lives by way of application.
[time=1647] And that we might in response to that be not hearers of the word only but doers, to go out and fulfill in our lives the truth which we hear today.
[time=1657] Let thy word be a warning to some and encouragement to others, to all of us a challenge and conviction for our life.
[time=1667] In Jesus name I pray, amen. The text which I have read this morning is a very interesting passage of Scripture in that the central idea is in the middle of the passage of Scripture.
[time=1684] There is truth which is leading up to it before the central idea, there is truth which leads away from it after the central idea, but all of it is wrapped around the same general theme.
[time=1695] And that theme is expressed in verses 6 and 8 of the text. There is a maxim or corollary and then a word of definition to explain its terms.
[time=1708] First of all verse 6 says godliness with contentment is great gain. That teaches us that that philosophy of life is at the core of good living, of happy living and of meaningful life.
[time=1723] Godliness with contentment is great gain. Then verse 8 explains to us what contentment is.
[time=1733] If we were to translate that in our present understanding of the word we would say then that godliness plus the necessities of life provide great benefit or they are good and gainful in life.
[time=1755] Now obviously when the text speaks of food and raiment it's talking about in its description the necessities of living.
[time=1764] Someone has amplified that understanding a bit further by saying that the necessities of life relate to what we put on our clothes and what we put in our food and what we put up our houses and what we put away a little bit to provide for the future for our children
[time=1784] and our families. So the concept of contentment is pretty well wrapped up in those four phrases what I put on and what I put in and what I put up and what I put away.
[time=1795] Now when you get outside of those four basic things you have moved out of the arena of the necessity and into the area of luxury where I might say most of us already live.
[time=1808] But Paul is saying to Timothy that the man who has come to understand what it means to be godly and has the necessities of life that man is a happy man.
[time=1821] Now history is certainly replete with illustrations of those who have tried it the other way and have failed.
[time=1827] Years ago H. G. Wells historian and philosopher who had gained everything that this life could gain for anyone individual said I have no peace all of my life is at the end of its tether.
[time=1840] That's how he described it. Henry David Thoreau made this observation as he wrote that most men live lives of quiet desperation.
[time=1850] Ralph Barton said I've had few difficulties in my life many friends great successes and a lot of money but I've gone from wife to wife and from house to house visited great countries of the world and frankly I'm fed up with trying to invent new ways to fill up 24 hours of every day.
[time=1872] Lord Byron wrote it this way he said my days are in the yellow leaf the flowers and the fruits are gone and worms and cankers and grief are mine alone.
[time=1886] What a description of life summer set mon wrote when he was about 90 years of age these words he said what makes old age so hard for me to bear is the burden of my memories.
[time=1904] When I look back on my life it seems to me strangely lacking in any reality it may be that my heart having found rest nowhere else had some deep ancestral craving for God which my mind would not let me accept.
[time=1922] How many men would be described in terms like that and so they go through all their lives empty seeking to find fulfillment in the things and the traffic of this world and they come up dry every time.
[time=1937] That's why Paul in writing to Timothy warns him in this passage of scripture that it is possible in life to take one of two directions there is a phrase in the text we read which says some people think that gain is godliness.
[time=1953] I know folks like that I've heard an evangelist preach that doctrine green is beautiful.
[time=1965] If you have money you've got it made. If you're rich you're righteous.
[time=1974] But the Bible says if you go that route you're headed in a direction of total destruction.
[time=1980] In antithesis to that he brings us back to the core of our argument for today's passage and that is that godliness and the necessities of life that's where it's at.
[time=1994] That's where joy is where life is where meaning is we have to make a choice.
[time=2001] Now in the passage he has five reasons why the godliness plus contentment philosophy of life is right why it's the thing we ought to pursue.
[time=2011] Some of them come before the statement some of them come after the ones before the statement tell us why that that philosophy is right because of the problems in the other life and the ones after it remind us of all the benefits that accrue to us when we take to ourselves
[time=2029] the concept that I'm going to put priority on God and taking care of the necessities of my life.
[time=2036] Now let's notice those reasons first of all godliness plus contentment in that philosophy of life rests completely upon God's word any other philosophy pushes the word of God aside.
[time=2048] Notice what he says in verse three if any man teach otherwise and consent not to hold some words even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.
[time=2064] There is the possibility for a person not to consent to the concept of godliness plus contentment and in doing so to push the word of God aside and no longer to find joy in the word of God and in the words of Christ.
[time=2081] He says he consents not to wholesome words the word wholesome is a word which is translated in some text by the word hygienic or healthy he no longer will listen to the healthy words of Christ he's pushed him out of his life.
[time=2094] There is something about the philosophy of materialism which does not coincide with a deep commitment to the scripture.
[time=2102] For you see when you read the Bible and you open its pages you find there in every way possible the warnings against materialism and secularism as a philosophy of life and with one takes the choice to live in that realm and pursue that as his goal he begins to be very uncomfortable as he reads the scripture and he won't consent any longer to the wholesome words of Christ.
[time=2123] There are some men who as Christians live as if there were no god.
[time=2129] They go through the motions they have been born again they are saved they're on their way to heaven but they've been caught up in the traffic of the world on its way toward an unrealistic goal of happiness through materialism and they live as if God weren't around anymore.
[time=2148] I read this week a very exciting book which I would recommend to you for the warming up of your own devotional life a book written by Sherwood Elliot Wert on the 42nd and 43rd Psalm called a thirst for God and it was really a blessing to my own life.
[time=2168] And in one chapter one of the chapters of that book he talks about the concept of the phrase in the 42nd Psalm that says there is no God.
[time=2181] And he makes the point in his discussion that most people who say there is no God really are not atheists they're not saying God doesn't exist what they're saying is there is no God here.
[time=2193] There's no God where I am in my problems in my difficulties and he quotes in his writings a professor Bailey from London who makes this persuasive case for the claim that people who insist that they don't believe in God really do.
[time=2209] They believe in him in the bottom of their heart but somehow the bottom of their heart doesn't change the way they live it never gets out to the exterior.
[time=2218] They've got a head knowledge and a heart knowledge but it doesn't affect the way they live.
[time=2224] And they walk around in a world claiming intellectually that God is a part of their life but it never makes any difference.
[time=2234] He made us aware in his writing of the fact that there are 96% of the North Americans who profess to believe in God and so they wouldn't say where is God they would say why isn't God here because they don't live like God exists in their life.
[time=2252] And Paul is saying to Timothy that a man who does not accept godliness as the pursuit of his life with contentment through the provision of his necessities and gets on the materialistic tram of life toward the unrealistic goal of happiness through money that man has become a practical atheist.
[time=2273] He may be a Christian but you can be a Christian and a practical atheist. A practical atheist is someone who believes in God and has accepted Christ but lives his life every day as if there were no God alive.
[time=2290] Paul says that godliness plus contentment rests completely upon God's word and the antithesis is if you don't want to accept that you're going to be moving gradually more and more away from the word.
[time=2304] Now notice secondly that godliness plus contentment as a philosophy of life rescues man from moral decay.
[time=2312] Notice in verses 4 and 5 this kind of a person who doesn't accept this the Bible says he is proud.
[time=2320] Now you wouldn't have to say anything more because in my estimation those three words are at the bottom of about 90% of the problems in the life of a Christian.
[time=2331] He is proud.
[time=2333] You see he's already pushed God out of the picture now he's set the word of God on the shelf out here. So what is the antithesis? What is the result of that? It's me. I'm doing it.
[time=2344] I know God is out there but he doesn't affect what I do. I'm the one that goes out and make the sales. I'm the ones that, you know, it's me. I'm proud.
[time=2351] And what does the Scripture say? He's proud and yet he's ignorant. He knows nothing.
[time=2358] His attitude is one of pride and ignorance and his attitude plays itself out in his actions. Notice what his actions are. The Scriptures describe his action as envy and strife and railings and evil suspicions. What's wrong with this man?
[time=2374] This man has divided himself in his heart and he hasn't got a central focus on life. He is claiming intellectually that God is on the throne of his life but his lifestyle won't buy that. And so there's struggle inside and he's got all kinds of problems and he's on his way down the moral slide away from righteous living.
[time=2398] And interestingly enough, and I think Paul put this in here just for Christians within the church. He says that what happens when a man begins to live this way with a double commitment to life, he starts arguing over non-essentials. Isn't that interesting? Notice.
[time=2415] It says in verse 5, let's go back to verse 4, "He dotes about questions and disputes of words, of which comeeth envy, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds. I went back through the Pauline epistles and I discovered how often Paul warned against idiotic discussions about meaningless things."
[time=2438] I have to honestly say I just came from the seminary. I suppose more meaningless discussions about peripheral theological subjects take place in seminary coffee shops than any place else in the whole world.
[time=2453] Now, you know, if you'd go back and find those same men 10 years out into the ministry, you discover they're talking about different things. It's fun to discuss all of the great theological battles. But I want you to notice in 2 Timothy 2, 14, Paul says to Timothy, they that strive not about words to no profit.
[time=2474] In Titus, he warns young Titus, he says, "Avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable in their vain." There's that pride theme again.
[time=2492] In 2 Timothy 2, 16, he says, "But foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strife. We are according to the word of God to shun, profane and vain babblings. When a man has pushed the word of God aside, he has divided his own heart in terms of his commitment. He no longer wants to talk about the main issue. He wants to talk about beside issues because there's no conviction in those things.
[time=2518] I read this week about two professors who were arguing over the grammatical correctness of whether or not the hen was sitting or the hen was setting.
[time=2533] Unable to agree, they asked Farmer Jones what he thought.
[time=2538] Farmer Jones replied, "The question of sitting and setting I cannot answer. Nor do I care. What I want to know is when the hen cackles is she laying or lying."
[time=2556] I kind of agree with Farmer Jones. Sometimes we split all of these issues out here in the peripheral, and we are like the old philosophers who wanted to argue over how many angels could be balanced on the head of one pin, and it doesn't make any difference.
[time=2575] When a man divides his life at the core and he begins to live for this world half-time and that world half-time pretty soon, he no longer wants to talk about the main issue, he begins the moral slide and it changes the whole context of his life.
[time=2592] Do you ever notice how basic new Christians are? How basic they are?
[time=2599] I know we need to grow in maturity and develop in our lives and learn more things and grow and knowledge the word tells us that and I don't want to discount that at all.
[time=2607] But I believe God would have us to maintain some of that old basicness.
[time=2611] You know what? We have a young man in our church who had just been saved a few months and he started carrying his Bible to work with him and reading his Bible where he works.
[time=2621] You know what I told him? He said, "I'm going to try to keep you away from all the rest of the Christians because pretty soon someone will be telling you you shouldn't do that."
[time=2628] He just believes that's what he ought to do. He's to the basics.
[time=2632] I don't want to get off the subject here, but I just want to encourage you that the basics never change.
[time=2637] We add to them out here, but we need to stay on focus.
[time=2640] All right, let's notice thirdly that this man who is committed to godliness and contentment is the philosophy of his life.
[time=2649] First of all, we notice that he has a lifestyle which rests completely upon the word of God.
[time=2655] And secondly, we learn that because of this he's being rescued from the moral slide which the contrary person is going through.
[time=2663] Thirdly, we learn in verse 7 that this lifestyle results in building up a reward in heaven.
[time=2670] Now we talked about that through the whole sermon last week, so we'll not spend time here except to remind you that here the phrase is again for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
[time=2682] Why do we want to live for that which perishes when we die?
[time=2686] Why not put our hope on godliness which goes on beyond the grave as we build into our own lives the principles that are a part of that lifestyle?
[time=2696] And tonight in our service we're going to talk a little bit more about this, but notice verse 19 in the same text reminds us that we as Christians are to be laying up in store for ourselves a good foundation against the time to come.
[time=2710] A person who has committed himself to godliness and provides the means whereby he can have comfort in the things we discussed earlier.
[time=2720] That man has decided he's not going to live for this world, he's going to live for the world to come, for you see he knows you can't take anything with you when you go.
[time=2729] That's true from the book of Job, that's true from the book of Ecclesiastes, that's true from the book of Matthew and that's true from the book of Timothy, you can't take it with you.
[time=2739] And so he understands that and he begins to live for the world where he's headed instead of the world where he will die.
[time=2749] Now notice fourthly that this man who has committed himself to this kind of a lifestyle is the kind of a man then who will be by the way he lives reducing the opportunities of temptation in his life.
[time=2765] Now wait a minute, is that possible? Yes it is, it's possible to solely live and have a lifestyle that will reduce the possibility of temptation in your life.
[time=2775] Notice what it says in verse 9, "For they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition."
[time=2792] Now let me explain to you what's going on in this verse. First of all I want you to notice the words "they that will be rich."
[time=2801] The Bible does not say here that the rich fall into temptation, doesn't say that.
[time=2807] It says "they that will be rich fall into temptation." It is the concept of a person who is not necessarily rich but desires to be so so very intently that he lives his whole life as the word covetousness expresses in its original meaning.
[time=2826] The word covetous means to be stretched out in pursuit of something. I've talked to some of the realtors who are in our church and they tell me that out here where we live in this wonderful part of the city where there are some nicer homes.
[time=2845] That there are just hundreds and hundreds of young couples who are living in homes they can't afford to live in.
[time=2853] Who have jeopardized their future and their life and their health and everything else to get into a package that will portray to the outside world that they have something they don't have.
[time=2867] Isn't it interesting that those who will be rich oftentimes are not the rich they're the ones who are striving for it and sometimes the wealthy people get the reputation of those who will be rich and that's not fair to them.
[time=2880] The fact is I've met a lot of wealthy people who live a very simple lifestyle and if you didn't see their bank book you wouldn't know they had any money.
[time=2888] They've learned how to be content in their lifestyle. So the text is not talking about rich people it's talking about people who may be trying to be ten dollars richer than they are but the scripture says that kind of a person who lives his life in pursuit of wealth notice
[time=2905] now he falls and the word fall there is a present tense word which means he keeps on falling down all the time he just keeps right on falling he falls and falls and he falls into temptation and into a snare.
[time=2920] Oh how I know people like that and I watch them my heart cries out to them just a little bit more somebody said how rich is enough and the answer of course is just a little bit richer than I am just a little bit more just a little more than I've got
[time=2941] and they sacrifice their families and their life and everything that's meaningful in terms of the spiritual notice what the scripture says about them they drowned.
[time=2953] The word drowned is the word buthizo and it is a picture that I can't paint for you in the English language like I would like to but I'll do the best I can it is the picture of an evil monster who plunges his victim down into an ocean of complete destruction and
[time=2972] tradition. It is the picture of an evil monster who clutches its victim and plunges him down into an ocean of destruction and perdition and those last two words carry with them the context and the concept of irretrievable loss so that he can't recover.
[time=2994] This is a Christian person we're talking about. It's possible to be a Christian materialist and a drowned in the pursuit of wealth.
[time=3015] Last but not least the text reminds us that a person who has committed himself to godliness plus contentment as his lifestyle.
[time=3025] This person now listen carefully. This person removes the root I believe the major root of backsliding in the Christian life.
[time=3037] You say Pastor Jeremiah we're in the world and you get that notice what it says in verse 11 verse 10 for the love of money is the root of all evil.
[time=3050] Now listen which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith.
[time=3062] This is the phrase which describes an apostate. They have moved away from the doctrine of the word of God. They have turned their back on the truth.
[time=3073] I'm not debating their ultimate salvation. That's not the issue. They have backslidden. They have walked away from God. They have turned their back on God. They have erred from the truth.
[time=3086] I don't know if anyone's ever done a study and I certainly wouldn't propose to do one.
[time=3093] But I would believe in my own heart that if the truth could be known that the way many men especially have walked away from God in their life is this very thing.
[time=3106] They have gotten caught up in the money game and the complete commitment to more and more and more and little by little God was squeezed out of their life and now they have erred from the truth.
[time=3120] My heart bleeds when I think of a friend of mine on the west coast who has turned his back on everything he knows and on his family and on his priorities.
[time=3133] Because he got caught up in the world's system and fame and prestige and honor and money and he's erred from the faith.
[time=3145] The Scripture says that a man who has erred from the faith, listen now, that man is pierced through with many sorrows.
[time=3155] Have you ever known anybody that's erred from the faith? Have you ever wept with anyone who has erred from the faith?
[time=3165] I have. There is no sorrow like the sorrow of a man who has known the blessed love of God in the center of God's will and for whatever reason has turned his back upon it to walk the way of the world.
[time=3182] I know the Bible is filled with illustrations of people who did that. Did you know that?
[time=3188] Back in the seventh chapter of the book of Joshua is the story of a man by the name of Aiken who went out to war with the people of Israel and when he saw the riches of the enemy which the law forbid him to take, he reached out with the covetous hand of avarice and he took those things to himself and hid them in his own tent because he wanted more than he had.
[time=3209] And the result was that when his army went to do battle the next day because of his sin they were defeated and ultimately Joshua brought that man before the company and found out who did it and he confessed his sin and he was stoned.
[time=3224] And he moved to the New Testament. Follow the Lord in his path and discover that one of those who walked so intimately with him was a man by the name of Judas who the scripture says held the bag who criticized Mary when she lavishly loved her Lord with the gift of her magnanimous love.
[time=3246] And the one who according to the scripture because he wanted more than he had for 30 pieces of silver sold the blessed Lord Jesus into the hand of the Romans so that he was crucified.
[time=3259] And the scripture records that Judas when he realized what he had done was pierced through with the sorrow and he went out and hung himself.
[time=3268] And his body having been hung fell headlong over a cliff and burst asunder.
[time=3276] And the rich man who came to Jesus one night and said Lord what must I do to inherit eternal life as if by some deed he could buy it.
[time=3286] And Jesus said knowing where his priorities were go and sell all that you have and give it to the poor and come and we'll talk about it again.
[time=3295] And the Bible says that the rich man was not willing to let go of what he had and so he walked away and the Bible says he walked away sad.
[time=3305] And what about the sixth chapter of the book of Acts?
[time=3309] The story of a young couple in the early church by the name of Ananias and Sephira who following the lead of a good man by the name of Barnabas decided they would like to give sacrificially to the Lord's work.
[time=3322] And whereas Barnabas took his property and sold it and gave all to the Lord they took it, told the church they were giving all and kept back part of it for themselves.
[time=3332] Because they couldn't part with what they had.
[time=3337] And the Bible says that within a matter of just a few moments both of them were ushered out of this life.
[time=3345] Men and women to put your life in the hands and the clutches of materialism as opposed to God and his plan is to ruin your life and to pierce it through with sorrow which many times is irretriable.
[time=3364] And the message from God to all of us today is there's a better way. Godliness plus contentment is a great gain. Shall we pray?
