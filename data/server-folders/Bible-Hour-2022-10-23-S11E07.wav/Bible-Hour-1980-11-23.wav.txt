[time=0] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne,
[time=6] Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=10] [MUSIC]
[time=23] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=28] And we welcome you to this hour and this ministry of the Word of God in music.
[time=33] We're thankful for all of you who have joined us here in the Convocation Center in the second service of our worship program here, and especially now in this hour all of you who have joined us by way of television to share in our worship together of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We begin our worship this morning
[time=51] with the ministry of music from the sanctuary choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they sing for us, "Take My Life."
[time=60] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=191] That is the prayer of our hearts, especially during this time of the year, in the
[time=202] ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, when we are studying together and teaching the subject of stewardship. And we're praying that God will help us to understand what it means to be involved in total commitment to Him with our time and our talent and our treasure. On this particular Sunday we were supposed to have with us as our special guest, the Dick Anthony family.
[time=227] And this past week we received a phone call from the people who take care of scheduling them, telling us that on Friday Dick Anthony had an emergency surgery, a gallbladder surgery, and he would not be able to come and they would not be able to be with us. Now those kind of things have happened to us before and when they do we just sort of say well God has something special he wanted to do and he interrupted our plans to do what he wanted to do. And what he's going to do I'm sure is bless us in a wonderful way through the ministry of our own musicians.
[time=260] And we're going to listen first of all to Mr. Keith Brodigam who sings for us often and is always a blessing to us. He's a very fine musician with a heart for God and communicates the things of the Lord and his music as well as anyone I've ever heard.
[time=276] We're glad that you were here and that your person who schedules you was able to make it possible for you to be with us Keith. God bless you.
[time=302] Where there is hatred let me fall in love
[time=317] Where there is injury brought on
[time=323] Where there is doubt faith
[time=330] Where there is despair called Where there is darkness light
[time=342] Where there is sadness joy
[time=351] oh divine master grant that I may not
[time=360] for what's made to become so as to become so
[time=370] to be understood as to understand
[time=377] to be loved as to love
[time=384] for it is in giving
[time=391] that we receive
[time=398] that is in pardon
[time=404] that we are part of
[time=410] that is in delight
[time=417] that we are born to eternal life
[time=434] we're so happy that you've joined us on the bible hour today
[time=446] and especially that we have this opportunity to sit together and talk with you at home in this very informal time joining me in this particular part of our television program is my wife Donna and Donna I'm so glad that you're willing to do this it's so much more meaningful when we can talk together to our friends at home it's really a special time for me because it's an opportunity for more of a two-way communication and I have a little booklet that I want to discuss with you in a moment but I know my husband has something he wants to share with you first Donna I recently wrote a letter to all of our friends at home and most of you who are part of the bible hour ministry have received that letter already or if not we'll be receiving it in a few days it's a letter announcing a special missionary project that we're involved in at this particular time of the year one of our missionaries Dan Smith serves God along the Amazon River in Peru and when he was home recently shared with us some of the needs he had there and in a recent conversation with him on the telephone he told us about many of the people he ministers to in the small villages along that river who have been taught to read many of whom have come to know Christ personally many of whom have not even one copy of the scripture that they can use in between his visits so we have decided as a bible hour ministry that we're going to reach out to help Dan during this time and it is our desire to send 2,400 copies of the scripture into the villages along the Amazon River making it possible for him to touch base with these people teaching them how to read the scripture and then leave a copy of the scripture in at least every village and hopefully more than one in these villages so that they can share together the reading of the word of God when you receive that letter or if you've already received it i hope you will consider what you can do to help us help Dan we'll find great joy at this season of the year to reach out from the bible hour ministry to help him as he ministers to people there in that foreign land now for the booklet that i'm excited to share with you it's called Psalms Promises and Prescriptions and what it is is just scriptures from the word of God that pertain to people who are lonely at this time of year who perhaps are experiencing a sorrow and it just has some neat promises and answers from God's word so many times when we are in the midst of a problem in our own life the bible is a big book and sometimes it's difficult to put our hands on passages of scripture that would be the most meaningful to us at that time and i was just glancing it at one page in the booklet and at some of the promises that are given given there the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid and another one in Psalms when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up and there are just many many others they're meaningful when we are going through a particularly difficult time in our lives and we would like to send you a free copy of this booklet and all you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1-800-4539000 and we'd be more than happy to send a copy to you and if you have maybe a friend who has just recently accepted christ and would like to have an extra copy for them we'd be happy to do that too Donna we've already received hundreds of requests for this book since it's been made available to our friends at home and it is beginning to look like it's going to be one of those special gifts that is very popular with our bible our ministry friends so if you want to receive your free copy you better call or write us while we still have a supply of them so that we can send one to you absolutely free the booklet psalms promises and prescriptions for the lonely is available to you absolutely free by calling 1-800-4539000 and requesting your free copy if you prefer to write you may write to me pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815 we'll be happy to send your copy of this free booklet

[time=928] This Sunday at our church, of course, is Thanksgiving Sunday The week before Thanksgiving Most of you who get this program in other places Thanksgiving has already passed But that was a good Thanksgiving song Reminding us that we should be praising God with our lives Last night, the young men who represent our school From the Black Hawk Christian School Had the opportunity to play the Crestview School over in Ohio The first public school we have ever played Since we've been in the basketball program here And this is our first year to have seniors in our school And our young men did so very well I was proud of them and of our coach They did not quite have enough at the end and we lost But what I wanted to say today was that the young men from that school And especially their coach, Mr. Raymond Etzler Were a real encouragement to us I had the opportunity to walk down into the locker room after the game To say hello to Raymond, a young man that I played basketball against in college Back a few years ago And when I walked in, I heard him praying with his boys And I tell you something, if you happen to live in the Crestview area And watch this television program and you got a young man in that school You ought to thank God for your coach Because he's a man of God and he has done a tremendous job there And influencing young men And I'm proud to know him as my friend And grateful for the privilege we've had To develop a relationship between our school and theirs I believe that this week, some of the administrators from their school Are going to be here visiting with us And seeing what God is doing here in our school operation And I'm grateful We haven't heard from Starr Narwald in a long time We haven't taken her off the music list, she's not under discipline But she's been so very busy out singing for all of the rest of the saints
[time=1041] That we haven't had a chance to hear And I'm glad you stayed home a weekend to share with us, Starr And God bless you as you sing
[time=1056] Is it any wonder?
[time=1069] When I think how Jesus loved me How he waited patiently Even when I turned my back and walked away When he knew I wanted everything This world could offer me Then I guess he knew the price I'd have to pay So he watched me stumble downward Saw each compromise I made For each lie I whispered just to get my way
[time=1105] Still he waited there to hear me When I cried to him and prayed Then he saved my soul and this is what I say
[time=1117] Tell me is it any wonder that I love him
[time=1124] When you consider all he's done for me
[time=1130] And is that any wonder that I want to do his will
[time=1136] To let his light shine out for all to see
[time=1142] And is that any wonder that I praise him
[time=1148] Each time I think of how he's made me free
[time=1154] And is that any wonder that I've given him my heart
[time=1160] When Jesus really gave his life for me
[time=1169] Is it any wonder?
[time=1187] When I think how Jesus loves me How he watches patiently How his arms are stretched to meet me when I run
[time=1199] And when I'm feeling down and lonely He is there to comfort me In my darkness he becomes the morning sun
[time=1212] And when I think of how he's healed me How he's touched me in my pain How his gentle hands are wiped my tears away
[time=1225] When he's taken every heartache And brought happiness again Then I want the world to hear me when I say
[time=1237] Tell me is it any wonder That I love him when you consider all he's done for me
[time=1250] And is that any wonder that I want to do his will
[time=1256] To let his light shine out for all to see
[time=1262] And is that any wonder that I praise him
[time=1268] Each time I think of how he's made me free
[time=1274] And is that any wonder that I've given him my heart
[time=1281] When Jesus freely gave his life for me
[time=1300] Thank you, Starr. It is so good to have musicians who are sensitive
[time=1310] To the Spirit of God and when we are teaching and thinking about a certain theme They pick that right up and continue the communication process through the ministry of music
[time=1321] Well, let's open our Bibles this morning to the Book of Philippians And the fourth chapter Philippians chapter four And I want to read Beginning at the tenth verse And reading through the 19th verse Philippians chapter four Verses 10 through 19 And you follow in your Bibles as I read from mine But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly That now at the last your care of me hath flourished again Of which you were also mindful but she lacked opportunity Not that I speak in respect of what, for I have learned in whatever state I am In this to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry Both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me Notwithstanding you have well done that you did share with my affliction Now you Philippians know that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia No church shared with me as concerning giving and receiving but she only For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity Not because I desire a gift but I desire fruit that may abound to your account But I have all and abound I am full Having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you An odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing to God
[time=1418] But my God shall supply all your need According to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus shall we pray together
[time=1430] Our God in heaven we thank thee at this hour For the provision of the word of God which liveth and abideth forever
[time=1439] Which is sharper than any two-edged sword Which bears with it the promise that wherever it is sown It shall return unto the bearing that fruit for which it was sent
[time=1451] We are grateful our Father that it is the cleansing agent That comes into our lives to bring conviction of sin And cause confession that we might be clean before the We're grateful that it deals not only with deep and lofty spiritual truths
[time=1470] But also with the practical application of those truths to our own lives Telling us not only what to do but how to do it We're grateful our Father for the instruction we have received from thy word during this month Concerning our responsibility as stewards of God and of his grace And we pray that in these moments during this message You will speak to our hearts, enlighten us, encourage us, instruct us We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, Amen
[time=1504] It is told of Leonardo da Vinci That while he was still a pupil before his genius burst into brilliancy
[time=1517] He received a special inspiration in this way His old and famous master because of his growing infirmities of age Felt obliged to give up his own work One day he called da Vinci and asked him to finish for him a picture which he had recently begun
[time=1539] The young man had such a reverence for his master's skill And believed in his accomplishment as an artist so well That he shrank from the task But his master would not take no for an answer and he said to Leonardo That he would not accept any excuse He persisted in his command simply saying do your best, do your best
[time=1563] According to the story da Vinci at last tremblingly seized the brush And he kneeled before the easel and began to pray And he prayed it is for the sake of my beloved master That I implore skill and power for this undertaking
[time=1581] As he began to paint his hand grew steadily more secure
[time=1587] And his eye awoke with slumbering genius He forgot himself for those moments as he was painting And he was filled with enthusiasm as he completed the picture which his master had started
[time=1600] When the painting was finished the old master was brought into the room To see the finished product To pass judgment on the result As his eye passed over the canvas that had been painted By his pupil he threw his arms around the young boy and he exclaimed
[time=1620] My son I paint no more There are some of us who when the master bids us get involved
[time=1632] We say I can't I'm not worthy I'm not able There is no way for me to be involved And the master continues to say to us through the word of God But you must it is my instruction to you I am imploring you to get involved in helping me Finish the work which has been begun in my world And sometimes when we hear the challenge of the word of God
[time=1661] We like Leonardo da Vinci take the work in our hands tremblingly at first And we begin to paint until we get lost in the thrill of the master
[time=1674] Who fills our lives and before we know it it is no longer us doing the work But it is the master doing it through us And alas the product that is produced is not ours but his
[time=1686] We become in essence a living embodiment of God's work in this world
[time=1693] Such is the message of stewardship that's what we've been trying to teach throughout this entire month that God would have us Simply be channels through whom he can work to carry out his work in this world
[time=1707] We are the body of Christ and it is interesting to me that what the body of
[time=1713] Christ is called upon to do in the world in which we live today is simply to Duplicate in many ways that which Christ did in his own physical body while he was
[time=1724] Here upon this earth as he reached out to meet the needs of people and minister To lost and dying men now he has communicated that message To his body the church and he is saying to us the need is there and it must be met
[time=1738] One of the problems that the church has in meeting the need That is so prevalent in the world today is getting people to understand How that need is to be met not too long ago I received a letter from a lady
[time=1752] Who watches our television program and receives the mail that comes from our Office oftentimes on a regular basis in fact we send mail to the people who are A part of the ministry telling them of the need of the television ministry We do not ever ask for ourselves or for our own benefit but simply that we Might continue to be used of God to meet the needs of people through this Media this woman wrote back and she said to me
[time=1780] Pastor if God were in this work you would not have to ask You would not have to make the need known If God were in the work he would directly meet the need
[time=1794] I've heard that before that is not new to me But you know as I evaluate the ministry of this church over these past 11 years God has not ever directly met any need
[time=1810] Oh he's met every need but he has never done it Directly I've never walked into my office on a given Monday morning and found their stacks of bills piled high with the message from God dropped to you this day from cloud nine that you might meet the needs this Week how does God meet the need of his people and of his work
[time=1833] I could not help but notice in this text from what we have read today that in the juxtaposition of two verses there are the truths of the deep
[time=1844] spiritual resources of God and the practical application of stewardship
[time=1850] through God's people notice chapter four and verse 13
[time=1856] Paul says I can do all things through Christ
[time=1862] which strengtheneth me we love that verse that's a great verse of scripture that says to us my source is God my supply is the Lord Jesus I can do everything through him I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me and Paul said that and I believe that but notice the next verse not withstanding
[time=1885] you have well done that she did share with my affliction now wait a minute Paul if Christ is the source what in the world do you need of the Philippians if he is the source of all of your strength why it's not necessary for the Philippians to share with you why don't you just ask God Paul and let him meet your need how did God meet his need he met it through the Philippians don't you see it
[time=1913] Paul was able to say the need in my life has been met and God met that need through the ministry of the Philippians who communicated or shared with me now this whole passage of scripture that we're studying today deals with how God meets the need of his ministry
[time=1932] as it goes on in his world today and there are several things that we need to note as we study the passage of scripture together first of all will you notice in verse 14 the purpose of their giving the purpose of their giving it says in verse 14 you have well done that she did share with my affliction
[time=1955] now an affliction is a need it's a problem it's a difficulty Paul said I had a need I had an affliction and you ministered to that need you helped me we learned from the context that his need had some monetary ramifications the Philippians helped his affliction by giving money to help him do the work that God had called him to do
[time=1977] it's interesting as we learn about needs that needs have many faces
[time=1985] for instance in the bible in the Old Testament in the Psalms in chapter four in the fourth Psalm verse one the psalmist says thou has enlarged me when I was in distress now distress that's a need that's like affliction affliction in distress the psalmist says the same thing later on in Psalm 118 verse five where we read I called upon the Lord in distress and he answered me distress now that's a need when Paul was writing to the Corinthians in second Corinthians chapter 12 verses 9 and 10 that passage that deals with his thorn in the flesh listen to the words that are multiplied to describe Paul's situation he said it was weakness it was infirmity it was reproach it was necessity it was persecution and it was distress now those are all words that describe needs
[time=2041] Paul had some needs Romans chapter 13 and verse five tells us or chapter five
[time=2047] and verse three that we should glory in our tribulations in our needs and what the bible is teaching us in this context is that it is positive to be needy nobody ever said that to me before I have an awful time getting positive
[time=2068] about needs but the text says that god ministers to his people
[time=2076] when there is a need Paul said you helped me in my affliction and I want you to jump down in the text to that great promise verse which will come to later verse 19 and notice what it says but my god shall supply all of your wants all of your what
[time=2096] your needs have you got any needs today
[time=2102] all right let's take inventory how many of you have any needs let me see your hand got any needs well you're in better shape than I am most of you don't have many needs just a few and they're kind of tentative well all of you who were honest
[time=2118] and raised your hands and the rest of you who were dishonest and didn't the bible has a special promise for you it says that because you have a need god wants to get involved with you because god is in the ministry of meeting needs that's his purpose that's his program that's his priority meeting needs in the ministry of this church there are many needs
[time=2149] and if those needs are going to be met they have to be known notice Paul says in the text that the Philippians knew about his need they heard about it they knew about it they got involved with it and they were used of god to meet it now whenever we communicate a need in the ministry we're simply saying here's a need in the work of god and maybe god would like you to be a channel through which he can meet that need so that the cause of christ can go forward i don't understand why people get upset when someone says to them here's a need would you like to have a part in meeting it now no one's saying you have to do it god is saying here's an opportunity do you want to be involved in meeting that need and that's what this passage is all about he's talking here about the purpose of giving the purpose of giving is need centered and when we have a need god uses his children to meet that need even though he is the ultimate source the purpose of giving is to meet the need now notice and we'll pass over this quickly that in this context there is a picture of the persistence in giving there is an interesting progression of verses here progression of truths verse 10 but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at last your care of me has flourished again you see the Philippians had been involved in helping paul and then they had stopped and now they've gotten involved again notice verse 14 you did share with my affliction in the past notice verse 15 you know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church helped me but you only you did it notice verse 16 and this is the good part but in thessalonica you sent once and again unto mine there's the word again my necessity paul said there was a time in the past when you didn't do so well but you've gotten involved again in meeting my need and you're doing it consistently once and again over and over again my need is being met through you people paul is saying as a minister of the gospel my needs are being met through the Philippians god was using him spiritually to bless the Philippians and they were receiving
[time=2293] and they were taking what they had monetarily and giving it back to paul and he was receiving it was a giving and receiving kind of relationship there was persistence continuity in their giving relationship they had
[time=2308] some trouble in the past but now it had gotten on a straight pattern again and they were doing it over and over again consistently giving
[time=2316] the persistence of giving you know it's awful easy to start anything it's not so easy to continue some of you may think that paul has described your stewardship relationship in this passage you flourished in the past but you kind of dropped off and now during this month god has been speaking to your heart and you're getting back into it again and you're going to do what you know is right and begin again to serve god through your stewardship and i believe paul would say amen to that and he would say that's just the way it was in Philippi now i want you to notice thirdly the products of giving there's a very interesting thing that happens when we give and it's so beautifully illustrated in this text first of all when the philippians gave paul was blessed notice verse 18
[time=2375] but i have all and i abound and i am full i have received of a paphrodite as the things which were sent from you god sent to paul
[time=2386] the supply mentioned in verse 19 but he sent it by way of the philippians
[time=2392] god sent it to the philippians and the philippians brought it to paul it came by way of philippi to paul and he said i got it from you you were the channel through which god met this need and so the first thing that happened when the philippians gave was this paul's need was met and the thing that happens first and foremost when god's people give to any ministry is that the need of the ministry is met and that's good that's positive if the need is legitimate if the cause is right if the gospel is being preached if god's work is going forward in an ethical manner in honesty without deceit and god uses some of you to meet that need that's good but that's not the end that's only the first that's only the first thing that happens notice secondly that not only did paul get blessed but the philippians got blessed too verse 17 says paul said now it's not necessarily because i want a gift that's not the issue but the issue is that i desire fruit that may abound to your account now how in the world can the philippians get anything out of giving paul said when they gave
[time=2468] they got blessed too if you've been listening all this month to the stewardship testimonies of the lay people in this church that's what you've been hearing i gave and i got blessed i gave to god and i'm the one that got now the bible teaches us that there's certain kinds of fruit in the christian life and most of you know this already but let's just review it quickly first of all there's conduct fruit the bible says there's a kind of fruit unto holiness roman 6 22 secondly there's convert fruit
[time=2500] the people we went to christ according to the bible are our fruit roman's one 13 paul said i desire to have fruit among the roman's then there's character fruit now what in the world is that well that's the fruit of the spirit Galatians 5 22 the fruit of the spirit is love joy piece that's the character we developed that's called fruit but did you know there's contribution fruit what's right here paul said when you gave what happened was you had fruit applied to your account in heaven i never saw that before i didn't realize that that was on the same level as converts and conduct and character here's a whole new way to be fruitful as a christian by giving to the things of god and paul said when you do that you have some things deposited to your account fruit abounds to your account in heaven well now notice thirdly when the flippians gave
[time=2554] paul had his need met and he was blessed and the flippians were blessed and here's the best part of all god was blessed and that's what it says right here in this text verse 18 but i have all in a bound and i'm full having received of apaphrodite is the things which were sent from you an odor of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable well pleasing unto god
[time=2583] hardly a week goes by that someone doesn't ask me pastor is this pleasing to the lord i'm thinking about doing thus and thus is it pleasing to the lord for me to do that and you know there are some things they ask me that i don't know the answer to there are some folks that say that it doesn't please the lord when your hair gets down over your ears i've heard that well i obviously don't believe that or else i'm long overdue some folks say doesn't please the lord do you let hair grow on your face some folks can't do that but others have done it and if it's not pleasing to the lord that you have hair growing on your face we are in a backslidden condition as a church now you know those are all peripheral things and i don't have anything to say about that i don't believe god has expressed his will about those matters no matter how some folks wrench things out of context from the old testament and other things like that but i want to tell you something folks there are certain things in the word of god about which we can be absolutely certain that when we do them we please god and here's one of them
[time=2651] when you give to the lord's work the bible says that is acceptable and it is
[time=2658] well pleasing to god that means that when we take our offering here in this church sometimes it becomes a ritual and i wish it weren't like that when we take out of our pockets and we put into the offering plate the gift that we're giving to god that week that according to this text is a worship experience it says that it's like an incense burned upon the altar and the aroma ascends into the throne room of glory and the the incense permeates the nostrils of god and it's satisfying and pleasing to him and he likes it and it's good i don't have to be endowed about that that's not something i have to wonder about i wonder if this pleases god i know it pleases god he's honored and blessed by it turn in your bibles to the ninth chapter of second Corinthians few people today understand what a direct relationship giving is to god you say i don't give to god i give to the church i don't give to god i give to the bible power i don't give to god i give to the christian school well when you do that you give to god how do you do that notice second krentians chapter nine and i want you to notice four verses of scripture that show what happens when we give and we honor god with our giving first of all verse 11
[time=2745] and obviously you know that these two chapters eight and nine are stewardship chapters dealing with with giving verse 11 being enriched in everything unto all bountifulness which causes through us what is it thanksgiving to god
[time=2763] all right there's one verse 12 for the administration of this service not only supply at the want of the saints but it is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god notice verse 13 while by the proving of this ministration they glorify god notice verse 15 but thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift this is thanksgiving sunday you know what i've discovered a lot of folks forget the end of that word they like the thanks part it's the giving part they don't like there isn't anything i know of that says thank you to god is tangibly and is meaningfully is to say lord thank you for what you've done here's part of me is an expression of my of my gratitude and when we give you see we get involved with god and he's blessed and he's honored and the bible says it pleases him and it's just a joy for me to teach the doctrine of stewardship for this month because i know that some of you are going to hear it and you're going to do before god what you ought to do and the result is you'll start to please him there isn't anything i know that feels better than to please god the products of our giving and i want you to notice fourthly we have to touch on this lightly but we won't take too much time here the price of giving will you notice that he is talking
[time=2859] in this passage of scripture not about a convenience but a sacrifice he says it is a sacrifice well pleasing unto god
[time=2871] not a convenience not an opportunity not even a proportion a sacrifice now the bible teaches us that the new testament has kinds of sacrifices just like the old testament had what are they well you know them Romans 12 1 and 2 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a sacrifice turn in your bibles to hebrews chapter 13 hebrews chapter 13 and you will notice in verses 15 and 16 that there are three other new testament sacrifices that we offer to god hebrews 13 15 and 16
[time=2913] by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise there's the second one the first sacrifice for new testament christians is your body the second one is your praise the bible calls it the fruit of your lips and the third one in verse 16 is doing good good works and the fourth one is sharing or giving financial giving it's talking about now the bible says there are four sacrifices for the new testament christian my body belongs to him my praise belongs to him my good works belong to him as a sacrifice and my stewardship my giving is a sacrifice well pleasing unto god now men and women the part of that we don't like is that it's sacrifice he's not talking about what comes easy every time in the old testament that they had a sacrifice something had to die you can't have a sacrifice unless
[time=2970] something dies i'm talking about animal sacrifices the blood sacrifices they had to die what i find in my own life is that when i am called upon to sacrifice for god
[time=2986] in order to do that and really enter into what it means to sacrifice something has to die within me maybe it's a project that i'd planned maybe it's something i dreamed about doing something i'd hoped for for myself or for my family and god speaks to me about some need that has to be met and he wants me to be the channel to meet that need and for me to do that something has to die and i don't like it it's painful it hurts
[time=3016] and i'm afraid that in many of our lives we have not yet come to the threshold of what it means to be sacrificial in our giving but the price of stewardship in this passage is that it must cost us something john calvin in his day lamented that the heathens he knew contributed more to express the superstition to their un their unchristian gods and most of the
[time=3045] christian people did to express their faith in the living god there are many of you who hear my voice that spend more money to honor the god in your life whether it be pleasure or prestige or power you spend more money there than you do to honor the god who made you and saved you and brought you into his family there's no sacrifice in that
[time=3068] i always have laughed when i've read the words of saint Augustine who said in his day that he believed with all of his heart the reason the taxes had gone up is because people had stopped giving to god the way they should and god was going to take it from them one way or the other i haven't heard much of that in the political maneuvering during these last weeks but could that be a possible answer for higher taxes we have stopped giving to god if you've read recently the statistics of what american people give to anything that even smells like a charity you'd be embarrassed
[time=3102] we spend more money in our country on dog food and we give to the things of god
[time=3109] and we wonder why inflation is eating us up and why there's no money left when everything is taken out
[time=3120] well i need to get off the need part and let's talk about the provision that's the goodest thing we've got to say the provision of giving i think the 19th verse of flippians for is one of the greatest promises god has given to those who honor him with their substance and all i can do is go through the verse and give you two or three words that will help you never to forget it because it's god's promise to you first of all notice the source of god's provision my god paul said but my god shall supply
[time=3153] he's talking here to people who are involved in giving this is not a blank check for all people who are christians regardless of their stewardship this is a promise that goes along with those who are involved in giving to god he is talking here about those who are ministering through their income to paul's needs and paul is saying now god is going to meet your need because god has used you to meet my need certainly they had given sacrificially they must have been wondering but what is going to happen when i have a need and paul is saying here's the good news because god used you to meet my need my god is going to supply your need that's the source now notice the surety of it he doesn't say he might or he perhaps could he says my god shall supply your need it's certain that he will i sat with a young couple in my office this week who said we want to start tithing but pastor we've got some things out ahead of us this year that need to be done and i don't know if we're going to be able to do them if we began to tie then i had the joy of saying to them seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness all these things will be added unto you my god shall supply your need notice not only the source of it and the surety of it
[time=3228] notice the sufficiency of it but my god shall supply most of your needs the most important needs my god shall supply all of your needs you say well pastor there are some things i didn't get last year that i wanted oh you misunderstand he didn't say it's supply all your wants all of your needs a few things i wanted that i didn't get either but my needs have been supplied you remember how we talked about needs what you put on what you put in what you put up and what you put away all my needs have been supplied and then notice the standard of it but my god shall supply all your needs
[time=3274] according to his riches in glory in christ jesus the standard of it is the sufficiency of an almighty god in the 24th psalm
[time=3283] says he owns the world and everybody that's in it the cattle on a thousand hills the wealth in every mine all souls are him god owns it all and he has promised that if i'm involved with him as a steward
[time=3294] that he will supply all of my needs and the standard for that supply is his wealth and i just want to make this point in closing so you don't forget it
[time=3304] he has promised to supply our needs not out of his riches but according to them
[time=3310] if a millionaire says to me i'm going to supply your need out of my riches he could give me a buck say get lost but if he says he's going to supply my needs according to his riches he's got to do much more than that the standard of the supply has to be the amount of the source and that's what god has promised to do for all of us
[time=3335] who trust him with stewardship in our lives as we honor him with our substance he wants to do that for all of you he wants to do that for me and he'll do it today if we'll get involved in believing him and his word let's pray together shall we
