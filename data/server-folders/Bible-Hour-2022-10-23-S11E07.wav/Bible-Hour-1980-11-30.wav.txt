[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=21] [MUSIC]
[time=49] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=51] That's a good singing to begin our service.
[time=57] And we always like to begin by acknowledging the greatness of our God.
[time=60] It is God in Heaven, His Son, the Lord Jesus to whom all of our worship is directed during
[time=67] this time and He is a great God, worthy of our praise and adoration.
[time=74] We welcome all of you who have joined us now by television and we trust that this hour will be one of blessing in your life to bring encouragement into each and every one of your homes and into your hearts.
[time=84] We begin our worship today with the ministry of our choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they sing this hymn of worship.
[time=93] O for a thousand tongues to sing, I pray for Jesus' praise, the glory of my God and He,
[time=111] the triumphs of His grace.
[time=115] I gracious master and take the voice just me to the full day, to spread through all the
[time=129] prayer of His house I name.
[time=144] Jesus the King and church our feet and His eyes all rose His.
[time=153] He prays the power of His blessing, His hands of Christmas free, His quiet name of the Father's
[time=168] name of the Father's name of the Father's name of the Father's name of the Father's
[time=212] I'm sure many of you have had occasion in the past to watch the old time gospel hour.
[time=220] One of the television programs that has been proclaiming the gospel probably longer than
[time=226] most of the rest that are on the air now, Dr. Jerry Falwell has been on television for many years.
[time=232] And we get it here very early in the morning, sometimes those of us who are involved in the ministry are already gone when it comes on and we have to catch it later on by cable or whatever, but we're grateful to God for what He has done in the life of that church and its ministry across the nation.
[time=249] We have many friends there.
[time=250] I have had the privilege of speaking there on occasion.
[time=252] Dr. Falwell is going to be here in June of this year in our church.
[time=256] We're grateful to the Lord for the privilege of having with us today one of the groups that sings on the old time gospel hour, the Pantana family.
[time=264] They've made a couple of changes since they were here the last time.
[time=267] They now have a new couple singing with them.
[time=269] Mr. and Mrs. John Myers and I heard just before the service that the Myers grandmother watches
[time=276] the Bible hour every week in Cridersville, Ohio, Mrs. Paxton.
[time=281] And I know that this service with her grandson singing will be of special interest to her and we'd like to just take a moment and express our joy for the privilege of having her grandson and trust that their music will be a special blessing as John said to Granny and we hope it will be that.
[time=299] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=456] I'm so very glad that you've joined us today.
[time=459] I know you have appreciated already the music of the Pantana family.
[time=462] We'll be hearing more from them in a few moments.
[time=464] But right now I want you to join with me and my wife Donna as we talk together about the matters that pertain to television and to especially our very unique audience of worshipers who share with us in their own homes.
[time=479] Just recently I had the opportunity to sit down and write to many of you who are part of the Bible, our ministry, a very special Thanksgiving letter about a project which is very heavy upon my heart.
[time=489] One of our missionaries Dan Smith serves God in the region of the Amazon River in Peru and ministers in a houseboat ministry along that river ministering to the villages that he is able to reach through water transportation.
[time=506] Recently when talking to Dan he shared with me a tremendous need to be able to put Spanish Bibles in the hands of many of these natives who he is touching and we've taken that on as a special Thanksgiving project. Most of you have already received word about it and many of you have responded already.
[time=521] We thank you for your interest in missions and the opportunity to help us help them. I just want to take a moment and encourage you if you haven't already written to us and responded I hope you will do it this week.
[time=532] We'd like to hear from you because we want to accomplish our goal in sending these Bibles to to the Amazon region and help the people there who we support through our missionary budget here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Donna you have something else that you've been wanting to share with our friends relative to a special present that we'd like to send to all of our Bible hour viewers.
[time=555] A very special present because at this time of the year well it meets a special need. Yes it certainly does and it has always been our objective from the very beginning of the Bible hour to place in your hands things that are going to be helpful things that are relevant to the Word of God and to things that can make a difference in your life. And a book that we have just produced is called Psalms Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely from God's Word and it is just a collection of Scripture verses that give you promises and prescriptions to help you or perhaps a friend who is going through a period of loneliness in their lives.
[time=593] For instance under prescriptions they give you Psalm 118 24.
[time=599] This is the day which the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=604] And that really doesn't give us an option if we're down or if we're really feeling bad the Lord says that this is the day that he's made and we still are to rejoice in it. And we would be happy to send you a free copy of this little booklet. All you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000. Request the book Psalms Promises
[time=627] and Prescriptions and we'll be happy to send you one. And if you would perhaps like to have an extra copy for someone that you know who is lonely at this time of the year during the holidays we'd be more than happy to send you an extra copy. Donna this week in our newspaper I read a very interesting article on the problem of depression during the holiday seasons written by a number of people in the professional areas of counseling and psychology. They pointed out that one of the problems during the season is the problem of unrealized expectations in the hearts of many individuals. It's a family time and if families are broken there's an awful hurt that's there. And we just want you to know that God loves you and he has a plan for your life and no matter what your circumstance might be his word has an answer and an encouragement to you.
[time=675] And that's why we've produced this booklet of Psalms Promises and Prescriptions to help you during this time to be an encouragement to your life.
[time=684] We do not want you to send a special amount of money for this book if you want to enclose a gift to help in the Bible our ministry that's fine but there's no cost for it and we'd like to send it to you free and postage paid if you'll just write or call us this week. And we hope you will do that because we know that this booklet can be of an encouraging help in your life and maybe even through you to help other people as well.
[time=707] Donna once again why don't you give them the information so they'll know how to get in touch with us as we encourage them to write us this week.
[time=714] Okay you may call us at our toll-free number that's 1-800-453-9000
[time=720] and that number is available at any time during the week not during this just during this hour or you may write to us if you prefer and the mailing address is pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Once again it's post office box
[time=738] 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. Donna as we go back to our service I want everyone to be encouraged to open their Bibles to the book of Jeremiah the ninth chapter two very special verses that will be of great encouragement to you as you set your priorities not only for the remaining days of this year but for the new year as well.
[time=758] I know God we use it in your life as you follow along in our study today.
[time=768] [MUSIC]
[time=774] Jesus my Lord I will love them Jesus my Lord I will care
[time=796] for you've gone to the limit for my salvation
[time=811] you only you I adore
[time=822] Jesus all Jesus all his pain was for
[time=850] my game Jesus
[time=856] Jesus my Lord was despised by men they sentenced him
[time=878] to die then crucified him he spoke these words
[time=892] as the light grew dear he said forgive them
[time=903] for they know not what they do
[time=912] Jesus Jesus
[time=942] Jesus
[time=985] we're going to ask the Pantanas to do two more songs before the message and maybe in between them Phil you could just take a minute very quickly and introduce all of the people in the group and we didn't tell them they were going to do this so they'll just ad lib and I'm sure they'll do fine I have been in Lynchburg and I know how they do it there and this is calm compared to the way things are down there this is organized and ready they just do what comes naturally down there and it all works out somehow I don't know how they pull that off but so just this warning you're on for two instead of one god bless you sing
[time=1032] Jesus is all the world to be my life my joy my own
[time=1050] he is my strength from day to day without him I
[time=1063] would I am sad to give I go
[time=1078] other one can cheer me when I am sad he makes me glad
[time=1095] he's my friend Jesus is all the world to me I want no better friend
[time=1122] I trust him now I'll trust him when life's bleeding days shall
[time=1136] lay beautiful life with such a friend beautiful life that has no
[time=1156] He turned alive he turned alive he's my
[time=1184] friend
[time=1195] true delight for us to be here and share on the services this morning we've
[time=1205] looked forward to coming I told the folks in the earlier hour that I began singing back in 1962 near Lima Ohio with my two brothers John and David I and one
[time=1216] night we went to a concert you heard a young man sing by the name of Johnny Meyers and he's with us this morning and we asked him to join us and we sang that way as a quartet for several years and we went to a department store and bought four of the ugliest turquoise suits you've ever seen in your life in fact they were iridescent and if you turn one way they were green if you
[time=1238] turned the other way they were gold and most folks thought we had two suits and so we started
[time=1244] out in high school singing together and John is now an Air Force recruiter at Kokomo Indiana
[time=1250] and he and his wife Bev who is with us also and their two children are going to move down to Lynchburg and come to Liberty Baptist College next semester and we'll be joining together singing the gospel and song we're not here to entertain you or impress you but to express what the Lord Jesus Christ has done in our hearts and lives for he hath put a new song on our mouth even praise unto her God and many shall see it and shall fear and shall trust in him my wife Joy and I have been here this is a third time and my parents have been
[time=1278] here as well before and it seems like every time my wife and I are here she's expecting a child and we're expecting our third one next February the 20th we have two boys and we're looking forward to the third one and between now and then Joy will be looking swell
[time=1294] so we're thanking Lord for that here's a beautiful song that we trust will be a blessing to you during this Thanksgiving season we have much to be thankful for but yet there are
[time=1305] some folks who perhaps are going through some trials and tribulations but to the Christian we can know that we have a heavenly Father who loves us and cares for us and knows everything about us even the very hairs of our header numbered the sparrow does not fall to the ground without the heavenly Father knowing about it how much more does he care for each of us and here's a song we can learn a lesson from as we consider the lilies
[time=1352] and there's not a king with more splendor than they consider the sparrows they don't
[time=1370] fret nor soul but they're fed by the master watch as they grow we have a heavenly Father
[time=1395] with eyes full of mercy and the heart full of love we really can't sweat your head is
[time=1415] alone consider the lilies and then you will know may I introduce you to this friend of
[time=1442] the Lord. And he's not too busy to care about you. And he's not too busy to care about you.
[time=1470] We have a heavenly Father above with eyes full of mercy and the heart full of love.
[time=1494] He really cares when your head is below. And see the lilies and then you will know.
[time=1546] I want you to open your Bibles with me today to the ninth chapter of Jeremiah the prophet
[time=1562] from the Old Testament Jeremiah's writings in the Old Testament Jeremiah chapter 9 and
[time=1569] we want to read together verses 23 and 24. Jeremiah 9, 23 and 24. How many of you have
[time=1578] a Bible with you today? Let me see them hold them up. One of the great sites in any church is folks who come prepared with the word and if you have one and someone next to you doesn't have share it with them so that we can read aloud together Jeremiah chapter 9 verses 23
[time=1594] and 24 everyone reading together out loud. Thus say of the Lord let not the wise man glory in his
[time=1603] wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches
[time=1611] but let him that glory is glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that I am the
[time=1619] Lord who exercises loving kindness justice and righteousness in the earth for in these
[time=1626] things I delight say of the Lord shall we pray together oh God in heaven our hearts and our heads
[time=1637] are bowed before the we're willing to hear your truth today we ask that we will be receptive to
[time=1648] what you will teach us by your Holy Spirit through the word of God Lord many of us have
[time=1656] come into the service today with our defenses already up the barrier already constructed to
[time=1662] keep God at an arm's length from us and I pray today that those barriers will be broken down and
[time=1669] there will be a closeness that we sense in this hour as we study the word of God together oh God
[time=1676] we thank you that thou art present with us in the person of thy spiritual and in the person of the
[time=1683] Lord Jesus Christ present with us here in this hour in this service and we pray that we will be
[time=1689] sensitive to your presence as you speak to us from your word in Jesus name I pray amen we have
[time=1698] just finished a month long emphasis in our church on the subject of stewardship we have talked about
[time=1707] the importance of our priorities of making sure that we do what is right with our time and our
[time=1714] treasure and our talent today in this message I want to talk about the subject of the ultimate
[time=1723] priority of life our time our talent and our treasure will be related to what is most important to us
[time=1731] and without a message of understanding about the purpose of life in this world all of these other
[time=1740] things could be extraneous discussions and studies out around the periphery with nothing to tie them
[time=1746] together and make them meaningful in our own experience so today I want to talk to you about
[time=1752] God's priority for your life and for mine in the two verses that we have read we find an equal division
[time=1763] one verse dealing with the alternatives and the other verse dealing with the absolute verse 23 talks about the alternatives that we have before us in our lifetime the alternatives to a number one
[time=1774] priority the second verse verse 24 deals with God's estimation of the most important thing in living
[time=1783] we cannot understand the second until we work our way first of all through the first there are
[time=1790] three alternatives that Jeremiah speaks of in this chapter and I would imagine that if we were to
[time=1796] take everyone present and all those listening to this message today and divide their priorities up we could categorize them and organize them under the three alternatives that are listed in verse 23
[time=1809] for Jeremiah says to us let not the wise man glory in his wisdom let not the mighty man glory in his
[time=1816] might let not the rich man glory in his riches and in those three statements we have probably
[time=1824] the three driving motivations that that fuel the lives of people in our world today we have the
[time=1833] intellect and wisdom we have might or strength or power and we have wealth and we are reading
[time=1842] from the word of God today that it is all right to have those things as long as they don't become the focal point of our lives he does not say in this text let no man be wise let no man be mighty
[time=1854] let no man be wealthy he says don't glory in those things as if they were the only thing
[time=1861] in life don't make a god out of them don't bow down before them don't let those things be the
[time=1867] central focal point of your living now let's examine them one at a time first of all alternative
[time=1874] number one to God's plan is this a wise man glorying in his wisdom this phrase deals with the god of
[time=1885] intellectualism the the throne being the seed of learning in the great institutions of our world
[time=1893] and god says it is not white it is not wise for a wise man to glory in his much learning
[time=1902] i have just recently come from a very well-known seminary where i spent two weeks of my life
[time=1909] a great seminary that's training young men for the ministry all over the country
[time=1915] it is the seminary which i attended and i thank god for it while i was there one of the seminary professors shared with me that one of the great problems they have in the seminary life is to keep
[time=1926] the young men who come there with a desire to serve god from getting sidetracked on an intellectual
[time=1933] pursuit so that they become mere mechanical technicians of the Hebrew and Greek language and
[time=1939] of theology per se and they come to the place where they build up all of this knowledge and this
[time=1945] understanding about the disciplines that are available on the campus and wisdom becomes their god and they forget about the god of wisdom i know the temptation the discipline and the pressure
[time=1957] and the time that's needed to to master the studies and i realize what a great temptation that was for me while i was there and god says to us that it is wrong for us to make wisdom our god
[time=1970] in our evangelism training program here on occasion i have shared with our students
[time=1976] a very interesting experience i had on an occasion passed to hear dr jadwin ore
[time=1984] one i believe one of the great apologists of our generation dr ore told in his message that day of having served in the army chaplaincy and on an occasion
[time=1997] two young men walked into his office to talk with him about spiritual things and when he opened the conversation one of the young men said to him what dr ore you don't understand we are atheists
[time=2008] and never to be defeated by a moment's comment dr ore said to him well let me ask you a question
[time=2018] young men let me ask you this and you be as honest as you can as you evaluate your own lives and as you review what you have done in a massing knowledge and and you're growing up in this in this universe how much of the total knowledge both actual and potential would you say that you possess and the young men questioned him and said what do you mean he said what i mean is in all of the facts that are available in all of the possible knowledge in this vast universe how much of it do you suppose you possess in your own mind and they looked at each other rather sheepishly in one of them said well i suppose not even one tenth of one percent dr ore looked at them and made this point he said do you suppose
[time=2061] young men that god could possibly exist in the ninety nine and nine tenths of potential knowledge
[time=2069] that you do not know you see an atheist when he says he does not believe there is a god
[time=2077] puts himself in a place of great pride and arrogance he he says there is no god and to say that he
[time=2084] must assume that he has total knowledge and no man has that and so after talking for a few moments
[time=2091] the one young man said to the other well i guess maybe we use the wrong term we're not atheists we're
[time=2097] agnostics doctor or said well let me ask you this question what kind of an agnostic are you
[time=2107] are you an ordinary agnostic or are you an ornery agnostic well what's the difference they said well
[time=2115] he said an ordinary agnostic says you cannot know if there is a god you see the word agnostic is
[time=2121] a word which means not to know it is the word gnosis knowledge and the alpha privative which negates the word meaning not to know said are you an ordinary agnostic that means you say
[time=2133] i don't know or are you an ornery agnostic an ornery agnostic says i don't know you don't know nobody
[time=2140] knows you can't know well they talked among themselves for a few moments and then one of
[time=2147] the men said but dr ore how do you explain all of the the brilliant scientists all of the men of
[time=2154] great learning and philosophy all of the brilliant agnostics that this world has produced how do you explain that dr ore said young man how much do you know about homiletics he said well i don't even
[time=2169] know what it is homiletics is the study of preaching he turned to the other young man he said how
[time=2177] much do you know about homiletics he said i don't know what it is either dr ore said which of you young men would you say is the most brilliant at not knowing anything about homiletics and he went on to make this point that a man may be a brilliant scientist he may be a brilliant
[time=2196] philosopher he may be a brilliant doctor and he may know all there is to know about those disciplines but he can be an absolute fool when it comes to the things of god and if he is he is no longer
[time=2207] qualified to be called a brilliant agnostic because you can't be brilliant at not knowing something
[time=2213] that's why Jeremiah says let not the wise man glory in his wisdom you know what god's estimation
[time=2224] of the world's wisdom is first Corinthians chapter three verse 19 says the wisdom of this world is
[time=2230] foolishness with god what that means men and women is that the the wisest man who has ever been born
[time=2239] who has no relationship with god does not have the common sense of the most ignorant person in
[time=2249] the slums of the city who has come to know christ as his savior that person from down there with no
[time=2255] training and no understanding whatsoever of how the world works or why it works or anything if that
[time=2261] person knows god personally through his son Jesus Christ that man has a wisdom that the most wise
[time=2268] worldly wise man will never know and that's why it's so foolish for any people whether they be
[time=2274] Christian or non-Christian to bow down at the altar of learning and make that the central focal point of their life let not the wise man glory in his wisdom what does it mean to glory let me be
[time=2288] clear for I am not advocating ignorance I believe god expects us to use our intellect
[time=2297] its fullest ability and to study and be equipped but to glory in something is to be absorbed in
[time=2305] its pursuit so as to make a god of it in your life so as to regard it as the ultimate good
[time=2313] so as to regard it as as the source of your present happiness and your eternal destiny
[time=2319] and god says don't you dare glory in wisdom in that realm now the second alternative is like unto
[time=2328] the first let not the mighty man glory in his might we're not necessarily talking here with
[time=2335] the use of this word of brute strength let not the atlas glory in his physique that's not what he
[time=2341] saying he's talking here about power about prestige about influence and he is saying let not the man
[time=2348] who has gained unto himself power and prestige and influence look at that as the ultimate in life
[time=2354] and say I have arrived for there is no guarantee that your influence in this world will allow you
[time=2367] any in the next some folks feel it life is made up of climbing the ladder getting to the top they
[time=2377] picture life as a triangle down here you're among the hoi puloi and you gradually move up and the ranks thick thin until you get to the top and you're all alone you've made it you know what god does
[time=2388] to that he takes it and he turns it right upside down he says that's not the way it works let him who will be the greatest among you be least and he turns it upside down and he says the leader in the Christian realm is the one not who is served by the most people but serves the most people and he destroys the fabric
[time=2409] of society as we see it through the eyes of our culture let not the mighty man glory in his might thirdly let not the wealthy man glory in his wealth now once again through the whole month we've
[time=2420] been talking about the fact that it isn't wrong to be wealthy either is not anything wrong some of
[time=2426] the greatest men in the bible were wealthy men god used them and blessed them and they influenced their world wealth is not wrong but when wealth becomes the god of our life that is wrong and
[time=2439] that's why Jeremiah says let not the wealthy man glory in his wealth there's an oft repeated story of a group of very influential people who met
[time=2452] around a table in the edgewater beach hotel in chicago in 1923 they included the president of the united states steel company the president of the largest utility
[time=2463] company the greatest wheat speculator the president of the new york stock exchange member of the president's cabinet the greatest speculator on wall street the president of the bank of international settlements and the head of the world's greatest monopoly all of them gathered together in that place magazines for years carried their success stories how they had achieved how they
[time=2484] amassed wealth how they were influential and powerful in their world but a roll call of these men a quarter of a century later gives to us the true value of what
[time=2494] they had committed their lives to the president of us steel was Charles Schwab he lived on borrowed
[time=2500] money the last five years of his life and he died broke the president of the largest utility
[time=2506] company samuel instill died a penniless fugitive from justice in a foreign country president of the new york stock exchange richard whitney served time in sing sing prison
[time=2518] the member of the president's cabinet was albert fall he was pardoned from prison so that he could die at home the greatest speculator on wall street jesse livermore committed suicide
[time=2530] the president of the bank of international settlements leon frasier committed suicide
[time=2536] the head of the world's largest monopoly iver crueger committed suicide
[time=2542] all of these men having risen to the top of the world of wealth and riches
[time=2548] found out in the midst of it all that it did not satisfy and ended their lives in misery and agony and emptiness
[time=2559] that is why jeremyel warns us in this verse of scripture as we deal with the alternatives let
[time=2567] not the wealthy man glory in his wealth for you see if he makes it is god he will discover that when
[time=2573] he needs is god the most it will fail him
[time=2581] i'm sure you can see that as you take these three circles of wealth and power
[time=2587] and influence and you put them together you can drop most of today's people in one of those circles
[time=2598] because that's what they live for and men and women far too many christians find themselves
[time=2604] in one of those three circles and they don't understand the division in their soul
[time=2610] they don't understand the problems of integration that they have trying to make their life work
[time=2616] the problem is they're giving lip service to having given their hearts and their lives to god but they're running around in the orbits of these three circles and they can't make any sense out of life i want you to notice that the absolute begins with a word in verse 24 that contrasts it to all
[time=2633] that is gone before but let him that glory of glory in this it is as if jeremyel said here are
[time=2642] all of the things some folks can give their lives to but i want to say to you you leave that behind
[time=2648] and here's what you give your life to but let him that glory of glory in this that he knoweth
[time=2656] and he understandeth me someone has said as you read these two verses man's glory is restrained
[time=2663] until it gets to the capital me in verse 24 but let him that glory of glory in this that he
[time=2670] understandeth and knoweth me paul said in the new testament god forbid that i should glory
[time=2679] save in the cross and in his writings to the carrinthians twice he reminded the carrinthian
[time=2685] believers in that sorted six city where they functioned and where they lived he said to them
[time=2691] as it is written let him that gloryeth glory in the lord first carrinthians 131 and second carrinthians
[time=2698] 1017 but he that gloryeth let him glory in the lord say listen when you get together with your christian friends what do you glory in the word glory could be translated in some places as to
[time=2710] brag what do you brag about most of the christian fellowship i've been a part of recently we don't
[time=2717] brag too much about what we've come to know about the lord and how we understand him better than
[time=2723] we used to you see we get off in those circles just like the world we brag about our new possessions our new car our new position our new degree the bible says we're to understand and to know god
[time=2739] and make that the pursuit of our life now in both the old and the new testament men and women there
[time=2747] are illustrations of how we gradually come to the place of personal intimacy with god
[time=2753] in the old testament story of moses as he went to mount sinai to bring back the law of god we have
[time=2761] there pictured for us perfectly four concentric circles of approachability to the god of heaven
[time=2767] i want us to study those this morning very briefly so that we can find out in our own lives where
[time=2773] we are in the process of knowing god if you have your bibles with you you might want to turn to the
[time=2781] book of exodus and the 19th chapter exodus chapter 19 and in verses 11 and 12 we get the instruction
[time=2791] that god gave to the people of israel as moses was about to go to the mountain we read and be ready
[time=2797] on the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people amount upon mount sinai and thou shall set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to
[time=2807] yourselves that she go not up into the mount to touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the
[time=2813] mount shall be surely put to death the mountain represented god that's where he would be and god said to the people of israel you can come near it you can get next to the bottom of it
[time=2825] you can approach it but you cannot ascend it you can be in the outer ring and we learn later
[time=2832] that the actions of these people demonstrated they didn't want to know god anyway they wanted their own way their own lifestyle their own thing and god said to those people who were in but not
[time=2842] of here's where you are you're in the outer ring notice the second circle exodus 24 verses 9 through 11
[time=2853] there we read these words then went up moses and erin nadab in a bayou and 70 of the elders of israel
[time=2860] and they saw the god of israel and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire
[time=2866] stone and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand and they saw god and did he didn't drink now the circle is getting
[time=2876] tighter out of that great group who were not allowed to but approach the mountain there are now 70 plus nadab in a bayou and they're allowed to come closer and go with moses part of the way on his
[time=2887] journey to the top it's a closer circle a smaller group more intimate than the first but as we study
[time=2893] in the scripture we discover that this smaller group this second circle of intimacy they got
[time=2899] closer to god and they saw god but it did not transform their lives for just a few verses later
[time=2905] they're worshiping the golden calf denying everything they supposedly would have seen by that intimate approach to god and then we see the third circle in the same chapter verses 13 and 14
[time=2916] and moses rose up and his servant joshua and moses went up into the mount of god and he said
[time=2924] unto the elders terry ye here for us until we come again unto you and behold erin and erar with you
[time=2930] if any man have any matters to do let him come unto them now the great circle that was allowed to approach the mountain has been narrowed down to the 70 plus a few and the 70 plus a few has been
[time=2941] narrowed down to one man joshua and joshua and moses approached the mountain say why was joshua
[time=2947] allowed to be a part of that intimate group we had time this morning i'd take you to the 33rd
[time=2953] chapter of exodus verses 10 and 11 and show you that the reason joshua was allowed to approach
[time=2959] with moses was because when it was time to worship joshua stayed in the tabernacle to be close to
[time=2965] god he had a desire for god and then we see the most inner circle in verses 15 through 17th of
[time=2974] the 24th chapter and we read that moses went up into the mount in a cloud covered the mount and the glory of the lord about upon mount sine eye and the cloud covered it six days
[time=2985] and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of israel and moses went into the midst of the cloud and got up into the mount and moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights say how do you explain that here's a whole group of people not allowed
[time=3005] to come near the mountain here's 70 allowed a little further here's one who can come part of the way
[time=3012] and here's one who goes to the top and the scripture says about moses and other passages of scripture that he spoke with god face to face as a friend speaketh with a friend one passage in number says
[time=3024] he spoke with god mouth to mouth intimately personally in fellowship
[time=3030] and in Exodus 33 we're told that because he was intimate with god moses was allowed to know god's
[time=3041] ways may I submit to you today that all of us fall into one of those circles some of us are in the
[time=3047] outer circle we like to watch god we like to view him we like to see what he's doing as long as we
[time=3053] don't have to get involved ourselves we'll stay on the outside and watch what happens my isn't it wonderful what god is doing today and then some of us we like to be a little closer we'll get in
[time=3063] that group of 70 we'll be involved a little bit in serving god in some intimate more intimate than
[time=3069] the rest maybe we'll be church members maybe we'll be servants maybe we'll get involved here and then there are two or three four five maybe a dozen or so whose heart beats after the heart of
[time=3080] god and they say whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do it and they have fellowship intimate
[time=3089] fellowship you know the same illustration is true in the new testament there were 70 disciples who went two by two and then the lord chose 12 and out of the 12 he picked three peter james and john
[time=3100] and he allowed peter james and john the intimate experience of watching some of the most exciting
[time=3106] things that ever happened in the life of the lord we're told in the new testament that those three
[time=3112] were present when he raised jiwitt gyrus daughter they were present on the mount of transfiguration the mount of olives and in the garden of guessemane and yet even out of those
[time=3124] three the lord chose one who would be intimate in a very special way it was the apostle john
[time=3130] when the cross is erected in the saviour has strung out upon the wood you look around for those
[time=3138] who were his disciples and you will find but one standing beneath the cross it is the apostle john
[time=3147] to whom the lord committed his own mother and we ask ourselves the question what excluded
[time=3155] the rest of the disciples why weren't they allowed in that most intimate relationship with their
[time=3161] saviour the lord why did they not know him personally as jeremiah instructs us to know him well some may
[time=3167] say because of perfection they weren't perfect but if you look at that inner group that secret three
[time=3174] who were chosen out of the disciples to be closest to the saviour you would see peter the denier
[time=3180] and james and john whom the scripture calls the sons of thunder the fire eaters the tempered
[time=3189] they were the three couldn't be perfection some may say well it was temperament that's what it was
[time=3196] that's what caused them to be close to the lord they were like him they they related to him because of their personality well surely the volatile peter
[time=3207] who denied him three times doesn't fit in that group there's nothing to suggest that the lord was
[time=3214] like that wasn't their temperament what was it that caused in the relationship with the lord that the
[time=3221] apostle john was the only one left when all had forsaken him and fled men and women i submit to you
[time=3227] it was his desire to know god it was john about whom the scripture says he lean hard
[time=3234] upon the breast of jesus at the supper so that he could gain every intimate word that would fall from the lips of his master it was john who even though older than the rest of the disciples ran
[time=3246] to the tomb first and beat out the younger in the foot race so that he could come to see what had become of his lord he loved the lord jesus more than the rest and because he loved god with all
[time=3259] of his heart he sought out opportunities to be with him and to know him and to build that relationship so that it was special it was desire i am more committed than ever before men and women that the
[time=3273] one thing that separates christians in their christianity is the deep hunger to know god
[time=3280] and to serve him with all their hearts sometimes we equate physical and spiritual hunger
[time=3287] together but it's not quite the same you see when we're physically hungry and we eat a meal we're
[time=3293] satisfied when we're spiritually hungry and we come to a feast and we eat a meal we get hungrier
[time=3299] did you ever notice that when you study the word of god and you get something really good from god it doesn't satisfy you it creates a new hunger that you can't quite satisfy you go and hear someone open the word of god and preach the word and it doesn't satisfy you many times when people come out of the services in the morning they'll say to me pastor i'm so excited to go home and find out more about that passage that's what it's supposed to do but folks the opposite of that is true as
[time=3323] well physical hunger works this way if we miss a meal we become ravenously hungry
[time=3329] to to get full to eat but spiritually if we miss a meal pretty soon we discover that our appetite
[time=3337] begins to wane did you notice that miss a day pretty soon it's easy to miss too don't come to
[time=3345] church on a sunday someone said to me well just just become easy to stay home if you don't feed your
[time=3352] appetite it dies and that's why a lot of folks don't know they're god
[time=3359] because you see they haven't allowed his truth to feed their life and as it feeds their life
[time=3372] create more and more hunger and thirst after god so that as the psalmist they could say
[time=3379] as the heart panneth after the water brook so panneth my heart after god thirsty for him
[time=3388] are you thirsty for him do you want to know him that's the ingredient that must be there if you're to know him and that can start today right now this very hour whoever you may be wherever you may be
