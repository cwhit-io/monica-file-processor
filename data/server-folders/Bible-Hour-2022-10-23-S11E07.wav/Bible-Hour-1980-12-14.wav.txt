[time=12] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerimon.
[time=21] [MUSIC]
[time=38] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=40] >> And we welcome you to this service.
[time=46] I am certain that you can tell by the difference in the setting of the service that we are celebrating the Lord's birth.
[time=54] This is one of the Christmas services of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and for all of you who have joined us by way of television, we are going to give you during this hour not only the message of Christmas from the written word, but the music of Christmas from our choir and from our musicians.
[time=71] We're in the middle of the living Christmas tree concerts here, 12 different concerts where we present the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this very unique way.
[time=81] Over 18,000 tickets have been distributed throughout this area and every night it seems like between now and Christmas, we're singing about Jesus Christ and we're rejoicing in the opportunity to declare Him as the Savior of the world to men and women far and wide.
[time=96] I know you will appreciate this opportunity to share in just a brief section of the living Christmas tree concert as our choir ministers to us now from the living Christmas tree, first of all, singing for us a very worship for Him called the Adoration.
[time=113] The soloist is Lena Peterson and following that the theme of this year's Christmas musical, The First Christmas.
[time=122] I know you will enjoy this music and we dedicated all to the honor and glory of our Savior who was born in Bethlehem and whom we worship.
[time=136] [MUSIC]
[time=166] >> Jesus Christ the wise man, Jesus we adore you.
[time=176] Just like the wise man, we come before you.
[time=186] This is our offering, our life to you we bring.
[time=196] Praise us we truly sing, also love the divine.
[time=206] Just like the wise man, Jesus we would love you.
[time=216] There is no other honor above you, give me our honored guest,
[time=231] your name be ever blessed, he must be manifest, oh son of God divine.
[time=249] Just like the wise man, Jesus we would praise you, with hearts and voices,
[time=265] we would love praise you.
[time=269] At this Christmas time now in our hearts of mine, come be our friend and I,
[time=285] oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God.
[time=299] Come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine.
[time=315] Come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I,
[time=335] oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God,
[time=344] come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I,
[time=360] oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine.
[time=389] come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I,

[time=461] oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine,
[time=468] come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I,
[time=530] oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, oh son of God divine, come be our friend and I, (applause)
[time=551] And I have been listening to that every night, sometimes twice a night, and I keep coming back for more.
[time=556] And someone reminded me last night, we have eight more to go.
[time=559] And I'm looking forward to every one of them because the music just stirs my soul and excites me
[time=565] because of the message that's contained and the beautiful way in which our choir presents it all.
[time=571] We're grateful to God for this opportunity He's given us at this season of the year to put Christ first and let others know that that's where He belongs.
[time=579] One of the classical songs that is so much a part of the Advent season is the great masterpiece
[time=588] which is a part of Handel's Messiah known as the Hallelujah Chorus.
[time=592] And I ask the choir if they would do that in this service because I think it's such a fitting way
[time=598] to worship the Lord at this time of the year.
[time=601] And I'm going to ask that those of you here in the auditorium in the sanctuary stand with me in honor and tribute to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords Jesus Christ as the choir sings the Hallelujah Chorus.
[time=615] [MUSIC]
[time=623] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[time=836] [MUSIC]
[time=851] We're glad you've joined us for this very special program and as you can obviously tell it's a Christmas program.
[time=857] Don and I are standing here underneath the giant Christmas tree right at the base of it where every night for
[time=864] it seems like three weeks we're singing in the Christmas tree and sharing with the people of the community what's going on in the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church is we try to tell the story of Christmas
[time=875] Donna we've finished four concerts and someone said last night we have eight to go.
[time=880] That's right but they're going fast.
[time=883] Yeah and folks seem to really be enjoying them and I think that's the exciting thing.
[time=887] People come here during the Christmas season and hear the real message of Christmas and they go away thrilled because they've heard again the old old story of Jesus Christ.
[time=897] I think it's exciting to have a part in putting Christ back into Christmas because so many of the things we do to celebrate Christmas which are enjoyable and part of the tradition
[time=906] and yet many times we leave Christ out and this really puts him in the place where he should be.
[time=911] Donna during the Christmas season I think my heart is warm toward our Founders Club members perhaps more than any other time of the year because we have opportunity even for these two very special telecast this week and next to share the Christmas message with our friends at home.
[time=927] I realize that if it were not for the Founders Club people we couldn't do that and they have helped us again as our partners through this past year to preach the gospel not only here in Fort Wayne but in the other areas where we are now being heard and seen.
[time=940] I just want to take a special moment of this telecast to thank our Founders Club members who support us regularly each month by prayer and with financial support.
[time=951] I also want to tell you that in just a few days you'll be receiving a very special Christmas greeting from us and I hope that it will be a blessing to you and a reminder to pray for us and for our family.
[time=962] We also have a little booklet that we've been offering for several weeks it's called Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely and it is a collection of Scripture verses which help people through especially this time of year when many are lonely and without friends and loved ones nearby.
[time=981] And there are Scriptures dealing with how to handle your loneliness when under prescriptions for the lonely is Joshua 1 9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest.
[time=1003] We would like to send you a copy of this little booklet all you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1 800 4539000.
[time=1013] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would like the booklet Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely and we'll be happy to send you one.
[time=1023] Donna I have talked to several people this past week who've shared with me how difficult it is for them at this time of the year when they see other families together enjoying the Christmas season and maybe they've lost a loved one or they've separated from divorce.
[time=1039] And it just is a big hurt that's very difficult to deal with and we're not trying to tell you that we have a panacea to that but we do know that God's word has something to say to you a word of encouragement a word of hope a word of help.
[time=1052] And we have put as much of this together and condensed it into this very little book so that it could be available to you and we think especially at this time of the year it can be a real help and encouragement.
[time=1064] So I do encourage you to write and ask for your copy of Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely and of course Donna's already mentioned you can call at 1 800 4539000 and we'll be happy to send that book to you free and postage paid as soon as we get your request.
[time=1082] I'd also like to remind our friends here in the Fort Wayne area who have an interest in what is happening here in the Black Hawk Baptist Church and especially the living Christmas tree.
[time=1091] Last night in the Saturday evening paper there was a very special article about the living Christmas tree that I think you'll find very interesting.
[time=1098] It goes into detail to describe how God has used this in communicating the message of his son to many hundreds of people in this area.
[time=1107] We also appreciate your prayers during these hectic days as we continue to tell the story of Jesus Christ come into a world of sin to be the savior of that world.
[time=1117] We have some more music that I know you'll enjoy and I hope you'll stay with us as we go back to our special Christmas service here in the sanctuary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1137] [MUSIC]
[time=1147] Silent night only night, all is calm, all is bright.
[time=1165] Bright, brown, young, virgin, mother and child.
[time=1178] Holy infant, so tender and mild.
[time=1188] Sleep in heavenly peace.
[time=1206] [MUSIC]
[time=1219] To a tiny place that's called Bethlehem town.
[time=1230] Christ the blessed Savior from heaven came down.
[time=1241] Show us where the tidings the angels did bring.
[time=1251] Overhill and clinical, so let it ring.
[time=1262] Christ the Savior is born.
[time=1277] [MUSIC]
[time=1293] Silent and so holy divine was the night.
[time=1303] Wondrous was the star that sent down his pure light.
[time=1313] With the heavenly angels now let us all sing.
[time=1324] Show us hallelujah to heaven to thee.
[time=1334] Christ the Savior is born.
[time=1381] Thank you ladies, even with the snow.
[time=1384] Let's take our hymnals now and turn to him number 106 and sing, "Hark the Herald Angels Sing, glory to the newborn king." Just one stanza of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing."
[time=1400] Singing together.
[time=1403] "Hark the Herald Angels Sing, glory to the newborn king."
[time=1457] Thank you.
[time=1462] And we invite you to open your copy of the sacred word from the Father.
[time=1467] We call it the Bible, the Scriptures, and turn with me to the Book of Matthew and the first chapter and the 18th verse.
[time=1476] Our Scripture lesson is Matthew chapter 1 verses 18 through 25.
[time=1486] Now the birth of Jesus was in this way.
[time=1490] When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1498] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.
[time=1506] But while he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1521] And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins." Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophets, saying, "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel." Which being interpreted as God with us.
[time=1545] Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.
[time=1560] Shall we pray?
[time=1563] Father, we thank you for this wonderful record of the birth of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1571] We thank you for the documentation of that truth found in the sacred word.
[time=1578] We ask that you will open our hearts to hear as if for the very first time this story,
[time=1584] and to examine the evidence that helps us to understand how very wonderful
[time=1590] and miraculous the birth of the Lord Jesus really is.
[time=1595] And we pray that if there are those who hear my voice in this Christmas season, who do not know the Lord Jesus, today will be the day of salvation for them.
[time=1606] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1611] I was rummaging through some magazines in my library some days ago,
[time=1619] I found an old copy of a Christian magazine for the month of December,
[time=1625] and as I was leafing through it, the title of an article jumped off the page.
[time=1631] The article was entitled "Satan Hates Christmas."
[time=1637] And I thought to myself, I'm not sure that's true.
[time=1640] For I wonder sometimes if Satan doesn't look at what happens at the Christmas season I think it's his birthday instead of the birthday of the Lord Jesus, all of the festivities that seem to ignore the Lord Jesus and keep him out of the picture, all of the things we get involved in that sort of take our mind and our focus away from Christ.
[time=1662] And I thought to myself, certainly Satan must think that's falling right in line with what his plan is, which is to divert the attention of mankind from the Savior.
[time=1672] And then I began to think about that, and I realized in my own heart that the title of that article was indeed the truth.
[time=1679] Satan does hate Christmas.
[time=1682] And the reason he hates Christmas is because Christmas is a time when we celebrate the supernatural miraculous birth of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1694] the incredible incarnation.
[time=1697] And Satan would do all in his power to desuper naturalize the Word of God.
[time=1704] If he can somehow get the supernatural out of the stories of the Word of God,
[time=1710] if he can get the modernistic theologians to take their knives to the Word of God and take all of the miracles out and all of the supernatural out, then he has simply another human book, which is placed on the same level as all human books.
[time=1724] And his great passion in his program is to do away with the miraculous,
[time=1730] and men and women never has there been an event in history, which is so filled with the miraculous as the event of our Lord's birth.
[time=1739] Indeed, it was the incredible incarnation.
[time=1743] Next week, we are going to deal specifically with the part of his birth,
[time=1750] which is the most well known in terms of the miraculous.
[time=1754] We call it the virgin birth of Christ.
[time=1756] It ought better to be called the virgin conception of Christ.
[time=1759] It has to do with the fact that Christ was born of a woman without a man, of the Holy Spirit, and we shall examine that next week.
[time=1769] But today, I want us to think about three reasons why the birth of Christ is incredible.
[time=1778] First of all, it is incredible because of the incredible prophecies which foretold his birth.
[time=1786] Thumbing through the pages of the Old Testament Scriptures, one can immediately locate the more familiar ones.
[time=1792] The book of Micah chapter 5 and verse 2 prophesied that he would come to Bethlehem to be born.
[time=1797] Isaiah chapter 7, 14, tells that he is to be born of a virgin.
[time=1803] Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 3 tells us that at his birth he would attract
[time=1809] great, gentile personalities to come and worship him.
[time=1813] In Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 15, the prophecy is clear that the birth of Jesus Christ would be an occasion for great suffering as many innocent children would be slain.
[time=1825] In the book of Hosea chapter 11 and verse 1, the prophet Hosea tells us that there would be a time in the infant life of Jesus when he would sojourn in Egypt.
[time=1836] And then, of course, we all know Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6, which gives to us the wonderful names of Jesus, wonderful counselor, etc.
[time=1845] And we could go on and on to multiply the Old Testament references that appeal to the miraculous prediction and prophecy of Christ.
[time=1855] But rather than examine them all, let us take just one and look into it in depth and see if we cannot discern in these moments we have together, that indeed the prophecy of Christ being born is supernatural and miraculous.
[time=1873] The prophecy that we would examine is the prophecy that he would be born
[time=1879] in a special place, that he would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=1884] The prediction of his birthplace.
[time=1887] In your Bibles in the book of Matthew and the second chapter, you have written for you in verses 5 and 6, the record of Herod's inquiry of the wise men and the scribes concerning where Jesus was to be born.
[time=1904] And we read in verse 5, and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet and thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
[time=1915] are not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governor
[time=1921] that shall rule my people Israel.
[time=1924] And verse 6 of Matthew chapter 2 is a quotation of Micah in the Old Testament,
[time=1931] chapter 5, verse 2.
[time=1933] It is simply taking the Old Testament prophecy of Micah and putting it here in this text and appealing to its authority, and saying Micah the prophet wrote that Jesus would be born in the town of Bethlehem.
[time=1946] Now Micah prophesied in 700 BC,
[time=1952] some 700 years before Christ was born.
[time=1956] You cannot read his book without reading the fifth chapter and the second verse,
[time=1962] and you cannot do away with the exact nature of his prophecy, saying that in Bethlehem Jesus would be born, you cannot take that out of its context and do away with its meaning 700 years before Jesus was born.
[time=1976] Micah said it will happen there in that town called Bethlehem.
[time=1982] His birth was foretold.
[time=1985] Back in 1765, James Boswell spent a few weeks on an island called Corsica.
[time=1993] While he was there, he made extended notes of all that he saw and heard.
[time=1998] But he did not know, and he could not know, that some four years later on that very island
[time=2004] would be born a man who would in 40 years have all of Europe at his feet.
[time=2010] That man who was born on that island was Napoleon Bonaparte.
[time=2014] But Boswell could not have known that, for to predict ahead of time the place where a person would be born is not within the province of humanity.
[time=2024] It is something that takes the supernatural.
[time=2027] And when we examine the nature of Micah's prophecy, we learn that he prophesied that Jesus would be born in the smallest country, Palestine. He picked one out of the 12 provinces of Palestine, and he said it will be in the province of Judah that he will be born.
[time=2044] And then out of Judah, he picked one small little village called Bethlehem,
[time=2050] and 700 years before it happened, he said, in Palestine,
[time=2056] in the province of Judah, in a little village called Bethlehem, the Savior will be born.
[time=2063] And the critics say, and the skeptics reason why Micah must have guessed,
[time=2072] and he guessed right.
[time=2074] And you know I like the critics and the skeptics.
[time=2078] The more you read them, the more you believe the Bible.
[time=2081] It takes more faith to believe a critic than it does to believe the Bible.
[time=2086] For you see, David was the only king who had ever been born in Bethlehem.
[time=2095] Every generation had come and gone, generation after generation, and every one of the kings had been born in the royal city of Jerusalem.
[time=2104] But David alone was born in Bethlehem.
[time=2107] And if I had been Micah and I were guessing, and I knew what I would know as Micah the prophet, why I would have certainly guessed that the newborn king were to be born in the royal city, and I would have dignified his birth by prophesying why he shall be born in Jerusalem.
[time=2123] In the holy city, in the royal city, the city where kings are born.
[time=2127] But he did not do that.
[time=2129] Micah said he's going to be born in Bethlehem.
[time=2133] Now when we examine the circumstances of his birth in Bethlehem, we are overwhelmed.
[time=2138] First of all, Mary and Joseph did not live in Bethlehem, why they lived in Galilee, a totally different province, some 90 miles away in a little city called Nazareth.
[time=2150] How would the birth ever take place in Bethlehem, and 90 miles to those folks is like 900 miles to us?
[time=2159] The only way that could happen was through the sovereignty of God who caused a Roman edict to be declared, that they would go to the town of their province, the head town, the place where they were to be registered.
[time=2173] And so the sovereign edict of God sent Mary and Joseph down to Bethlehem.
[time=2181] And that's where the child Jesus was born.
[time=2185] You see, if the conception had occurred six months earlier,
[time=2192] the baby would have been born in Nazareth, and Mary would have carried the babe in her arms to Bethlehem for the registration.
[time=2200] If the conception had occurred six months later, by the baby would by this time have returned to Nazareth with her mother,
[time=2211] and the baby would have been born there.
[time=2214] The baby would have been carried back in the mother's womb to Nazareth and been born in Nazareth, but exactly at that right time in those circumstances, the baby was born while Mary and Joseph were away from home, visiting for the purpose of registration in the town of Bethlehem.
[time=2230] And 700 years before that, Micah said, that's how it's going to happen.
[time=2236] The baby will be born in Bethlehem.
[time=2240] Now what possibility is there that any man by human wisdom could make such a prediction?
[time=2250] Think with me back into the history of our own country to 1276,
[time=2258] and some prophet stands up, and he says the President of the United States,
[time=2264] who is to be elected in 1976, will be born in Plains, Georgia.
[time=2271] And if history could chronicle that down through the years, and in essence, that's what happened, we would say of that prophet, why he had some supernatural revelation, because who would ever gather or think, or even guess, that a President would be born in Plains, Georgia?
[time=2290] What is a Plains, Georgia?
[time=2295] Plains, Georgia is to our country what Bethlehem was to the great surrounding area
[time=2301] where the prophecy was given, and men and women, when Micah said in Bethlehem, it shall happen.
[time=2309] It wasn't just some accident, it wasn't just some guess, some opportunity for a prophet to write while he had a vision, it was the hand of God in the birth of the sun, making sure that just as Micah said it would happen, it did happen.
[time=2327] It's incredible, it is incredible.
[time=2334] And what we know about this prophecy is exactly what we know about all the prophecies,
[time=2341] concerning the fact that he would be born of a virgin, and the Gentiles would come in prominence to worship.
[time=2348] Every single one of those prophecies was fulfilled to the minutest detail.
[time=2354] The incarnation is incredible men and women because of the incredible prophecies, which foretold his birth.
[time=2363] A few weeks ago, we were studying in our evening services the Book of Ruth, and at the end of that book, in the last chapter, there's a section called the genealogies.
[time=2374] And I mentioned to you that sometime in the Christmas season, we'd talk a bit about that.
[time=2379] And I'd like to share with you secondly that the incarnation of Christ is incredible because of the preservation of the line.
[time=2387] Now, follow me carefully.
[time=2390] You have your Bibles open to the Book of Matthew, and in the first chapter of Matthew, you have one of those passages of Scripture that you seem to always come to for your devotional reading on the day when you need something from God the worst, the genealogies.
[time=2405] I don't know how that happens to you, but quite often that happens to me.
[time=2409] And you sort of skip over that and go on to something else because it isn't too interesting to read that Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah, and Judah begot Paris, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2421] I heard a preacher say, "Only thing I get out of that whole passage is this.
[time=2425] If God said they begot them, bless God, they begot them." That's all I know.
[time=2432] But you know there's a great, great truth to be learned from this passage.
[time=2437] For here, in this genealogy of Joseph who was the foster father of the Savior,
[time=2444] we have a record of 42 generations, 42 generations.
[time=2451] That stretch back to Abraham 2,000 years from Christ.
[time=2458] There are in this genealogy some omissions that have not been included, but that does not do away with the accurate nature of all that is here, in a record of the line of Christ back through the years to Abraham.
[time=2475] Now, your Bibles are open, turn back to the book of Genesis and the 12th chapter, Genesis chapter 12.
[time=2484] Here is where the prophecy begins concerning the line of Jesus Christ.
[time=2491] We read in this Abrahamic covenant in the 12th chapter of Genesis, these words, "Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseeth thee,
[time=2514] and in thee, in thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed.' And then the Apostle Paul in the book of Galatians interprets that passage for us.
[time=2524] If you have your Bibles, turn to Galatians chapter 3 and verse 16.
[time=2528] Galatians 3.16.
[time=2530] Let me pause long enough to say that Galatians 3.16 is one of the great 3.16s of the Bible.
[time=2536] Sometime when you have an opportunity, take your Bibles and go through them looking at the 3.16s of each book,
[time=2542] you will find an unbelievable number of great verses that are addressed 3.16.
[time=2549] Galatians 3.16 appeals to the Old Testament prophecy to Abraham and notice what it says.
[time=2556] Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
[time=2560] He saith not and to seeds as of many, but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ.
[time=2569] When God said to Abraham that in his seed all families of the earth were to be blessed,
[time=2576] Paul said that God was saying to Abraham that in that seed Christ would come.
[time=2581] He would come through the line of Abraham.
[time=2584] And back in the book of Genesis you have to go just over to the 49th chapter of that book
[time=2590] where we have some 300 years later given to Jacob, a reminder of this great promise.
[time=2598] And Genesis 49 and verse 10 were told that this is the promise to Jacob.
[time=2604] The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh come
[time=2610] and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
[time=2614] 300 years after Abraham God said to Jacob the Savior will come through the line of Abraham and Jacob.
[time=2623] And then 650 years passed and if we could we would turn over to the book of 2 Samuel in chapter 7.
[time=2631] For there in that great chapter we are told that Jesus Christ is to be a descendant of Judah,
[time=2638] of David, of the son of Jesse that God through the prophet Nathan declared to David
[time=2646] that this Messiah who had been promised to Abraham and to Jacob was to come from Abraham to Jacob
[time=2652] through that line and through the line of David.
[time=2655] And that it was through David's flesh and his descendants that Jesus Christ was to be born.
[time=2661] And you remember in the book of Ruth we picked up the story there that Ruth was related to David and that through all of that prophecy Jesus Christ was to come.
[time=2671] Now this prophecy given to David was 1440 years before Christ was born.
[time=2677] Why you say pastor that's not incredible? That's not miraculous.
[time=2681] Everybody has a father and every father has a grandfather and a great grandfather.
[time=2686] Everybody has descendants. We all have roots and so why should this be a thing thought incredible?
[time=2691] Let me see if I can illustrate to you what I'm talking about.
[time=2695] When you begin to read the genealogies of the Bible you begin to see what such a series of promises to these men necessitated.
[time=2704] That God was required to keep the messianic line from Abraham all the way up to Joseph and to Christ.
[time=2713] From Abraham down to the time of the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2718] That this line had to be kept fertile in such a way that there would be born in this Davidic line
[time=2724] coming down through Abraham, Jacob and Judah and subsequently through David and Solomon at least one male child.
[time=2732] In every generation who would grow up and likewise have a son there would be no broken succession of male descendants
[time=2744] from one generation to the next until our Lord should be born of Judah.
[time=2749] Why you say pastor I don't think that's so incredible.
[time=2752] I don't see how that should be so hard to be fulfilled for two thousand years.
[time=2761] Let's see if we can come up with an up-to-date illustration that will help us to understand how incredible it really is.
[time=2769] Perhaps we can illustrate this from the life of the great President Abraham Lincoln.
[time=2775] Abraham Lincoln had four children.
[time=2778] Robert Todd, Edward Baker, William Wallace and Thomas.
[time=2785] Of these four children, one of them died in infancy.
[time=2790] One died in youth and one in early manhood before marriage.
[time=2795] The only one of President Lincoln's children to marry was Robert Todd.
[time=2801] Who had three children, two daughters, Mary and Jesse and one son, Abraham, who was born in 1873.
[time=2809] But Abraham died in 1890 before he could get married before he had any children.
[time=2814] While it is true that Mary had a son by her husband, whom she named Lincoln,
[time=2822] and her sister Jesse had a son by her husband, whom she named Robert Lincoln,
[time=2829] yet the direct male line from Abraham Lincoln is today extinct.
[time=2839] An extinction that took just three generations.
[time=2846] It is now impossible for Abraham Lincoln to have anywhere in our country a grandson born of his own son, or a great grandson born of a son of Robert Todd.
[time=2858] That which was terminated in less than a century in the line of that great man, men and women,
[time=2867] was preserved and continued for two thousand years by God Almighty,
[time=2875] so that the promise made to Abraham in Genesis 12 could be fulfilled in Matthew chapter 2 when Christ was born.
[time=2887] Oh, that's incredible. That's incredible.
[time=2893] That's supernatural. That's miraculous.
[time=2899] That didn't just happen. That isn't possible by chance.
[time=2904] God in heaven had his hand, his sovereign hand upon the events, that all that he promised would happen, and every single generation was preserved for 42 separate generations over two thousand years,
[time=2919] so that Jesus Christ could be born and be a child of prophecy. Amen. Amen.
[time=2928] Thirdly, let's take it right up to the time of Jesus' birth and talk for a moment about the incredible prediction of the child Jesus to Mary and Joseph.
[time=2938] We have in the first chapter of Matthew in verse 21 these words which the angel said to Joseph, the foster father of Jesus,
[time=2948] he said, "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shall call his name Jesus, and he shall save his people from their sins."
[time=2956] We read that so glibly, passing over it. It's part of the story.
[time=2962] Tonight in churches all over the country, narrators will read that with nary a thought to what it means.
[time=2969] But men and women, do you realize what happened when the angel said that to Joseph?
[time=2974] The angel said to Joseph, "Mary is going to have a child, and it's going to be a baby boy."
[time=2985] Now I looked all over this morning for the doctors in our fellowship. I wanted to find out what is the latest state of the art for determining the sex of a child before birth.
[time=2996] I understand it can be done. Somebody told me that.
[time=3000] But I don't know who's taking advantage of it because everybody I talk to who's going to have a baby born into their home is in question right down to the last minute.
[time=3009] Is it going to be a boy or a girl? But remember now, we're not talking about 1980. We're talking 2000 years earlier than that.
[time=3019] And the angel said to Joseph, "Your wife's going to have a child. It'll be a boy. It'll be a boy."
[time=3027] Someone says, "Well, you know, there you can guess. You got a 50% chance."
[time=3035] Now take it another step. And he said to Joseph, "That boy who's to be born, let me tell you what he's going to do.
[time=3048] If I could be almost irreverent for a moment, what his occupation will be?
[time=3054] He shall save his people from their sins. He's going to be the Redeemer, the Savior of all mankind.
[time=3062] A boy is going to be born, and he's going to be the Redeemer."
[time=3068] I dare say there's not a one of you here that has a child as old as ten.
[time=3075] That could tell me right now with certainty what your child's going to do.
[time=3080] I look into the eyes of my four children. I think, well, maybe one of them will be a preacher. That'd be good.
[time=3088] But I don't have any idea. And if you listen to him, you're going to get very confused.
[time=3093] But the angel said to Joseph, "It's going to be a boy, and he will be the Redeemer of the world."
[time=3102] That's incredible. Martin Luther's mother did not know that her babe would be a reformer.
[time=3110] Thomas Edison's mother did not know that her babe would by inventions illuminate the western world.
[time=3117] Abraham Lincoln's mother did not know that her son would one day be the President of the United States.
[time=3125] We have thousands of men and women in the penitentiaries of our nation.
[time=3132] Isn't it fortunate that no father or mother could ever foresee
[time=3138] when any of these prisoners was a babe in arms that one day they would be a prisoner?
[time=3145] We do not know. We cannot know. Perhaps in many cases it is more most fortunate that we do not know
[time=3154] what our children will be, what they will become.
[time=3159] But the angel did know this. That the babe who was to be born to marry, who was still unborn, would be the savior of the world.
[time=3170] Isn't that incredible?
[time=3175] And there are many other evidences. Just like these three, which just pile up one upon another
[time=3183] to demonstrate that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, it wasn't just another birth.
[time=3189] It was the miraculous birth of the Son of God.
[time=3194] I read a poignant story this week about a father who was having difficulty with his young son.
[time=3205] About a ten-year-old lad who was very rebellious wouldn't behave, wouldn't obey his mother, wouldn't do what he was told.
[time=3212] The father tried everything he knew how to get that son in line.
[time=3216] He spanked him and he took his privileges away and finally one day in exasperation when his son had talked back to his mother.
[time=3225] The father said, "Young man, the next time you do that, I'm going to send you to the attic without your supper and you're going to stay there all night to think about what you're doing."
[time=3234] Oh, I gasped when I thought about that. I don't believe I could ever do that. I'd have to be awful angry to do that.
[time=3240] We don't even have an attic, so that would really be in trouble.
[time=3245] But you know, the next day, that young boy repeated his activity of the day before almost exactly.
[time=3253] And he was stuck. He had promised him what he was going to do and the conditions were met and now he had to do it.
[time=3261] Every parent's been in that spot at least once in their life.
[time=3266] Make some offhand comment about what you're going to do and not think it'll ever happen and then it happens and you're stuck.
[time=3273] And he was trying to get out of it and his wife said, "Honey, you can't. If you don't follow through on that, he will never again believe you and you must do it."
[time=3281] And so he sent the young boy upstairs. Oh, he couldn't hardly believe he was doing it.
[time=3290] And within a half hour, he went up there with him and he stayed there with him all night and he put his arm around him and they slept in the attic all night.
[time=3306] And I thought to myself, "That's what God did for me." I deserved the judgment of God.
[time=3314] He said, "The wages of sin is death and I sinned."
[time=3321] And he did more for me than that father did for the son.
[time=3325] He went up in the attic and he sent me down and he took it all.
[time=3332] And folks, of all the things I know of the incarnation, that is the most incredible.
[time=3340] That he would love me enough to do that and he loves you too and he came into this world to take your punishment so that you could go and live in his world and be free.
[time=3352] And he offers that to you freely if you will just accept it and you can do it today. Let's pray together.
[time=3363] If you don't know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you can know him. You can know him right now.
[time=3369] You can trust him, invite him into your heart and accept him as your Lord and he will come in and be yours.
[time=3376] All you have to do is pray and say, "Lord Jesus, come into my heart and he'll do it. He'll do it now. Let's bow together."
[time=3384] Father, it is incredible to think that you loved us so much to send your son into our world.
