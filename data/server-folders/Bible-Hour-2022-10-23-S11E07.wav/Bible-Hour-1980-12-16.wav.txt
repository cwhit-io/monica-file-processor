[time=10] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=22] [ Singing ]
[time=50] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=53] [SILENCE]
[time=56] This is the Christmas season, and one of the great joys of this time of the year is the music of the Advent.
[time=64] And today, we're going to be sharing the ministry of our choir and of our junior choir, star in our wall, and the millers are going to be singing all of it is music about the coming to this earth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=77] Right now, let's listen to the ministry of our choir as they begin our worship unto the Lord.
[time=83] [MUSIC]
[time=113] [ Singing ]
[time=267] Thank you, choir.
[time=268] We're going to ask our ushers to come forward so that we can prepare our gifts to give unto the Lord.
[time=273] While they're coming, please listen carefully to these announcements.
[time=277] I guess it's not time to do that yet, is it?
[time=280] We won't take the offering.
[time=282] All of you folks who are joining us in television, we don't take the offering at this time.
[time=286] It's time to hear some more music.
[time=288] So, I guess I'm just programmed.
[time=291] In the early service, the miller sang during the offering, and I thought when I saw them come out, it was time to take the offering.
[time=296] I hope you don't have that effect on me every time I see you from now on.
[time=299] But for whatever it's worth, go ahead and sing, and we'll take the offering later.
[time=304] All right?
[time=306] [MUSIC]
[time=334] When God came down, He filled the world with music.
[time=343] A song of peace and hope were lost in pride.
[time=353] Not just a true force, ever made of reasons.
[time=363] A amazing grace and sin has made a song.
[time=373] When God came down, He filled the world with wonder.
[time=382] The brighter God, and all the stars that shine.
[time=392] You're just a song.
[time=396] [MUSIC]
[time=409] When God became a man,
[time=420] He introduced a plan that revolutionized the course of history.
[time=429] So many things had changed.
[time=432] A world of new horizons took the place of a world that used to be.
[time=441] Giving then took on a different meaning.
[time=446] Through the selfless way He showed us how to live.
[time=453] And all of life takes on a new complexion.
[time=459] When we see in Him the life, He came to give.
[time=469] When God came down, He filled the world with music.
[time=479] A song of peace and hope were lost in pride.
[time=489] Not just a true force, ever made of reasons.
[time=499] A amazing grace and sin has made a song.
[time=509] When God came down, He filled the world with wonder.
[time=518] The brighter God, and all the stars that shine.
[time=528] He comes just a song.
[time=532] In man's imagination, He was America.
[time=544] He was a world of love and love.
[time=550] He gave love.
[time=558] [MUSIC]
[time=565] A few days ago, I had the opportunity of sitting down to write to many of my friends who watched the Bible Our Television Program.
[time=573] I'm certain many of you watching have already received that letter.
[time=576] In the letter I told the story of a woman who had been touched deeply by the ministry of this telecast.
[time=582] The letter asked for your help during this Christmas season, and as we closed the year of 1979,
[time=588] you know that we might face the new year with a clean slate and be able to move into 1980
[time=594] with all of the strength that is available to us to devote to the ministry of the Bible Our.
[time=599] If you have not already received that letter, you will be receiving it in just a few days.
[time=604] I hope you will read it carefully and that you will do everything you can to be an encouragement to us during this season.
[time=611] Christmas is a very wonderful time of the year, but in many respects it's a very strange time of the year too, isn't it, Donna?
[time=619] Yes, it really is.
[time=620] I was having a discussion with our little four-year-old Jennifer the other morning and trying to make sure that she understood the real meaning of Christmas.
[time=628] And I was explaining to her that it was Jesus' birthday that we were celebrating.
[time=633] And she got this puzzled little look on her face and she said, "Well, Mommy, if it's Jesus' birthday, how come I get the presents?"
[time=641] Well, that's a very interesting question, and it supposedly is the birthday of our Savior.
[time=647] We celebrate His incarnation on that day.
[time=650] We believe that He came into this world on a specific day, and yet it is a rather strange thing that on the day
[time=656] that is dedicated to remembering our Lord's birthday, so very few people remember Him in a tangible way with a gift to His work.
[time=665] That's why we think Christmas is a great time to be giving to the Lord and to His ministry, and we'd like for you to consider the possibility of making the Bible hour one of the ways that you give to the Lord during this Christmas season.
[time=678] And if you can send a special gift at this time to help in the Bible, our ministry, it would be very much appreciated.
[time=685] For all of you who can send a gift of at least $15, we'd like to send you this very beautiful edition of the New King James Bible, the New Testament.
[time=694] It is a red-letter edition of a very, very good translation of the Scriptures.
[time=699] Most of us have grown up on the King James Bible and love it, and this is an updated King James Bible that you will appreciate.
[time=707] This is one of the very first editions to be off the press.
[time=710] We'd like to send it into your home as a way of expressing to you our appreciation.
[time=715] For every gift of at least $15 to the Bible hour ministry, we'll mail your copy of the King James Bible, the New Testament, this week.
[time=723] We hope we'll hear from you in these next few days, and Donna, how do they get in touch with us?
[time=728] If you would like to have your copy of the New King James Bible, all you need to do is write to Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=735] Post Office Box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we'll be sure to get your copy in the mail to you.
[time=745] And of course the Bible is of no value to you if you don't read it.
[time=748] That's why we're putting together with the Bible a very special Bible reading program called The Daily Walk.
[time=754] The Daily Walk is a method to read through the Bible in one year.
[time=759] And if you will get in touch with us right away, we'll be able to get back to you so that you can start with us on the very first day of January reading The Daily Walk.
[time=768] Now The Daily Walk is a Bible study guide that helps you to read through the scriptures in a meaningful way.
[time=775] Each day there is an assignment for reading.
[time=777] There's a special little checklist for you to keep track of how you're doing and where you are in your reading.
[time=783] There's an introduction to each lesson and an application for each lesson.
[time=788] I believe The Daily Walk is the finest Bible study method available in our world today.
[time=794] And it will help you to get into the Word of God and make it meaningful in your own life.
[time=798] Once again, if you'd like to have the January issue of The Daily Walk, please get in touch with our office and we'll be happy to send it to you.
[time=805] And in sending it, we'll let you know how you can receive The Daily Walk each month through this next year.
[time=810] Now Donna, we have some wonderful people who have helped us over these past months as sponsors and associate sponsors.
[time=816] And by that I mean they've given to us a substantial gift to help cover the cost of airtime where this television program is seen.
[time=824] And today we have quite a list of associate sponsors and I want you to share the names of these folks with our friends at home.
[time=831] Okay, we have four associate sponsors today. Thomas Hively, who is a channel 21 viewer.
[time=840] Edith S. Stanford, who watches on channel 38. Kenneth Lup, also channel 21.
[time=849] And Jay Howell, who watches on channel 21 in Fort Wayne.
[time=853] And we express our appreciation to these our friends, associate sponsors and to all of our Founders Club members who make the Bible our reality.
[time=860] And we thank you for your faithfulness in giving to this ministry.
[time=864] Once again, before we go back to our service, let me remind you that your gift during this year-end season would be greatly appreciated and a tremendous help to us.
[time=872] And for all who send a gift of at least $15, we'll be sending to you the new edition of the King James Bible, the New Testament.
[time=880] A red letter edition of what I think is one of the finest translations of the New Testament available today.
[time=886] Before we go back to the service, let me remind you to keep praying for us.
[time=890] And your encouragement through the mail is a great help to all of us who labor here in the Bible our ministry.
[time=897] Now in just a few moments, we're going to be opening the Bible to the Book of Titus.
[time=901] And I want to speak to you about the subject of the Epiphany.
[time=906] We have many churches called Epiphany Churches. We have a season of the year that is celebrated in some churches called the Feast of Epiphany.
[time=915] Today we're going to talk about what the word means and how it's related to the Christmas story and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=922] So have your Bibles ready and perhaps a piece of paper and a pencil so you can jot down some notes.
[time=927] We'll be studying the Scripture together in just a moment.
[time=932] This is a great carol and we'll remain seated as we sing it as our offering continues to be taken.
[time=941] Everyone together.
[time=971] [MUSIC]
[time=994] Thank you for the good singing.
[time=998] Christmas is a time when children are in the forefront.
[time=1003] If you have children in your home as I do in mine who are at the most exciting age for the Christmas time then you know something of the excitement that's in the air.
[time=1013] And so we think that Christmas ought to have children in it here in the church and in our services.
[time=1019] Our junior choir is going to sing for us now about the love of Jesus which was certainly evidenced in his coming to this earth and I know you're going to enjoy their presentation of it right now.
[time=1032] Long ago even before he made the world God chose us to be his very own.
[time=1039] We who stand before him cover in his love.
[time=1045] [MUSIC]
[time=1071] Flowers and trees.
[time=1076] Fresh and green.
[time=1079] And we like to.
[time=1084] Jesus love.
[time=1088] All of his creation.
[time=1091] But best of all.
[time=1094] Jesus love you and Jesus love me.
[time=1102] Look at the birds.
[time=1104] They don't worry about what to eat.
[time=1106] They don't sow or reap or store up food for your heavenly Father feeds them and you are far more valuable to him than they are.
[time=1116] Jesus love is kind of blue.
[time=1125] It's not a new and rainy days too.
[time=1132] Jesus love's curling bones.
[time=1141] Funny words until it comes to you.
[time=1149] Jesus loves all of his creation.
[time=1155] But best of all.
[time=1160] Jesus love you and Jesus love me.
[time=1168] His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by sending Jesus Christ to die for us.
[time=1176] And he did this because he wanted to.
[time=1182] Jesus loves all of his creation.
[time=1188] But best of all.
[time=1191] Jesus love you and Jesus love me.
[time=1199] Jesus loves you.
[time=1203] Jesus loves me.
[time=1230] Thank you children and we want to hear more from them in the days ahead.
[time=1234] Thank you Mr. Krueger for your work of labor and love with our children.
[time=1238] Now before the message we're going to listen to the ministry of star Narwhal.
[time=1242] We have a hymn of the month in our church and this month because it is the month of the Christmas season.
[time=1248] We've been singing together what child is this.
[time=1251] An old Christmas tune and stars going to sing that now just before the message from the Word of God.
[time=1259] [MUSIC]
[time=1346] [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=1427] Thank you, Star.
[time=1429] Those of you who were with us in our banquet last weekend know that Star has a new album that's just been released.
[time=1436] Many of you took them home with you.
[time=1438] I learned yesterday when I was having breakfast with Star's father who was a used car salesman or car salesman here in our city that he has a new plan now.
[time=1447] He includes the price of an album with every car that he sells.
[time=1451] So if you're interested in a two for one program and you need a new car and you like to get an album you can go that route but the other way and maybe more commensurate with all of us is that you'll have a table in the foyer today and if you didn't get a chance to get the album entitled Star you need to have that because it's a great blessing and every song has something to say.
[time=1472] Our Bibles are open today to the Book of Titus, the Book of Titus, clear at the end of the New Testament toward the Book of Revelation right after the books of Timothy and before the Book of Philemon is a little booklet by the name of Titus, a letter written to a young minister
[time=1493] from the aged Paul with instruction for his life, Titus chapter 2.
[time=1501] And I'm reading from my copy of God's Word, Titus chapter 2 verses 11 through 14.
[time=1509] Titus chapter 2 verses 11 through 14.
[time=1513] For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
[time=1519] teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present age, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people of his own zealous of good works.
[time=1541] These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority, let no man despise thee.
[time=1551] Now as a church we do not normally observe the religious calendar.
[time=1557] By that I mean we are not prone to take up all of the traditional things that have grown up in the church from the beginning of it.
[time=1566] We are not what you would call a traditional church in that sense.
[time=1570] We are very simple in our form of worship and we observe only those days which have a meaning as it relates to the doctrine of the Word of God.
[time=1579] There are churches that are more traditional than this and they have special holy days and feast days throughout the year.
[time=1587] One such day that is observed in some Episcopal churches and in other churches is what is called the Feast of Epiphany.
[time=1596] Epiphany Sunday is usually, Epiphany Sunday is the sixth or the closest to time to the sixth of January and the Feast of Epiphany comes 12 nights after Christmas night.
[time=1609] It is the time when those who observe the tradition take down their yule tied decorations and the Epiphany is a special traditional time with those who understand it in that light.
[time=1623] I've often wondered if those who have the term Epiphany associated with the name of their church or with their school or who observe the Feast of Epiphany understand what the term means.
[time=1635] For the word Epiphany is a transliteration right out of the Greek language.
[time=1640] It is in other words a word which we say as closely to the way you would say it in Greek
[time=1646] as we are able to in our English pronunciation.
[time=1649] The word Epiphany comes from the Greek word Epiphanase which means an appearing, a becoming visible that which has been hidden which now comes to light.
[time=1661] It is not something which has been nonexistent which begins to be but it is something which has been but which has not been seen or known by those who are surrounding it.
[time=1672] And so the word Epiphany means to appear.
[time=1675] It means to become visible.
[time=1678] If I were to take the text which we have read this morning and insert the word Epiphany where it is in the Greek language of the New Testament I am certain you will understand it.
[time=1688] So let me do that in two verses.
[time=1690] First of all in verse 11.
[time=1692] For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath made an Epiphany to all men.
[time=1705] Once again we find the word in the 13th verse of this same chapter looking for that blessed hope and the glorious Epiphany of the great God in our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1717] So the word Epiphany means to appear, to become visible, to be seen where in times past it has been hidden.
[time=1725] Now the word Epiphany in the Bible is used in the New Testament 11 times for the appearances of Christ.
[time=1733] For his first Advent his Epiphany at Bethlehem and his second Advent which we know as the revelation when he will come in great glory and he will put into process his kingdom here on this earth and we shall be with him as saints to reign. The word Epiphany means to appear and in the Bible there are two times when the word is used in relationship to Jesus Christ. When he came at Bethlehem and when he comes in the future to reign in glory with his own. Four times in the New Testament the word Epiphany refers to the incarnation or Christ coming at Bethlehem. Perhaps the most famous of these references is found back in the book of Luke in the first chapter in what is known as the Benedictus and those of you who are familiar with the traditional terms that surround the Christmas story know that this is the statement by the father of John the Baptist as he reviews God's dealing in his own life. And in Luke chapter 1 verses 78 and 79 we read these words through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace. The words to give light are simply a translation of the term Epiphany to make an appearance of to become visible to give light to us. That was the purpose of Jesus Christ coming into the world to in a wonderful way visibly demonstrate God to man. To take that which had been hidden in the past and make it visible to us in the present. And so in this passage which we have read from the book of Titus we have a reference to the Epiphany of God in his grace. Now there are two Advent's the coming of Christ in Bethlehem and his coming in glory. Those of us who understand the doctrine of the rapture know that that is the first stage of the second Advent. There are really just two comings of Christ to this earth. When he came as a baby to be born in a manger and when he comes again to set up his kingdom and to rule among men these are the two Advent's of the Savior. Both of them are mentioned in our text.
[time=1881] We want to consider them together today as the message God would have for us at the beginning of this Advent season. First of all I want you to notice the Epiphany of God's grace or his incarnation.
[time=1893] We read of it in Titus chapter 2 verse 11 where we're told that the appearing of Jesus Christ has come into this world in order to make known his grace.
[time=1905] For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath made an Epiphany to all men. Now if you have your Bibles with you I would like for you to turn back just a couple of pages to 2 Timothy chapter 1 verses 9 and 10. 2 Timothy 1 9 and 10. Here we have another word Epiphany used and translated in the Gospels or in the narrative of the New Testament. 2 Timothy 1 9 and 10 and we read these words who have saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the Epiphany of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and have brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. This is a reference to the time when Jesus Christ came into this world and he made God visible to men and he caused the grace of God to be visibly understood by all who saw him.
[time=1969] Now if you understand the Lord Jesus coming into this world you know that he came in a humble way. He came to be born of a humble Jewish virgin. He came to be born in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes attended by the lowing animals and surrounded by the worshiping shepherds. There was nothing magnificent nothing great nothing full of glory in his first coming to this earth. He came to demonstrate the grace of God who thought it not robbery to be equal with God came and made himself of no reputation and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross. When Jesus came into this world he came to demonstrate God's grace. That's why we read in John chapter 1 verse 14 and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth Jesus Christ was God's picture of grace to this world. You say how is that? Well it is so simple to understand when you understand what he was before he came. He was the prince of glory. He was the the object of attention in heaven. He was the and is the only eternal son of God. He was heaven's greatest gift, heaven's most expensive commodity. He was all that heaven is and much more and God the Father looked upon him with loving eyes and said I will give my son to a wicked and denying world. I will demonstrate my grace to this undeserving world by sending my son to die for their sin. And the Bible says Jesus Christ came down from heaven's glory, walked among men and went to the cross and he died and he demonstrated the grace of God.
[time=2081] He is God's picture of grace to man.
[time=2085] Now we see his grace in his coming at
[time=2093] Bethlehem and in the manger but we see his grace most of all in his dying and it's interesting to me as I've studied these passages that have the word epiphany in them that all of the passages that deal with his first advent, his coming to this world, deal mainly with his death upon the cross and so it is here in Titus. You just look down a few verses from verse 11 that mentions his coming at Bethlehem and in verse 14 you read these words who gave himself for us that he might redeem us of all iniquity and purify unto himself of people of his own zealous of good works. The grace of God was demonstrated most of all not in the manger though that was a humble setting. His grace was demonstrated when the Lord of glory hung on the cross stretched between two thieves and all of the sin of the world upon his back more undeserving a person one could not find but here he was hanging and representing the sin of all the universe and he died there at the expense of our sin because God loved us enough to demonstrate his grace in such a way. And this text which we have read verse 14 tells us several things about that death first of all it was substitutionary death. He redeemed us he gave himself for us that means that he put himself in our place where we deserve to die he died he gave himself for me I belong there he took my place he did it for me that's substitutionary death Jesus dying in my place not only does it teach the doctrine of substitution but it teaches the doctrine of redemption who redeemed us that means he bought us he paid the price for us and purchased us out of the marketplace of sin he paid the full price for me he bought me from sin and set me free he redeemed us the bible says he redeemed us from all iniquity that's the doctrine of emancipation before Jesus came to die had he not come to die in my place I would have been enslaved to my sinful flesh but he has set me free he has set me free to live unto him I have been emancipated it is the doctrine of substitution and redemption and emancipation and it is also the doctrine of sanctification for he did it that I might be a special kind of person purified to be like God so when Jesus Christ made his first epiphany when he came and was born in Bethlehem he demonstrated God's grace when he went to the cross and died for our sins so we can say that the first Advent was the epiphany of God's grace God demonstrating his grace and his love for us now I said there are two Advent's and I spoke the truth he has come and he will come he has appeared and he will appear he came in the past and he is coming in the future we have looked at his epiphany of grace but notice that in this very same text in Titus we have a reference to the epiphany or the appearance of his glory for it says in verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious epiphany of the great God in our Savior Jesus Christ his coming in glory will not be like his coming in grace his coming in glory will not be to come to a cross but his coming in glory will be that which is accompanied by the crown that he wears his coming in glory will not be in a manger but his coming in glory will be to be seated upon a throne his coming in glory will not be to appear in an announcement to some shepherds on a lonely dark hillside out of Bethlehem but his coming in glory will be to be accompanied by the angels and the saints and every eye shall see him in his glory will be seen from one end of the world to the other his coming in glory will not be to a stable but to this whole world his coming in glory will not be in humility but in power his first epiphany was the revelation of God's grace but men and women there is coming a time when every eye shall see him and he will be seen in all of his glory at this Christmas season as sometimes Jesus Christ and his first epiphany is lost in the shuttle of all of the traditions and problems that we have in our present time and the commercialism of our day and the busy schedules which all of us are following and the parties and all the rest of it his epiphany in grace seems to be lost I want you to know that there's coming a day when his glory will be revealed and every eye shall see him and no one will have any excuse for not recognizing that he is indeed the Lord of glory the son of God who is worthy of our adoration every knee shall bow he is coming again in glory so we have the past is coming in grace and the future is coming in glory this pole and that one and in between is the present and you say pastor Jeremiah what difference does it make that he appeared in grace and that he's going to appear in glory well the bible is a very intensely practical book and I want to point out to you that because he has come in the past and because he is coming in the future there is something that God wants to say to us today in fact it is so it is so magnificently and pointedly shown to us in the text that we cannot miss it in Titus chapter 2 and verse 12 we are told that the purpose of his coming in grace is in order that he might teach us notice that his coming was for the purpose of teaching us something notice that the end of this verse tells us the time frame in which this teaching is to take place in our lives teaching us so that we will be certain kinds of people when in this present age now get the timeline in mind he made an epiphany in the past when he came to this earth to demonstrate his grace he's making an epiphany in the future when he comes in glory but in between those two appearances God has something to say to us he wants to teach us something so that we'll be this kind of people in this present age and what is it that he wants to say to us well if you read the book of Titus you can't help but note it's intensely practical and it goes through instructions for almost every conceivable problem within the church the theme of the book of Titus is the theme of good works it is mentioned over and again in the book but right here in this limited context that we have before us we have some instructions from God in heaven that encourage us to be doing certain things in our lives because he has appeared and because he will appear those are the terminus and we're in the middle and God wants to teach us some things and I hope we'll listen with all of our hearts what kind of person ought I to be because he has come and because he is coming well notice what it says teaching us denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present age now there are several things that God says to us in light of the fact that he has come and that he is coming first of all he tells us that it's important that we understand the word denunciation deny say no to we're living in a time when it's not very fashionable to be negative about anything I'm not a negative person I don't like to be involved in negative situations they're very fatiguing and very tiring I don't like to be around negative people for a long period of time they sort of just great on you until pretty soon you just worn down but that is not to say that it is never right to say no in fact if you'll stop and think about it for a moment you'll understand that in order for you to be positive about any one thing you've got to be negative about some things that are opposite to that for instance I'm positive about God so I'm negative about anything that is anti-God I am positive about salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone so I'm negative about anything that corrupts that or makes it difficult or adds to it I'm positive about the family so I'm negative about anything that would come in to destroy the family I'm positive about the local church and so I'm negative about anything that tries to usurp the place of the local church because I'm positive about these things then I have to be negative about those things and that may seem like an awful trite statement for me to make but there are an awful lot of syrupy sentimental people walking around today that give you the impression that you can be positive about everything at one in the same time so they're positive about this woman at the same time they're positive about that woman and while they're married to this one they're being positive to that one now that doesn't mean you should hate everybody but your wife but it means you better have a positive attitude towards your wife in a whole different way than you have a positive attitude about anybody else's wife but we've just gotten this idea that everything's alright everything's positive everything's fine but the Bible says that when you become a Christian because of Christ coming in the past and because of His coming in the future there are certain things you're going to deny and there are two of them listed in this text one of them is ungodliness and the other is worldly lusts ungodliness is just what it says it means
[time=2695] you're going to say no to that which is an opposition to God before you became a Christian your life was characterized by being ungodly that doesn't mean you were as bad as you could be but that means that in every area of your life you were corrupted and you were basically an opposition to God in His plan for your life you were ungodly you were a person minus God now you're a Christian and because Christ came to pay the price for your sin and because someday He's coming back again the Bible says you are to deny ungodliness in your life you're to say no to it and when influences begin to come into your life they're in opposition to God you're to say no
[time=2733] I will not I'll not allow that to have a part in my life the text goes on to say that we're to deny not only ungodliness but we're to deny worldly lusts now it's unfortunate that in that text the concept of worldly lust is usually given some sort of sexual connotation obvious it is possible to lust in the appetites of the body and that's sinful but it is far more wide sweeping than just the sexual appetites it has to do with the lust for more and the lust for material things and the desire to wrap your arms around all that is in the world and draw it to yourself and become a connoisseur of everything that the world has to offer to get all that you can of what's available now and to bring it to yourself and just to grab and reach and consume and try to be a materialist in the truest sense of the word the Bible says that a Christian is not a person who is going like this but a person who is going like that and giving away and being gracious and loving and open armed and hospitable and so when you become a Christian because you've understood that Christ has come into this world to pay for your sin you are not involved in worldly lust but you are a person with a giving open heart ready to meet the needs of all around you as God impresses your heart with them and you deny worldly lust in your own life you say how do you do it well you just do it you just say no that's the forgotten word in our society I've listened to child experts who try to tell you every way under the sun to say no to your children except say no and I've discovered that my kids pretty much understand what the word no means I just say no and I don't give long explanations or detailed exposés I just say no no means no and the Bible says that as Christians if we're going to live the kind of lives that God will be honored with because he came in the past and he's coming in the future we need to denounce certain things in our own lives secondly the Bible talks not only about denying some things but it talks about a disciplined kind of lifestyle here in the text we're told that we are to deny ungodliness and worldly lust and then we're to live in three ways soberly, righteously and godly now these three terms have to do with our relationship to ourselves and our relationship to others and our relationship to God first of all the Bible says we're to live soberly now that does not mean the absence of alcohol though it may have some connotations there it has to do with a serious purpose and intense desire of our minds to be what God wants us to be in fact the word sober is used five times in the book of Titus notice in your Bibles in Titus chapter one verse eight that a bishop is to be a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober minded notice chapter two in verse two that aged men be sober minded verse four that they may teach the young women to be sober minded verse six young men likewise exhort to be sober minded what's he talking about he's saying that Christians ought to have a seriousness about themselves and about their place in God's plan for this world that there ought not to be as it relates to the things of God a frivolous attitude an attitude that it doesn't matter but that we need to be sober minded people taking into consideration the world in which we live that Christ has come and that he is coming and because of that have a serious intensity about our job in this world as Christians secondly he says we're to live righteously that has to do with our dealings with other people because Christ has come and because he is coming my relationship with other people is to be above our approach in my dealings with God's people and with the people of the world I am to live a righteous life thirdly he says I am to live godly I am to be disciplined in my relationship with God if before I was a Christian I was ungodly
[time=2983] now as a Christian I am to be godly that means that I am to spend time cultivating my life as it is patterned after the life of God that's discipline discipline in sober mindedness discipline in righteous living discipline in godliness once again may I point out to you that you don't become godly by reading a book or listening to a tape or going to a seminar or watching a television program or going to church you don't become godly in any of those ways you become godly by spending time with god in a disciplined way opening his word and spending time in his word and in prayer taking time to be holy it takes discipline to be godly it's interesting to me that the word teaching in verse 12 is a word which means discipling or discipline discipling us to be godly that is what the bible is all about to make us godly creatures so if we'll review because Christ has come because he is coming I am first of all to be denouncing certain things in my life saying no to them secondly I'm to be disciplining myself to be serious minded to be righteous in my dealings with people and to be godly in my relationship with the father in heaven last but not least he says I am to be a dedicated person to the work of god the bible says that the purpose for which we have been purchased is that we might be zealous of good works we are so prone as grace believing Christians to say that because we have not been saved by good works that good works have no place in our lives but the bible is very clear that after becoming a Christian by grace we are to be committed to good works as Christians that's what Titus is all about that's what it means in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10 when it says we have been ordained to good works in our salvation and paul writing to Titus says because Christ has come and because he is coming you need to be dedicated zealous intense committed to good works in giving and serving and loving and praying and studying and teaching whatever your gift might be there ought to be a zealousness about it why because Christ came and he appeared in grace and because he is coming to appear in glory that demands that you be a certain kind of a person in this present age in the in between fella was out according to dl moody in the field one day and someone who was a wayfaring man passed by to give a witness to him and he asked him if he was all right spiritually and he said oh yes I've been saved and I live each day by my good looks the wayfaring evangelists said that though he talked to many people in his lifetime nobody had ever given him that answer before and he was mystified he said with some risk could you explain that to me he said well yes I can he said you know several years ago I went to hear a preacher and he preached on Isaiah 45 22 look unto me all the ends of the earth for I am God and there is none else and he said I looked and I saw Christ on the cross in my mind's eye and I embraced the doctor of salvation and and I see the Lord dying for me and I've looked to the Lord and I've been saved. I said later I went back to hear that same preacher preach and he opened his bible to Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 2 and he said looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and to use that passage to encourage me that in my Christian life I could look to the Lord as the example and leader of my life and could know that he was walking ahead of me and I could find strength to live the Christian life and so he said in my mind's eye I see the Lord Jesus walking out in front of me as the author and finisher of my faith and I look unto him he said then one day later I went to hear that same preacher preach and he opened the text to Titus chapter 2 and verse 13 and he said looking for that blessed hope and the glorious epiphany of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ and he said in my mind's eye I look yonder to the future and I see the Lord Jesus coming back in all of his glory surrounded by the angels and with the saints who have been redeemed to set up his kingdom on this earth and when I see that in my mind's eye it causes me to want to live in such a way as to be ready when he comes and so he said you see I was saved by my good looks I looked at the cross and then I looked at the Savior as my leader and my author and then I look at him coming back and when I see him it makes me to be a kind of person I would not be otherwise many women I believe that the incarnation of Christ is coming at Bethlehem and ultimately to die upon the cross and is coming again in glory are the greatest incentives to good works and proper living in our lives that you'll find any place in the Word of God and that is why it is such a wonderful and holy and exciting time when we gather as a church family around the Lord's table and we read those precious words that say we do show the Lord's death the first epiphany till he come the second epiphany and we commit ourselves anew to living lives that will be glorifying to him do you know the Lord who came the first time are you looking for his coming the second time if you have those two epiphanies in your mind and in your heart you will be a kind of person that the world will take notice of for you'll be different shall we pray before we close our prayer if you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior you can trust him now he came into this world to demonstrate the grace of God and he loves you with an everlasting love he cares about you he wants to bring you to his heaven someday and he'll do that if you'll confess your sin and put your trust in him right now if you're watching by television you can do that right where you are simply invite Jesus Christ into your life ask for forgiveness of your sin and accept him as your Savior in the simplicity of your own way you can do that if you'll put your trust in Christ today and our Father we pray that wherever this message is gone forth men and women will hear and embrace its truth thank you father for caring enough for us to come into this world to love us enough to make your grace relevant to us thank you father for your appearing in the future which we have not experienced but which we know to be true as if it had already happened you've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah if as a result of this program you have made a decision about your relationship to Jesus Christ we want to send you some helpful material please write to pastor David Jeremiah Box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and when you write please let us know the nature of your decision we are anxious to know how the Bible hour has ministered in your life earlier on today's program Pastor Jeremiah shared with you the urgent need that is now facing the Bible hour you can help today with your prayers and financial support would you consider sending a special Christmas gift to the Bible hour in honor of the birthday of Jesus in appreciation of your special gift to fifteen dollars or more we would like to send you a copy of the new King James Bible new testament please send your gift to pastor David Jeremiah Box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 pastor also offered to send you a free copy of the daily walk we know you will find this daily devotional guide book to be a great help in your own spiritual life please write today and ask for your free copy and when you write please mention the name of the station you are watching once again our address is Pastor David Jeremiah Box 15250 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 speaking for pastor David Jeremiah this is Jack Gray inviting you to join us next week at the same time for the Sunday morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church the Bible hour has been made possible by members of the Founders Club the Founders Club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach ministry
