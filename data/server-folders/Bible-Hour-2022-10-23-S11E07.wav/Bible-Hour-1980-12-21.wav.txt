[time=14] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=24] [MUSIC]
[time=34] >> Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=36] >> And we're so happy to welcome you to this service
[time=44] of worship in this Christmas season.
[time=47] Here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, this is Christmas Sunday.
[time=52] And many of you who are watching our telecast on a delayed basis in other places today for the very first time in the town of Altoona, Pennsylvania, we welcome you to the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour and the television ministry that we hope will be a real blessing to you all.
[time=69] It is a wonderful time of the year to sing praises unto the Lord.
[time=74] Here during these past days, we have been celebrating our Lord's birth by sharing the news of it as widely as possible through our presentation of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=86] We have presented 10 concerts.
[time=89] We have two more to go this evening.
[time=91] And we are just delighted at the response of this whole area to the presentation of the gospel in such a unique way.
[time=99] And we're grateful that today on our telecast, we can have a different Living Christmas Tree choir who are the future of the Living Christmas Tree choirs.
[time=110] They are our young people.
[time=112] And every year, they sing as a part of the Christmas season.
[time=116] And they're going to present some music to us now.
[time=118] They are under the direction of our youth coordinator, Mr. Craig Pearson.
[time=122] And I know that you will be richly blessed as they share in their way, in their music, the wonderful story of Christ's birth.
[time=136] [MUSIC]
[time=146] >> Little Jesus, we've been in a manger, little Jesus, we've been on the day.
[time=160] Little Jesus, very special, baby, born of Mary on this holy day.
[time=172] >> Lift your regal home above, just because you cared.
[time=179] You made yourself into a man, your godly love you shared.
[time=186] Yes, you lived a perfect way, knew the awful price you paid.
[time=193] Little baby Jesus, coming back some day.
[time=199] >> Little Jesus, we've been in a manger, little Jesus, we've been on the day.
[time=214] Little Jesus, very special, baby, born of Mary on this holy day.
[time=227] >> Can it be you really died, gave your life for me?
[time=234] You suffered on that ugly cross, so that I'd be free.
[time=240] I'm glad you didn't have to stay.
[time=244] In that cold and lifeless grave, little baby Jesus, coming back some day.
[time=254] >> Little Jesus, we've been in a manger, little Jesus, we've been on the day.
[time=266] We've been on the day, Jesus, very special, baby, born of Mary on this holy day.
[time=282] >> Sleeping on the hey, on this holy day.
[time=288] >> Sleeping on the hey.
[time=292] >> She's coming back some day.
[time=299] You come coming back some day.
[time=310] [ Applause ]
[time=325] >> The big voice that was the solo is the young man by the name of Tim Norton.
[time=331] And we're so proud of him and our choir.
[time=333] And I want to take this opportunity to say congratulations to another group of young people,
[time=339] many of whom are up there.
[time=341] Last night, we played a public school over in Ohio, our Christian school, black old Christian school.
[time=349] And it is a milestone in the life of the athletic program of our school that they won their first game against a public school.
[time=356] They beat Ohio City 82 to 78.
[time=359] And we're so grateful for all of the people that are involved in that and had a part in it in our coach, Mr. Longbrake, and all of the young men who participated.
[time=367] And it thrills me to see many of those guys up there singing and proclaiming the message of the gospel in music.
[time=374] And they're going to sing again for us right now, a song that reminds us that wise men still seek him.
[time=382] [MUSIC - 306 seconds]
[time=696] [APPLAUSE]
[time=703] We're so glad you've joined us for this special television program and it's special because it's Christmas time.
[time=709] In many of the areas where our television program is seen, this is a little past Christmas, but it's still a very blessed time to share in the joys of the Christmas season.
[time=719] And Donna, we have some people who watch us and are part of what we do, who are so very special to us, and I know we were talking before the telecast of how important it is for us to express holiday wishes to them.
[time=731] Yes, it certainly is. Without them, we wouldn't be able to come into your home each week, and that is the people who make up our Founders Club.
[time=739] And they are people who on a regular basis contribute to the Bible Hour in order that we may stay on the air.
[time=745] And we want to say to you at this season a special thank you for all that you do each month to make it possible for us to continue this ministry.
[time=753] We've sent all of our Founders Club members a special Christmas greeting, and I hope that you received yours, and that you will use that greeting not only as an opportunity to receive from us our best Christmas wishes, but as a prayer reminder to pray for us and our family.
[time=768] We hope to have our family here one of these days soon, but we decided that the Christmas rush was just a little bit too much to try to get four children ready this early in the morning to come and share with you on television.
[time=779] So we'll wait until some of the pressures off and then we'll do that. Right now, we want to talk to you about a special booklet that we have prepared that we think will be of help to you, and we want you to take an opportunity to listen carefully.
[time=790] And if you don't have this book to be sure and order it, it's all about a subject that is very prevalent at this time of the season.
[time=797] It is almost out of context in many ways because it's a season of goodwill and peace on earth, and yet for many people, honey, it's a season where they hurt a lot.
[time=808] Yes, it is. I don't think there's any time of year where I receive more phone calls from people who are lonely and really hurting.
[time=815] And we have a booklet which we would like to send to you. It's called Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions for the Lonely from God's Word.
[time=824] And it's a collection of scripture verses straight from the Bible without any additions that deal with this problem. It gives you the Psalms that are appropriate, and it gives you some promises from God's Word, and then some prescriptions from God's Word of how to overcome this in your own life.
[time=841] And we'd be happy to send you a free copy of this booklet if you just call us at our toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=851] Just tell the Bible our operator that you would like your copy of Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions.
[time=857] Or if you prefer, you may write to us that our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=868] And Donna, while we're bringing greetings to everyone, there's a special group of people who have just joined the Bible Our Television Network in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
[time=876] We're so grateful to have you with us today. We hope that the Bible Our will be a blessing to you, to your family.
[time=882] And if you're watching from Altoona especially, we'd like to hear from you this week.
[time=886] It's always very important to us to hear from our friends in new areas where the television program is seen.
[time=891] So sit down and write us today and let us know that you're a part of the Bible Our Television Ministry, and we'll be so glad and encouraged that you did that.
[time=899] Once again, if you are calling for the booklet that Donna has shared with you, the telephone number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=905] It's a toll-free call from any place in the United States.
[time=909] And if you're writing to us, either to request the booklet or to communicate to us about the Ministry of the Bible Our, simply write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=921] We look forward to hearing from you this week. We counted a real privilege to extend the Ministry of the Bible Our into your home through printed literature that will help you grow in your faith.
[time=931] Now it's time to get back to our special service, candle lights, special Christmas music, the young people in the Christmas tree, and a special message from the Word of God.
[time=940] Before we go back to the service, once again Donna, why don't you express our love and greetings to our friends?
[time=946] We certainly want to wish each one of you a very Merry Christmas and we pray that you will have a very Christ-centered holiday.
[time=976] If the stars are bright and shining, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
[time=989] Long lay the world in sin and ever pining till He appeared, and the soul felt its worth.
[time=1004] A thrill of hope, though weary, well rejoices, for yonder breaks, a new and glorious word, fall on your knees.
[time=1025] For hear the aims and voices, for now divine, oh Lord, when Christ was born, for now divine, oh Lord.
[time=1054] In night, a night divine.
[time=1077] He taught us to a wonderful daughter, his lord, his love, and his gospel, his peace.
[time=1093] Change shall he break, for the slave is still our brother, and in his name, all oppression shall cease.
[time=1109] Sweet hymns of joy, made great, for chorus, praise me, let all within us, praise his holy name, fall on your knees.
[time=1129] For hear the angel voices, for now divine, oh Lord, when Christ was born, for now divine, oh Lord.
[time=1159] In night, a night divine.
[time=1189] We are so grateful for Keith Brodigan's ministry in music.
[time=1203] We learned just recently that Keith is going to be leaving us to attend school at IU and study music.
[time=1212] He sings in the living Christmas tree performance, as most of you know, and last Sunday night my sister, who was on the faculty at IU, who was here in attendance, I leaned over to her while he was singing, and I said to her, he's coming down to your place to study music.
[time=1227] And she said, I don't know what in the world we can teach him, that he doesn't already know.
[time=1232] Of course, I have to report she teaches in the athletic department, and that might make some difference.
[time=1238] We've been so worried about losing Keith's voice and not being able to hear him because we appreciate him so much, but I quit worrying about that this week, because I realize that he's going to be back often.
[time=1248] There is an attraction here that will bring him back here probably almost every week, so we'll just schedule him like always, and most of you know that that attraction is the young lady who's going to sing for us right now.
[time=1260] Her name is Starr, and she's going to minister to us in music.
[time=1265] [MUSIC]
[time=1280] What child is this, who lay to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping, who angels creep within them sweet, while shepherds watch are keeping.
[time=1309] This is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
[time=1323] [MUSIC]
[time=1352] So bring him incense, gold and urr, composite, king to own him.
[time=1367] King of King salvation brings, let loving hearts enthrone him.
[time=1381] Nail spear shall pierce him through the cross he bore for me for you.
[time=1395] Hail, hail the word made flesh, the babe the son of Mary.
[time=1417] The babe the son of Mary.
[time=1431] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1442] Thank you Starr for sharing that beautiful song of Christmas, and for all of our musicians and over 300 people involved in the cast of the living Christmas tree presentations.
[time=1453] We're so grateful for your commitment to the Lord, and we thank God for the blessing that he has showered upon us during these days as we've been telling the Christmas story.
[time=1463] We have two to go tonight, one at five o'clock and one at eight o'clock, and we're trusting for the Lord's blessing upon those presentations.
[time=1471] Thank all of you who have come to share as a part of the congregation each night.
[time=1476] We're grateful for everyone who's had a part in making this possible.
[time=1480] Now my subject today is the significance of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=1487] And I invite your attention once again to the Gospel according to Matthew and the first chapter, Matthew chapter one.
[time=1495] Please open your Bibles to the first chapter of Matthew.
[time=1500] And I'm reading today from the 18th verse of Matthew's Gospel.
[time=1506] Following your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1510] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way.
[time=1514] When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1521] Then Joseph, her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.
[time=1530] But while he thought on these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying, "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1544] And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins."
[time=1552] Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophets saying,
[time=1559] "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted is God with us."
[time=1571] Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bitten him, and took unto him his wife,
[time=1578] and knew her not, till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.
[time=1586] Shall we pray together?
[time=1588] God in heaven we bow down to worship at the throne of the virgin born Christ,
[time=1596] who came into this world to become the Savior of lost men and women, whose Savior is mine.
[time=1608] I pray, dear God, that as we unfold this teaching concerning his miraculous and supernatural birth,
[time=1615] that the Spirit of God will attend unto the message and bring it home to our hearts that it will bear fruit in each of our lives.
[time=1622] And if there be those who hear my voice today, who have not known Christ by way of faith,
[time=1629] that this will be a time when God's Spirit will speak to them as well, bringing home conviction of sin and of judgment and of righteousness, that they might come to know the Lord Jesus in a personal way in his name that I pray, amen.
[time=1647] An Orthodox Jew once asked a Christian Jew this question.
[time=1657] He said, "Suppose a son were born among us today, and it was said of him that he was born of a virgin.
[time=1668] What would you say?" And the Christian Jew thought for just a moment, and he said, "If he were such a son as Jesus, I would believe it."
[time=1683] The doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ better spoken of perhaps in accuracy as the virgin conception of Christ
[time=1691] is a doctrine which is not isolated alone by itself because it is something we have determined to believe,
[time=1698] to embellish the life and story of Christ, but it is the very crux of the doctrine of his life,
[time=1705] of his death, of his resurrection, of his present session in heaven.
[time=1710] What that Christian Jew answered in response to his question is very true.
[time=1717] It is the nature of Jesus Christ and his life and the evidence of the supernatural quality of his life
[time=1725] that makes the virgin birth so necessary and so important.
[time=1731] In his courteous homo Anselm reviewed in his writings four ways in which God can make a man.
[time=1743] He listed them as follows.
[time=1745] He said, "God can make a man by natural generation through the union of a man and a woman.
[time=1753] Children are born and God makes a man." Secondly, God can make a man without the agency of either a man or a woman.
[time=1762] He did that when he created Adam.
[time=1764] Thirdly, God can make a man without a woman.
[time=1769] When he took from Adam the ribs and created Eve, he did that without the agency of a woman.
[time=1777] Fourthly, God can create a man through the divine empowering of a man and a woman who are past the age
[time=1787] of bearing children, as he did with Abraham and Sarah.
[time=1792] And if these are all admitted, which we must admit if we are Bible-believing Christians,
[time=1798] if we believe the Word of God, then it should not surprise us that such a supernatural and miraculous birth
[time=1806] in fact, one step further than all of these that I have described would be the unique way in which God would bring his own son into the world.
[time=1816] Jesus, you see, was born of a woman without a man.
[time=1822] That he was begotten of the Holy Spirit is the testimony of the Word of God.
[time=1828] And when we speak of the virgin birth of Christ, what we mean is this, that Jesus Christ was uniquely begotten into this world, implanted divinely in the womb of the virgin Mary who knew not a man until Christ was brought forth.
[time=1845] He was begotten of God.
[time=1847] He was the son of God.
[time=1851] Now this has been not only the testimony and the record of the Word of God.
[time=1857] It is not only prophesied in the Old Testament, but accurately recorded in the New.
[time=1862] But men and women, it has been the testimony of the Christian church down through the ages beginning at the very earliest date of church history.
[time=1871] Immediately after the beginning of the apostolic church, after the close of the New Testament canon, men wrote of the virgin birth of Christ.
[time=1881] One such man was a man by the name of Ignatius, who lived in 100 A.D.
[time=1887] He writes in his Epistle to the Ephesians, which is not a canonical book, which is writing apart from the Scripture.
[time=1896] He wrote these words, "For our God, Jesus Christ was conceived in the womb of Mary by the Holy Spirit."
[time=1905] So writes Ignatius.
[time=1907] He wrote later in one of his writings, "Now the Virginity of Mary, and he who was born of her, are the mysteries most spoken of throughout the world."
[time=1919] Yet they are done in secret by God.
[time=1924] Ignatius was a student of John the Apostle.
[time=1927] He received his teaching from the hand of John.
[time=1931] It is interesting as you study church history to discover that it was the virgin birth of Christ, which was one of the cardinal doctrines which was continually attacked by the opponents of Christianity.
[time=1943] For instance, there was a man by the name of Serenthus, who was an enemy of the Apostle John.
[time=1949] He lived at the time when John lived and when he wrote.
[time=1953] And Serenthus always and consistently attacked the writings of Christianity.
[time=1958] He was especially vigilant in his attacks against the divinity of Jesus Christ.
[time=1965] So antagonistic was he toured the Christian faith that the record is told that one day John the Apostle was in the public bath.
[time=1975] And it was said that meeting Serenthus in that public bath he turned to all who were there and he cried out, "Let us flee, lest the bath fall in, while Serenthus the enemy of the truth is here."
[time=1991] And Serenthus the enemy of the truth was the one who championed the cause against the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2000] There was another post apostolic writer, a man by the name of Aristides, who lived in 125 AD.
[time=2009] Aristides speaks of the virgin birth in these ways.
[time=2012] He writes, "He is himself son of God on high, who was manifested of the Holy Spirit, came down from heaven, and being born of a Hebrew virgin he took on his flesh from the virgin.
[time=2026] He it is, who was according to the flesh born of the race of the Hebrews by the God-bearing Virgin Mary."
[time=2033] So wrote Aristides.
[time=2036] And later on in the early church days there was a man by the name of Justin Martyr, who lived at 150 AD.
[time=2044] Justin Martyr gives ample evidence to the concept of Jesus' miraculous birth.
[time=2049] He writes in one of his writings these words, "Our teacher, Jesus Christ, who is the first begotten of God the Father, was not born as the result of sexual relations.
[time=2062] The power of God descending upon the virgin overshadowed her, and caused her while still a virgin to conceive.
[time=2071] For by God's power he was conceived by a virgin, in accordance with the will of God Jesus Christ his son has been born of the Virgin Mary."
[time=2083] Now that is the testimony of those who wrote right at the very beginning of the early church and at the end of the apostolic era.
[time=2093] But men and women we do not depend for our information on a study of history.
[time=2101] For we have in this book the testimony of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2107] It is prophesied in the Old Testament it is accorded to scriptural impact in the New Testament and everywhere it is assumed in all of the writings.
[time=2120] For instance, the prophecy concerning Christ's coming is in the book of Genesis.
[time=2126] Did you know that?
[time=2127] Why you're not even out of the blocks in reading through the Bible before you come to the third chapter and the 15th verse.
[time=2133] And here is a very, very interesting presentation of the unique birth of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2141] Theologians call that passage the proto-evangelicum.
[time=2145] The beginning of the gospel or the beginning of the truth concerning the Saviorhood of Christ.
[time=2151] It is not always seen that way when we read it.
[time=2154] But listen carefully to its words, Genesis chapter 3 and verse 15.
[time=2159] Here God says, "The seed of woman shall crush the head of the serpent."
[time=2166] Thus the deliverer according to this passage.
[time=2170] The deliverer who would ultimately defeat Satan would be the seed of the woman.
[time=2177] Now that is not the normal natural way for you to describe someone born into the world.
[time=2183] It is to a man that seed is accorded.
[time=2186] But here we have the record of the seed of a woman.
[time=2189] It is a flag.
[time=2191] It is a point.
[time=2193] It is an arrow.
[time=2194] It is an underscoring to remind us that that one who is to be the deliverer, that one who is to defeat Satan, who is to crush Satan, is going to be a unique born one.
[time=2204] He is to be the seed of the woman, not the seed of man.
[time=2209] And I believe that it is that one of whom Isaiah the prophet writes when in his writing in the book of Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14.
[time=2220] He pens this prophecy.
[time=2222] It is a more clear prophecy than that indication which is found in Genesis 3.
[time=2228] He writes, "The virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel."
[time=2236] This is very specific in that the virgin is referred to.
[time=2243] The name most logically refers to the woman about whom the writer of Genesis speaks.
[time=2249] And you say to me, "Pastor Jeremiah, how in the world can you relate Isaiah 7, 14 to the birth of Jesus Christ?"
[time=2258] Why wasn't that prophet just speaking of some woman who would be born during his time, who would be assigned from the Lord?
[time=2266] It is interesting that the critics have pitched their tents of criticism right here at this point.
[time=2274] They have tried every way they can to destroy the prophecy of the virgin birth of Christ as it is recorded in Isaiah 7, 14.
[time=2284] But I do not rest upon my understanding of Old Testament prophecy for my conviction that it is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2292] For as it is so often true, the New Testament is the accurate commentary on the Old Testament.
[time=2298] How do I know that Isaiah is speaking of Christ? Why? The New Testament tells me so.
[time=2304] The writer who records for us what we have read in the book of Matthew says, what Isaiah said is what is happening right now in the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2315] Notice in your Bibles in the first chapter, verse 22 of Matthew, Now all this was done. Listen now, all of it was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet saying,
[time=2330] and then verse 23 is a quotation of Isaiah 7, 14, "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
[time=2338] and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted as God with us." How do I know that Isaiah was speaking that this was assigned to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ?
[time=2349] Why Matthew's gospel tells me so, and I believe it, and I accept it, and I accept it literally true.
[time=2358] The critics don't believe it because they don't believe the Bible, and yet those who have studied this Old Testament prophecy
[time=2366] remind us that the word that is used in the prophecy for virgin occurs only six other times in the Bible.
[time=2374] Although its exact meaning has been debated, its usage is always consistent with the meaning of the term virgin,
[time=2382] and in some cases this is the only possible meaning.
[time=2386] Now listen, the scholars who took the Old Testament and translated it into the Greek Septuagint version,
[time=2393] what word did they use? Why they used the standard Greek word for virgin in a translation of Isaiah 7, 14?
[time=2402] So did Matthew when he quoted that from the Old Testament.
[time=2405] When he had to rewrite Isaiah's prophecy in his writing, what word did he use to write the word virgin?
[time=2412] Why he used the Greek word, that means virgin, that means a woman who has not known a man sexually.
[time=2418] And so the battleground is useless, you cannot deny it unless you deny the literal interpretation of the word of God.
[time=2426] Not too long ago, locally I was on a television talk show with another pastor.
[time=2431] And I made the statement on that program that I believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible.
[time=2436] The next week into my office came an epistle, a long writing from someone who lives in this area,
[time=2447] who had heard me make that statement, and he had written me a letter almost as long as the New Testament,
[time=2453] and in that letter he had documented all of the things that he said were a contradiction of the literal interpretation
[time=2460] of the New Testament. Never in my life have I read so much nonsense in one paragraph.
[time=2467] It was filled with misspelled words, wrong interpretations, verses out of context,
[time=2473] and I thought to myself as I read that, I don't believe I could live long enough to gain enough faith to believe that.
[time=2480] It takes more faith to believe what the critics write than it does to believe the word of God.
[time=2485] And I just accept the word of God as literally true because it has been studied by scholars far greater than myself,
[time=2492] but most of all because of the spirit of God witnesses within me that it is the truth.
[time=2497] And Isaiah said it, and Matthew confirmed it, and so the doctrine of the virgin birth is settled for eternity.
[time=2506] Now in Matthew's Gospel we have an illustration, most interesting, most accurate.
[time=2514] It is an illustration of how even in one letter, in one chapter, the doctrine of the virgin birth has been wonderfully protected.
[time=2524] I have in my Bible taken a pen and made some little stars next to the verses or the phrases that underscore
[time=2533] and protect the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ.
[time=2536] Let me point them out to you if you mark in your Bible you may have already marked them.
[time=2541] But notice just in the first chapter of Matthew we're talking now about the protection of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ.
[time=2549] In verse 18 Mary was espoused to Joseph, here's the first one, before they came together.
[time=2556] She was found with child, here's the second one, of the Holy Spirit. Notice verse 20.
[time=2562] Fear not to take unto the Mary thy wife, here's the third one, or fourth one, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2571] Verse 23, behold the virgin shall be with child, and he shall be called Immanuel.
[time=2578] What is Immanuel? It is God with us.
[time=2581] And verse 25, almost like a postscript, but just again to underscore this great doctrine, here's what it says,
[time=2589] and Joseph knew not Mary till she had brought forth her firstborn son.
[time=2594] And the word no there is the word for sexual union.
[time=2597] It means that they did not have sexual relationships until Jesus Christ was born in order to protect the absolute certainty that he was the virgin born son.
[time=2608] And all of that just here in one chapter, and in the first chapter of Luke and the 34th verse and following, we have the same kind of evidence.
[time=2617] The evidence for the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2621] I have in my library a book written by a man named Harry Rimmer.
[time=2626] He has written some wonderful things for Christian students.
[time=2629] And that book entitled "The Magnificence of Jesus" deals a bit with the virgin birth of Christ.
[time=2636] In it he tells a most interesting story about being called to an ordination council on an occasion to examine a young man who was studying for the ministry and preparing to serve in a parish.
[time=2648] During the examination they examined him on his belief concerning the virgin birth of Christ, which by the way is one of the cardinal doctrines that are always to be examined anytime anybody goes into the ministry because if they're wrong there, they're wrong a lot of places.
[time=2664] And they asked this young man, do you believe in the virgin birth?
[time=2667] And he said, no, I don't believe in it.
[time=2670] And Dr. Rimmer said, why don't you believe in it?
[time=2676] He said, the reason I don't believe in it is because it's only found on two pages of the New Testament writings.
[time=2683] Only twice, only found recorded twice.
[time=2687] Paul never mentions it, he said.
[time=2689] Peter never mentions it.
[time=2691] Christ was totally ignorant about it.
[time=2693] He never mentions it.
[time=2696] "Well," said Dr. Rimmer, "tell me, what do you preach?" He said, I preach.
[time=2703] I preach the sermon on the mount.
[time=2707] "Not me," said Dr. Rimmer.
[time=2710] "Why?" said the young man.
[time=2712] "Why?" he said, I don't believe it.
[time=2714] He said, you don't believe in the sermon on the mount?
[time=2717] No, sir, he said, I don't.
[time=2725] Can you imagine the idiocy of trying to decide whether you will believe a doctrine of the word of God based upon how much actual space it is given in the print?
[time=2736] And yet it is an illustration of the length to which critics will go when they have determined in their heart, I don't want to believe it.
[time=2746] If you determine in your heart that you will not accept Christ as a miraculous one, as a supernatural one, you have got to do something with the virgin birth.
[time=2757] You've got to do something with it, and most critics have just decided they won't believe it, whether that seems rational or not.
[time=2767] Well, the virgin birth of Christ, why is it important?
[time=2774] Just so that we can say it's a part of our creed to give us a doctrinal message for the Christmas season?
[time=2781] Oh, no.
[time=2782] Men and women, the virgin birth of Christ is critical to all that we understand about Jesus Christ and his person.
[time=2791] For instance, if you do not believe in the virgin birth of Christ, how do you explain his preexistence?
[time=2801] I hope there are none who listen to my voice today who are under the assumption that Jesus Christ began at Bethlehem.
[time=2808] Oh, he was born there. He was born into the world of humanity there, but he did not begin there.
[time=2815] John 8, verse 58, records his words when he said, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[time=2823] Jesus Christ existed in eternity past.
[time=2826] As far back as there has been time, he lived, and before time was created, he was.
[time=2832] There never has been a time when he wasn't, and there never will be a time when he ceases to be.
[time=2837] He is a part of the eternal Godhead. He has always been here.
[time=2843] And yet, the Bible says he was born into this world.
[time=2850] Western minds do not accept reincarnation.
[time=2855] If Jesus Christ existed before his birth, then his birth must needs be supernatural and miraculous.
[time=2864] It must be unlike anything that's ever happened before.
[time=2868] It must have taken the sovereign hand of God to supernintendent and make it happen.
[time=2873] It was God involved in his birth. It was a miracle, a supernatural miracle.
[time=2880] If you don't believe that, then you have to wipe out in your doctrinal theology, the preexistence of Christ.
[time=2887] There's no way to explain it.
[time=2890] Secondly, and perhaps more practically, if you do not believe in the virgin birth of Christ,
[time=2897] you've got to deal with the whole doctrine of Scripture.
[time=2903] For you see, the Bible says that's the way it happened.
[time=2907] The Bible says, in Genesis, in Isaiah, in Luke, in Matthew, the Bible says he was born of a virgin.
[time=2917] And if you have decided that in your mind you cannot fathom that and comprehend it and you don't believe it,
[time=2925] then what right have you to believe anything the Bible says?
[time=2929] Who decides what you believe and what you don't believe?
[time=2932] Who says this part's true, that part's not?
[time=2937] You don't have the option of accepting one doctrine and rejecting the other.
[time=2941] If the Bible says he was virgin born and it carefully documents it, then your whole concept of Scripture rests upon whether or not you believe that to be true.
[time=2952] And it's interesting men and women that the preachers who don't believe the virgin birth
[time=2958] do not believe in the literal interpretation of the Scripture.
[time=2962] They can't. It's impossible for them to.
[time=2966] The writers who write against the virgin birth do not believe in the historical Jesus.
[time=2972] They can't. It's impossible for them to.
[time=2976] So the whole concept of Scripture comes down upon this passage.
[time=2981] But thirdly, let me remind you, and these are just a few illustrative points,
[time=2987] that your doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ is critical to the whole concept of salvation.
[time=2996] W. H. Griffith Thomas has written a book entitled Christianity is Christ,
[time=3002] and in his book he makes the statement he says, "The chief support for the doctrine of the virgin birth, listen now,
[time=3012] is the necessity of accounting for the uniqueness of the life of Jesus."
[time=3018] And Henry Morris, who also has written of Christ and has studied this doctrine, goes on to write in one of his books these words, listen to every word.
[time=3028] It is altogether fitting that the one who performed many miracles during his life, who offered himself on the cross as the atoning sacrifice for the sins of men,
[time=3039] and who then rose bodily from the dead in vindication of all of his claims.
[time=3045] It is mandatory that this one should have begun such a unique life
[time=3051] by a unique entrance into life.
[time=3054] If he is truly our Savior, he must be far more than a mere man.
[time=3060] Though also he was truly the son of man.
[time=3063] To die for our sins, he must himself be free from any sin of his own.
[time=3069] To be sinless in practice, he must be first sinless in nature.
[time=3075] He could not have inherited a human nature from an earthly father, or he would have been bound under the curse and the bondage of sin, as are all other sons of men.
[time=3088] His birth, therefore, must have been a miraculous birth.
[time=3093] The seed of the woman was implanted in the virgin's womb when, as the angel said, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
[time=3104] and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee.
[time=3110] Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of the shall be called,
[time=3116] the Son of God, the Son of God, the Son of the Father,
[time=3124] not the Son of human parentage, but the Son of the Father.
[time=3130] In the Old Testament Scriptures, the sacrificial system, which is so much a part of the Old Testament law, consistently held up the necessity of a lamb without spot and without blemish.
[time=3142] And men and women, Jesus Christ, came into this world as the sinlessly perfect son of God.
[time=3150] Without spot, without blemish, he went to the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sin.
[time=3158] And that could not have happened had his birth not been so miraculously ordained of God.
[time=3165] He was virgin born.
[time=3169] May I say to you that one of the last reasons why the virgin birth is critical to you and to me
[time=3177] is because of his present work on our behalf.
[time=3183] I have a friend by the name of Wendell Kimpton who is the president of the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=3190] This past week, his 45-year-old wife had an aneurysm and a cerebral hemorrhage
[time=3198] and yesterday she went home to be with the Lord.
[time=3202] I'm going to the funeral this week in Philadelphia.
[time=3205] And I already know what I'll find when I get there.
[time=3208] I'll find a kind of sorrow which is unlike the sorrow of the world.
[time=3214] And I will see in Wendell the hurt of having lost his partner, but the underneath strength
[time=3221] that comes from knowing a personal God and having been much in fellowship with him during these days.
[time=3229] And I know that that will be because the God whom Wendell serves is the God whom I serve.
[time=3235] And the Christ who is the mediator between God and man is the virgin born Christ,
[time=3241] who is at one and the same time 100% God and 100% man.
[time=3249] And who in times of need like that is capable in our behalf of reaching one hand up to the Father,
[time=3257] for he is the Son of the Father, and reaching another hand down to a hurting man because he is the Son of Man.
[time=3265] And in a unique and wonderful way bringing the two together so that they might find help in the time of need.
[time=3273] Because he is the Son of Man he knows the infirmities that I have and the needs in my nature.
[time=3281] And because he is the Son of God he can do something about it.
[time=3286] Men and women he is the virgin born Son of God.
[time=3292] And he is my Savior. Is he yours?
[time=3296] Have you accepted his plan of salvation for your sin?
[time=3300] Have you received him into your heart and asked him to be your Savior?
[time=3304] He came into this world to go to the cross and die for you and he wants to be your Savior and he will be if you will let him.
[time=3312] Shall we pray?
[time=3315] In these closing moments just before we leave the air I want to take a moment at this Christmas season to speak to you.
[time=3325] And I want to ask you do you know Jesus Christ as your Savior?
[time=3330] Have you put your trust in him?
[time=3332] Have you asked him to come into your life and be your Savior?
[time=3335] Forgive your sin.
[time=3337] Have you accepted his death, burial and resurrection for you?
[time=3343] In this glad Christmas season you can do that by simply praying oh God I know that you sent Jesus for me and I accept what he did on the cross as full payment for my sin.
[time=3354] And I put my faith and trust in him and receive him into my life.
[time=3358] Right where you are wherever that might be you can do that today if you will.
[time=3365] Shall we pray? Oh God in heaven many who have heard this message do not know you.
