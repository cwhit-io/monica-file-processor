[time=27] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=37] [MUSIC]
[time=51] >> Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=57] We are still celebrating Christmas here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=63] and for all of those of you who have joined us by way of television, we have just finished the living Christmas tree concerts which we do here each year.
[time=72] This year we had the privilege of sharing the living Christmas tree seven times
[time=78] in these past few days and just recently I got a report from our office that 10,081 people came to those concerts.
[time=86] What a tremendous opportunity God has given us to tell the message of Christmas and the true meaning of Christmas in the person of Christ through the medium of the living Christmas tree.
[time=96] On the Sunday after the living Christmas tree concerts over these past three years, we have had the opportunity of sharing the music of Christmas from our teen choir.
[time=106] And today we're going to listen to the music of our young people as they sing their kind
[time=113] of music that presents the Christmas story in their way.
[time=116] And the teen choir is under the direction of Mr. Craig Pearson, our Minister of Youth,
[time=122] as Mr. Rick Hawks, he's been very involved in coordinating this and all of it has been helped and encouraged by our Minister of Music, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=129] I trust that you will listen and enjoy the music of Christmas from the young people
[time=135] as they sing for us right now.
[time=141] [MUSIC]
[time=153] >> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying, "We saw His star in the east and we've come to worship Him."

[time=223] [MUSIC]
[time=232] [ Singing ]
[time=568] We enjoyed the ministry of our young people as they've sung in the living Christmas tree this morning.
[time=572] They certainly have had a good time doing it and we look forward to their concert of Christmas every year.
[time=578] We're grateful that you're with us today.
[time=580] Normally at this particular time, my wife Donna would be with me.
[time=584] But we got an early Christmas present this year.
[time=586] Our son David, who is nine years old, has the chicken pox.
[time=592] So they're home together today recovering from that interesting invasion of our home.
[time=598] I'll take this opportunity to say hello to David and encourage him to get well quickly.
[time=602] During these past days, we've had a tremendous opportunity to review what God has been doing through the Bible Hour television ministry.
[time=608] And one of the thoughts that has come to my mind as I've reviewed the mail and talked with individuals is the fact that so often the Bible Hour invades a person's life just at the time when, if it were not there, some grave circumstances would result.
[time=624] Not too long ago, we got a letter from one of our viewers in the Chicago area and she wrote that her family had broken up.
[time=634] She and her husband had separated and she had been away from God and away from her family, away from her husband.
[time=640] And God spoke to her heart and she said she knew beyond any shadow of doubt that she was to go home.
[time=646] And it was with some reluctance that she obeyed and she went back home.
[time=650] And that's where I pick up in the letter that she wrote me. She said, "The night I left, I prayed and asked the Lord what I should do."
[time=656] And he said, "Go back to your husband." Well, imagine what went through my mind then in spite of my thoughts.
[time=662] And I was obedient to the Lord.
[time=664] Here's where you come in, Pastor Day.
[time=666] I got home at 1130 just in time to see my husband watching you talk on the subject of what you sow you reap.
[time=674] Everything you said hit us exactly. We both gave it another try, praise God for the perfect timing and for using you to mend our marriage.
[time=682] The Lord has changed both our hearts and we are as happy or happier than when we first met.
[time=690] Now, I know that's just one incident among many, but it illustrates the fact that when the Bible hour is available to people where they are,
[time=698] God can use it in His perfect plan to bring them to a place of repentance and in this particular situation, the mending of a home.
[time=706] The reason that we're so excited about this ministry is because we believe that what I've just read to you is multiplied hundreds of times over every week as this program goes into the homes of people all over this area.
[time=718] And that's why we want to encourage you to be a part of what God is doing through the Bible hour ministry.
[time=724] Just through the last few days, we have written to many of you and encouraged you to make a special year-end gift toward the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=732] As you receive this program in your homes, there were you watch.
[time=738] It is only possible for us to minister to you because other people have given and have given sacrificially that the Bible hour television program might be seen.
[time=748] I'm going to ask that you sit down today and pray about making a special year-end gift to the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=754] Make it as large as you can and send it to us at the Bible hour office.
[time=760] Send it to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=766] Your gift will be used in its entirety for the television ministry.
[time=770] And for those of you who can send a gift of at least $15, we want to send you a special edition of the new King James Bible, the New Testament.
[time=778] This Bible is one of the finest translations of the original manuscripts and comes into your home as a gift from us because you care enough to be involved with us in the Bible hour ministry.
[time=788] I hope you will take time today to sit down and write to us and enclose a gift for the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=796] I say this with all sincerity, we need your help at this time of the year.
[time=800] It has been our purpose over this past year to recover the deficit that we got into at the end of 1978 as we went into major expansion.
[time=810] We just really need your help now if we're going to achieve that objective.
[time=812] While you're thinking of the ending of the old year and the beginning of the new, let me encourage you to join with many hundreds of people who are part of the Bible hour family in reading through the Bible in 1980.
[time=824] The read through the Bible program is known as The Daily Walk and it's a dynamic little booklet that helps you to get into the Word of God every single day and ultimately in one year's period of time to read the entire scriptures through.
[time=838] Many folks have done that in the past with great blessing and we'd like to encourage you to do it with us this year.
[time=844] For instance, each day that you read, there is an assignment of scripture, a portion that encourages you to get into the Word and then some application of that to your own life.
[time=854] If you will write to us this week, we'll be happy to send you the January edition of The Daily Walk so that you can get started in reading the Bible with us.
[time=862] We'll send you the January edition absolutely free and help you to understand how you can get your edition of The Daily Walk each and every month.
[time=872] We thank you so much for being a part of the total ministry of the Bible hour which extends beyond these hours that we spend together each Sunday.
[time=880] Now before we go back to the morning service, we want to honor today a sponsor who has been instrumental in helping us get the Word of the Gospel out on this particular Sunday.
[time=890] Today's sponsor is Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Fairchild in honor of Cleo M. Imhoff.
[time=898] And they have sponsored the Bible hour as a full sponsor today so that we might preach the Gospel on this particular Sunday in honor of their friend.
[time=906] And we thank you for your part in today's ministry.
[time=910] They'll be receiving a beautiful plaque in just a few days that shows that they were involved in the Bible hour ministry in a significant way on this Sunday.
[time=918] Once again, let me remind you before we go back to the morning service that if you are interested in helping with the Bible hour ministry through a special gift at this time or if you would like to have your copy of The Daily Walk.
[time=930] If you will write to us, we'll be happy to minister back to you through the mail.
[time=936] The address once again is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=944] Now in just a few moments, we're going to open the scriptures to the Old Testament book of Isaiah and the great prophecy of the coming of Christ in Isaiah 9-6 as we speak on the subject when love came down.
[time=956] I hope you'll join us with your Bibles open as we study the Word of God together.
[time=970] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=974] The Word of God says the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way.
[time=984] When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
[time=992] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately.
[time=1000] But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying,
[time=1008] Joseph thou son of David, fear not to take unto the Mary thy wife.
[time=1014] For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1020] And she shall bring forth the Son, and thou shall call his name Jesus.
[time=1028] For he shall save his people from their sins.
[time=1032] Jesus, the wonderful name of Jesus.
[time=1042] And angel appeared unto Mary, for favor with God she had found.
[time=1062] He told her that she'd be the mother.
[time=1074] Jesus, the Savior of man.
[time=1082] Although she was fragile and fearful, that people would not understand.
[time=1102] She realized that she was a servant.
[time=1114] But feeling God's wonderful plan.
[time=1136] The world if the name of Jesus, the world if the name of Jesus.
[time=1156] The name that can quiet the wildest fear.
[time=1166] The name that the saddest heart can cheer.
[time=1176] The wonderful name of Jesus.
[time=1216] An angel appeared unto Joseph.
[time=1234] Appeared unto him in a dream.
[time=1244] He told him that Mary would mother Christ Jesus.
[time=1256] The Savior of man.
[time=1264] Although he was frightened and fearful, that people would not understand.
[time=1286] He was a servant.
[time=1296] Though feeling God's wonderful plan.
[time=1318] The wonderful name of Jesus.
[time=1338] The name that the wildest heart can call.
[time=1358] The wonderful name of Jesus.
[time=1464] He is one of the leaders who God has used in the days gone by in a great measure here.
[time=1476] We have already had the privilege of doing that because two of his daughters were in the living Christmas tree choir.
[time=1484] He has been able to worship with us in a very special way today.
[time=1488] The song that the song that is the favorite of ours, if we had to vote on the favorites of the Christmas hymns,
[time=1500] I am certain that Silent Night would be very close to the top.
[time=1504] Please listen as she shares that with us right before the message today.
[time=1508] [MUSIC]
[time=1528] Silent Night, Holy Night, all is calm, all is bright, brown, young virgin, mother and child.
[time=1558] Holy infant, so tender and mild, sleep in heavenly peace.
[time=1578] Silent Night, Holy Night, Son of God.
[time=1606] Love's pure light, radiant beings from thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace.
[time=1630] Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.
[time=1654] Silent Night, Holy Night.
[time=1668] [MUSIC]
[time=1674] Thank you, Star. That was a very, very fine rendition of a very favorite Christmas hymn.
[time=1680] I want you to open your Bibles today to the ninth chapter of the book of Isaiah, Isaiah chapter nine.
[time=1692] While you're finding your place there, let me take this opportunity to express to all of you the very best of wishes for Christmas and for the new year.
[time=1702] Some of you, we will have an opportunity to say that to again, others we will not, for all of our friends who watch by television.
[time=1710] We trust that this will be a great season of the year for you.
[time=1712] We had some cards that went out from our office giving greetings to all of the folks of the church and friends from the Founders Club.
[time=1722] Some of you probably haven't gotten them yet, but they'll be there shortly.
[time=1726] Inadvertently, those cards were signed by just one member of the Jeremiah family and on the front is a picture of the whole family.
[time=1734] And I just want to tell you that the card is from everybody.
[time=1736] The pastor and his wife and all of the children, and we just want to let you know that we're thinking of you at this time of the year,
[time=1744] and those of you are part of our congregation, and we trust that this will be a wonderful season for all of you.
[time=1750] Shall we pray? Father, we pray that you will take a passage of Scripture that we have studied in the past, one that is familiar to us
[time=1760] for we have seen it upon the face of Christmas cards, even this last week, and refresh our hearts and our minds anew
[time=1768] with the realization of who it is that we honor at this season of the year, in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
[time=1776] Christmas is such an exciting time of the year, and for all of us who have children, it's especially meaningful,
[time=1786] they say some of the most wonderful things and respond in some of the most wonderful ways.
[time=1790] They come up with such wonderful surprises.
[time=1794] Last week, on Thursday, our nine-year-old surprised us with chickenpox, and so that's what we have at our house for Christmas.
[time=1802] But among other things, they are just a joy to be around because of all of the intrigue that seems to be a part of the season for them.
[time=1812] Sometimes they get very confused about the season.
[time=1816] Some time ago, I read about a little boy who was asking his mother some questions, and he said, "Is it true that Santa Claus brings us presents?"
[time=1824] And God forgiver, she said, "Yes, that's true." And he said, "And the stork brings us babies." She said, "Yes, that's right."
[time=1834] And the police department protects us. "Yes, that's true." He thought for a moment, and he said, "What do we need Daddy for?"
[time=1844] I read that and thought about it for a few moments, and I have come up with the answer.
[time=1850] What you need Daddy for is to put together all the presents that Santa puts under the tree.
[time=1856] Whether you forgive me for mentioning the round, wonderful one from the pulpit because we know better than that,
[time=1864] but those presents that are under the tree have to be put together.
[time=1868] And I have cautioned my wife this year in her shopping that I would deeply appreciate it if she could find things that were already assembled.
[time=1876] Because though that provides a wonderful Christmas for the children, it wipes out a whole week for the father.
[time=1882] I'm interested in how people respond to Christmas when all they have is the traditions that have grown up among us in our secular culture.
[time=1894] Sometimes counselors will tell you that people go through a tremendous problem after the holidays called the "After Christmas Blues."
[time=1904] I suppose even Christians are susceptible to some degree, but you know there's a reason for that.
[time=1910] If people only understand Christmas in terms of humanity, in terms of the secular things, you could get awful blue.
[time=1916] I think that must have been what happened when Irene Schwenfirth sat down with the night before Christmas and rewrote it
[time=1926] under the title of the night after Christmas. And by way of introduction, we listened to how she has rephrased the Christmas season.
[time=1936] She wrote 'Tis the night after Christmas, can't walk through the house. Things are so cluttered there's not room for a mouse.
[time=1944] Stockings and socks are all over the floor. Dad is exhausted in taking a snore. Children are asleep, but not in the right beds.
[time=1954] I have on my kerchief, oh my poor aching head. I can't get to the window. There's no place to walk.
[time=1960] The blackboard's in front of it. Whoops, I'm stepping on chalk.
[time=1964] The train's on the floor, also the track. Dad broke that, the very first crack.
[time=1970] Paper-intensive, pine needles too have covered the rug. I cannot wade through.
[time=1976] The deer moon outside peeps into this room, gives a vision of objects all needing the broom.
[time=1982] The cat and the pup are sprawled in low gear. Christmas has departed for another year.
[time=1988] All of us know what that's like, don't we?
[time=1990] And I thought as I read that very trite little piece of poetry, that in some way it sums up the emptiness that comes to the heart of a person who doesn't know anything more than what we've just talked about.
[time=2004] They've gone through the act of giving to their loved ones, they've spent their money, they've run up their charge cards, they've enjoyed all of the festivities and eaten and all of that.
[time=2014] Now it's time to take down the tree and put away everything.
[time=2018] Somehow even as Christians we know just a little bit of that feeling, but think what it would be like if you had nothing more enduring as a part of this holiday season than just the secular understanding of the time.
[time=2032] And you know one of the great things that we need to be reminded of, often as believers, is the fact that when Christmas day is over and all of the frivolity has been put aside, the person whose birthday we celebrate has an enduring quality that lives on day after day.
[time=2052] And it is possible for us to celebrate what Christmas is all about every day of the year, whether it's June or January.
[time=2060] Because Jesus lives and is alive in our hearts and He has come to dwell among us, He has brought love into our world.
[time=2068] He has love coming down in a human package to walk among men and to become to us all that we need to make our lives complete.
[time=2078] And so we have so much that we need to be thankful for at this season of the year.
[time=2084] As I stand here today in front of this beautiful Christmas tree that has been constructed for this season of the year, I want to talk to you about that package called love which God sent down to man.
[time=2096] It came down in one basic package. It came in the person of his son. But if you'll allow me a little freedom of imagination today in presenting this Christmas message, let me suggest to you that in this one package called Jesus Christ are many other packages which we can take out and open up and examine.
[time=2118] And every one of those packages is worthwhile understanding.
[time=2124] Long before Jesus walked upon this earth, Isaiah the prophet told us about those packages.
[time=2130] Packages wrapped up in one person, the Lord Jesus, when He wrote in the sixth verse of Isaiah chapter 9, these words.
[time=2138] For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful.
[time=2150] Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[time=2166] Christ's birth is a matter of history. Long before it occurred.
[time=2172] That sounds very strange to say and yet the Old Testament continually throughout its pages promises and prophesies that won by the name of Jesus was to be born into our world.
[time=2186] It not only gives the fact that he would be born but it gives to us by prophetic utterance many of the circumstances surrounding his birth.
[time=2194] Micah tells us that he was to be born in Bethlehem, the most unlikely place for the birth of a king.
[time=2202] Isaiah the prophet before the prophecy from which we have read today tells us that his mother was to be a virgin, Isaiah 714.
[time=2212] In the 60th chapter of the book of Isaiah and in the third verse we're told that his birth would be so significant that even the Gentiles would be attracted to his birth.
[time=2222] In the book of Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 15 we are told that it was to be an occasion of weeping over the slaughter of innocent children when Jesus was born.
[time=2232] And if you study the history of that time you know that that prophecy was literally fulfilled because of the wickedness of the Roman monarch.
[time=2242] Hosea chapter 11 verse 1 tells us that Jesus was to sojourn in Egypt when he was an infant and the record is clear that that took place.
[time=2252] Someone has said that there's so much prophecy of the coming of Christ in the Old Testament that even without the New Testament we could write the story of his birth accurately because we have the prophetic utterances from the prophets of old.
[time=2264] This prophecy which we have read from today is one of the best known and I believe it's best known because it captures in its words many of the aspects of the Savior who was born.
[time=2278] It is interesting to me that though these names wonderful counselor etc are in this passage not one time in all of the Bible do we see Jesus Christ actually being addressed by one of those names nor is he ever called in any way that I know of by the name wonderful or counselor so that it would be confused as a proper name.
[time=2300] No he is not referred to by these names because he is not all of these things because somebody called him that he is all of these characteristics because it is his very nature to be that way.
[time=2312] It is a part of his very being that he is wonderful counselor etc and it would take many more minutes than I can afford to know.
