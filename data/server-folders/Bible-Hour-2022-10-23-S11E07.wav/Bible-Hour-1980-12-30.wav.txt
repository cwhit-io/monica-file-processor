[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we
[time=45] present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerramon.
[time=60] "Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=74] We welcome our friends who have joined us now by way of television to the morning service of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=81] Just a few moments we'll be opening the Word of God to share together a message on the subject, getting ready to enter the decade of destiny.
[time=90] I trust that you'll have your Bibles ready and your hearts will be open to the ministry of the Word of God as we share together in just a few moments from the New Testament.
[time=100] Right now we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir and they're going to sing for us a song entitled "Let Us Sing a Song of Praise." "Let Us Sing a Song of Praise, Let Us Sing a Song of Praise, Let Us Sing a Song of
[time=124] Praise, Let Us Sing a Song of Praise, Let Us Sing a Song of Praise, Let Us Sing a song of praise, let us sing a song of praise.
[time=142] (orchestral music)
[time=172] (singing in foreign language)
[time=261] - Thank you, choir.
[time=263] A little over a year ago, we began a very special time in our church as we anticipated the expansion of our facilities.
[time=272] We are in the second service here, as you all know, because it's not possible any longer for us to extend our congregation into the one service that we've had in the past here in the Convocation Center, and so we're looking forward to the day when we'll be able to realize the blessings of the new facilities.
[time=291] Most of you are aware of the fact that we purchased a large tract of land in Arlington Park, and that the architects have been busily working on the development of facilities for us there.
[time=301] Our friends at home are going to have the opportunity to see what we have seen many times here, and that is the scale model which has been prepared.
[time=310] That model shows not only the building that we will meet in as a sanctuary, but it also shows the school center where our high school will be located.
[time=321] It shows the elementary section that will be built first so that we can house our elementary school children, and then some college buildings that will enable us to do some in-service training that we have a deep desire to get involved in.
[time=336] Most important, however, is the beautiful sanctuary that will make it possible for us to be back together again in one large family.
[time=344] We are so excited about this building, and we know that it's a great undertaking for us as a congregation.
[time=351] Many of you know that as a church, we have given and committed over $1 million in our giving above and beyond our regular ties and offerings over these next three years.
[time=362] A large portion of that money has already been received, and that sacrifice will make it possible for us very soon to be putting the shovel in the ground for these new buildings.
[time=372] Along with the giving that we have done, we entered into a large-scale capital fundraising program to raise additional monies for this very, very large project.
[time=383] And I know that many times we have been on the border of credibility even ourselves as we have thought about the gigantic task that God has given us to do.
[time=392] And I want to share some good news with you today that I know will be an encouragement to you.
[time=396] We've been working since September on the Capital Funds program, and this last week, we had the wonderful privilege of being seated at lunch with a godly couple who are not a part of this church but who have a great interest in what God is doing here and who believe in the work of God and want to invest their money and their effort in seeing that work go forward.
[time=420] And they made possible the first major gift to the new building when they gave to us a gift of $100,000.
[time=428] And we're rejoicing today on that gift.
[time=432] That's the beginning.
[time=434] I can remember when I thought that might be the end.
[time=437] But it's just the beginning of this project.
[time=439] And we know that God is going to allow them to be the leaders to encourage many others to give.
[time=445] What a thrill it is to know that even people who aren't a part of our congregation believes so strongly in what we're doing, that they want to have a part in seeing those buildings go up to the honor and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=456] Their gift will remain anonymous, but I say from the bottom of my heart what a tremendous blessing they have been to us by their investment in the ministry here.
[time=465] And I trust that God will richly bless them in this year as they continue to be stewards of His grace.
[time=471] I know that you're going to be thankful and pray with us that God will continue to see this project go forward and hopefully we'll have many other such announcements in the days ahead.
[time=480] Let me just remind you also that in light of their belief in us, how we ought to believe in ourselves and to do our part maintaining the commitments that we have made and making sure that our giving to together we build is all that it should be.
[time=495] If those on the outside feel as strongly about it, how ought we to feel ourselves.
[time=499] We have heard from the choir about how important it is that we praise God for His goodness.
[time=505] Please listen now to the ministry of Mr. Dave Miller as he comes to sing for us at this time.
[time=510] (upbeat music)
[time=522] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=731] - We're so very grateful for the privilege we have
[time=740] of coming into your homes each week with the Bible Hour.
[time=743] Don and myself have enjoyed the opportunity of talking with you during this segment of our telecast each week for many months now.
[time=751] And it's one of the opportunities that we look forward to each week because we feel we can do it on a more personal basis with our friends at home.
[time=759] It's been our privilege just recently to meet many of you for the first time through the Living Christmas Tree program and other special events here at Blackhawk.
[time=766] And now you seem so much more real to us as we talk with you in this informal setting.
[time=773] During these days, we've been trying to encourage our friends to get involved in reading the Bible through in 1980.
[time=779] It's still early enough for you to get started with that program and we have a special way of helping you do it through what we call the Daily Walk.
[time=787] Donna, we got one very exciting letter from one of our viewers who was involved in the Daily Walk Bible Reading program and I think the letter speaks for itself.
[time=796] - Yes, this lady writes and she says, "Dear Pastor Jeremiah, I wanted to let you know, "I am very thankful for your program and the Daily Walk.
[time=806] "Before I receive the Daily Walk, "I would read the Bible when I had time or was in need.
[time=811] "Now I find myself picking up the Bible to read "sometimes two or three times a day.
[time=817] "I feel an excitement inside." And that's just one of many letters that we received sharing from the people out there how much the Daily Walk is meant to them.
[time=827] - I think the exciting thing about the Daily Walk is the fact that it gives you something to do each day with a way to check against yourself so that you stay on target.
[time=837] I don't know how many people have told me that they've started out to read the Bible through in a given year and somehow along the way they get lost and they don't make it to the end.
[time=845] The Daily Walk is a chart that keeps you on target each day with a specific assignment, a place for you to check off the fact that you've done it.
[time=853] And of course along with that helpful information to make the Bible meaningful to you as you read it.
[time=858] An introduction, for instance, to each portion that you'll be reading and then a section of application that helps to make the Bible real in your own personal life.
[time=867] We believe the Daily Walk's a great tool for every Christian who wants to really know and understand the word of God.
[time=873] We'd love to send you the January issue of the Daily Walk so that you can get started along with the rest of us and reading through the Bible in 1980.
[time=882] Your first issue is absolutely free and we'd like to send it to you this week.
[time=886] When we send it to you, we'll let you know how you can get each and every month's issue of the Daily Walk.
[time=891] And Donna, you're so good at telling people how to get that information.
[time=894] So why don't you share that with them?
[time=897] If you would like to have your copy of the Daily Walk for January, you need to get your letter in the mail to us right away and write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15250 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=910] And that zip code is 46815.
[time=915] Donna, while we're talking to our friends at home, I don't want to miss the opportunity to express my appreciation to the many who have responded to our year end gift program.
[time=925] We've had so many letters from folks who have sent special year end gifts to the Bible hour and we're just grateful to you for your response to this ministry.
[time=933] I don't know if I can express adequately in the words that we have time to use in this brief time, how much that means to us at this time.
[time=942] You have kept the Bible hour alive during this season of the year by your giving.
[time=947] We still have a long way to go before we're substantially able to reach out to other areas.
[time=953] And of course, the ability that we have to do that is totally dependent upon your response to the ministry.
[time=959] If you've sent a gift and God is impressed upon your heart to give again, please do it as soon as you can.
[time=965] And if you didn't have an opportunity to give in the year end project, I hope you'll take the opportunity to sit down today and enclose a gift for us, large an amount as you can give to the Bible hour ministry so that we can keep on preaching the gospel to the many hundreds of people who share this program with us each week.
[time=983] For each of you who send a gift of at least $15, we want to send to you a very beautiful copy of the New Testament scriptures, the new King James Bible, which has just recently been translated and one of the very good editions of the scriptures.
[time=999] This New Testament red letter edition is your gift when you send a gift of at least $15 to the Bible hour television ministry.
[time=1006] And we'll be putting it in the mail to you this week when we receive your letter.
[time=1010] Now Donna, we have some folks who have been very involved in helping the Bible hour through what we call the sponsors program and I know you have some folks that you want to honor today on this program who are associate sponsors in helping the Bible hour go out of this particular Sunday.
[time=1027] - Yes, we have several folks today that we want to say a special thank you too for your willingness to support the Bible hour in a special way.
[time=1036] Janice Fisher, who is a Fort Wayne viewer.
[time=1040] Modella Yoder, also Fort Wayne.
[time=1044] Ray Hippensteel, Fort Wayne who views on channel 21.
[time=1049] And in South Bend, Indiana, Mrs. E. Hess.
[time=1053] And once again, we thank you folks so much for your willingness to support the Bible hour.
[time=1059] - Donna, the sponsors program goes on each week without much notice, but it is a very important part of what we're doing.
[time=1065] And if you'd like to know about the sponsors program and how you can get involved as a sponsor or an associate sponsor, if you'll drop us a note this week, we'll be happy to send you the information.
[time=1076] Please continue to pray for the Bible hour.
[time=1078] We're entering a new year in essence, a new decade.
[time=1081] And it's a very important time to us in the television ministry of our church.
[time=1085] We personally believe that God has put us into this ministry.
[time=1088] We didn't ask for it, it was brought to us and we were put into it by the hand of God and we're committed to the fact that God has His hand upon it and He's going to continue to guide and direct us as we reach out into the days ahead.
[time=1101] We need your help and we thank God for each one of you that stands with us in prayer and in support.
[time=1107] Now in just a few moments, I'm going to give a message that I trust will help us to get ready for these early days of 1980.
[time=1115] And I trust that you'll have your Bibles open to 1 Corinthians 15 as I share this very special message which God has laid upon my heart.
[time=1123] I'm getting ready for the decade of destiny and I trust that God will use it to encourage and motivate and strengthen your life as you share these moments with us today.
[time=1131] (gentle music)
[time=1183] (gentle music) - One of the great gospel songs
[time=1208] that has been blessing hearts for many, many years is a song that I suppose most of us heard the first time from the lips of George Beverly Shea.
[time=1219] He made I'd rather have Jesus live for many of us in the years past.
[time=1224] I know you're going to appreciate the rendition that Marilyn Wong has of I'd Rather Have Jesus.
[time=1228] (gentle music)
[time=1239] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=1254] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=1411] - Thank you, Marilyn, for reminding us of that great song.
[time=1428] Most of you know that the Living Christmas Tree program that we had the opportunity of sharing with our community went way over the expected number of people that we anticipated attending.
[time=1442] And the last time we were together for a praise service, I shared with you as a congregation that 10,081 people came this year to the Living Christmas Tree program.
[time=1452] What an opportunity it was for us to share the gospel in a meaningful way with many of our friends here in this city.
[time=1459] And we're grateful for the outreach that that is provided for us as a church.
[time=1464] Two of the young men who participated in that were very well received by our guests, their Keith and Blake.
[time=1474] And they probably are more like that famous duet team that travels all over the country, hail and wilder than anybody I've ever heard.
[time=1485] But they're ours, they belong to us.
[time=1487] They're members of this church.
[time=1488] And I had to explain to the numbers of folks that we didn't bring them from afar, pay them a great fee.
[time=1494] We pay everybody the same.
[time=1496] (audience laughing) And they just blessed our hearts with their music.
[time=1502] And I always enjoy having them sing before the message today.
[time=1506] Let's be challenged and stirred in our own hearts as we're reminded that it's time for men to rise up and stand for God.
[time=1514] (piano music)
[time=1524] [MUSIC] Christ of the men of God [MUSIC] Have gone with lesser things [MUSIC] Give one and nine and so [MUSIC] And strength will serve the King of kings [MUSIC] Christ of the men of God [MUSIC] His kingdom carries on [MUSIC] Bringing the day of brotherhood [MUSIC] And the night of God [MUSIC] Christ of the men of God [MUSIC] The church for you to pray [MUSIC] For strength will be called to harvest [MUSIC] Christ of the men make for great [MUSIC] If I have the voice of Christ [MUSIC] When his feet have drawn [MUSIC] Christ of the men [MUSIC] Christ of the men of God [MUSIC] Christ of the men of God ♪
[time=1639] And that's what it makes you feel like doing, isn't it?
[time=1642] When you hear that kind of a stirring challenge in music, rise up, oh, men of God.
[time=1647] Let's take our Bibles and turn together to the New Testament and the book of First Corinthians.
[time=1652] First Corinthians, chapter 15.
[time=1658] This is a very exciting time for me as a pastor, realizing that God has given to me and to all of us the wonderful privilege, not only of entering into a new year, but inaugurating a new decade.
[time=1673] We will be in just a few hours, leaving the 70s and moving into the 80s.
[time=1679] And I am a creature of special days and always find myself thinking inwardly, what does this particular time in my life and in the life of our church and just in general, what does it mean and what would God say to us at such a time as this?
[time=1696] And as I've studied the Word of God, I've asked God to give us a verse for 1980, just as he did for 1970.
[time=1703] My mind has turned again and again to a passage of Scripture which I believe summarizes what God would say to us that this particular crossroad in our lives and in the life of this church.
[time=1714] And that verse is clear at the end of the great resurrection chapter.
[time=1719] First Corinthians 15 and the 58th verse and with your Bibles open, why don't we read it together out loud?
[time=1726] First Corinthians 15, 58, and it would be a great encouragement to you if you would memorize this verse in these next few days.
[time=1734] First Corinthians 15, 58.
[time=1737] Let's read together.
[time=1739] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[time=1753] And now let us pray.
[time=1755] God in heaven, we believe this is a word for this hour to each of us.
[time=1760] We know that it has an historical setting and that it is the application of great doctrinal truth and Lord, we believe that we need to understand all of that so help us to be able to comprehend it.
[time=1772] Most of all, it has a practical admonition to each of our hearts and to all of us.
[time=1780] Many of us who need to hear the very important truths that are found in these words.
[time=1786] So help us to move away from the historical setting and into our own lives and apply this truth so that we will know not only what it means but what it means to us.
[time=1796] And we ask Lord in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior,
[time=1802] and by the power of the Holy Spirit that you will bless these moments together in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1809] The Apostle Paul is one of the greatest teachers
[time=1815] whose words have ever been recorded.
[time=1817] His treatise in the book of Romans is considered even by secular people to be one of the most logical progressions of thought ever written down.
[time=1828] We can learn much by studying his methods and reading his letters and seeing how they fit together for even the epistles which are written to the churches have a format and a formula which is very helpful to us if we can understand it.
[time=1845] One of the ways that Paul taught was to lay down a deep and significant foundation of doctrine and then upon that doctrine to build a strong practical application.
[time=1858] Most all of his epistles are put together that way, the doctrine and then the duty, the truth, and then that truth tested in the laboratory of everyday life.
[time=1869] One of the helpful things that we discover as we study the word of God is that there are some key words that help us to know when we're crossing over the threshold from doctrine to duty.
[time=1880] Now if we read it carefully enough, we will soon learn that but in this particular chapter that we've read from this morning, there is a threshold word and it's the word therefore.
[time=1891] Verse 58 says, "Therefore my beloved brethren
[time=1897] "and that word therefore throws us back "into the first part of the chapter "which is an unfolding of the great doctrine "of the resurrection of Jesus Christ "and our association with him in that resurrection.
[time=1909] "It is a truth which is the central and pivotal truth "of the word of God.
[time=1914] "Christ is risen from the dead and because of that "our preaching is not vain, our living is not vain, "our hope is not vain, but all that we have "in the Christian perspective is true "because Jesus is alive and in him we live also." And now Paul says, "Because you understand and know "and comprehend and believe the doctrine "of the resurrection of Christ, therefore I wanna say "some practical things to you about the way you ought to live." Now just in passing, let me remind you that this particular format is found many times in the Bible.
[time=1950] For instance, in the book of Romans, you move all the way through the eighth chapter, then you have chapters nine, 10 and 11 which are parenthetical, then you come to chapter 12 which begins the practical section of the book of Romans and how does it start?
[time=1963] I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies.
[time=1968] The therefore is there so that we might go back and find out what the foundation of our responsibility really is.
[time=1976] The old cliche is true when you see a therefore, you need to find out what it's there for and go back and understand what's underneath the truth that God wants you to learn.
[time=1985] The same principle is found in the book of Ephesians where in the fourth chapter, beginning the practical section of the book, we have these words, therefore walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called.
[time=1997] The therefore reminds us that chapters one to three are the doctrine upon which chapters four through six rest.
[time=2004] Over and over again, that principle is followed in the word of God.
[time=2009] Now in the verse that we are discussing together today, we need to understand at the very outset that these three practical admonitions rest squarely upon the biblical doctrine of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=2023] And it teaches us that because he is alive and because we live in him, we need to be different kind of people than the run-of-the-mill folks who live in the world, who don't know of the resurrection of Christ, who don't know anything of the resurrection life and their own body.
[time=2037] Because we believe that and we know that to be true, therefore certain things ought to be true in our lives.
[time=2043] Now as I have read this verse, taking it apart and put it back together, I have been overwhelmed with the tremendous appropriateness of the instructions of Paul to our day at this particular time.
[time=2057] And I believe that he has for us here three instructions that will help us to move into the new decade and into the new year with our wits about us spiritually and with the roads set out before us so that we can walk in such a manner as to please the Lord.
[time=2075] He reminds us of three things that we need to be doing.
[time=2078] First of all, he says, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, "be ye steadfast." Now, he tells us in this instruction that the first thing we need as we face the decade of destiny is an unwavering love for Christ and his word, an unwavering love for Christ and his word, "be ye steadfast." The word steadfast is an interesting word in the language of the New Testament.
[time=2105] It is the word, "hedreos" or "hedzomai." It is a word which means to be seated.
[time=2111] And there's a very interesting application of it back in the seventh chapter of 1 Corinthians, which I think demonstrates its real meaning.
[time=2119] In 1 Corinthians 7, 37, we read these words, "Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his heart." And when I read that and thinking of the meaning of the word steadfast, it suddenly struck me that here was an apparent contradiction.
[time=2136] He that standeth seated.
[time=2138] He that standeth seated in his heart.
[time=2142] What Paul is saying when he uses the word steadfast is that as Christians, though we may be standing tall on the outside and moving about in the affairs of life, that there's a part of our life that needs to be settled, seated, established, steadfast.
[time=2158] And that is our commitment to Christ and to his word and our love for him, the steadfastness of our faith.
[time=2165] Now, that word is found a number of times in the New Testament, especially in Paul's writings.
[time=2170] In the book of Colossians, we read chapter one, verse 23.
[time=2175] If you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, there's the word settled in your faith.
[time=2182] It is found in Colossians chapter two and verse five, "For though I am absent from you in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ." There's the word again.
[time=2197] What does it mean to be steadfast in your faith?
[time=2200] Well, it means to be sticking to it, to have personal fidelity to Christ, to be consistent, and as someone is written, to always be there, to be committed in your faith and in your life, to that which you have embraced in your salvation.
[time=2217] Now, if ever there was a day, when we needed to be reminded of the importance of steadfastness and an unwavering loyalty and love for Christ, it's this day in which we live.
[time=2228] For everything seems to be in the state of flux.
[time=2230] Nothing seems to be stable.
[time=2233] The standards of life are changing up and down.
[time=2236] The ability to get goods changes almost every day.
[time=2241] The morality, which the world accepts, is in a constant state of erosion.
[time=2246] And the Bible says that as Christians, in such an hour as this, because Jesus is alive and because we live in him, Christians, here is a call to be steadfast in your faith, to be sticking to it, to be unwavering in your love for Christ.
[time=2261] Now, if I could take a chapter out of Paul's pedagogy, let me say that in order for us to understand that we need to get it out of the general admonition area and down to the practical application area.
[time=2274] It is my estimation that our inward commitment is reflected in our outward activity.
[time=2281] For instance, I personally believe that a man who says he is deeply committed to Jesus Christ and to his word will reflect that commitment in the fact that he is where God's people gather when the word of God is open and taught and where he finds fellowship with one another.
[time=2297] I find it very hard to believe that a person says he is deeply committed to Jesus Christ and he never goes to church.
[time=2303] Now, I know some flaky people that are like that, but I don't know very many good Christians who say they're deeply committed to Christ and don't ever go to church.
[time=2313] If we love Christ and we're committed to him and to his word, we're gonna be where we can be instructed and encouraged and grow.
[time=2319] I believe that our commitment to Christ and our steadfastness and subtleness in the faith is going to be reflected in our willingness to be involved in serving God and in giving and all of these things that are involved in the outward activity of the faith.
[time=2334] It is possible to be outwardly involved without being steadfast, but I do not believe it is possible to be steadfast without being outwardly involved.
[time=2345] So let me ask you to do something.
[time=2347] Take just a moment and reflect upon 1979 and ask yourself how stable is my commitment to Jesus Christ?
[time=2354] And if you chart that by your involvement in the things of God and your attendance in the house of God, some of you would have a chart that would run off both the bottom and top of the page.
[time=2364] Your peaks and your valleys are so intense that I would know how to chart it.
[time=2369] One moment your way up here and the next moment your way down here.
[time=2372] And I like those people who just wave her along in that steady tradition of stability in the Christian perspective.
[time=2380] I was interested recently in listening to a tape that one of the men in our Christian businessmen's organization gave to me of a professor I had at Dallas Seminary by the name of Howard Hendricks.
[time=2390] Reporting on the great revival in Indonesia, he said that the people there are so hungry for the word of God and the facilities for studying the word are so inadequate.
[time=2399] That in the churches where he visited, they had to make a rule that if you were a Christian, you were only allowed to attend one service on Sunday because if you came to both, someone else wouldn't be able to attend.
[time=2410] And the revival continued to grow and the Christians multiplied until they had to alternate weeks in going to church because there was such an influx of Christianity and such a desire for the word of God and such a commitment to the truth of God that they didn't have buildings large enough to hold the crowds and they had to alternate weeks in studying the word.
[time=2431] And I thought to myself that we have a long way to go before we arrive there.
[time=2436] For our problems in Christendom here in the United States seems to be how do we get God's people to be where they ought to be and with the privileges that they have and the buildings and the facilities and the opportunities, how do we get them to do what God has told them to do?
[time=2450] To be steadfast in their commitment.
[time=2453] Dr. Hendricks went on to say that in most churches there are two kinds of Christians.
[time=2457] There are the pillars of the church that support the work and cause it to grow and move ahead and then there are the caterpillars who crawl in and out every week.
[time=2465] Everyone's either a pillar or a caterpillar.
[time=2469] And I'm afraid that in many of our churches where we hold to the truth of God we have lost our commitment, our deep seated to commitment to be always there where God would have us to be at the right time in the right place doing what he's called us to do.
[time=2483] There are more caterpillars than there are pillars.
[time=2485] We need in this new year
[time=2492] and in the beginning of this new decade a commitment to continue to be steadfast, stable.
[time=2500] Oh, what a virtue that is for Christian people.
[time=2502] You can count on them.
[time=2504] You know they're gonna do what they've been charged to do.
[time=2507] He goes on to say that we're not only to be steadfast but we're to be unmovable.
[time=2513] Now this is not New Testament tautology, one word heaped upon another, but it is a word altogether different than the first one and with a nuance that is totally other than the first word.
[time=2525] The word unmovable only occurs in the New Testament in this particular verse.
[time=2531] It's the only time it's found.
[time=2533] And it means to be always there when the tests have come against you, when the opposition has risen up against you and has tried to move you from where you stand, you're still there.
[time=2547] When the opposition comes against you in your Christian commitment and in your faith and in your testimony, when everyone is trying to push you away from where you stand, they have tried their best but you are unmovable.
[time=2560] Paul must have had this in mind when he wrote in the 16th chapter of 1 Corinthians in verse nine, these words he said, for a great door and effectual is open unto me and there are many adversaries.
[time=2577] You know the problem with standing steadfast is that there are so many people in the world and so many influences in the world that want you to be unsettled and to be unstable and they're forcing you and pushing against you, trying to get you to move.
[time=2591] Paul says that in this particular time we need to develop the quality of life that will be described and understood by this term, I am unmovable.
[time=2601] No matter what the enemy throws at me, I'm where I am because that's where God wants me to be.
[time=2607] Now as I thought about this word and I thought about moving into a new decade, I couldn't help but ask myself the question in the reading that I've done and trying to understand our time.
[time=2616] What kind of obstacles do we face in this new decade that would cause us to move against which we must make a deep commitment to be unmovable?
[time=2627] Though I can't in any way exhaust them, I have condensed them into three basic things that I want to share with you.
[time=2633] Concerns of my heart is a pastor working and ministering in our generation to a group of people that know and love the Lord for whom I have a deep desire to see them grow and be strengthened and matured in the faith.
[time=2646] The first opposition that I fear is this.
[time=2650] I fear the opposition of a desensitization to evil.
[time=2655] I believe that in our churches in this particular day, we have become desensitized to evil.
[time=2662] The things that used to trouble us deeply years ago now are commonplace with us.
[time=2669] The things that we used to cry out against in past generations as we were growing up now, we have become comfortable with.
[time=2676] It is not because we sat out on a course to be that way.
[time=2679] It is not that we sat down and objectively evaluated all of these things and said, I have decided that at this point in time, I'm going to feel differently about this particular thing than way I used to feel.
[time=2690] But we have allowed our commitment to the things of holiness and righteousness and purity to be eroded by the culture in which we live.
[time=2700] We have, as Paul warned us against, allowed the world, the poor us into its mold, to squeeze us into its pattern so that the things we used to be very concerned about now are commonplace and we let them slide along and we don't care about them and we don't deal with them.
[time=2717] And pretty soon other things begin to fall into that pattern and if we're not careful with the blitz of media and the stimuli of our society coming at us from every direction as Christians, we are going to lose our uniqueness and distinctiveness as Christians who believe in the word of God and the holiness of the God of the word.
[time=2739] The only way that I know of to deal with that is to be in this book every day, asking God to give us his perspective on the events and on the situations that we face, not listening to voices of the world.
[time=2751] The world can say it's all right and it may be all wrong.
[time=2755] The generation in which we live can say that it's acceptable but in God's eyes it isn't acceptable and men and women, God hasn't changed his mind and he's not going to change his mind in the 80s.
[time=2765] He believes just exactly what is written here and it's just as important that we adhere to it now as it was back then.
[time=2772] I fear in these next days that our churches are going to be desensitized to evil.
[time=2777] One of the things that I'm very concerned about is that even in evangelical God fearing Bible believing churches, if we're not careful we can begin to tolerate sin within the body.
[time=2788] God will not bless us if we do that.
[time=2791] And God help us as a church to understand that when it becomes evident that there is sin in the body and we don't deal with it, we are violating the principles of the Word of God.
[time=2800] We must not allow ourselves to become desensitized to sin in our own lives.
[time=2807] The second opposition that I fear is this.
[time=2811] I fear the proliferation of the born again movement.
[time=2814] You say, pastor, aren't you excited about everybody being born again?
[time=2819] Well, I guess so.
[time=2820] The Gallup poll recently published in Christianity Today tells us that one out of every five people in the United States is an evangelical.
[time=2828] Well, I don't know where all those people are, but they go on to qualify that in a very interesting way.
[time=2837] They took the one out of five and did a study on them and they discovered that in this one out of five, only six of 10 of them could identify you must be born again as the words of Jesus.
[time=2848] 50% of them couldn't name five of the commandments of the Old Testament.
[time=2854] Three out of 10 did not believe the devil was a reality.
[time=2857] I have to believe that Dr. Hendricks was right when he evaluated the born again movement of our day.
[time=2863] He said it's 60 miles wide and an eighth of an inch deep.
[time=2866] I believe he's right.
[time=2869] A born again movement, which will allow a man who was a known and avowed pornographer to continue publishing pornography without ever standing up and crying out against it.
[time=2879] There's something wrong with that kind of being born again.
[time=2883] That's not the born again movement that I read about in the Bible.
[time=2886] And the problem that we're going to face in the eighties is that it's popular to be born again.
[time=2891] Everybody's doing it.
[time=2892] It's a fad and it loses its doctrinal moorings so that the word means absolutely nothing and Satan is ahead of victory in a heyday when he's allowed that to happen.
[time=2902] I am concerned about the proliferation of the born again movement.
[time=2908] I believe that we ought to try to get everybody we can born again trusting the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior and rejoice in every soul that's won.
[time=2916] But the Bible tells us in the parables that there is the parable of the mustard seed that the church is going to grow to great dimensions.
[time=2923] But along with that, there's the parable of the wheat and the tears.
[time=2926] That in that great dimensional church, there will be the true and the false and they will grow together until the harvest.
[time=2931] And we need to be careful how we evaluate the great successes of the great revival's quote that are taking place here and there.
