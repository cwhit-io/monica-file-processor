[time=0] [Bell]
[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible hour with Pastor David German.
[time=47] I see the sun, I hear the holy thunder, why I would call the universe's flame.
[time=60] Then since I saw my day, I'll feel, I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[time=74] Let's sing my soul, I say you're not free, I'll bring the heart, I'll bring the hope.
[time=97] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=102] And we say welcome to all of you, those of you who have joined us here in the auditorium on this cold and frigid day in Fort Wayne, and all of you who have joined us now by television, I don't think we're on in any warmer climate so you're probably all experiencing the same thing.
[time=119] Welcome to our services, welcome to this opportunity to share with us as we open the Word of God and as we have opportunity to talk together about His goodness.
[time=129] We're grateful for the opportunity we have to share His goodness through music and through the message from the Scriptures, and it is our prayer that it will be a blessing to you as you join with us this morning.
[time=140] Listen now to our choir as they sing under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger, listen carefully to the words and praise God together with us.
[time=155] I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep.
[time=165] And Jesus are not even as others can no hope, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again.
[time=179] And so they're also asleep in Jesus, will God bring with Him, will God bring with Him?
[time=193] For this we say unto you, by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and we made unto the coming of the Lord.
[time=208] Shall God receive them which are asleep?
[time=219] For the Lord it tells shall be sent, prepared with the child, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God.
[time=237] And the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=247] When we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cost,
[time=260] to reap the Lord in the end.
[time=265] And so shall we ever be with the Lord, so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[time=278] For ever be with the Lord.
[time=294] A few moments I'm going to be speaking on the subject in pursuit of God.
[time=306] The music that we're going to share together in our service this morning is wrapped around that theme.
[time=312] Certainly the song that Marilyn is going to sing for us is a reminder to us that if we are going to know Jesus Christ in a personal way,
[time=321] there has to be a very special desire within our hearts.
[time=325] The time honored song I'd rather have Jesus.
[time=329] It's a beautiful song that I suppose we first became acquainted with through the ministry of George Beverly Shea years ago when he was singing even as he does today with Billy Graham all over the country.
[time=341] He used to sing that every time they would have a crusade.
[time=345] I'm a very well loved song and Marilyn does it beautifully. Listen carefully as she sings.
[time=364] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[time=384] I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land. I'd rather be led by his nail pierced hand
[time=403] than to be the king of a vast domain, or be held in sin's dread's way.
[time=422] I'd rather have Jesus than anything. This world affords today.
[time=444] I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause. I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause.
[time=464] I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame. I'd rather be true to his holy name than to be the king of a vast domain,
[time=493] or be held in sin's dread's way.
[time=504] I'd rather have Jesus than anything. This world affords today.
[time=534] We're so glad you joined us on the Bible Hour today, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to talk with you for these few moments,
[time=544] while we're receiving our offering here in this service. Normally, my wife, Donna, joins me during this time,
[time=550] but we have some children who are ill today, and so she's home taking care of them.
[time=555] But I've asked someone from our congregation to come and be with us because she has a very unique story to tell
[time=561] you, while it relates to something I want to make available to you on today's program.
[time=566] I'd like to introduce to you Virginia Carden, and Virginia has been a part of our church for many years, and right now, Virginia, you're going through a very difficult time in your life, and it has to do with the nature of a sickness you found out about not too long ago,
[time=582] and that sickness is not good news, is it?
[time=585] No, it isn't.
[time=586] The doctors really don't give you much hope for recovery, do they?
[time=590] No, they don't.
[time=592] And you've gone through some real ups and downs during these days, haven't you?
[time=597] That's right, I have.
[time=599] And we've talked about some of those together. This week, I got a letter from you that was challenged to keep on praying,
[time=608] but it was also a reminder of how God is working in your life.
[time=612] In that letter, Virginia, you told me about something God has been using recently, and I'd like for you to tell our friends about that.
[time=618] Yes, that's our little booklet that you put together for us called Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions.
[time=624] And I've gone through the book and numbered each one, and I take one psalm, one promise, and one prescription each week,
[time=632] and study it each morning, first thing.
[time=635] The booklet is about loneliness, and what you're saying to me, I guess, is that having an incurable sickness can be kind of lonely, can it?
[time=645] Yes, it can, but I'm not the only one lonely.
[time=648] We all have loneliness that we face daily, whether we have large families and are very healthy,
[time=655] or whether we have one or two people in our family, or what we call no earthly friends, but have a face of problem.
[time=662] How has the Scripture helped, Virginia? How has it helped and encouraged you?
[time=667] You can always turn to the Scripture, and it's always there.
[time=671] It's not like the people that you might call on the phone, and they're not home.
[time=675] You can always pick up the Word of God, and it leads you to the Lord, and He is always there to be with us.
[time=681] And these scriptures are arranged in this little booklet in a very beautiful way, so that they deal specifically with the problems of loneliness that you will face in your life.
[time=692] And I'd like to have the privilege of sending one of these to you.
[time=695] Your loneliness may not be related to illness.
[time=699] Virginia has mentioned a lot of different kinds of loneliness that come into a person's life, but your loneliness can be helped, and God is anxious to meet you at the point of your need,
[time=711] and He does that through His Word. This booklet is not what I have written.
[time=716] It is simply the collection of the words of God that deal with that problem.
[time=721] And you can have a copy of the book, Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions for the Lonely from God's Word,
[time=727] by simply calling this toll-free number.
[time=730] Go to your phone right now and call 1-800-453-9000.
[time=735] And when you call, tell the Bible our operator that you would like to have your free copy of the booklet,
[time=741] Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions for the Lonely.
[time=744] We'll send it to you as soon as we get your request, and you can begin to meditate upon God's Word even as Virginia has done over these past days.
[time=752] You may wish to choose one out of each section and just consider it and meditate upon it each morning.
[time=759] I promise you that God's Word will help. It always does.
[time=763] And as Virginia has said, He's always there.
[time=766] There's never a time when you call upon Him when He's not at home.
[time=770] We want this booklet to be of help to you, and we're happy to send it your way if you'll just let us know of your need today.
[time=777] I also want to remind you that now that we're into the first days of 1981, that some of you need to be thinking about your devotional plan for this year.
[time=786] We are so grateful for the many people who read through the Word of God last year with us in the Daily Walk Plan.
[time=793] I just want you to know that if you haven't already enrolled in the Daily Walk for 1981,
[time=800] you can do that by just getting in touch with us, letting us know you'd like to receive the Daily Walk, and we'll send you information in return mail.
[time=808] Now the Daily Walk takes you through the Word of God, and though the Bible doesn't change from year to year, the commentary on the Scriptures, which is written in each of these Daily Walk manuals, is changed each year so that it's new and fresh.
[time=820] And that means that if you went through the program last year, you can go through it again this year, and it will be very helpful in encouraging to you to read through the Scripture again in 1981.
[time=830] Once again, if you'd like to have your copy of the book, Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions for the Lonely, simply call 1-800-4539000, and that's the same number you use if you'd like to be enrolled in the Daily Walk.
[time=843] Read through the Bible in a year program.
[time=846] We'd be happy to hear from you if we can help you in either of these ways.
[time=850] Now, of course, it's always all right to write.
[time=852] We like to get your letters because, well, it's possible for you to communicate to us in a more definitive way,
[time=858] and we just really appreciate hearing from you through the mail.
[time=862] And if you're right, please address your letter to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=869] We'll be looking forward to hearing from you this week either by the toll-free number or through the mail,
[time=875] and it is our privilege to extend the ministry of the Bible hour into your home by providing this free literature which we know will be a help to you.
[time=883] Now, we're going back to our service, and just a moment, I'm going to open the Word of God to the Old Testament in the Book of Psalms and speak on the subject in pursuit of God.
[time=894] I hope you'll be with us as we continue today's Bible Hour.
[time=912] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=1153] (audience clapping) - Psalm 27 should be sung just like that.
[time=1171] Thank you, Keith, for sharing with us, and that was a real blessing.
[time=1176] I like the songs that come right out of the scripture, and you could sense as you looked in your Bibles at Psalm 27 that it comes right from the text.
[time=1184] I want to remind all of you that there's an opportunity for you to get involved in reading the Word of God through during this year.
[time=1191] We haven't said much about it, but we will provide for you the opportunity through the daily walk to get into the scriptures and read the Bible all the way through in 1981.
[time=1201] Now, some of you did that last year, and I want to remind you that the Bible hasn't changed.
[time=1205] We don't have a new version for you, but the information in the daily walk, the commentary on the scripture is all different and all new.
[time=1212] So if you read through it last year, you can read through it again this year and gain new and different insights into the scripture.
[time=1219] I would encourage you to do it here in this auditorium.
[time=1222] Those of you who are part of our church, if you will contact our office, you are not receiving the daily walk, we'd be happy to make it possible for you to do that.
[time=1229] And those of you who are watching at home, there is a special number you can call, which will probably be on the screen sometime during this hour.
[time=1237] If you'll call that number, we'll be happy to give you information about the daily walk.
[time=1242] Now, I'm so happy to introduce to you some brand new people here in Fort Wayne who are old friends, but brand new Fort Wainers.
[time=1250] They have just moved in.
[time=1251] I think they've been in their house about two days out of the month they've been here because they're traveling all over the country.
[time=1257] But they are settling down to be a part of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and they are going to be a part of our ministry and what God is doing here.
[time=1264] And I want you to welcome them officially to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=1270] God bless you.
[time=1271] (Applause)
[time=1280] (Music)
[time=1291] [MUSIC - 119 seconds]
[time=1430] Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1432] We look forward to many blessed times in fellowship and music with our friends.
[time=1438] Now, Fort Wayne people, Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=1443] I want you to open your Bibles this morning to the book of Psalms.
[time=1447] Psalm 42 is our scripture lesson.
[time=1452] And I'm reading the first three verses of this 42nd Psalm.
[time=1459] Psalm 42 verses one through three.
[time=1463] As the heart panteth after the water brooks,
[time=1470] so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
[time=1474] My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.
[time=1479] When shall I come and appear before God?
[time=1482] My tears have been my food day and night while they continually say unto me
[time=1488] where is thy God?
[time=1491] Let us pray together.
[time=1494] God in heaven, thank you for your word.
[time=1499] Thank you for its help in our lives each day.
[time=1504] Thank you for the unbelievable concepts that are found there, contained in places we would not think to look for great truth.
[time=1516] Thank you, Father, that when that concept that we study and understand begins to take control of our life, it begins to affect changes in us as we are obedient to the truth.
[time=1528] Lord, we ask that today the concept of a desire for God will explode within our hearts
[time=1535] as we understand it in a new and different way.
[time=1539] Draw us close to thee.
[time=1542] Lord, that we might be able to hear the slightest whisper that thy spirit would whisper in our ear.
[time=1549] During these moments that we study the Word of God together.
[time=1552] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1559] Well, the new year is here.
[time=1562] And that fateful day which supposedly closes the football season until another year has come and gone.
[time=1570] Wives everywhere are rejoicing that New Year's Day is over.
[time=1575] The long marathon of one game after another has been concluded, and so they think they can rest for a while.
[time=1584] But I have news for you women, the NFL playoffs are just beginning.
[time=1588] And there is a long time yet before you will be able to get your husband away from that fall and winter pastime football.
[time=1599] I have been accused of using an illustration from the sports world on occasion.
[time=1603] I met a new friend this week from Arlington, Texas, who only heard me preach one time, and the only thing he remembered was that I used an illustration from football.
[time=1613] And I am going to use another one this morning, not for his sake, but because I plan to do it long forever met him.
[time=1621] There is an interesting thing that happens in the sports world that took place just recently for those of you who are aware of what goes on in the football world.
[time=1631] Upon a Monday night, two teams supposedly evenly matched, met together in the Colosseum in Los Angeles, and the team from the West Coast demolished my favorite team from deep in the south.
[time=1646] In fact, it was a demolishment that was embarrassing.
[time=1651] It was almost impossible for me to show my face around here for four or five days and look positive.
[time=1658] They got creamed.
[time=1664] Just two weeks after that, those same two teams relocated their war to the friendly confines of Dallas Stadium in Irving, Texas.
[time=1675] And the same two teams, without any personnel changes, went to battle again
[time=1681] with almost exactly the opposite result.
[time=1685] In the first game, Los Angeles won 38 to 14, and in the second game, Dallas won 35 to 13.
[time=1693] How could it be?
[time=1695] How could it be that two teams playing the same sport with the same size ball
[time=1702] with the same people, the same coaches, the same personnel could play each other
[time=1709] two weeks apart and have such a drastic difference in the outcome?
[time=1715] Well, there have been many who have philosophized about that, and I suppose I could come up with a few of my own theories, but I won't.
[time=1724] I do know this that there was a dimension in those two games that changed from the one game to the next.
[time=1733] In the first game, Dallas went into Los Angeles with nothing to gain.
[time=1740] They had already clinched a spot in the playoffs.
[time=1742] They were already in the postseason battle for the Super Bowl, and they had to play that game because it was on the schedule.
[time=1750] They had nothing to gain except their own self-respect and continued momentum.
[time=1755] On the other hand, Los Angeles had everything to gain for.
[time=1758] They had not yet made their place in the playoffs, and if they were to lose, they would most certainly be out and not be able to compete.
[time=1768] Now, in the second game, the exact opposite was true.
[time=1772] Dallas needed to win that game in order to be able to do better in the playoff system,
[time=1780] plus they were so humiliated the two weeks before that if they didn't play well, they would lose all self-respect and not even be able to show up on the streets in Big D.
[time=1792] The different dimension in the two games is spelled by the word "desire."
[time=1799] And though I am not a psychologist nor do I intend to be one, there have been many studies done that demonstrate beyond any real shadow of doubt
[time=1811] that when two teams compete of equal ability in certain circumstances,
[time=1820] that the team that has the greatest desire to win will most likely become the winner.
[time=1828] Desire is something which grows within the human spirit that enables an individual to do at his very best ability, that which he has been gifted to do.
[time=1840] It works not only in the athletic world, it works in the world of business.
[time=1845] Show me two businessmen, one who is motivated inwardly to excel, and one who is just doing his job from week to week.
[time=1853] And I promise you that the one who has the desire will be the one who will perform and succeed.
[time=1860] Desire.
[time=1862] The inward willingness that says I will, I will achieve, I will conquer, I will, I will do it.
[time=1872] Where does that come from?
[time=1875] Well, maybe it comes from a locker room speech by a very motivating coach.
[time=1880] Maybe it comes from success motivation books or perhaps even from a preacher who now and then
[time=1887] is known to give motivational talks.
[time=1891] Where does it come from?
[time=1893] Why it comes from God.
[time=1896] God gives us our desire.
[time=1899] He gives us the equipment that makes it possible for us to have the will, the desire.
[time=1906] It is a part of the humanness that is ours by our creation in this world.
[time=1911] It is part of the equipment of the human spirit.
[time=1915] It should not surprise us then.
[time=1917] As we open the pages of the Word of God to discover that desire is a part of the way God works in our lives spiritually.
[time=1930] That it is the overwhelming thirst and hunger after God that is rewarded in the Christian experience.
[time=1941] Let me see if I can illustrate what I mean.
[time=1944] Years ago, a man by the name of Augustine, one of the early church fathers, wrote these words.
[time=1952] He said, "Who will give me what it takes to rest in you, O God?
[time=1957] Who will make it so you come into my heart and captivate it, so I can forget my rottenness and take hold of you, the one good thing in my life."
[time=1969] Augustine was desirous of knowing God in such a passionate way that the sin in his life would be blotted out.
[time=1977] A thousand years later, a woman by the name of Lady Julian of Norwich asked, "God of your goodness, give me yourself, for you are enough for me.
[time=1990] If I ask anything less, I know I shall continue to want, for only in you do I have everything."
[time=2000] Blaze Pascal, a theologian and philosopher summarized this same concept when he wrote,
[time=2007] "There was once in man a true happiness, of which there now remains in him only an empty trace which he vainly tries to fill out of his environment."
[time=2017] Yet all these efforts are inadequate because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object that is by God himself.
[time=2029] A. W. Tozer, whose writings I so admire, made this unbelievable observation about his time, which is our time.
[time=2040] He said, "The great people of the Bible and of Christian history have had an insatiable hunger for God."
[time=2049] But too few today really hunger for God.
[time=2053] He wrote, "He God wants to be wanted." Too bad it is that with many of us, he waits so long, so very long in vain.
[time=2064] Tozer said that God desires us to desire him, but that he waits so long in vain for us to exhibit that desire.
[time=2074] How in contrast that is with the words of the psalmist David who wrote, "As the deer thirsts for the water brook, as a deer on a long run away from his wood be captive,
[time=2088] is panting for the water that will quench his thirst as he pants for the water brook," David said.
[time=2098] So, panteth my soul after you, O God.
[time=2104] The New Testament counterpart of that truth is found in the book of Matthew.
[time=2109] It is the second of the Beatitudes and it says, "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[time=2117] for they shall be filled." I want to talk to you today about your spiritual desire, your spiritual hunger, your spiritual thirst.
[time=2132] I am quite often asked by individuals why it is that some Christians never seem to move ahead in the Christian life.
[time=2140] Why it is that they don't grow, that they don't mature, that they don't become better able to serve their God.
[time=2148] There are many reasons that could be listed.
[time=2151] Some say it is the circumstance of life.
[time=2154] Some say it is the church where they are nurtured.
[time=2157] Some say it is the economic situation in which they try to survive.
[time=2163] Put all of those reasons on the shelf and put instead in their place this basic principle, men and women,
[time=2171] we are in our relationship with God what we choose to be, what we desire to be.
[time=2181] And if we are not growing and maturing and developing as men and women of God, there is one basic fundamental reason to which we can point our finger and that is we have chosen not to be that.
[time=2194] We have filled our life with other desires and other things and we have reached out for the best that the world can offer
[time=2201] instead of reaching out for God to know Him and to love Him and to pursue Him and to be a part of Him.
[time=2210] You say what does it mean to be hungry? What does it mean to thirst after God?
[time=2217] It is not a desire on our part to have better morality.
[time=2224] Men who don't even know God strive for that.
[time=2227] It is not an intense desire to have better respectability.
[time=2234] Pagans are concerned about respectability in their culture.
[time=2242] What is it?
[time=2245] Think with me for a moment about a man who has a serious disease.
[time=2251] He is suffering from the awful pain that is the result of that sickness.
[time=2258] He cannot seem to get relief. The only passion in his life is to somehow do away with the pain,
[time=2265] to make it stop, to cut it off so that it no longer hurts.
[time=2271] So he goes to the doctor.
[time=2274] And the doctor says to him, "Where is the pain?" And he locates the spot where the pain is most severe.
[time=2285] And the doctor says, "I want you to know my only desire in my relationship with you as a patient my friend is that I might stop the pain."
[time=2294] And so immediately he goes to work and somehow through his medical ability he stops the pain,
[time=2300] but he never searches for the disease that causes the pain.
[time=2305] That is not a good doctor.
[time=2309] For a good doctor recognizes that pain is a blessing that God has built within the body to point to a deeper need that must be met.
[time=2320] And he goes beyond the pain to the source of the pain in order that he might deal with the disease.
[time=2329] There are quack doctors who stand in pulpits all over our country trying to deal with the pain and never get down to the disease.
[time=2342] God has made man with a God-shaped vacuum in his heart and he will never be at home until God is at home in his life.
[time=2352] And the pain that he feels in life that causes him to search for something to assuage it and to make it better is a part of the whole process that God has built within us to cause us to reach out for him and to bring him to ourself.
[time=2366] And what does humanity do when that pain comes?
[time=2370] Why, they go to drugs to try to drown it out.
[time=2374] They get involved in the promiscuousness of our day to try to do away with it.
[time=2381] They run in the circles that are so fast they have no time to think of their pain in order that they might not have to deal with it.
[time=2388] And yet the Scripture says that the pain will not really ever go away, the pain of an empty life until we come to the source of the pain and we deal with it.
[time=2400] And that source of men and women is sin and the answer to that is God.
[time=2405] And until God comes to live within the heart of a man, the pain will not go away.
[time=2413] So for the unbeliever, the hunger for God must be met first of all by coming to know him in a personal way and accepting him as Lord and Savior and filling that emptiness in your heart with that for which that vacuum was created with God himself.
[time=2434] We are talking today to a majority of Christian people.
[time=2439] And I want to be very sure that you understand that when you find in Jesus Christ the water of life that causes you never to thirst again and the bread of life which satisfies you, that does not mean that your spiritual hunger stops.
[time=2456] Some folks seem to feel that once they get salvation they've eaten their last spiritual meal.
[time=2463] But men and women, the people that God blesses and the folks that he uses and the individuals upon whose life his power is evident are men and women of the faith who have an insatiable desire to know God more and more and more and to be more like him and to embrace his truth
[time=2484] and his precepts in their life.
[time=2487] The Apostle Paul who we look upon as a spiritual giant was at the very close of his life and he said that his all-consuming passion was that he might know God, that he might know him.
[time=2501] I want to share with you today that that ought to be the thing that drives us in the days of this new year.
[time=2511] An overwhelming hunger and thirst after God that will captivate our very beings so that it structures our life around that one need and that need being met.
[time=2524] There are four or five areas where I think that is crucial.
[time=2529] And I want you to look with me this morning at some scriptures that will help you to understand what I'm talking about when I talk about spiritual hunger and thirst.
[time=2538] And I remind you again that the basic tenet of our message is that we will be spiritually exactly what we desire to be, nothing more, nothing less.
[time=2551] First of all, if we are to know God's blessing in our life, we must be hungry to know his plan for our everyday.
[time=2560] Turn with me and your Bibles to the book of 1 Samuel.
[time=2564] In the book of 1 Samuel and the 12th chapter, 1 Samuel chapter 12 and verse 24.
[time=2575] Samuel's words to the people over whom he had responsibility are words of great insight into this particular problem.
[time=2585] He writes, "Only fear the Lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he has done for you."
[time=2598] Samuel said to his people, "If you want to know the joy and blessedness of godly living, serve your God with your whole heart.
[time=2607] Make that the passion of your life to know how to serve him and to follow his leadership." When Moses was praying to God for his people, a prayer recorded in the third chapter of Exodus, he wrote these words.
[time=2621] He said, "Now therefore I pray thee. If I have found grace in thy sight, show me thy way that I may know thee."
[time=2633] Moses' driving hunger was to know God's plan and his purpose and his way for Moses' life and for the life of his people.
[time=2643] And if we were to know the blessedness that God has for us in the new year, it ought to so motivate us to lock into the plan of God for our life that we would stop short of nothing to know it so that we might do it.
[time=2656] It blows my mind how many Christians there are who just seem to do whatever falls in front of them.
[time=2663] Whatever comes naturally, whatever comes next, who never stop for a moment to find out what is God's plan for my life and what would he have me to do?
[time=2673] I can say from experience as fresh as this past summer that the will of God can be known if you want to know it.
[time=2682] If you desire to know that more than anything else in your life and if you will lock in upon the heart of God and say, "Oh God, show me thy way," he will do it.
[time=2693] But there is so little hunger and so little thirst after that in our lives.
[time=2700] Isn't any wonder that God does not waste his time on the frivolous man who pauses briefly to check in on God along the way?
[time=2713] Not only must we know God's plan for our life, but we must also be hungry for his precepts in our lives, for you see his plan is tied to the precepts of his word.
[time=2729] There isn't any way to know the will of God without being associated with the Word of God.
[time=2735] And in the Scripture we have many illustrations of the importance of desire as it relates to Bible study.
[time=2744] As we open the Word of God, so often it's Lord, a chapter a day keeps the devil away, so here goes I'll get it over with, you know?
[time=2754] Read it, mark it on your little chart and go on your way. And you said, "I didn't get anything out of it. Well, you didn't put anything in it."
[time=2761] You get out of it, what you put in it.
[time=2764] And part of the understanding of the Word of God is to come to it with great desire to know what it says.
[time=2772] Do you pray before you read the Scripture, "Oh God, I have a hungry heart today. I need something from your Word.
[time=2779] Open it to me that I might understand it, that it might meet the need in my life today. I want more than anything to know what this book says."
[time=2787] Or do you just go through the perfunctory practice of doing your Bible reading?
[time=2792] Great deal of difference between the two approaches.
[time=2796] And as we open the Scriptures, we are reminded in a couple of Old Testament passages that I will read for you and in one other that I want you to read with me.
[time=2806] The importance of coming to the Scripture with an insatiable desire to know what it says.
[time=2812] For instance, in the book of Deuteronomy in the 11th chapter in verse 13, we read, "And it shall come to pass if ye shall harken diligently unto my commandments,
[time=2823] which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with your whole soul."
[time=2830] That says that when we come to the Word of God, we're going to look at it carefully so that we do not miss even one nuance of what God says.
[time=2838] Alas, so many Christians come to it looking for every loophole they can find to get out from under its influence in their life.
[time=2845] If I can just find out what the least common denominator is, I will do that and no more.
[time=2851] God will not speak to such a heart.
[time=2854] In the book of Joshua, in the 22nd chapter in the closing speech of that great general who led the people of Israel into the Promised Land and settled them there,
[time=2865] Joshua said, "But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses, the servant of the Lord,
[time=2873] charged you to love the Lord your God and to walk in all his ways and to keep all his commandments and cleave to him,
[time=2880] and serve him with all your heart and with all your soul." Do you see the word desire written over all of those passages?
[time=2889] I am here in this book because I want to be, because it is the most important thing in my life and I must hear from God.
[time=2901] Turn now in your Bibles to Psalm 119.
[time=2905] I wish I could take you as I have on occasion with the people here in this congregation,
[time=2911] to all of the passages of Scripture in Psalm 119 that speak of desire in relationship to the Word of God.
[time=2918] They are numerous and I have them underlined in my Bible.
[time=2923] But I bring you to just one, just one passage that shows you why God blessed the life of David as he blessed him.
[time=2932] Psalm 119 and verse 20.
[time=2936] "My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thine ordinances at all times."
[time=2946] That's what David said.
[time=2948] David said, "My soul broke.
[time=2951] My heart is broken for the longing that I have to know your word in my life to understand its precepts so that I might practice them."
[time=2961] Is it possible that the reason we are so often losers instead of winners in the Christian experience is because that little edge that desire gives us when we come to the Word of God is not there?
[time=2977] We have no hunger, we have no thirst, and so God cannot speak to us.
[time=2990] God tells the man who cares.
[time=2993] Fascinating title.
[time=2995] It says, "In essence, you can hear from God if you want to." And in the opening pages of that little booklet, he writes these words, "He said the Bible was written in tears, and to tears it will yield its best treasures.
[time=3010] God has nothing to say to the frivolous man.
[time=3015] It was to Moses a trembling man that God spoke on the mountain.
[time=3020] And that same man later saved the nation when he threw himself before God with the offer to have himself blotted out of God's book for Israel's sake.
[time=3030] Daniel's long season of fasting and prayer brought Gabriel from heaven to tell him the secret of the centuries.
[time=3038] And when the beloved John wept much, because there was no one to open the seven sealed book of Revelation, one of the elders comforted him with the joyous news that the lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Christ had prevailed, and he was worthy to open the book.
[time=3058] What is Tose your saying? He is saying that these men of God, who were used of God, one of the ingredients in their life was an unbelievable desire for God to speak through them and to them and to control them and to make his word meaningful in their life.
[time=3081] If we are to know something of the blessing of God in this new year, it will come about as we have desire to know the precepts of God.
[time=3095] Thirdly and quickly, we must have a desire to know and a hunger to know the power of God in our lives.
[time=3105] Listen to the words of Psalm 63 one and two.
[time=3110] Oh God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee, my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is.
[time=3126] What a description of God in the midst of our society, in a dry and thirsty land where no water is there is God and we search for him and we seek for him and we thirst for him and we hunger for him.
[time=3139] Listen to what the psalmist says, I do all of this that I might see thy power and thy glory in my life.
[time=3152] Is there a desire within your heart to know all that God can ever do and be within your being?
[time=3160] Is there a dissatisfaction with the commonplace experience of most Christians who are willing to settle for the average, the mediocrity that comes in most Christian lives?
[time=3172] Is there a desire within you that says, Oh God, I want your power upon my life and I want to be a tool as sharp as I can be for your honor and glory that I might cut the biggest swath I can cut for your sake, that I might know your power?
[time=3188] Is there a hunger in your life for the power of God?
[time=3201] Last but not least, we draw all of these cords together with the realization that that hunger is not going to ever be satisfied if we spread it out across this wide perspective that we have given.
[time=3216] But all of these things, every one of them are to be found as we are hungry for his presence in our life.
[time=3224] That's what the psalmist was saying when he said in Psalm 42, my soul panteth after thee, Oh God.
[time=3234] And we are encouraged as we open the book of Jeremiah to the 29th chapter in verse 13 and there we read, listen carefully,
[time=3242] and ye shall seek for me, and ye shall find me when ye search for me with all of your heart.
[time=3252] Do you know what it is to search out after God with all of your heart?
[time=3257] To pour all of the desire that you've ever given to the most important project in your whole life and to funnel that desire into your keen, edged desire to know God in a personal way and to have him function in your life?
[time=3271] Whatever it is that you're missing, whatever it is that isn't happening within you, some of it may be laid to the fact that in your heart there is no hunger and no thirst after God.
[time=3291] Most of you know the story of Augustine's conversion. He was a religious man functioning in the church of his day, but he did not know God, and his mother, Monica, knew that he did not know God, and she prayed for his salvation.
[time=3309] After he was converted in a very unusual way by hearing the scripture read in a garden outside of the place where he lived, he wrote these words which may describe you, and certainly in some measure have described me.
[time=3325] He wrote, "I came to love you late, oh beauty, so ancient and so new. I came to love you late. You were within me and I was outside where I rushed about wildly searching for you like some monster loose in your beautiful world.
[time=3345] You were with me, but I was not with you. You called me. You shouted to me. You broke past my deafness. You bathed me in your light. You wrapped me in your splendor. You sent my blindness reeling.
[time=3359] You gave out such a delightful fragrance, and I drew it in, and I came breathing hard after you. I tasted, and it made me hunger and thirst. You touched me, and I burned to know your peace."
[time=3376] Is that what's going on in your life? Is there a burning hunger to know God? Is there a desire that's beyond any desire you know to be related to him?
[time=3389] I read several years ago, Hudson Taylor's spiritual secrets, and in the front of my Bible I wrote these words which he used to describe the key to his life. He said, "In his desire for God, I saw him, and I sought him, and I had him, and I wanted him."
[time=3415] Do you want God? Christian, do you want him to be in your life, you're all in all, to give you in your life power that you have not had?
[time=3426] Unsaved person, is there a hunger in your life for something that's missing? Are you on that wild tram which so many people seem to be on these days trying to find meaning for your life?
[time=3441] It's going to be found in the bread of life, and the thirst is going to be quenched in the water of life in Jesus Christ. Come to him. He waits for you. Shall we pray?
