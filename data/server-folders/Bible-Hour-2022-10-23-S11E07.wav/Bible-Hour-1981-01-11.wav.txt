[time=1408] up to the brim, and he saith unto them, draw some out now, and bear it unto the governor
[time=1415] of the feast, and they bore it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was, but the servants who drew the water knew,
[time=1427] the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him, every man at the beginning
[time=1433] doth set forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse, but
[time=1440] thou hast kept the good wine until now. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of
[time=1447] Galilee, and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.
[time=1454] And while we're standing, let's pray together, shall we? Father in heaven, thank you for this word from God. This record of the first miracle of our Savior, the Lord Jesus, as we unfold
[time=1468] its truth, Lord, help us to understand its meaning, and teach us what you want us to know, Lord, from the word of God, and then help us to be obedient and apply it to our
[time=1478] own hearts, whatever the situation in our life might be. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1485] You may be seated. A man by the name of Leslie D. Weatherhead has written a book entitled
[time=1498] It Happened in Palestine. It is an awful book. It is a book which makes fun of the miracles
[time=1506] of Jesus Christ, and tries to explain them in some way other than the supernatural work
[time=1512] of God. And in his book, It Happened in Palestine, Mr. Weatherhead explains the story we have
[time=1519] just read in the following way. He says, "The wine runs out. Water is served. Why, that's
[time=1527] the best joke of all. They lift their wine cups as we do in fun when we shout, "Adam's
[time=1534] ale is the best of all. The bridegroom is congratulated by the master of ceremonies who carries the
[time=1540] joke further still. Why, you've kept the best wine until now," he says. It requires only
[time=1547] a servant going through the room in the kitchen for just a moment to hear that happen for
[time=1553] a wonderful rumor to start. Thus explains the gospel according to Mr. Weatherhead, which
[time=1561] in my estimation has its source in some place other than heaven or the earth. Mr. Weatherhead's
[time=1569] analogy of the gospel. Now the problem with that is that it just didn't happen that way. In fact, the scripture says in verse 9 that the Lord Jesus Christ changed the water
[time=1581] into wine. Now that's what the scripture says. And verse 11 tells us that that was such a miraculous thing that happened that the result of it was the disciples believed
[time=1591] on Jesus and that Jesus displayed his glory through that first of miracles. Someone has
[time=1598] said that it is morally incredible that the beginning of Jesus' signs could have been
[time=1605] some sort of conjuring trick. This was not a trick. This was a miracle from God. Now in
[time=1613] the 20th chapter of the gospel of John, we have the key to the understanding of the book.
[time=1617] And the key says this. These things are written. This book are written that you might believe
[time=1624] that Jesus is the Christ. Many other signs did Jesus, but these are written that you might
[time=1630] believe. And this is the first of the signs. Now in the Bible there are a number of words
[time=1636] that are used for the miraculous dealings of our Lord. There is the word, for instance,
[time=1642] air gone, which has to do with his work. One of the most popular words is the word dunamis, which means power, a powerful display. The word dunamis does not even appear in the gospel
[time=1653] of John. And whenever you see the word miracle at least 17 times in the gospel, you can be
[time=1659] sure that it is the translation of one word. It is the word samayah, a word which means
[time=1665] a sign, a miracle that's more than just a miracle. It is a miracle with a meaning behind
[time=1671] it that we need to understand. And John's gospel is filled with the works of Christ
[time=1678] centered around 7 samayah, 7 signs which he wrought, and then all of those signs are
[time=1684] explained in the context of the gospel. Now the Bible says that this miracle that we
[time=1690] are studying today is the first miracle that Jesus ever performed. Verse 11 says, the beginning
[time=1698] of miracles. Now I think that's important, that we stop for just a moment and discuss the fact that this was the first miracle. For quite often in our study of the Bible, we
[time=1712] hear from people who think that Jesus performed miracles before this time in his life, that
[time=1721] he was always performing miracles even as a little child. There's a story in a book called the Gospel of Thomas. It is an apocryphal book. It's not a scriptural book. And that
[time=1732] story says that on a day Jesus Christ, as a little boy, was out playing by the side of the bank of the river, and he took some clay that he got with his hands, and he made twelve little pigeons, and he had them there. And his father came out and said to him, what are you doing? Don't you know this is the Sabbath day, and you shouldn't be doing that. And with that the Lord Jesus clapped his hands, and according to the apocryphal story, the birds flew away, chirping. Well I don't believe that. I don't believe that's true. You know
[time=1762] why? Because the Bible says this was the first miracle Jesus ever did. My Jesus is not some kind of an apocryphal magic worker. He is the miracle-working Son of God, and his first
[time=1773] miracle was done in accordance with this particular setting, and we have the record of it. He
[time=1779] did it in Cain of Galilee as a full-grown man as he made his public appearance and began
[time=1786] his public ministry. So this is the first sign miracle of Jesus Christ, the beginning of
[time=1792] His miraculous works. Now, if we're to understand this miracle, we need to take the following
[time=1798] approach to it. First of all, as we study the text, let's look at the marriage setting,
[time=1804] verses one and two. And then secondly, let's look at the miracle sign, verses three through
[time=1810] ten, and then finally, let's look at the meaningful significance in the last verse. Now first
[time=1816] of all, the marriage setting. The Scripture says that this miracle was performed at a wedding
[time=1822] that Jesus and His disciples were invited to, and the Scripture begins by saying that it was three days, three days from the events that are recorded in chapter one, and Jesus
[time=1833] and His disciples are in Cain of Galilee, a place that is mentioned only twice in the
[time=1839] book of John, and it is never referred to again in all of the Bible. Cain of Galilee is the home of Nathaniel, the disciple, and in Cain of Galilee there was a wedding, and
[time=1849] Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. Now I don't know who was getting married. The Bible doesn't tell us the name of the couple that was being married, but it had to have been someone who was close to the Lord Jesus because as we study the story, we discover that His mother Mary was there, and that she had a very important part in
[time=1869] the wedding feast. In fact, she was so important that when she spoke to the servants and she said, "You do what He says. They did it." She was a significant person in that wedding, and so the Lord Jesus and His disciples were invited to a wedding of some friends that they knew, some friends that they had. Now the wedding that Jesus was invited to, and
[time=1888] the marriage feast that He was invited to, isn't anything at all like our weddings.
[time=1895] Our marriages are all together different today than they were in the New Testament. The Jewish marriage had a whole custom wrapped around it, so different than ours. First of all,
[time=1905] the marriage was begun with what they call the betrothal period, which is sort of like our engagement, except it was much more serious, and it lasted a whole lot longer, and it was
[time=1916] a very serious thing to break the betrothal. In fact, a Jewish couple that broke betrothal had to go through divorce proceedings because that was such a very significant time. Now at the end of the betrothal period, according to the culture of the New Testament, the bridegroom
[time=1932] and his friends would come to the house of the bride, and there they would take the bride
[time=1938] and bring her from her house to the house of the bridegroom. While they were at the house of the bride, there would be a few speeches, and folks would get up and wish them well and all of that, and then they would have a beautiful parade from the house of the bride to the house
[time=1953] of the bridegroom. Sometimes it took place by night. It was a torchlight parade, a very beautiful customary thing to do, and when they got to the house of the bridegroom, they would
[time=1964] begin the marriage. The bride and groom began to live together, and for a whole week they had a big celebration. A marriage feast sometimes would last for a whole week. Our little receptions
[time=1975] that we think go on and on and on while we're waiting for all the gifts to be open are nothing compared to the way they did it back then. They celebrated for a whole week, and it was to this kind of a marriage feast that Jesus and his disciples were invited to. Now there were at least six of them, because if you study the first chapter, you discover that he'd already gotten ahold of Andrew and Simon, and Philip and Nathaniel were a part of it, and it is quite evident to me that John the Apostle was there too, because he writes about this like he was an eyewitness, like he was right there in the midst of it all. I can't help but believe that when verse 11 says that the disciples believed that he was one of them.
[time=2013] And so there are six men who came to this feast by invitation, and that's the way it was. That was the way that the weddings took place back then, and that was the kind of setting
[time=2025] to which Jesus and his disciples entered. Now before we go on to examine the miracle that
[time=2032] took place in that setting, let me just stop for a moment and make a couple of applications that I think are important. This is the first miracle of our Lord, and isn't it interesting
[time=2043] that he did not perform his first miracle in a house of mourning, but in a place of
[time=2050] rejoicing. He did not perform his first miracle at a funeral, but at a marriage. It wasn't
[time=2059] at a fast. It was at a feast. And when I think about that, I think that's something for us
[time=2068] just to kind of write down in our little book, because you know I know some Christians that aren't really sure whether we even are a smile, and that Jesus was a sorrowful, doleful man.
[time=2080] You know one of the first things he ever did was go to a feast, and one of the last things he did for he went back to heaven to sit down and eat dinner with his disciples. And when I meditated on that, I started feeling better about myself all the time. Just to think about that, that's the way our Lord did. He loved to go and eat with his people and be with them and rejoice with them. We have a saying around this church that where two or three are gathered together, there someone will serve dessert, and I think there's some truth to that. But I don't think Jesus would be all that uncomfortable in that setting. He sanctified the joyous of occasions of his people, and he enjoyed being where festive
[time=2119] things took place. He did come to comfort our sorrows, that's true, but he also came
[time=2125] to sanctify our joys. And Jesus is anxious for us to be joyful, and he's very much at
[time=2132] home in the places where we're enjoying him and each other and the things of God that he provides for us. Now that's the first thing I want us to notice. Now I want you to notice, secondly, that he performed this miracle in a home. He didn't do it in a temple. That's
[time=2147] where they worshiped, but he performed it in a home. In a simple little Jewish dwelling
[time=2153] place, they worshiped in the temple, but they lived in the home. Every time I marry someone
[time=2159] in this church, I always say to them as a part of the marriage ceremony that the Lord Jesus put his stamp of approval on a home when he performed his first miracle at the
[time=2170] marriage in Cana of Galilee. I remember reading some time ago a book by a man named Green
[time=2177] Armitage, and in this book he portrays Saint Luke, the writer of the third gospel, and
[time=2184] he says that Luke delighted to show Jesus Christ against the backdrop of simple, homey
[time=2191] experiences. And in a very vivid phrase, he says that in Saint Luke's gospel, we have
[time=2199] God domesticated. Do you know something God is domesticated? He is just as important
[time=2208] in your home as he is in your church. It's just as important that he be in your home and involved in the life of your family as it is that he be involved in the corporate ministry and life of the church. Now I want to tell you something, if you're a young couple planning to get married, it's a good idea to invite Jesus Christ to your wedding.
[time=2228] It really is. I want you to notice that he didn't come to this wedding into this marriage when it was falling apart. He came to it at its foundation when it was getting started.
[time=2237] And if there's ever a time when Jesus Christ ought to be a part of a relationship, it's when the wedding is about to take place and the couple is coming together and I say to you, invite him to your wedding. Make sure he's comfortable in your relationship and then invite him into your home. Make him part of your family life. He said by what he did in
[time=2256] this first miracle that he's in favor of the home and he's comfortable there. And that
[time=2262] was the setting of the first miracle, a marriage feast in a humble dwelling which we call a
[time=2268] home. Now let's talk for a moment about the miracle sign. When Jesus and his disciples
[time=2274] got to that wedding, the first thing that happened when they walked in the door was
[time=2280] that they were confronted with a problem. And I don't know if this does anything for you, but it helps me a little bit to realize that there is never a miracle in the Bible that is not precipitated by a problem. No problems, no needs, no miracles. If you have
[time=2297] a problem, you're a candidate for a miracle. If you've got a need, you're a candidate for God's grace. Now they had a need in this wedding situation and as soon as Jesus got there, they told him what their problem was. He said, "There's no wine. It was a crisis for the caterer. I want you to know." And it wasn't just an inconvenience. Sometimes we read this and we say, "Well, why did he perform a miracle?" I mean it just ran out of wine. What's that? But you see in the Jewish culture, if the bridegroom and his family
[time=2327] failed to provide enough for the wedding feast, if they ran out during the wedding feast,
[time=2333] they could be sued. Can you imagine that? To be sued for not having enough food to fill
[time=2340] all the hungry guests who come to your wedding? Well, that's the way the culture was in those days. And when Jesus saw that and realized the embarrassment of the bridegroom and the
[time=2349] family, and then he heard that the wine had run out, that was the problem that caused this first miracle to come to pass. Now, there's an interesting little interchange
[time=2362] between the Savior and his mother. He's standing there and she walks up to him and she says,
[time=2368] "They have no wine." And Jesus says, "Well, what is that to me?" And some folks have
[time=2378] really had a problem with that in the Scripture. They think that the Lord Jesus is being disrespectful of his mother. They don't even like the fact that he calls her woman. But you understand
[time=2388] now that this phrase, which is here in the second chapter, when Jesus says, "What have
[time=2396] I to do with thee?" It is a semitism. It is a Hebrewism. It's sort of an idiom. And if
[time=2402] we translate it right out of the language of the Bible, we would say it this way, "What to me and thee?" And someone has explained it this way. It is a kind of way of speaking
[time=2412] that the Jews had, which indicated a divergence between the thoughts of the people involved.
[time=2419] In essence, what Jesus was saying is this, "Mary, what you're thinking about is not my
[time=2425] main concern right now." All right, like one paraphrase I read this week, I suppose all men have said this to their wives at one time or another. "Lady, let me handle this
[time=2436] in my own way." In essence, that's what Jesus said. He said, "Lady, just let me handle
[time=2442] this my own way." Now, some folks say he shouldn't have called her mother. He should have called her mother instead of woman. But you know, the word woman is used often in the New Testament in the words of Jesus to address the people that he touched. For instance, when he worked a miracle on a lady, he called her woman. When he was at the well, in the fourth chapter
[time=2463] of the book of John, with a Samaritan woman, he called her woman. And when he encouraged
[time=2470] that woman who had been taken in adultery, that's the way he addressed her. And when he was hanging on the cross in the dying moments of his life, he looked down to the apostle John
[time=2481] and he looked to his mother. And what did he call her? He said, "Woman, behold I, son,
[time=2487] son, behold I, mother." So that's not, that's just the way that they talk. That's not a
[time=2493] bad term, not a term that shows disrespect. And it's obvious in the text that she was
[time=2499] not rebuked, she was not hurt, she was not offended. For as soon as he said that, she
[time=2505] understood. She, she in essence, she said, "Well, all right." And then she turned to the servants and she said, "Whatever he tells you to do, you just do it." You know, that's
[time=2515] a tremendous truth. That's the key to all servanthood, isn't it? Mary's words are the
[time=2521] key to being a good servant of the Lord. Just whatever he tells you to do, you just do it.
[time=2529] And that's how she explained to them that they were now going to be the servants of the Lord. And whatever he told them to do, they, they were to do it exactly the way
[time=2539] he told them. Now, what he did then was he performed a miracle. Now the scripture says
[time=2545] that at that marriage feast, there were six big water pots. And I know what you're thinking
[time=2552] because this is the way I've always thought too. You're thinking about those water pots, you've got a picture in your mind right now. They're those big, beautiful water pots that kind of come up like this and then they get narrow and then they flare out at the top.
[time=2562] And when you go to luxurious places, sometimes they're sitting right inside the door and sometimes they have a plant in them or they're just beautiful, greasion urns. They weren't like that at all. You can just take that picture right out of your mind because that's not the way it was. These were big, huge labors. You know how big they were? Well, let's do
[time=2581] a little mathematics. The scripture says that these labors held two or three verkins apiece.
[time=2592] Now I don't know about you, but that doesn't mean anything to me. I went into a pizza store the other day to get something to take home to my family and I asked them if they'd give me some drinks to take home. I wanted some Pepsi or Coke and she said, well, do you want a liter? I said, what? I just want a big Coke. No, you got to tell me whether you want a
[time=2613] liter or not. Well, I had to go back and figure all that out and I said, would you go get one and bring it out here and show me what I'm buying? If I'm going to buy a liter, I want to know what it is. I'm going back there one of these days and ask her for a furkin of Coke. I'm going to get even a third. A furkin is equal to about eight or nine
[time=2635] gallons, according to the scripture. And so two or three furkins are 20 or 30 gallons.
[time=2641] So these were pretty good-sized urns, good-sized water pots. And so he's saying to these servants,
[time=2650] you go fill up those great big labors. Now, the purpose of the labor at the feast was for purification's sake. The Jews were the most ceremonial of all. I mean, when you went
[time=2660] to a marriage feast, do you know how they got ready to eat? First of all, they'd washed their feet when they came in, they used the water in those pots. Then when they'd sit down, they'd take water and they'd pour water over their hands this way till it ran down on the wrists. And then that wasn't enough. They turned their hand over and they took some more water and it poured it down here till it ran down off their fingers. And they didn't do that just at the beginning of the feast in between every course they went back through that. So they had to have a lot of water at a feast because they just kept washing their hands and washing their hands. It was all part of the custom. Now, Jesus said to the servants, you take those and you fill them clear up to the brim because they'd already been used some. And so they did. And when they fill these water pots up with water, that
[time=2704] was the beginning of the miracle. Now, I know what you've always thought about this story.
[time=2709] You thought that when that happened, we had 150 gallons of wine sitting there in all those
[time=2718] big jugs. But that's not what the Scripture says. And I have reason to believe as I've studied this story that those jugs weren't all filled with wine. Can you imagine a ceremonially
[time=2729] sensitive Jew drinking anything that would come out of the purification vessel from which
[time=2737] they washed their hands and their feet and their pots and pans and utensils for cleanliness purposes? No, the Scripture says that the servants took out of those pots of water and
[time=2750] bore it to the governor of the feast. And the governor didn't know where it came from.
[time=2756] And somewhere between when he got the water out of the pot and he got it to the governor, the miracle took place. I don't know if it was step one or three or seven. All I know was when he got there and the governor looked at it and he drank it, why it wasn't water
[time=2770] at all, it was wine. It was a miracle. How did God do that? Well, men and women, if he
[time=2780] could make the water in the first place, don't you think he could change it into anything he wanted it to be? I like what an old divine wrote about that. He said the water discovered
[time=2790] it was in the presence of the Lord and it blushed. Well, I'll tell you what, that is
[time=2799] a tremendous picture for all of us. Jesus, working a miracle, his first ever miracle.
[time=2808] And the ruler of the feast analyzed it this way. He said, "Every man at the beginning
[time=2815] does set forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse, but thou's kept the good wine until now." So it wasn't a halfway job. He did it right. It was the best there was. Now, that's the miracle. We've talked about the marriage setting and
[time=2832] the miracle sign. Now, what is the meaningful significance? Remember, I told you that a same a sign was a miracle with a deep underlining significance. What is the meaningful significance
[time=2845] of this miracle? There are so many that we could talk about, but I think, in good measure,
[time=2852] they come down to three basic things that God wants us to know as we read this passage and as we study it. First of all, there is a doctrinal meaning. What happened when the
[time=2863] miracle was performed? Well, verse 11 says that Jesus manifested his glory and the disciples
[time=2869] believed on him. What did they believe? They believed that he was who he said he was. He
[time=2875] was the Son of God, the Savior of the world. He was deity. Just in the first chapter, he had called them to follow him and be with him, and now he's worked this first miracle in their eyes, and they see him for what he is, and they believe on him that he is the Son of God. And the gospel of John is written men and women that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, that we might believe his deity, that he is the God of God's.
[time=2900] And there's a doctrinal significance. They believe that Jesus Christ was God. That was the first purpose, the first meaningful significance. Now secondly, there is a dispensational meaning.
[time=2913] And I don't want to be too fanciful here. You know, sometimes when you read these scholars who write on typology, by the time you get done reading what it means, you've forgotten
[time=2923] what the story was. But you cannot ignore that this is a time in the history of the Jewish
[time=2931] people through which they are transisting. For instance, in chapter one, we read these
[time=2937] words. He came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many as did received
[time=2943] him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God. He came unto his own, the Jews, and
[time=2949] they would not have anything to do with him. And so he turned then to the ministry of
[time=2956] the Gentiles. We also learned that we are moving now from law through grace. What a beautiful picture that was that day. Jesus took those purification water pots through which the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews took place. And he took out of that and performed
[time=2973] a miracle and he changed it into the new wine, which was presented to the governor. That's
[time=2979] what he did for us. He took our Christianity out of the, out of the old water of Judaism.
[time=2988] Our roots are back in Judaism. And he took it out of that and he brought it and performed a miracle over it. And he made it into Christianity in the person of his son, Jesus Christ. He
[time=2999] took the old water of Judaism and legalism and he made it into the new wine of Christianity.
[time=3006] And in the first chapter we read that the law came through Moses, but grace and truth
[time=3013] through Jesus Christ. And that's another picture that we see. Last but not least, there is
[time=3019] not just a doctrinal picture, not just a dispensational picture, there is a direct meaning to you.
[time=3027] Now let me see if I can explain what I mean. Here in this passage of scripture is a beautiful
[time=3036] unfolding of God's way as opposed to the world's way. A beautiful picture that you
[time=3042] must not miss. Whenever Jesus Christ comes into a life, whenever he comes into a situation,
[time=3049] it is always like turning water into wine. He always enhances it. He has as one man said
[time=3055] the uplifting touch, the upward look. There are some folks that you and I know that whenever they walk in a situation it's always to drag it down, but when Jesus walks into a situation it's always to lift it up and make it better than it was before. His touch is the upward touch. Now what is the way of the world? Well, when the governor of the feast made his analysis
[time=3076] of the new wine that had been brought to him, he said it better than I can. He said, every
[time=3082] man at the beginning sets forth the good wine. And then when men have well drunk, that which
[time=3089] is worse, but thou hast kept the good wine until now. Do you know that the way of the
[time=3095] world is just like that? That's the way the world does it. They give you all of the goodies
[time=3101] right up front until you get desensitized to it and then they bring all the dregs in. They
[time=3109] give you the better and all of a sudden you discover it's become bitter. Here's a man
[time=3117] who looks at a beautiful girl with a glass in her hand and it's good and tasteful to
[time=3125] be involved in the drinking of liquor and the drinking of alcohol and it just looks so wonderful. But where is that man when he is transisted from the better to the bitter?
[time=3136] You see him in a gut or some place, can't even control himself. What happened? Well,
[time=3142] he got hooked on the world's way. He took the better up front. But you know, that isn't
[time=3149] God's way. Someone has written about the ways of the world, a little poem that goes like this. Pleasures are like poppies spread. You seize them and the bloom is shed. Or like
[time=3163] the snow that falls in the river, a moment white, then it melts forever. Or like the
[time=3170] Borealis race that flits, or you can point their place, or like the rainbows, lovely form, evanishing amid the storm. That's what it is. You reach out to get it. You think
[time=3181] it's the best thing in all the world and then all of a sudden at the last it turns into bitterness. Oh, but that's not the way of Jesus. Whatever Jesus touches, whatever he's
[time=3192] involved in, it always gets better. Isn't that true? I can think through that with you
[time=3198] in a number of ways in the creation. On the last day, he created the epitome of his creation.
[time=3207] And you know sometimes it works almost exactly opposite in the life of people today. Sometimes
[time=3213] the beginning of your experience with God is bitter. I had a letter this week from a man who sits in our services. I don't know who he is, who explained the awful agony of his soul as the gospel is preached. And he realizes that he needs Christ and he cannot
[time=3229] deal with it in his own life and his bitterness and agony within him. I just want so badly
[time=3235] to say to that man, if you'll just go through that and accept Christ and let that conviction rest on your soul, that bitter will become better. Everything about the Lord is like that.
[time=3247] He always saves the best wine till last. And you know I'm looking forward to the day when the culmination of all of that is going to take place and I'm with him over in the book
[time=3258] of Proverbs. The writer of Proverbs has a wonderful way of expressing that. In Proverbs,
[time=3265] he says, "The path of the just is like the shining light that shineth more and more unto
[time=3274] the perfect day." That's the way it is with God. It just gets better and better and better.
[time=3281] That's the Lord's way. That's the world's way. Some of you have tried it the world's way. And you thought you were getting everything there was to have, that it was all going to be what it was up front. And now you're going through the bitterness of it. You thought that relationship was going to be the thing that would bring meaningful existence to your life. You thought that person, that drug, that habit, that place. And you looked at it and
[time=3307] you took it all and now the bitterness is just draining you dry. I want to tell you something.
[time=3314] Jesus Christ wants to do a miracle in your life. He does. And He'll take what you are.
[time=3322] And with the same miracle working power that He used to change water into wine, He'll change
[time=3328] you and make you new if you'll let Him. Shall we pray? Our heads are bowed and our eyes
[time=3337] are closed. And before we say goodbye to our friends at home, let me say this. If you don't
[time=3343] know Jesus Christ as your Savior, if you've not trusted Him, maybe you're going through that bitterness we've talked about. You've had all of that experience that you thought was going to make a difference. And now you realize that you've gone down the wrong road.
[time=3358] Bow your head where you are. Say, Lord Jesus, I've sinned. I want your saving grace to come
[time=3365] into my life. Forgive me for my sin and save me for Jesus' sake. And He'll come in. And
[time=3372] He'll take away your sin. He'll make you over anew into a new creature. You can do that right now, right where you are. Just pray that prayer. And if you do that, let us know so that we can help you and send some material that will get you started in your growth.
[time=3386] Do it today, while the opportunity is yours. Here in our auditorium.
