[time=4] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=13] [MUSIC]
[time=39] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=43] We're glad to welcome you to this service, all of you who have just come in and those of you who have been able to get here a bit early, the second hour of worship here at
[time=54] the Black Hawk Baptist Church is very special to us because you're here and also because we have the opportunity to share this with our many friends at home by way of television.
[time=64] We thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today and we trust that it will be a time of great blessing for you and your family and those who have gathered with you.
[time=73] First of all, we're going to listen to the ministry of our choir as they sing a song that is not new to any of us who have been in the church for even a short period of time.
[time=81] It is a beautiful presentation of amazing grace.
[time=85] Listen to the ministry of our choir.
[time=89] [MUSIC]
[time=106] Amazing grace, the spring, the sun, and say the rest I gave.
[time=123] My love was lost, but now and now, was blind from now and see.
[time=141] Was grace had gone by more to fear and breaks my fears relieved?
[time=159] The precious name that brings the being, the all-right words we bring.
[time=176] [MUSIC]
[time=194] His grace had gone, his faith was gone, and grace will lead me home.
[time=213] His grace had gone, his life was gone, and grace was gone, and grace was made to the
[time=240] all-right words we bring, and grace was made to the all-right words we bring, and grace
[time=262] was made to the all-right words we bring, and grace was made to the all-right words
[time=268] We have many good friends here in the Fort Wayne area, and certainly one of our good
[time=278] friends in the ministry of the gospel is Radio Station WBCL, which is owned and operated
[time=284] by the Fort Wayne Bible College, and we certainly extend to them and all of the personnel who are part of that station are congratulations for a very successful share-a-thon which was
[time=295] just completed this week, we're so very grateful that we could have a small part in the celebration by sending one of our musicians there to sing.
[time=303] I turned the radio on to listen to the share-a-thon and lo and behold, the soloist was our own star, Narwald, and we're glad that star sings for us and shares her ministry with others.
[time=314] It's awful difficult for us to get her to sing the music that she has written, I suppose that's a sense of humility on her part, but she has written some very beautiful songs and this little worship chorus that she wrote is one of my favorites.
[time=327] It's called simply Father God.
[time=354] My Father God, dear Father God, it took so long for me to see how much you love me,
[time=371] even when your Holy Spirit, I breathe, Father God, my only Father God, your everything
[time=383] from me, the Bible says that all have sinned, no man can pay the price, but through the
[time=397] blood of your precious son, eternal life is mine through Christ.
[time=405] This gift of love on the wings of a dove, you offer to every man.
[time=413] So my Spirit is free heavens, my destiny, thank you Father for loving me.
[time=424] So when I pray to you each day, I know before I start that you listen to me so fairly tenderly
[time=439] as I pour out what's in my heart.
[time=444] So in love I proclaim the righteousness of your name, through the ages your glory shall
[time=452] ring, and with joy I will sing I'm the child of the King, my Lord of lords to thee I cling.
[time=466] Father God, Father God, that's who you are to me, my Father God, dear Father God, it took
[time=480] so long for me to see how much you love me, even when your Holy Spirit, I grieve, Father
[time=495] God, my only Father God, I'll praise your name, through eternal life.
[time=521] We're glad that you've joined us for the Bible Hour today, and I know you've already appreciated
[time=550] the music, we have some more good music for you in just a few moments.
[time=553] Stephen Maria will be singing, right now Don and I have the opportunity to sit together and talk to you about the things that well are most important to you as you share the Bible Hour right there in your own home.
[time=566] During this time I have the opportunity to encourage you in your daily Bible study, and one of the reasons that I do that is because I know it's so very vital to your own spiritual life and growth, to the life and growth of your family.
[time=579] Now it's one thing to encourage someone to read the Bible, it's quite another thing to provide a plan of action that will help them to do it, and after a great deal of thought and research into the best method to use we have put together a program which we believe is very helpful and will uniquely bless you in your own life, it's called the Daily Walk.
[time=598] Now the Daily Walk is a plan that gets you into the Word of God every single day of your life and helps you to read the Bible through in a year's time.
[time=607] The Daily Walk comes to you from the Bible Hour office and it comes each month in the mail with a plan for you for that particular month to get you into some particular section
[time=617] of the scripture.
[time=618] For instance those who are reading it now are in the book of Leviticus and studying together some of the Old Testament truths that are so very helpful.
[time=626] One of the new additions to the Daily Walk this year is a little extra help called the extra mile.
[time=633] It's a chart that comes in the book that you receive that helps you to relate the truth you're studying to your daily experience, a place for you to check off some of the things that you'll be studying and then figure out how that relates to your life and how you can make those improvements that God would have you to make in your own personal experience.
[time=651] The Daily Walk is an excellent way to help you get started to read the Bible with understanding
[time=657] and it's our real privilege to provide that to you as you get in touch with us, we're happy to send it to your home.
[time=665] When you inquire about the Daily Walk there's a very simple way for you to do it.
[time=670] Just go to your phone, pick up the phone and call this number 1-800-453-9000 and when you
[time=678] call that number ask the operator for the Bible Hour office and tell her that you'd like to receive your copy of the Daily Walk and we'll send you your copy and information on how to receive it in your home each and every month and it'll be our joy to do it.
[time=693] So before you forget it write that number down and then as soon as you can go to the phone and call asking for the Daily Walk.
[time=700] The number is 1-800-453-9000 and honey we are still getting a number of requests each
[time=706] week for our little booklet Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions and this is just a collection of scripture verses dealing with folks who are lonely and I know in recent days we've
[time=717] run into so many people and had phone calls from many individuals who have said how helpful this booklet has been and the times of distress that they've been going through and loneliness.
[time=728] If you would like to have a free copy of Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions you may receive that also by calling our toll free number.
[time=736] That number again is 1-800-453-9000 and if you have a friend who is perhaps having a
[time=744] difficult time and you would like to have an extra copy for them just request two and we'll be happy to send them to you or if you prefer you may write to us we are always happy to receive your letters and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah Post Office
[time=759] Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=765] Donna before we go back to the service this morning I want to take just a moment to make a special plea and encouragement to the friends who are watching the Bible Hour for the very first time we have just added a number of new areas where the Bible Hour is being seen
[time=780] and it is so very important that we hear from you folks some of you in Altoona, Pennsylvania some of you folks who are watching in the Dayton Springfield area or in Terrehold, Indiana or in some of the other outlying areas where the Bible Hour is now being viewed will you get in touch with us and let us know that we're on and that you're seeing us and that the Bible Hour is meeting and eating your life we would be so very pleased if you'd sit down today and drop us a card or a letter and let us know that you're a part of the growing and we trust not just numerically but spiritually the growing Bible Hour family.
[time=813] When you write be sure to write to me Pastor David Jeremiah Post Office Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=819] Now in just a few moments I'm going to preach the second message in the series of messages that I've been preaching on the great signs of John's Gospel.
[time=828] The Savior and the Senator's Son is the title of today's message and I hope you'll be with us as we open the Word of God in just a few moments.
[time=853] There are times when I wonder what you see in me.
[time=867] Lord I know I'm not all that I could hold to be.
[time=881] When you reach your hand of Lord, to mend and hear, I was moved by the love that you must
[time=901] be by my miracle Lord, I'm a miracle Lord, I'm a miracle Lord because of you.
[time=930] I will give you the praise, I'm a miracle Lord because of you.
[time=957] I was lost to the thrill of sin and bound to die, but because of your plan for me you
[time=977] heard my cry, and then you came in response to prayer and ease the grave, so I won't
[time=998] live the rest of life in vain, I'm a miracle Lord.
[time=1014] I'm a miracle Lord, I'm a miracle Lord because of you.
[time=1034] You're the rest of my days, I will give you the praise, I'm a miracle Lord because of
[time=1054] you, I'm a miracle Lord, I'm a miracle Lord because of you.
[time=1080] Thank you David, that was David Miller reminding us all that while we're studying miracles
[time=1092] in the Gospel of John, we who are knowing Christ as our Savior are all miracles.
[time=1097] The miracle of the new birth is being wrought every day in the lives of men and women.
[time=1102] Sometimes when Jesus performed miracles he reached out and touched people and they were
[time=1108] healed, happened to Peter's mother-in-law to the man born blind, he made clay out of
[time=1117] spittle and put it on his eyes and came into physical contact with the individual.
[time=1123] Sometimes he just spoke a word and they were healed.
[time=1125] All of us who know Christ as our Savior know that there was a time in our lives when he touched us, he literally touched us spiritually and made us new.
[time=1133] Oh it wasn't a physical touch then, the finger of God did not come down from heaven and literally
[time=1139] pressed itself upon us, but the touch was just as genuine as if God had been there himself
[time=1145] in person and put his hand upon our life.
[time=1148] I'm certain that that must have been part of what was in the mind of Bill Gather when he wrote the song he touched me.
[time=1155] It is blessed and encouraged our hearts over the years and probably is the most famous of all of the music that he has written.
[time=1162] We're so glad that Stephen Maria are part of our team and with us now and they're going to sing their rendition of Bill Gather's "He Touched Me."
[time=1192] Knees the load of guilt and shame.
[time=1202] Then the hand of Jesus touched me and now I am no longer the same.
[time=1218] He touched me, oh yes he touched me and all the joy that floods my soul.
[time=1241] And now I know he touched me and made me whole.
[time=1259] Since I met this blessed Savior, since he cleansed and made me whole, I will never cease to
[time=1280] praise him, I'll shout it while he turns a dear rose.
[time=1293] He touched me, oh yes he touched me and all the joy that floods my soul.
[time=1310] Something happened and now I know he touched me and made me whole.
[time=1335] Thank you Stephen Maria for sharing that with us.
[time=1350] Now we're going to open our Bibles today and we're going to turn together to John chapter 4, the Gospel of John the fourth chapter.
[time=1360] And in just a moment we're going to stand together and read the Scripture out loud and that's a good thing for us to do.
[time=1367] I think there are two good reasons for that first of all, when I make you stand up you get awakened and that's always good for all of us.
[time=1374] Secondly, when you read the Scripture out loud there's a way in which it makes a better impact upon your mind.
[time=1382] My wife was sick last week and couldn't be a part of our service and she watched it on television and when I got home the first thing she said was when you read the Scripture together you go too fast and I couldn't understand anything you were saying.
[time=1394] So we're going to slow down and we're going to read it with dignity and so everybody can
[time=1400] understand it and you follow in your Bibles.
[time=1403] If you don't have the same translation I have you just do the best you can.
[time=1408] I've got the inspired version and we're going to read it together out loud.
[time=1411] Let's all stand shall we?
[time=1414] John chapter 4 and we're reading beginning at verse 46, read together.
[time=1419] So Jesus came again into cana of Galilee where he made the water wide and there was a certain
[time=1428] nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
[time=1433] When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee he went unto him and besought
[time=1440] him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death.
[time=1448] Then said Jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.
[time=1457] The nobleman sayeth unto him sir come down before my child died.
[time=1464] Jesus sayeth unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believe the word that Jesus
[time=1473] had spoken unto him and he went his way.
[time=1477] And as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth.
[time=1487] Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to improve and they said unto him yesterday
[time=1495] at the seventh hour the fever left him.
[time=1499] So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him thy son liveth
[time=1508] and he himself believed and his whole house.
[time=1512] This is again the second miracle that Jesus did when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.
[time=1521] Shall we remain standing for prayer?
[time=1524] God in heaven thank you for this accurate record of this great event in the life of our Lord and for the wonderful truth that is there for us to learn.
[time=1535] We pray that you will give us insight into the meaning of this miracle and into its application
[time=1541] to our own lives.
[time=1542] We thank you that God is in the business of doing miracles in the lives of men and women for the miracle of the new birth is being translated in the lives of people every day.
[time=1553] Thank you for this illustration and this picture and this wonderful presentation in Jesus name I pray amen.
[time=1567] As we open our Bibles today to this miracle Jesus Christ has now come to Galilee on his
[time=1574] return from Jerusalem.
[time=1576] In your Bibles in the fourth chapter in the beginning of the fourth chapter you will notice that the Lord decided that he would leave Judea and depart again unto Galilee chapter
[time=1587] 4 verse 3 and in order to get to Galilee from Judea if you know your Palestinian geography
[time=1595] it was necessary for Jesus Christ to go through Samaria and so he left Judea on his way to
[time=1601] Galilee and on his way through Samaria he encountered the woman of Samaria and so all
[time=1607] of the previous part of the fourth chapter of the gospel of John is taken up with what happened to Jesus when he was on his way to Galilee from Judea and he stopped in Samaria
[time=1619] and met the woman at the well.
[time=1621] Now we come to the end of the fourth chapter and in verse 46 we're told that he finally has arrived now at his destination he has come again into cana of Galilee where he made
[time=1633] the water wine.
[time=1634] Now in the 54th verse of the fourth chapter we're told that this is again the second miracle
[time=1641] that Jesus did when he was come out of Judea unto Galilee it was the second miracle that
[time=1648] fit the description at the end of that verse the second miracle that he did when he went out of Judea and he came into Galilee the first miracle being the one we studied last week when he made the water into wine.
[time=1662] Now it is never an accident in the word of God that things are brought together in juxtaposition so that we can compare and contrast them when Jesus said this is the second miracle he opens
[time=1673] our minds to study it in relationship to the first miracle though we do not have time to
[time=1679] give great effort in that direction this morning there are a number of things that will help us to understand the miracle if we will study them together.
[time=1688] First of all there are six or seven comparisons between this miracle and the one we studied last week interestingly enough both of them happened on the third day according to the scripture in both of these miracles the Lord is involved in rebuking the one upon whom
[time=1704] the miracle is to be a benefit he rebuked to his mother Mary and he said what is that
[time=1710] to me in this story he rebukes the nobleman because he is seeking signs and wonders in
[time=1716] both of these miracles we discover that we have the Lord involved with individuals who are obedient in their response when Jesus said to the servants at can of Galilee fill up the water pots with water they fill them up and when he said to this man go home thy
[time=1732] son liveth he went home in both miracles there was an obedient response in both of
[time=1738] these miracles it was the word of the Lord that was the agent in the miracle in the marriage
[time=1744] feast at can of Galilee it was the word of the Lord to the servants to fill up the water pots with water and they became wine and in this miracle it was the word of the Lord to the servant to go home and his son would be alive in both of these miracles the result of the miracle was belief in the first miracle we're told that the result of the changing of the water into wine was that the disciples believed on Jesus in this miracle we're told
[time=1770] that the result of the healing of the nobleman was that he and his family believed on Jesus
[time=1776] both of these miracles contain an incidental statement about the servants that I find most
[time=1782] interesting when the water that was made wine was born to the governor of the feast the scripture
[time=1788] says he knew not whence it came and then adds this very interesting detail but the servants
[time=1794] knew when the man who was going back home to find his son healed was halfway home the servants
[time=1802] came out and told him it's already done your son is alive in both instances the servants
[time=1808] knew last but not least it's interesting to note that both of these miracles the first
[time=1814] two Jesus ever worked in this particular setting were miracles of the home in one he restored
[time=1821] joy to a feast in another he restored a son to health and those are the comparisons but
[time=1828] there are some contrast that are interesting as well the first miracle was done at a marriage feast in a context of joy and happiness and excitement this second miracle was done at
[time=1839] a time of great sorrow when a young lad was about to die the first was the joy of a family
[time=1846] the second was the sorrow of a family the first gives us a picture of Christ and life's gladness
[time=1853] and the second gives us a picture of Christ and life's sadness and isn't it interesting to note that he is equally at home in both situations in times of great gladness he is there with joy in times of great sadness he is there with help the one was a picture of
[time=1870] hopelessness and helplessness and the other was a picture of joy and excitement now there
[time=1876] are many people who have studied the word of God far longer than I have who believe that this particular miracle is another version of a miracle recorded in mark or Matthew and Luke which we have come to understand and come to know as the healing of the centurion's son and there are some comparisons but men and women when you study those two stories side by side you discover that there are so many differences that they could not possibly be the same miracle this is a unique and individual situation in which Christ worked his miracle
[time=1907] working power in behalf of a man who had a great need now as we follow our way through
[time=1913] this story it's interesting to see how God worked in the life of this man to bring about
[time=1920] what he needed we begin first of all in verse 46 with Jesus Christ and a great sorrow Jesus
[time=1929] Christ and a great sorrow the scripture tells us that the man involved in the story was a
[time=1935] nobleman now the word nobleman is a word from the Greek language which we pronounce basilicus
[time=1941] it means a king's man a man who belonged to the king the official in this story was most
[time=1947] likely a Jew for he had attended the feast that took place at the Passover as recorded
[time=1953] in the second chapter he was a man who was a senior civil servant in the court of Herod
[time=1960] Tetrarch or Herod Antipas as he's called in history he was a man of great status a man of great
[time=1966] prestige a man of great wealth a man of great power he could have easily have been comparable
[time=1973] to a senator in our culture today therefore i've titled this message the savior and the senator's son now he worked for a man who became notorious in the history of the new testament because he was
[time=1988] the Herod who took off John the Baptist head Herod Antipas is the man who delivered John the Baptist
[time=1994] head on a platter we don't know too much else about him but we don't need to know too much more about him to to put him in a position of great jeopardy as far as his exercising his own faith
[time=2004] if he worked for a man like that the nobleman was high up in the government a man of great
[time=2011] aware with all to get accomplished anything that he needed but how empty was the pomp and circumstance
[time=2018] of the royal courtroom when through the halls of the palace came the cries of his young son who was
[time=2025] delirious with fever and was at a point of death the voice of his son was heard morning and evening
[time=2031] as he cried out in his sickness and somehow in the midst of that context all that this man had by
[time=2037] way of position and prestige and power was meaningless for the scripture says his son
[time=2044] was sick at Capernaum the imperfect tense in the verse here tells us that this young boy had been
[time=2051] sick for a long time and his sickness had gotten worse and worse and worse and so in verse 47 he
[time=2059] tells the lord that his son is at the point of death here was a man who had it all but is it not
[time=2067] interesting that sickness puts us all at the same level a Hubert Humphrey can be in a place of great
[time=2074] honor and respect but when sickness strikes he is no different than anyone else a marvellaby
[time=2080] can be much loved and respected as the wife of a senator but when sickness strikes she is no
[time=2086] different than anyone else i'm sure that's why there is an old Arab proverb that says this
[time=2092] that grief is a black camel that kneels down at everyone's gate and that's true here was a man
[time=2099] who had it all the bible gives us ample illustration of other noble men who had everything the world
[time=2106] could offer but a need came they could not meet and it was that need that caused them to reach out
[time=2112] for the lord now in the gospel of john up until the place where we are today there are three encounters
[time=2118] that our lord has with individuals in the third chapter he encounters nicodemus who came out of
[time=2125] intellectual inquisition spiritually he was not very far along but he had a curiosity about him
[time=2131] and he and he came to see jesus to see what he could do to inherit eternal life and jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god in the fourth chapter which we mentioned earlier there was a woman to whom jesus spoke as he met her by the well and it was her
[time=2147] immorality and her loose living that caused her to be convicted and she was brought to christ
[time=2153] but here in this story which we are studying today we have the cry of a desperate concerned
[time=2159] father a man who walked almost 20 miles from capernium to cana to seek the help of a carpenter
[time=2166] custom and convention were put aside what he cared about his position and seeking help from
[time=2173] such a low level was of no means to him he had a great need and he reached out to his lord
[time=2180] it has been a well overwhelming to me as i have listened to the testimonies of individuals who
[time=2186] have come to christ through the ministry here most of them as we hear them in our baptismal service to learn how often god has allowed tragedy and sorrow and divorce and hurt and pain and death
[time=2200] to come into the lives of individuals in order that they might be drawn to christ in the early service this morning a young lady came to christ who heard the gospel as i preached
[time=2212] it at a funeral and was drawn to christ and thursday night accepted the lord isn't it interesting
[time=2218] that sometimes god allows the hurts of life to open the door of our heart so that we will listen
[time=2225] to what he has to say so it was with this nobleman he was in a place of great responsibility
[time=2233] but god allowed his son to get sick and because of that he sought the lord
[time=2240] may i remind you that last week we opened the door to the miracles
[time=2246] and we underline this truth in all of our minds that if we have no need there will be no miracle
[time=2255] the difficulty with most people i meet today is they have great need they just don't know it they aren't aware of it they think they're rich but they're poor they think they have it all together but in essence there's a great vacuum in their life happy is the man whose outward circumstances
[time=2271] begin to conform to his inward life so that he begins to realize that he has a need and he reaches
[time=2277] out to god who alone can solve the problem here was a man of great sorrow we noticed
[time=2284] secondly in this story not only jesus christ and the great sorrow but jesus christ and the great
[time=2290] salvation the sorrow opened the door to christ the man swallowed his pride and he went where he
[time=2298] could get help his journey from where he was to where he needed to be started with sorrow but the
[time=2304] second step was the step of sincerity the scripture says that when he heard that jesus was come out of
[time=2311] judia into gallily he went unto him and he besought him that he would come down and the words
[time=2317] besought there are translated from a language that's that means he kept on asking over and over again
[time=2323] lord come down come down and he was persistent he wouldn't stop and the interchange that he had
[time=2330] between himself and the savior is most amazing in fact when you read it at first blush you can hardly believe the savior really said what is recorded here here was a man who was hurting his son was about to die he came to the lord for help and he said lord come down my son's going to die and jesus looked him right in the eye and he said no reason you're here is because of signs and wonders that doesn't sound like my lord doesn't sound compassionate at all i can't imagine someone
[time=2357] coming to me with a hurt like that and saying pastor will you pray for me and my responding by saying the only reason you come around here is to take up my time and to be a part of my office at all i can't imagine ever doing that but the lord said it and i want you to know why he said it
[time=2373] notice first of all that when he said that he did not say it singularly he said it plurally except ye receive signs and wonders you will not believe and if you go back up into
[time=2385] the 45th verse of this chapter you understand what the lord was driving at for then he was come into Galilee the Galileans received him having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at
[time=2396] the feast for they went to the feast the Galileans were signs and wonder followers they went down to
[time=2403] Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover where the lord had performed many miracles and they were impressed with what he could do they heard about the miracle at the marriage feast at can of Galilee
[time=2415] and they were impressed they were seeking jesus for the wrong reason and if you'll go back and study the second chapter of the gospel of john you'll discover that when jesus did all of those miracles surrounding the Passover that he would not commit himself to the people for he knew what was in man
[time=2431] and he knew that the only reason they were following him was so they could see the great outpouring of signs and wonders and they cared nothing for him as a person and for his power and so jesus used
[time=2442] this illustration where that man was who came to get his son healed and he spoke to the whole crowd and he said you're just seeking signs and wonders that's all you care about but i want you to notice
[time=2452] it did not discourage the nobleman he didn't rebuff him he didn't dialogue with him he didn't answer
[time=2459] him back notice what he said he moved now from sincerity to simplicity and he said in verse 49
[time=2467] sir come down before my child dies in essence he was saying lord i don't have time to debate the
[time=2476] motivation for my being here i may not be here for the right reason i may not have all of this
[time=2482] together intellectually theologically and all the rest of it but i know one thing i've got a hurt and you're the only one who can help me it's interesting the tenderness in the
[time=2492] passage he said come down air my child in the word child there is my little lad come down before my
[time=2500] little boy dies i don't know if you can remember some of you had your children so long ago you may
[time=2506] have forgotten all those tender times but uh seems like almost every week i have a reminder of how helpless little children are when they get sick and i sure do identify with this man
[time=2517] son lay there on the couch in a fever he tried everything he knew how to do to get him well
[time=2524] and nothing worked he just could see him degenerating he was getting worse and worse and worse and he
[time=2533] came to see the lord and the lord said to him you may not be here for the wrong reason he said lord i don't want to talk about that my son's dying just just come and help me just come and help me i remember more than one time bundling up my little ones and taking them to the emergency room
[time=2548] because i didn't know how to get the fever down how to get them back where they ought to be and there's an awful path awesome that this young child who was sick but you know this man was so concerned he didn't care if he was even there for the wrong reason
[time=2566] the one thing he knew was he had a need and that need was so great it just overwhelmed him you know that's the way it is when you get under conviction for sin i've watched that in the lives of people when god through his holy spirit begins to convict
[time=2581] them in their heart for their need of christ they don't care whether you're supposed to come
[time=2587] forward to go backward they don't know if you raise your hand or put it down they just know one thing there's something wrong inside and they can't fix it and they've got to get to god who can
[time=2598] the simplicity of it all there is a simplicity in our faith that honors the lord and i want you to
[time=2605] notice that he is sorrow eventuated in his sincerity and then into his simplicity and finally into his
[time=2613] surrender now notice what the lord said to him jesus said unto him verse 50 go your way your son lives
[time=2621] now we learned something about this man that's important he had some faith in the lord but it
[time=2629] wasn't perfect he'd already figured out that the lord could do most anything except two things he couldn't heal at a distance and that's why he wanted to get the lord where his son was he didn't
[time=2639] think the lord could handle Capernaum from cana and so he said lord if you don't come down and i thought about that most of the time when we go to the lord for a miracle we have such a tremendous need and we say we're helpless until we pray then we tell the lord how to do it isn't that right lord i got to have this miracle and here's what i want you to do and here's how you
[time=2659] do it if that isn't ridiculous i mean if if we can't help ourselves what right do we have to dictate
[time=2665] to the lord how he's going to do it this man believed the lord could heal but he'd already decided how it was going to take place and he needed to get the lord from cana to capernaum the second thing that we notice about this man was that he felt like if death happened to this young boy it was all over he said come down here my child die in the essence of it is if my child
[time=2684] dies there's no hope he didn't know about Lazarus yet because that doesn't happen till chapter 11
[time=2691] but if he knew the lord like you and i know the lord he would have known that the lord is not overwhelmed by death he has the power of death as well as the power of life
[time=2701] but give the man credit when the lord told him what to do he surrendered now notice the lord said
[time=2708] go home or go thy way thy son liveth now when the lord said this to this young man this nobleman
[time=2717] he put him in an awful dilemma let me see if i can explain what i mean if he took jesus at his word if he went home he would go home without any tangible evidence
[time=2731] that his need was going to be met he didn't carry any hankies back with him didn't carry any point of contact back with him he just went home if he went home he had to go
[time=2745] and blind faith in the bare word of god if he decided not to go home but to see if he could wait
[time=2752] and get the lord to go with him then in the face of the one in whom his old trust was
[time=2758] he was insulting him he was saying lord no i'm not going to go home i don't believe you i'm going to stay here to you he was in an awful dilemma and when he exercised his faith and he went home he gives to us an illustration of what saving
[time=2774] faith is that's perhaps as good as any you'll find in all of the bible all over this world there are men and women who believe that jesus christ is capable of saving them
[time=2785] from their sin and taking them to heaven they believe it in their minds but the lord says
[time=2791] if you don't believe if you don't receive me you can't be a christian they go on accepting the fact that he can do it but they never go on their way and translate their faith into action
[time=2803] to give evidence that their faith is real may i say to you if this man had stayed in cana and he
[time=2809] said lord i believe you can do that i really believe you can do it but i'm not going home i'm going to stay here till you do it and word comes back that it's done that's not faith the lord said your son lives now you go home and praise god he went home
[time=2826] he did what the lord told him to do he believed he surrendered and he started home
[time=2832] now the result of this great salvation men and women was a great satisfaction
[time=2838] we have moved from the great sorrow to the great salvation to jesus christ in the great
[time=2845] satisfaction and these next verses are most interesting in verse 51 this man is now on his way home
[time=2853] and as he's going home as he's going down from cana to capernaum a journey of somewhere between 60
[time=2859] and 20 miles over some very rough and rugged mountainous terrain as he gets down toward home
[time=2865] his servants run out and they say to him thy son liveth now let me show you a very interesting
[time=2872] thing in the passage what the servants said to him was exactly what jesus said to him
[time=2878] jesus said go home thy son liveth that is the word of announcement the servant said thy son liveth
[time=2887] that's the word of accomplishment both of them are very important what the saviour said is fact
[time=2893] when the servant reports it back and uh the man who has believed is like many of us and like the
[time=2902] man in the new testament who said i believe lord helped our mind unbelief do you know what he said now you can read this it's very careful carefully put in the text but it's not translated even as exactly as it might be verse 52 said then he inquired of them the hour when his son and my
[time=2920] text says began to improve one of the translations puts it this way when he began to do better when he
[time=2926] began to do handsomely and so when the servants came out and told the nobleman that their that his
[time=2932] son was living he said when did he start getting better you see he also believed that the lord
[time=2940] couldn't heal just like that that the lord had to go through a recovery process you see that the lord would just sort of turn things around a little bit so the boys start to get better and that when he got home his son would be improving but the servants said at the seventh
[time=2956] hour what does it say the fever left him he got up out of bed like he'd had a long hard night in a
[time=2965] bad dream and he was a hundred percent better immediately there was no catechism no 10 weeks of
[time=2977] classes before he could be ready so many folks tell us when you get saved these days that it takes a
[time=2983] long time you first of all got to be taught then you're taken through a long catechismical process
[time=2991] and finally if you get all this information and you finally that finally you're safe it's not the way to happen to me i got on my knees one minute is a lost person and i got up the next minute is a safe person that's how it happened we see he hadn't figured this all out yet and i think
[time=3007] it's such a tremendous interchange when did he start getting better well he didn't start getting better he just got better that was the servants message now notice there's an interesting statement
[time=3020] here about the seventh hour and he said when did it happen he said well he got better at the seventh
[time=3026] hour and the father knew now that it was Jesus because he was with Jesus at the seventh hour when
[time=3033] Jesus said thy son liveth and the servants were back home in Capernaum and they were corroborating
[time=3039] the miracle because they were there at the seventh hour and they knew that what Jesus said in cana at the seventh hour is exactly what happened in Capernaum at the seventh hour and it was that that wonderful coincidence that brought those two things together that caused
[time=3054] this man to say hello it's the lord now there's a great controversy in the study of this text as
[time=3063] to whether he was operating on roman time or jewish time and i really don't know whether it was
[time=3069] roman time or jewish time but if it was roman time it was the seventh hour roman time and the seventh hour roman time and if it was jewish time it was the seventh hour jewish time and the seventh
[time=3080] hour jewish time the reason that it's such an interesting study is because the seventh hour roman
[time=3086] time well the seventh hour roman time is seven o'clock at night the seventh hour jewish time
[time=3093] is one o'clock in the afternoon if jesus spoke the word of his son's life at seven o'clock at night
[time=3100] you can understand why the man stayed all night in cana and that's what the scripture says because
[time=3106] it was the next day when his son was healed after he had talked to jesus if it was seven o'clock at
[time=3112] night you can see while he'd say well i'm not going to start back that long journey over those mountains until the morning so he slept all night if it's roman time i understand that i'll tell you if it's jewish time this man had a lot more faith than most of us because it won
[time=3126] o'clock the lord said it and he still had plenty of time to get home but he believed in the lord so much he decided to do a little shopping while he was in cana and he took a few moments to go around take care of few odds and ends and then the next morning he got up and he took a shower and he went home now i don't know whether it was jewish time or roman time but i do know this when the lord
[time=3145] said it over here it happened over here you know folks distance is no problem with my god
[time=3152] distance doesn't have anything to do with what he's done he can move through time and space without so much as a thought
[time=3166] well the scripture says in verse 53 that the result of this was that he believed and his whole family
[time=3174] thy son lived with he himself believed and his whole house
[time=3181] i suppose you think the greatest thing that happened in this story is the fact that this little boy didn't
[time=3188] die may i say to you that this boy was brought to the point of death in order that a whole household
[time=3196] might be brought to the point of life the greatest thing in this story wasn't that this little boy didn't die because the record is he did die one day he died and he went in his grave but he's not
[time=3207] going to stay there because someday when the resurrection comes he'll be up there in heaven
[time=3213] because the whole house believed this young boy was brought to the point of death that the whole
[time=3219] house might be brought to the point of life you may think that the thing the lord was doing most
[time=3225] important in this story was he was healing the boy's son but that's not true he was healing the man's soul that's the most important thing and he brought this man along in a very gentle way
[time=3238] through three stages of faith first of all the man believed in the power of the lord for he had seen the miracles and he had watched what the lord did at kanev Galilee and he'd heard all about these wonders and signs but then he moved out of the realm of faith in the power of the lord and now he
[time=3254] believed in the proclamation of the lord when the lord said go home he went home that's another kind of faith and that's important but when we find him down here at the end of this chapter he has put his faith in the person of the lord the scripture says he believed in the lord and his
[time=3270] whole house that's the way it happens every time someone hears about a person being saved or maybe
[time=3277] one of your family members get saved or your wife gets saved your husband gets saved and all of a sudden he began to see the power of god in that person's life and you don't understand it he's different just different than he ever was before and you watch that and then someone brings you
[time=3293] alongside a preacher and you hear the word of the lord and you begin to believe that and then one day there's a time in your life when you translate all of this out of the power of the lord and the proclamation of the lord and you invite christ into your life and put your trust in the person of the lord that's what happened to this man and that's what this miracle teaches us that the word of the
[time=3315] lord is in order that we might know the person of the lord as our savior do you know him do you know
[time=3325] him is he yours has he made you new through the shed blood of his cross and caused you to become
[time=3333] a christian why don't you learn to know him and put your trust in him and believe him and surrender
[time=3339] to him and you can do it today shall we pray our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed for those
[time=3347] of you who are leaving us by way of television if you don't know christ why not will you put your
[time=3354] trust in him i'm not talking about head knowledge now i'm talking about inviting him into your heart and into your life making him your savior trusting him as your lord receiving him into your heart
[time=3365] right now wherever you are you can bow your head and say lord jesus i do have a need i'm a sinner
[time=3371] and i need the salvation which you alone can give and i invite you into my life and into my heart
[time=3377] and i accept you today you can do that right where you are and father may there be many who do that
