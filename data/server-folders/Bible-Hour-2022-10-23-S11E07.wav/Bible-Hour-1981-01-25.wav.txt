[time=9] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=15] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=20] [ Singing ]
[time=42] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=48] I'm happy to have you with us today here in the auditorium as we come together for the second morning worship service.
[time=55] And then all of you who have joined us now by television, we're glad that you're with us to share in this time of worship which comes from the auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=66] The theme for the first part of our service today is the second coming of Jesus Christ
[time=72] and the choir begins that theme as they sing for us a song entitled "Marinatha."
[time=78] Listen to the choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=82] [ Singing ]
[time=198] Thank you, choir.
[time=205] We have so many talented musicians in this church, and we just are blessed so much each week as we get a chance to share in their ministry.
[time=213] Those of you who watch the service from the auditorium see the Sunday morning service and we get all of that. In fact, I get it twice because we have two services and then on Sunday night we have the opportunity to hear more music from our various musicians.
[time=228] We're so grateful to God because we love music and we know it's one of the ways we praise the Lord and communicate His truth to men and women.
[time=236] We're happy that one of our husband and wife teams is going to sing for us now.
[time=240] Mr. Mrs. Al Peterson, you listen to their music as they continue the theme of the Second Coming of Christ.
[time=246] [ Singing ] Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for the judgment day?
[time=261] Are you ready, are you ready for the judgment day?
[time=273] What if this would be the year when Jesus comes?
[time=283] The year that we've been waiting for so long, we ask a little time to get our laws to run.
[time=305] If this would be the year that Jesus comes,
[time=318] the year that we've been waiting for so long,
[time=341] all the sudden time they're marching to the green's great foreign nation,
[time=352] and this could be the dawning of the day.
[time=363] All this could be the dawning of the grave for your stay.
[time=374] When the days of Jesus we behold,
[time=384] the dreams and hopes of all ages are awaiting his return.
[time=395] And this could be the dawning of the day.
[time=405] [ Singing ]
[time=512] [ Applause ]
[time=519] We're so glad that you've joined us on the Bible Hour today, normally Don and my wife, shares this time with me, but this is the flu season, as many of you know, and we have six chances at our house for someone not to be here, and when anybody but me isn't here on Sunday, that means Donna stays home too.
[time=538] All of you mothers at home understand that, I'm sure.
[time=541] And I want to take just a few moments to talk with you this morning about the extension of the Bible Hour Ministry into your home.
[time=549] This past week we had an all-time high number of requests for a very special booklet we've been offering during these past days, and we were just about ready to begin making another booklet available,
[time=563] but there are still many, many people that are writing and calling a special little booklet called Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely.
[time=572] As most of you know, this grew out of a series of messages that I preached several weeks ago on the subject of loneliness, and it is a compilation of the scriptures that deal with that very current problem.
[time=584] When the series of messages was preached, I called the series Loneliness, The Disease of the Decade, and I really believe that that's what it is.
[time=594] There are many, many people these days who are suffering from the sickness called loneliness.
[time=600] And I'm very excited to tell you that God has an answer to that need, and He has a message for all of you who may be experiencing that particular motion at this time.
[time=610] We'd like to send you this very special book that comes in three sections.
[time=614] First of all, the Psalms of the Old Testament that deal with the problem.
[time=618] Secondly, the promises found throughout all of the Bible that deal with the problem.
[time=622] And thirdly, some instruction from the Word of God in the form of Scripture verses that will help you to know what to do about the problem.
[time=630] This little booklet is yours.
[time=633] If you'll just call us, or write us, let us know that you'd like to have it for your own very own home, or to share it with a friend who may have this particular need.
[time=643] If you'd like to have this free booklet, all you need to do is go to your phone and call this number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=651] It is a toll-free call from any place here in the United States, and when you call, simply ask the Bible our operator for this special booklet called Psalms, Promises, and Prescriptions for the Lonely.
[time=664] And we will be happy to send it to you as soon as we hear from you and get your request.
[time=670] Now, of course, if you would like to write to us, we're happy to hear from you through the mail, and the address that you need to know in order to get in touch with us through the mail is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=684] Simply write and request this special booklet.
[time=687] And when you're writing, if you're not involved in the Daily Bible Study program, we'd like to encourage you to get involved in the Daily Walk.
[time=695] The Daily Walk is a program of Bible study that gets you into the word each day, and if you're faithful throughout a year's period of time, you will have read the entire Bible all the way through.
[time=706] We have been receiving in recent days letters from people who last year read the Bible through for their very first time.
[time=714] It's really a delight to sense the excitement, the sense of satisfaction, and the spiritual well-being that has come out of that exercise in the lives of many of our Bible our friends.
[time=725] We'd like to get you started, and you can start anytime and just go through the whole year's cycle, and you will have read the entire Bible.
[time=732] If you'd like to be enrolled in the Daily Walk program, simply get in touch with us and let us know.
[time=737] Once again, the phone number that you call for your copy of this free booklet or for the Daily Walk is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=747] And if you're writing, be sure to address your letter to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=755] We look forward to hearing from you this week because we want to help, and it's our desire to extend the ministry of the Bible our right into your home through printed literature and Bible study helps.
[time=767] Now stay with us as we continue with the Bible our today.
[time=770] Just a few moments I'm going to be opening the Word of God to the Gospel of John, preaching a message on the miracle of the paralytic at the pool.
[time=779] I think you'll enjoy what we have to learn from the Word of God today, and I trust that God will open your heart to His truth.
[time=789] [MUSIC] Jesus is the joy of my salvation [MUSIC] Jesus is the reason for my song [MUSIC] So don't you worry or sorry for me [MUSIC] When any little thing goes wrong [MUSIC] 'Cause I have Jesus [MUSIC] And He's my joy [MUSIC] I don't have to borrow my happiness [MUSIC] From any mood or feeling I may possess [MUSIC] My joy runs deeper than that [MUSIC] It's Jesus [MUSIC] The thrill I've done is bigger than the moment [MUSIC] It's a personal relationship that time can destroy [MUSIC] Jesus is my happiness [MUSIC] Jesus is my joy [MUSIC] Jesus is the joy of my salvation [MUSIC] Jesus is the reason for my song [MUSIC] So don't you worry or feel sorry for me [MUSIC] When any little thing goes wrong [MUSIC] 'Cause I have Jesus [MUSIC] And He's my joy [MUSIC] I have found the secret of happy living [MUSIC] For I've found the source of selfless giving [MUSIC] I've found the way to contend when it's Jesus [MUSIC] Taking up my cross to follow Him each day [MUSIC] Brings a sense of satisfaction as I trust and obey [MUSIC] Jesus is my happiness [MUSIC] Jesus is my joy [MUSIC] Jesus is the joy of my salvation [MUSIC] Jesus is the reason for my song â™ª
[time=928] So don't you worry, I'll be sorry for me, where any little thing goes wrong, 'cause I have Jesus and He's my joy. He's my joy. Jesus is my joy. My joy.
[time=958] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers. We appreciate your music, and we're going to ask some of the male members of the Black Hawk Singers just to stay put, because the quartet is going to sing in just a moment.
[time=969] While they're coming and preparing to sing, let me remind all of you that we are doing our very best to enroll all of God's children in a Bible reading program.
[time=980] Now, we don't have anything in mind except to get you into the Word, and there's a way you can do that through a program we call the Daily Walk.
[time=988] The Daily Walk is a monthly publication that comes out from our office and comes into your home.
[time=995] And as it comes into your home, it brings assignments for every day that you can read in the Bible. They tell me that even the slowest of readers can do it in 20 minutes.
[time=1006] And I can't do it in 20 minutes, because every time I get started, something dawns on me that I want to write down, and I go and write it down, so it takes me a little longer than that.
[time=1016] But if you're in a hurry, you can do it in 20 minutes. And in 20 minutes a day, if you stay with it for a whole year, you can read through the whole Bible.
[time=1023] And I would imagine there are a lot of folks listening to me who've never done that, but we've received letters in just recent days from folks who've been involved in the Daily Walk program
[time=1033] who for the first time in their life read the Bible all the way through. That's really been an encouragement to us.
[time=1038] Those of you here in the auditorium, if you are not involved in the Daily Walk and you don't receive it in your home through the mail, if you will let us know, and our office will be happy to let you know how you can be a part of that program.
[time=1051] And for our friends who are watching by television, there is a phone number on the screen right now that you can use, and if you'll call that number, someone will take your name and address and will send you a copy of the Daily Walk
[time=1062] and get you started in reading the Bible through. Now before the men sing, I have to tell you something that I've been waiting to do until after a certain engagement was completed.
[time=1074] Down in Texas, where the Dallas Cowboys are and where the Houston Oilers are, every year they have a game for what they call the bragging rights of Texas.
[time=1084] And here in our state, there are two churches that have schools where the pastors are friends. One of them is the Black Hawk Baptist Church where Pastor Jeremiah is, and the other is the Elkhart Baptist School where the pastor of the church is Mr. Dan Gillette.
[time=1100] And we really beat them badly early in the year, and I was going to say something about that, but I knew we had a return engagement, and I wanted to be sure that I really did have the bragging rights of Indiana before I did it.
[time=1113] And we finished it off on Friday, and we went to their place with their officials and won.
[time=1123] And last time we beat them early in the year, Pastor Gillette sent me a letter telling me that their whole team had the flu, and that's why we won.
[time=1132] And I want to say to him that our whole team had the flu, and that's why we only won by a few points this time.
[time=1138] But we did it, and next year's another year there's always hope that springs eternal in the human heart, and we'll give you the opportunity next year, all of you folks up in Elkhart.
[time=1148] And the reason I'm saying all this is because a lot of those folks watch this program on television, and I'm sure their pastor wouldn't tell them about the loss, and I needed to do it while I had opportunity.
[time=1159] The male quartet sings some great songs, and I just appreciate them so much. I think they're one of the best quartets I've ever heard. I'm a little prejudiced, but I really believe they do well, and they're singing a spiritual right now that I know you'll enjoy.
[time=1189] Jesus keeps me from a road.
[time=1204] I'll be satisfied as long as I walk, let me walk close to thee.
[time=1234] Just a closer walk with thee.
[time=1247] And it is us, if you believe.
[time=1257] They're walking close to thee.
[time=1266] Let it be.
[time=1269] Lord, let it be.
[time=1281] You, this will not all enhance.
[time=1290] If I falter, are you cares?
[time=1298] Oh, come with me, my burden share.
[time=1307] None but thee, dear Lord, none but thee.
[time=1318] Just a closer walk with thee.
[time=1328] Let it be, dear Lord.
[time=1347] Let it be, dear Lord, when my feeble life is old.
[time=1360] Let it be, dear Lord.
[time=1366] Guide me gently to thy show.
[time=1374] Let it be, dear Lord.
[time=1382] Let it be.
[time=1394] (Applause)
[time=1406] Well, apparently you agree with me that they're a pretty good quartet.
[time=1410] Thank you, men, for sharing with us.
[time=1412] And now I hope you brought your Bibles because we have to have a Bible here to understand what goes on in the service.
[time=1420] And I want you to take your Bible and turn with me to the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John.
[time=1425] John chapter five, and we're going to read together in just a moment, the first nine verses.
[time=1431] We are studying in our morning services the seven signs of John's Gospel.
[time=1440] In the 20th chapter, John tells us after finishing the writing of the book that these things are written that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.
[time=1452] And the signs which are here are part of the proof of His deity, and that's why we're studying them the way we are.
[time=1461] We come to the third miracle today, and it is recorded for us in John five, one through nine.
[time=1467] Now, in following the pattern of recent weeks, let us stand together.
[time=1470] Shall we to read the Word of God?
[time=1473] Everyone reading, and let's read aloud together.
[time=1477] After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[time=1483] Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep gate, a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.
[time=1494] In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, waiting for the moving of the water.
[time=1504] For an angel went down at certain season into the pool, and troubled the water,
[time=1511] whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole, of whatever disease he had.
[time=1519] And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity, thirty and eight years.
[time=1525] When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been thus now a long time, he saith unto him,
[time=1533] will thou be made whole?
[time=1536] The impotent man answered him, sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool.
[time=1544] But while I am coming, another stepeth down before me, Jesus saith unto him,
[time=1551] rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
[time=1555] And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.
[time=1561] And the same day was the Sabbath.
[time=1564] Now let us stay standing for prayer.
[time=1569] Lord Jesus, we have read from thy holy word, the inspired word of God,
[time=1576] God's revelation of himself to us.
[time=1580] And in this passage we see God revealed in the person of his son, the Lord Jesus, who came to declare him to us.
[time=1589] And we see a revelation of him that is unlike the others we have studied.
[time=1594] And we pray that as we open up the text and give the sense of the words,
[time=1602] God the Holy Spirit will cause the revelation of Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity,
[time=1609] to break in upon our consciousness in such a way that we will be drawn closer to him.
[time=1615] And if there be those who hear this message who do not know Jesus Christ, in the knowledge that is called salvation, may they come to know him today is my prayer.
[time=1626] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1635] This third miracle, which is recorded here in the Gospel of John, begins a whole new theme in John's Gospel.
[time=1645] It is the beginning of the unbelief and hostility that is leveled against the Lord as the result of his miracle working power.
[time=1657] In the first two miracles that we studied together, the result of God working through his son Jesus Christ,
[time=1664] the great miracles that he worked, the result of that was that there was belief.
[time=1670] For instance, in the marriage of Kaina of Galilee, when Jesus turned the water into wine, the Scripture says that the disciples believed on him.
[time=1679] And when he raised to health and strength, the nobleman's son, the Scripture says that that nobleman and his whole family believed on Jesus.
[time=1690] But here in this third miracle, the result of what Christ did for this impotent man at the pool of Bethesda,
[time=1698] the result is far different.
[time=1700] For here we are told that the Jews, because of what Jesus did that day, sought to kill him.
[time=1707] And from that moment on, he was the target of their hostility and opposition and disfavor.
[time=1715] This theme which begins here in the fifth chapter of John is not a theme which we have not had some exposure to.
[time=1723] Those of you who are studying with us the continuity of the Gospel in the evening services know that as we opened up the word and discussed together John's prologue,
[time=1732] recorded in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, that I mention to you that the prologue of John is as an overture,
[time=1740] that in that prologue there are the various themes that run throughout the Gospel.
[time=1746] It is like the beginning of many threads which we can trace through each chapter in the prologue which we studied last week in our evening service.
[time=1756] There are three statements concerning the hostility of the Jewish people toward the light or the word.
[time=1764] You'll remember them if you read the chapter and studied it with us.
[time=1768] The Scripture says in John 1 that Jesus Christ came into the world as the light, but the darkness comprehended it not.
[time=1777] That very same first chapter tells us that the world did not acknowledge him even though he came into the world.
[time=1784] And in the most poignant of all of the statements John tells us in the first chapter that he came unto his own home, to his own things,
[time=1795] and his own home and his own people received him not.
[time=1800] There is the first picture in that first chapter of the hostility toward Jesus Christ, and now here in the fifth chapter we see the beginning of that as the result of a miracle that Jesus did.
[time=1812] Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, a great expositor of the Word of God who has written extensively on this Gospel,
[time=1819] has said in one of his writings that on the human level, from human perspective, what Jesus did on this day, the day we're studying,
[time=1829] and what he said on this day cost him his life for the Jews never forgave him for healing a man on the Sabbath day.
[time=1839] And as you open your Bibles from this point on you can begin to trace the theme of unbelieve and opposition through this Gospel.
[time=1846] Join with me just briefly to see a couple of verses that will illustrate what I mean.
[time=1851] In the 38th verse of the fifth chapter, "And ye have not his word abiding in you, for whom he hath sent ye believe not."
[time=1862] And in the 36th verse of the sixth chapter, "But I said unto you that ye also have seen me, and ye believe not."
[time=1872] And the 47th verse of the seventh chapter then answered them the Pharisees.
[time=1878] Are ye also deceived? Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
[time=1884] The verse that expects a negative answer. And in the 59th verse of the eighth chapter, we have the same theme reoccurring.
[time=1892] Then took the upstones to cast at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by.
[time=1900] And I could multiply other verses from this point on, and especially is it intense in chapters 7 through 12 of John's Gospel.
[time=1908] And men and women, it all starts outwardly, at least, here in the fifth chapter of John, when Jesus restored health and wholeness to a man, and he did it on the Sabbath day.
[time=1923] The story of what incurred the wrath of the Jewish people is the story that we're going to study together today.
[time=1930] Now the Bible tells us that this event recorded here in the fifth chapter took place at a feast of the Jews.
[time=1937] The very first words of the fifth chapter give us that setting.
[time=1940] After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[time=1946] Now the Bible does not tell us what feast that was, and if you know anything at all about the Old Testament, you know the Jews had many feasts and the Holy Days.
[time=1954] We do know it was one of three feasts that the Bible teaches us about in the Old Testament.
[time=1959] It was either the feast of the Passover, or it was the feast of the Tabernacles, or it was the feast of Pentecost.
[time=1971] We know it was one of those three feasts because only those three feasts required the Jews to come to Jerusalem, and in the text we're told that it was a feast time, and the Jews came to Jerusalem for the feast.
[time=1983] So they were there for one of those three feasts.
[time=1986] And the Scripture tells us that this event which we are going to look at this morning took place inside of Jerusalem by the sheep gate.
[time=1994] Now I visited Jerusalem a few years ago, and I moved around the walls of the city of Jerusalem, and if you have been there, you know that there are several sets of walls because Jerusalem has been built up and destroyed many times.
[time=2008] And I remember vividly coming to a place called the sheep gate on the outward part of Jerusalem.
[time=2015] And it was at that particular gate where this miracle took place.
[time=2019] Now that gate is mentioned a couple of times in the book of Nehemiah, and there is some conjecture as to why it's called the sheep gate, but most people believe it's called the sheep gate because outside of that gate in the pasture lands outside was the place where the Jews took care of their flocks and their sheep.
[time=2036] And when they would bring them in to make them ready for food, they would bring them in through the sheep gate, and it is quite possible that even the pool that is there called Bethesda was a place for the ablution or for the washing of the sheep.
[time=2049] It was at the sheep gate, according to the text where this miracle took place.
[time=2054] Now today, if you were to go to Israel, you would not find a place called the pool of Bethesda, as it is called here.
[time=2062] It is now called the pool of St. Anne's, and there is a church there near that place called the pool of St. Anne's, and it's a beautiful place.
[time=2070] It's a double pool.
[time=2072] The scripture says here in the text that at that pool there were five porches.
[time=2077] Now the word porches will be understood in your mind if I use another word, and that's the word "colonade."
[time=2083] Do you know what a colonade is?
[time=2085] Why, if you've ever been to Rome, you have them everywhere.
[time=2088] Those huge columns that strut up into the sky and hold the porches.
[time=2093] And here at this pool, the scripture says there were five colonnades.
[time=2097] There were two pools and five colonnades.
[time=2100] It was called a pool, but it was a double pool.
[time=2103] There were two colonnades, one, two by each pool, and then there was one that divided the pools.
[time=2108] And if I could show you a picture of it today, why you would be so surprised.
[time=2113] Because when we talk about this pool, we all have in our minds a swimming pool.
[time=2118] Most of us, even smaller than that, may be a waiting pool.
[time=2122] But this was a gigantic place with huge colonnades all around it, and separating it bigger probably than this auditorium.
[time=2131] And the water inside, and it was at this place according to the scripture, that those who were blind and infirm and halt and withered and were sick beyond cure would come.
[time=2143] And there they would wait, hoping for some miracle to take place.
[time=2148] Now let me pause for just a moment.
[time=2150] I have been having a little bit of fun in the Gospel of John telling you some of the fanciful stories that come out of the great writers who have typically written about this book.
[time=2160] And this week I read some very interesting truth that you will never hear from any other source, and so I must share it with you.
[time=2168] One of the great allegorical writers on the book of John tells us that the five porches are the five books of Moses.
[time=2176] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and that those five books are pictures of the fact that this man gathered there at the Old Testament law and what the law could not do for him, Jesus Christ did.
[time=2189] Now wait a minute, that's not all.
[time=2191] And that this man who was 38 years old pictures the fact that the Jews wandered around in the wilderness for 38 years and it wasn't until the wanderings were over that they came to find real healing and hope in the land of Palestine.
[time=2203] Now that's a beautiful story, but can you imagine, and let me ask you, do you think John knew anything about that when he wrote this for us?
[time=2211] Why surely he did not?
[time=2213] And the only reason we come up with those kind of things is because we take all we know and we read it back into the text, and it might be all right to do that for a meditation, but it's pretty dangerous preaching, because after a while you forget what the text is really saying.
[time=2227] And so I'm not going to read all of that in, though there are some marvelous pictures that are obvious here in the text for us to see.
[time=2234] The first thing that I want you to notice is we open up this text and study it together is the pathetic assembly gathered at the pool.
[time=2243] The pathetic assembly gathered at the pool, we read about that in the first four verses.
[time=2248] At this great and gigantic pool called Bethesda, the scripture tells us there were a multitude of very interesting people.
[time=2258] Now if you were to go to that pool and do the study that has been done on it, you would discover that here these pools were fed by a bubbling spring.
[time=2266] It was sort of like a cultural spa, it was mineral water, and people came there like some of our folks go to the springs, hoping that there will be healing in the waters.
[time=2276] And this pool of Bethesda, which was gathered there, was a place where all of the sick people came.
[time=2282] Now listen to the way those folks are described. It tells us here in the text that there was a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind folk, of lame folk, of paralyzed folk, and they were waiting for the water to move.
[time=2296] The Bible teaches us that those descriptions of the physical condition of those individuals are very apt description of those who were without Christ.
[time=2306] Notice, here gathered at this pool were those who were without power, impotent, those who were without sight, blind, those who were without wholeness, lame, those who were without strength.
[time=2321] And in the book of Romans, the Bible teaches us that Jesus Christ came into this world to save those who were without hope and without strength and without any recourse except through Jesus Christ.
[time=2333] So here, while we're dealing with the physical healing of the impotent man and the setting of that impotent man among all of these who were so ill, we must not miss the lesson that this is a picture to us of a lost humanity without Christ,
[time=2348] who are without sight and without wholeness and without hope and without help.
[time=2359] Here, gathered at this pool, was that great congregation of the infirm.
[time=2365] For a moment, imagine with me our Savior coming to that place, walking among those people,
[time=2376] walking past the blind man over here who was groping to reestablish his position, walking past another man over here who was a bundle of frayed nerves trembling there on his palate,
[time=2391] walking past another man over here who's blind, talking with someone next to him who was withered, walking in and among them, buy them close enough to reach out and touch them until he comes to one.
[time=2407] Is that not a picture of this day in which we live when a world that is lost without sight, without hope, without help, without wholeness?
[time=2423] Carries on their day-to-day activities as the Savior in the life of his church, the Christian, walks among them, and the Scripture says that even the man he healed did not know who he was.
[time=2437] He came unto his own and his own received him not, he was not known, though he was the hope of their life, and though if one of those would have known who he was, they could have reached out and grabbed hold of him
[time=2452] as the woman who touched the hem of his garment and was healed, they did not because they knew not.
[time=2461] But Jesus Christ had his attention focused on one among the many.
[time=2467] And we move from the pathetic situation to the pessimistic, paralytic, for the Scripture says in verses 5 through 7 that one of the men who was there at the pool was a man in firm.
[time=2483] He was an adult. The Bible tells us very quickly that he was 38 years old. He no doubt was well known in the community.
[time=2493] I believe that's one of the reasons the Lord chose him to work that miracle on him. He wanted it to be worked on someone whose infirmity was well established so the miracle could be well established.
[time=2505] This 38 year old adult was the most needy, the most helpless, the most miserable. A blind man could stumble his way into the pool if the waters were troubled.
[time=2518] A man who was lame could hop into the pool if the waters were troubled, but a man who was paralyzed and infirm and impotent could do nothing but lay there upon his cot, hoping against hope that someone would take mercy on him and help him get to the water.
[time=2534] But alas, as the Lord addresses him, we discover that there was no man who cared for his soul.
[time=2540] I believe one of the reasons the Lord chose this man to perform his miracle was to demonstrate that there is never anyone who is without hope.
[time=2550] There is never anyone who is too far gone for God to work in his life. Never anyone who is so helpless, so hopeless that Christ cannot bring him back and give him hope through Jesus and through salvation.
[time=2566] Jesus Christ wants to minister to those who are helpless and hopeless and he gives us a wonderful illustration through the life of this man.
[time=2577] Now, thirdly, notice the principles of power that transform the life of this paralytic.
[time=2588] I have been overwhelmed at the questions of Jesus. I've never really seen them like I have since I've been studying John this time through.
[time=2598] Someone ought to write a book on the questions of Jesus. And here's one of the best, the one that just startles you when you read it in its context.
[time=2608] Here's a man laying helpless upon a pallet at the place where, according to his understanding, he had the best chance for any healing.
[time=2617] He had worked in order to get there. Someone had to have brought him and he's laying there with all of the sick.
[time=2623] And Jesus focuses his attention on him and he comes up to him and he says, "Do you want to get better?"
[time=2630] "Will thou be whole?" What a strange question. I'd like to answer for the man if I could.
[time=2639] I think what I would have said had he said that to me, "Well, what do you think I'm here for? Why do you think I lay here every day, hoping against hope that I might get into the pool? Sure I want to be whole."
[time=2652] But Jesus had focused in upon a need in this man's life. We don't really see that need until we hear his answer.
[time=2660] For when Jesus asked him, "Will thou be whole?" He didn't answer. He did what so many people do today.
[time=2666] He said, "Lord, it's not me. That's the problem. It's those other guys." My problem isn't that I don't want to be whole. My problem is that nobody will help me.
[time=2676] There's no man who will put me in the pool. Nobody cares about me. "Lord, don't talk to me about my problem. It's their problem out there."
[time=2685] And Jesus was trying to help this man focus in upon his own life and see that it was his problem.
[time=2693] How do we know that? Why when Jesus met him after the miracle in the temple, in the 14th verse, Jesus said, "The problem you have is a problem related to sin."
[time=2702] Let me be very careful to say that disease and sickness does not necessarily have to do with sin, but sometimes it does.
[time=2712] And Jesus said in the 14th chapter, "Behold thou art made well, sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."
[time=2720] When Jesus asked this man, "Do you want to be well?" What he was saying to him is, "Are you willing to deal with your own situation?
[time=2728] Do you have the desire for your situation to change? Are you willing for me to do something in your life that will change you to make you different?"
[time=2738] Dr. Barkley, who I admire greatly and has written on the Gospel of John, has this pertinent statement about this situation.
[time=2745] He said, "The first essential towards receiving the power of Jesus is the intense desire for it." Jesus Christ wants us to say that we want to be changed.
[time=2758] If in our inward hearts we are well content to stay as we are, there can be no change for us.
[time=2766] The desire for better things must be surging within us.
[time=2770] I've talked to countless hundreds of people about Jesus Christ. Many of them have rejected him.
[time=2776] And I would dare say that 90 to 80 percent of them who reject him have rejected him simply because they don't want change in their life.
[time=2787] Jesus was saying to that man, "Do you want to be changed?" Wilk thou, he was focusing his attention on the will of this man.
[time=2799] And the will is a key thing in the way God works in your life. Do you remember the prodigal son?
[time=2808] Down there in the hog pin, wallowing around in the mud and eating the husks at the pig's aid.
[time=2816] And finally one day in the midst of that degradation he had a picture come to his mind of what it was like back home.
[time=2823] You know what he said? He said, "I will arise and go to my father."
[time=2833] In the last invitation recorded in the Bible, in the 22nd chapter of the book of Revelation,
[time=2839] the Lord Jesus says, "And the Spirit and the bride say come,
[time=2845] and let him that hearth say come, and let him that is a first come, and whosoever will let him come."
[time=2857] I want to ask you today, will thou be made whole?
[time=2862] I'm not asking about all the intellectual problems you have with the gospel.
[time=2865] I'm not asking if you know all that's going to happen to you in the future.
[time=2868] I'm asking you one question, are you willing?
[time=2871] Are you willing for Jesus Christ to change your life and to make you anew?
[time=2877] I don't know about you, but I run into folks a lot of times physically who enjoy their bad health.
[time=2884] You know why they don't get better? They don't want to get better.
[time=2888] The advantages of being ill are too great.
[time=2891] Jesus says to us in our sinful condition, will you be made whole?
[time=2897] The first principle then is the principle of desire.
[time=2901] The second principle that he deals with is the principle of faith.
[time=2906] He says to this man, who never really answered his question, will you be made whole,
[time=2912] but talked about the fact that nobody would take him to the pool, he says to this man, arise, take up your bed and walk.
[time=2921] And this man had been laying on this bed for 38 years.
[time=2925] The word bed is the word pallet. It's sort of like a stretcher that you see folks carrying.
[time=2931] It's just a flimsy old thing, a little legs on it that held him up off the ground a little bit.
[time=2936] And the Lord said to this man, just get up and pick up your bed and walk.
[time=2940] And I want to answer for that man again.
[time=2943] What do you mean get up? If I could get up, I would have gotten up a long time ago.
[time=2948] But there was something in the word that came from the Savior that not only conveyed instruction,
[time=2954] but conveyed faith and caused this man in faith to obey.
[time=2960] When did he get the strength to rise? I don't know.
[time=2964] But I do know that there is a consistent record in the word of God that in the act of obedience,
[time=2970] faith is conveyed. Do you remember the lepers, the Lord healed?
[time=2975] He healed them and he pronounced them well, but it was on their way away from him that they began to examine themselves and discovered that in walking away from Jesus on their way,
[time=2985] they had been made whole.
[time=2987] And when the governor of the feast received the wine that Jesus had miraculously transformed out of the water,
[time=2993] it was someplace between the water pot and the governor of the feast as the servants were obedient.
[time=2999] That the faith transformed into the miracle of the change.
[time=3006] I don't understand the relationship between obedience and faith, but I see obedience in faith in context together every place in the word of God.
[time=3017] Jesus said, "Get up and walk." And the bed on which he had lain for 38 years, he now tucked under his arm and out through that colonnade and out past those pools of water he walked.
[time=3031] And I can tell you he didn't walk with his head down.
[time=3034] He walked triumphantly. He was made whole.
[time=3039] What happened as the result of the miracle?
[time=3051] Could I say just a word about the perfection of the cure?
[time=3055] You remember I told you a few weeks ago that when Jesus does it, he does it right.
[time=3059] What kind of wine did he make when he created wine out of water?
[time=3063] What does the scripture say? It was the best wine.
[time=3068] When he brings healing and wholeness to the life of a individual, he doesn't do it halfway.
[time=3075] First of all, this miracle was a visible one.
[time=3078] It was obvious to everyone who had gathered around that pool that something had happened dynamically to this man that had totally changed him and before the eyes of all who gathered at the pool, he got up and his whole life was different. There was a complete turnaround.
[time=3093] It wasn't Reformation. Reformation wouldn't have done it.
[time=3096] It was the miracle of new life infused in the body of that man by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3103] But it was not only visible folks, it was immediate.
[time=3107] Jesus didn't say to him, now I'll tell you what, if you just stay here for another three or four years, when the waters are troubled, I will perform a secondary miracle and all of a sudden you'll find you're in the pool.
[time=3120] You won't even know it, you'll just be there.
[time=3122] Why the man didn't eat that, he'd been there 38 years already.
[time=3126] He wanted something now, something immediate, and God's salvation is always a now salvation.
[time=3134] It is immediate.
[time=3139] And then it was real. You say, "Pastor Jeremiah, how do you know it was real?" Well, first of all, the evidence of it and his walking and carrying his bed.
[time=3148] But you know, there's something in this text that in my estimation is even more evidence of the reality of the change in this man's life.
[time=3154] For when Jesus met him the next time, you know where he was in the temple.
[time=3159] And what was he doing? He was telling everybody about what had happened to him.
[time=3165] He worshiped and he witnessed. I'll tell you what, those are two pretty good evidences that God has done something in your life.
[time=3172] When you get saved, the first thing you do is you worship, and the second thing you do is you witness.
[time=3177] And when you see somebody worshiping and witnessing, you know they've had the real cure.
[time=3182] Jesus has done something for them as he did for this man.
[time=3188] Now what conclusions should we draw from this story?
[time=3192] First of all, I want you to know that this is an evidence of God's grace.
[time=3200] Someone will say to me after this sermon is over, "Pastor, can you explain to me why Jesus Christ healed that one man and he left all those other sick people there?"
[time=3210] I don't know if I can explain that, but I know it tells me one thing, that it is not always the will of God for everybody to be healed.
[time=3219] Listen carefully. Some people are going to tell you that it's God's will for everyone to be healed.
[time=3227] But can you imagine that if it were the will of God for everyone to be healed, that Jesus Christ would have walked away from all of those sick people and left them there?
[time=3237] No. He chose one from among the many to work his miracle of grace, and he has been doing that from time immemorial.
[time=3250] Ephesians tells me that because I am now saved, and I understand that, that I was chosen in him before the foundation of the world, you say to me, "Pastor, what right do you have to be chosen?"
[time=3262] I don't know. And when that man walked away from that pool, you know what was going on in his heart? The very same thing.
[time=3269] I wonder why he chose me. I wonder why he chose me. Out of the many, he chose one.
[time=3276] And you see, the only way you can deal with that in your own mind is to recognize that there wasn't anyone at that pool who deserved to be healed.
[time=3285] And there isn't anyone who walks on the face of God's green earth who deserves salvation. But in God's grace and in his mercy, he reaches down his hand of salvation and he chooses some from among the many.
[time=3297] And he says, "Be thou whole." When I think of that, and I know I'm one of his children, I know it's not of myself.
[time=3307] I just want to pour out my heart thanksgiving to God that he allowed me to be one whom he's chosen. Do you know what that is? That's God's grace. That's what it is.
[time=3318] God's grace, unmerited favor. I was sick and doomed and damned to hell, and God saved me.
[time=3328] And if you're hearing this message today, you're a candidate for God's grace. You say, "How do I know if I'm one of the chosen?" You won't know until you're saved.
[time=3337] But if you're hearing the message, "Whosoever will," God wants to save you. And he will. He will.
[time=3346] Will you be made whole? Do you want the healing power of God's grace in your life? Shall we pray together?
[time=3362] Do not know Jesus Christ as your savior. There is a desire in your heart right now to know him. I simply ask that you bow your head and say, "Lord, I will be whole."
[time=3372] I do want your saving power in my life. Come into my heart and forgive my sin and be my savior. I accept your plan for my life and your grace.
[time=3383] And I thank you for coming in. And if you make that decision, you are watching at home. Let us know, will you, so that we can convey some information to you that will help you in your growth, in your worship and in your witness. And Father in Heaven.
