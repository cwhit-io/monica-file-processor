[time=16] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=22] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=27] [ Singing ]
[time=58] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=62] We're glad to welcome you to our services today.
[time=68] All of you who are here in the auditorium for the second hour service, and then all of our friends who have joined us by way of television.
[time=75] We're glad to have you with us, and we thank you for the privilege of coming into your home with the message of God's word, the music that glorifies our Savior, and with the fellowship of God's people, which we extend to each and every one of you as you join us during this hour.
[time=91] The choir is going to sing for us now.
[time=93] What is my favorite hymn?
[time=96] And those of you here from the church know that every time I get a chance, we sing this hymn.
[time=100] I just love it.
[time=102] And I hope it's true of your heart and your soul.
[time=105] It is well with my soul.
[time=110] [MUSIC]
[time=140] [ Singing ]
[time=355] >> I've sung it before, but never like that.
[time=358] It was a tremendous thank you choir, Pastor Krueger, what a thrill.
[time=363] All of the instruments here in the auditorium and a few we imported.
[time=367] That was great.
[time=369] Well, let's see.
[time=371] I almost forgot what's next.
[time=372] I was so blessed.
[time=373] We have a young man who sings for us whenever we can get him home from school.
[time=379] He's a student at Indiana University in Bloomington and comes home some on the weekends.
[time=384] And he is always a blessing to us when he sings.
[time=389] We had a wedding here yesterday that I performed and Keith sang at the wedding.
[time=393] So I had a little double blessing this week.
[time=395] I got to hear him yesterday, and now he's going to sing for us today.
[time=398] Keith brought again, and he's singing "My Walk with God."
[time=401] [MUSIC]
[time=414] >> I'll walk with God from this day on.
[time=424] His helping hand, I lean upon.
[time=434] This is my prayer, my humble King.
[time=445] May the Lord be ever with me.
[time=457] There is no death, though I is groaning.
[time=467] There is no fear, but I'm here to live.
[time=479] I lean on him forever, and he'll forsake me.
[time=496] He will not fail me as long as my faith is strong.
[time=522] I may walk alone.
[time=531] I'll walk with God.
[time=537] I'll take his hand.
[time=542] I'll talk with God, he'll understand.
[time=553] I'll pray to him, each day to him.
[time=563] And he'll hear the words that I say.
[time=573] His hand will guide my throne and rod.
[time=584] And I'll never walk alone while I walk with God.
[time=608] [ Applause ]
[time=617] >> We're happy that you've joined us today on the Bible Hour, and we really counted a privilege to take a few moments at the beginning of the offering break and just talk with you at home.
[time=627] My partner in this time together is my wife Donna, who has been out a few weeks because of sickness at home, and at least temporarily we've had a reprieve on that, and we're back together again for this time.
[time=637] To share with our friends at home.
[time=639] Donna has something she wants to talk to you about in just a moment, but before she does, let me talk with you just a moment about our daily Bible study program.
[time=648] I'm so excited to find people all over this whole area who are involved in reading the Bible through in a year's time in the program we call the daily walk.
[time=657] That's exactly what it is.
[time=659] It's an opportunity for you each day to take a few moments and study God's Word.
[time=664] For instance, during the month of February, if you are following the regular daily walk program, you'd be studying along with us the books of Leviticus through Deuteronomy.
[time=673] And in this study, you will find that there are helpful charts to put all of the information together.
[time=678] There's information to apply this information to your own life.
[time=682] There's a memory verse for you to memorize every week and commit to your own heart so that you can grow and understanding what the word means and have the word of God available to you at any time when you need to call it.
[time=693] And when you need to call upon its help, the daily walk is just an excellent way for you to get involved in making the Word of God meaningful in your own life.
[time=702] I'd like to encourage you to take this opportunity to enroll in the daily walk program by simply calling this toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=712] When you call that number, tell the Bible our operator that you would like to be involved in the daily walk.
[time=717] And she will send you the information immediately so that you can join with us in reading through the Scriptures in 1981.
[time=723] Of course, there's an address you can use if you'd like to write to us and we'll give you that address in just a few moments.
[time=729] But before we do, there's something else you might like to request when you write or call, and Donna wants to tell you all about that.
[time=736] We have a handy little booklet entitled Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions for the Lonely, and it's a collection of Scripture verses which deal with that subject.
[time=747] And many people have shared with us how they have used this booklet as a counseling tool, and many people keep it by their telephone.
[time=755] So if someone calls and is really down and discouraged, they can just pick up this little book and share some thoughts directly from God's Word that can be an encouragement to them.
[time=765] If you would like to have a free copy of this little booklet, all you need to do is call us at our toll-free number.
[time=771] That number is 1-800-4539000.
[time=776] We'd be more than happy to send you a free copy, and if you'd like to have one for a friend, just ask for two copies.
[time=783] Or if you prefer, you may write to us and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=794] And we always love to receive your letters, so do write to us this week.
[time=798] Donna, we want to encourage all of our friends who are writing to think about the possibility of enclosing a gift to help with the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=806] As God lays that upon your heart, your help during these days is very much appreciated.
[time=811] We counted a real privilege to do our part in sharing the gospel, and we thank God for the many of you, some of you Founders Club members and others who just give as God enables you to when He lays it upon your heart to do it.
[time=822] You support the ministry from that end of the cycle, and we're so very grateful.
[time=826] Whatever you can do for the Lord's work through the Bible Hour ministry, I know we'll be a blessing to many hearts as the Bible Hour touches many, many homes during these days.
[time=835] Thank you for what you're doing and what you're going to do.
[time=838] God bless you as you share with us the remaining portions of our service today.
[time=852] Jesus is the sweetest man.
[time=858] And He's just the same as His lovely name.
[time=878] And that's the reason why I love Him so.
[time=890] For Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
[time=911] Jesus, Jesus, He means all the world to me.
[time=932] Jesus, Jesus without Him where will I be.
[time=952] He's like a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day, a light in the darkness that drives fear away.
[time=972] He's a pillow for a weary breath, a shelter from the cold.
[time=982] Jesus is all of these and more to my soul.
[time=996] Jesus, Jesus, oh Jesus, there's just something above that name.
[time=1018] Master, save your oh Jesus like the fragrance after the rain.
[time=1038] Jesus, Jesus, oh Jesus.
[time=1047] Let all heaven and earth proclaim.
[time=1058] Kings and kingdoms will all pass away.
[time=1072] But there's something above that name.
[time=1086] Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1101] We lift up the name of Jesus in song or in word, put ourselves in a special place in the mind and heart of God.
[time=1110] And the songs that lift up His name really are a blessing to my own heart.
[time=1114] Thank you so much.
[time=1116] Now in just a few days we're going to be starting a new quarter of outreach evangelism here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1124] Many of you who are part of our congregation this morning have already been asked to participate.
[time=1130] All of you have already signed up to be with us.
[time=1133] And even though I'm making this announcement on television, I just want to encourage all of our friends who are part of the congregation today.
[time=1140] If you haven't ever had the opportunity to be trained for evangelism and to be involved in sharing the story, if you want to sing, that's alright too.
[time=1150] But in sharing the story of Jesus Christ, we have a program to train you to do that.
[time=1155] And we want to have the opportunity to train you to do that this quarter.
[time=1159] Some of you are going to say, "Pastor, I don't have the gift." Well, I'm not sure if any of us are really gifted specifically for the outreach ministry of our church.
[time=1169] But if you are a Christian, you've been called, and that's the important thing.
[time=1173] And it's exciting to know, as Marilyn Wong is going to share with us in a few moments, that God can use ordinary people.
[time=1180] He doesn't use just special people, not the noble, not the mighty, not the strong.
[time=1186] God uses all of us, and all of us are ordinary. None of us are extraordinary.
[time=1191] And it's a thrilling thing to know that if we're in God's family, He can use us, and He will use us, and He wants to use you.
[time=1197] And I hope you'll get involved in sharing with us in the outreach of this church, Marilyn Wong.
[time=1212] [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=1434] Thank you, Marilyn, for providing a very wonderful musical introduction to our scripture lesson today.
[time=1444] And we're reading in the New Testament from the Gospel of John in this series of messages on the miracles of John's Gospel.
[time=1452] We come today to the sixth chapter, verses 1 through 14 as we discuss together the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=1462] John chapter 6 verses 1 through 14 and it is a good thing for us to read the scripture together.
[time=1468] It's a blessing to hear you read it aloud and it has all kinds of meaning to you as you have opportunity to read it aloud.
[time=1476] So let me ask all of us to stand here in the auditorium with our Bibles open and we shall read together in unison the first 14 verses of John's Gospel chapter 6.
[time=1488] After these things, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tiberius and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on those who were diseased.
[time=1504] And Jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover, a beast of the Jews, was near.
[time=1514] When Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, where shall we buy bread that these may eat?
[time=1526] And this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
[time=1532] Philip answered him, "Two hundred of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
[time=1542] One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, there is a lad here who had five barley loaves and two small fishes, but what are they among so many?"
[time=1556] And Jesus said, "Make the men sit down, now there was much grass in the place, so the men sat down in number about five thousand."
[time=1568] And Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were sitting down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
[time=1582] When they were filled he set up to his disciples, gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
[time=1590] Therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above that which they had eaten.
[time=1600] Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, "This is of a truth, that profit, that should come into the world."
[time=1612] Now as we're standing, let us pray.
[time=1616] Father, again we come into thy presence with grateful hearts for the provision of the incarnate word Jesus Christ and for the blessing of the written word which is the Scripture.
[time=1630] Today the written word concerns the incarnate word.
[time=1634] It points us to the Savior who is the resource for each and every one of us in the difficulties we face.
[time=1640] And so Lord I pray that You will open our hearts to the truth about the Savior.
[time=1646] And the message that is in this gospel which we have read this morning, "Oh God make it real to us."
[time=1654] We have come with hungry hearts anticipating that God would speak through His word to each of us to touch us at the point of our great need.
[time=1662] And we pray that that shall be true today in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1668] A Sunday school teacher in a very modernistic Sunday school once had to teach the story which we have read this morning,
[time=1682] the story of the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=1686] And of course since she was very liberal in her understanding of the word of God and did not believe it was the inspired record from the Holy Spirit to us,
[time=1696] she had to explain the supernatural element in the story.
[time=1700] And so she said to her children as she was teaching the story.
[time=1704] And of course children you must understand that it does not mean here that Jesus actually fed all of these people actual food from a few loaves and fishes.
[time=1718] That would have been impossible, she taught them.
[time=1722] It just means that He so fed the people with His teachings that they lost all sense of bodily hunger and went home satisfied that day spiritually.
[time=1738] A children listened to their teacher and finally a little boy in the back of the room raised his hand. He said, "Teacher could I ask a question?"
[time=1744] She said, "Yes." She said, "You know what the miracle you've told us about?" He said, "Yes." And when it was all over, she said, "Yes."
[time=1750] He said, "What did they put in those 12 baskets?"
[time=1756] I couldn't help but think that if we just take the word of God at face value, we don't have to explain it.
[time=1762] We don't have to make it stand on the fours that aren't there for it stands on all fours and when you accept the supernatural element in the word of God, it makes sense.
[time=1772] Now there is an apocryphal story about another young man who went to Sunday school and when he got home his mother said to him, "What did you study today?"
[time=1780] He said, "We studied about the feeding of the 5,000." She says, "What did you learn?"
[time=1786] He said, "Well, it must have been great back in those days when Jesus was alive. All they ever did was fish and loaf."
[time=1798] But the record is clear that this is not about fishing and loafing.
[time=1804] This is a record about God meeting the needs of his people at the very point when the need was the greatest.
[time=1814] Now this record that we are studying today is unique in the sense that it is the only miracle that we will study and it is the only miracle in the gospels apart from the resurrection, which is found in all four of the gospels.
[time=1828] You will find this in the 14th chapter of Matthew.
[time=1830] You will find it in the 6th chapter of Mark and in the 9th chapter of Luke as well as in the 6th chapter of John.
[time=1836] The miracle apparently from the viewpoint of God was so very significantly important that he included a record of it in each of the four gospels.
[time=1844] None of the other miracles fit that category.
[time=1848] John's view of it is rather unique in this sense.
[time=1852] It is not told in John's gospel for the sense of the miracle itself, but the miracle is accounted for as an introduction to John's long discourse on Jesus Christ who is the bread of life.
[time=1866] Now the Bible tells us that this miracle took place at the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1870] And in the text we are told that the Sea of Galilee is also called the Sea of Tiberius in keeping with a custom in the east to oftentimes refer to a body of water after the name of its largest city or the city around its perimeter, which is the largest.
[time=1888] When I was in Israel a few years ago I stayed overnight in the city of Tiberius in a very beautiful hotel that looked out over the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1898] If you were to travel to Israel today you would not see signs of the Sea of Galilee or even the Sea of Tiberius, but you would see signs pointing to the Kenerith, which is the name the Jews have given to that lake today.
[time=1910] The Bible says that after Jesus had finished performing some of his miracles he moved from a place called Capernaum across the Sea of Galilee a space of approximately four miles to the other side of the Sea of Galilee and there he and his disciples were gathered on a hillside.
[time=1928] The story that we are about to study involves people in the plot as follows. First of all there is the hungry crowd.
[time=1938] Secondly there are the confused disciples who don't seem to know what to do.
[time=1942] Then there is the calculating Philip to whom the Lord addresses a question and the accommodating Andrew who brings the resources to the Savior.
[time=1952] There is the little lad who became a hero even though he did not know it and finally there is the Lord Jesus Christ himself who is the source and about whom this miracle pertains.
[time=1966] Now as we open up our Bibles to discuss this miracle we began in the first four verses of the sixth chapter with a definition of the problem.
[time=1976] I have said over and over again in these messages on the miracles that there is never a miracle without a problem.
[time=1982] A problem always precipitates a miracle. Every miracle is built upon the platform of a problem.
[time=1990] Someone has written that problems are situations engineered by God to bring us face to face with our deficiencies
[time=2002] so that we might view his sufficiency as the only alternative.
[time=2006] Problems are situations engineered by God to bring us face to face with our deficiencies so that we may view his sufficiency as the only alternative.
[time=2022] And here in this record, which we are studying today, we have a great problem that is met with the deficiency of the disciples and points them to the sufficiency of the Lord.
[time=2034] The problem is built around some various circumstances of the day.
[time=2042] Since this record is found in all four of the Gospels we have to put all of the accounts together to get all of the information to clearly understand the story.
[time=2050] If we could put all of those Gospel records together we would discover that the problem pertained first of all to the period of time in the day.
[time=2060] The day was far spent. They had been with Jesus now this multitude for a long period of time and it was a long toward evening and they still hadn't eaten.
[time=2070] The Bible tells us that the place where they were, a place that we know geographically to be, Bethsaida, was a desert place.
[time=2076] There were no resources around. They were several miles from the nearest village and there was nothing available to them from the human perspective.
[time=2086] But the greatest problem was not the period of time or the place where they were.
[time=2090] The greatest problem was the amount or the number of people who were there gathered.
[time=2094] Now whenever we read this record and in our Bibles we see the captions which the editors have put over the paragraph.
[time=2102] We always call this the record of the feeding of the five thousand but in essence it is even more drastic and dynamic than that.
[time=2110] For the Jews only counted the men when they counted numbers and the Scripture always tells us the number of men who were present.
[time=2116] And if we are to know the total number who are present, we have to assume the presence of women and children which means that this miracle may have involved upwards of fifteen to twenty thousand individuals.
[time=2128] The Bible tells us that this multitude had gathered because of the miracles which Jesus had done.
[time=2136] Notice that it says in verse two that a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on those who were diseased.
[time=2144] Actually the text reads this way.
[time=2146] They were following because they were viewing as he was performing.
[time=2150] In other words they had been captured by the sensational nature of the miracles that Jesus was working in his time.
[time=2158] The disease that he healed, the water that he turned into wine, the paralytic who was restored to health, the nobleman son who was healed miles from the presence of Jesus.
[time=2170] And the multitude heard about these miracles and they were curiosity motivated as they came to follow him.
[time=2176] They were not seeking a Savior from sin but they were following a worker of miracles.
[time=2184] And in their curiosity they followed the Lord.
[time=2186] Now the Lord Jesus got into a boat and he went across to the other side of the lake some four miles and the multitude walked around the edge of the lake.
[time=2194] And after he had been with his disciples for a short time the multitude gathers on a grassy slope by the Sea of Galilee where Jesus is confronted with their presence.
[time=2204] The problem of course was great.
[time=2208] There was no place to go for food.
[time=2210] It was laid in the day and there were untold multiplied numbers of people who needed to be fed.
[time=2218] Now as we open our understanding to what happens in the context of this miracle we notice secondly the determination of all of the possibilities.
[time=2228] Whenever we are confronted with a problem there are always numerous possibilities which we may explore and we will find that true here.
[time=2238] We note first of all as we look at the second section of the sixth chapter beginning at verse five the Savior's Compassion.
[time=2246] Notice in verse five that we read when Jesus then lifted up his eyes he saw a great company come unto him and he was concerned about their need.
[time=2258] It is interesting to me that whenever people talk about large crowds we get some insight into their priorities.
[time=2264] There are some men who look out over crowds and when they see a large crowd gathered together they see heads and they count heads because their success motivated.
[time=2278] There are others who when they look at a great crowd they see hands and they think of all of the potential of the labor that's involved in such a vast gathering together of people.
[time=2288] Oh how much we can do together because there are so many of us but whenever the Lord Jesus looked at a crowd he consistently did not see the head or the hand but he looked at the heart.
[time=2300] And he is always and consistently motivated with compassion for the needs of the men and women that he views.
[time=2308] For instance in Matthew chapter 10 in verse 36 we see the Lord viewing another multitude of people and it is written of him that when he saw the multitude he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.
[time=2326] He instructs us in this very same Gospel of John chapter 4 in verse 35 that we are to look out upon the harvest fields of the world through his eyes and we are to see not just a multiplied number of people not the potential for getting done what we want done but men and women who are a part of God's harvest and the harvest is white to be reaped and to be harvested.
[time=2350] The compassion of the Lord is not something we can easily miss as we read the Gospels when he saw the multitudes that had gathered there on the slope he concerned himself with their needs.
[time=2362] And as he saw the need he turns to Philip and we see secondly in this whole section of the Scripture not only the Savior's compassion but Philip's calculations and notice when he turned to Philip he said unto him Philip where shall we buy bread that these may eat.
[time=2380] Now there are a number of conjectures as to why he turned to Philip as opposed to the others who were gathered there.
[time=2386] But as you study the background of the Gospel you readily understand that one of the real possibilities for his addressing Philip was the fact that Philip was from Bethsaida.
[time=2396] He lived in that whole area and when the Lord knew that the need was come he addressed Philip and he said Philip is there any place around here where we can buy something for these folks to eat.
[time=2408] Now they did not have hamburger stands and hot dog stands and RBS and all the rest of them around there like we have today but he was asking are there any villages around here where there are where we can go and find food.
[time=2422] Now Philip began to calculate Philip the arithmetic man Philip the calculator he began to figure out what it would take to feed all of this crew and he said Lord if we had 200 denarii worth of bread a denarii was a day's labor pay it was what you get for working a whole day and so Philip was saying if we had 200 workdays worth of bread.
[time=2448] Why we wouldn't have enough even to give a little crumb to every person who's gathered around here.
[time=2452] Lord I see what the possibilities are and if you want to know the truth Lord it's just not possible it can't be done we don't have it.
[time=2462] Now there's an interesting statement in the next verse and it's this and this said Jesus to Philip to test him to prove him for he knew already what he would do.
[time=2472] Now the scripture says that Jesus asked this question of Philip for a specific purpose and that purpose becomes obvious as we unfold the story.
[time=2482] He wanted Philip to see that there were two ways involved here there was man's way and there was God's way and if you try to solve this problem man's way it was a dead end street there was no possibility to get it done.
[time=2496] And that opened up Philip's heart in the heart of the other disciples to see that they needed to turn their attention away from man and to God for he was the only resource who could meet the need that they had.
[time=2508] Sometimes when we tell the story and when we study it we single Philip out and we say oh Philip he was as bad as Thomas he didn't have any faith the rest of the disciples were probably believing but but Philip didn't have any faith.
[time=2522] Unless you go away leaving Philip as one of the culprits in the story let me ask you to turn with me to Mark's account of this miracle found in the sixth chapter of his gospel and we will find that Philip is in good is in good company with the rest of the disciples and their assessment of the problem.
[time=2542] For in Mark chapter 6 and verse 35 we read these words and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far past.
[time=2558] Here's their conclusion send these people away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and by themselves bread for they have nothing to eat.
[time=2568] Philip said we don't have enough to feed them and the disciples said who cares it's not our problem let them go and find their own food.
[time=2576] Philip may have been a step ahead of the rest of the disciples at least he sought the resources that were around and evaluated what it would take and the rest of the disciples said just let them go and get their own food.
[time=2590] In the same gospel of Mark we have our Lord's response to the disciples suggestion and I want to underscore that in your own mind in the 37th verse of Mark's gospel Jesus when he heard the disciples response turn to them and I have to believe he said this sternly.
[time=2610] He said give ye them to eat. No it's not good enough to send them to find their own food you feed them.
[time=2622] As I travel around the country and speak and other churches and talk to conferences where pastors are I discover that there is a division right down the middle between churches.
[time=2630] There are those who take the Lord's command give ye them to eat and take the bread of life and disseminate it as best they know how wherever their church is located and there are others who adopt the philosophy of the disciples which is we're just here if they want to come they can come.
[time=2646] We preach the gospel and they know where we are if they want to come and sit in our church that's great but it isn't our job to feed them it's not our problem to take the bread of life to them we're here and if they want to come where we are that's fine.
[time=2660] But Jesus said and I believe the story is a parable of the dissemination of the bread of life who is Jesus Christ himself Jesus said you do it you take the bread and you give it to them.
[time=2674] A few weeks before I became pastor of this church back in 1969 my father took me down to Cincinnati.
[time=2680] To a large and evangelistic church called the landmark Baptist temple where old Dr. John Rawlings has been holding forth the word for many many years.
[time=2692] We walked into the lobby that day and I didn't know for sure what to expect and I don't remember a great deal about the service but I will never forget the impact that the lobby had on my mind and I'm certain on my ministry.
[time=2704] For there and blazing across the top of the wall of the lobby where no one could miss it were slogans that had been put up over the years.
[time=2712] I did not have the presence of mind to write them all down but some of them just stuck in my mind and I could not forget them.
[time=2720] They said this they will not seek they must be sought.
[time=2726] They will not come they must be brought.
[time=2730] They will not learn they must be taught.
[time=2736] Who has the option in the great commission the lost?
[time=2740] The disciples said let them figure it out themselves.
[time=2744] Jesus said you do it go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature you take the bread of life and you disseminate it.
[time=2752] It was the command of the Lord that set the stage for what happened that day.
[time=2758] And all that goes on in the sixth chapter of Mark that we have just read fits between verses eight and nine of John chapter six.
[time=2768] And we come down now to John's gospel or between verses seven and eight we have all of Mark's account now in the eighth verse of John chapter six.
[time=2776] After the Lord has said to the disciples you give them to eat Andrew steps forward and he says Lord and I can imagine it.
[time=2784] I'm really not sure if this means anything and I feel a little foolish even saying it.
[time=2790] But Lord there's a little boy here and he brought his lunch and that's all I know that we have.
[time=2796] I mean if I'm supposed to feed these people this is all I can find.
[time=2802] I'm sure that Andrew was a little mystified by this whole thing but I can promise you the little boy was petrified.
[time=2810] And here comes the disciple bringing him by the hand up to Jesus who's obviously the most important person there because he's at the top of the hill
[time=2816] and all the rest of them are sitting down there where he's teaching them.
[time=2820] And he's probably having thoughts like I was the only one who had enough sense to bring a lunch now they're going to take mine.
[time=2828] And finally he comes and he and the Lord have a little interchange and isn't it interesting that one few moments worth of time between the Lord and this lad
[time=2838] enshrined that little boy in the hall of fame wherever the gospel is preached wherever Christians teach the word of God that little boy is famous.
[time=2848] Why is he famous? Because he didn't have much but he brought what he had and he gave it to the Lord.
[time=2854] Well just a small exchange but the beginning of a miracle.
[time=2862] In Mark's gospel Jesus asked a question of the disciples which I would ask of you. He said, "Alright we don't have enough to feed the whole bunch
[time=2870] but let me ask you this question. What do you have?" Some of you here today are saying, "Well I can't do this or I can't do that or don't ask me to do this but the question is what is it that God has given you?"
[time=2882] It may not be much in your eyes but whatever it is if you bring it to the Lord and let him bless it it can be multiplied in the ministry of the kingdom of God.
[time=2890] We come now to the third section of this record and here we have the description of the proposition.
[time=2896] We have the description of all the events that took place and let me just point out some of the salient features of this record
[time=2902] but we could spend hours just studying this great miracle. Notice first of all the consciousness of the Savior in verse 6.
[time=2910] I never cease to be amazed at the Lord's method of teaching his disciples.
[time=2914] Verse 6 tells us that when all of this thing transpired in front of the disciples that the Lord Jesus Christ also at that moment in time already had determined what he was going to do.
[time=2928] When he saw the need and the confused disciples and Philip's questions and Andrew's perplexity and the little boy who didn't know for sure what was going on
[time=2938] the Bible says that through all of these circumstances Jesus already knew what he would do.
[time=2942] It is a reminder to me that when I face the problems that come into my life and we face the problems that come into our lives we need to have this perspective that though we don't know what's going on
[time=2954] and we can't figure it out the God in heaven who is in charge of the universe he already knows what he's going to do.
[time=2960] He's got it in perspective.
[time=2966] He's conscious of where we are. Then I notice secondly about our Lord that he's also calm.
[time=2974] Can you imagine today a similar problem with a human leader?
[time=2980] Lord we don't have any food and there are 15,000 people here. What are we going to do?
[time=2986] Panic.
[time=2988] I suppose what would happen if it happened in our culture today is that we had appointed committee.
[time=2994] All right we're going to have a food committee.
[time=2998] I read this week a good definition of a committee if you'll just let me share this with you.
[time=3006] Thus it was that in the beginning was a committee and the committee was good.
[time=3012] The committee was fruitful and multiplied into many committees.
[time=3016] Subcommittees were formed.
[time=3018] They met and then met again with the committee to tell them what they met about, why they did meet and what they're doing now and what they're going to do.
[time=3026] The next meeting will be to decide on when to meet.
[time=3030] Then we'll decide to do what we decided on and if we decide not to do what we decided to do we'll meet again to decide on what not to do.
[time=3038] If we do what we decided on we will then meet again to decide on whether it was meet and write so to do.
[time=3044] Committees. I thank God he was not committed to committees.
[time=3050] If the world had been brought into being by a committee of the Godhead we'd still be in the second day.
[time=3056] Jesus said, I understand a problem, I've got perspective on it, here's what we're going to do.
[time=3066] He was calm just like he was in the boat when the disciples were all wrought up because of the waves. Jesus was asleep.
[time=3076] If he catches our mood in the midst of the problem, how can he be of help to us?
[time=3082] He's calm, he's conscious, he knows what's going on and he's got it all in perspective.
[time=3088] When I want you to notice that he took what was brought to him and he blessed it, verse 11 says, he consecrated this which was brought to him and he gave it to the Lord.
[time=3098] He taught his disciples a lesson that day that loaves unblest our loaves un-multiplyed.
[time=3104] It is possible that what we have is not enough because it has not been consecrated by the Lord for the purpose for which it was intended.
[time=3114] What was the result of all of this? Well, we see this sign miracle which God did and it teaches us some lessons.
[time=3120] First of all, we notice the completeness of God's plan for the working out of the need.
[time=3126] Do you know that God's plan for that particular problem included the lad and the lunch and the disciples and the crowd and even the surplus?
[time=3136] Jesus never misses a detail that is needed when we have a need.
[time=3144] There are times when we are prepared for anything but overwhelming success but this miracle indicates the fact that Jesus even prepared for what was going to be left over.
[time=3156] There were twelve baskets full that remained and some have mentioned that it is quite possible that the twelve disciples who were God's servants that day were rewarded with their own basket because God never forgets his servant.
[time=3168] He always supplies enough so that the servant can be cared for.
[time=3172] But I rather like to think that those twelve baskets may have been given back to the lad because he had already demonstrated.
[time=3178] He knew what to do with that which was his and he had enough now to give again.
[time=3186] Throughout this whole miracle, we are confronted men and women with the divine cooperative between God and his servants.
[time=3198] The Lord could have blessed the food.
[time=3200] Shall we all bow our heads, please? He could have said.
[time=3202] And when I'm finished praying, if you will open your eyes, there will be a fish dinner in front of each one of you.
[time=3208] Didn't do that. He could have done it.
[time=3214] St. Augustine has said that if we believe that God is the governor of the universe, should we have any problem understanding how he could multiply loaves and fishes to supply just a small portion of his creation?
[time=3226] He did not do it because he wanted his disciples to be involved in the ministry which was theirs and so he took the bread and the loaves and he multiplied them and he delegated the responsibility for dissemination to his disciples.
[time=3244] Jesus Christ today could put the stamp of the gospel into every human heart that's ever been born. He could do that.
[time=3252] He could send an angel to be the gospel messenger to every creature in this world. He could do that.
[time=3258] But he has chosen rather to ordain us that we should go into every part of the world carrying the gospel message and he has let us be a part of his plan for the dissemination of the bread of life to lost in hungry men and women.
[time=3272] We do well to remember men and women today that because God has committed himself to the divine cooperative that it is true that he has no hands but our hands to do his work today.
[time=3284] He has no feet but our feet to lead men in his way. He has no voice but our voice to tell men why he died. He has no help but our help to lead men to his side.
[time=3300] And when we say to the Lord, I don't want to be involved. Lord, get somebody else.
[time=3308] We not only draw the boundaries of what God can do in our area in closer but we rob ourselves of the privilege of being a part of the miracle of spreading the word of God, the bread of life.
[time=3324] Do you suppose the disciples ever forgot that day when they kept coming back and back and back and there was always enough?
[time=3332] Do you suppose they ever forgot the look of satisfaction and joy on the faces of the men and women who were gathered there in the hillside as miraculously Jesus fed them and they were a part of it?
[time=3348] I doubt if they ever did. And I promise you something folks, when you get involved in serving God with your life as a part of God's divine cooperative program, you will see things you'll never forget either.
[time=3360] God has called us each and every one to be His disciples to take Jesus Christ to a hungry world and He has called upon the hungry to receive it.
[time=3372] Shall we pray?
[time=3376] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior and you have a hungry heart, as you listen at home right now, you may come to know Him personally.
[time=3388] As He offers Himself to you by way of invitation, it is yours to simply reach out the hand of faith and take the gift of eternal life and say, "I will receive Jesus Christ.
[time=3400] For my own spiritual hunger, I will accept Him into my life." And if you'll do that...
