[time=602] We really are happy that you've joined us today
[time=609] and it really is a privilege for Donna and for me to share these moments with you at home as we talk with you during this brief interlude in the Bible Hour television program.
[time=619] I want to take just a minute before Donna shares with you to encourage all of you who are part of our Founders Club to continue to be faithful and to thank you for your faithfulness.
[time=630] Many of you do not know that the Bible Hour television ministry and soon its radio ministry is dependent totally on men and women who are part of a support group called the Founders Club.
[time=641] I wish it were possible for us to contact you personally and say to each and every one of you thank you so very much.
[time=648] I was speaking in Portage, Michigan on Friday night and a young lady came up to me and said that that week before she had just joined the Founders Club and she was so happy to be a part of the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=659] We thank you for your part.
[time=660] We have written to all of our friends of the Bible Hour ministry to share with them that we are now in the sponsor and associate sponsor period of the Bible Hour year.
[time=670] Many of you remember last year we had such a tremendous time sharing the Bible Hour ministry with men and women all over this area who wanted to have a part in sponsoring a special edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=680] If you received that letter I hope you'll read it carefully and get back to us just as soon as possible so that we can include you in this year's sponsor's program.
[time=689] One of the things we try to do through the Bible Hour is to share materials that are helpful to our friends at home.
[time=695] Donna you've talked a lot about this little booklet that I put together but the more we talk about it the more people write and call for it and we just need to keep making it available to our many friends as long as there's an interest in it.
[time=707] Right and the name of that book is Psalms promises and prescriptions and it's a collection of scripture verses that are helpful to people who are lonely.
[time=717] For instance under promises it contains actual promises from God's Word to help you when you're lonely.
[time=724] For instance it gives Deuteronomy 31-6 be strong and of good courage.
[time=730] Fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and that's a tremendous promise to be able to carry with you when you're going through some dark times to know that God has promised that he is with you and he will take care of you and we would like to send you a free copy of this booklet so you will have these actual scriptures right with you all the time so that if you are feeling down and lonely and need an encouragement from God's Word you can just turn to it in this little booklet and you will have it. If you would like to have a free copy just call our toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=772] Tell the Bible our operator that you would like to have your free copy of Psalms promises and prescriptions for the lonely.
[time=779] Donna next time I write a book I'm going to try to do it and give it a title that's not so hard to pronounce all of those promises prescriptions and Psalms but be that as it may it's got some good material in it not because I wrote it but because it is the scripture pure and simple just the word of God organized to help you we'd like to put that in your hands and we hope you'll get in touch with us this week.
[time=801] When you write for the little booklet I hope that you will also consider the possibility of enrolling in our Bible study program.
[time=809] The Bible study program is called The Daily Walk.
[time=813] It's a little booklet that I hold in my hand right here that comes into your home every single month organizing your Bible study program so that you can read through the Bible in a year.
[time=823] You know much about it already we've talked about it in the past and many of you are already enrolled in reading the Bible and I hope that if you haven't begun your Bible reading program you will do so this week. We'd be happy to get you started. We hope you'll give us that opportunity.
[time=838] Once again if you'd like to be a part of the Bible study program simply call us at 1-800-45-39000 or write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=864] King of my life, I crown thee now.
[time=877] Thine shall the glory be.
[time=884] Lest I forget thine thorn, crown, crown.
[time=890] We greet you, Calvary.
[time=897] Lest I forget, get set anew.
[time=903] Lest I forget thine agony.
[time=910] Lest I forget the love for me.
[time=918] Lead me, O Lord, to Calvary.
[time=925] May I be willing, Lord, to bear daily my cross for you.
[time=938] Lest I forget, get set anew.
[time=958] Lest I forget thine agony.
[time=965] Lest I forget thine love for me.
[time=972] Lead me, O Calvary.
[time=981] Don't let me forget, get set anew.
[time=987] I can't forget your agony.
[time=993] Lest I forget your love for me.
[time=1006] Lead me, O Calvary.
[time=1019] Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1022] If you stay up late on Sunday nights here in Fort Wayne and if you listen to our Christian
[time=1029] radio station, WBCL, at 1130 on Sunday night, you hear a program called Songs in the Night.
[time=1037] If you come to Black Hawk Baptist Church and you're involved in the ministry here on Sunday by 1130 on Sunday night, you are tireder than you've ever been in your life.
[time=1046] So you may already be asleep, but many of us don't run down quite that easily and quite
[time=1052] often I'm able to hear Songs in the Night and the speaker on that program is a fellow that I went to school with who's now pastor of the Moody Church, Mr. Erwin Lutzer, and the new soloist on Songs in the Night is our guest today, Suzanne Johnson.
[time=1067] We're so glad she could be with us and just before we open the Word of God together, she's going to sing for us again.
[time=1089] Is there a heart more bound by sorrow, is there a life weighed down with care?
[time=1104] Come to the cross, by bird and fairy, Lord your anxiety, leave it there.
[time=1122] All your anxiety, all your care, bring to the mercy seat, leave it there, never a bird
[time=1142] and he cannot bear, never a friend, like Jesus, no other friend so keen to help you, no other
[time=1169] friend so keen to hear, no other place to leave your burden, no other one to hear your pray.
[time=1196] Let once delay no longer, heed and treat it, kind and sweet, you need not fear or dis-appoint
[time=1217] you, you shall find rest at the mercy seat, oh your anxiety, all your care, bring to the
[time=1242] mercy seat, leave it there, never a bird, he cannot bear, never a friend, like Jesus.
[time=1268] Thank you, Suzanne, for your ministry to us, we appreciate it very much.
[time=1290] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I want you to open to the sixth chapter of John's Gospel, John chapter 6, and we are going to read together verses 15 through 21,
[time=1306] John's Gospel, chapter 6 verses 15 through 21.
[time=1312] Now we have been reading aloud together and I want us to do that again today, so if you have your Bibles, will you stand with me now as we read the Scriptures aloud?
[time=1323] John chapter 6 beginning at verse 15, let us read together out loud, "When Jesus therefore
[time=1331] perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a King, he departed again
[time=1338] into a mountain himself alone, and when evening was now come, his disciples went down unto
[time=1346] the sea, and entered into a boat and went over the sea toward Capernaum, and it was now dark
[time=1354] and Jesus was not come to them, and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,
[time=1362] so when they had rode about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking
[time=1369] on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship, and they were afraid, but he saith unto them
[time=1377] it is I, be not afraid, then they willingly received him into the ship, and immediately
[time=1384] the ship was at the land to which they went, shall we pray together."
[time=1392] Our God in Heaven, we are so grateful for this truth, as we have studied it and meditated
[time=1400] upon it, it has so gripped our own soul and heart, to understand in a new and different
[time=1408] way the love of an Almighty God for those whom he has created, and specifically for those
[time=1416] whom he has redeemed through the blood of his own Son.
[time=1419] We are thankful for the life and ministry of Jesus Christ for it reveals to us our God.
[time=1428] When we see him, we see the Father.
[time=1432] When we understand him, we understand God.
[time=1437] We come today to this most meaningful portion of thy word with a deep desire to understand
[time=1445] in a new and different way our Savior and our Lord, quiet our hearts, give us attentive
[time=1455] minds, willing spirits, that we may know your truth and apply it to our own lives in
[time=1463] Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1472] John's Gospel is wrapped around seven miracles.
[time=1477] John calls them signs.
[time=1480] Samea is the word in the language of the New Testament.
[time=1484] It is a word which means a miracle that has a deep underlying message, a miracle that
[time=1491] has a truth, a deep truth associated with it.
[time=1495] The seven miracles of John's Gospel, the subject for our studies during these morning hours,
[time=1503] we have talked about the marriage miracle in John chapter 2, the Savior and the Senator's Son in John chapter 4, the paralytic at the pool in John chapter 5, and the feeding of
[time=1516] the 5,000 in the first part of John chapter 6.
[time=1520] We come today to one of the most exciting portions of God's Word, the story of the walking
[time=1526] on the water.
[time=1528] It is a message for us in our generation, and certainly even in recent days its appropriateness
[time=1535] has been made known to my own heart.
[time=1539] Perhaps it is because I am more sensitive to the needs of people, or perhaps they are
[time=1545] more expressive of their needs, but it seems to me that recently we have had an outpouring
[time=1553] even in our own fellowship of the evidence of deep needs in the lives of people.
[time=1559] I have become aware as a pastor that we are bound together in our fellowship not only
[time=1566] by the blood of Christ, not only by our common humanity, but we are bound together by the
[time=1572] problems which we all experience.
[time=1575] There is no one that I know of who escapes the difficulties of life.
[time=1581] Sometimes those problems come to us in such a way as to almost isolate us from the sensitivity
[time=1589] in our own lives to the presence of God.
[time=1593] We seem to be experiencing them in our own little world apart from any knowledge that God is involved.
[time=1600] Some of you have said to me, "Pastor, do you really believe God cares?
[time=1605] Does he know what I am going through?
[time=1606] Does it make any difference to him?" I really wonder if he knows what is going on in my life.
[time=1613] The record that we have in the book today teaches us many things, but it reminds us most
[time=1619] of all of the relationship of the Lord Jesus Christ to his own during times of great difficulty.
[time=1628] Now the story which is recorded verses 15 through 21 is found in two of the other gospels.
[time=1635] You will find it in the 14th chapter of the book of Matthew.
[time=1641] We shall look at a couple of references in those other accounts to supplement what we are going to study today, but here in the 6th chapter in these few verses we have this most interesting story of Jesus walking on the water.
[time=1656] Now the story as we understand it in our preaching today divides itself into three sections.
[time=1663] First of all, in the first few verses of our text we will talk about Jesus apart from
[time=1669] the disciples.
[time=1672] Then secondly we will see Jesus appearing to the disciples, and finally we will explore Jesus aware of the disciples.
[time=1682] First of all, Jesus apart from the disciples.
[time=1686] And will you explore with me this most interesting truth as we look first of all at the reason
[time=1692] behind this whole incident that we are going to study.
[time=1696] You will notice that the miracle of Jesus walking on the water follows immediately the
[time=1702] miracle of the feeding of the 5,000.
[time=1705] The scripture tells us in verse 14 of John chapter 6 that when Jesus finished revealing
[time=1711] Himself through the multiplication of the loaves and the fishes, that those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said, "This is of a truth, that prophet that
[time=1722] should come into the world." And immediately verse 15 says, "Jesus knew that they were going to come and take Him
[time=1729] by force to make Him a king." Jesus, who is the Son of God and sees into the heart of man, understood that the reason
[time=1738] for the great excitement and the acclaim of those who had watched His miracle of the loaves and fishes was nothing to do with His sonship or His Saviorhood.
[time=1748] It had everything to do with the fact that they desired to bring to themselves a dynamic leader who could free them from their Roman dominion, who could lead them in a great insurrection against the Roman government, and at last they could be free from the domination
[time=1764] of the Roman leaders.
[time=1765] Jesus looked into their hearts and He saw that they were following Him not because they believed on Him as the Savior.
[time=1772] They followed Him because they saw His great works and His great miracles and they perceived that those miracles could be useful to them in carrying out their own ambitions and their own desires.
[time=1785] In the second chapter of the book of John, we have a similar incident in the life of our Lord.
[time=1790] Right after the purification in the temple, something that we're going to study in a few days.
[time=1797] When He was all finished with the miracles that surrounded that particular time, we're told in John chapter 2 verse 23, "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the
[time=1807] feast day, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did." Now notice, "But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them because He knew all men.
[time=1820] And He needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.
[time=1825] And when these who had watched His miracle of the loaves and fishes started to flock after Him and tried to force Him into being their king, Jesus looked right into their heart and He said, "I'll have none of it.
[time=1835] I will not be thrust into a role by humanity that is mined by reason of my deity.
[time=1841] I will not be acclaimed to King out of the selfish desires of individuals when God in
[time=1847] heaven has already declared that I am King and one day I will rule." And so He did a most uncommon thing, a thing so uncommon that I doubt if it's ever happened in the history of human leadership.
[time=1859] When the crowd began to grow in response to His popularity, He decided He didn't want any part of it.
[time=1866] And the Scripture says that what He did was this.
[time=1870] He decided to separate Himself from the growing popularity of His new ministry and miracles.
[time=1878] We see first of all then that the reason for this whole incident that's going to take place out in the Sea of Galilee is related to the first miracle.
[time=1885] It came about first of all because of the Lord's desire to get away from the acclaim that was coming to Him by His outward ministry.
[time=1894] Now I want you to notice, secondly, the responsibility for this incident.
[time=1898] And in order to see that clearly, I want you to turn with me to Matthew's Gospel, chapter 14.
[time=1905] In Matthew, chapter 14, in Matthew's account of this very same miracle, He gives us a new
[time=1911] and different insight into the responsibility of what is about to befall the disciples.
[time=1917] In John 14, verse 22, we read these words, "And straightway Jesus constrained His disciples
[time=1926] to get into a boat and to go before Him unto the other side," and He sent the multitudes
[time=1932] away.
[time=1933] And when we get into the midst of this story, we will ask ourselves the question, how did
[time=1939] this all happen?
[time=1941] And the answer is given to us right at the outset.
[time=1944] It happened by the design of the Son of God.
[time=1947] He set it up.
[time=1948] He orchestrated it.
[time=1950] He made it happen.
[time=1951] He told the disciples, "You get in the boat and you go to the other side and He knew full well ahead of time, everything that was going to happen." Do you remember as we have studied the miracles, I have given you the definition of a problem - do you remember what a problem is?
[time=1966] A problem for a Christian is a situation engineered by God to demonstrate to the Christian his
[time=1973] own inadequacy and to force him to depend upon the sufficiency of Jesus Christ as His
[time=1980] only alternative.
[time=1982] This miracle came about men and women because Jesus determined to make it so.
[time=1990] He was responsible for everything that was about to happen.
[time=1993] Now notice thirdly, not only the reason for the incident and the responsibility for it,
[time=1999] but the retelling of the incident.
[time=2001] Now John's gospel is written with the understanding and the knowledge that Matthew and Mark had
[time=2007] already been circulated and written.
[time=2011] John tells this story fully aware of the fact that the story was well known to his readers.
[time=2016] And so he tells it in a most interesting way.
[time=2019] He writes about this incident as one who had been present and now many years later he is reviewing it.
[time=2026] He knows in his own heart that the boat eventually reaches the shore.
[time=2030] He knows in his own heart that Jesus comes to the disciples in the midst of the storm.
[time=2034] He also knows that his readers are aware of this and so he tells the story in this way.
[time=2040] He uses two different tenses in his writing.
[time=2043] He uses the imperfect tense in verses 16 and 17, he says in John chapter 6 verse 16 that
[time=2050] the disciples are going down into the boat and that they are entering into the boat and
[time=2056] they are going over the sea toward Capernaum.
[time=2059] Those are the tenses he is describing the story now.
[time=2062] He goes back behind the history that he is telling and he gives them two facts to pinpoint where the whole thing is going to happen.
[time=2069] And he says as he tells the story they are entering into the boat, they are going across the sea and two things.
[time=2075] It is now dark and Jesus has not yet come to them.
[time=2079] He just gives that information to them so that they will understand where he is as he tells this record.
[time=2085] He is giving this story from the viewpoint of the writer and also from the viewpoint of one who was in the boat and happened to watch everything that happened.
[time=2094] Now as he goes on to convey this record to his readers he comes thirdly or fourthly to
[time=2101] the realities of the incident.
[time=2104] He has given to us the reason for it.
[time=2107] He has told us who is responsible for it.
[time=2110] He has retold the story so we understand how it is going to fit into his pattern of writing.
[time=2114] Now he gives us the details of the record, all of which are recorded in Matthew and Mark but here are retold by John for our help as we understand this story.
[time=2125] First of all he tells us in verse 18 that as they start across the Sea of Galilee a storm
[time=2131] begins to come up.
[time=2133] He tells us that the sea rose because the wind blew.
[time=2137] If you have ever been to Israel you can understand exactly what he is talking about.
[time=2142] For the Sea of Galilee is some 682 feet below the Mediterranean.
[time=2146] It is down in a little basin it is surrounded by mountains and the mountains are separated by great huge cuts into the mountain and in times of great ferocity of wind the wind
[time=2157] blows through those little tunnels and it is just like a chimney in reverse.
[time=2162] It forces the wind down through those tunnels into that Sea of Galilee which is down here in this basin and immediately the waves are churned up and the storm comes up almost in a minute.
[time=2174] Apart from that the Sea of Galilee is a very shallow lake and there is not a lot of body to absorb this blow and so when the wind comes down on the sea the waves come up quickly.
[time=2185] I had an experience like that.
[time=2188] When I was going to camp as a young boy we used to attend camp at Kelly's Island out in Lake Erie when I was growing up as a young lad and one of the fun things about going to camp there was there were no bridges there you had to get on a boat and 12 miles over to the camp and I have to confess that one of the goals of all the boys was to try to find a girl before you hit the shore so you'd get on the boat and by the time the boat got to camp you already had picked out the ones you were going to go after for the week.
[time=2219] As we travel that was an exciting time but there was a very interesting time in my long journey to camp that I shall never forget.
[time=2227] It was certainly very much like what we are reading about here today.
[time=2230] Our lake area you see is a very shallow lake and we were in this big lake cruiser going
[time=2236] across there were cars down on the lower level and the young people all up on top and all of a sudden the storm came up and that boat began to go like this so much so that the
[time=2245] side of the boat seemed to almost be in the water over here and then it would go over here and water was coming up over the top and girls were crying and everybody was heading
[time=2255] for the lower deck and it was frightening and I was afraid.
[time=2260] I estimate more prayer was done in the trip over then through the whole camp experience for the whole week but it was a very frightening thing.
[time=2268] It came up so very quickly.
[time=2271] The scripture says not only had a storm come up but it had become dark.
[time=2275] Verse 17 says this, it was now dark.
[time=2279] The darkness came about because it was evening time and it was time for it to be dark but the darkness also came about because when a storm comes up in Israel or any other place
[time=2289] for that matter immediately darkness penetrates the light and pretty soon it starts to get dark.
[time=2296] A few days ago I was in California and one of the joys of going to California in the winter time if you're a runner is to be able to run outdoors without putting on so many clothes you can't move and it was a nice day.
[time=2308] It wasn't real warm about 55 or 60 and I took my jogging clothes along and I was running in California and I picked out my little course I was going up to this college that I saw and run back it was about two or three miles one way and I got out to the college and it was such a nice day all of a sudden when I almost reached the halfway point where I was going to turn around it seemed like almost in an instant the sky got black and
[time=2332] thunder started and lightning and all of a sudden the storm hit just like that.
[time=2338] I promise you my journey home was a lot faster than my journey out.
[time=2343] I understand what it's like when all of a sudden the darkness and here it was three o'clock but it looked like it was about seven thirty or eight o'clock at night.
[time=2351] And so the disciples are in the boat now and it's getting dark and the storm has come
[time=2358] up.
[time=2358] Now notice verse 19 tells us not only of the stillness of the night and also of the storm that comes up but of the struggle that's involved on their behalf.
[time=2367] Verse 19 gives us this information when they had rode about five and twenty about twenty five or thirty furlongs.
[time=2375] Now here's some more of that New Testament measurements that we have to understand.
[time=2379] The word in the language of the New Testament for furlong is the word stadia and a stadia
[time=2385] is equal to one eighth of an English or Roman mile.
[time=2389] So twenty five or thirty stadia means that they had to rode somewhere between three and one eighth and three and three quarters miles.
[time=2397] That's how much they had accomplished in their journey.
[time=2400] The distance from where they left the shore to where they were headed was approximately five miles.
[time=2405] So they had negotiated part of the journey and when the writer tells us they were in the midst of the sea he gives an accurate account for they were somewhere out in the middle.
[time=2414] We do not know whether they made a straight course from their departure to their destination.
[time=2420] Our minds tell us that probably they did not for the storm would knock them off course.
[time=2425] But they had gone three or four miles and that's an interesting bit of information and made
[time=2431] more interesting when we understand how long it took them to get that far.
[time=2437] Now let's put this together.
[time=2439] The Bible says that they left right after the evening started it was getting dark.
[time=2445] And if you will turn back in your Bibles to Matthew again and the 14th chapter you will find a very interesting piece of information.
[time=2452] Matthew chapter 14 and verse 25.
[time=2456] And here in Matthew's account of this miracle he tells us this, that in the fourth watch
[time=2462] of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea.
[time=2467] So from the time they started right at the beginning of the evening until Jesus came to them in the fourth watch of the night how long is that?
[time=2476] Well the fourth watch of the night in the calendar of the Jewish people began at three o'clock in the morning and it lasted until six o'clock in the morning.
[time=2485] That was the fourth quadrant of the fourth watch of the night.
[time=2489] So now notice they started on their journey around seven or eight o'clock at night and
[time=2495] they had been rowing from that period of time until three, four, five or six o'clock in the morning and in all of that struggle in all of that time they had negotiated three or four miles.
[time=2507] That gives us a little insight into what kind of an agony they were in in the midst of this storm and how long it had taken them to labor thus far.
[time=2516] And so this is what's going on with the disciples as they're apart from the Lord Jesus.
[time=2523] The disciples in their situation, in their circumstances, may I stop for just a moment and tell you that there's not a Christian listening to my voice who hasn't been in the
[time=2534] stillness, in the storm, and in the struggle and wondered where in the world the Lord was.
[time=2544] Have you ever been there, Lord, do you know what's going on with me?
[time=2549] Here I am out in the middle of this mess and I'm giving it everything I've got and I don't know if you know I'm here.
[time=2557] And immediately we are thrust into the second part of this record which gives us Jesus appearing to the disciples.
[time=2563] Now notice the revelation of the Savior.
[time=2568] After nine hours or eight hours or seven hours or however long they had been working at this they look up all of a sudden and they see the most amazing sight they had ever seen
[time=2578] in their lives.
[time=2581] They see a form walking on top of the water.
[time=2586] He does not seem to be bothered by the wind or the gale.
[time=2590] He is not bobbing up and down in the water like a bobber from all of the turmoil of the sea.
[time=2595] He is not tossed around.
[time=2597] He doesn't seem to be wet with a sprayer soaked with the water.
[time=2600] He just seems to be walking on a smooth and solid path right across the water itself.
[time=2605] Did you know the Bible tells us that God has the ability to do that?
[time=2611] Way back as far as the book of Job, Job chapter 9 verse 8 says, "He alone spreadeth the heavens
[time=2618] and treadeth upon the waves of the sea," Job 9, 8.
[time=2623] And Isaiah 43, 16 says, "Thus saith the Lord who makeeth away in the sea and a path
[time=2630] in the mighty waters." The disciples look up and they see this most amazing sight.
[time=2638] Now let me try to help you understand how it was for them.
[time=2642] They are in this huge row boat and they have their back to the front of the boat and they're
[time=2648] all 12 of them in there and they're pulling on the oars.
[time=2651] Each of them has a hold of one or and they're just pulling for all their worth.
[time=2655] Their back is toward their destination and they are facing the place from which they have departed.
[time=2662] They have been rowing for seven or eight hours as hard as they can all of a sudden as they
[time=2668] look out from their viewpoint looking out over the back part of the boat, they see Jesus
[time=2675] walking toward them.
[time=2678] Now I want you to notice something in the text.
[time=2682] The scripture says, "He is walking on the sea and he is drawing near."
[time=2690] What that means is that they as 12 strong men had been working all night to try to make their way from here to there and they weren't making much time and all of a sudden they look out, here comes one solitary individual and he's negotiating the water and he's catching
[time=2705] up with them.
[time=2707] In fact one gospel gives you the impression that he almost walks past them and the disciples
[time=2713] see this and it just overwhelms them.
[time=2718] And Mark tells us in his gospel that they thought they were seeing a ghost.
[time=2730] I don't want to be too uncharitable to the disciples, the darkness of the night, the struggle, the storm, the danger that they felt, all of it certainly had them in a situation where they could believe almost anything.
[time=2742] In fact if they didn't have any of these other circumstances except that they'd been up all night, that would be enough.
[time=2749] Have you ever stayed up all night?
[time=2753] Have you ever driven all night long?
[time=2756] When my wife and I were in seminary in Dallas, we didn't have near as much sense as we have now and that tells you something about us, doesn't it?
[time=2764] When she'd get off work at Blue Cross on Friday afternoon, on at least three or four occasions, she would come home and she'd say, "Honey, let's go home this weekend." We'd get in our car in Dallas and we'd drive straight through to Cedarville, Ohio, one thousand and fifty miles.
[time=2781] We'd only stop to get gas, use the facilities, and get a candy bar and we'd take off again.
[time=2787] And about three o'clock in the morning, when you'd been driving all night, a leaf hit your window and you'd swear it was an elephant.
[time=2795] And you just, what was that?
[time=2800] I can understand where these disciples were coming from, that's situation and now they see Jesus coming to them on the water and they're afraid.
[time=2813] They cried out for fear.
[time=2818] That's Jesus' appearance.
[time=2820] The disciples apart from Jesus, now Jesus appearing to the disciples and here is the whole purpose
[time=2827] of this miracle, Jesus aware of the disciples.
[time=2833] Where was he during all of this?
[time=2836] When all of these things were happening to his beloved ones, that he had just called to serve him, where was he when all of this was going on in their life?
[time=2844] Let me tell you four things about the Savior that you need to know, that apply directly to you.
[time=2849] First of all, notice the Savior's watch.
[time=2852] Back in the 15th verse of this 6th chapter we're told, in the end of the verse, that
[time=2858] when he sent his disciples away, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
[time=2865] Now turn back in your Bibles to Matthew 14 and let me read two verses together that give
[time=2872] you the picture of what's happening in the perspective of our Lord during this terrible time of struggle for his disciples, in Matthew 14 verses 23 and 24 we read these words.
[time=2885] And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain privately, notice
[time=2891] to pray.
[time=2893] And when the evening was come, he was there alone, but the boat was now in the midst of the sea tossed with the waves, for the wind was contrary.
[time=2902] Where was Jesus up here?
[time=2905] In the mountain, praying while his disciples were down here in the storm, struggling.
[time=2912] And Matthew paints that as if it is one great big picture, not two pictures.
[time=2918] As the divine artist, he puts Jesus here in the disciples here and he would have us see that together so that we not lose perspective.
[time=2926] The disciples aren't alone apart from the Savior, Jesus is not alone apart from the disciples.
[time=2931] We do not see them with the eye of the flesh together, but as we see them in the Scripture, we see the picture like this.
[time=2942] And Mark adds this most interesting detail in his writing.
[time=2948] Mark adds in chapter 6 of Mark verse 48, "Listen now, and Jesus saw them toiling and
[time=2955] rowing." He was watching the whole deal.
[time=2961] You say from the mountain, I read this week, someone wrote that it was a full moon, so we could see it all, I don't believe that.
[time=2969] Jesus saw with his eyes through the darkness of that experience, right into the lives of those disciples, the Bible says that darkness and light are both alike to the Lord.
[time=2979] He is not kept back from our problems because what we view as darkness, he saw them and he was watching them and every moment in the midst of that struggle, he was aware of what
[time=2990] was happening.
[time=2992] Notice secondly, he waited.
[time=2994] I wish I had time to develop this.
[time=2996] This is the most difficult thing for me to understand and even more so to experience.
[time=3002] When they went into the boat at 7 o'clock, he went to the mountain and from 7 o'clock until 3 o'clock at least in the morning while they were struggling, he was up there watching.
[time=3013] I have to say, "Lord, why did you wait so long?" As I have asked him that so many times in my own life, he waited.
[time=3024] Someone has said that omnipotence can wait because it already knows how the story ends up.
[time=3032] He waited because he was in control and he waited just long enough to teach his disciples what he wanted them to know and at exactly the right moment when the time was perfect according to his plan, not according to theirs, he moved into that situation and we see thirdly
[time=3050] not only the Savior's watch and his wait but his word.
[time=3054] When he comes to them on the sea, he says, "May fabe esta," which is imperative, "Stop
[time=3062] being afraid.
[time=3064] Be of good cheer.
[time=3066] It is I." As David writes in the shepherd's psalm, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me." As Isaiah writes in the 43rd chapter of his book, "When I walk through the waters," he goes with me, "Jesus' word in the midst of our troubles always comes to us in order to
[time=3090] confirm his presence with us.
[time=3094] Whenever he speaks to us in the midst of difficulty, his word is always to assure us that he is with us," and so in his word he said, "Don't be afraid.
[time=3107] Be of good cheer.
[time=3109] I'm here." Was Jesus just then present with them or was he not also present with them when he was
[time=3119] on the mountain?
[time=3122] He made his presence known to them when he appeared to them on the sea of Galilee but he was with them as he watched them in the mountain.
[time=3133] And then notice the Savior's work.
[time=3137] He did not watch and wait and have a word for them except that he might demonstrate his
[time=3144] power in their behalf.
[time=3146] And there are at least four different miracles that take place in this story.
[time=3151] First of all, Jesus walks on the water.
[time=3154] Secondly, as we are told in Mark's Gospel in a Matthew's Gospel, he makes it possible for Peter to walk on the water.
[time=3162] Thirdly, when he gets into the boat, he calms the sea.
[time=3165] Now, fourthly, and I never really saw this before but it's there and it's easy for us
[time=3171] to see it.
[time=3173] Here in the book of John we're told that when Jesus got into the boat, when he was received
[time=3179] into the boat, verse 21, immediately the boat was at the land.
[time=3185] And I looked up those words because I thought I was misunderstanding it but the word cannot be misunderstood.
[time=3192] The word euthatos for immediately means that just like that, when he stepped into the boat, they were at their destination and that was the fourth miracle.
[time=3205] And I was reminded of how beautifully the psalmist summarizes what happened that night
[time=3213] in Psalm 107, one of the most beautiful and one of my favorite passages of Scripture.
[time=3221] And this is what the psalmist says.
[time=3224] He says, "They that go down," verse 23, "they that go down to the sea in ships, that do
[time=3230] business in great waters.
[time=3233] These see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep." Now listen, for he commanded and raised at the stormy wind which lifted up the waves thereof.
[time=3244] They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths, their soul is melted because of their trouble.
[time=3250] They reel to and fro, they stagger like a drunken man, they're at their wits end.
[time=3256] Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
[time=3267] He makeeth the storm acom so that the waves thereof are still.
[time=3272] Now listen, they are glad because they are quiet, so he bringeth them unto their desired
[time=3281] haven.
[time=3282] Now I want you to notice, every element of this miracle is in this psalm, the trouble,
[time=3288] the storm, the cry, the stilling, and then the last miracle, the arrival at the destination.
[time=3298] What does this mean to you?
[time=3300] What does it mean to me?
[time=3302] Oh, it's such a precious truth.
[time=3305] It says to us that when we are struggling in the midst of our difficulty down here, down below, here in this world, in the midst of the stormy turmoil that is ours by nature
[time=3316] of our affinity with humanity, when all of the difficulties are coming down on us, when
[time=3322] the waves are high and we're so discouraged, he knows, he sees it all, he has it in control,
[time=3329] just at the right moment, he intercedes in the situation for he has as his purpose to
[time=3335] bring us to the end of the way, shall we pray.
[time=3345] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you certainly do not fit into this record.
[time=3352] He came unto his own to deliver them, to help them, and encourage them.
[time=3357] The storm is alike to both the saved and the unsaved, but the Savior is there to deliver
[time=3363] those who have put their trust in him.
[time=3366] I would ask you this morning as we close this hour, those of you who are watching by television,
[time=3372] if you do not know the Savior, if you've never put your trust in him, if you do not know for sure that he is yours and you are his today, right now, this very moment, you can bow your
[time=3385] head before God and say, "Oh God, I know I'm a sinner and I cannot save myself.
[time=3390] I want you to be my Savior, come into my life, and forgive my sin, and give me the gift of
[time=3396] eternal life, and he'll do it today.
[time=3398] He is promised, and he is made good on that promise to many, many folks who have trusted
[time=3404] him." And Father, you've been sharing the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
