[time=11] We present the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah
[time=30] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=44] And we're grateful for your being here today and for sharing with us in this our morning service This is the second worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church And we're coming to you at home by television from the convocation center here in Fort Wayne at the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=59] We're grateful for your presence. We thank God for the opportunity of this ministry And it is our prayer that during this hour you will find your heart encouraged That you will know more about the Lord Jesus Christ when we're finished than you do now And that you will be blessed and encouraged through all that happens in these few moments that we have together
[time=79] Our choir is going to begin our worship this morning as they sing for us about the cross of Christ A theme which will be carried out in much of our music this morning
[time=114] Christ A theme which will be carried out in the world of our life.
[time=1022] You may be seated.
[time=1023] While the Peterson's are coming to sing to us, I want to remind all of you as I'm trying to do consistently throughout this year that there is a way for you to study the Bible on other days besides Sunday.
[time=1036] And that way is through the use of the daily walk.
[time=1039] This Bible study program takes you through the scripture in a year.
[time=1043] That's a wonderful way to become acquainted with all of the truths of the Bible, reading now in the Old Testament and then as we move toward the end of the year on into the new.
[time=1052] Those of you here in the auditorium, if you don't receive the daily walk in your home and are not following it, and you would like to.
[time=1058] If you'll just put your name and address on a card and give it to me at the door or to one of the ushers, we'll see that you get it.
[time=1066] Those of you who are watching by television, if you'd like to receive the daily walk, there is a toll-free number that you can call that will make it possible for you to receive this right in your own home.
[time=1076] It is a way for us to extend the ministry of the Bible hour throughout the week into your lives
[time=1082] and we hope you'll take advantage of it if you don't already have a way to study the scriptures.
[time=1087] Just before the message, we're going to listen to the ministry of our own singers, the Pedersen's, as they share with us in music.
[time=1109] [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=1262] Thank you, Peterson, and I want to ask you to join with me now as we open the Bible, God's Holy Word, to the ninth chapter of the Gospel of John, John chapter 9.
[time=1275] And we have been reading together from the Scriptures, and we've been reading out loud together.
[time=1282] And I know we have a few different translations, but most of us are close together, and so if we read loud enough, it doesn't really matter.
[time=1290] I tried this recently at the Moody Founders Week, and I found out that the divergence of translations there was much greater than it is here.
[time=1299] It sounded like the babbling of Christians, but we don't have much that problem, and I hope you will join with us now.
[time=1306] If you're here without a copy of the Scriptures, somebody next to you will share theirs with you, and you can just hold on to it together and read out loud.
[time=1313] Let's all stand, shall we?
[time=1317] John chapter 9, and we're reading through the first nine verses.
[time=1323] And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth, and his disciples asked him, saying, "Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
[time=1340] Jesus answered, "Neither have this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
[time=1350] I must work the works of him that sent me while in his day, the night cometh when no man can work.
[time=1359] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.
[time=1375] And said unto him, "Go wash in the pool of silo, which is by interpretation sent." He went his way, therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
[time=1388] The neighbors, therefore, and they, who before had seen him, that he was blind, said, "Is not this he that sat and begged. Some said this is he. Others said he is like him, but he said, "I am he."
[time=1407] Let us pray.
[time=1409] God in heaven, we so want to hear what you would have for us from the Word of God today.
[time=1416] We have not come for an intellectual exercise to simply expound some deep exegetical truth.
[time=1426] We have come with hungry and needy hearts, and we would hear what you would say to us.
[time=1431] We pray that as we study the Word of God today, you will help us, that in our explanation we shall be accurate, and in our explanation we shall be clear so that everyone understands.
[time=1445] But Lord, if we simply understand the truth and do not apply it to our own hearts, we will go home, empty-hearted. And so we ask that you will open our hearts to receive what you would say to us, to me, to each and every individual, both here in this auditorium, and those who listen by way of television, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1471] We have been studying from the Gospel of John in these early weeks of 1981, and I have been learning so much, and I'm thanking God for what he has been teaching me about the revelation of his son through the Gospels.
[time=1486] I am learning more and more that when Jesus said, "If you have seen me, you have seen the Father," he was giving us a clue to understanding all that God is about.
[time=1497] He was saying, "If you can come to grips with what Jesus Christ is, as He is pictured in the Gospels, you will come to know what God is all about.
[time=1507] Everywhere and almost every page of the Gospels we see a picture of Jesus, and when we see Jesus we see God.
[time=1514] For Jesus Christ is the definitive explanation and manifestation of God.
[time=1520] He is the one who has come to show us what God is all about, and every story that we have studied, in every discourse that we have opened up.
[time=1529] In every one of the accounts in the Gospel there is a wonderful picture of Jesus Christ, and it is so also in this Gospel that we are studying today.
[time=1539] For here in the 9th chapter there are four things that clearly come out to us from the text that show us who Christ is, and as we see who He is, who God is.
[time=1550] We see the ultimate purpose of Christ, and we see in this text the urgent priority of Christ, and we see the unique plan of Christ.
[time=1564] And finally we see the undeniable proof of Christ.
[time=1569] We begin first of all then as we understand something of the ultimate purpose of Christ.
[time=1577] What a study this is in contrast. At the end of the 8th chapter we see our Lord in the temple, and He is about to be stoned by the Jews.
[time=1588] Verse 59 of chapter 8 says, "Then took they up stones to cast at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them, and He so passed by."
[time=1599] Now notice without a breath chapter 9, "And as Jesus passed by He saw a man who was blind from his birth."
[time=1608] Jesus, having almost been stoned by the Jews in the temple, passes out through the Jews, and as He goes out through the temple courtyard and gets to the gate there He sees a Jew.
[time=1620] And He stops for a moment, noticing that that Jew is blind.
[time=1624] Having almost been killed by the Jews, He stops to minister to a Jew.
[time=1629] What a contrast between Him and the disciples. For we're told that this man who was afflicted with a congenital disease did not provoke within the disciples a desire to help, but rather a desire to question.
[time=1645] The scriptures tell us that this man who according to verse 8 was a beggar had been sitting there and begging as a blind man. He had been blind since his birth.
[time=1655] And when the disciples saw them, saw those beggars there and saw this particular one, all they were interested in was to use Him as a quizzical question.
[time=1666] How can we disseminate what's wrong with this boy born blind? He has been there all of these years without anyone to help him who could help him.
[time=1677] And the disciples are with the master of the universe, and they see this blind man, and unlike the Savior, the blind man is not someone who deserves their pity, but someone who becomes a puzzle to them.
[time=1690] And so they ask a question, and as they see this blind man, they pose one of the age-old questions of the universe which has caused many scholars to dig deeply.
[time=1702] They said, according to verse 2, "Master, who did sin this man or his parents that he should be born blind?
[time=1713] They did not care about his need. They wanted to instead talk about the abstract problem of his blindness."
[time=1723] If I could paraphrase their question, I would say it this way. They were saying, "Master, back of every physical affliction or defect lies a sin."
[time=1734] Now, this man has a defect. He is blind, and so I want to know, where is the sin that's responsible for his blindness?
[time=1745] And they posed two possible areas for the sin, either in him personally or in his parents.
[time=1751] In essence, what they were saying, though, is that there were four possibilities to explain this man's blindness, first of all, perhaps it was due to his personal sin.
[time=1760] When we studied the healing of the paralytic at the pool over in the fifth chapter of John, do you remember when Jesus found that man in the temple?
[time=1769] He said to him, "Go and sin no more, lest a worse thing before thee." And in essence, he was saying that that blind man had been, that paralytic had been afflicted because of some sin in his life, and he said to him, "Don't do that anymore."
[time=1783] So it is possible that you can be sick, you can have problems because of personal sin.
[time=1789] But how could that be true of this man? For the scripture says, he was born blind.
[time=1794] He was not blind after he did some evil. When he came into this world, he was already blind.
[time=1801] So how could he have committed some sin that caused his blindness? Well, the Jews wouldn't be taken back by that at all.
[time=1808] They had all kinds of ways to explain that. For instance, the Jews believed in the day of Jesus in prenatal sin.
[time=1814] They had the crazy idea that it was possible to sin while still in the womb.
[time=1820] And they said when Jacob and Esau were in the womb of Rebekah as recorded in Genesis 26, the scripture says they struggled within the womb, and according to them, that meant that Jacob tried to kill Esau before they were born.
[time=1833] And so when they'd see somebody sick, they'd say, "Well, maybe he's sinned." Before he was born, prenatal sin.
[time=1840] What a crazy idea. Some kids do seem like they get a head start coming into the world.
[time=1848] But I don't believe in prenatal sin. They said, "Well, maybe it's not prenatal sin. Maybe it's pre-existent sin."
[time=1858] The Jews in Jesus' day had the idea that it was possible for a person to sin even before he existed within the womb.
[time=1866] And the way they explained that was by taking a page out of the Greeks book and the book of Plato.
[time=1873] And they said that all of the souls of the universe were stored in some chamber long before the world, long before the Garden of Eden.
[time=1881] And that when a person is born, they get a soul from the storage place. And all of those souls determined what kind of a person.
[time=1888] Now the Jews thought all the souls were good, and when they came into a contaminated fleshly body, they became evil.
[time=1894] Or the Greeks thought that. But the Jews thought that you could have a good soul or a bad soul.
[time=1898] And one of the apocryphal books called the Book of Wisdom. There is a statement by an individual who said,
[time=1907] "Now I was a child, good by nature, and a good soul fell to my lot."
[time=1913] In other words, he was thanking somebody that when he was born, he got a good soul from the holding chamber.
[time=1921] And so the Jews thought that you were predetermined to be good or bad by the kind of soul you've gotten.
[time=1927] And so they reasoned this man must have gotten a bad soul, and so he was born blind.
[time=1933] Well, that was the third possibility, and the fourth possibility was that perhaps he had been born blind because of his parents.
[time=1941] Now you see, in the Old Testament, the Old Testament teaches that sometimes children reap the result of parental sin.
[time=1951] In the Book of Exodus, for instance, we're told that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation.
[time=1959] That is a principle repeated often in the Old Testament.
[time=1963] And it is true even today that sometimes the sins of parents are reaped in the children.
[time=1969] For instance, I am told that sometimes children who are born to parents who have venereal disease can be born blind.
[time=1977] We are hearing today in our world much about drug addiction and how mothers who are drug addicts can give birth to a child.
[time=1985] And when that child is born into the world, it has all of the symptoms of being an addict passed on from the parents.
[time=1994] It is a true statement, men and women, that there is no way to estimate what happens when we sin and we set in motion the chain reaction that keeps going on and on and on out into infinity.
[time=2008] It is true that many times what happens in our homes and what we are as parents, those things are reaped in the lives of our children,
[time=2018] men and women who care nothing about the things of God who are "Christians" pass on to their children that it's all right to be a Christian in name only.
[time=2027] You don't have to be one indeed.
[time=2029] The sins of the fathers reaped upon the children.
[time=2032] What you see in asking this question of the Lord, the disciples made two mistakes.
[time=2038] When they said who did sin this man or his parents, the first mistake they made was that instead of having pity on the man, they made a puzzle out of him.
[time=2048] They looked backward to what had happened in his past.
[time=2052] Jesus had a forward look. He was concerned about his future.
[time=2055] The first mistake was they didn't look at the man in the proper light.
[time=2058] The second mistake is a mistake that has been made by many since their day, and that was this.
[time=2063] They attributed specific suffering to specific sin.
[time=2069] Now it is true that all suffering is the result of sin in the general sense.
[time=2075] We have been born into this world, children of Adam, and we have reaped Adam's nature, and all of the world is sick and suffering because of the principle of sin.
[time=2085] But men and women, it is not true to say that every specific suffering is the result of some specific sin.
[time=2095] Do you know that's the problem Job had?
[time=2098] I feel so sorry for Job when I read about him.
[time=2103] Poor old Job, he'd lost everything in the world.
[time=2106] His family and his fortune and his health, and he's sitting there with nothing left.
[time=2112] He has been stripped down to nothing, and some comforters come to minister to him.
[time=2117] And I pray every time I read this book, "Oh God, if I ever get sick, keep those people away from me."
[time=2123] The first one was a man by the name of Eliphaz, and we read about him in Job in the fourth chapter.
[time=2130] He came to Job, and he said, "Job, I want to remind you of a truth that you ought to know, and that is this, that the innocent and the righteous don't suffer."
[time=2138] Job, chapter 4, and Job said, "Thanks a lot, I needed that." He had hardly gotten out the door, and in came the next guy, Bill Dad, and Bill Dad said to him,
[time=2149] "Job, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help evil doers."
[time=2155] So don't look for any help, Job, you're an evil doer, God, I'm going to help you.
[time=2160] And then as if to top it all off, this is the epitome of all of the kind of comfort that Job got in his day.
[time=2167] A man by the name of Zofar, his third comforter, came to him and said, "Job, no therefore, now get this, no Job, that God exacteth of the less than thy iniquity deserveth."
[time=2181] Job, you think you're sick now, if you were as sick as you ought to be, why you'd have one foot in the grave.
[time=2188] Now isn't that some kind of comfort to get when you're not feeling good?
[time=2192] What was their problem?
[time=2194] Their problem was the problem, the disciples put their finger upon in this passage.
[time=2198] Their problem was that they thought Job's specific suffering was related to some specific sin.
[time=2205] But what does the Scripture say?
[time=2206] Job, chapter 1, verse 1 says, "Job was a righteous man."
[time=2213] And so when these disciples asked Jesus this question, what did he say?
[time=2218] Why he said right here in this text, he said, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents."
[time=2228] That he was born blind.
[time=2231] I get so tired today of hearing people say on television, on the radio.
[time=2238] The reason you're sick is because you don't have enough faith.
[time=2242] The reason you're sick is there's some unconfessed sin in your life.
[time=2247] The reason you're sick is you have a demon.
[time=2252] Do you know that some of the greatest saints in all of the history of the world have been great sufferers?
[time=2261] I want you to turn in your Bibles to the 13th chapter of Luke.
[time=2265] And I think we can settle this issue once and for all, right here, right now.
[time=2270] On an occasion, Jesus was confronted with a problem.
[time=2276] And in Luke, chapter 13, beginning at the first verse, we read, "And there were present at that season,
[time=2283] some that told Jesus of the Galileans whose blood pilot had mingled with their sacrifices."
[time=2289] In other words, they had been killed and their blood had been mingled with the sacrifices.
[time=2294] And Jesus' answering said unto them, "Now I suppose that you think these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans
[time=2302] because they suffered such things.
[time=2304] I tell you, no!" Who said that? Jesus said that.
[time=2312] He said they were not suffering and did not participate in this tragedy because they were great sinners.
[time=2318] He said that had anything to do with it.
[time=2320] All right, well, what about a tragedy? Suppose somebody goes out and he gets hit by a car and he's wiped out just like that.
[time=2325] Must be some sin in his life, right? Notice the next verse.
[time=2329] "Or those 18 upon whom the tower in Silom fell and killed them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem.
[time=2338] I tell you, no!" I want to shout that from the highest housetop because I run into people all the time
[time=2347] who are hurting and suffering, and some person has told them that their suffering is because their sin in their life, that they have not confessed.
[time=2356] It could be. It might be, but there are many, many cases where it is not so.
[time=2363] Jesus said this man is not sick because he is a sinner.
[time=2369] He is sick. In order that, the works of God might be manifested in him.
[time=2375] You say, Pastor, if you think you've solved one problem, you have just created a bigger one.
[time=2383] It sounds as if this man was born blind in order that Jesus Christ might experience some kind of healing with him.
[time=2394] To put it in modern, in modern colloquial language, it sounds like Jesus made him broken so he could fix him.
[time=2401] Isn't that what it sounds like? Sounds like Jesus made this man broken so he could have the joy of fixing him.
[time=2408] I want to ask you a question. We have a number of doctors in our church, and I'm going to ask this question to the doctors.
[time=2414] We don't have any orthopedic men, so I can play with that science just a little bit, not get in trouble.
[time=2420] Let me ask you a question.
[time=2422] Suppose a doctor who had great skill as a bone setter decided that he had the right to break the leg of his son so that he could demonstrate his skill in mending that leg.
[time=2439] Would that be right? Would you think that would be right?
[time=2443] Man, I wouldn't want to be born into a doctor's home like that, would you?
[time=2447] Why that wouldn't be right? That wouldn't be moral.
[time=2452] Now, but wait a minute.
[time=2455] But if the child had a broken leg, would it be right and would it be moral and would that doctor be operating within the sphere of love if he inflicted whatever pain he needed to inflict on that boy in order that he might mend that bone?
[time=2470] Why? Certainly. One of the things they tell me you have to learn in medical school is how to be positive about inflicting pain.
[time=2477] Every doctor I've ever been to has already mastered that art. I am sure.
[time=2484] Now, do you see the lesson? Here's the point.
[time=2487] Whenever we read this story, we always think about the blindness of this man, and we say, "How unfortunate for him to be born blind?"
[time=2496] But the issue is not his physical blindness. The scripture says he was born physically blind, and the result of that was there was a day in his life when his spiritual blindness was cured.
[time=2510] And I promise you that if we could go back and live in those days and could have known that blind man after he was cured, in fact, as we'll learn that later on in the study of John, he went into the temple, he told all the Pharisees, he told his neighbors, he told everybody, I was blind.
[time=2525] Now, I see. Oh, I'm so thankful I was born blind.
[time=2530] Because if it had not been for my blindness, I never would have come to Christ.
[time=2535] And over at the end of John, chapter 9, Jesus says that this man who was born blind was far, far above the Pharisees who had spiritual eyesight but died spiritually blind.
[time=2549] So you see, Jesus is manifesting forth his glory through meeting the need in the blind man, not just physically but spiritually.
[time=2560] Now you say to me, "But pastor, how do you explain the suffering and the sickness and the hurting in this world, and how can God possibly get glory to himself through all of that?"
[time=2574] Well, I've pondered that, and it's a question I am asked often.
[time=2579] I want to suggest to you just briefly three things that I think will be helpful to you, first of all.
[time=2585] The glory of God is always enhanced through the healing of a person who is sick.
[time=2594] The miracles in John's gospel are always signs of God's glory.
[time=2598] The marriage of Cain of Galilee, when he changed the water into wine, the scripture says, he manifested forth his glory.
[time=2605] He showed forth his glory.
[time=2607] John, chapter 1, verse 14 says, "And he became flesh, and he dwelt among us, and we," says John, "beheld his glory."
[time=2615] How?
[time=2616] Through the miracles that he did, through the healings, and all of the things Jesus did, he glorified himself through these marvelous works that he accomplished.
[time=2625] We have a friend here in our city, does not go to this church, he's a fine Christian leader, went into the hospital one day,
[time=2632] and they took a picture of his lungs, and they saw spots on his lungs, just as clear as you can imagine.
[time=2638] And he called us, some of us, and he said, "Would you pray?" and we began to pray, and some folks from his church went to the hospital and prayed over him.
[time=2646] And the next day he went into X-ray, and they took a picture of his lungs, and they couldn't find one single spot.
[time=2652] You say, "How did that happen?" It happened through prayer.
[time=2656] God did that.
[time=2658] And you know what? Everybody in the hospital was buzzing about it.
[time=2661] Why, you know, here's the X-rays the day before, and here's the, "How did that happen?" God did that. Do you believe God can do that? Sure.
[time=2668] I do. I know he can.
[time=2670] And that man has been telling everybody how God healed him, not how some healer healed him, but how God healed him, through prayer.
[time=2678] So whenever a hurting person is healed, God gets the glory.
[time=2683] Now when God heals him, he gets the glory. When a person does it, they take the glory.
[time=2689] The second way that God is glorified through suffering is through the hurting.
[time=2697] The hurting brings glory to God. You say, "Now, how could that be?" Well, it's true. It's true.
[time=2704] Did you know that when affliction and sorrow and pain and disappointment and loss come to a Christian,
[time=2711] they bring to that Christian an opportunity unparalleled in their physical life to glorify God?
[time=2720] Just as in the Old Testament when Gideon went out to do war against the Midianites and he carried in his hand a pitcher with a light in it,
[time=2729] that light could not be seen and could not accomplish its purpose until the pitcher was broken.
[time=2736] And oftentimes in our lives, it is when our lives are broken, and this old clay vessel is cracked open
[time=2743] that the light of the glorious gospel shines through and brings glory to the Savior.
[time=2748] I read the other day about an old saintly man who was dying in agony of pain, and he called his family together and he said, "Come and see how a Christian can die."
[time=2760] I've watched some Christians die and I want to tell you something through the hurting they glorify God.
[time=2766] Well, sometimes we glorify God through our healing and sometimes through our hurting
[time=2772] and sometimes through the helping. Did you know that?
[time=2778] When a person is hurting, when they're sick and someone comes to help and encourage them, it is in the helping that God gets glory. Why is that true? Because when we minister to someone, we show what God is like. We demonstrate the glory of God so that others can see Him through us.
[time=2797] That, my friend, was the purpose of all of this and that's why Jesus said, "This man was born blind, that the works of God might be manifest in Him."
[time=2808] That is the ultimate purpose of Jesus Christ. I must work the works of Him that sent me while there is day.
[time=2815] Jesus' whole purpose was to glorify God, and that ought to be our purpose as well.
[time=2821] Now I want you to notice, secondly, the urgent priority of Christ.
[time=2827] In John chapter 9, we read in the next verse that Jesus Christ, looking to His disciples, having heard that question and answering it, said,
[time=2844] "I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work."
[time=2850] And the word "I" there is really better translated in our text by the word "we." He includes us in that, it is a plural.
[time=2858] He says, "We must work the works of Him while there is time, the urgency, the urgent priority of Jesus Christ."
[time=2868] Over and over again in the gospels, we hear Jesus saying, "I must, I must, I must, the Son of Man must be lifted up."
[time=2875] Over and over again, we sense the urgency of what Jesus is doing as He healed this blind man.
[time=2881] There were others who needed to be healed, and He sensed the urgency of His ministry.
[time=2885] As I travel around the country and meet with other Christians, one of the things that seems to be so lacking in our world of Christendom today is any sense of urgency about the work of God.
[time=2895] If I feel like serving Him today, wonderful. If I don't, that's okay too.
[time=2900] I read the story of Robert Murray McShane, one of the great stalwarts of the faith who lived in a day past.
[time=2908] He died at 29 years of age because he burned himself up for God.
[time=2913] Every day as he got out of bed, he would go until he just about dropped to serve God.
[time=2919] I'm not saying that's the wise way to expend your life.
[time=2923] But you know what, right on the face of Robert Murray McShane's watch were these words, "The Nightcometh."
[time=2931] "The Nightcometh." I know you all know that I turned 40 this week. You know it seems like just yesterday I was 20.
[time=2941] And someone gave me the good news this morning that the days between 40 or 50 are the fastest days of your life.
[time=2948] I don't know if that's true. But Harold just slips away and gets away from us and all of a sudden the things we were going to do for God don't get done.
[time=2957] No urgency about it at all. I read a poem someone wrote to try to describe this.
[time=2965] It goes like this, "Listen to the water mill all the live long day.
[time=2970] Here the squeaking wheels as they wear the hours away, languidly the water glides ever on and still.
[time=2979] But never coming back again to the old water mill.
[time=2984] Take this lesson to yourselves. It is all so true.
[time=2989] Golden years are passing by and youth is passing too. Wealth and power and intellect may not cannot last.
[time=2997] The mill can never grind with the water that has passed.
[time=3002] The urgency, the priority of doing the work of God while there is time.
[time=3007] When was the night about which he spoke? Well he tells us in verse 5, "I must work the works of him that sent me while there is day the night cometh when no man can work
[time=3017] as long as I am in the world." I am the light of the world.
[time=3021] When does our night come? Men and women we don't know. It may be that God will give us 80 years of ministry and service.
[time=3030] It may be that like Murray McShane we will die young but the night is surely coming for every Christian.
[time=3036] And only while we're in this world can we do his work.
[time=3040] And oh that God would give to me an urgency that he would give to you an urgency to get busy for him
[time=3046] and begin to do what he's called us to do with some sense of urgency and some sense of motivation and concern.
[time=3055] I must work the works of him that sent me while there is time, while there is day.
[time=3063] And then you'll notice thirdly the unique plan of Christ. He did a strange thing here.
[time=3071] Scripture says that he took spittle and he made clay and he put it on the blind man's eyes.
[time=3078] And my children would say how gross. Why did he do that? Well I'm not sure I know.
[time=3086] You know it is true that in the olden days when Jesus lived that was considered to be a medicinal thing.
[time=3093] There is a man by the name of Pliny who wrote a scientific book for the Romans and in that book he said that spittle was a curative for epilepsy
[time=3103] for snake bites and fasting spittle could even cure a crick in the neck.
[time=3110] That must have been some sort of special thing.
[time=3114] Every time you burn your finger you go stick it right in your mouth or you pinch your finger.
[time=3124] Spittle. He made clay out of spittle and he put it on the blind man's eyes.
[time=3134] And then he said you go and wash in the pool of salom.
[time=3137] The pool of salom was a basin right inside the city.
[time=3140] It had collected the water that came through a conduit from the springs of Gihan.
[time=3145] The virgin pools outside the city it was a masterful engineering feat that Hezekiah had built.
[time=3150] When Sennacherib was going to come and to siege the city he was afraid of the water supply and so he had his engineers built this long channel 583 feet long.
[time=3160] Through solid rock six feet high two feet wide and the water came down through that into the city so that if an army came and surrounded Jerusalem
[time=3168] they would still have a water supply. Jesus said you go and wash in the pool of Shiloh in the pool of salom.
[time=3175] And you know what happened? He went. Notice the text. He went. He washed and he was healed.
[time=3185] It's so simple. He doesn't try to make something profound out of it.
[time=3189] He did what the Lord told him to do and he received the benefit the Lord promised him he would get.
[time=3195] Now what does that mean? How does that relate to us? How can we understand that?
[time=3202] You know this week as I was studying I became aware of something that to me was a profound discovery.
[time=3210] All through the Old Testament from the beginning to the end there is no record of the healing of a blind man.
[time=3218] Isn't that interesting? By an individual.
[time=3221] Oh we're told that God is the healer of the blind. We have prophecies of the blind being healed all through the Old Testament.
[time=3227] When you get to the New Testament no record of the apostles.
[time=3230] The closest you come to it is when Ananias comes to Paul who had been temporarily made blind and laid his hands on him and he received his sight.
[time=3238] You know that? Nobody else.
[time=3240] And in the miracles of Jesus Christ the one miracle that he performed more than any other miracle was healing of the blind.
[time=3247] Eight times in the Gospels he did that. Why do you suppose that's true?
[time=3253] Listen folks it's to remind us that there is a disease which only Jesus Christ can cure.
[time=3261] And you know what that disease is? That is spiritual blindness.
[time=3266] Every one of us was born blind. Every single one of us we have been born blind spiritually without eyesight to see God.
[time=3274] How do we get cured? Only one place. You've got to come to Jesus. He's the only one who can do it.
[time=3280] There aren't anyone. There's no one else who can do it. Only Jesus can do it.
[time=3285] And how do we get that cure?
[time=3288] You know the scripture says the pool of Salom was called the pool of the scent.
[time=3293] It got its name because it collected the waters that were sent from the spring out here down through that conduit and they called the pool of Shiloh the scent pool.
[time=3302] And I was struck this week as I read John to discover that one of the things that is said about Jesus Christ more than anything else in John's Gospel is he was the one who was sent from the Father.
[time=3314] How do you get healed from your spiritual blindness? Why? Only Jesus can do it.
[time=3320] And how does it happen? You go and wash yourself in the cleansing blood of the one who was sent from the Father and as you're washed you become clean.
[time=3331] That's what it teaches us. It is a picture in the physical realm of Jesus Christ who is the light of the world who wants to heal the spiritual blindness of everyone who will come to him.
[time=3343] I wonder if you wouldn't like to do that. You were born spiritually blind every last one of you, all of us, but you can find in Jesus Christ the cure for your blindness if you put your trust in him.
[time=3357] Let's bow together in prayer, shall we? All our heads are bowed in our eyes are clothed.
[time=3362] As I speak to those of you who are at home, let me ask you to do this.
[time=3367] Will you today confess that you're blind spiritually, that you need God?
[time=3372] And will you come to Jesus Christ and say, "Oh God, I know that I'm a sinner, and that I need Christ as my Savior, and so this moment I come to accept Christ as my only hope of heaven."
[time=3386] Ask for forgiveness of my sins and wash in his precious blood for the healing of my spiritual blindness.
[time=3394] And if you'll do that, right now this very moment it will be said of you as it was of this man.
[time=3400] He did what Jesus said, and he got what Jesus promised.
[time=3404] And when you do that, write us and let us know if you're watching at home and make that decision that we can help you and send you some literature to get you started right.
[time=3413] God bless you as you make your decision for Christ today.
