[time=0] (bell ringing) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=29] Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=36] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=68] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=77] - And we're so very happy to welcome you to the Ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=86] This is the Lord's Day.
[time=87] We have met already once today in the early service, and now we have come together for the last worship service of the morning.
[time=95] And this is special in the sense that it is our open service that we share with all of our friends at home by television.
[time=102] We're glad to have you all with us, and we're praying that this will be a time of rich blessing in your life, and that you will be encouraged and drawn closer to our Lord through the ministry of this hour.
[time=113] We have music that is glorifying to the Lord, and it is very much a part of our worship.
[time=118] We begin our music this morning with the ministry of our choir as they sing.
[time=123] A hymn arrangement of a very famous and favorite hymn about the blood of Christ and its sufficiency for our needs.
[time=131] The choir is under the direction of Mr. Don Krueger.
[time=134] (gentle piano music)
[time=141] (singing in foreign language)
[time=261] - Thank you, Choir, for your ministry to our hearts.
[time=271] In a few moments, we're going to be opening the Word of God to a very famous and exciting chapter in John's Gospel, the 11th chapter, which is the resurrection chapter in the Gospel of John.
[time=283] Several years ago, our friend from close by here in Fort Wayne, Mr. Bill Gaither, and the words of a very beautiful and victorious Gospel song called "Because He Lives." It reminds us of all of the things that we have as Christians because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=303] It is a dynamic and triumphant song of the believer's life in Jesus.
[time=309] And Keith Brodigam and Starr Narwal are going to share that song with us because he lives by Bill Gaither.
[time=316] (gentle piano music)
[time=326] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=512] (audience applauds)
[time=524] - We're so very happy that you've joined us today.
[time=532] Don and I have a wonderful time sharing with you at home what God is doing through the Bible hour ministry, talking to you about the important things that are going on in the life of our church and in the life of the outreach ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=545] One of the things that is going on right now is the sponsors program, which comes in this period of time each year to help in the underwriting of the cost of the Bible hour.
[time=556] Sponsors program is an opportunity for individuals to underwrite entire programs in their areas or to be an associate sponsor by sending $100 for the cost of a program on their station, perhaps even in honor of someone they love.
[time=573] And Donna, this is the very first Sunday for the sponsors program to be inaugurated and you have someone who is the very first sponsor that you want to introduce to us.
[time=582] - That's right, we have our first associate sponsor today and it's Mr. Colin Lister from Fort Wayne who is sponsoring the Bible hour on channel 21 today and we certainly want to thank him for his part in getting the gospel out over the airways today.
[time=596] - Donna, most of you, most of our friends here know that Colin Lister is the general manager of the Fort Wayne Comets hockey team and we're grateful to have him as a friend and as a person who is involved in sharing the Bible hour ministry here in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=613] One of the other things that we have been talking about in recent days is the daily walk ministry.
[time=618] I ran into some folks this week who told me that their family, each one in their family, individuals who don't even live in this area, are involved in reading the daily walk.
[time=631] I visited in a home on Thursday night with a businessman who tells me that he puts the daily walk in his briefcase and takes it with him on his business trips and he finds that those early hours in the motel when he's away from home are really best spent in the Word of God and he has a program and a plan to operate his own devotional life.
[time=649] Now the daily walk is a beautiful monthly publication that comes from the Bible hour office into your home organizing your devotional life.
[time=659] The daily walk is a plan to get you into the Word of God each and every day of your life and if you follow the plan within a year's time you will have read through the entire Bible both old and New Testaments.
[time=671] Now the daily walk at this particular time is in the book of Joshua but it really doesn't make any difference where you start.
[time=678] You can start any month you want to start in the year and just stay in the cycle for a year's period of time and you will have read the entire scripture.
[time=686] We'd like to send the daily walk to you as our opportunity to you to get involved in a daily Bible study program.
[time=693] We'll be happy to send you the first issue absolutely free if you will call us at 1-800-453-9000.
[time=701] When you call simply ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you'd like to have your free copy of the daily walk and get started in your Bible study program.
[time=711] Along with Bible study and on daily basis it's also important to be able to have scriptures at your command that will help you with your problems.
[time=720] Donna has another little publication she wants to tell you about that I think will be helpful to you.
[time=725] - We have offered this booklet for a number of weeks now.
[time=727] It's Psalms, Promises and Prescriptions and we are still getting a lot of requests for it.
[time=732] So we want to give you another opportunity if you have not asked to receive your free copy of this booklet we'd like to send it to you.
[time=740] What it is is a collection of scripture verses that deal with loneliness.
[time=745] And there are different kinds of loneliness that come in all different kinds of situations.
[time=750] And I was just happening to think this morning of the number of people who are hurting because of the economy and there's a loneliness that comes with that when you lose your job.
[time=759] And there was a passage here from Romans 831 which says, what shall we say then to these things?
[time=765] If God be for us, who could be against us?
[time=768] And that he will take care of us even in these times of economic problems and hardships and or whatever kind of loneliness you're experiencing.
[time=777] And we'd like to send you a copy of this booklet and all you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=786] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her you would like to have your free copy of this booklet or also you may have a copy of the daily walk.
[time=795] Donna, we're so grateful for the many friends who have already called and written.
[time=799] Many who just recently have enrolled in the daily walk program and many, many requests that have come to us for this special booklet on loneliness.
[time=807] And we are not going to be offering this again on this television program.
[time=810] And so this is really the last opportunity you have to request this special booklet on loneliness.
[time=816] We'd like to send it to you this week.
[time=818] And we urge you to call us at the toll free number or to write to me Pastor David Jeremiah, a post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=827] Thank you so much for being a part of the Bible our telecast today.
[time=830] And please stay with us as we come in a few moments to the Word of God.
[time=833] And the last in this series of messages on the seven miracles of John's gospel.
[time=839] The most important one that we began today is the resurrection of Lazarus.
[time=843] We hope you'll be with us as we study the Scripture this morning.
[time=847] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=1037] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1045] There is not anything in all of the world that is more glorious than a talented voice dedicated to the Lord.
[time=1052] And we're grateful for Keith and the gift that God has given to him and his tremendous desire to use that gift to glorify our Savior.
[time=1062] Now, I happen to believe that the men's quartet in this church is about the best there is.
[time=1067] I don't tell anybody that because it could be embarrassing to the guys in the group.
[time=1071] But they sing for us as often as I can get it done. That's not often enough.
[time=1078] They're going to share with us a song today that is a very beautiful arrangement of a reminder to all of us as to the point of attention for each of our spiritual lives.
[time=1089] As we turn our eyes and our lives and all of ourselves over to the Lord Jesus, listen to the men's quartet.
[time=1108] If you are aimlessly wandering alone, turn your lives over to Jesus.
[time=1131] If you need someone to call your own, turn your life over to him.
[time=1147] You can depend on the love he will provide, all your confusion in him you can confide.
[time=1164] He gave his own life to save you. Why don't you give yours to him?
[time=1181] If you are good and with heart, they can breathe.
[time=1205] Cast all your care upon Jesus. Only in him can you find relief.
[time=1222] Cast all your care upon him. Of his great love he is wanting you to learn.
[time=1238] Trust him for you are his person of concern. He will not leave or forsake you.
[time=1254] Why not start trusting him? Turn your life over to him.
[time=1278] It is a good song because it is presented in excellence, but it is a good song because it has a tremendous message.
[time=1293] And before the message is given, the invitation is extended to turn your life over to Jesus Christ.
[time=1300] If you have not done that, any time in your life that you can remember, the quartet has invited you to do that and we shall do so again before the service is over.
[time=1310] Open your Bibles with me to the 11th chapter of John's Gospel.
[time=1316] John chapter 11, and I am going to read out loud for our hearing this morning, the first 15 verses. John 11, 1 through 15, and you follow in your Bibles as I read from mine, the first 15 verses of John.
[time=1332] Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
[time=1340] And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick.
[time=1348] Therefore his sister said unto him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick."
[time=1355] When Jesus heard that, he said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified by it."
[time=1364] Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
[time=1374] Then after that, sayeth he to his disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."
[time=1381] Now his disciples say unto him, "Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and go astow there again." Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day?"
[time=1391] If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not because he seeeth the light of this world. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there is no light in him.
[time=1402] These things said he, and after that he sayeth unto them, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep."
[time=1412] Then said his disciples, "Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well." However Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
[time=1423] Then said Jesus unto them plainly, "Lazarus is dead, and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.
[time=1430] To the intent you may believe, nevertheless, let us go unto him."
[time=1437] Then shall we pray.
[time=1440] Father, we are so grateful for the Word of God, which liveth and abiteth forever, for the strength that it supplies for our being,
[time=1450] for the help that it gives to us in our daily walk.
[time=1455] We are grateful that it is the food which we eat. It is the water for our thirsty mouths.
[time=1463] And we confess today, dear God, that we come to the Word as hungry and thirsty children of thine.
[time=1470] We want to hear what thou would say to us. We want to know that which would be useful in our lives as we take these days that are directly before us
[time=1483] to live for the Father.
[time=1486] There are so many things that will impact our thinking and will inundate our minds during these moments
[time=1493] to keep us from total concentration upon the truth of God.
[time=1497] I pray that you will defeat every single effort of our adversary to keep us from full attention to thy word,
[time=1505] for if we do not hear it, we cannot apply it.
[time=1508] And if we do not understand it, it can make no difference in the way we live.
[time=1513] We come, first of all, as hearers of the Word, that in response to hearing, we may be doers.
[time=1520] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1525] Seven weeks ago, I began a series of messages on the gospel of John,
[time=1532] and in the morning services I have been preaching on the miracles of John's gospel.
[time=1537] In the gospel of John there are seven miracles which John takes from the life and teaching of Jesus Christ,
[time=1545] and using those miracles he builds his gospel around them, using the miracle as a beginning, as an introduction, and then following that with a discourse or a teaching on the theme of the miracle.
[time=1558] Today, we began a study of the seventh miracle.
[time=1563] Now, when I months ago laid out the series of messages I intended to take one Sunday on each miracle,
[time=1571] and in the other miracles that we have studied, it has been quite possible for us to take the miracle in its context and deal with it,
[time=1578] and then as we catch up with the miracle in our studies in the evening to build the theme around it,
[time=1584] as I tried to anticipate that for the miracle of the raising of Lazarus from the dead became quite apparent to me that it would be necessary for us to study the whole chapter, and that is not possible in one message, so I have taken the last message and divided it into three sections,
[time=1600] and this morning we will deal with the first.
[time=1604] John records the raising of Lazarus from the dead, and it is quite evident as we study it that it is the climactic miracle of the gospel.
[time=1614] It is the climax, no matter by what measurement you judge it.
[time=1621] First of all, it is certainly climactic because it's the last of the seven miracles that we have studied, and just as Jesus saved the best wine until last, I think he saved the best miracle until last, too.
[time=1633] But it is also the most important and climactic miracle because it comes in the gospel right before the beginning
[time=1641] of the final week in the life of Jesus Christ here on this earth.
[time=1646] In fact, there are many scholars who believe that it was the Lord's miracle in raising Lazarus from the dead
[time=1652] that caused the Jews to finally get angry enough to take him and nail him to the cross.
[time=1660] This is one of the most important miracles in the Bible and certainly the most important one in John's gospel
[time=1667] because here in the gospel of John it is given more space than any other miracle.
[time=1672] Forty-six verses are used to record the events around the miracle and the actual miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus.
[time=1680] The detail in these verses is unbelievable.
[time=1683] Every nuance that you would need to have to understand it completely is given in full detail.
[time=1689] The result of this miracle sent Jesus Christ to the cross.
[time=1694] The understanding of this miracle will bring every individual to the cross.
[time=1699] For lying beneath the surface in the understanding of our Lord's physical resurrection of Lazarus from the grave
[time=1706] is the message of our Lord's desire to bring everyone who is spiritually dead out of the grave of sin
[time=1715] and resurrect them to newness of life in Christ Jesus.
[time=1719] All of the aspects of this miracle that we examine in the physical realm can be transported over into the spiritual realm
[time=1727] and we can see how they illustrate so wonderfully what happened to you and to me the moment we believed
[time=1733] and accepted Christ in a personal way and were brought according to the Scripture out of death into life
[time=1739] passing from condemnation into eternal life.
[time=1743] And so as we study this miracle in these next three weeks and examine it in detail we will take time along the way
[time=1750] to apply it to the spiritual realities of each one of us.
[time=1755] Now the miracles of Jesus in John's gospel illustrate to us much of his nature.
[time=1761] Beginning back in the second chapter as we studied the miracle at Cain of Galilee we learned about our Lord
[time=1767] that he is interested in our happiness and he is interested in our homes.
[time=1771] The miracle was performed in the context of a very humble Jewish dwelling.
[time=1776] When we studied the nobleman's son we learned that the Lord has power over sickness
[time=1782] and that that power is not bounded by geographical location he can heal at a close approximation or he can heal at a distance.
[time=1791] When we studied the miracle of the paralytic at the pool we saw a wonderful picture of the helplessness
[time=1799] of every individual who is outside of Christ who has no ability whatsoever to do anything
[time=1805] to change their spiritual situation.
[time=1808] The feeding of the five thousand illustrates to us that Jesus Christ is the bread of life.
[time=1814] The walking on the water taught us that Christ has power over all of nature in all four of those miracles that are concentrated in that one episode in the life of Christ.
[time=1824] We see the power of Jesus Christ over his creation.
[time=1829] The blind boy whose life we studied last week taught us that it is possible for us to be spiritually blind
[time=1837] as well as physically blind and that we need Jesus Christ as the light of the world if we are to see spiritual truth.
[time=1845] Today as we begin the study of Lazarus and his resurrection we understand how all of these miracles
[time=1853] are found in some measure in what Christ did at that tomb.
[time=1858] Here all of these things that we have talked about come together as if threads from each miracle
[time=1865] are wound back into the central and focal point of the gospel which is here in the 11th chapter.
[time=1872] Now the 11th chapter needs to be divided into three sections for our study.
[time=1878] Though it is not always possible to do this in this study we can do it geographically.
[time=1883] For in the first 15 verses we see the Lord Jesus in Pariah in the region of Pariah.
[time=1889] Here he is away away from the crowd, away resting away from all that's going on in Bethany where Lazarus is and where he dies.
[time=1898] Verses 1 through 15 tell us all that's going on in the mind of Christ when he hears the news that Lazarus the one he loves has died.
[time=1907] In verses 16 through 37 we have Jesus leaving Pariah and coming to Bethany and in verses 16 to 37 he carries on a conversation
[time=1918] with the mourners outside of Bethany.
[time=1921] And then in verses 38 through the end of the chapter we have Jesus at the grave side in Bethany
[time=1927] and there he transacts this wonderful miracle which we have all come to love.
[time=1932] Today in these few moments that we have we will study only the first few verses and what happened to Jesus in Pariah with his disciples.
[time=1942] The first thing we notice in our understanding of these first few verses is this.
[time=1947] We notice the purpose of Jesus in all that's going to happen from this point on.
[time=1952] Notice verse 4.
[time=1954] When Jesus heard that he said concerning Lazarus this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified by it.
[time=1966] Is it not strange that two weeks in a row we are running into this theme just as the boy who was born blind was in that condition in order that the glory of God might be manifested.
[time=1978] Jesus says that this situation that makes it necessary for the resurrection of Lazarus to take place this situation is for the glory of God.
[time=1988] And I cannot help but stop for a few moments and explore that and ask some questions how in the world can God be glorified through someone who dies.
[time=1999] And yet immediately as we read the story we discover that because of the death of Lazarus we learn of the resurrection of Lazarus and without a death there can be no resurrection and certainly the resurrection of Lazarus brought glory to the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2015] Though the record does not record it I am quite certain that there were many occasions when Lazarus glorified Christ because of what had happened to him through the power of Jesus.
[time=2025] But the record is very clear that there were many who saw this miracle who watched what happened who were drawn to the Savior.
[time=2033] In your Bibles notice with me verses 14 and 15.
[time=2037] Here we are told that Jesus was glad for the death of Lazarus because for the sake of his disciples to the intent that they might believe Lazarus had died.
[time=2048] And so God was glorified through the death of Lazarus because through the miracle that followed the disciples were caused to have a new level of belief in their Lord that they had not had there to for.
[time=2062] But if we follow down through the text to the 19th verse of this chapter we discover that there were those who watched this miracle apart from the disciples.
[time=2070] For in verse 19 we are told that many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.
[time=2078] Just as in our day and time when someone dies in our family friends come to be an encouragement to us when the friends of Mary and Martha heard that Lazarus had died they gathered to be a comfort to her.
[time=2090] There were many Jews who came to mourn with these two sisters over the death of their brother.
[time=2096] Now the result of their being present during all of these circumstances is given to us in verse 45 of this very same chapter.
[time=2104] And many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did what does it say.
[time=2111] They believed on him. So again in a secondary circle of influence we see that the death and resurrection of Lazarus has redown to the glory of God through what happened in the lives of the disciples.
[time=2125] Let us look at one other possibility here in this chapter that will help us to understand what God is doing through this miracle.
[time=2132] In verses 41 and 42 we read these words. Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father I thank thee that thou hast heard me."
[time=2145] Now notice these words. And I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
[time=2157] So first of all we have the family of Lazarus believing and then the Jews who came believing and finally at the graveside we have the bystanders believing those who gathered out of curiosity just to see what was going on.
[time=2172] So when Jesus says in verse 4 of chapter 11 that Lazarus was sick in order that the glory of God might be magnified what he is saying is that through this experience Christ Jesus is going to be lifted up and many are going to be drawn to his name.
[time=2190] Now it's interesting to me that in the last miracle we have exactly that which is true in the first miracle. For after the first miracle in Cana of Galilee the scripture says in John 2 11 that this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana and manifested forth his glory.
[time=2209] And in the last miracle which is the climax of all of John's teaching we have exactly the same truth that Lazarus died and Jesus resurrected him and all of it was done in order that the glory of God might be magnified.
[time=2224] I don't understand all of the ramifications of God's glory through difficult situations but it is a consistent theme throughout the scripture that when God finds us in times of difficulty and when he rescues us through his own power that God in heaven is glorified through that process.
[time=2245] Donald Gray Barnhouse who for many years was the pastor of the 10th Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia and who had the first coast to coast radio program of a Christian nature called the Bible study hour which was on a network across this nation for many years has written about this passage a very interesting statement.
[time=2265] Listen to his words. He said I quite believe that God does this. That he does it with every one of us and he does it all the time.
[time=2275] That it is the Lord's way if God wants you to trust in him he puts you in a place of difficulty. If he wants you to really trust in him he puts you in a place of impossibility.
[time=2285] For when a thing is impossible then we who are so prone to move things through the force of our own selves say Lord it has to be you. I am utterly, absolutely nothing.
[time=2298] And the Lord will say it is for you that this happened. I have done this for you that I might demonstrate to you my power and it is for your friends that they may see my power in your life and it is for your disciples that they may also witness
[time=2313] and it is for the bystanders who come to watch. It is for you.
[time=2319] And that helps me as I think about the problems that come in my life. I am reminded through this experience that no man is an island and that whenever we experience a difficulty there are always those who are watching to see what God is going to do in our lives through the experience.
[time=2336] First of all we see in this passage of Scripture then the purpose of Jesus in all that is going to happen. May I say to you that even the great Westminster Confession of Faith reminds us that the only purpose we have on the face of this earth.
[time=2351] The epitome of all that we are about as Christians is that we might enjoy the Lord and glorify him and we might do it forever and consistently throughout the book that is illustrated.
[time=2365] Now I want you to notice secondly not only the purpose of Jesus in this great passage of Scripture but a most interesting part of the story, the postponement of Jesus.
[time=2374] I don't know if I can use the modern vernacular ever blown away by things you read in the Bible but sometimes when I am reading the Scripture and I see things written together they blow me away.
[time=2388] And I remember the first time I read the verses that I want to read for you now how they so surprised me. Notice verse 4 and 5 and 6.
[time=2399] Jesus heard that and he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified by it.
[time=2407] Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus when he heard therefore that he was sick he got in his car at 3 o'clock in the morning started it up and raced right to Bethany.
[time=2420] What does it say? He waited two days and I can't understand that.
[time=2429] You know we are all creatures of crisis are we not? Everything is an emergency.
[time=2435] I have pondered my twelve years of ministry and I can't remember very many emergencies but every one of them at the time was an emergency.
[time=2445] When I notice what Jesus is doing here I have to ask the question why did he delay.
[time=2452] Let me first of all remind you that in this passage of Scripture we are dealing in a context of love.
[time=2457] You remember when we began our study of the book of John we realized that oftentimes in the book John who writes the book is called the disciple whom Jesus loved.
[time=2468] And it has been interesting to me that this disciple whom Jesus loved in his writings likes to tell everybody about all the other people Jesus loved too.
[time=2477] John didn't think he had a corner on the love of God and so we read in this third chapter in this eleventh chapter that Jesus loved Lazarus he who now loves his dead that he loved Martha and that he loved Mary.
[time=2492] And in the context of love we see the Lord Jesus waiting.
[time=2498] There is a wonderful principle here that we ought to explore and that is the love of the Lord demonstrated in his delays.
[time=2509] Oh I need to hear this may you be well aware of the fact that whenever I preach to you it is always because first of all I have been preached to myself from the Word of God.
[time=2520] The love of God demonstrated through his delays. Why did the Lord wait for two days when he heard of the sickness of Lazarus before he went to Bethany that 38 mile journey to be with Mary and Martha and to minister to Lazarus.
[time=2538] Well there are a number of things we could conjecture perhaps it was out of indifference maybe the Lord really didn't care all but you know better than that for right here in this very context in the most well known verse in John.
[time=2554] And the one that is always recited first whenever there is a Bible verse memory drill John 1135 let's all say it together Jesus wept.
[time=2566] Jesus was not indifferent to the need for the Scripture says that when he arrived on the scene he became so emotionally involved in what was going on that he shed tears he wept.
[time=2578] Well you say maybe the Lord was preoccupied.
[time=2582] You know in the Old Testament story one of my favorite stories when Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel do you remember that.
[time=2592] And how Elijah let them go first to call down fire by their gods and Elijah in the tradition of a good fundamentalist preacher when the prophets failed he got satirical he began to criticize and make fun of them.
[time=2605] I mean if you've read that text lately you know he said well maybe you're God's asleep maybe that's why he has an answer.
[time=2614] I never saw this until this week and I hope you'll just let me understand with you that this is from the Scripture I want to tell you what it says there's another phrase there it says Elijah said to them maybe he is pursuing.
[time=2626] And I looked that up and you know what it means now I'm not being uncouth when I say this it's an Old Testament idiom that means maybe he is in the restroom.
[time=2636] Maybe you're God's in the restroom he says.
[time=2641] Oh my I never said anything that terrible about a liberal preacher in my life.
[time=2648] The Lord said through Elijah as he challenged the prophets he said maybe the problem is that your God is so preoccupied that he can't hear you.
[time=2655] That's why he has an answer.
[time=2657] I can promise you two things folks when God delays answering your need it is not because of his indifference it is not because of his preoccupation.
[time=2666] The only reason the Lord ever hesitates to answer and waits and delays to meet your need is out of one basic motivation because of his love.
[time=2679] That's what it says now Jesus loved Martha and her sister Lazarus therefore he abode today still.
[time=2690] I want to explore with you for a few moments the delays of love the delays of love.
[time=2700] What can happen in my life when God delays to answer.
[time=2705] First of all whenever God delays to meet the need on my time schedule one of the things that is happening in my life is that my my purposes are being clarified.
[time=2717] Sometimes when God stretches us out through waiting on him he causes us to go through a refining process so that as we think through what we're doing and we put them in perspective of what God is doing gradually they get into sync where they belong.
[time=2734] We ask God to do something in our behalf and we expect it to be done immediately and God waits and in that waiting process we are being refined and we are being structured to be in concert with God's will.
[time=2747] The second thing that happens when I'm asked to wait is this not only are my purposes clarified but my faith is certified.
[time=2756] In the Old Testament you remember the story of Abraham God said to him when he was a relative young man Abraham I want you to leave her of the counties and go out into a land that I will show you and I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you
[time=2770] and I'm going to do this all through a son that is born to you and Abraham waited and he was 40 and he was 50 and he passed Don Kruger's age and it still didn't happen and it was 60 and 70 and he was saying Lord if you're going to do it you better be doing it.
[time=2785] Yes.
[time=2790] And he got to be 90 and still no son.
[time=2793] Oh he got impatient once and with the help of his wife he went into his hand made and Ishmael came out of that and that's been a problem ever since.
[time=2803] And when it was beyond hope and the scripture said that he was as one dead he was impotent and his wife beyond the ability to bear children God answered and Isaac was born.
[time=2817] Do you know what was happened to Abraham during all that time?
[time=2822] He was learning to trust in God.
[time=2827] It is my experience that when God delays to answer us out of love he is in the process of stripping from us all of the human resources in which we can trust so that when the time has come there is no hope apart from God.
[time=2845] And then our faith is certified in him. The motivation for his delay was the motivation of love.
[time=2858] Someone has written and this is one of those pithy statements that you ought not ever to forget right in the table of your heart.
[time=2867] I think it summarizes what we have learned in this passage so far and it's this this is the statement.
[time=2873] God wants to teach us to learn to interpret the circumstances by the love of Christ rather than interpret the love of Christ by the circumstances.
[time=2885] How do you measure up there folks?
[time=2888] Do you find like me that on occasion you are prone to try to measure the love of Christ on the basis of your circumstances?
[time=2897] What God wants to teach us through the delays of love is that we should interpret the circumstances on the basis of his love to us, understanding that everything that happens to us is a part of God's plan if we are a part of his heart.
[time=2914] Now the scripture says that not only did he delay motivated by love but he delayed and his methodology was until exactly the right moment.
[time=2924] You say what do you mean past or the right moment? The scripture says Lazarus had been dead four days.
[time=2929] But you see that's the problem. We want to operate on our time schedule and he's operating on a heavenly time schedule.
[time=2938] You see in our day there are 24 hours. In God's day according to the scripture there are a thousand years.
[time=2944] We're always trying to get in to God's schedule and force it into our time.
[time=2949] Now the Bible says that at exactly the right time Jesus Christ walked into that situation.
[time=2955] I have an idea that he waited until Lazarus died till he had laid in state and finally was buried wrapped in the burial clothes and the tomb was shut so that his death was beyond death.
[time=2967] Beyond dispute so that no one could say oh you're just in a coma.
[time=2973] He waited long enough and the scripture is explicit. The scripture says he stunk.
[time=2980] The decomposition process had already started.
[time=2985] Jesus waited until there was absolutely no way anyone could ever interpret this miracle apart from the divine power of an almighty God.
[time=2995] And at that moment at just the right time he walked into the situation.
[time=2999] Just like he waited till the last minute to get Peter out of jail.
[time=3003] Remember that? The night before his execution.
[time=3008] Just like he comes to his disciples in that boat when the storm was just about to engulf them.
[time=3014] And you remember the miracle the Bible says he watched the whole thing just at the moment he walked in.
[time=3022] And that's what Jesus does in our lives too.
[time=3025] When the right moment is come he intercedes in our behalf.
[time=3030] Alexander McLaren has said so very poignantly that we are to remember that Heaven's clock is different from ours.
[time=3039] What seems long to us is to the Lord just a little while.
[time=3044] 48 hours, two days. That's how long he waited.
[time=3049] But God is never in haste. He never comes too soon or too late.
[time=3056] The Lord shall help us and that right early says the scripture.
[time=3063] In the last part of this section of scripture we have not only the purpose of Jesus and the postponement of Jesus but a very interesting pronouncement of Jesus.
[time=3073] And once again let me ask you to read two verses in conjunction with each other that when we see them together are startling indeed.
[time=3082] And those are verses 14 and 15. Let me read it for you and you listen.
[time=3088] Then said Jesus unto them plainly. Lazarus is dead and I am glad.
[time=3096] Wow. Doesn't that startle you? Lazarus is dead and I am glad.
[time=3105] I know that a lot of times when people are old and feeble and beyond the ability to care for themselves and they are lying in a bed someplace just wasting away.
[time=3114] That it is quite often proper for those who love someone like that to say it will be a blessing when they pass out of this suffering into the presence of the Lord.
[time=3124] I can understand that. But here is a man in the prime of his life.
[time=3130] And the Bible says Jesus comment on his death was Lazarus is dead and I am glad.
[time=3140] And I want to stop for just a moment to ponder those two statements taken together.
[time=3146] How could the Lord say that? Well first of all he said it for this reason.
[time=3151] He has likened Lazarus death to sleep and Jesus teaches us that death just like sleep for the Christian is harmless.
[time=3164] The psalmist says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil.
[time=3169] Paul says that we have victory over death through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3173] The Christian has nothing to fear from death. It is harmless to him.
[time=3177] It is simply the promotion out of one sphere of living into another sphere of living.
[time=3181] And when Jesus said Lazarus is dead and I am glad he said it with the full knowledge of that to which Lazarus had been promoted.
[time=3190] Sometimes people say to me when it says in John 11 35 Jesus wept and if Jesus knew he was going to resurrect Lazarus from the grave why does it say Jesus wept.
[time=3199] Let me give you a mind-blowing thought. I think Jesus wept because he knew what he was calling Lazarus back out of and what he was calling him back into.
[time=3209] And poor Lazarus he had to die twice. Did you ever think of that?
[time=3215] He died the first time he got resurrected and he had to go through the whole thing all over again.
[time=3219] We have no record that Lazarus ever lived and went to heaven without dying again.
[time=3223] And when Jesus thought of someone being translated out of the presence of an Almighty God in the place of paradise and back into this world he was grieved in his heart.
[time=3235] Jesus was glad when Lazarus died because death for the Christian is harmless.
[time=3240] Secondly death for the Christian is helpful.
[time=3245] You know what Revelation says? Revelation the last book in the Bible Revelation says that the death of a Christian the death of one who has died in Christ is blessed.
[time=3261] Blessed are they who die in the Lord for they shall cease from their labors and they shall be in the presence of the Lord.
[time=3272] When the Lord Jesus pronounced this blessing he simply said Lazarus is in the presence of God.
[time=3281] But of course the Scripture also adds that he was glad not just for Lazarus sake but for the sake of his disciples as we've already explored because unless there had been a death there couldn't have been a resurrection.
[time=3292] And Jesus knew what that miracle was going to do in the lives of his disciples.
[time=3297] You know we don't talk much about death in our culture. It is almost unspoken.
[time=3305] But it is the one thing we all have in common.
[time=3308] I can talk about some problems and I will hit certain percentages of the congregation and those who watch on television but men and women when I talk about death it touches every single one of us through our loved ones, our family and ultimately ourselves.
[time=3321] And there is good news in the Bible and that good news is this that if your trust is in Jesus Christ death is not an enemy, it's a friend.
[time=3329] Death does not come to take you by surprise it comes to take you into the presence of an Almighty God where you can be with him and enjoy his presence forever.
[time=3340] Lazarus illustrates that for you and for me. The key is this when you think about death does it bring a settled peace into your heart or fear?
[time=3353] If fear comes to your life when you think of death men and women it's because you're not ready to face it spiritually.
[time=3360] And that's a good test for you to take today shall we pray together.
[time=3370] Our heads bowed and our eyes closed. Let me ask this question. Do you know Christ as your Savior? When you think of death does it frighten you?
[time=3379] If it does it is because you have not put your trust in Christ for he has taken away the fear of death for everyone who will trust him.
[time=3387] If you do not know him today wherever you may be you can bow your head in a simple prayer say dear God.
[time=3393] I ask you by your son to forgive my sin and to give me the gift of eternal life.
[time=3399] Come into my heart and be my Savior and he will do it and he will do it now.
