[time=31] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=40] [[MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]]
[time=86] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=91] We welcome you to this service, and we're grateful for the privilege of having you here.
[time=96] Those of you who have joined us now by television, we're grateful for the opportunity we have to come into your homes and bring to you the Word of God a message of music from our musicians.
[time=106] This is the beginning of our 11th Annual Missionary Conference.
[time=110] We have a great service plan that will really be a blessing to you.
[time=113] There ought to be another time when I could do this in the service, but this is probably the best time because Pastor Kruger is out here.
[time=121] Most of you know that he and Janet have been looking forward to the birth of their third child.
[time=127] We thought it would never happen, but it did.
[time=130] Yesterday at noon, God gave to them a beautiful baby girl.
[time=135] And that's why he has that pink flower he's wearing around today.
[time=139] It replaced a big sign that he wore all week around the office that said, "Not yet on it."
[time=146] And Don has composed a little poem, and I want him to come and share that with you before the choir sings.
[time=153] Well, we're ecstatic just to think that God blessed us with something pink.
[time=160] When all along, we surely knew that this could be another blue.
[time=165] But when you think it comes from heaven, you gladly take whatever is given.
[time=171] But when you get just what you order, how you love that baby daughter.
[time=180] And the baby daughter's name is Julianne Elizabeth.
[time=193] Twenty-two and a half inches long, nine pounds and three ounces. That's why it took so long.
[time=201] We say congratulations to Janet, and thank God for this new addition to the family of our friends and loved ones, the Kruger's.
[time=210] Don is leading the choir now, as they sing.
[time=223] I want Jesus in my life, more than anything this will give of me.
[time=234] For I know that he alone can serve his power.
[time=245] Just to know who is leading in my life is worth every game that I might sacrifice.
[time=256] For I want Jesus more than anything.
[time=266] Take the thing that I might want, and all the things that seem so dear.
[time=276] I'd never have given any praise, let them make it to me.
[time=286] I want him to have control, and be the breath of life in me.
[time=296] I'd rather have Jesus, I'd rather have him than anything.
[time=306] As I go through life within, there could be no other way.
[time=317] I want Jesus more than anything.
[time=328] He had power without him, and the heavens he rode the universe.
[time=340] Countless angels waited on his every call.
[time=352] But one day I saw him all alone, on a road to death, and not told agony.
[time=363] Just for me he suffered, what a price he paid.
[time=375] Take the thing that I might want, and all the things that seem so dear.
[time=385] I'd rather have given any praise, let them make it to me.
[time=396] I want him to have control, and be the breath of life within me.
[time=406] I'd rather have Jesus, I'd rather have him than anything.
[time=416] As I go through life within, there could be no other way.
[time=427] I want Jesus more than anything.
[time=438] I want Jesus.
[time=446] Thank you, Choir.
[time=453] You're so happy to have as a part of the ministries of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=462] Some of you know this year we are graduating our first ever senior class, and there are a group of young men in this auditorium today that I want to pay tribute to.
[time=471] They are the members of the high school basketball team who participated Friday in Saturday, and the Association of Christian Schools International Great Lakes Region Tournament.
[time=483] And they played on Friday in Saturday, they were behind in both games most all of the way, and they clawed and scrapped their way to victory.
[time=492] And last night, for the fourth time this year, they played Fort Wayne Christian School, and defeated them 50-49 and won the championship.
[time=501] And these men are over here in this part of the building, which you guys stand up, coach long break, and let's give them a good hand, shall we?
[time=511] Turn around so they can see you.
[time=519] You'd be interested to know that our high school basketball team has just two seniors who play regularly on the team, and most of the men who are on the team are sophomores and freshmen, they've been playing a high school schedule.
[time=534] We had two seniors who transferred to another school in the middle of the year, and everyone sort of gave up hope, but they are 17 and 3, and they have honored our school and our Lord with the way they have played.
[time=546] Now, I have many friends at Fort Wayne Christian. Last Sunday night, after they beat us in the tournament here, I was in a pizza shop with my family, and they all came up and wanted to know why I didn't announce the score from the week before on television.
[time=559] And I shared with them that one of the joys of being a leader is the opportunity to choose which information you like to share.
[time=566] But in all fairness to them, I want to pay tribute to Fort Wayne Christian too.
[time=570] They're a fine group of young men. Two of them are from our church, and we love those boys, and they played exceptionally well all year, and we're all praying that we don't have to play each other again before the season is over.
[time=581] We're happy to share with you the ministry of music of Dick and Dottie Anthony.
[time=587] They've visited with us before and ministered to us in music.
[time=590] They're here for our missionary conference in the beginning days of this conference, and they're going to minister to us right now.
[time=600] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=751] We're so very happy to have you with us today, and we're thankful for the privilege we have of coming right into your home with the ministry of the Bible hour to share with you the Word of God and the music that exalts and glorifies our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=765] During these past weeks, we have been dealing with the subject of the deity of Jesus Christ. Donna, I have been preaching the Gospel of John and living it day and night, and we talk about it a lot at home, but it's a really an exciting study.
[time=780] Just a few minutes, I want to share with these people a very special offer that we have that will be of help to them in their study of the Gospel of John, but I know you have an associate sponsor you want to share with the folks at home, so why don't we do that first, and you tell them about the associate sponsor.
[time=796] Our associate sponsor for today is Grace Lickte from Bern Indiana, and she's sponsoring the Bible hour today on Channel 21, and we certainly say thank you to you for your part in the ministry this day.
[time=809] And the associate sponsorship means that she's given $100 toward the sponsoring of the program on the station in her area for this particular Sunday.
[time=817] We are in the associate sponsor time of our Bible hour year, and if you'd like information about how you can be a sponsor underwriting the cost of one station in your area, or an associate sponsor giving a gift of $100 to underwrite the cost of that station, simply get in touch with us at the number we'll give you in just a few moments.
[time=837] Now, before Donna shares some information about the Daily Walk, I'm excited to open up to you an opportunity for a very special new offer that we're sending out this coming week.
[time=848] It's a beautiful edition of the Gospel of John in the new international version, and it is special in this way.
[time=855] In the book are verses that are highlighted in green to indicate how important the doctrine of the deity of Christ is in John's Gospel.
[time=867] Now, let me explain.
[time=868] All of the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, have a very specific purpose.
[time=874] For instance, Matthew tells us about Jesus Christ the King.
[time=878] John's Gospel has as its central purpose the declaration of the deity of Christ. That means that Christ is God.
[time=885] There are many today who say that Christ is not God, that he was just a man.
[time=890] You cannot read John's Gospel without knowing for sure that Jesus Christ is God, and in this special edition of the Gospel of John, every single proof of the deity of Christ is underlined, highlighted in green.
[time=903] You can open up this new contemporary version, read through it, and have an overwhelming sense of the fact that Christ is God.
[time=911] We'd like to send this special edition of John's Gospel to every single one of you who will request it, and we will do it if you will call us at this toll-free number, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=923] When you call, ask for the special edition of the Gospel of John, and we'll send it out to you this week.
[time=929] Now, Donna, you have a word about the daily walk that you need to share.
[time=933] We try to say a little something about the daily walk each week, because we feel it's very important that as believers we spend time in God's word each day, and it's especially important.
[time=944] If you've just recently accepted Christ, you need to have a daily program of reading through the Scriptures, and that's what the daily walk is.
[time=952] If you would like to have a free copy of the daily walk, you just need to call us at the toll-free number, 1-800-45-39000, and we will send you a copy of the daily walk, and it gives you the passages of Scripture to read each day, and it gives an outline of what the material covers, and it's really a helpful tool, especially to new believers, and we'd be glad to send you a free copy.
[time=975] If you prefer, you may write to us, and our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=984] Donna, before we go back to the service, let me just remind you again that our free offer this month, along with the daily walk, is the Gospel of John in the new international version teaching the doctrine of the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=997] It's a great little booklet for you to have as you follow along in these special weeks of teaching and preaching on the Gospel of John, and I want to send one to you this week if you will call me at 1-800-45-39000, or write to us, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1015] Now it's time to go back to the service, some more music, and in just a moment, the world's greatest missionary text, John 3 16, right from the Gospel, a great text of Scripture that extols the love of God for each and every one of us.
[time=1045] You gave the cross of Jesus, I think we'll take my stand, the shadow of our mighty luck, within our weary land.
[time=1074] A home within the wilderness, a rest upon the way, from the burning of the untied youth, and the burden of the day.
[time=1104] Upon the cross of Jesus, my eyes at times can see, the very dying form of one who suffered me.
[time=1133] And from my smitten heart with tears, these wonders I confess, the wonder of his glorious love.
[time=1155] And my unwirly lips, I take a cross, I shadow for my abiding place.
[time=1183] I ask no other sunshine, than the sunshine of his face, content to let the world go by, to no no gain or loss.
[time=1209] My sinful self, my only shame, my glory on the cross, my glory.
[time=1238] We're glad to have with us in this service today missionaries from various parts of the country who are sharing with us in our eleventh annual missionary conference.
[time=1265] We're going to ask these couples to come and take one of the microphones here at each side of the podium, and we're going to ask that they introduce themselves to you so you'll be acquainted with them.
[time=1275] And they'll just go one after the other, and we'll listen to what they have to say about what God has done in their life to bring them here, what board they serve under, and where they're going to be ministering.
[time=1286] We're Dale and Karen Marshfield, and we're serving with the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism to the field of South Africa. We'll be involved in evangelism and church planning in that needy country.
[time=1297] I'm Don, and Betty, Ross, and we live in a normal Lake, Indiana, we're with Evangelical Baptist Missions in a film ministry called Harvest Productions, and we're producing films for use throughout the world in the language and the culture of the people.
[time=1313] I'm Nell Collins, missionary nurse with cancer patients, working to the goals of seeing people saved, seeing them get into the word, and get them into good fundamental churches, those who have been diagnosed with cancer.
[time=1326] I'm Don Fanning, we're the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism. We've been in Columbia for 12 years, and we've allowed us to plant several churches and work among Indians as we started with an aviation ministry, and now in a church planning and Bible Institute ministry.
[time=1342] Hi, I'm Tom Miller. I'm Nancy Miller.
[time=1346] And we are working with Campus Bible Fellowship, which is an organization under Baptist Midmissions. We're working with university students, both at the University of Northern Iowa, and at the University of Iowa.
[time=1357] And our goal is to lead them to Christ and then to disciple them by means of cycling them both in large group and small group Bible studies.
[time=1366] Let's welcome our missionaries to the black off Baptist Church.
[time=1380] And we understand Tom and Nancy being a little nervous about extending their missionary efforts into television, which I don't think they've ever done before, and all of us who know and love Nell Collins, doesn't she look great?
[time=1392] Have you seen now looking as good as she looks right now? Well, you gals get with her and find out how she did it. It was wonderful, and she's feeling just great, and she said she feels better and she's ever felt in her life.
[time=1403] She's had a real ministry here in our church to many people who have been touched with cancer.
[time=1409] We thank God for bringing her here as well as all of these other folks who are with us, and we're looking forward to a great three days together in our 11th Annual Conference.
[time=1417] Now, just before the message, we're going to hear from Dick Anthony as he shares with us from the keyboard and vocally a beautiful song with a missionary theme that will minister to your hearts as we prepare for the ministry of the Word of God.
[time=1447] This is a brilliant song to teach, the untaught, to bring the unwrapped. This is God's great command, to tell the untaught, to bring to the fold.
[time=1476] To let them behold the Christ, who died for every light.
[time=1501] There are souls who have never heard the message of God's own word.
[time=1514] The news that salvation is offered to all, who unjesus the Savior will call.
[time=1529] There are people across the sea, who from bondage could be set free.
[time=1541] If we would be willing to spend and be spent, that the nations would hear and repent.
[time=1565] To seek the unsought, to teach the untaught, to bring the unwrapped.
[time=1580] This is God's great command, to tell the untaught, to bring to the fold.
[time=1597] To let them behold the Christ, who died for every light.
[time=1627] Thank you Dick. Tonight in our service, for those of you who live in the Channel 21 area, for all of you who are here presently,
[time=1643] Dick and Adi will be sharing with us a very special multimedia missionary package, something like you've not ever seen before,
[time=1651] that has to do with the theme of our conference, and then along with that, in tonight's service, we'll be seeing the film "The Mountain of Light".
[time=1661] Dr. W.A. Chriswell has written of that film that it is the finest presentation of on-the-field missionary work he has ever seen,
[time=1669] a very dramatic presentation of what it's like to be involved in missions, and you'll want to be here to share in that.
[time=1677] To live in this area within driving distance, we encourage you to come and join with us at 7 o'clock.
[time=1682] Now our Bibles are open to John chapter 3, and for most of us, it will not be necessary for us to have the Scriptures.
[time=1689] For we are preaching today on probably the most familiar verse in all of the Bible, John chapter 3 verse 16.
[time=1698] I believe it is the greatest missionary text in all of God's Word.
[time=1703] I'd like for us to stand together now, and as we do, let us either read or recite from memory, John 3 16.
[time=1712] Shall we do it aloud together, John 3 16.
[time=1715] For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1729] And shall we pray? Father, we commit these next few moments into the control of the Spirit of God.
[time=1738] There is more than we could say in twice the time we have about this short verse of Scripture,
[time=1745] and we would ask that the major impact of these thy words will be brought home to our hearts today.
[time=1754] Lord, so often when we come face to face with the familiar, we tend not to be attentive.
[time=1762] We tend to back away in our concentration.
[time=1766] And I pray that in these moments, even though all of us here and many who watch by television are so familiar with this verse,
[time=1774] that you will give to us the attitude that we have never seen it before, that we have never read it before,
[time=1780] that we are understanding and comprehending it for the first time, and make its truth very clear to us we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1790] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1792] The historian, Pliny, once said that he saw the Iliad of Homer written in so small a character that it was contained in a nutshell.
[time=1809] A man by the name of Peter Bales, who lived in the days of Queen Elizabeth, once undertook the job of writing the Bible as small as he could.
[time=1819] He accomplished the unbelievable feat of writing the Scripture in so small a character that it was able to be contained in a walnut shell.
[time=1828] We listen to the feats like that of a day gone by and we say why that's nothing, in our modern computer age, we can contain volumes of information on spaces so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye.
[time=1842] Yet men and women, I have something to share with you today that is more amazing than all of that.
[time=1847] For here in this verse of Scripture, which we are about to study, is all of the truth of God's word condensed into just a few sentences.
[time=1857] It is, in my estimation, the greatest verse in all of the Bible for it contains all of the Bible in one verse.
[time=1865] If you could read it understanding its supremacy, you would read it like this.
[time=1870] God, the greatest lover, so loved the greatest degree.
[time=1876] The world, the greatest company, that he gave the greatest act, his only begotten son, the greatest gift.
[time=1886] That whosoever, the greatest opportunity, believe it, the greatest simplicity, in him, the greatest attraction, should not perish, the greatest promise.
[time=1900] But, the greatest difference, have the greatest certainty, everlasting life, the greatest possession.
[time=1909] All of that in one verse. In fact, I was reading an old, old commentary that someone gave to me this week and found the most amazing thing about this verse.
[time=1921] Not only does it say the gospel, but it has the gospel written right within its letters.
[time=1927] Look at your Bibles, now will you? And notice, God, there's the G.
[time=1933] So loved the world that he gave his only, there's the O. Begotten son, there's the S.
[time=1941] That whosoever, believe it, in him, should not perish, there's the P.
[time=1947] But have everlasting, there's the E, life, there's the L, G-O-S-P-E-L, the gospel in John 3 16.
[time=1958] And in my Bible, I have highlighted those letters. Just as another reminder to me that this simple verse of scripture is God's wonderful message to all of mankind.
[time=1969] Martin Luther said that John 3 16 was the heart of the Bible and the gospel in minuture.
[time=1976] G. Campbell Morgan said that this is a text I have never attended to preach on.
[time=1981] Though I have gone around it and around it, it is too big. When I read it, there is nothing else to say.
[time=1989] I find I just wish I knew how to read it better than I do.
[time=1993] So as to produce a sense in the ears of the people, if I could do that, he said there would be nothing left to preach about.
[time=2002] Henry Morehouse began preaching when he was 16 years of age and he died in his young thirties.
[time=2009] And it was said of him that every time he stood to preach, he would open his Bible and say, "My text is John 3 16."
[time=2017] And he preached on John 3 16, all of his life wherever he went.
[time=2022] One preacher that I read about became so enamored with this verse of scripture that he spent his lifetime collecting outlines of the verse.
[time=2030] And when he died, he had over 600 different outlines of John 3 16.
[time=2036] "It is not surprising to me that so much truth can come out of such a pregnant verse filled every wit with the truth of God and of his redemption for mankind."
[time=2048] When Paul wrote to the Ephesians in chapter 3 in verse 18, he contained in his writing a prayer for that wonderful church.
[time=2056] This is what he said. He said, "I pray that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints the height and the breadth and the length and the depth of the love of Christ."
[time=2069] I don't know if Paul was under the impression of John 3 16, but if he was, he certainly could have turned at that moment to give them instruction.
[time=2079] For in John 3 16, we have the breadth of God's love for God's whole of the world.
[time=2086] And we have the length of his love. He went to the length of sending his own son.
[time=2092] And we have the depth of his love, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish.
[time=2097] He came that far and went that low, and we have the height of his love, but have everlasting life.
[time=2105] In John 3 16 is all of God's love. Perhaps there is no verse in all of the Bible that is explained as much as this one.
[time=2113] And yet at the same time, there is no verse that should be explained so little.
[time=2119] Most young preachers I know have three or four sermons on John 3 16.
[time=2124] As we get older, we find it more and more difficult to preach on its truth.
[time=2129] I have to admit that almost 14 years of preaching the gospel I have never preached on John 3 16.
[time=2135] There is something about it that makes us want to take off our shoes because we recognize we are on holy ground.
[time=2141] Here is a verse that is so profound, it is beyond description.
[time=2146] It is so simple that even a child can understand its truth.
[time=2151] It is the world's greatest text because it describes in the most poignant way the world's greatest message.
[time=2160] And that is the message of the love of God.
[time=2162] I want you to look at it with me for just a moment, taking it every word at a time.
[time=2167] First of all, we learn at the beginning of this verse that the love of God is expressive in its action.
[time=2174] God so loved.
[time=2177] In the mind of men then and now, the comprehension of a loving God was unbelievable.
[time=2185] For in the world in which John wrote, God was considered to be a God of terror and of wrath.
[time=2192] A God who needed to be propitiated with the sacrifices of children and of animals.
[time=2197] They looked at God as a God who was waiting to drive men to hell instead of wooing them to heaven.
[time=2204] And even today on the mission field, there are those who throw their babies into the Ganges River as a sacrifice to propitiate their God.
[time=2213] Or like in the Old Testament, bring their children to the God Molech offering their babies as a fiery sacrifice in order to make their God less angry.
[time=2223] And yet John says this God loved.
[time=2228] That must have been an astounding truth for the readers of this gospel.
[time=2233] For the ones who heard him preach that wonderful message.
[time=2237] That God was not a God who was waiting to vent his wrath, but rather a God who was willing to love men into his kingdom.
[time=2246] Oh, it is true that the wrath of God is here. It is found in one word. It's the word perish.
[time=2252] But will you notice that in this text we see the love of God super abounding the wrath of God?
[time=2258] God's so loving so that his wrath will not have to be given to men.
[time=2263] God's saying if you will accept my love, my wrath will not have to be brought to bear in your life.
[time=2270] This love of God is expressive. God so loved.
[time=2275] Someone has written that the word so here is the biggest little word in the Bible.
[time=2280] I think it's true. For in this little word is contain all of the agonies of the cross.
[time=2288] It means God's soul. He loved us like this. This is how God loved.
[time=2293] This is the extent to which God loved.
[time=2296] God's so loved is to cause all heaven to wonder and all hell to tremble.
[time=2301] God's so loved is to include everyone who would come to his love and receive of it.
[time=2307] Years ago we had the privilege of visiting London for a Baptist conference that was there
[time=2313] and one of the sites that we saw was St. Paul's Cathedral.
[time=2317] In St. Paul's Cathedral there is a statue, a life-sized marble statue of Christ
[time=2323] writhing in anguish on the cross and inscribed underneath that statue are these words.
[time=2329] This is how God loved the world.
[time=2333] God's so loved in that way that he demonstrated his love in a real and physical manner.
[time=2340] In this verse is the word agape. We've run into that before, have we not?
[time=2346] It is the greatest word in the Greek language for the love of God.
[time=2350] Here in John's writing it appears for the first time.
[time=2354] It is found 36 times in the rest of John's gospel, some 31 times in 1 John.
[time=2360] It reminds us that this John who writes this message to us is the apostle of love and he speaks of the agape love of God, a love which demonstrates itself in seeking the best interest of the one loved.
[time=2373] God's so loved us in such a way.
[time=2375] No wonder John wrote later when he wrote the first epistle, "Behold what manner of love."
[time=2381] The Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.
[time=2387] This indeed is the expressive action of God's love, but notice secondly the extraordinary choice of God's love.
[time=2396] For God's so loved, who the world?
[time=2401] The extraordinary thing about that men and women is that such a word should ever fall from the lips of a Jewish writer.
[time=2408] The ancient Hebrew was the true aristocrat of his day.
[time=2412] He looked with proud disdain on every Gentile.
[time=2418] But John a Jewish man said that God's love is not bound to the narrow bonds of
[time=2424] Palestine, but rather it reaches out to the whole world.
[time=2428] What world was he talking about?
[time=2430] The word cosmos, which is the word world, is used often to describe many things.
[time=2435] It talks about the world of nature and certainly God loved that.
[time=2439] He said it was good.
[time=2440] It talks about the world, which is in an evil sense understood.
[time=2444] And God loved that world.
[time=2446] But most of all in this passage, when God loves the world, it is talking about the fact that he loved the world of men, of individuals.
[time=2455] He did not love a nation.
[time=2456] He did not love a good people.
[time=2458] He loved individual men.
[time=2460] And the world of men was the object of his love and of his concern.
[time=2466] He loved those who were unlovable and would not love him back.
[time=2470] He loved those who were lonely and did not know that there was one in the world who knew of their need.
[time=2477] He loved the ones who never thought of God.
[time=2480] He loved the ones who dwelt upon God.
[time=2482] He loved every man from every tribe and every nation and every tongue.
[time=2487] God loved the world of men.
[time=2490] In your bulletins today, those of you here in the auditorium, you will notice that I have included some statistics.
[time=2496] That ought to cause us to wonder in our own minds if the love of God for the world of men is really being reflected today in the church, which is his body.
[time=2505] For these statistics remind us that there are 1,448 ministers per million people in the United States,
[time=2514] only 56 missionaries per million in Africa, only 30 per million in Korea, only 15 per million in India,
[time=2522] and in Europe with its 480 million people, there is hardly any evangelization going on that could even be computed statistically.
[time=2531] And yet the Bible says God loves the world.
[time=2534] Modern Americans think that perhaps he has a special dispensation of love for us, the white Americans,
[time=2540] the ones who have grown up in this country where God is known.
[time=2544] But the missionary endeavor is to take the love of God for the world and make it known beyond these boundaries out there where they have never yet heard.
[time=2553] When God said he loved the world of men, he was not saying just the men of the United States, just the English-speaking men.
[time=2561] He was talking about all the world and he loves them as much as he loves us, the only difference is that the love of God that is being shed abroad in our hearts has yet to reach out where they are.
[time=2572] Because we're doing such a pitiful job of sharing the love of God in the world.
[time=2579] Now let me say to you very clearly, when the Bible says that God loves the world, he is not simply diminishing his love for you and getting it lost in a great big crowd.
[time=2590] It is an amazing thing that no man can love a multitude like he loves an individual, but God can, let me explain.
[time=2599] I love this church. I really do. I love the Black Hawk Baptist Church. I love the people in this church, but you know, I cannot love you the way I love my son.
[time=2609] I cannot really. The more I try, it becomes impossible. When I pick up, for instance, Daniel and a hole in my arms and I say, "Daniel, I love you. I love him somehow in a different way than I love all of you."
[time=2622] Most of you know that I am a patriot, a great lover of America, and I love this country, but I cannot love the people of this country the way I love my daughter.
[time=2632] It is beyond the capability of human love to love the masses as the individual is loved. Yet in God's love, though it encircles and encompasses the multitudes, it never fails to love the individual.
[time=2649] Jesus was moved to the depths of his heart with the love for the masses. He had compassion on the multitudes, but we see him in his ministry stopping along the way to minister to the individual.
[time=2661] He died on the cross. The Scripture says for the world. But do you remember that while he was hanging there, the sacrifice propitiating the sin of the world, he stopped for a moment to give his heart to one who hung beside him individually, who he loved.
[time=2676] Jesus Christ, as St. Augustine says, loves each of us as if there were only one of us to love. I don't understand that.
[time=2687] But I want to share with you that it's true. God loves you as if you were the only one in the world for him to love because he is infinite. He can impress and compress his infinite love into finite time and make it one-on-one for everyone in this world.
[time=2708] No man loves like God loves. He loved the world.
[time=2715] I want to share with you thirdly that God's love is not only expressive in its action, but it is also expensive in its sacrifice.
[time=2727] I hear people talk about love sometimes, and I have to wonder whether they really understand what it means. Have you ever had anyone come up to you and say,
[time=2737] not in a spirit of loving confrontation, but rather in a negative and derogatory way?
[time=2744] I just want you to know that I love you. And then, bam, they hit you right between the eyes and wipe you out with something that they should never have said in the first place.
[time=2753] Everybody do that? Oh, that happens to me every week, just about. I get so much love I can hardly stand it.
[time=2761] And you say, well, something's wrong. You see, love is always an activity. It is always an action.
[time=2772] It always has to be demonstrated in reaching out, in touching, in somehow communicating that love.
[time=2779] If God so loved the world and he sat up there on his throne in glory and never reached down to a lost man, we would have reason to doubt his love.
[time=2789] Men and women, the scripture says, God so loved that he gave his only begotten son.
[time=2796] God's love is demonstrated in the gift of his love to mankind.
[time=2800] Now, the word only begotten. Monogon Ace is a word which sometimes is used by the heretics to teach that Jesus Christ was a person born in the manger and had his beginning there.
[time=2815] He was the only begotten son of the father. He came into being at Bethlehem. That is not true.
[time=2820] The word Monogon Ace in this text means the unique one, the unique son of God, the son of God who is different than any other one, whoever there was.
[time=2830] He is the one of a kind son of God, the God man, the man God, the son of man, the son of God, combined forever in one person, the unique son of God.
[time=2843] There was only one, there will only be one, there is only one now, and it was that son of God that God gave to this world to demonstrate his love for us, the sacrifice of his love.
[time=2856] There was a missionary once who was telling this story to a native tribe who had never before heard of the love of God.
[time=2862] They didn't know anything about Jesus Christ. He announced his text having translated it into the language of the native and he read John 3 16.
[time=2871] And when he finished, one of the natives said to him, "Is that really true? Is that really true?"
[time=2878] And the missionary began to affirm and repeat, "Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true."
[time=2884] And the native asked, "If it's true, how then can you so glibly say it without tears in your eyes?"
[time=2893] Isn't it interesting how familiar we are with the love of God?
[time=2897] We can sing of it and speak of it and read of it as if it were as common as the news in today's newspaper instead of the eternal fact of the universe around which all of the world revolves and around which your life and mine and the lives of all in this world should be focused.
[time=2918] God so loved the world that he gave. Now, here's the good news. What did he give his son? And for whom? What does it say?
[time=2926] God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that what? Whosoever. Whosoever. You know what that means?
[time=2934] That means that God's gift of love is extensive in its offer.
[time=2939] It reaches as far as the furthest missionary has ever gone and it starts right in your own life and in your home.
[time=2947] Its center is where you are. Its circumference is as far as you can dream.
[time=2951] It includes every man who has ever lived, every man who is living now, and every man who will ever live.
[time=2957] It means that when Christ died on the cross, he paid the full price for every man's redemption so that no man can ever say, "I did not get to heaven because no atonement was made for me."
[time=2969] There is a doctrine sometimes accorded to the Calvinistic theory of thinking that says that Christ only died for the elect or he only died for those who would believe.
[time=2980] There is only one problem with that doctrine. It violates the Word of God. For God said, Christ died for the whole world.
[time=2990] That means he died for you and you and you. You say, "Are you sure?" That means me.
[time=2996] I read with interest a story that came out of the life of Walter Wilson.
[time=3007] He tells about a man, a certain Mr. Klein who was discouraged and defeated, convinced that life wasn't worth living.
[time=3015] He thought himself to be perhaps one of the awfulest people who ever lived.
[time=3020] One night he walked by a church when the evening service was in progress and the windows were open and the doors were open and they were singing this song, saved by grace alone.
[time=3030] This is all my plea. Jesus died for all mankind and Jesus died for me. His hearing wasn't very good.
[time=3040] So when the congregation came to the words, Jesus died for all mankind. He thought they were singing. Jesus died for old man Klein and he was interested.
[time=3050] And he went in and he found out that what they were singing wasn't what he thought they were singing, but it really was.
[time=3057] For in all mankind was included old man Klein. And in Jesus, whosoever is included every individual who has ever lived and it includes you.
[time=3068] It means that none are excluded thence, but those who do themselves exclude, welcome the learned, the polite, the ignorant and the rude.
[time=3078] Every man, no matter who he is, is in the whosoever. That's true. It is extensive in its reach.
[time=3086] God's whosoever reaches as far as the arms of God can reach, but notice it's exclusive in this way.
[time=3095] For right after the word whosoever, God brings his arms back in and he says whosoever what? Believe it.
[time=3103] Is it true that God died for every man in the world and that all men are saved?
[time=3108] Well, the doctrine of universalism teaches that the world is all converted and they just need to be told.
[time=3114] But that is not what the Bible says. The Bible says that his death was sufficient for every man, but it is efficient for only those who will believe.
[time=3124] Christ died for you and his death paid the penalty for your sin, but it only works for you if you believe, if you receive what he did for you on the cross.
[time=3137] That's why it's a terrible tragedy for the tribes and nations of the world to have all of this truth out here that has never been brought down here so they can understand and believe.
[time=3150] Now the Bible says that when we believe, we shall not perish. That is the wrath of God in this verse, and I suppose we could call that the exceptional work of God's love should not perish.
[time=3163] Some people think that perishing means to be annihilated. There are cults that teach that when you die, you die like a dog and go in the grave.
[time=3170] But the word perish is the ant in them to the word eternal life. It means that if you believe, you will not be forever separated from God.
[time=3180] Someone wrote that a little girl was reciting John 3 16 and she recited it this way. God so loved the world that he gave his only forgotten son.
[time=3190] It was a mistake, but it was still the truth. For you see, when God turned his back on Jesus Christ, he forgot his son, and he did that. In order that he right remember you.
[time=3200] He paid the price of separation from God so that you wouldn't have to pay that, and that's what it means to perish, to be separated from God forever.
[time=3209] God so loved the world that whosoever believe in his son would not have to be separated from God.
[time=3216] But what does this scripture say? Have as the alternative everlasting life. Say when does that begin?
[time=3223] The old Puritans used to write on their tombstones. Born 1792, entered into eternal life 1835. Great tombstone thought, but very bad theology.
[time=3235] You enter into eternal life the moment you believe. You see, eternal life begins the moment you accept Christ as your Savior.
[time=3241] The moment you say, "I know you love me, God, and you sent Christ to die for me, and I receive your gift into my life through faith, I accept Christ."
[time=3249] That moment, eternal life begins, and it never ends. It goes on and on and on into the eons, thousands and hundreds of thousands of years beyond your ability to understand eternal life.
[time=3263] Now to say all of that, about the love of God from one verse is not even to touch the hem of the garment of this truth.
[time=3272] God loves the world, and his love demonstrated in his son, thrush missionaries out to every corner of the world to tell them about God's love.
[time=3283] Say have you ever heard the song, the love of God? We used to sing it more than we do now. A great, great gospel song.
[time=3291] Whenever you see it printed, there will always be a little asterisk, next to the second verse.
[time=3297] For the second stanza was written by an inmate in an insane asylum.
[time=3303] After that poor wretch died, they went into the cell where he had lived, and they found the words of the second stanza written on the wall.
[time=3312] Those words go like this. If we would think the ocean fill, and were the sky a parchment made, if every stalk on earth were a quill, and every man ascribed by trade, to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry.
[time=3334] Nor could the scroll contain the whole, though stretched from sky to sky, whole love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong, it shall forever more endure.
[time=3349] The saints and angels song, written by a wretch, and in a saint asylum, but the love of God reached to him.
[time=3359] It is not surprising to me that in a few moments, I cannot adequately describe God's love.
[time=3367] But I can say it as John said it. God so loved you that he gave his only begotten son that if you believe, you may have everlasting life and not perish.
[time=3380] Will you do it? Will you do it? Will you accept his gift and receive his love? Shall we pray?
[time=3388] Father, thank you for your love, and in these moments as we conclude our service, help us to understand it.
[time=3397] Those of you who are watching by television at home, let me say this to you clearly. God really loves you. He sent his son to die for you.
[time=3406] He's only waiting for you to believe, and you can do that right now if you will just bow your head and say, "Dear God, I accept the gift of your son Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=3416] Come into my life. Be my Savior. Give me the gift of eternal life. Thank you for being my Savior. I receive you today."
[time=3425] And if you do that, will you write us and let us know so that we can help you grow in your new faith and get you started in the life as a Christian?
