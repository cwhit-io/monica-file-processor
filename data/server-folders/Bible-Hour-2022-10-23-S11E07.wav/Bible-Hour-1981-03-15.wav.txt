[time=27] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=37] [ Singing ]
[time=69] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=74] The purpose of our gathering is to proclaim the glory and the greatness of our God.
[time=80] That's why it's such an exciting way to begin a service by singing that message with all of our hearts,
[time=86] concerning the greatness and majesty of our Lord.
[time=90] This is the second morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and it's special in this regard that it provides an opportunity for us to share with those of you at home the ministry of the gospel in music and in message.
[time=103] We're glad that you've joined with us today to be a part of this service, and we trust it will be a blessing to you even as God uses us in our own lives here.
[time=112] Right now we listen to the ministry of our choir under the direction of Don Kruger as they sing about the love of God.
[time=119] [ Singing ]
[time=145] And now we listen to the love of God so rich and free.
[time=157] [ Singing ]
[time=183] To suffer there for you and me.
[time=193] [ Singing ]
[time=212] How God set his fire.
[time=217] O silver in his own.
[time=221] Make him your holy love.
[time=226] Don't you refrain, you'll die along my spring.
[time=234] [ Singing ]
[time=260] To suffer there for you and me.
[time=271] [ Singing ]
[time=297] In the word of God we read that the Lord Jesus, that God inhabits the praise of his people.
[time=305] It's a beautiful picture of the people of God creating a sanctuary out of their praise for God.
[time=312] And he lives within that.
[time=315] When we come together for worship we come to praise the Lord.
[time=318] And David Miller is going to come and share with us now a song of rich encouragement
[time=324] about the importance of praising the Lord as Christians as we praise him together with our lives and with our words.
[time=333] [ Singing ]
[time=355] When you're up against a struggle that has shattered all your dreams and your hopes have been cruelly crushed
[time=365] by Satan's manifested schemes, when you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fears,
[time=376] don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear, praise the Lord.
[time=386] He can work through those who praise him, praise the Lord.
[time=393] For our God inhabits praise, praise the Lord.
[time=399] For the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
[time=409] when you praise him.
[time=416] Now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us think that we are paupers when he knows himself
[time=426] we're the children of the King.
[time=429] So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won.
[time=435] We know that Jesus Christ is risen so the works already done, praise the Lord.
[time=445] He can work through those who praise him, praise the Lord.
[time=451] For our God inhabits praise, praise the Lord.
[time=458] For the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
[time=467] when you praise him.
[time=474] Praise the Lord.
[time=477] He can work through those who praise him, praise the Lord.
[time=484] For our God inhabits praise, praise the Lord.
[time=490] For the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
[time=499] when you praise him.
[time=529] We're so happy to have you with us on the Bible Hour today and we thank you for joining us
[time=537] for this presentation of the Word of God in the worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=542] I know you've enjoyed the music already and Donna and I really have a good time sharing with you the things that are so very important to you as a part of our extended congregation watching there in your own homes.
[time=553] Donna today is a beginning again for the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=558] We are starting a whole new outreach through radio and during the next few weeks I know that it's our
[time=566] desire to share with our friends at home just two or three of the stations that the Bible Hour will be carried on in the radio version.
[time=574] I want to tell them about one and you're going to tell them about another.
[time=578] We're going to be on a station in Baltimore, Maryland, WRBS FM Sundays at 7.30 a.m. in Baltimore, Maryland.
[time=588] This past week in the Bible Conference Ministry I met some people from Baltimore who said they're going to be sure to join us
[time=594] every Sunday morning at 7.30 a.m.
[time=597] And the Bible Hour is also going to be on the station in Sebring, Florida.
[time=602] That's W-S-K-P-F-M on Sunday mornings at eight o'clock.
[time=607] Donna, there are eleven stations that are carrying the Bible Hour on radio beginning today.
[time=612] This is the first Sunday for its ministry across the country.
[time=616] And I know that many of you who are watching at home have friends who live in areas of the country where you cannot get the television version of the Bible Hour.
[time=623] So if you will write to us and request a radio schedule, we'll be happy to send one to you so that you will know where the Bible Hour is heard
[time=631] and maybe you can write to a friend or loved one and encourage them to listen and be a part of the ministry that God has raised up.
[time=636] Now along with the outreach of radio and television, we are also very much concerned about the outreach of literature.
[time=644] Donna has some things she wants to share with you about your involvement in the Word of God on a daily basis.
[time=651] It's never too late to begin your journey through the Word of God.
[time=655] And that is one of the advantages of using the daily walk because you can start at any month and if you read for one year,
[time=662] you will read through the entire scriptures in one year.
[time=666] Beginning this next month, you'll start reading in the book of First Kings and it gives you an assignment to read each day.
[time=674] And then one special portion under each day is called Insight.
[time=679] And this gives you a special insight into the portion of God's Word that you have read for that day.
[time=684] And it's really helpful. We get many comments from people on this particular section of how it has been used to help them in their daily lives.
[time=692] And we'd like to send you a free copy of the daily walk and all you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=702] Ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like to receive a free copy of the daily walk.
[time=708] Donna, we have been getting so many interesting letters from people who were involved in that course of study.
[time=713] A doctor recently wrote to me and shared with me how he had gotten excited about the Old Testament scriptures and had gone through
[time=720] the Old Testament reading and looking for medical terms and had made a long list of the terms he found just because he got excited about reading the Word of God.
[time=729] Many, many people are studying with us in the daily walk and if you are interested in getting into a Bible study program,
[time=735] this is an excellent way for you to begin. We're happy to help you in that way.
[time=739] We'd also like to encourage you to call or write for this special edition of the Gospel of John, which we have prepared specifically for this time in our ministry since we are studying John's Gospel.
[time=750] This modern version of John's Gospel not only contains all of the Gospel narrative,
[time=756] but it is marked in a very interesting fashion.
[time=759] For instance, throughout the Gospel there is underlined verses which affirm the deity of Christ, which as you know is the purpose of John's Gospel.
[time=768] Then there are some verses which are shaded and these accent the good news of God's forgiveness and his gift of eternal life.
[time=775] Then in the Gospel itself are some bold verses and these are the verses which are specifically helpful to you in your growth as a Christian.
[time=784] There are three different markings in this little pocket sized Gospel of John that will cause the book to come alive in your own life,
[time=792] not just so that you know the truth, but that you'll be able to do the truth as well.
[time=796] We'd like to send this to you as our free gift during this month, the Gospel of John in a modern version underlined and highlighted for your own spiritual growth and development.
[time=807] Once again, if you're interested in having this as your own, all you need to do is call us at 1-800-45-39000 and request this free booklet.
[time=815] We're happy to send it to you as soon as we get your request.
[time=818] Donna has a sponsor that she wants to share with us, someone who has helped to underwrite today's program in their area, so why don't you do that now.
[time=827] Okay, we have an associate sponsor today and it's Oscar Weaver from Goshen, Indiana, and he's sponsoring the Bible Hour today in the South Bend area.
[time=836] And we certainly thank you, Mr. Weaver, for your part in sharing the Gospel with many hundreds of folks today.
[time=843] Before we go back to the service, let me give you the address in the phone number once more.
[time=847] If you'd like to have your free copy of the Daily Walk or this special edition of the Gospel of John, or if you need information about the sponsors program,
[time=856] all you need to do is call us at 1-800-453-9000.
[time=860] That's an absolutely free call from any place in the United States and our operators are waiting to receive your message.
[time=867] If you would prefer to write, simply write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=874] We'd love to hear from you this week.
[time=876] We hope that you'll take time to get in touch with us and close the communication cycle as we've reached out to you today.
[time=883] You reach back with your message of encouragement and your request for literature.
[time=890] [MUSIC - 186 seconds]

[time=1100] Well, in a few moments, we're going to get Lazarus out of his grave, and that's good music for doing it, isn't it?
[time=1106] And that'll be all right. Thank you, quartet.
[time=1108] Just before the message, we're going to listen to Keith Brodigum, who he's going to come and share with us a song that focuses in on the subject of today's sermon,
[time=1117] which happens to be the subject of New Life in Christ, Resurrection Life.

[time=1323] (applause)
[time=1331] Open your Bibles with me this morning to the 11th chapter of John's Gospel.
[time=1335] John chapter 11, and we're reading today from the 11th chapter of John, beginning at verse 36 and concluding with the 44th verse.
[time=1348] John 11, 36 to 44.
[time=1353] I am so pleased when we read the Scripture together.
[time=1357] It is a feeling of unity and oneness in the things of the Word of God.
[time=1362] If you are here without a Bible, many times we sort of leave home in a hurry and forget to pick up a copy of the Scripture, somebody near you has one you can share, and we're going to read out loud together this portion of God's Word.
[time=1374] So let's all stand, shall we? Everyone's standing.
[time=1378] And reading aloud together, John chapter 11, beginning at verse 36.
[time=1384] "Then said the Jews, behold how he loved him." And some of them said, "Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind
[time=1394] have caused that even this man should not have died?
[time=1398] Jesus therefore again, groaning in himself, cometh to the grave.
[time=1404] It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it." Jesus said, "Take away the stone.
[time=1410] Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead for days."
[time=1421] Jesus said unto her, "said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe,
[time=1427] thou shouldest see the glory of God." Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me,
[time=1442] and I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the people who stand by,
[time=1449] I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me." And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."
[time=1461] And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes,
[time=1467] and his face was bound with a cloth.
[time=1470] Jesus saith unto them, "loose him and let him go." And shall we pray together?
[time=1477] Our God in heaven, we have read from thy word that portion which we determined to study together this morning.
[time=1485] And we ask that you will open our minds and our hearts that we might, first of all, see what is here.
[time=1492] Then that we might understand what it means.
[time=1496] And thirdly, that we may apply it to our own hearts in all honesty and with courage,
[time=1502] so that leaving here today we will be different people than those who walked into this auditorium this morning.
[time=1509] We pray for those who are sharing in our service by way of television and radio.
[time=1514] And we ask our God that you will use the spoken word as it is preached, as it touches them wherever they may be, to encourage and help and strengthen, to bring conviction, most of all to bring about change.
[time=1528] Let's Lord even resurrection in the lives of lost men and women.
[time=1532] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1538] Several weeks ago, we opened our Bibles to the Gospel of John to begin a series of messages on the sign miracles of John's gospel.
[time=1548] We began by understanding that the key to this great book is found in the 20th chapter, verses 30 and 31, where we are told that many other signs did Jesus, which are not written here, but these are written that she might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life through his name, John chapter 20.
[time=1568] We then began to explore John's gospel and discovered that there were seven miracles which John used to demonstrate the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=1578] We began in the second chapter with the miracle at the marriage, and we learned about our Savior that he is as at home in a place of happiness as he is in a place of sorrow, that he is interested in our homes as well as our happiness.
[time=1593] We moved to the fourth chapter, verses 46 to 54.
[time=1597] There we discussed together the Savior and the Senator's Son, and we learned that Jesus is able to deal with sickness, and he does not need to be near at hand.
[time=1606] He can do it from a distance.
[time=1608] Then we moved to the fifth chapter, and we studied together the paralytic at the pool.
[time=1613] There we saw a picture of the hopelessness and helplessness of a man apart from God, a picture that is a wonderful illustration of an individual who does not know Jesus Christ as his Savior.
[time=1626] We moved to the sixth chapter and the first few verses, and that beautiful story of the feeding of the five thousand.
[time=1632] There we learned that Jesus Christ, who claimed to be the bread of life, was indeed what he said he was.
[time=1638] He demonstrated it in the physical realm by multiplying a few loaves and fishes into enough food to feed over fifteen thousand people.
[time=1647] In that same chapter is the story of the walking on the water, a most magnificent revelation of the power of God over all of nature.
[time=1656] We learned some of us to our surprise that in that one miracle, there were four miracles, each of them demonstrating the power of Almighty God over the nature which surrounded Christ the Son of God.
[time=1670] And then recently we turned to the ninth chapter and discussed the miracle of the boy born blind, a most wonderful miracle, and apart from the one we are now studying the most important miracle in John's Gospel.
[time=1683] For it is a miracle which demonstrates the ability of Christ to back up his commitment with his work.
[time=1690] Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." And he proved it in the physical realm by lifting the scales of blindness from a man who was born with congenital blindness.
[time=1701] Now we're in the eleventh chapter, and a few weeks ago we began to unfold this most magnificent of all of the seven miracles.
[time=1709] We discussed together that it is the most important miracle, and we understand that first of all by the length of its account, 46 verses are used to tell the story.
[time=1719] It is told in beautiful detail.
[time=1721] It is far longer than any of the other miracles which we have studied.
[time=1725] We learned the importance of this miracle by examining the result that it had on the people who surrounded the family of Lazarus when this miracle took place.
[time=1736] But we also need to understand that this miracle is of signal importance because it forms a bridge between one section of John's Gospel and the next.
[time=1745] The first eleven chapters of the Gospel of John deal with Christ in his public ministry.
[time=1751] Here he is performing before the Jews, making an impact on the hearts of the public.
[time=1757] But beginning in the twelfth chapter, he retreats from his public ministry and he begins to deal specifically with the disciples.
[time=1764] The miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus is a bridge from the first section of the Gospel into the second.
[time=1771] And you will see how very beautifully this is preserved even in the account for present when Christ called Lazarus from the grave were both the Jews who represented the first account and the disciples who will now be the subject of Christ's work in the second part of the Gospel.
[time=1788] So the miracle of John which records the resurrection of Lazarus is a very
[time=1794] important part of the overall purpose of this great Gospel.
[time=1799] Now the miracle itself is divided into three sections and that's why we've taken three Sundays to discuss it.
[time=1805] In verses 1 through 16 we read of the announcement to Jesus concerning Lazarus illness.
[time=1810] And during that message we discussed the fact that Jesus waited for two days before he responded to the crisis.
[time=1817] And he pronounced the fact that Lazarus was dead.
[time=1820] It was very difficult to understand that all of the people who were present in that situation had very much difficulty with his postponement of his response.
[time=1829] Then last week we opened up the second section which is verses 17 through 35.
[time=1836] And in the 35th verse we wrapped our thoughts around this great statement that Jesus wept and we saw in that statement which Jesus uttered when he stood outside
[time=1846] of the town of Bethany waiting to go to the grave.
[time=1849] We saw in that statement the humanity of Christ and the humility of Christ and the sympathy of Christ for those in need.
[time=1857] Now today finally we come to verse 36 and at last we're going to get poor Lazarus out of the grave.
[time=1864] Jesus according to the text comes now to the place where Lazarus is buried and he
[time=1870] is going to perform this the greatest of all of his miracles apart from his own physical resurrection.
[time=1877] It is important if we're going to understand what happens in this text that we look at the key verses in the eleventh chapter.
[time=1884] Those verses are verses 25 through 27.
[time=1888] Here in verses 25 through 27 we see the key which unlocks the meaning of this
[time=1894] whole chapter.
[time=1895] Jesus said unto Martha, I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=1900] He that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live.
[time=1904] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
[time=1908] Believe us thou this and she said unto him, yea Lord I believe that thou art the
[time=1914] Christ the Son of God who should come into the world.
[time=1918] Jesus said to Martha, I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=1923] Martha said I believe that you are the Christ.
[time=1926] Jesus now is going to demonstrate the reality of his claim and the validity of his claim by actually in the physical realm doing a miracle which demonstrates his power of resurrection.
[time=1939] And men and women just exactly as he is unique in his ability to remove blindness
[time=1945] from eyes he is unique in his ability to give life only God gives life.
[time=1951] There is no other agency in all of the universe that is able to impart life to that which is dead God does that and when Jesus claimed that he was able to do that he claimed to be God.
[time=1968] And the importance of this miracle is that it demonstrates beyond any shadow of doubt the deity of Jesus Christ through the miracle which he wrought.
[time=1978] Now as we examine this we need to keep in mind again that in this story we have the humanity and the deity ever interplaying one with the other.
[time=1988] A few moments ago Jesus stands outside of Bethany and he weeps for Lazarus.
[time=1993] That is his humanity.
[time=1995] Now he stands before the grave and he is going to resurrect Lazarus.
[time=1999] That is his deity.
[time=2001] They are not in conflict with one another.
[time=2003] They have blended beautifully together because he is both the Son of God and he is the Son of man united forever in a perfect person ever to be that way in the presence of God the Father.
[time=2014] When we unfold the miracle it is helpful to us if we can move through the passage and sort of outline it as we go.
[time=2021] First of all we come to the 36th and 37th verses and we see here the confusion of
[time=2027] the Jews, the confusion of the Jews.
[time=2032] When the Jews saw what was happening they did not understand.
[time=2036] In verse 36 they said behold how he loved him.
[time=2041] Then in the very next verse they tried to reason his love in light of his activity.
[time=2047] They say could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died.
[time=2054] The Jews remembered that Jesus had been the one who performed the miracle of taking the blindness away from that man who was born blind.
[time=2062] In fact if we had opportunity we could go back to the 9th chapter we would learn why they remembered it.
[time=2067] This man's testimony concerning Jesus was so potent that they threw him out of the synagogue.
[time=2073] The Jews never forgot what Jesus did when he took the blindness from that man.
[time=2077] And when they saw the love of Jesus in his tears and then they realized that he had delayed his coming until this man had died and now he was in the grave for four days.
[time=2087] They couldn't put it together.
[time=2089] How could Jesus really love this man enough to cry for him and yet at the same time when he had no need and a crisis he seemed not to care enough to come and meet that need.
[time=2099] It is interesting in verse 32 that the Jews were simply echoing the problem that Mary had.
[time=2105] For in verse 32 of chapter 11 Mary said when Jesus was come and she was come where he was and she saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him what?
[time=2115] Lord if thou hast been here.
[time=2118] Lord if you had just gotten here on time my brother had not died.
[time=2125] The Jews were so confused as they tried to figure out God's plan in the midst of this situation.
[time=2132] Their question was in essence how can love delay.
[time=2138] If God cares why does he make me wait for so long to see his power displayed in my behalf.
[time=2146] If God is really interested in me if he knows my need if he really does care about
[time=2152] me why do I have to wait so long for God to deal with my situation.
[time=2158] You ever feel like that?
[time=2160] Well the Jews certainly were confused.
[time=2163] They didn't understand.
[time=2165] I think it's quite interesting in the thirteenth chapter of John when we have the account of the Lord's washing the feet of the disciples.
[time=2172] Peter comes to the Lord and he says Lord does thou wash my feet and Jesus said what
[time=2178] I doest what I do thou knowest not but thou shalt know hereafter.
[time=2184] Jesus said Peter what I'm going to do you don't know.
[time=2188] I don't think he would ever be on our level to say it's none of your business.
[time=2193] But he said Peter what I'm going to do you don't know but you will know.
[time=2197] In my time according to my schedule one of the great fallacies of modern day Christians and I suppose it's been with us since the beginning is that we want to take God and his ability and put him into our time schedule and make him work according to our plan.
[time=2213] Some unknown poet has written these words if we could push a jar the gates of life and stand within and all God's working see we might interpret all this doubt and
[time=2224] strike and for each mystery find a key.
[time=2228] But not today then be content poor heart God's plans like Lily's pure and white unfold we must not tear the close shut leaves apart time will reveal the
[time=2239] calyx of the globe and if through patient toil we reach the land where tired feet
[time=2246] with sandals loosed may rest when we shall clearly know and understand I think that we shall say God new best the psalmist said in Psalm 37 rest in the Lord
[time=2259] wait patiently for him the Jews were unwilling to operate on the time
[time=2265] schedule of the almighty God they did not see in Jesus Christ one who had power over that situation and they were confused and we can well understand that for they had not accepted him as the Messiah they did not know much about his work but what we cannot understand is the second part of this drama where we see not only the Jews confusion but we see Martha's conclusion for in the next part of this we read Jesus said to Martha and to the disciples standing around into the Jews take away the stone and Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he's been dead for four days someone has written that Martha should have married Thomas and then they could have ruined one family all by themselves two doubters married together in one relationship Martha was certainly a doubter the Bible says that when Jesus came to the grave he was groaning within himself it's the same phrase that used in verse 33 Jesus groaned within himself that is a kind of a an idiom
[time=2329] that describes an inaudible noise an inaudible sound that comes from within a
[time=2335] human being at a time of great trouble and agony when Jesus stood before that
[time=2341] grave he groaned within himself and he said to those standing by move the stone
[time=2348] from the mouth of the grave now in the Jewish culture they buried their dead in a cave the tomb of Jesus was a cave I have been in Jerusalem and and seen
[time=2360] Gordon's Calvary in the tomb and it's just a cave carved out of a big hillside
[time=2366] the Jews would oftentimes carve out a cave or they would use a natural cave and sometimes put shelves in there and many times a whole family was buried in the same tomb out in front of the entrance to the cave they would chisel out a a trough or a groove in the ground and then they would find a round stone and on an incline they would put that stone until someone was buried then they would roll that stone down the incline in the groove until it closed off the mouth of the cave it was not for hermetic purposes but to keep the animals from getting into the cave and destroying the bodies now the Bible said that Jesus said to those standing around Lazarus grave take the stone away from the mouth of the cave and when he said that Martha blurted out Lord he's already dead and
[time=2413] he's been dead for four days and he's already started to decompose Lord he's already stinking and Lord if it's all right I'd like to remember him the way
[time=2424] he was you see Martha did not believe that Jesus was going to resurrect him
[time=2431] and you can study back through the passage and you'll discover that when Jesus asked her if she believed that he was a resurrection in the life and that Lazarus would come back from the grave what did she say she said yes Lord I believe he'll be raised in the last day she wasn't looking for any immediate miracle and when Jesus wanted the tomb open she could only assume that Christ wanted one last look at his good friend Lazarus and she wasn't she wasn't interested in having any part in that see Martha's problem was this here she
[time=2462] was standing in front of the grave and Christ was right beside her God in the flesh the wonder working powerful God but Martha didn't see Christ all she saw
[time=2474] was the corpse she had her mind so fixed on the problem that she could not see
[time=2480] the answer to the problem standing right next to her she was like many Christians I know who are so problem oriented they never look beyond the problem to see the answer to the problem in the person of Jesus Christ who never remember that the purpose of a problem is to demonstrate our own deficiency so that coming to the end of ourselves we might see in Christ his sufficiency and turn to him Martha did not understand that the purpose of Lazarus death was in order that there might be a resurrection all she saw was that corpse in her mind's eye and she didn't want to have any part because in her mind the conclusion was settled it was a problem nobody could do anything about it was done it was finished it was over and there was no use to disturb the corpse of her dead
[time=2527] brother the Jews had an idea that a that a corpse that a that a person died and his spirit hovered around him for four days and after the fourth day then the spirit left and in Martha's mind I mean not only was he dead he had started to decompose but his spirit was gone too so let's don't open this thing up again it's too late Martha said no way well in verse 40 we come to the correction of
[time=2555] Martha Jesus said to Martha in verse 40 said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God and as you study this reference you have a hard time finding where Jesus said that most scholars believe that that statement is a combination of verse 4 and verses 25 and 26
[time=2574] and that she had heard Jesus say that and the elements of that are in these verses Jesus said to Martha have I not said unto you that if you would believe
[time=2584] you would see the glory of God now listen carefully Jesus did not say if you
[time=2590] believe I'll do the miracle the resurrection of Lazarus would have happened
[time=2597] whether Martha believed or not and that's obvious in the text because Martha didn't believe she did not believe that Lazarus would come back from the grave Jesus said Martha if you believe you will not only see a resurrection you will
[time=2611] see the glory of God in the resurrection that's what Jesus Christ was talking about you see Martha had her mind fixed on the corpse and she was thinking of what was going to happen to Lazarus Jesus was interested in Martha seeing what he was and what he was going to do and what power was resident in his person Martha was fixed on Lazarus and his resurrection and and the potential that could be there Jesus didn't want her to see that at all he wanted Martha to see what he was demonstrating by way of his own power and in his own person now isn't it interesting that in this text we have an exact inversion of the modern day
[time=2650] counterpart of the modern day saying that is so often heard in our world today
[time=2656] what is the saying well seeing is believing have you ever heard that seeing is believing
[time=2662] what did Jesus say Jesus said that's all right for the human realm but in the spiritual realm believing is seeing have I not said unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should it see Jesus said if you believe you will see and that's the
[time=2677] way it is in the spiritual realm if we believe the word of God we end up seeing with the eyes of our faith the actual realities which we have trusted in Christ for and when Martha was corrected Jesus said to her Martha I told you before
[time=2692] that if you get your eyes off the corpse and onto the Christ you're going to see the glory of God in this situation you see folks we need to keep in mind that
[time=2702] the resurrection of Lazarus was really not very beneficial to Lazarus he had to die all over again some folks have said in that sense it really wasn't a true resurrection it was a resuscitation because true resurrection always means
[time=2718] absolute eternal life from that moment on Lazarus was resurrected he had to die again it wasn't for Lazarus that the miracle was done it wasn't for Martha and Mary to have their brother restored to them it was for the glory of God to be manifested and for Jesus Christ to demonstrate that what he said he was he was and Christ was correcting Martha by saying to her Martha get your eyes off of what I'm doing and get beyond that to the sign of what that means in terms of my own glory in relationship to God well then we come to the confidence in
[time=2754] the Father which is verses 41 and 42 now Jesus stands before the grave they have opened the grave up the stone has rolled away and the Bible says Jesus lifted his eyes up to heaven and he prayed it's a very interesting prayer it wasn't a thanksgiving it wasn't a petition but a thanksgiving Jesus didn't say oh God give me the power to raise Lazarus from the grave Jesus said Father I thank you that you've already heard me and I know that you always hurt hear me because I
[time=2783] am sent from you and you and I are in this together you are God and I am God and
[time=2789] we are together one in what we do the works that I work are the works of him
[time=2795] that sent me we are together we are one and father I thank you already that you've heard my prayer and that this prayer is going to be heard and answered and doing that Jesus gives us a beautiful picture of personal faith write these three things down number one his faith was personal wasn't in something it was in someone in the Father secondly his faith was perfect he thanked God
[time=2819] before the miracle happened he didn't wait until after it was done to thank him he thanked him in advance and thirdly his miracle was public he didn't pray in a corner he didn't go off someplace and bow his head but in front of all of these Jews in front of all of these people Jesus lifted up his face in his eyes to heaven and he thanked God for what was going to happen the confidence in the father now notice verse 43 the call of Lazarus we are now at the focal point of the story
[time=2846] the scene has been set the Jews are here the family of Lazarus is here the stone has been rolled away Jesus has prayed and now the moment has come and the Bible
[time=2857] says Jesus said Lazarus come forth and the phrase is not a verb and an adverb
[time=2865] it's two verbs it's like this Lazarus come hither in our vernacular I imagine
[time=2874] it would be like this Lazarus get out here and the Bible says that he shouted that in fact in the text of the book of John
[time=2886] it is intensive it says that Jesus cried with a loud voice and the word cried is
[time=2892] enough if that's what you want to say because that word means to cry with a loud voice but the text says Jesus cried with a loud voice with a loud voice as if to say that he shouted and a lot of folks wonder why he did that
[time=2907] somewhat well you want to be sure Lazarus heard him but folks Lazarus is dead remember and you can shout or you can whisper and it doesn't do the dead any good why did Jesus shout I think there are three reasons and I think they're exciting number one he shouted for the effect that it would have on the Jews in the day when
[time=2929] Jesus lived on this earth the wizards and the and the magicians were in plenty and they used to do their incantations in little mutterings a silent muttering sort of inaudible but almost audible Jesus wasn't like that when he was ready to do a work he shouted and he wanted that to make an intense effect upon the Jews he wanted them to see that what was going to happen was directly related to who he was and to his prayer and he wanted to tie all of that together so he did that for effect secondly he did it for the exclusion of the rest of the dead more than a few expositors have believed that if Jesus hadn't called Lazarus name loudly that Hades would have emptied all of itself out and graves would have popped open all over the world he called Lazarus by name so that all the rest of the dead wouldn't be resurrected at the same time too but thirdly and this is the most exciting thing he shouted as an example to the church
[time=2985] for in first Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 16 we read these words there is
[time=2991] coming a day we call it the day of the rapture when the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a what a shout and the dead in Christ
[time=3003] shall rise first someday the heavens will open and Christ will come and there will be a shout like the shout here that will open all of the graves and the dead in Christ shall be resurrected and I think Jesus must have had that in mind when he said to Lazarus Lazarus come forth well we come now to the to the awful tense moment
[time=3025] the crisis of the Christ verse 44 Jesus has said I am the resurrection in the life
[time=3032] now we're going to find out whether he really is or not isn't it interesting that the resurrections that Jesus performed progressively get more difficult when he raised Jairus daughter she'd been dead for a few minutes when he raised the widows son he'd been dead for a few hours when he raises Lazarus he's been dead for a few days and folks if Lazarus in a few minutes doesn't come walking
[time=3056] out of that tomb Jesus is through do you understand me if Lazarus doesn't walk
[time=3062] out of that hole in the in the rock in a few minutes as a response to the command
[time=3068] of Jesus Christ who has claimed that he has power over death the whole ministry of Jesus Christ and our our salvation in his death and resurrection all of that is forever finished because Christ has claimed to be something that he is not but the scriptures says and he that was dead came forth and you know when they
[time=3093] buried the Jews they didn't mummify them like the Egyptians I always had this picture in my mind even until I studied this again that there were two miracles involved here one when Lazarus was resurrected and the other when he got outside wrapped all up like he was trying to get out to the to the hole in in the rock but you see the Jews didn't wrap all around like this they wrapped all of the arms and the like that they wrapped the legs like that and then they put a sort of like a sweat band around the face and so when Jesus said Lazarus come forth out he came I imagine it must have been something like this and the Jews and all those who gathered you can just see their eyes like this never had they seen anything like that before and Jesus said to the crowd he
[time=3136] commanded the crowd and I believe it was the Jews he said to them loose him and
[time=3142] let him go and the Jew said you're not talking to me are you no way I'm not
[time=3150] going near that thing isn't it interesting that Jesus didn't say let's sit Lazarus down and ask him what it's like to come back from the dead did you see any bright lights did you feel your spirit hovering over you Lazarus he
[time=3165] didn't say any of that he just said let's get this guy back up on his feet and going and he said to the Jews you unwrap him and turn him loose now notice
[time=3174] this miracle is attested to by the three senses they smelled right and they saw
[time=3181] and now they're going to unwrap him and they're going to touch him Jesus didn't want this ever to be forgotten and then he said three things to them in one command that I find most interesting he said turn him loose and let him go unwrap him unbinding and let him go unwrap his arms so that he can work unwrap his
[time=3202] legs so that he can walk and unwrap his face so that he can talk Jesus wanted to
[time=3208] set Lazarus free so that he could work again for the Lord so that he could walk in fellowship with the Lord and so he could begin to witness for the Lord and I just want to stop here and say folks that in this whole matter of resurrection that belongs to God I can't do that there's nobody here that's ever been saved in the spiritual sense in the true in the true sense of the word you've never been born again because I did it I can't do it I have never saved anybody in my life God is the only one who can bring life to an individual but you know what I can do
[time=3240] I can roll away the stone and I can unwrap them and let him go and God has let me
[time=3247] have the privilege of rolling away some stones of ignorance and air and prejudice and problem and all of that and then after a person's gotten saved he's given me the opportunity to teach them how to walk and to work and to witness that's the
[time=3263] part I can do and God lets us be a part of his plan he does the work we can't do he sets us free to do the work we can do and so Lazarus was set free now what happened was Lazarus a mighty testimony
[time=3281] to the power of Christ look in your Bibles in the 12th chapter verses 10 and 11
[time=3288] but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death why because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus
[time=3299] in that neat I'll tell you what Lazarus must have been the most powerful testimony
[time=3305] and witness to the resurrection power of Christ that ever walked on the earth the people knew what had happened to him they knew what he was before and now
[time=3316] they saw what he was after and it's so revolutionized his sphere of influence
[time=3322] that everybody was coming to find out how Lazarus got to be the way he was and men and women that's exactly what God wants to do today he wants to take your life in the spiritual realm and bring you out of spiritual death and set you free from the bondage and sin of the old life and the old sin and open you up to work and to walk with the Lord and to witness for him with the direct result that wherever anybody sees you they're going to say hey what happened to him let's bow together in prayer you can know Christ is your savior today by asking Jesus Christ into your life
[time=3364] when Christ says to you come forth if you will answer by faith I will you can be freed from spiritual death and become a new born Christian
[time=3375] by the power which is in Christ Jesus Ephesians says you are dead in sin but Christ will quicken you if you'll trust him do it today while there's an opportunity while there's time trust in Jesus Christ is your savior and experience spiritual resurrection
