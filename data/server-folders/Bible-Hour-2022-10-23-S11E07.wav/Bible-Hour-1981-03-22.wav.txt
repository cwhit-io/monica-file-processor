[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] >>From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=42] we present the Bible hour with Pastor David Geremont.
[time=47] (music playing)
[time=66] >>Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=71] >>And we welcome all of you to our service today.
[time=74] This is the second service of the morning worship schedule of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=79] And this is friend day, and all of you who are here in the services know that it's friend day because you waited in line in the hallway to get in for a long time.
[time=88] And I appreciate your patience, and I thank you for being here, and all of you who are a guest today.
[time=94] We welcome you in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thank you for being here.
[time=99] We express our appreciation to all of you from our church family who have invited your friends to be with us today.
[time=105] And then we want to welcome all of those who have joined us now by way of television.
[time=109] And thank you for being a part of our special service this morning.
[time=113] And we consider you our friends, and so we just incorporate you into this special day as well.
[time=119] We're trusting that God will use this hour to bring blessing and encouragement into all of our lives and to study the Word of God together, and as we now begin to praise Him together through music.
[time=129] Please listen to the ministry of our choir as they share with us now.
[time=133] May God's richest blessing be yours as you worship with us during this hour.
[time=154] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=308] Thank you, choir, for leading us in our worship of the Lord
[time=315] and that majestic hymn and anthem.
[time=318] We're so happy to express our appreciation to the Lord for His gift to our Church of Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=326] They belong to our family as members of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=330] They represent us wherever they go in a certain sense and we pray for them and are always grateful when they're able to be with us on the Lord's day.
[time=338] And they're going to sing for us now.
[time=340] It's a song in the form of a prayer and I know that it will be a blessing to you, Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=346] [MUSIC]
[time=440] Lord, why do you have quietness?
[time=451] Till all our striving cease.
[time=458] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=539] â™ª
[time=546] We're so happy to have you with us today and we thank you for sharing the Bible our with us.
[time=550] This is a very special day in the ministry of our church.
[time=553] It's friend Sunday here.
[time=557] We have many visitors who've gathered with us for the very first time in our services on this Lord's day.
[time=561] One of the visitors is not my wife.
[time=563] She's with us every Sunday except for those times when the children are ill and she has to stay home and care for them.
[time=569] Donna, we have had some exciting things happen in recent days in terms of reaching out to a greater number of folks.
[time=575] And one of those things has to do with radio.
[time=578] I'm going to share with you some of the expansion plans of the Bible our ministry.
[time=583] If you have friends living in Fresno, California, you might share with them that they can listen to the Bible our on radio station K-I-R-V on Sunday mornings at 8 a.m.
[time=596] And it's going to take a little bit of an adjustment on our part to get used to saying listen instead of watch because we've always been on television.
[time=603] But now on radio in these great metropolitan areas with a tremendous opportunity to reach out with the gospel.
[time=609] Another area where we have just added a station is in Lyndon Washington and we will be heard on Sundays at 8 a.m. in Lyndon Washington.
[time=618] We'd encourage you to write your friends in that area and tell them to be sure and listen to the Bible our as it comes into that area by way of radio.
[time=625] And we have some things we want to share with those of you who are at home that will be of help to you as we extend the Bible our ministry to where you are.
[time=632] Not making it just a one hour experience on the Lord's Day, but something that happens every day of the week.
[time=638] It has always been our desire on the Bible our to put things into your hands that will be meaningful to you as you grow in your Christian life.
[time=647] And one of the tools that we are offering right now is the Gospel of John.
[time=651] It's a modern paraphrase of the Gospel of John.
[time=655] And it is underlined in various colors and green and in black for instance the black shading as you read through this little paraphrase has to do with the sufferings and death of Christ.
[time=667] It's really helpful as you're reading through when you come to a highlighted verse to know specifically what that's referring to.
[time=674] And we'd be happy to send you a free copy of this little booklet.
[time=677] All you need to do is call us at our toll free number one eight hundred four five three nine thousand.
[time=684] Ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would like to have your free copy of the Gospel of John.
[time=690] Donna, a number of folks have told me that they appreciate this little section of John's Gospel because they can stick it in their pocket or in their pocket book.
[time=697] Take it with them to work and on break or over the lunch hour have opportunity to read and study the Gospel of John.
[time=703] And of course it's very appropriate for us right now because we're studying the Gospel of John during this year of 1981 in the ministry of our church.
[time=711] We'd encourage you to write for this special edition. We'd be happy to send it to you as soon as we get your request.
[time=716] We just did a study on the number of folks who are using the daily walk through the Bible our ministry.
[time=723] It was overwhelming to me to know that five thousand copies of this are prepared each month and sent out all across the country especially here in the Midwestern part of our country.
[time=733] Men and women and young people and boys and girls even are studying the Word of God on a daily basis by reading through the Bible in the daily walk program.
[time=742] Now the genius of the daily walk is the fact that you can begin any time during the year and then just maintain your schedule and in a year's time you will have read through the entire Bible.
[time=752] What a tremendous accomplishment for you to pursue in your own Christian experience and the spiritual growth that is available to you through reading the Bible is something that you ought to strive for every day.
[time=764] We're happy to provide this opportunity for you. If you'd like more information about how you can enroll in the daily walk Bible study program simply call our toll free number one eight hundred four five three nine thousand.
[time=776] And when you call tell the operator you'd like to enroll in the daily walk we'll send you the first copy and information on how you can be enrolled and receive your monthly edition of the daily walk publication each and every month mailed right into your own home.
[time=790] We'd be happy to do that if we'll just give us an opportunity by calling or writing us this week. Once again the toll free number is one eight hundred four five three nine thousand and the address is Pastor David Jeremiah post office box fifteen thousand Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=806] We look forward to hearing from you this week. And we appreciate your support and your prayers as we continue to teach and preach the Word of God through the Bible our television and radio ministries.
[time=821] [MUSIC]
[time=835] Gentle Shepherds, come and lead us. What we need you to help us find our way.

[time=891] Who can help us face another day.
[time=902] Gentle Shepherds, come and lead us.
[time=914] All we need you to help us find our way.
[time=925] There's no other we can turn to.
[time=937] Who can help us face another day.
[time=948] Gentle Shepherds, come and lead us. All we need you to help us find our way.
[time=971] All we need you to help us find our way.
[time=986] [MUSIC]
[time=1006] All we need you to help us find our way.
[time=1073] [MUSIC]
[time=1083] All we need you to help us find our way.
[time=2039] Jehovah is salvation.
[time=2041] When the angels came to announce the birth of Jesus when He came into this world in Luke, they said, "And thou shalt call His name Jesus." Why?
[time=2052] For He shall save His people from their sins.
[time=2056] When you believe in the name of Jesus, you believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and you trust in Him alone for the salvation of your own soul and you accept Him as the final payment for your sin.
[time=2069] Now, John says that a man is condemned already because he has not believed that Jesus is the Son of God.
[time=2078] I have talked in 12 years of ministry in this city to hundreds of people about the Lord Jesus Christ and I have discovered a most interesting truth about this very aspect of being a Christian.
[time=2091] I do not usually find that when I talk to people about the gospel that they have any difficulty at all believing in the reality of God.
[time=2099] I ask them about their faith and usually they will say that they believe that God has created this vast universe.
[time=2105] He has put the planets in place and He has created the beauty of this earth, the seas and the firmament.
[time=2111] He has created individuals and animals and all of that.
[time=2113] They believe in the Creator, God the Creator.
[time=2116] And most of those same people believe that that same God is interested in them in some vague way, that He has a plan for their life and it is their desire to search out that plan.
[time=2127] And when I ask them about Jesus Christ, if they believe that He is the Son of God, most of them will say yes.
[time=2132] I believe that Christ is God's Son.
[time=2134] Sometimes they say they believe that He was a great teacher, a great example, that He came down here to show us how to live.
[time=2141] And all of those things are true.
[time=2143] Every single thing that I have said is absolutely true according to the Word of God.
[time=2147] But listen, men and women, you can believe all of those things and you can die in your sin.
[time=2152] You can believe that God is the Creator, that He has a plan for your life, that His Son, Jesus Christ, came down here and walked among men and was a great example.
[time=2160] The great divide among men and women today as it relates to Jesus Christ has to do with what John is talking about right here in this verse.
[time=2168] He is saying to us that you can believe about Jesus Christ, but if you do not believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior, that He came to die for your sin, and that He is your Savior, and your only hope of eternal life, the Bible says you are under condemnation because you have not believed in the name, the characteristic, the work, the quality of Jesus Christ, who is the only begotten Son of God.
[time=2190] Now the reason why a person who has failed to believe is under condemnation according to the Word of God is because he has not believed or he has refused to believe in Jesus Christ as his Savior.
[time=2200] Reason number one.
[time=2202] Two.
[time=2203] Notice what it says in verse 19.
[time=2205] And this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.
[time=2214] The second reason why men and women are condemned already who have not believed is because they refused to turn from their sinful life.
[time=2223] What does John say in verse 19?
[time=2225] He says the condemnation is this.
[time=2228] That light has come into the world.
[time=2230] And men loved darkness rather than light.
[time=2233] And why do they do that?
[time=2235] Because their deeds are evil.
[time=2238] When I first began to talk to people about Jesus Christ, one of my favorite pastimes, I came into this community out here in Fort Wayne where there are many professional people and I found immediately that when I would go to talk to someone about Christ or have lunch with a businessman, quite often I was in over my head because these men, many of them, were much greater intellectuals than I would ever hope to be.
[time=2263] They had a better grasp of the concept of logic than I would ever hope to have.
[time=2267] And when I would try to talk to them about Jesus Christ, quite often they would ultimately say to me at the end of the conversation, Pastor Jeremiah, I understand all that you're saying, but I need to tell you that I have some tremendous intellectual problems with what you're trying to help me understand.
[time=2283] And so I would come back to my office and get all my books out and I'd write a little essay on all their problems.
[time=2288] And I'd get prepared and I'd go back to visit them again.
[time=2291] I'd have all that problem figured out and I'd answer it the best I could from the Bible.
[time=2295] And when we got all done, having answered that problem, they had another intellectual problem.
[time=2301] And I went through that process for a while as a pastor until finally I began to realize something that nobody who had intellectual problems was really coming to grips with what it meant to know Christ as Savior.
[time=2312] And then I began to realize a most astounding fact.
[time=2316] That intellectual problems really did not keep people from the Savior, but that intellectual problems were a smokescreen behind which intellectual people hid because they did not want to know Christ, knowing that if they knew Him, He would change the way they live.
[time=2333] And that's what John is saying.
[time=2335] He is saying that men are condemned because light has come into the world and they love the darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.
[time=2346] Now, in the Bible, in the Gospel of John especially, you can see illustration after illustration of this truth.
[time=2353] When the Lord Jesus came into the world, He was immediately confronted with all the religious leaders.
[time=2358] And in the New Testament, the religious leaders were called Pharisees.
[time=2361] Now, a Pharisee was the goodest of the good.
[time=2364] He was the best of the best.
[time=2366] If you wanted to find a good person, you find a Pharisee because he had all the law and all of the sub laws and all of the laws under the sub laws and he had memorized them and he was living every day trying to keep all those laws.
[time=2376] If you were looking for a good person, you'd look for a Pharisee.
[time=2380] But when the Pharisees came into the presence of Jesus Christ, they got so angry that ultimately they were responsible for nailing Him to the cross.
[time=2390] And the reason for that was simple.
[time=2392] When a Pharisee came into the presence of Jesus Christ, he not only saw in Christ all of the outward goodness that he tried to embrace, but he saw in Christ all of the attitudinal goodness, all of the motivational goodness, all of the spiritual goodness.
[time=2407] He saw Christ doing not only the right thing, but in the right spirit and he was condemned because of what he saw in Christ.
[time=2413] And the only way he could deal with that was instead of dealing with his own life and his inadequacy, he began to get angry at the Lord Jesus and he hated the Lord Jesus and ultimately was responsible for nailing Him to the cross.
[time=2428] You see, when light comes, if we don't deal with the light as we ought to and respond to the light as we ought to, we have only one choice, and that is to curse the light and continue to walk in darkness.
[time=2443] Let me see if I can illustrate what I mean.
[time=2447] A man decides to take a friend of his to a great symphonic presentation.
[time=2452] The man himself is a great music lover and he loves the kind of music that is symphonic and classical.
[time=2460] And he brings his friend along to this great presentation and they're seated in the concert and he looks over at his friend and he notices that his friend is not really into it like he is.
[time=2470] He's fidgeting, he is looking at his watch, he's moving his feet on the floor and he's just squirming around in the chair.
[time=2479] He can't understand that.
[time=2481] And he'll be not enjoying this great symphonic presentation.
[time=2484] Why, when he listened to this symphonic presentation, he felt closer to God.
[time=2489] And here is his friend sitting there and he's not getting anything out of it at all.
[time=2492] And so they walk out of the building and on the way home.
[time=2496] The young man who was his guest says, "You know, I didn't think much of that orchestra.
[time=2501] I didn't like them.
[time=2503] I didn't think they were good at all.
[time=2506] It's the best orchestra in the country.
[time=2509] Is the orchestra condemned?" Oh, absolutely not.
[time=2513] The man is condemned.
[time=2514] What he has done is demonstrated his own musical ignorance.
[time=2518] He has pointed out for everyone around him that he has no heart or soul for music.
[time=2523] He is under condemnation in the presence of the greatness of this orchestra because he has no way of responding to it.
[time=2531] And instead of understanding that he needs a music appreciation course, he condemns the orchestra.
[time=2537] Or another illustration, a man goes to a great museum where on the walls of that museum hang all the masterpieces of the world.
[time=2546] And the attendant takes the visitor through the great museum and they go through as they leave.
[time=2553] And as they're finished, the guest says to the attendant, "You know, I didn't like all them pictures.
[time=2558] I didn't think much of them." And the attendant says to him, "Sir, it may surprise you to understand that these artists and these pictures are no longer on trial.
[time=2571] Only those who visit and see them are on trial."
[time=2577] And the man is condemned, not the pictures.
[time=2580] He is condemned.
[time=2581] He has condemned himself as a non-artistic person.
[time=2585] He does not understand how to appreciate art.
[time=2588] Now the Bible says that a man who lives in the presence of God's truth and has the opportunity to see God's truth and understand it when he rejects that truth and determines to walk in darkness that does not condemn the truth.
[time=2602] That is the condemnation of him.
[time=2604] He does not respond to the light and that puts him on the spot.
[time=2608] Sometimes when I talk to folks about Jesus Christ, they pass off my testimony like they say, "You know, I'm sorry, preacher, I just don't believe that." And you get the impression when they say it that they feel like by not believing it, they can make it untrue.
[time=2622] I don't believe it, so therefore it's not true.
[time=2624] But the Bible says you can believe it or not believe it, but it's true.
[time=2628] And the light has been given, and your response or lack of response to it is the motivation, the reason, the cause of your either being condemned or not condemned.
[time=2638] The Bible says that a man is condemned because he refuses to turn from his sin.
[time=2645] I am convinced that the greatest reason for people rejecting Christ is not intellectual, it's moral.
[time=2651] It is not that they don't understand, it's that they refuse to believe.
[time=2654] And they know that if they did believe, Jesus Christ would take control of their life and begin to put things in order.
[time=2659] And as a guy said to me one day when he walked into my office, he said, "I'm not about to become a Christian.
[time=2664] It would be mighty inconvenient for me if I were to do that right now." But you see, it's not only the distance between God and us,
[time=2673] and His holiness and our unholyness.
[time=2675] It's also the direction.
[time=2677] If it were possible, we still would be apart from God.
[time=2681] I have a little boy who's three years old who's just getting into sports.
[time=2684] Believe it or not, he can dribble a basketball, now and then.
[time=2688] And he likes to play baseball. He has his own rules.
[time=2692] It's very interesting. It's a great way to play, you're always a winner.
[time=2696] We throw the ball to him and he swings.
[time=2698] If he didn't come with him 10 feet of it, he runs the bases anyway.
[time=2701] It's a fun thing to do, and he makes up his own bases.
[time=2704] Wherever he feels like there ought to be a base, he just runs there, and he comes back and slides in home, and he's always safe.
[time=2710] You ought to try to play catch with him. That's most interesting.
[time=2714] He gets away from you, and pretty soon he says, "Daddy, you're too far away.
[time=2718] Come closer. You're too far, Daddy. Come closer." And so we get closer and closer and closer.
[time=2723] Finally, when you're just close enough, he could almost touch you.
[time=2726] He winds up and throws it as hard as he can.
[time=2729] But you don't have anything to worry about, because even though you're that close, and he's there, the ball goes over there.
[time=2736] You see, the problem with Daniel and his baseball ability isn't distance.
[time=2741] The problem is direction.
[time=2744] The problem with a person outside of Christ isn't that they can't get closer to God.
[time=2748] The problem is they don't even know how to aim.
[time=2750] They don't even know how to reach out to God.
[time=2752] And therefore, God is up here and they're here, and they're reaching out over here.
[time=2756] The religions of the world are an attempt on the part of an individual to somehow find God.
[time=2761] But the Bible says God has given us the light that we need to have in order to know God, and we reject that light, and we strike out in our own direction trying to find God somehow on our own.
[time=2771] And the Bible says that if that's the course we take, according to the Scripture, we are condemned already.
[time=2779] Now the third reason is also found right here in this text.
[time=2784] And this is the condemnation that light has come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
[time=2790] For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light.
[time=2793] Now I want you to notice in your Bibles, if you have your Bible open, that the word light is found here in these few verses five times.
[time=2800] Verse 19, and this is the condemnation, that light is coming to the world.
[time=2804] Men love darkness rather than light.
[time=2806] Verse 20, and everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light.
[time=2811] Verse 21, "But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light." What is light?
[time=2816] What does the Bible mean when it talks about light?
[time=2820] Well, the concept of light in John's gospel is a concept that teaches us that God helps us to understand about Himself through truth,
[time=2829] and truth is light.
[time=2831] Wherever we get truth from God, according to the Scripture, that is light.
[time=2836] And where does light come from in the world today? Well, the source of all true light concerning God is in the Bible.
[time=2842] God's holy book.
[time=2844] This is the book where God has revealed Himself to us, and when you are walking in this world trying to know God,
[time=2850] the only way you're going to get into light on your pathway is through this book.
[time=2854] Thy word is a light unto my path.
[time=2857] That's how we know God through the light.
[time=2859] Now, the light also comes through churches where the Bible is preached, and the light also comes through the verbal witness of Christian people
[time=2867] who have the word of God in their hearts and share that with others.
[time=2870] And the light also comes through the means of television and radio as the light is disseminated out over the airwaves
[time=2876] and goes into the darkness of a human heart.
[time=2879] And the light is also in Christian publications where the gospel is presented in books and articles, et cetera.
[time=2885] Now, the Bible says that a man is ultimately condemned before God because he rejects the light.
[time=2893] Now, let me ask you a question.
[time=2895] What is your attitude toward the light? That's a good barometer.
[time=2898] That will tell you exactly where you are, exactly where you are.
[time=2901] Do you like to go to church? Do you like to sin under the word of God?
[time=2905] Do you rejoice in the opportunity to be with other Christian people who want to talk about Jesus Christ and what He means to them and how they relate to Him?
[time=2913] When you go to a bookstore, do you look for a book that will have an uplifting influence in your life by which you can grow?
[time=2919] Now, the Bible says a man is condemned because he refuses the light.
[time=2924] I like to tell our people, it's like the guy who became so convicted from the articles in the newspaper
[time=2930] about the evils of smoking that after a long period of deliberation he gave up the newspaper.
[time=2937] Now, that's what God's talking about.
[time=2943] You know, we don't like the light if it runs cross-current to where we are, and so the attitude of most modern Americans is this.
[time=2951] I reject it. I don't want to be around it. Don't tell me about it. Don't talk to me about it.
[time=2956] Don't bring me under the presence of that stuff.
[time=2958] I reject the light, and the Bible says, folks, that a man is condemned because he refuses the light that God has given him.
[time=2966] You know, I think that's especially true for all of us in America.
[time=2970] If we lived in another country where light was not very great, maybe it wouldn't be such a great condemnation,
[time=2976] but I believe with all of my heart that any American who walks out of his life having lived it on this planet
[time=2982] and stands before God, having rejected Jesus Christ, has a greater condemnation than any.
[time=2987] For everywhere you turn in this great land of our, there are lighthouses here and there and everywhere.
[time=2994] There are dozens of places throughout this city where you can go and get the light from God's word and where you can learn what it means to be born again and become a Christian.
[time=3002] But over and over again, the people of our land just, I don't want it.
[time=3006] They push it away. They push it away. And this is what the Bible says.
[time=3010] Everyone that doeth evil hates the light.
[time=3014] Neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved.
[time=3019] But he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought of God.
[time=3025] It's a wonderful thing to watch the change that takes place in the life of an individual once they have believed on the name of the Son of God.
[time=3032] You can chart it and you can chart it in relationship to the light.
[time=3036] A person who is not a Christian will oftentimes struggle with their attendance at church, with being with other Christians, with having anybody talk about the Bible.
[time=3045] But let Christ come and take up residence in their life. Let them believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and it changes overnight.
[time=3051] We have a young man we've been praying for for a long time in this church.
[time=3055] And you all know who he is. And he came to Christ a couple of weeks ago.
[time=3058] And I was away preaching at a Bible conference and I called home and his mother happens to be a secretary in our church.
[time=3064] And she said the day after he came to receive Jesus Christ, he was after her trying to find a Bible.
[time=3070] He knew he had one somewhere. He didn't know for sure where it was.
[time=3073] And someone had bought one for him, brought it to him.
[time=3075] You know what? I couldn't have gotten a Bible in that boy's hands for the two years before he came to Christ if I'd have jammed it in his pocket.
[time=3083] What happened?
[time=3085] He believed on the name of the Son of God and his relationship to the light changed radically.
[time=3091] Now you see the barometer of your life is this.
[time=3094] It's not nice for me to say you're condemned. That's what God says.
[time=3097] But the barometer is you don't have to be.
[time=3099] If you want to know what God has to say to you and if you want to know what it means to be born again, all you have to do is do what God says.
[time=3106] And that's believe on the name of the Son of God and receive him as your Savior.
[time=3112] I remember reading just recently a story of a fellow by the name of David Hoyt who grew up in the generation when the hippie culture was at it Zenith out in San Francisco.
[time=3123] And David Hoyt was into the Eastern mystical religions.
[time=3127] And one day a fellow by the name of Kent Philpott who was a Baptist seminary student and had done some research in the mystery religions got ahold of him and asked him to come to a Bible study.
[time=3138] Interestingly enough the Bible study was held in the basement of the Krishna temple when the guru was out of town.
[time=3145] And they studied the Bible around the table, down the basement of that building.
[time=3149] And one day when the two men were there studying the scripture together, there was a fire and the temple caught on fire.
[time=3158] And those two men ran to the other room where there was an altar of the religions of the universe, the universal religious altar, and they tried to put the fire out.
[time=3166] And the only thing that young man could save out of all of that display of the world's religions was the copy of the Bible.
[time=3173] That's the only thing that didn't get caught up in the fire.
[time=3175] And he grabbed it and put it under his arm and he went home.
[time=3177] And he opened the scripture and began to read this passage of scripture we're studying today.
[time=3182] And he said it began to dawn on him immediately that the problem was he was seeking for light in the wrong place.
[time=3189] He wanted to know the truth.
[time=3191] He wanted to have light in his life, but he said as he sought for light in the mystery religions, he began to realize that there was a great internal darkness that filled his soul.
[time=3199] He saw all of the inconsistencies of what he was being taught in and it didn't work and it had no hope and there was no freedom and no joy.
[time=3206] And immediately as he began to read about Jesus Christ, he sought out his friend Kent and they bowed together and he received Christ as his Savior.
[time=3214] And he wrote and I quote, "I was set free from a spirit that had kept me from the truth
[time=3220] and I felt clean and whole for the very first time in my life."
[time=3226] Light always brings freedom and joy and it casts out the darkness.
[time=3234] And the Bible says that if you don't have Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are condemned already because you are rejecting the light that God has given to you.
[time=3243] Now today you've come to this service and I don't have any corner on the light.
[time=3247] All I do is open the book and expose it, but you've been exposed to some light.
[time=3252] And from this moment on, you're responsible for the light that you've seen and for the truth that you've heard.
[time=3257] And the question is what will you do with the light God has given you?
[time=3261] You have the choice.
[time=3262] It's your responsibility to make the decision.
[time=3265] D.L. Moody who captured the crowds in the great city of Chicago in the last part of the 1800s was preaching one time in his church and he was preaching from the book of Matthew in the last part of the book and he was preaching on this text, "What then shall we do with this Jesus of Nazareth?" When he came to the conclusion of his sermon, it was a series of messages he was giving over a period of time and he said to his congregation, "Now I want you to take this truth home and meditate on it over the week and then come back next Sabbath day and we will take the passage that comes after it and we will talk about Jesus Christ at the cross." And Moody said that as he was explaining that to his congregation, his song leader Iris Sankey began to lead to him and the hymn was, "Today the Savior calls for refuge fly.
[time=3316] The storm of justice falls and death is nigh." And he said even as the song was being sung, he heard the noise of the fire engines in the distance.
[time=3327] It was October 8th, 1871 and the great Chicago fire had just started and Moody's church was caught in that fire and it was decimated and burned to the ground.
[time=3340] Over 4,000 people died in that holocaust and Moody said that many of them who died that night never again had an opportunity to decide what they would do with this Jesus of Nazareth who was called the Christ.
[time=3357] And he said it changed his life.
[time=3359] He never again asked anybody to wait.
[time=3361] He always said, "It's now. It's now for you." And it's now for us.
[time=3368] We must decide what we will do with Christ, shall we pray.
[time=3372] Our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed and to those who watch at home I simply ask you to make your decision to trust in Christ as your Savior, receive him as your Lord, ask him to come into your life right now and forgive your sin and he will do it.
[time=3386] And as you pray believing, you can know the joy of what it means to be born anew and become a child of God, one of his own family.
[time=3395] And Father, we pray right now not only for those who have shared this service with us at home.
