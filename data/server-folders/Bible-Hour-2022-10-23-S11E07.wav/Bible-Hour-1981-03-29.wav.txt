[time=595] We'd be very happy to send you that listing if you'll just get in touch with us, and we'll give you the information you need in just a few moments.
[time=602] We're grateful for your continued support and prayer for the Bible hour ministry as we reach out across this country with the Word of God in this Bible teaching program.
[time=612] We are still receiving many requests each week for the little booklet, The Daily Walk, and this is a Bible study program, which if you would just read 20 minutes a day in God's Word and you continue that for one year, you would read completely through the entire scriptures in one year's time.
[time=629] They give you a portion of scripture to read, and then there's a little passage on insight into that passage that you have read for that day.
[time=637] And it's just a real encouragement to help you be regular in your time with the Lord.
[time=642] And we would like to send you a free copy of The Daily Walk. If you would like to have your free copy, just call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=654] Ask for the Bible hour operator and tell her that you would like to have your free copy of The Daily Walk.
[time=659] Donna, we have over 5,000 copies of The Daily Walk being published each month going out all over this country.
[time=666] Many of the people here in the Midwestern area and all over the United States with the Bible hour is seen by cable.
[time=672] And we're just excited about this Bible study program because we know it's ministering to the lives of people on a daily basis.
[time=678] We're also very excited about the special little offer that we're making available during this time period while we're preaching on the Gospel of John.
[time=686] It's a very interesting little version of the Gospel of John in a modern up-to-date language that will be very easy for you to read.
[time=695] And the thing that's exciting about this little section of the Scripture is, first of all, it's small enough to carry in your pocket or in your purse.
[time=702] And secondly, it's marked in a very special way to help you get the most meaning out of the text.
[time=708] There are markings that show the statements relating to the deity of Christ. There are markings that show the actual passages that deal with the suffering and the death of Christ.
[time=719] And this little companion that you want to take with you everywhere you go will help you to get the Word of God in your own heart.
[time=727] And to be thinking and memorizing and reading the Gospel of John in this special up-to-date version so that as we open the Scriptures each Lord's Day, the messages from the Gospel of John will be even more meaningful because you will have read the book and studied it and thought about it and have it in your own heart.
[time=745] This very special companion that we want to send to you for your own life spiritually, a small section of the Gospel of John is available simply by calling our toll-free number 1-800-45-39000 or writing to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=765] We'd like to hear from you this week and we'll be so very happy to send to you your free copy of the Gospel of John as soon as we hear from you.
[time=774] Either by phone or in the mail.
[time=777] And we have two associate sponsors today that we would like to share with you, Mr. Harold Draper from Reading Michigan and Mary H. Anderson from Kwanah, Indiana.
[time=788] And we say thank you to you folks for your part and having the Bible hour on the air today in your area.
[time=795] Donna, an associate sponsor, is a person who gives $100 toward the time of the air cost in their area.
[time=803] And we are grateful for these folks who have helped us make the Bible hour available on today's stations, wherever we are seen, but specifically on the stations where they watch the program.
[time=814] They have helped us make the program available today, and as we've joined hands with them, we feel a very special closeness to these people who have helped us get the word out on today's Bible hour.
[time=825] Now it's time to go back to our morning service, our special guest, Martin Thompson, and we have a message from the Word of God as we open the Gospel of John to the 6th chapter.
[time=835] We'll begin a new series of messages today on the 7 IMs of Christ. Today I'm speaking on the subject. I am the Bread of Life.
[time=843] I hope it will be helpful and encouraging to you. That is our prayer, and you'll be joining us. I'm sure as we open the Scriptures together in just a moment.
[time=865] If I could find the right words to say, to tell you just what Christ means to me.
[time=894] I'd say He's more than I can show, and more than you'll ever know.
[time=912] Christ means more to me than you'll ever know.
[time=922] Christ means more to me than I could possibly show.
[time=931] His love is more so mature. He's more than you'll ever know.
[time=950] If you could have seen me just yesterday, you'd know why He's life and breath to me.
[time=968] You'd know why He's more than I could show, and more than you'll ever know.
[time=986] Christ means more to me than you'll ever know.
[time=996] Christ means more to me than I could possibly show. His love is more so mature.
[time=1013] He's more than you'll ever know. His love is more, it is so much more.
[time=1032] He's more than you'll ever know. His love is more than you'll know.
[time=1055] Thank you, Maria. Isn't it true that no matter how we try to describe what Jesus Christ is to us,
[time=1061] He is all that we say, the sum of all of those things plus a lot more beside.
[time=1067] He's more than anything we can think or say to describe Him.
[time=1070] He is our God and our Savior, and that's why we love Him.
[time=1074] Just before the message, we're going to listen again to Martin Thompson as he sings for us right now.
[time=1088] Great is thy faithfulness. Oh God, my Father, there is no shadow of turning with thee.
[time=1105] Thou changes not thy confessions. They fear not as thou hast been thou forever.
[time=1122] There will be great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning, my morning, new mercies I see.
[time=1141] All I have needed thy hand hath provided. Great is thy faithfulness. Lord unto me, pardon for sin.
[time=1165] And a peace that endereth thy own depresence to cheer and to guide.
[time=1175] Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow. Blessings of mine with ten thousand beside.
[time=1193] Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning, my morning, new mercies I see.
[time=1208] All I have needed thy hand hath provided. Great is thy faithfulness. Lord unto me. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1230] Great is thy faithfulness. Morning, my morning, new mercies I see. All I have needed thy hand hath.
[time=1253] All I have needed thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1271] Lord unto me.
[time=1289] Thank you, Martin. Now let's open our Bibles together shall we to the sixth chapter of John's Gospel.
[time=1308] John chapter 6 and we're reading today from the sixth chapter of John's Gospel. Begin our reading at the 30th verse. John chapter 6 verses 30 to 40.
[time=1322] I'm going to ask that you just follow along in your Bibles as I read from mine today. John chapter 6 verses 30 to 40.
[time=1331] They said therefore unto him what signs show us thou, then, that we may see and believe thee. What does thou work?
[time=1340] Our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written. He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
[time=1346] Then Jesus said unto them, verily, verily I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven,
[time=1352] but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world.
[time=1360] Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life.
[time=1369] He that cometh to me shall never hunger. And he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
[time=1375] But I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.
[time=1383] And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
[time=1392] And this is the Father's will who hath sent me. That of all that he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again the last day.
[time=1401] And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone who seeeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
[time=1413] Shall we pray together? Our God in heaven, as we begin a new series of studies in this great gospel, the Gospel of John,
[time=1424] direct our thoughts by the Spirit of God and cause that our minds will capture the truth that is taught and disseminated this morning from this pulpit.
[time=1435] Allow the Spirit of God to take that which we learn, and Lord may we in faithfulness apply it to our own lives.
[time=1443] May we find in this message from the Word of God today help and encouragement and strength and direction for our lives, for we pray in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=1456] We begin today a series of messages on the seven I Am's of John's gospel. By that I mean the seven statements recorded in the fourth gospel of Jesus Christ saying that He was something. He said I am.
[time=1474] We begin today with the first which is His statement in verse 35 that He is the bread of life. Jesus said I am the bread of life. In chapter 8 verse 12 and chapter 9 verse 5 Jesus said I am the light of the world.
[time=1491] In chapter 10 verses 7 and again in verse 9 Jesus said I am the door. By me if any man enter in he shall go in and I and find pasture. In John chapter 10 verses 11 and 14 we have the fourth statement. Jesus said I am the good shepherd.
[time=1511] In John chapter 11 that great chapter of the resurrection of Lazarus Jesus said in verse 25 I am the resurrection and the life. In John chapter 14 in verse 6 a passage which we have memorized many of us Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comeeth unto the Father but by me.
[time=1535] In John chapter 15 in verse 1 Jesus said I am the true vine. These seven statements from the words and the lips of Jesus His claims about Himself will provide the series that we begin today.
[time=1553] And we begin our study with His first claim recorded here in the sixth chapter of John where He claimed to be the bread of life.
[time=1562] Now in order for us to understand this statement from the lips of Jesus we need to see it first of all in its wider context and then in the context of the events which are recorded right here in the sixth chapter.
[time=1575] When I speak of the wider context I speak of that which encompasses in essence the whole Bible for when Jesus said to the Jews of His day that He was the bread of life there would be certain things in their minds that they would remember first of all from the Old Testament and secondly from the oral teaching of the New Testament which was circulating during that time.
[time=1598] They may have gone back as far in their thinking to the third chapter of the book of Genesis where we are told that when Jesus sent Adam and Eve out of the garden he said to Adam that by the sweat of his brow he would eat bread.
[time=1612] The first mention of it in the scripture a reminder that even as early as that record the concept of bread being the staple sustenance of life was clearly entrenched in the minds of the Old Testament writers.
[time=1627] Later on in the book of Genesis in the 14th chapter in verse 18 we read of one Melchizedek who brought an offering of bread and wine.
[time=1636] Later in the book of Genesis we read of the unleavened bread or of Joseph's bread in the 41st chapter in the time of famine in the land of Egypt when Joseph dispensed the bread of his day.
[time=1648] In the book of Exodus chapter 12 we are told about the unleavened bread of the Passover feast and in the 16th chapter we read the story of a manna in the wilderness when God fed the Jews in that 40 year period of time with a special heavenly bread.
[time=1664] In the 40th chapter of the book of Exodus we are told that when the Lord set up the tabernacle he put in the tabernacle what was called the table of show bread and once again it finds its way into the economy of the Jews.
[time=1677] When we cross over the line into the New Testament we are scarcely started in the life of Christ before we read of his temptation in the wilderness and Satan said unto Christ take these stones and make them into bread.
[time=1690] And Jesus said unto Satan don't you know that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
[time=1699] Now when Jesus said to the Jews I am the bread of life many of these thoughts were circulating in their mind and we know that because in his inner change with the Jews they refer at least to the Old Testament story of the manna in the wilderness.
[time=1714] That's what they thought of when Jesus made that claim and that's what was going on in the wider context.
[time=1721] Now in the narrow context of this chapter there are other things that had happened that prepared the way for this claim of Christ to be the bread of life.
[time=1730] Think back with me through some of the things we have studied.
[time=1733] In the first few verses of John 6 we have the record of the feeding of the 5,000 which if you remember is better known as the feeding of the 15,000 because at least that many people were fed that day.
[time=1745] In those first 15 verses we are told that Jesus took the loaves and the fishes and he multiplied them so that they fed everyone who had come to hear him and to be fed by him.
[time=1757] In the 14th verse and the 15th verse we read that when the Jews were filled with the bread which Jesus provided they got so excited about him and they were so thrilled with what he was able to do for them physically that they decided they would take and make him king immediately.
[time=1773] They would thrust him into a place of leadership and in the background of our minds we think about the disciples getting excited about this too.
[time=1781] One of them would have been the Prime Minister, the other would have been the Secretary of State, they had it all figured out.
[time=1786] Jesus was going to take everything in control and he was going to fix all the problems the Jews had.
[time=1791] He would free them from Roman domination and so in verse 15 we are told that they would make him king and Jesus didn't want to be their earthly king and so the scripture says he went to a mountain to pray.
[time=1801] And he dispatched his disciples across the Sea of Galilee to Capernaum and it was during that journey that we have the events of the second part of chapter 6 out in the middle of the Sea of Galilee while the disciples are in the boat in the midst of the storm.
[time=1815] Jesus comes down from the mountain, enters the boat and the scripture says immediately they were at the shore of Capernaum.
[time=1822] Now the context of today's story begins in Capernaum but you need to understand what has happened.
[time=1829] He has multiplied the loaves and fishes, he has worked the miracle on the sea, now he is in Capernaum and verse 59 tells us he is in the synagogue in Capernaum and all of these people who had watched this wonderful miracle recorded in the first part of the chapter are so enamored what Jesus has done that they follow him and the scripture says they get into boats and they go to Capernaum
[time=1851] and some of them go around the edge to Capernaum and they follow Jesus because of what he had done and they are now going to be taught by Jesus the significance of that which has happened already in this chapter.
[time=1865] Here the discourse on the bread of life begins. Now let me stop for just a moment and share with you that what's going to happen in this story is not just another tale for us to tell but it is a most serious event in the life of Christ.
[time=1880] It is one of the most serious things that has happened up to this point in our study of his life and it is the beginning of the open hostility and opposition to Jesus Christ which ultimately caused him to be nailed to the cross.
[time=1893] There are at least three evidences of that in this sixth chapter. Notice verse 41 the Jews murmured at him because he said I am the bread that came down from heaven.
[time=1904] Notice verse 52 the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat.
[time=1913] Notice verses 60 and 61 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this what his claim to be the bread of life when they heard this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it.
[time=1927] And notice in verse 66 this unbelievable statement that from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
[time=1939] When Jesus said that he was the bread of life the result was that the Jews got all upset and they murmured against Jesus and they got into arguments with themselves.
[time=1949] But the astounding thing was that so serious was this claim from Jesus lips that from the time he made that claim many of his disciples no longer walked with him and he went on alone.
[time=1961] Now we have to ask the question what is there in what Jesus said when he claimed to be the bread of life that would cause such a strong reaction on the part of the Jews and even on the part of his own disciples.
[time=1974] And I think it becomes clear to us as we study this passage of scripture that the thing that caused the reaction wasn't that Jesus was claiming to be the bread of life but that behind that claim to be the bread of life Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah of God.
[time=1989] The God sent down from heaven the Christ he was saying to those at that time that he was God in the flesh he was accepting for himself and for all men that he was deity and he was saying to them in clear terms.
[time=2004] When you look at me you're looking at God I am God that's what Jesus was saying and if you know the story of the crucifixion you know that it was his claim to be equal with God that caused him to be nailed to the cross.
[time=2018] So this is a very serious event.
[time=2021] Now notice the relationship between the miracle and the discourse.
[time=2025] Is it not interesting that in this sixth chapter we have 14 verses that record the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 and verses 22 through verse 70 record the discourse or the events which transpired because of that.
[time=2040] I find that interesting because in our world today we seem to have reversed it we have turned it upside down.
[time=2047] We are 70 verses interested in the miracles and 14 verses interested in the words.
[time=2053] We are not interested in what Jesus has to say we want to see what Jesus can do.
[time=2058] We're not concerned about the words of God we are enamored with the works of God but Jesus puts that into perspective.
[time=2066] He says the only reason that I work these works is in order that I might open the door of your mind to receive the truth that I want to drop into that opening which has been created by the miracle.
[time=2078] The only purpose of the miracles of Jesus was in order that he might teach us a truth related to that miracle.
[time=2085] He did not go around dispensing his power willy nilly just blowing his power away on everything that he saw his miracles were always for the purpose of teaching us something about himself that we need to know.
[time=2098] And that's what he's doing in this passage of scripture.
[time=2101] He takes the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 and he uses that as the introduction to this great discourse where he claims to be the bread of life himself.
[time=2111] Now when the people found Jesus in the synagogue in Capernaum they tried to take advantage of him again and we get a clue to this in the fourth chapter of John beginning at the 26th verse.
[time=2123] I mean in the sixth chapter I'm sorry beginning in the 26th verse.
[time=2127] Jesus said to them when they came to him in the synagogue, verily, verily I say unto you, you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled.
[time=2140] Labor not for the food which perisheth but for that which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed.
[time=2151] What is Jesus saying? He sees right through them. He looks right into their heart of hearts and he says you're not here because of the real meaning of Christ the Messiah.
[time=2162] The only reason you've come over here to this synagogue and followed me across the Sea of Galilee and around the edge of the land to sit here in the synagogue when I teach the only reason you're here is because you've got your bellies full.
[time=2173] That's the only reason I fed you and your concept of life is if you feed me I'll follow you and that's the way they operated but Jesus looked right through that and he said you're making one great big mistake.
[time=2185] You are all intent and laboring on the food that perisheth and I want to talk to you about a food that will never perish and then he begins this discourse and he begins to challenge them concerning himself.
[time=2200] Now I want us to notice in verses 30 to 35 that there are two questions that the Jews raised and Jesus answers them in the way of explaining who he is.
[time=2211] Notice the first one in verse 30. When they got into the synagogue and Jesus was standing in front of them in Compertium they said unto him what signs show us thou that we may see and believe thee what does thou work.
[time=2226] Now that's an astounding thing to me because these folks who are asking that question are the people who had been on the hillside when Jesus multiplied the loaves and the fishes.
[time=2235] And in our mind's eye we can't help but ask the question good night what do you want?
[time=2240] What do you want me to do to demonstrate who I am? I just took this little lad's lunch and I multiplied it so it fed 15,000 people out here and you're asking me for a sign.
[time=2251] But notice what they're saying. In the next verse they're comparing what Jesus did to Moses in the Old Testament and they're saying Lord I know you think that what you did was great but let us tell you about Moses.
[time=2264] He did what you did 40 years long every day day after day after day the man who came down and fed the children of Israel in the wilderness.
[time=2272] Now Lord what are you going to do to top that? That's what they were asking.
[time=2277] And Jesus took their question and he answered it almost so quickly that you can't find it in the text.
[time=2285] He just passed over it but he nailed them to the wall with that question.
[time=2289] In the first place he said Moses didn't do that miracle. Who did it? God did. Notice.
[time=2296] Jesus sent it to them verily verily. I say unto you verse 32 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
[time=2305] And then he said secondly you don't even understand that what happened back there in Israel wasn't the true bread. That was just physical bread but my father in heaven he gives you the true bread and if you take the bread that he gives you'll have life ever more.
[time=2319] And then they came with their second request in verse 34 and they said unto the Lord Lord ever more give us this bread.
[time=2328] Now notice Jesus said when you got the bread in the Old Testament from Moses it came from God and it was bread that perished.
[time=2334] It only lasted one day and if you know the story it's a very interesting story.
[time=2338] If they didn't eat the bread on the day that it was given it rotted. It was only good for one day.
[time=2343] And he's going on to say later on that when they ate that physical bread it was great but when they went to their grave it didn't do them any good.
[time=2351] Now Jesus is saying to them I have a new concept for you. I have a bread that came down from heaven and if you eat of this bread you'll never die.
[time=2360] And the Jews said wow I never heard of anything like that. Where do I sign up? How do I get on the bread list?
[time=2367] They said Lord ever more give us this bread. In other words and that's a linear kind of word it says Lord every day we'd like to get in on that if we could.
[time=2375] Could you show us where to sign up for the welfare program that you're going to start Lord? Where do we get on the list?
[time=2382] And Jesus said okay if you want to get on the list here's how you do it. Verse 35 I am the bread of life.
[time=2393] If you take this bread you never hunger and you never thirst.
[time=2398] Well let me just say to you the best I know how in the lingo of today that blew their minds.
[time=2406] They didn't know what to do with that. You're the bread of life? How could that be?
[time=2415] And so he unfolds in these next few verses what he means by the truth of his being the bread of life.
[time=2424] I want us to think about three things that he meant when he said I am the bread of life.
[time=2429] Number one he meant to tell those Jews and tell us to that he was the source of life.
[time=2438] Notice in verses 32 and 33 Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven
[time=2446] but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven
[time=2452] and what does it say and giveth life unto the world. Jesus said I am the bread from heaven and what I want you to understand by that is this.
[time=2462] I am the source of life just as the nutrients and the minerals and the vitamins in physical bread cause life to happen in the life of the one who takes it into their being.
[time=2474] I am the bread come down from heaven and I am the source of spiritual life.
[time=2479] What I am said Jesus when I am the bread of life is this I am the source the beginning of life for you.
[time=2486] If you have me you have life and over and over again he substantiates this claim in this book.
[time=2495] I wish we could look at all the passages even in the immediate context where Jesus claims to have come down from heaven.
[time=2502] You'll notice it in verse 33 he said I am he who cometh down from heaven in verse 38 he said I came down from heaven not to do my own will.
[time=2510] And when he claimed that he had come from the father he had been sent from God.
[time=2517] What the Jews heard was this this man is claiming to be the Messiah of God.
[time=2524] He is claiming to be that special one of whom the Old Testament prophets speak.
[time=2528] This Jesus who says he came down from God is claiming to be the one about whom we have read and whom we have been told to believe in in the days coming.
[time=2537] He is claiming to be the Messiah.
[time=2541] Now all of the evidence was there.
[time=2544] Everything that the Old Testament prophesied about the Messiah had been fulfilled in the minutest detail in Jesus Christ.
[time=2551] And yet the Scripture said verse 36 but I said unto you that you have also seen me and what ye believe not.
[time=2564] The reason why they were so frustrated with Christ's claim to be the bread of life was because he claimed to be the Messiah and he was the Messiah but they didn't believe it.
[time=2574] They chose not to believe it.
[time=2576] They determined in their own hearts as we studied last week that they would not believe and so they did not understand.
[time=2583] Jesus said I am the source of life they said I don't believe that.
[time=2587] And so the anger began to well up within them against this one who had claimed to be God's special spiritual bread.
[time=2597] He claimed to be the source of life but secondly he claimed to be the sustaining of life or the support of life.
[time=2604] Notice in verses 48 to 51 these words Jesus again in verse 48 said I am that bread of life.
[time=2613] Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and here he is referring back to the illustration they had used earlier.
[time=2621] And he makes a very good point.
[time=2623] He is saying your fathers ate that bread back in the wilderness that's true but where are they now?
[time=2628] They are dead.
[time=2629] Obviously that bread wasn't for life everlasting.
[time=2632] That didn't last beyond the forty years of wandering in the wilderness.
[time=2636] They ate the man in the Old Testament and they died.
[time=2640] But he said this is the bread that cometh down from heaven that a man may eat of it and what does the scripture say and if he eats of it he shall never die.
[time=2652] I am the living bread that came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.
[time=2663] The manna of the Old Testament men and women was great it was meaningful it was helpful for the time.
[time=2670] It was physical bread for a physical need but the need ended when they died.
[time=2677] Jesus is not talking about physical bread he is talking about spiritual bread and he says there are three things that will happen if you take that spiritual bread.
[time=2685] Number one you will never hunger you will never thirst and you will never die.
[time=2689] That's what he promises.
[time=2693] May I say to you that people are dying today for want of that bread?
[time=2697] All over our country all over the world people are hurrying and scurrying trying to find the meaning to life when Jesus Christ has provided himself as the bread of life.
[time=2707] I was reading this week in the Old Testament prophets and in the prophecy of Amos chapter 8 verses 11 and 12 there is a prophecy which in my estimation seems to be played out in our world today.
[time=2720] Amos prophesied a day coming and this is what he said behold the days come saith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land.
[time=2730] Not a famine of bread nor of water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north to the south.
[time=2744] They shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and they shall not find it.
[time=2749] Jesus said there's coming a day in the future through the prophet Amos when men will starve for the hearing of the word of God and it won't be physical starvation it will be spiritual starvation.
[time=2761] There won't be a physical famine there will be a spiritual famine the word of God the bread from heaven won't be available and they'll run everywhere to and fro from the north to the south and the east to the west trying to find the bread and it won't be there.
[time=2777] And you say how is that being played out in our world today well if you take a journey across this great land of ours and you visit the great centers of civilization in our country and go into the great cities and try to find in those great cities churches that uplift this book and the Lord Jesus Christ about
[time=2797] whom it speaks if you turn on your television and try to find programs that teach and preach the word of God that are unencumbered by all of the other foolishness that usually is involved with that.
[time=2809] We're just the unadulterated word of God is preached and taught you will discover that if we aren't in the famine days we are we are quickly approaching them.
[time=2818] For along with all of the wonderful things that are happening in Christian America today to find the word of God preached and taught in churches of our land is becoming more and more difficult.
[time=2831] And by the way that's the reason why churches that preach the word of God grow because there are hungry hearts waiting for someone to open the book and dispense the message of the bread of life.
[time=2844] Jesus said that this bread of life is that which sustains and gives life and means in our own lives the joy of real living that's what Paul meant when he said for to me to live is Christ.
[time=2861] What did he mean? He meant that Jesus Christ is the bread of my life and for me to live is Christ he's everything in my life he is the sustenance of my life.
[time=2870] That's what he meant in Galatians 2 and he said I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not not I but Christ liveth in me.
[time=2879] Paul said my life is wrapped up in the truth of Jesus Christ he is my everything he is the satisfaction of my need the sustenance of my life.
[time=2888] And when Jesus said I am the bread of life what he was claiming to be was the support for the life of everyone who received him now thirdly he claimed to be the satisfaction of life.
[time=2898] Not just the source and the support but the satisfaction notice thirdly verse 35 he says I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he the believeth on me shall never thirst.
[time=2916] Isn't that interesting Jesus said if you eat of me spiritually now if you receive me your hunger is gone and your thirst is quenched and I have watched that over and over again.
[time=2930] I have seen people come into this church and sit into the Word of God and I've watched them as they've tried to find meaning in life and every avenue first over here and then over here and out there trying to find something that makes life worth living.
[time=2942] And all of a sudden they come to understand what it means to know Christ in a personal way they receive Christ into their life and the search is over.
[time=2949] They have found what they've been looking for in that endless search for meaning in life they have found in Jesus Christ the reality that causes the hunger to stop and the thirst to be quenched because he has promised that he is the satisfaction of life.
[time=2966] I was thinking this week about the prodigal son that wonderful story recorded in the 15th chapter of the book of Luke.
[time=2973] He provides a wonderful illustration about what I'm saying at this point.
[time=2978] Do you remember the story of his walking into the farmhouse and saying to his father I've had it I'm leaving.
[time=2986] I don't want any more of this stuff that we've got going on around here and I can imagine all that that must have been in today's vernacular.
[time=2993] He said I'm going I don't like what's going on here I'm restless I've got to go find my own way and his father may have said to him son what are you looking for.
[time=3001] He said I'm going to a place where I can get some clothes and get some good shoes on my feet and I'm going to eat and drink and be merry and I'm on a party.
[time=3007] That's what I want to do I want to go out and live the good life and live it up and have a fling.
[time=3012] And so he went down to the far country and when we first see him he is living in a riotous style.
[time=3018] He's doing all the things that are going on in the far country but it isn't very long before we get another glimpse at him and when we see him the next time we see him in the pig pin.
[time=3028] And he is slopping the hogs and he's eating the food that was given to the pigs the old husks that were left over.
[time=3036] And all of a sudden the Bible says he came to himself and he realized that this was a bad mistake that he had taken the wrong turn.
[time=3045] And that as the scripture says even the servants in his father's house were doing better than he was down here in the far country so he said to himself I will arise and go to my father.
[time=3056] And then we see that wonderful scene as he comes back to the old homes dead and his father comes running to meet him and embraces him.
[time=3062] Now notice what happened when he got home was this.
[time=3065] His father put a robe on his back and put shoes on his feet and killed the fatted calf and gave him food to eat and had a big old party for him.
[time=3075] Now listen everything that the prodigal son was hoping to find down in the far country was already in the father's house.
[time=3083] Isn't that true?
[time=3085] He went to the far country to get clothes when he got home the father put a robe on him.
[time=3093] He went to the far country to eat drink and be married when he got home the father killed the fatted calf and served it to him.
[time=3099] He went to the far country to party and when he got home the father threw the biggest party he'd ever had in his life.
[time=3105] You see what the world looks for and what the individuals in the world look for out there.
[time=3110] What they try to find in the bread of the world is nothing more nor less than the cheap junk food the world has to offer in place of the bread of life which is Jesus Christ himself.
[time=3122] And if they would just come to Christ who is the bread of life they would discover that everything they're looking for out there is already in the father's house.
[time=3130] Isn't that true?
[time=3132] [AMEN] And that's why Jesus said if you eat of me if you receive me you'll never hunger you won't have to do that anymore.
[time=3140] You'll never thirst but you'll find in me the total satisfaction of your life.
[time=3147] Now the question comes how do we take Jesus Christ as the bread of life how do we get him?
[time=3156] How do we if I can use the term that he uses later how do we eat the bread of life?
[time=3162] Well notice in your Bibles that verse 28 gives us one of the alternatives.
[time=3169] When Jesus expressed himself to the Jews they came up with a modern idea of what you do they said in verse 28 then said they unto him.
[time=3178] Now notice what shall we do that we might work the works of God.
[time=3184] Isn't that what everybody you know if I'm going to have this bread of life where do I sign up what do I have to do?
[time=3190] Give me the 10 things I must do before I get this satisfaction you were talking about.
[time=3194] If I can just do something pastor show me what to do I'm willing to do anything come to church okay if it comes to that I'll do it.
[time=3201] Get involved in service okay I'll do that just show me what must I do to do the works of God.
[time=3209] And what did Jesus say to them notice?
[time=3211] Jesus answered verse 29 and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent.
[time=3220] Well that's not a work you're exactly right because it is not by works of righteousness which we have done.
[time=3227] We are not saved by works lest any man should boast.
[time=3231] The only work quote unquote that we do is to believe on him that God has sent.
[time=3238] Now how do we believe?
[time=3241] Well notice verse 35 Jesus uses two words to describe what we must do.
[time=3247] And Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me there's the first one shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
[time=3256] What do you do to get the bread from God which is Jesus Christ the first thing you do is you believe on him.
[time=3262] Notice you don't believe in him you believe on him.
[time=3266] Many people today believe in him the devil believes in him and he trembles but when you believe on him you place all of your trust on him alone for eternal life.
[time=3276] You come to the place in your life when you say Lord Jesus you are the bread from God you are sent down from the Father to bring life everlasting.
[time=3283] You went to the cross to die for me I know that you died for me I believe on you absolutely and totally and alone for eternal life I believe on you.
[time=3294] And then secondly you come to him the scripture says if you believe on him then you come to him.
[time=3301] I believe in my heart that he is the Christ from God and I believe that with all of my heart and then I come to him and I say Lord Jesus I believe that and I trust you completely for life everlasting.
[time=3316] And then in verse 51 he uses that phrase which is so misunderstood in today's world he's not talking here about cannibalism or transubstantiation he's simply using an illustration from the physical to teach a truth from the spiritual.
[time=3329] He says in verse 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and that bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world.
[time=3339] What is he saying? He's saying just like you take physical bread and you break it up and you put it in your mouth and you eat it and you take it into your system physically.
[time=3348] So as the bread of life spiritually you must receive me into yourself spiritually you must invite me to come in you take me into your life and I become a part of you just as the food is broken down and becomes a part of your physical system Jesus Christ becomes a totality part of your life.
[time=3364] And so the Bible says if you want to know Christ you believe and you come and you receive and you can do it right now wherever you are in this auditorium wherever you watch you can believe on the bread from heaven shall we pray.
[time=3387] Our Father God we thank you for the privilege that we have of knowing that you have made provision for our lives in a world when the social gospel when liberalism preaches the needs for the here and now.
