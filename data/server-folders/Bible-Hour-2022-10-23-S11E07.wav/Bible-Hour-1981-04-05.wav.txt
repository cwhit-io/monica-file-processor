[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the
[time=29] Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=32] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geremy.
[time=36] Oh my Savior, God please, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord, I'll sing my soul, my Savior God please, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=66] And we welcome you to this service, thank you for being here, our prayer for you today is that God will use this hour to bring encouragement and instruction to your life.
[time=88] We pray especially for those of you who have joined us now by way of television, that during this time God will encourage and strengthen and bless your life through the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=100] You see now all throughout the Midwestern part of our country and as many of you know is heard on radio in a fast growing network of stations across the United States.
[time=112] The reason the Bible Hour is what it is is because it focuses its attention upon the Word of God and that's what we shall do in a few moments.
[time=120] But we worship the Lord our God through music and we invite your attention to the ministry of our choir as they remind us of a wonderful truth that we serve a living Savior he is alive today.
[time=142] Early was the Mormon to the tomb that gained the faithful.
[time=154] Surprise were they to see the stone rolled away.
[time=164] As they looked inside they saw an angel in the white glow.
[time=172] We said it's the Lord he told them that days.
[time=182] He is not here, he is risen.
[time=190] Just by the crown he would not obey.
[time=200] He is an empire and glory.
[time=208] He is alive today.
[time=218] Praising them all was lost to those who knew and loved him.
[time=232] He appeared to them and was found away.
[time=240] Bearing all the marks of death but still they saw him living.
[time=250] And we know that he is still living today.
[time=258] He is not here, he is risen.
[time=268] Just by the crown he would not obey.
[time=278] He is an empire and glory.
[time=286] He is alive today.
[time=326] The dynamic of the Christian faith is not explained in any other terms
[time=336] but that Jesus Christ is indeed living.
[time=340] Unlike any of the other religions of the world we serve a living Savior.
[time=344] There is no place where you can go to examine the remains of Jesus Christ in a tomb.
[time=350] Before he is not in the tomb he is alive.
[time=354] As we approach the Easter season what a thrilling thing to be able to share that message and that story.
[time=360] We are glad to have Janet Kruger back after a brief convalescence following the birth of their little daughter.
[time=370] And we have missed her ministry of music with her husband Don but she and Don are going to sing for us now.
[time=376] And I think if we behave ourselves they may even let us participate along the way.
[time=380] They are singing a song about a word that praises God.
[time=384] It is the word hallelujah. Don and Janet Kruger.
[time=390] When the Savior greets a ransom in his home beyond the sky
[time=412] and the reign of heavenly spender has begun.
[time=422] When the thousands, tens of thousands, blend their voices in his place.
[time=432] It will be the sweetest hallelujah, every song, hallelujah.
[time=446] Oh, hallelujah, lift the heavenly song by ransom tone.
[time=462] When we do ones there shall sing, hallelujah to their food.
[time=472] It will be the sweetest hallelujah, every song, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=490] Sing with us, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=518] Hallelujah.
[time=524] There is joy up in hand when a wandering child comes home
[time=534] and by angels' hands you denizens chimes are round.
[time=544] When the Savior of earth are welcome and you need a round his home
[time=554] it will be the sweetest hallelujah, every song, hallelujah.
[time=568] Oh, hallelujah, lift the heavenly song by ransom tone.
[time=584] When we do ones there shall sing, hallelujah to their king.
[time=594] It will be the sweetest hallelujah, every song.
[time=614] We are very grateful to have you with us today as we share together the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=618] Don and I counted a privilege to visit with you in your home.
[time=622] We consider it to be a very personal time that we share with each and every one of you.
[time=626] And we thank you for allowing us this opportunity to talk with you about the ministry of the Bible Hour,
[time=632] how it touches your life and what God is doing through this ministry as it continues to grow up across the country.
[time=638] Donna, there's a new tool that God is using for the Bible Hour and it's spreading of the gospel and I know you have some things you want to share about that.
[time=646] The newest outreach ministry of the Bible Hour is by means of radio.
[time=650] And we're really excited as we've been getting response in now almost daily from people who have never been exposed to the Bible Hour before and now are listening to it on the radio.
[time=660] And we would like to share with you each week a couple of stations that are carrying the Bible Hour so that if you live in that area or if you have friends or loved ones who live there, you can share with them that they can now listen to the Bible Hour on the radio.
[time=672] And two of the stations which we would like to share with you today.
[time=676] One is in St. Louis, Missouri on KSTL at 690 on the dial and that is on at 2.30pm on Sundays in the afternoon.
[time=686] And Seattle, Washington on KGN at 630 on the dial and that is also on Sundays at 2.30pm in the afternoon.
[time=696] And Donna, there are many other stations which carry the Bible Hour on radio.
[time=700] We'd be happy to send you a complete listing of all of the radio stations that are now carrying the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=706] If you will just write us and let us know, we'll be happy to send that to you by return mail.
[time=710] During this season of the year, all of us who are Christians are very sensitive to the truth of our Lord's suffering, his death and his resurrection.
[time=720] And of course the record of his suffering, his death and his resurrection is found in the four gospels of the New Testament.
[time=726] And the Gospel of John, almost one half of it, is devoted to the last week in the life of our Lord.
[time=734] It catalogues his suffering, his death, his resurrection and all of the events that surround that most important week in the history of our world.
[time=744] We have been preaching on the Gospel of John and we want to send you, as our free gift this month, a very special edition of the Gospel of John in a new and modern version.
[time=754] And this little Gospel of John section is a very helpful tool as you read about the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=762] One of the things that I think is very exciting about it, especially at this time of the year, is the fact that every passage in this Gospel that deals with the suffering of Christ is underlined in black so that it stands out from the text.
[time=776] And as you read through the Gospel, you are overwhelmed with the number of verses that deal with the prediction of his suffering, with the actual suffering itself, and then with the results of that as they accrue to us in the Christian family.
[time=790] We'd like to send you this very special edition of John's Gospel as our free gift to you this month, and we'll do it if you will just call or write us and let us know that you would like to have your copy.
[time=802] If you were to call us, you would pick up the telephone number that we're going to flash on the screen right now.
[time=808] It is an absolutely toll-free number, and it's 1-800-453-9000, and you can call that number from any place in the United States without charge.
[time=818] The operator will take your name and address, and will send this booklet to you as soon as we get your phone call.
[time=824] Of course, you can also write to us, and we'll give you that address in just a few moments.
[time=828] While you're calling and writing, you may also want to request a special Bible study tool that we've developed, and Donna wants to share that with you.
[time=838] It has always been our goal in the Bible hour to encourage folks to get into the Word of God for themselves and to see what it says firsthand.
[time=846] An excellent means of doing that is through the Daily Walk, which is a daily Bible study program, and if you just spend 20 minutes a day for a year, going through this program, you will have read through the entire scriptures in one year's time.
[time=860] Beginning in the May issue, you would start in Ezra, and you read through Ezra and Job, and it also has a brief portion in there explaining what you have just read.
[time=870] It's really a helpful tool, and we would like to send you a free copy of the Daily Walk, and all you need to do is call us again at our toll-free number, 1-800-45-39000.
[time=882] And our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=890] We do hope that you'll call or write to us today and ask for these two booklets.
[time=896] Donna, we have two couples that we want to honor today who are associate sponsors for the Bible hour, and we thank them so very much for their help and support.
[time=904] They're Mr. and Mrs. Maynard Devaux here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who are associate sponsors for the telecast that is being seen on WPT-A TV.
[time=912] And Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Hout, Fort Wayne, Indiana, who are also helping with today's telecast here in our home-based market, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=920] Thank you so very much for your help, and for your continued support of us as we carry on this work and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ through means of the Bible hour.
[time=930] Now we're going back to our morning service, and in just a few moments we're going to be looking at the 12th chapter of John's Gospel, a very special and important message that I hope you won't miss.
[time=950] [MUSIC - 214 seconds]
[time=1186] Thank you, Starr. That was Starr Narwald in a beautiful song that reminds us of a lesson we never really learned finally.
[time=1200] We just keep right on learning it all of our lives. We're happy that in our service today we have the symphony band and vocal ensemble from the Southfield Christian High School in Southfield, Michigan.
[time=1212] This 70-member group is touring seven of the Christian colleges in the Midwestern area and they have been ministering to our young people in the Sunday school hour, and they're all up there in the balcony.
[time=1224] Would you stand up young people so that we could see you? And let's welcome them to the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you very much.
[time=1230] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1238] And they have the wonderful privilege in the years ahead, many of them, of sitting under the ministry of a dear friend of mine, Pastor Joe Stole, who just became the pastor of the Highland Park Baptist Church there, and that school is associated with Highland Park Church and Pastor Stole is their new preacher.
[time=1254] And I recommend his ministry highly. He's a real good teacher of the Word of God and a man of God along with it.
[time=1262] Let's take our Bibles and turn to John chapter 12, John chapter 12.
[time=1268] We are interrupting our series of messages today because of an important matter that we must discuss.
[time=1276] John chapter 12 is our text and I'm reading verses 1 through 9. John 12, 1 through 9.
[time=1284] You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1288] Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
[time=1296] There they made him a supper and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
[time=1304] Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spike nerd, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair.
[time=1310] And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
[time=1314] Then, sayeth one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who should betray him, why was not this ointment sold for 300 denerai and given to the poor?
[time=1324] Then, or this he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief.
[time=1328] And he had the bag and he bore what was put in it.
[time=1332] Then said Jesus, let her alone, for the day of my burial has she kept this.
[time=1336] For the poor always you have with you, but me you have not always.
[time=1340] Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there.
[time=1344] They came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
[time=1352] Shall we pray?
[time=1354] Father, we pray that you will open our hearts to thy word and to the message of this hour,
[time=1360] and the importance of the subject with which we deal.
[time=1364] We ask O God that you will help us to be responsive to what the Spirit of God will say to us
[time=1370] during this time together.
[time=1372] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1376] Suppose you were to go to work this week, and on Tuesday your employer were to call you into his office
[time=1384] and sit you down and say, "Mr. Jones, I'm sorry to have to inform you
[time=1390] that during the next 30-day period we will not be able to pay you for 10 days work."
[time=1396] Now we expect you to be here and to punch the clock and to do your normal chores,
[time=1402] but unfortunately because of financial pressure we will not be able to remunerate you for 10 days of work.
[time=1410] Mr. Jones walks out of the office as that truth absorbs into his system and he goes home.
[time=1418] He sits down in his living room to figure out what to do.
[time=1422] He calls the bank on the phone and he says, "Mr. Banker, I have just been informed that
[time=1428] I will not be paid for 10 days work.
[time=1430] Therefore I would appreciate it because you are a kind and considerate man if you would discount this month's house payment by 10 days worth."
[time=1442] And I cannot tell you what the banker says.
[time=1444] He puts the phone down and he calls the utilities one by one and explains to them his plight
[time=1450] and says, "I'm sorry, but this month I will not be able to pay my utilities as I normally do.
[time=1454] I have taken 10 days of the month and discounted my payments accordingly."
[time=1460] You say, "Pastor, that's absurd." He could not do that. That would not be allowed.
[time=1466] Then he gathers his family around the table and he says to them, "Children, I don't know when it will happen,
[time=1472] but sometime within the next 30 to 45 days we will have 10 foodless days.
[time=1476] I just want you to know that so that you can begin to prepare, perhaps to cut back slowly
[time=1482] so that the pangs of hunger won't be so great when they finally come."
[time=1488] You say, "Did that really happen?" No, it didn't happen to a fictitious individual and his family.
[time=1498] It happened to a real family.
[time=1502] It happened to this family.
[time=1504] For this family is 10 days behind in its giving, 10 days for the year.
[time=1512] That doesn't sound like very much, but it is a lot.
[time=1516] In fact, it is $23,000.
[time=1520] And if this congregation continues to give at its present rate, by the end of 1981,
[time=1528] we will have fallen below our budget by $92,000.
[time=1534] Now we, like the fictitious man, have some decisions to make.
[time=1538] We must sit down with the family.
[time=1542] We already know that we cannot call the bank and ask for 10 days discount.
[time=1546] We have no opportunity to discount our utilities.
[time=1550] We cannot deal with any of the fixed expenses that are absolutely the same, month in and month out, no matter what comes into the treasury.
[time=1558] We have two alternatives.
[time=1560] Number one, we can take those things which are not absolutely necessary
[time=1566] to the survival of a ministry and begin to chop them off.
[time=1570] Things which we do not absolutely have to do in order to exist.
[time=1574] And we can pair the ministry down to that which is necessary for its absolute survival.
[time=1580] That's one choice, or we can try some way to recover the money that has been lost
[time=1586] from January 1 until this date.
[time=1590] We have chosen the latter.
[time=1592] We do not believe that there is anything in the ministry of this church
[time=1598] which is incidental to its ongoing influence in the community.
[time=1602] Through the budget process of the year, we go through this over and over and over again
[time=1608] with the sharp pencil and we cut out everything that is not absolutely necessary.
[time=1612] We are careful about expenses.
[time=1614] We go through this every month with the staff and with the deacons to make sure that we operate within the limitations which the budget imposes upon us.
[time=1622] But we cannot operate at a $23,000 deficit three months into the calendar year
[time=1628] without making some serious decisions.
[time=1632] I believe that this family is more than capable of subscribing the budget that we have voted upon to support.
[time=1640] And therefore, it is our purpose that on Easter Sunday, just two weeks from now in this local area,
[time=1646] we are going to take a special offering to try to recover what we have lost.
[time=1652] I don't know what to call that offering.
[time=1654] I've thought that perhaps it should be called a resurrection offering because it's obvious that there are a whole lot of people who need to be resurrected.
[time=1660] But we have chosen instead to call it the Easter recovery offering and we have set a goal of $50,000 for that Sunday's offering.
[time=1668] You say, "Pastor, $50,000?" I thought you said the deficit was $23.
[time=1674] Well, that's true.
[time=1676] But Easter is another week and the budget for this church is $17,000 a week
[time=1682] for the operating costs of its ministry.
[time=1684] And if we add the $23 that we have already lost, that's $40 and we still have two weeks to work on our deficit, and more than likely, we will make some more progress in that direction.
[time=1694] And then there is always a valley that comes after a special offering.
[time=1698] If we do not have an offering of at least $50,000, we will only postpone our problem for a couple of weeks,
[time=1706] and then we will have to discuss it again.
[time=1708] When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, he said to them, "I want you to give regularly and systematically so that there be no gatherings when I come." What he was saying was, deal with this thing as it ought to be dealt with, and we won't have to deal with it in a special way.
[time=1724] And that is my heart.
[time=1726] We have already taken two services from this church to try to deal with this problem, and it is my purpose as your leader to explain to you the necessity of our meeting that goal
[time=1736] on Easter Sunday so that the ministry can go forward without it being hurt
[time=1742] by serious cutbacks in staff and ministry.
[time=1748] Now, if we are to meet the $50,000 goal men and women, there is only one way that it will humanly be possible.
[time=1754] It will be necessary for between 20 and 25 of the businessmen of this congregation
[time=1760] to give at least $1,000 to that offering.
[time=1764] Because if all of us double-tived, in other words, if we were to give at the budget level, and all of us give twice what we normally give, we still are $16,000 below the goal.
[time=1772] The only way we can ever make this goal is for individuals within the congregation
[time=1778] to whom God has entrusted a greater measure of stewardship to come to me and say, "Pastor, you can count on me to be one of the 20 or 25 men who will give at least $1,000 to this offering.
[time=1790] One man has already promised to give too." That is an absolute necessity if the ministry here is not going to slow down
[time=1798] to a crawl during these next days.
[time=1800] And I am convinced in my own heart that we are more than capable of meeting that challenge with the resources God has entrusted to this congregation.
[time=1808] If the businessmen who are capable of helping will do their part, and then if all of us will sacrificially plan for that offering, we can get caught up and get well and move into these next crucial weeks
[time=1820] without having to take time to deal with a special problem.
[time=1824] As I thought about this, and what I might say to you from the Word of God today, I realize that there are many options open to me as a pastor.
[time=1832] I could spend the whole hour talking to you about our financial needs.
[time=1836] I've said all I'm going to say about that.
[time=1838] You know the problem, I don't have to spend the hour explaining it to you.
[time=1842] Or I could spend the rest of the hour scolding you for not doing what you should do, but that includes everyone and some who are giving over and above their ability, graciously and lovingly and sacrificially to the Lord.
[time=1852] And that is not my purpose.
[time=1854] It seems to me that what we need to ask God to do in our lives is to cause us in a new and different way to fall in love with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1862] For when we love Him, we will give to Him as we ought.
[time=1866] And when my thoughts turn in that direction, I open my Bible to the 12th chapter of the Gospel of John.
[time=1872] For in my opinion, John chapter 12 is the greatest exhibition of sacrificial love for the Savior found any place in the Bible.
[time=1880] It is an event that is recorded as having taken place in the last week
[time=1886] of our Lord's life on this earth.
[time=1888] During the last week before His crucifixion, these events took place.
[time=1892] This event in the day of Jesus is truly seen in the context which we have read.
[time=1898] You will remember that just a few days ago we studied the resurrection of Lazarus in John chapter 11, a glorious and exciting event.
[time=1906] And I told you when we studied that event that that was the end of our Lord's public ministry
[time=1912] and now He was moving to a quiet and a private ministry with His own.
[time=1918] John chapter 12 is the beginning of that private ministry.
[time=1922] He has come back to Bethany where Lazarus was resurrected and He has gathered there in the home of Simon the leper and present in that home for that time are Mary and Martha and Lazarus
[time=1934] and others of the Friends of Jesus.
[time=1936] This is going to be a party, a celebration with the Lord for what has happened.
[time=1940] Lazarus who was dead is alive and all of his family have gathered to give a tribute to the Lord and to pay homage to what he has done for them.
[time=1948] And so they're gathered there in that home and in that place.
[time=1952] And the Bible tells us that Mary, the sister of Lazarus,
[time=1958] when the party was gathered and they were seated at the supper table, Mary goes into another part of the home and she comes out into the dining area and in her hands is an alabaster box filled with spike nerd, a very costly ointment.
[time=1972] And she rushes to Jesus Christ, her Savior and her Lord.
[time=1976] And she opens that alabaster box and the Scripture says she pours the contents over the body of Jesus.
[time=1982] Here in this text we are told that she poured it over his feet.
[time=1986] But in Matthew and Mark we're told that she poured it on his head.
[time=1990] She lavished him with her love.
[time=1992] And that outpouring of love to Jesus Christ according to this text
[time=1998] is one of the greatest offerings that was ever given to the Lord.
[time=2002] I want us to examine some of the aspects of her giving.
[time=2006] Because it seems to me that they hold for us the great challenge that is ours.
[time=2012] When a need is announced and when an opportunity is given to get involved with the Lord in terms of our own financial stewardship.
[time=2018] The first thing that you notice about her gift is that it was sacrificial.
[time=2022] The Bible says that the contents of that alabaster box was worth 300 denarii.
[time=2030] When Judas saw this he responded why wasn't this sold and given to the poor for it would have been worth 300 denarii.
[time=2038] Why if you would go to the gospels you would discover that in one of the parables recorded in Matthew chapter 20 a denarii was equal to one day's work in the life of a New Testament laborer.
[time=2050] So if you compute that and understand that a Jewish calendar was a 300 day calendar you realize that what Mary gave to Jesus when she poured this spike nerd over his body was worth an entire year's salary.
[time=2064] She had taken that which had cost her an entire year of her life and in a moment of unbridled love and the explosion of a heart that loved the Savior she just took it and she just poured it all over him
[time=2078] because she loved him so much.
[time=2080] It was a sacrificial gift.
[time=2082] As I examine my own heart and as I consider the heart of this congregation
[time=2088] I sometimes feel embarrassed to talk about sacrifice.
[time=2092] For what you and I consider to be sacrifice is usually more of an inconvenience.
[time=2098] Sacrifice is what we do not know very much about.
[time=2102] To think for a moment of taking a whole year's salary and giving it to God.
[time=2106] I doubt if there are very many of us who have ever even contemplated the absurdity of such a thing in the way that we look at that which God has entrusted to us and yet Mary did that.
[time=2114] She reminds us of an Old Testament statement concerning David.
[time=2118] David who said, "I will not give to my God that which cost me nothing."
[time=2124] And he poured out a sacrificial gift to his Lord.
[time=2128] Mary knew the importance of sacrificial giving.
[time=2132] It is interesting to me that in this context we have three key people involved.
[time=2138] We have Martha who is known as the server.
[time=2142] She is known for her work for the Lord.
[time=2146] We have Lazarus and you remember when we studied Lazarus when the Bible says that they were told to loose him and let him go that that illustrated the fact that he was to walk into witness for his Lord.
[time=2156] We have Lazarus who epitomizes walking with the Lord and witnessing for the Lord.
[time=2160] And then we have Mary who's great claim to fame in this gospel narrative
[time=2166] was that she worshipped the Lord with her giving.
[time=2170] Now get this, Martha is dispatched in chapter 12 with two words.
[time=2178] Lazarus is cared for in 12 words, but there are 35 words devoted to Mary,
[time=2186] 35 words that are given to what she did in this particular context.
[time=2192] And it seems to me that there we have some of the balance of the Christian life.
[time=2196] We are also prone to be involved in working.
[time=2200] We are also prone to get involved in walking and witnessing, but Jesus wants our worship and he wants it to be sacrificial.
[time=2206] Something that costs us something that we give back to him and Mary exhibits that spirit in her own heart.
[time=2214] In the first service this morning when I challenged the men of this congregation to give a thousand dollars as a businessman to the offering on Easter Sunday.
[time=2224] At the end of the service, a young man gave me this note.
[time=2228] He said, "Dear Pastor, I lost $8,000 in 1979.
[time=2232] I lost $5,000 in 1980.
[time=2236] I need $72,000 by the end of 1981, which I have no idea from where it will come.
[time=2244] But I believe God's work must go forward and I will give $1,000 on Easter Sunday."
[time=2250] That's what we're talking about.
[time=2252] We give because it's easy, but to give because it is sacrificial,
[time=2258] and to give even when it hurts to give.
[time=2260] But Mary's giving also demonstrates another aspect of giving.
[time=2266] She gave as a service to God, not just as a sacrifice, but as a service.
[time=2272] Now the Scripture says that others before Mary had come to the Lord's feet, but they always wanted something.
[time=2276] We've been studying in the Gospels that every time Jesus did a miracle, there ain't multitudes came to Him because they wanted to get something from Him.
[time=2284] But when Mary came to Jesus' feet, she wanted nothing.
[time=2286] She only wanted to give of herself to Him in service.
[time=2290] The Bible tells us that the Lord loves a cheerful giver and that we ought not to give because we feel coerced to do so.
[time=2296] We ought to give because we want to serve God and we want to use the life that He has given to us
[time=2302] to give back to Him a gift of love and adoration for all that He has meant to us in the days of our lives.
[time=2310] And the Bible teaches us that Mary gave submissively.
[time=2314] She lavished her gift upon the Savior, pouring it at His feet.
[time=2318] She didn't do it with calculation.
[time=2324] She had not thought about how much she would give.
[time=2326] She brought all that she had.
[time=2328] And saving it for a long time, in fact, that gift had survived the death and burial of her own brother.
[time=2334] She hadn't even given that to Lazarus.
[time=2336] She had saved that back and having it now in her treasury, she brings it out and because of her love for the Lord Jesus who had raised her brother from the dead, she just threw it all on Him without even thinking about the cost because she loved Him so much.
[time=2352] Mary's example of devotion and giving is one that we should follow.
[time=2358] She gave her best.
[time=2360] She gave lavishly.
[time=2362] She gave even in spite of criticism.
[time=2364] She gave lovingly.
[time=2366] She gave to the Lord.
[time=2366] Then notice, she gave scripturally.
[time=2368] You know that the greatest thing I can ever do for the people in this church is not to get up and go after them for not giving,
[time=2374] but to get up and talk to them from the Word of God and give them what God says about stewardship.
[time=2380] And the Bible is filled with truth about stewardship.
[time=2382] In the Gospels, one out of every six verses has something to do with stewardship.
[time=2388] 16 of the 39 parables of our Lord deals with the subject of money.
[time=2392] There is no determination on the part of the Word of God to avoid an uncomfortable issue in most churches.
[time=2398] God says something to us about our stewardship.
[time=2402] And my job as a pastor is to simply open the Word and declare what God has said.
[time=2408] Now the reason Mary gave to the Lord Jesus is because she believed the Word of God.
[time=2412] Over and over again, Jesus had been teaching His disciples and Mary included that He was going to the cross and He was going to die and He was going to be buried.
[time=2422] The disciples didn't believe that.
[time=2424] There was no evidence in all of the Scripture that the disciples believed what Jesus was saying to them about His death, burial and resurrection.
[time=2430] They misunderstood it all, but Mary believed.
[time=2434] And the Bible says that Mary came to give this gift to Jesus because she believed what Jesus had told her about His death and burial.
[time=2442] And Jesus said that she gave this gift as an opportunity to anoint Him for His burial.
[time=2448] She gave based upon what the Scripture or what the Word of God had communicated to her about her responsibility.
[time=2456] Men and women, what I say to you about giving is meaningless.
[time=2466] But if I did, the only thing that would happen would be you would respond to a motivation that came from your preacher.
[time=2472] But I have the book, the Word of God, and God teaches us to give.
[time=2478] And when we respond to what the book says, we get what the book promises.
[time=2482] Give and it shall be given unto you, and the Bible tells us that God does not give with measure, he gives without measure.
[time=2488] Mary gave scripturally.
[time=2492] And then I want you to notice that Mary also gave seriously.
[time=2498] What do I mean by that?
[time=2500] Well, she gave while there was a chance.
[time=2502] Notice what Jesus said when Judas brought up his objection to what had happened and what he had witnessed.
[time=2508] Jesus said to Judas in verse 7, "Let her alone.
[time=2512] For the day of my burial she hath kept this, for the poor always you have with you, but me you have not always."
[time=2520] Now what did he mean?
[time=2522] Well, there's a good illustration right here in the Gospels.
[time=2524] Mary took that which she had saved back for the burial of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2530] And when the opportunity presented itself, she came and she gave while she could give.
[time=2536] In the book of Luke in the 23rd chapter, there is a record of some other women who wanted to give to Jesus and listen to that record from Luke 23.
[time=2544] And the women also who came with him from Galilee followed after and beheld the sepulcher and how his body was laid.
[time=2552] And they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.
[time=2560] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came onto the sepulcher bringing the spices they had prepared and certain others with them.
[time=2570] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2576] Now when we read that text on Easter Sunday, we are so excited about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we missed the disappointment of these women.
[time=2586] They had gone and prepared spices and ointments that they desired to give to the Lord Jesus.
[time=2590] And when they came to the grave where he was laid and they went in to present those spices to his body, the scripture says the stone was rolled away and Jesus was gone.
[time=2600] And they never got the opportunity to do what they wanted to do because they waited too long.
[time=2608] I'm always talking to businessmen who tell me that they're amassing their fortunes so that when they get to a certain level or maybe in their will, they can do something for God.
[time=2622] Only eternity will demonstrate how the work of God has failed because men have been deceived into thinking that they'll be able to give more out there than they can give now,
[time=2634] that they can give something after they die, that they aren't going to be able to give while they're alive.
[time=2638] There's a little limerick that reminds us that if we're given while we're living, friend we're knowing where it's going.
[time=2646] And that's true.
[time=2648] A lot of times when people wait until they die, they think their money's going someplace and it goes someplace else.
[time=2656] It's tragic to watch businessmen and young couples and families who are in the primary years of their ability to give to God post pong the opportunity to give until it is too late.
[time=2668] Their income goes down and they have no way to give because they're waiting for some time in the future.
[time=2672] And like these women who came to the grave, they wait until the opportunity is lost.
[time=2678] And then they miss out on the joy of that which Mary found to be hers when she took the opportunity that was presented and gave to her Lord when she had the chance.
[time=2688] Every Sunday we have the chance to do with our money what God has instructed us to do.
[time=2694] If we postpone it, if we wait to some other time, there will come a day when in our heart there is a desire to give, but in our resources there is no ability.
[time=2706] She demonstrated the attitude of seriousness which gave when the opportunity was presented.
[time=2716] Now Mary is presented against the backdrop of Judas.
[time=2720] And I'd like to suggest to you though it may not be popular that everyone who is listening to this message this morning is either at the Judas end of the spectrum or at the Mary end of the spectrum.
[time=2728] Some of you are clear over here with Mary and some of you are in the camp with Judas and all of us are on a continuum between the two.
[time=2736] Mary was selfless. Judas was selfish.
[time=2740] And everyone who was involved in the economy of God is someplace between those two extremes.
[time=2746] Now what was Judas response to Mary's gift?
[time=2748] Well Judas said one of his disciples, "Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denerai given to the poor?"
[time=2758] I remember when we were building one of our buildings there was a man in this church who came to one of our new believers after we had taken an offering for the building and said to that new believer, you know I think it's terrible that we're using all that money for a building.
[time=2770] We should have given that money to the poor.
[time=2774] And I wished I'd had enough sense back then to remind him yes there was one other person who said that.
[time=2780] His name was Judas Iscariot.
[time=2786] And the Bible explains and I think this is normally true when you get that pious diatribe from some well-meaning Christian that Judas wasn't interested in the poor notice.
[time=2796] This he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief.
[time=2802] And he was the treasure of the group and his eyes got wide when he saw a whole year's worth of labor three hundred denerai being invested in the treasury and that's what he took care of.
[time=2816] And he thought wow if they put that in there then I would get my grubby hands on it.
[time=2822] The Phillips translation reads this way.
[time=2830] He said this not because he cared for the poor but because he was dishonest.
[time=2836] And when he was in charge of the purse he used to help himself of the contents.
[time=2842] Judas was a dishonest steward.
[time=2844] He wasn't dealing factually with what was going on.
[time=2846] Here was a woman who lavished herself upon the Lord and all Judas saw was I could get a hold of that and use it for myself.
[time=2854] And isn't that the choice we all make when it comes to stewardship?
[time=2858] Either give it to God for his honor and glory or hang on to it so we can use it for ourselves and for some gold that we have in our own lives.
[time=2866] Judas was dishonest.
[time=2870] When the Bible says that Judas bore the bag.
[time=2874] What it really means is he bore it away.
[time=2878] He took it away. He used it for himself.
[time=2884] And isn't it interesting that this Judas ended up selling Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
[time=2894] And you know that 30 pieces of silver that he sold Jesus for in the betrayal was exactly one half of what Mary gave to Jesus on the day when she lavished her love upon him.
[time=2904] Now folks, Mary and Judas both became famous for their attitudes and their actions.
[time=2912] Did you know that?
[time=2914] The Bible says in Matthew chapter 26 and verse 13, listen carefully.
[time=2918] Verily, verily, I say unto you, wherever this gospel shall be preached, in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told.
[time=2932] For a memorial for her.
[time=2934] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2936] Jesus said when this whole thing was over, wherever the gospel is preached, throughout the whole wide world, wherever it is preached, what this woman has done today in loving me and sacrificially giving to me, it's going to be a memorial to her.
[time=2950] Everybody will know it.
[time=2952] You don't hear much about Martha.
[time=2954] Lazarus, you know, because he came back from the grave.
[time=2956] And I'll tell you, Mary of Bethany has gone down in history as a woman who loved her God unconditionally, sacrificially and lavishly.
[time=2968] But Judas became famous too, didn't he?
[time=2970] Sure he did.
[time=2972] Do you know that until the day when Judas was born, that was a popular name?
[time=2976] One of the great patriots of the Jewish people was a man by the name of Judas Maccabeus.
[time=2982] He lived in that period of 400 years between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[time=2986] He was a great hero to the Jews.
[time=2988] If you're watching the television program that is coming on about Masada, you most likely will hear about Judas Maccabeus.
[time=2998] But from the moment that Judas betrayed Jesus and men and women, he didn't betray him in a night, the greed and graft and selfishness of his own heart, which is exhibited in this illustration,
[time=3010] culminated on the day when he sold his Lord for 30 pieces of silver because he was a materialist.
[time=3016] And from the day that he betrayed Jesus, the name Judas is a no-no.
[time=3024] I doubt if there's anyone in this congregation has a son named Judas.
[time=3028] We wouldn't do that to one of our children, not knowingly.
[time=3032] Do you know that in agriculture there is an animal called a Judas goat?
[time=3038] And it gets its name from the fact that it is used by the people in the slaughterhouses to lead the lambs that are going to be slaughtered down the chute where unknowingly they will ultimately meet their death.
[time=3048] And they call the animal that does that the Judas goat.
[time=3052] Where did he get his name? He's a traitor.
[time=3054] Judas is famous too.
[time=3056] He became famous for his greed and his miserly betrayal of the Lord Jesus for his unwillingness to face one who had given his life for him and love him with his whole heart.
[time=3066] In essence, in our lives men and women we are going to be known somewhere along the way by one distinction or the other.
[time=3076] Either as a Mary who loved her God with all of her heart and gave of herself to him because of what he meant to her.
[time=3084] Or because of the characteristics of materialism that grip our heart and cause us to grab everything around ourselves and forget about the Lord who loved us.
[time=3094] There's an interesting statement in this passage of Scripture that says that when Mary poured this sacrifice out upon her Lord, now it says this, listen, that the odor filled the house.
[time=3110] How did that happen?
[time=3112] Well you see the men all gathered around the table and the women served the men and Mary when she came to anoint Jesus with the sacrifice of her gift.
[time=3120] When she poured this upon Jesus she obviously spilled it off on herself.
[time=3124] It was on her hands, it was in her hair.
[time=3128] And so from that moment on wherever Mary went in that house, the smell and the odor and the perfume of what she had done for her Lord went with her.
[time=3138] And that's the way it is today.
[time=3140] When we give to God, when we honor him with our substance, when we sacrificially deal with our Lord, it spills back over onto us.
[time=3150] And it follows us wherever we go.
[time=3152] And that's the real motivation for giving to God, shall we pray.
[time=3160] Father in Heaven, this is Thy word.
[time=3166] It instructs us and it challenges us to be stewards unto our Lord.
[time=3172] There are men and women in this congregation and some who watch by television, who have taken and taken and taken from God.
[time=3180] He has blessed them untold many times and yet they have never stopped as did Mary to say to the Lord in a tangible way, dear Lord, I love you.
[time=3190] I pour out this.

[time=3308] Speaking for Pastor David Jeremiah, this is Jack Gray inviting you to join us next week at the same time for the Sunday morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3320] The Bible hour has been made possible by the members of the Founders Club.
[time=3324] The Founders Club is a group of committed Christians who regularly and faithfully support this outreach ministry.
[time=3334] I know that one of the things you have appreciated about the Bible hour over the years that has been on the air is that we have not used the television time to ask for financial support.
[time=3346] We have done that specifically because we have been committed to the fact that the Bible hour television time needs to be used to present the Word of God and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3358] But today I must come to you and ask for your help as you have listened to the television program today and heard me address some of the needs that we have in our own congregation.
[time=3368] You probably have thought that perhaps those needs were just church centered, but frankly they cover the entire broad base of the many ministries that go out from this place.
[time=3380] One of the most expensive ministries is the Ministry of Television and Radio. During the first few weeks of this new year we have seen the expenses continue to increase and yet the giving has not kept up with its pace in the past year.
[time=3398] That means that many who have helped before have stopped doing what they have done in the past or perhaps they have channeled their giving in another direction.
[time=3408] Whatever the reason I know that at this particular time we need your help as never before.
[time=3414] Many of you that I meet as I travel around the Midwestern part of our country tell me that the Bible hour is a great blessing to your life that you never miss it.
[time=3422] And yet when we go through the mail we very seldom hear from some of you folks. You watch, you participate, you share, you are blessed, but you never take the time to sit down and write us a letter and closing a gift to help in that which is ministering to your own life.
[time=3438] I want to ask you to do that this week because we need your help and we need for each and every one of you who participate in this ministry to sit down and make a generous gift to the ministry of the Bible hour during these coming days.
[time=3452] If you do not and if we cannot see the growth of our income from those who participate in the ministry, then we will have to take the same measures that are being contemplated for some other areas of the ministry here.
[time=3464] And that is to sit down and calculate where we can best expend the money and cut the ministry where it is not being cost effective.
[time=3474] We don't want to do that because we believe the word of God needs to go out without apology and without constant begging and pleading for money so that God's word is not construed to be a financial matter by those who listen outside of the faith.
[time=3490] I'm not asking for those of you who do not know Christ to help but I am asking for our many friends who belong to the family of God and believe in this Bible centered ministry to sit down today and do something special for the Bible hour television and radio program.
[time=3506] When you think about what God has done through this work over these past five years, give a generous love offering to him even as Mary gave to her Lord, make it sacrificial, make it specifically for the work of the spreading of the Word of God.
[time=3522] And when you send your gift, send it to the Bible hour office, just address your letter to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3534] Your gift is tax deductible and we will send you a receipt, but most of all, it is honoring to God and it responds to his love for you by giving sacrificially back to him and to a work which honors his name and his word.
[time=3550] Thank you so very much for your help at this time. May God continue to use you as his servant in the spreading of the Word of God through the Bible hour.
