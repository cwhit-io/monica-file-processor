[time=0] (bell ringing) (majestic music)
[time=27] From the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=36] [MUSIC]
[time=40] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=49] And we welcome you to this service,
[time=55] all of you who have gathered here in the auditorium here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=59] This is Palm Sunday and this service is being seen in other places across the Midwestern part of our country and it is not that Sunday where you are, but we know that what we share together today from the Word of God and in music will be a blessing to your heart and we're glad that you've joined with us.
[time=76] We pray that the Bible Hour today is it reaches out into many homes across the Midwestern part of the country will bring joy and blessing into many lives.
[time=85] We're grateful for the music that accompanies the truth of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=93] We have some great music planned for you today.
[time=96] We begin right now with the first of the music from our choir.
[time=101] (gentle music)
[time=115] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=223] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=342] - And the truth of the resurrection is always sung
[time=356] with a dynamic presentation like that.
[time=359] Now, the young people from the children's choir are coming to get in place.
[time=364] And while they're coming, I don't know if we can do this or not, but we recently in our church spent a great deal of intensive prayer on behalf of a little girl by the name of Hanalee's hepler.
[time=377] And God raised her up from the brink of death and restored her to life.
[time=381] And her parents are celebrating her return to church and her return to health and strength.
[time=387] And they presented me this morning with a beautiful flower in honor of the recovery of Hanalee's.
[time=393] It's over on the organ.
[time=394] I don't know if you can see it, there it is.
[time=396] And we just want to rejoice with the heplers.
[time=400] So often when someone is sick, we pray that they will be healed.
[time=404] And then when they are better, we forget to thank the Lord for what He's done.
[time=409] They had a getting well party, a celebration party for Hanalee's.
[time=413] And I think that's a great idea.
[time=415] We love our children.
[time=417] God has blessed our congregation with many beautiful, lovely children.
[time=422] And they're going to sing for us now.
[time=424] And I hope you will not only listen as they sing, but watch their expressive faces as they tell the story of Jesus Christ in music.
[time=431] The children's choir.

[time=598] - We're so happy to have you with us today
[time=610] on the Bible Hour, and Don and I really enjoy this opportunity to be with you together in this very personal time in your own home.
[time=618] Today we are together, except in the way we're dressed.
[time=621] She's in white, and I'm in black, and that provides a little contrast on the screen, I'm sure we wanna take just a moment to bring you up to date on some of the things that really are of important interest to you who are part of the Bible Hour family.
[time=635] First of all, Donna, how about an update on the new stations that we have added to our radio log?
[time=641] - We've promised to share with you each week a couple of the stations that are carrying the Bible Hour at this time, in Cedarville, Ohio, on WCD-R-FM, on Sundays at 4.30 in the afternoon.
[time=654] You may listen to the Bible Hour, and also in Omaha, Nebraska, on KGBI-FM, on Saturdays at 6.30 PM.
[time=663] - We hope that many of you who have loved ones in the areas where the Bible Hour is being heard on radio will take time to write them and let them know to be sure and listen.
[time=673] We also want to remind you that we have a complete listing of all of the stations the Bible Hour is heard on on radio, and if you'd like to have a copy of that listing, we'd be happy to send it to you.
[time=683] We've been so very gratified with the response to the daily walk.
[time=686] When we began this addition to the Bible Hour Ministry two years ago, we weren't sure what kind of response we would get, but every week the ministry grows with more and more people reading through the Bible and studying the Word of God consecutively from cover to cover.
[time=702] We'd like to make the daily walk available to all of our Bible Hour friends because we really believe that it's a good way for you to study the Word of God.
[time=711] It's not an easy read-a-versa-scripture and go-on-your-way method.
[time=715] And some folks, well, that's all they have time for.
[time=718] If that's what you're looking for, you won't want to be involved in the daily walk.
[time=722] But if you want to seriously study God's Word, if you want to learn what it has to say, and if you want to come away from your devotional time, rich your spiritually than when you began, you'll find that the daily walk is just what you're looking for.
[time=736] We get letters almost every day from people who have started in the daily walk ministry and are finding new and exciting truths and are growing and being built up in the things of the Lord.
[time=746] The daily walk is available to you if you will call or write us for information.
[time=751] We'll tell you how you can be enrolled every month to receive your special daily walk guide.
[time=757] It has an assignment of scripture for you to read, a brief commentary, an application of the truth of your own life and the memory verse, which will stay with you throughout the week and help to encourage you in your spiritual growth.
[time=769] We'd like to send the daily walk to you and we will do that if you will do this.
[time=774] Simply call us at 1-800-4539,000 or write to us.
[time=779] Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=785] We'll give you that address and that phone number again.
[time=787] But I do want to encourage you to get involved in reading the Bible.
[time=790] It's a great way to grow spiritually and we believe it's an extension of the Bible hour right into your own home and into your own life.
[time=797] - We have another little booklet which we have been offering for several weeks and we've had good response to this also.
[time=803] It's the Gospel of John and it is highlighted in different colors pertaining to different aspects of Christ's life and ministry.
[time=810] For instance, the part that is highlighted in green emphasizes the deity of Christ.
[time=816] And this is really a helpful little tool to have if you're studying the life of Christ and are interested in working in the Gospel of John as we've been studying it together even.
[time=827] We would like to send you a free copy of this and you may call us again at our toll-free number 1-800-4539,000 for our mailing address, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=842] - Donna, before you share with us the sponsor who is helping us with the broadcast today, let me just take a moment of time to share a word with our listeners and viewers concerning a special letter that went out from my office this past week.
[time=856] Many of you have already received it.
[time=858] Some of you will be receiving it in a few days.
[time=861] We have tried to communicate to you by way of mail, the need that we have financially at this time.
[time=867] And if you heard the telecast last week, you know that we try to handle those as much as we can up front and not make them a weekly time problem on our television program because we wanna use that time to encourage your life and to preach the Gospel.
[time=883] We don't ever want the Bible hour to become an hour of promotion and please.
[time=888] But we do have needs just like every other ministry and sometimes during the year we have to remind you of your part in making this program available to the many thousands who depend upon it for spiritual food and encouragement.
[time=901] If you haven't written to us recently or perhaps if you've never written to us, I'd like to encourage you to do that today.
[time=907] Just to sit down and write to us at the Bible hour office and close a gift for as much as you possibly can to help during this time.
[time=914] And I know that God will be honored by your gift and I promise you that every single dime of your gift will go back into the preaching and teaching of the Word of God through media, into your home and many others like yours.
[time=928] We need to hear from you and we appreciate so much your response to this special announcement during this time.
[time=934] - And we have an associate sponsor this morning.
[time=938] It's Mr. Arthur Lehman of Fort Wayne, Indiana who is sponsoring the Bible hour in this area today.
[time=944] Mr. Lehman, we certainly say thank you and appreciate so much your part in the Bible hour ministry.
[time=950] - Donna, before we go back to the morning service, let me just again remind these folks of the phone number and the address.
[time=957] A telephone number to call for your copy of the gospel of John, the special edition or the daily walk or for information about how to become an associate sponsor.
[time=966] Simply call 1-800-4539,000.
[time=970] Most of all, we'd like to ask you to write to us during this time.
[time=973] We need to hear from you through the mail and the address that you need to have down on paper so that you will have it at hand when you're ready to write as this.
[time=981] Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=988] It's an easy address, but it won't do you any good unless you use it.
[time=992] So sometime today, sit down and write to us.
[time=994] We'd so much like to hear from you and we thank you for your continued prayer and support as we hold forth the word of life through the Bible hour television program.

[time=1103] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=1133] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=1190] (gentle piano music) - Thank you, David.
[time=1205] Several months ago, it's been years now, I guess, we had the wonderful privilege of going to the land of Israel and visiting the Holy Land.
[time=1215] And in the process went to Rome and France and a few other places and I can never, ever express to you the tremendous thrill that was ours when we walked in some of the sacred places where the Lord walked during his earthly ministry.
[time=1232] The garden tomb, Golgotha, the city of Bethlehem and all throughout the city of Jerusalem, a thrilling thing that actually made the Bible come alive.
[time=1243] I hope that the Lord preserves our privilege of visiting Israel and preserves all of our health so that again someday soon, many of us can go and visit that place.
[time=1254] Each year at Easter time, we always think about the Holy Land and right now, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have come to the Holy City for the special time of the resurrection of our Savior.
[time=1269] There is a song that usually is sung sometime during the season that reminds us of what it was like when Jesus walked this earth and what it is like to walk where he walked and to visualize and think about all of the things he did while here on this earth.
[time=1286] Just before the message from the Gospel of John, Leno Peterson is going to remind us of what it was like when we walked where Jesus walked.
[time=1296] (gentle music)
[time=1308] [MUSIC - 208 seconds]
[time=1521] - And one of the exciting things about being a part
[time=1533] of a church that teaches and preaches the Bible is that even when you can't go there physically, every Sunday and yet every day of your life, when you open the pages of the New Testament, you can walk with the Lord Jesus through his earthly life as the story unfolds right in front of you.
[time=1552] And we have been doing that in our church.
[time=1554] We have been walking through John's account of our Lord's life and ministry.
[time=1560] And we are in a series of messages now called the seven great statements of Christ or the seven I ams of the Lord.
[time=1569] Seven times in John's gospel, Jesus said, "I am." I am the bread of life, I am the light of the world, I am the true vine, I am the resurrection and the life, I am the door, I am the good shepherd.
[time=1584] These statements and there are seven of them are statements by the Lord Jesus concerning pictures of his person.
[time=1594] Today we are studying together the 10th chapter of John's gospel where Jesus says, "I am the door." And I want us to read for our scripture lesson this morning, John's gospel, chapter 10, verses one through 10.
[time=1609] John's gospel, chapter 10, verses one through 10.
[time=1613] I love it when we read the scripture together aloud and may we stand together please to read from this portion of God's word.
[time=1620] John chapter 10, verses one through 10.
[time=1626] Let us read together.
[time=1628] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climb it up some other way.
[time=1638] The same is a thief and a robber, but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
[time=1646] To him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out.
[time=1655] And when he put forth his own sheep, he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice.
[time=1665] And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers.
[time=1673] This parable spoke Jesus unto them, but they understood not what things they were which he spoke unto them.
[time=1682] Then said Jesus unto them again.
[time=1685] Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
[time=1691] All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
[time=1698] I am the door by me if any man enter in.
[time=1703] He shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.
[time=1708] The thief comeeth not but to steal and to kill and to destroy.
[time=1714] I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.
[time=1721] While we are standing, shall we bow together in prayer.
[time=1725] Our God in heaven, we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the good shepherd and the great shepherd and the chief shepherd.
[time=1738] And we who are of his flock, the family of God, give thanks today for the sacrifice which he made for us,
[time=1749] for he laid down his life for his sheep.
[time=1753] We thank you, O Father, for the leadership of the shepherd.
[time=1758] He leadeth us, O blessed thought.
[time=1762] We thank you, our Father, that when we go astray, the good shepherd comes to discipline us and bring us back into the fellowship of the fold.
[time=1774] And we are grateful today, O God, that the entrance into the flock of God is made so very plain and simple in the word, so that those who are yet to know him, those who have not yet come to understand what it means to be a part of God's flock, of God's family, can come to know him and can find entrance into the fellowship of the Father.
[time=1798] We thank you for this portion that we are to study today, make it live within our hearts.
[time=1802] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1804] The picture of a shepherd and his sheep
[time=1817] was most appropriate in the days of our Lord.
[time=1821] For one of the most common occupations in the time of our Lord's earthly ministry was the occupation of a shepherd.
[time=1830] Throughout the Old Testament, Abraham and Moses and Jacob and Samuel and David and Amos the prophet
[time=1841] and Jeremiah the prophet and many others were shepherds.
[time=1845] So when our Lord spoke in terms of the shepherd and his sheep and he used a picture relative to sheep herding,
[time=1856] he was speaking the language of the people and they could understand immediately what he was saying.
[time=1862] When we traveled to Israel, it was not an uncommon thing.
[time=1867] At least once a day, we would have to pause along the streets while the sheep were herded across the highway.
[time=1874] In Israel today, there are many, many who are shepherds and sheep herding is a very common profession.
[time=1882] Now in the cities in the land of Palestine where the sheep herders lived and where they earned their living out on the hillsides and in the grassy regions around the city, in each of those major cities where the sheep herders lived, there was a huge sheepfold.
[time=1900] It was sort of a central depositing place for the sheep of the many pastures.
[time=1906] And after the sheep had grazed for many days, the shepherds would bring their flocks back into the city and they would bring them to the central sheepfold and they would there give these sheep into the fold and the scripture speaks of one who guarded the door of the fold called a porter.
[time=1924] He was in charge of the central sheepfold and the shepherds would bring their sheep and give them to the porter and he would take them into the sheepfold and then all of these various herds would be together in this gigantic, huge sheepfold.
[time=1938] Now the scripture says in the first few verses that we have read that when it was time for the shepherd to retrieve his flock, they didn't have them branded as we do today, but the shepherd would go to the door of the great sheepfold and he would call his sheep and it is an interesting thing that the sheep would hear the voice of their own shepherd and those who belong to that shepherd would just walk right out of the fold and follow the shepherd out to the pasture land.
[time=1965] It is a overwhelming thing, a unique thing that is hard for our minds to comprehend it.
[time=1971] It is still true today.
[time=1973] I am told that on one occasion two shepherds tried to violate this principle and they changed dress and changed clothes and they walked into the sheepfold to call their sheep and even in spite of that the sheep followed the voice, not the person and they followed their sheep out of the fold.
[time=1991] Now Jesus is telling this story for a very specific purpose.
[time=1994] He is using this parable to answer a problem that had arisen in the ninth chapter of John.
[time=2000] Some of you remember that we studied John chapter nine where the Lord healed a blind man and where he brought sight back to his eyes and the Pharisees and the religious leaders of Israel were very upset about that miracle because it validated the Messiah claims of Jesus Christ.
[time=2017] So angry were they according to the ninth chapter that after they had quizzed this blind man and after they could no longer deal with the truth of his being able to see having been blind.
[time=2029] According to the 34th verse of chapter nine they threw this blind man out of the synagogue.
[time=2037] They excommunicated him from fellowship among them.
[time=2040] They said you don't belong to us anymore and they threw him out of fellowship.
[time=2044] And then at the end of the ninth chapter the Lord Jesus begins to speak to these Pharisees who had been so hostile toward the blind man and also toward Jesus Christ.
[time=2054] And in verses 39 to 41 this is what we read.
[time=2057] And Jesus said chapter nine for judgment I am coming to this world that they who see not might see and that they who see might be made blind.
[time=2068] And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also?
[time=2074] Jesus said to them if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sin remaineth.
[time=2081] When Jesus spoke to the Pharisees the ones who had kicked the blind man out of the synagogue he was saying to them you are false teachers you are false shepherds you are trying to lead but you're leading astray and there's only one shepherd who can come into the sheepfold of Israel and take someone out of that into Christianity and I am that shepherd.
[time=2103] And anyone who tries to do anything other than that according to chapter 10 is like a thief or a robber who climbs up over the wall of the sheepfold and goes in and tries to steal a little lamb out of the sheepfold.
[time=2116] But Jesus said I am the shepherd who when I come into the sheepfold and I lead someone out of Israel into the presence of the community of Jesus Christ they follow me.
[time=2127] And if you have been studying John's gospel with us you know that that's exactly what Jesus was doing.
[time=2132] Little by little here one and there one he was going into the sheepfold of Israel and calling out individuals to become Christians he called Nicodemus and Nicodemus became a Christian he came to the woman at the well in chapter five and he witnessed to her and she became a Christian and he led her forth out of the sheepfold of Israel and he called here one and there one all of those back in the second chapter that he called to be his disciples that was the purpose of Jesus Christ.
[time=2161] So chapter 10 you see is Jesus way of saying to these religious leaders you're thieves and you're robbers and you're climbing up some other way and you don't know what this is all about I am the only true shepherd and you folks you Pharisees you're not the true shepherds.
[time=2177] Now that's the picture in the first few verses of chapter 10 in those verses Jesus Christ is the good shepherd but when we come to verse seven the whole picture changes and let me explain when the shepherds took their sheep out of the central sheepfold and they went out to the hillsides of Bethlehem of Judea and the other places in Palestine there to herd their sheep and to let them graze at nighttime when the shepherds would bring their sheep together it was necessary for them to provide a way of protection and so the shepherd would find a central place to the grazing lands and he would collect stones and boulders and twigs and rocks and logs and he would build a round sheepfold a rather temporary one with the walls just high enough to keep animals out and to keep the sheep in and he would build this in a circular fashion leaving only one opening into the fold into the temporary fold and then after he got all of his sheep into that place of protection at night the shepherd would lie down in the opening and he would be the door into the sheepfold and so no sheep could get out unless they walked across the shepherd and no animals could get in unless they walked across the shepherd it was literally true that the shepherd in the sheepfold out on the hillside was the door into the fold and Jesus Christ using that picture spoke to the people of Israel and to our hearts as well and he said in John 10, 9 and 10 I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall go in and out and find pasture in verses 7 through 10 Jesus has changed the picture now and he is talking about the sheepfold of fellowship with God and abundant living and he is saying that the only way anyone gets into that sheepfold is to go through the one door the only door who is Jesus Christ you must come in through the door to get into the sheepfold now with that background in mind which is very necessary for us to understand this passage of scripture I want you to notice some of the things that Jesus teaches us concerning Himself and salvation and truth with the picture of the shepherd who is the door into the sheepfold first of all I want you to notice the exclusive nature of the door in John chapter 10 in verse 9 Jesus very emphatically claims to be the exclusive door into the sheepfold he says emphatically and he is saying it for the benefit of the Pharisees understanding they're listening to him I and nobody else am the door I as opposed to all others who claim to be the door the religious leaders and the Pharisees and Sadducees of the day Jesus said I am the door and then he emphasizes it again at the end of the verse by using this phrase by me if any man enter in twice in that verse Jesus says he is the door into the sheepfold of God's provision and abundant living now that is a truth which is met with great opposition by the religious community of our day we are often called narrow-minded sometimes I have heard the phrase narrow-minded bigoted Baptist all of them said with great emphasis and I don't necessarily relish being called a bigot I don't mind being called a Baptist I don't mind being called narrow-minded but let me say something to you folks I want to be just as narrow-minded as God is and if God is narrow-minded about a subject I want to be narrow-minded about that too and when it comes to getting into the fold of God God is narrow-minded he says there's one way in and that's it and the way you get into the fold of God is through Jesus Christ the Son of God there is no other way there is no other opportunity if you don't go in by the door you can't get in and John's gospel speaks of that often for instance one of the other I am statements is found in John 14 6 where Jesus said listen now I am the way the truth and the life that's plain isn't it well listen it's not finished no man cometh unto the Father but by me that's what Jesus said and over in the book of Acts chapter 14 in verse 12 we read neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name under heaven
[time=2459] given among men whereby we must be saved how do you get into the fold the door is exclusive in nature you go in only through Jesus Christ now it is fascinating to me that in the old testament in all of the pictures of salvation this image is protected when Noah was called of God to build an art for the safety of his family when the judgment of God was coming down upon a wicked earth the scripture says that he built that arc and he built any mence arc and it would have been very convenient for there to be many entrances and exits in and out of the arc of safety but how many doors were there class there was one door and everybody who got into that arc walked through that one door all of the animals went in all of the people went in all of the insects went in everybody went through the one door now why did God do that he did that so that the picture of salvation which would later be explained to all of the world would be intact there is one way there is one entrance into the presence of an almighty God and into the arc of his safety and that is through the person of Jesus Christ when Moses built the tabernacle that was to accompany them on their wilderness journeys there was one way into the presence of the holy of holies only one door only one entrance you could not get in any other way it was only through the one central door that you could find entrance into the presence of God and men and women no matter what they say today no matter how many well-meaning and broad-minded theologians there may be preaching from pulpits of our land either on television or on the radio or printing their materials in booklets no matter what they say God says if you want to come into the fold of God's blessing if you want to know salvation you only have one way to get there and that's through Jesus Christ the Son of God there is no other way and as you think about this story that we are telling of the sheepfold it makes sense can you imagine the shepherd constructing his little sheepfold out in the wilderness there where the wolves and the wild animals are and he herds all of his sheep into the fold and he leaves the opening for himself where he will lay down and protect the sheep and as he's about to go to bed at night he says you know it really isn't very broad-minded of me just to have one door why there might be a sheep who would want to get out from the back part of the sheepfold and so he goes and removes four or five rocks and he leaves a back door so that that door would be available to the sheep now there are two ways in and out you know what happened either the all the animals would come in and the sheep would be dead the next morning or all the sheep would go out and the shepherd would wake up to an empty fold you see the one door picture of the sheepfold is intact so that we would understand the lesson God would teach to us and that is this that Christ is the only way into the family of God he is the door and anyone who gets into God's family comes through the person of Jesus Christ and that's why in the book of Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 18 we are told that through him Christ we have access unto the Father
[time=2641] that is why in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 20 we are told that Jesus Christ is the new and the living way into the presence of God I know this is a truth which we who are Christians here often but I cannot emphasize it enough if you're looking for some other way besides Jesus Christ you will never get into the fellowship of God for Jesus Christ is the only way that's the first lesson I want you to notice secondly not only the exclusive nature but I want you to notice the exciting provision on the other side of the door what happens when you get in the fold well the Scripture is very clear the Bible says if you enter in you shall be what does it say saved say that out loud with me saved now that's not a bad word is it
[time=2689] all along now we are trying to avoid using that word we're talking about coming to faith about being converted and born again but the Bible uses this term it says when you come by Christ into the fold of
[time=2703] God you have been saved you have salvation what does it mean to be saved it means to be saved from eternal damnation it means to be saved from hell's fire it means to be saved from being out of the presence of God for eternity it means to be saved unto a new and better living on this earth and to eternity forever with God in heaven to be saved is to be salvaged out of the race of Adam and placed into the race of Jesus Christ the second Adam and to be preserved for something better than what you had before Christ walked into your life and Jesus said when you walk through the door of the sheepfold who is Jesus Christ and you get on the inside the first thing you notice is that you have salvation you have been saved I don't mind hearing that term
[time=2751] and I don't mind saying to all of you praise God I have been saved
[time=2758] I put my trust in Jesus Christ I'm in the fold of the father and I have been saved by his grace but notice it does not stop there
[time=2768] if salvation were all we had it would be worth walking through the door but that's not all it says secondly he are saved and you go in and out and find pasture now there are some well-meaning expositors who say that this verse teaches that once you are in the family of God sometimes you're in sometimes you're out you go in and you go out but I want to remind you that the one who leads you in and out is Christ the good shepherd and obviously the good shepherd isn't leading anyone out of fellowship with God that's not what it means at all the term in and out is an Old Testament Hebrew expression which is very interesting it really means security let me read a couple of passages from the Old Testament in Deuteronomy chapter 28 in verse six we read these words blessed shall thou be when thou comest in and blessed shall thou be when thou goest out and listen to Psalm 121 in verse 8 the Lord shall preserve thy going in and thy coming out from this time forward even forevermore the phrase to go in and out means this
[time=2833] that you are secure in the leadership of your shepherd so much so that you have freedom to move about in his kingdom without fear of being destroyed and being devoured and so what the psalmist teaches us in Psalm 23 when he talks about going in and out and finding pasture and what the Lord is teaching us here in John 10 is this when you walk through the door who is Jesus Christ into the sheepfold you have salvation first of all but secondly you have security you are no longer aware of being under the oppression of Satan and you no longer have to fear eternal destruction but you are secure in his presence and some of the greatest verses that teach that are right here in this passage beginning at chapter 10 verse 28 we read these words and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father who gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father I want what is Jesus saying he is saying once you get into the fold of the father you are secure in his presence and in his leadership and in his protection and how many of us who are Christians pass by that truth so very rapidly
[time=2911] we never pause to say Lord thank you for the security that I have in your presence and in your leadership and in your protection because I'm in the fold and you're the shepherd who's at the door now thirdly I want you to notice that when you go through the door who is Jesus Christ into the fold of God's fellowship you not only have salvation and security but you have sustenance or supply he shall go in and out and find what pasture what is pasture to a sheep why pasture to a sheep is food it is fodder it is grass it is that which keeps the sheep alive and obviously for the Christian the pasture or the food is that which we find in God's word
[time=2954] in the 23rd Psalm the Psalmist puts it this way the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth me in green pastures
[time=2964] he restoreth my soul he maketh me to lie down in green pastures
[time=2970] he leadeth me beside the stilled waters and when I read that I just get so excited because he's talking here about getting into the word of God so that you are just wallowing around in it there's so many Christians that I know who like the pastures if they can get a blade here and a blade there and a little bit of grass over here and nibble a little bit on Sunday here but the Bible talks about being led into the green pastures of God's word and the psalmist says it is so rich and full and abundant you can lie down and roll around in it you can wallow in the provision of God for your own soul one of the reasons you come to this church is because every Sunday morning and evening when we open the book the under shepherd who is your pastor has been out fine in a good place for you to graze and he's been looking around in the pastures of the word of God trying to find out where the sheep are going to eat this Sunday and we've lighted down on chapter 10 and we're wallowing around in John 10 just having a wonderful time believing all that's here and feeding our souls on the truth of the good shepherd who is the door into the sheepfold now the Bible says when you walk into the fold who is Jesus Christ and you're on the inside the things that you have on the inside or first of all you've got salvation and that's wonderful and secondly you go in and out in security and that's that's great and you have supply or sustenance for your life you feed on the pasture land now notice fourthly you have satisfaction in verse 10 the Lord Jesus compares himself or contrast himself to the hiring shepherds or the false shepherds he says in verse 10 the thief or the false shepherd or the Pharisees that's who he's talking about they come to steal and to kill and to destroy but I'm different than that says the Lord I've come for a totally different purpose I have come now listen that you might have life and that you might have life more abundantly
[time=3087] it is the truth of the word of God that his purpose in coming is that we might be satisfied in him the Lord is the God of
[time=3098] abundance we've been learning that in John when he created the wine out of water and served it at the marriage attain of Galilee why we did the mathematics he made enough wine to serve ten parties like the one he was responsible for and when he changed that little boy's lunch into enough food to feed the thousands the scripture says there were 12 baskets left over and when he teaches about the bread of life he says I am the bread of life if you eat of me you will never hunger why there's more than you could ever eat in ten lifetimes and he teaches the woman at the well that he is the water of life and if she comes to find sustenance in him she will never again get thirsty because there's always enough to go go on and on and on Jesus is the God of the abundant and he says he came into this world in order to make it possible for us to have an abundant life he promises that he will supply
[time=3154] all of our needs and that's why I believe the psalmist wrote Psalm 23
[time=3161] I remember hearing a story about a little girl who was trying to memorize that and she told her mother she was memorizing Psalm 23 and her mother said how does it go she says it goes like this the Lord is my shepherd and that's all I want and that was a mistake because that's not what it says but it was good theology because that's exactly what the Psalm teaches several years ago I think maybe four perhaps I spoke on the 23rd Psalm and devoted a whole Sunday to every verse and the truth that came through to our hearts over and over again was the fact that Jesus Christ is the God who is enough he has provided himself for us so that we will never want listen to the Psalm the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I shall not want for rest because he makes me to lie down in green pastures he leads me beside the still waters I shall not want for restoration for he restores my soul I shall not want for righteousness because he leadeth me in paths of righteousness I shall not want for relief for ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me I shall not want for refreshment for thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies I shall not want for recognition I'll notice my head with oil a regal picture of recognition I shall not want according to this Psalm for rejoicing for my cup runneth over I shall not want for resources for surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I won't even want for a residence
[time=3262] or I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you see it the psalmist is teaching us that in Jesus Christ the great shepherd there is abundant living may I say to you men and women as we look around in the christian church today and in our own church and we see folks who don't apparently have the abundant life it is no commentary against God for he has provided all that we need to be abundant in our christian life the reason some of us don't have abundant living is because we have filled our bellies so full of the food of the world there's nothing left for God to fill we have eaten so much of the materialism
[time=3298] of our generation that there's nothing left that God can use to feed us and give us the abundance of himself well that's it when you get into the fold through Jesus Christ you get salvation and you get security
[time=3314] and you get satisfaction and you get sustenance you get all those things in Jesus Christ now let me tell you something you still have to walk through the door that's why the scripture says buy me if any man what does it say enter in the door is there but you have to go
[time=3334] through there was a little song we sang when i was growing up in sunday school i don't remember all of it but part of it went like this one door and only one and yet it sides or two inside and outside on which side are you that's a good question
[time=3350] the door is there but to get on the inside you have to walk through the door and the question i would ask you today is have you walked through the door who is Jesus Christ into the sheepfold of his provision and the provision that he has made for us you can do that anytime that you please to do it for the door is always open to those who will come let us pray together father the door is open to those who will come
[time=3382] and we pray that today many who hear this message and those who share at home
[time=3389] will find in Jesus Christ the opening into the abundant life which he has
[time=3395] provided and may they walk through that door in faith believing today while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed
