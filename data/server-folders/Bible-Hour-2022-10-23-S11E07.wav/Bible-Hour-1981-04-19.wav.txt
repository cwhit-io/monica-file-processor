[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=44] (music)
[time=74] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=94] And we welcome you to this service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. It is Easter Sunday.
[time=100] And we only announce that because there are many who share in this particular hour who received this service a couple of weeks later by television through our tape network.
[time=109] We want you to enjoy with us the wonderful story of the resurrected Christ.
[time=114] And throughout this hour we will be speaking of him and lifting him up and sharing the truth of his overcoming death and conquering the grave and coming back to life.
[time=127] Because he lives, we too shall live. Throughout all of this hour, the music and the message will be about him and the fact that he is alive.
[time=138] For you who have joined with us here in the auditorium for this second service, as you have already discovered, we have been jammed to the walls in both services.
[time=148] We are grateful for your being here and for your patience with the crowd, and we trust this will be a wonderful time of celebration for all of us as we declare the truth of the risen Savior.
[time=158] We do it first with the ministry of our choir, the music of Easter.
[time=168] (Music) Who was the born into the tomb, there ain't no very phone.
[time=182] Surprised were they to see the soul of the brave.
[time=191] As they looked inside, they saw a angel in the white glow.
[time=201] The risen is the glory told them that it is.
[time=210] He is not here, he is risen.
[time=219] His final call he would not obey.
[time=228] He is standing high and in glory.
[time=237] He is alive today.
[time=250] (Music)
[time=313] He is alive today.
[time=337] (Music)
[time=366] We are so thankful for the opportunity to declare dynamically the truth of the risen Savior.
[time=374] We thank our choir for that presentation, and for all of you who live in this vicinity who receive the Bible Hour live as it comes from the auditorium, we invite you to share in the music of Easter with us tonight in a special Easter musical entitled "Then Came Sunday" which will be featured here in our facilities this evening at 7 p.m.
[time=395] There is only one presentation, so be sure to come early, the doors open at 6.30.
[time=401] We'd be happy to share with you the message of Easter in music this evening.
[time=405] How thankful we are for God's gift to us of Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=409] They are members of our church and part of the ministry here.
[time=412] They bless all of us whenever they sing, and they are singing a song of rejoicing today because Jesus is alive.
[time=420] Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=423] (Music) Joyful, joyful, we adore thee God of glory, Lord of love.
[time=436] Hearts and fold like flowers before the opening to the Son of Earth.
[time=445] Milled the clouds of sea that sang us through the dark of doubt away.
[time=454] Give a robin more to gladness, fill us with the light of day.
[time=464] (Music)
[time=477] Thou our lovey end, forgive me, ever blessing ever blessed, will spring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happiness.
[time=499] Thou our father, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thy teachers, how to love each other.
[time=514] Lift us to the joy divine.
[time=519] (Music)
[time=529] Rortles join the mighty chorus, weeks the morning stars began.
[time=540] Father, love is raining for us, brotherhood finds man to man.
[time=550] Ever singing much way onward, it goes in the midst of strife.
[time=561] Joyful music leads us on in the triumphs song of life with thy spirit.
[time=577] Lead us on earth in the triumphs song of life.
[time=594] A song of life.
[time=606] I'm sure you all know that here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church today is Easter Sunday.
[time=611] It is that for all of you here in Fort Wayne, but where you see this program in other markets, we're a little bit later than that.
[time=617] We want to share with you the joy of this Sunday and the joy of our family.
[time=622] As always, Donna's here with me to help share with you the things that pertain to the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=627] And I have somebody extra who is sitting on my lap, and this is our little girl, Jennifer.
[time=632] Jennifer's already had her little Easter surprise this morning, and she came home from school this week with an Easter surprise for us,
[time=639] and that she shared from memory all of the books of the New Testament.
[time=644] I thought you'd like to hear her do that, so Jennifer, you say them the best you can, okay?
[time=648] Matthew, Mark, Luke, Jack, Bax, Roman.
[time=651] It's the first good, the second good, the inspiration, visions, weapons, questions.
[time=656] First the story, the second the story, first Timothy, second Timothy.
[time=661] What's that?
[time=664] Start over again, right?
[time=666] I just thought he was, he was changed.
[time=668] First Peter, second Peter, first John, second John, third John, third John, third John.
[time=673] That was really good.
[time=675] You didn't have to start over either.
[time=676] You did really good.
[time=679] We have really a lot of joy in the ministry of our Christian school.
[time=683] Jennifer is in.
[time=685] - Pretty good.
[time=685] - She's in kindergarten and she's learned the Bible verses and the books of the Bible already and that's exciting.
[time=691] Donna, you have some things you need to share and I want you to do that as soon as I tell our friends about a new radio station that has just been added to the list.
[time=700] Many of you know that my brother Jim is a pastor in Limo, Ohio and we just received word this week that his church has taken the responsibility of sponsoring the radio version of the Bible hour on radio station WTGNFM 97.7 and it is heard in Limo at 830 every Sunday night.
[time=719] We thank the Meadowbrook Baptist Church and Jim and all the people in Limo and trust that the radio program will be a real blessing to them as it's heard there every Sunday evening.
[time=730] - We are still receiving many requests each week for the little gospel of John booklet which is a paraphrase of the gospel of John.
[time=739] It has underlineings in different colors and highlights for instance in green.
[time=744] If it's highlighted in green, it's emphasizing the deity of Christ.
[time=748] And we would like to send you your free copy of this paraphrase of the gospel of John.
[time=753] All you need to do is call us at our toll free number 1-800-453-9000 or you may write to us and write to pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=768] - Donna, we are so excited because so many of our Bible hour friends are reading the Bible through in the daily walk program.
[time=777] The daily walk is a monthly publication that comes from our office that leads you through a year's study of the entire scriptures beginning at the book of Genesis and reading through to the book of Revelation.
[time=788] All of those books that Jennifer mentioned a few minutes ago are in that study program.
[time=792] And if you enroll at any time during the year and stay with the program for 12 months, you will have read the entire scripture all the way through.
[time=800] Not only will you have read it, you will have studied it and you will understand much about it.
[time=805] Every week I receive letters from people who have enrolled in this program and are sharing the tremendous insight that God has given to them in the scriptures through the daily walk Bible study program.
[time=815] Once again, the daily walk is a part of the extended ministry of the Bible hour and we counted a privilege to be able to provide that through this ministry to those who request it and we'd be happy to share with you how you can get enrolled in the program if you'll just write to us or call us.
[time=831] And once again, the telephone number is 1-800-4539,000 and the address is post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=841] If you will get in touch with us and let us know of your desire to be in the daily walk program, we'll be happy to share that program with you as soon as we get your request.
[time=849] Before we go back to the morning service, Donna has a sponsor she wants to share with us.
[time=854] - We have an associate sponsor this morning from Grover Hill, Ohio.
[time=858] It's Floyd McClure and he watches the Bible hour on WPTA Channel 21.
[time=864] And we thank you, Mr. McClure, for your part in sponsoring the Bible hour today.
[time=868] - Donna, I want to take this opportunity to express to all of our friends who are watching by television, even though it may be late to some of them.
[time=876] The very best in this season of the year is we celebrate the living Christ who came back from the grave and validated his death on the cross for each and every one of us.
[time=885] The living Christ, as he has seen in the living word, is the purpose and the core of the Bible hour ministry.
[time=891] For all of you who have helped through your prayer and support, we thank you.
[time=895] God bless you during this season of the year when we think especially of him.
[time=899] (gentle music)
[time=908] (audience applauding) [MUSIC - 272 seconds]
[time=1188] (audience applauds) - And just in case you didn't recognize him,
[time=1201] that is Keith Brodigum.
[time=1203] He has added a few chin whiskers since we saw him the last time.
[time=1207] He is in an opera now that necessitates that for his character role.
[time=1212] But I'll tell you what, it didn't do anything to hurt his voice, did it?
[time=1215] He can sure sing.
[time=1217] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1218] I don't know if we could have Easter without the Holy City, and he does it as well as I've heard it done.
[time=1223] Just before the message, we're going to listen to the Black Hawk Singers as they speak about Jesus, the resurrection.
[time=1229] (gentle music)
[time=1242] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=1443] - Thank you, Black Hawk Singers, for introducing the message of resurrection from the Word of God with that musical presentation.
[time=1451] When Jesus stood before the tomb of Lazarus, he said, "I am the resurrection and the life." And then he raised Lazarus from the grave.
[time=1462] But he proved the truth of that statement when he himself came back from the grave of his own volition and in his own power, quickened by the spirit, he overcame death.
[time=1476] And the story of that part of his earthly ministry is why we celebrate Easter, and it is recorded for us in John's Gospel, beginning in the 19th chapter and the 38th verse, John chapter 19, verse 38.
[time=1497] Please follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1501] And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, be sought pilot that he might take away the body of Jesus, and pilot gave him leave.
[time=1516] He came therefore and took the body of Jesus, and there came also Nicodemus, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about in 100 pound weight.
[time=1528] Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes, with the spices as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
[time=1534] Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden, a new sepulcher in which was never man yet laid.
[time=1545] There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews preparation day, for the sepulcher was near at hand.
[time=1552] The first day of the week come with Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark unto the sepulcher, and seeeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.
[time=1561] Then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, they have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.
[time=1572] Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.
[time=1577] So they ran both together, and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.
[time=1583] And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying, yet when he not in.
[time=1590] Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and seeeth the linen clothes lying there.
[time=1597] And the cloth that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
[time=1603] Then went in also that other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw and believed.
[time=1610] For as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead.
[time=1614] Then the disciples went away again into their own home.
[time=1618] Over 400 years before Jesus Christ lived on this earth,
[time=1624] a man by the name of Socrates, the renowned Greek scholar and philosopher, drank the poison hemlock, and he lay down to die.
[time=1635] Shall we live again?
[time=1638] His friends asked.
[time=1642] The dying philosopher said, "I hope so." But no man can really know.
[time=1649] Later, the emperor Theodosius, having on a great occasion, opened all of the prisons, and releasing all of the prisoners, is reported to have said, "And now, would to God, I could open all the tombs, "and give life to the dead." In the Old Testament, a man by the name of Job, asked in the 14th chapter of the book that bears his name, this question.
[time=1676] If a man die, shall he live again?
[time=1679] In my estimation, that is the crucial question of the universe.
[time=1685] It is the question that asks in the vernacular of the people, is there any way for man to survive the grave?
[time=1693] Once he has died, may he live again?
[time=1697] It is the question that haunts every person, and that tests every religious belief.
[time=1703] The writer of Hebrews in the second chapter of that book says that there are some people who live all of their lives in the bondage of the fear of death.
[time=1713] It is this question about death, and life after death, that Easter answers.
[time=1721] Easter and its resurrection truth, places Christianity out of the realm of philosophy, and it places it into the realm of history.
[time=1731] The doctrine of the resurrection is central to the Christian faith.
[time=1737] Someone has said that it is the touchstone or the last stone to be placed in the arch of the Christian faith, and if that stone is not placed, the arch crumbles to the ground.
[time=1750] For all of the weight of Christianity rests against that focal point in the faith, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1759] For without the resurrection of our Lord, the death of Christ would not be validated, and his birth and life would have been in vain.
[time=1768] It is true that of all the great religions, Christianity alone bases its claim to an acceptance of the resurrection of its founder.
[time=1779] And if that resurrection is not a fact, according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, then those of us who preach are preaching in vain, and those of us who have believed have believed in vain, and the writers of the scripture who tell the story of the resurrection have purposefully lied, and the deliverance from sin by faith in Jesus Christ is a joke, and the hope of life after death, well, it's only the worst man's guess.
[time=1811] The resurrection of Jesus Christ is not peripheral to the Christian faith, it is central to the Christian faith.
[time=1819] More time ought to be spent studying and knowing the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ than all of the other doctrines put together.
[time=1828] Just as the poet has said, "If Easter be not true, then faith must mount on broken wing, and hope no more in mortal spring, then love must lose her mighty urge, and life proves a phantom and a dirge if Easter be not true." But men and women Easter is true, and the Bible declares that it's so, for the scriptures which we hold in our hands tell us that Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish prophet who claimed to be the Christ prophesied in the Jewish scripture, was arrested, judged a political criminal and crucified, and three days after his death and burial, some women came to the tomb to anoint his body, and they found that the body was gone.
[time=1884] His disciples claimed that God had raised him from the dead and that he had appeared to them many times before he finally ascended into heaven.
[time=1894] The truth of that story recorded in the New Testament is not only supported by all of the harmonistic accounts that appear in the gospels, but is given great credence by the secular historians such as Josephus and others who have recorded the truth of the resurrection.
[time=1914] So much so that one historian has said that there is more reason to believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead than there is to believe that Caesar Augustus ever lived.
[time=1926] I believe with all of my heart in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but it is not an emotional thing with me.
[time=1933] It is very rational, it is very historical, and yes, it is very scientific.
[time=1941] It is interesting to me that the record of Christ's resurrection is carefully protected, first of all, by the record of the security of his burial.
[time=1952] When he came down from the cross on that Friday, he was quickly placed into a tomb before the Jewish Sabbath would come, for the Jews were not allowed to bury on the Sabbath day, and the record of the security of his burial is the foundation upon which the understanding of his resurrection must be built.
[time=1974] I want you to notice with me how carefully the scripture records the events of the burial of the Lord.
[time=1981] And I will help you to remember these by giving you four or five things that tell about the security of the grave.
[time=1988] First of all, the Bible says that he was placed in a shroud or he was wrapped in the wrappings of the Jewish custom burial.
[time=1997] The body, according to history, was wrapped in linen clothes and John records that.
[time=2003] And in between the layers of the linen cloth was placed an ointment that was made out of spices and myrrh and mixed with aloes.
[time=2011] It was a gummy kind of a substance which was applied, first of all, to the body of our Lord after it had been washed in warm water.
[time=2019] And then the linen was wrapped around his body in the manner that the Jews buried.
[time=2024] Each individual limb wrapped separately and the trunk of the body and the legs wrapped separately.
[time=2030] And then as they wrapped the body in the custom of the Jews, they would place in between each of the layers that mixture of myrrh and spices and aloes, which was like the burial embalming of the Jews.
[time=2045] The scripture records that over a hundred pounds of that ointment was used in the burial of Jesus Christ.
[time=2052] I thought that was rather astounding until one time this week I read that when Herod was buried, it took 500 servants to carry the spices for his burial.
[time=2062] Jesus was wrapped in a shroud wrapped in the burial clothes of the Jewish people and he was in that particular form when he was placed into the tomb.
[time=2072] And some have said that even without the body of Jesus within that wrapping, that shroud would have weighed somewhere between 117 and 125 pounds.
[time=2084] That was the first matter that was taken care of when Jesus was buried.
[time=2088] But the Bible says that having been placed in the shroud and prepared for burial, they took him and they put him secondly in the sepulcher.
[time=2097] Now as we have read from John's account this morning, Jesus was buried in a tomb that was owned by Joseph of Arimathea.
[time=2105] If you were to go to Jerusalem today as we had the privilege of doing several years ago, you would discover that the Bible is very accurate when it describes the event of that day.
[time=2115] For you can stand in the garden of the tomb and in one eyesight you can see, Golgotha's hill where the crosses were and down below and a little bit to the left, you can see the picture or the opening into the tomb where Jesus was buried.
[time=2131] It was a tomb nigh to the place where he was crucified and it was a rich man's tomb owned by Joseph of Arimathea.
[time=2139] It is interesting that Isaiah the prophet in the Old Testament records that it would be so.
[time=2145] For Isaiah wrote in the 53rd chapter of the book which bears his name, that Jesus would find his grave assigned to be with the wicked, but yet he would be with a rich man in his death.
[time=2158] Isaiah saw down through the ages that Jesus would die the death of a criminal on the cross.
[time=2164] He would be assigned to the grave where the wicked men die, sometimes buried in an open pit and yet he would be rescued from that kind of a burial to be buried in a rich man's tomb.
[time=2176] And so it was for the scripture says that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus who had come to Jesus by night, came and begged the body of Jesus from Pilate and they brought the body and having prepared it, placed it in a tomb that was hewn out of a rock where never man had lain.
[time=2196] And that's where Jesus was buried in the sepulcher, in the tomb, in the rock.
[time=2201] He was in the shroud and he was in the sepulcher but the scripture goes on to record that a great stone was rolled in front of the door.
[time=2210] When we went to Jerusalem and we visited the garden of the tomb, we walked to where the tomb was and Donna and I walked into the tomb, we bent down and looked into the place where Jesus had been buried.
[time=2223] The opening into the tomb is about four and a half to five feet high and so if you're a tall person you have to bend down to look in and it's just barely wide enough for you to walk into.
[time=2235] And the scripture says that when Jesus was buried in the shroud, in the sepulcher that a great stone was rolled in front of that opening.
[time=2243] Now the way the Jews did that was to construct a groove in front of the tomb and then on an incline they would place the opening stone up high with a wedge underneath it so that when the burial took place they could release the wedge and the stone could be rolled down the groove and placed over against the opening of the tomb to keep the wild animals out and the grave robbers away it was the custom of the Jews.
[time=2269] There has been a great deal of research done into the size of the stone that must have been placed in front of the tomb and engineers who have studied it have said that a stone of the quality and kind that was present in that particular area large enough to cover the hole in that grave would have weighed approximately two tons and that stone was rolled against the opening of the tomb where Jesus was.
[time=2294] He was in a shroud in the sepulcher behind a stone but the scripture goes on to say that when the stone was placed in front of the grave that the Romans came and placed a seal across the grave.
[time=2308] Now Matthew records that they set a seal on the stone in Matthew 2766.
[time=2314] A Greek scholar by the name of A.T. Robertson says that this could be placed on the stone only in the presence of the Roman guard.
[time=2323] The purpose of the seal was to prevent anyone from tampering with the contents of the grave.
[time=2330] It went like this.
[time=2331] The guard would inspect the grave to validate that what was supposed to be in the grave was there.
[time=2337] Then the stone would be rolled in place and then they would affix the seal over the opening.
[time=2342] Now a Roman grave seal was an interesting and intricate thing.
[time=2346] It was a long piece of rope that was stretched across the stone and then it was fixed at each end of the opening in a wax seal.
[time=2356] And once the grave had been sealed and the rope across the stone had been placed the Roman government would seal it with their signet rings in the wax where the rope was affixed so that anyone bothering or tampering with the grave anyway putting tension on the rope or removing it they would break the Roman seal and it would be obvious that the security had been disturbed.
[time=2380] There is an incidence in the Old Testament and most of you know the story when Daniel was thrown into the lion's den.
[time=2387] We read in the sixth chapter of Daniel in verse 17 these words and a stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles so that nothing might be changed in regard to Daniel.
[time=2405] The purpose of the seal was to validate the contents of the grave so that no one would ever be able to dispute the fact that what was in the grave was the body of Jesus Christ that Roman seal was placed across the opening.
[time=2420] Henry Sumner Maine, a member of the Supreme Council of India a former professor of civil law at the University of Cambridge speaking on the legal authority attached to the Roman seal said this.
[time=2433] Seals in antiquity were actually considered as a mode of authentication.
[time=2438] In other words, the purpose of the seal was to say to everyone what is supposed to be in this grave is in the grave and this Roman seal authenticates that.
[time=2448] It also was there to protect history from ever saying that the body of Jesus had been removed before that early Easter morning.
[time=2457] Well, Jesus was there in the shroud, in the sepulcher behind the stone which was sealed by a seal and the Bible says that out in front were the soldiers.
[time=2469] Jewish officials panicked when Jesus died.
[time=2474] They actually were more afraid after his death than they were before.
[time=2479] For you see, thousands were turning to Jesus Christ and to avoid a political problem, it was to the advantage of both the Romans and the Jews to make sure that Jesus was put away for good.
[time=2491] So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together and they came to Pilate and we have their words recorded for us in Matthew 27, listen carefully.
[time=2502] Sir, they said to Pilate, we remember that when he, Jesus was still alive that the deceiver said, "After three days, I will rise again.
[time=2514] "Therefore, give orders for the grave "to be made secure until the third day, "lest the disciples come and steal him away "and say to the people, he is risen from the dead "and the last deception will be worse than the first." That's their concern.
[time=2532] And so the scripture says that Pilate gave to those Jewish leaders a Roman guard to stand in front of the sepulcher to make sure that it was not disturbed.
[time=2541] Now the Roman guard was a group of 16 men and according to Roman history, the guard was put in place as follows.
[time=2551] The four of the 16 who were on duty would stand outside of the place that was being guarded facing forward.
[time=2558] They were each to protect a certain section of the soil in front of them according to history.
[time=2563] And then the rest of the guard, not on duty at the time, would form a semi-circle in front of the four guards on duty facing toward the grave.
[time=2573] So that as you approach the grave where the guard was, you would have seen this sight for Roman soldiers looking straight at you and a semi-circle of 12 others facing toward the tomb.
[time=2584] And when the watch would change, the four on guard would go and take the place of four others in the circle and four fresh guards would stand in front.
[time=2592] And anyone coming to disturb the contents of that grave would have to have climbed over the 12 sleeping guards and gotten past the four awake guards to rob the content of the seplicker.
[time=2606] And so you see the security of the grave is very carefully protected in the record which we have in the word of God.
[time=2614] Jesus was wound up in a shroud placed in a seplicker behind a two-ton stone sealed with a Roman seal guarded by 16 Roman soldiers.
[time=2625] If only we would understand that much about the resurrection.
[time=2630] We could do away with many of the so-called theories that violate the actual account of what happened.
[time=2637] Now with that security in mind, let us examine what happened.
[time=2643] The first thing that took place when they came to that tomb on Easter Sunday was this.
[time=2648] They walked into the garden and whether they realized it or not, it must have been obvious to everyone that the soldiers were gone.
[time=2655] The Roman soldiers had gone AWOL.
[time=2657] They had left.
[time=2659] Dr. George Curry who studied carefully the military discipline of the Romans has said that the fear of punishment among the Romans produced a flawless attention to duty especially in the night watches.
[time=2672] What happened that frightened those soldiers away?
[time=2676] Well, if the stone had simply been rolled away from the tomb as would be necessary in order to enter it, well the men sleeping at their post would be punished severely but they would not have been killed.
[time=2689] If the men protested that an earthquake broke the seal, they would still be liable to punishment for behavior which might be like cowardice but they would not be killed.
[time=2700] But these possibilities do not meet this case.
[time=2703] There was some undeniable evidence which made it impossible for the chief priests to bring any charges against the soldiers.
[time=2710] For when these soldiers went back to Jerusalem and announced that the tomb was opened, obviously the Pharisees and the religious leaders came back to the grave and what they saw there saw blew their minds that they pressed no charges against the soldiers.
[time=2725] In fact, what did they do?
[time=2727] They bribed them and they said to them, "Take this money." And when anybody asks you what happened, you say the disciples stole his body.
[time=2734] The reason they did that was because what was happening at the grave and what took place that day was beyond any human explanation even at the risk of the death of those soldiers.
[time=2745] So when you approach the grave on Easter morning, you immediately notice that the outward protection is gone.
[time=2750] The soldiers have fled.
[time=2753] Secondly, you discover that the seal has been broken.
[time=2756] There is no longer any rope stretched across the opening.
[time=2759] The wax has been broken.
[time=2760] The rope has been discarded and the stone is gone.
[time=2763] The first obvious fact to any examiner of the resurrection story is that the broken seal represented the broken power and authority of the Roman government and anyone who broke a Roman seal according to the custom of Rome would be hung upside down in crucifixion.
[time=2781] No one, whatever, without serious thought, break a Roman seal.
[time=2787] But of course, when you first examine it, you think perhaps it was broken from the outside.
[time=2793] We know from our perspective that the seal was broken from the inside.
[time=2797] And then having noticed that the soldiers are gone and the seal is broken, you discover that the stone has been rolled away.
[time=2805] It is interesting to note how carefully the language of the New Testament guards what happened with the stone.
[time=2812] In the book of Matthew in the 27th chapter, we are told that when they placed the stone in front of the grave, they rolled it against the entrance of the tomb.
[time=2821] And there's a word used.
[time=2822] It's the word kuleo, the Greek word kuleo, which means to simply roll in place.
[time=2827] But when the scripture talks about the stone being rolled away, it changes the word.
[time=2833] It adds to the front of the word kuleo, the little preposition ona, ona kuleo, which means to roll up.
[time=2841] And it gives the impression that the stone was rolled back up the incline away from the opening of the tomb.
[time=2848] And when Luke speaks of it, he uses another preposition, which means to roll away from the mouth of it.
[time=2854] But I want you to notice how carefully John tells us what happened for in John chapter 20.
[time=2861] We are told that when this stone was rolled away, it was rolled clear away from the sepulcher.
[time=2868] Mary comes to the sepulcher.
[time=2870] And when it was yet dark, in verse one of chapter 20, she comes to the sepulcher and she seeeth the stone.
[time=2876] Notice the phrase, taken away from the sepulcher.
[time=2880] It is a word which means to actually pick it up and place it in a totally different location.
[time=2887] Sometimes when we tell the Easter story, we get the impression that what happened was that Jesus or someone or some power just nudged the stone away a little bit so he could slip out through the opening.
[time=2898] Men and women, that stone wasn't even next to the opening, the scripture says the stone, that two ton rock was picked up and located in a different part of the garden.
[time=2908] So that when they came to examine the tomb, they saw the opening and they saw the stone in a place it could not have gotten to without a supernatural power putting it there.
[time=2920] Someone has reminded us that the purpose of the stone being rolled away was not so that Jesus could get out but so that the people who came could look in.
[time=2932] So the soldiers are gone and the seal is broken
[time=2939] and the stone is rolled away and the sepulcher
[time=2945] is almost empty.
[time=2948] Isn't it interesting that this empty tomb is one of the most powerful evidence of the risen Christ any place in all of the history of that event?
[time=2958] I want to remind you that the disciples and those who preached the resurrection of Jesus Christ did not do it in Athens, Greece or in Rome but they preached that truth in Jerusalem, a 15 minute walk from the place where the tomb was empty.
[time=2973] Any skeptic, anyone who wanted to destroy the resurrection if they could have walked from Jerusalem to the grave and produced the body of Jesus Christ would have forever destroyed Christianity but they could not do that because the body was not there and the grave was indeed empty and no one disputes that fact.
[time=2993] Oh, they tried to give some of the theories as to how it happened and where Jesus was taken and how that took place from a human standpoint but the fact of history that has never been disputed even by the critics of Christianity is this that on Easter Sunday, the grave was empty but not quite.
[time=3014] No, it was almost empty.
[time=3018] In fact, I believe having studied this record again this year
[time=3025] that more powerful than the empty grave was what was left in the grave.
[time=3030] For the scripture says in the record we have read this morning that when John who was referred to as the other disciple came to the tomb, he looked into the tomb and what he saw in that tomb was this.
[time=3042] He saw the grave clothes lying by themselves in the place where Jesus had been within them.
[time=3052] Now, the language of the New Testament is very precise.
[time=3058] Jesus did not get up and unwind himself from the grave clothes.
[time=3064] No one came in and took him out of the shroud.
[time=3068] The scripture says that when John stooped down and looked into the grave, what he saw there was this.
[time=3074] He saw the encasement of the body of Jesus, the linen clothes that were held together by the sticky substance of the Murren aloes and he saw those grave clothes lying exactly as they would have been had Jesus' body been in them but his body was gone.
[time=3091] He rose right up out of those grave clothes leaving them intact.
[time=3097] Someone has said like an empty chrysalis
[time=3107] of a caterpillar's cocoon.
[time=3109] The clothes were there in the tomb.
[time=3115] I'll tell you what that would be enough to make a believer out of anybody, wouldn't it?
[time=3119] Somebody says, well, how did Jesus do that?
[time=3123] I don't know, but I do know that later on, he did something just like that because the disciples were gathered in a room and all of a sudden Jesus was in their midst and the scripture says carefully, he didn't come through the door, he didn't come through the window, he just was there.
[time=3135] And if Jesus can just be in the presence of his disciples without passing through the barriers, it is no problem for him and his resurrection body to come right up through his grave clothes, leaving them exactly where they were, but notice that wasn't the end.
[time=3150] The Bible says that the linen napkin that was around his head was folded and in a place by itself.
[time=3157] Not where his head had been, but in a place by itself away from the body.
[time=3164] It is like this, Jesus came up through the grave clothes, took the linen that was around his head, folded it up in a very orderly fashion and he placed it on one of the shelves in the tomb and then he walked out.
[time=3174] And when John stooped and looked in and saw that, the scripture says, he believed.
[time=3181] The soldiers were gone
[time=3189] and the seal was broken and the stone was moved to another place and the sepulcher was empty and the shroud was intact where Jesus had been buried.
[time=3204] And from that day during the next 40 days of history, Jesus appeared one after another to his disciples in the morning at night, at noon time, on the road to Emmaus in Galilee in Jerusalem.
[time=3217] He appeared to men and women and Paul writing to the Corinthians in the book that bears that name said that at the time he was writing, when Paul was writing Corinthians, there were still over 500 people alive who had seen the risen Lord.
[time=3234] If it be established men and women that Jesus Christ has come back from the grave and survived death and if that is true, and the Bible says that it is and history believes that it is and Christians know that it is, if that is true and since it is true, when Jesus Christ says, I am the resurrection and the life, he speaks with authority and he speaks with an invitation to all who will come to know him as the resurrection and life in their own experience.
[time=3263] Jesus said that he was the first fruits of them that slept because he came out of the grave.
[time=3269] He promises that all who will put their trust in him shall survive the grave to be with him forever.
[time=3275] And it is his desire that everyone who hears the message of his resurrection and comes to believe by faith that he is alive, come to a personal experience with him in a walk of relationship day by day to know him as their savior.
[time=3292] If Jesus Christ is alive, then someday you shall stand before him in judgment.
[time=3298] And when he says to you, what have you done with me?
[time=3301] You will have to give an answer.
[time=3303] There is no other person who has a claim on your life like he does.
[time=3307] He went to the cross for you.
[time=3310] He went to the grave for you and he came out of that tomb for you and he offers to you the opportunity to know him in a personal way.
[time=3318] If he should tear you until you die, if you do not know Jesus Christ, you will survive the grave, but not to be with God.
[time=3327] But if you put your trust in Christ and you die before Christ comes back, the Bible says that because he survived the grave, you will too.
[time=3339] And you will be resurrected to be with him forever.
[time=3344] Someone has said that if this is not true, another grave should be dug.
[time=3350] Not this time for a person, but for a faith.
[time=3354] And in that grave should be buried the Christian faith for without the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it is dead.
[time=3362] Shall we pray?
[time=3364] If you do not know Christ on this Easter Sunday,
[time=3371] you may know him.
[time=3373] Put your trust in him, ask him to come into your life.
[time=3376] Thank him for coming from the grave for you and accept his forgiveness for your sin.
[time=3380] Ask him into your life to be your savior.
[time=3384] Easter will never be the same if you know Christ and know that he lives within you.
[time=3390] Do it today, will you?
[time=3391] And our Father, we stand with hearts filled
[time=3399] with praise and thanksgiving.
[time=3403] That there is no place in the universe, in a museum.
