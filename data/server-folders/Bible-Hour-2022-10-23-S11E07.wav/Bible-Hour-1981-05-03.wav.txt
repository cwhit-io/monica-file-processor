[time=30] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=40] (audience applauding) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=53] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=59] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=76] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=84] - I wanna take this opportunity to welcome you to our service today, all of you gathering here for the second worship service at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=97] And especially now, all of you have joined us by way of television.
[time=100] They're in your own home, your place of business, where you may be staying in a motel, wherever.
[time=106] God has reached out to you today through this ministry and we're praying that it will be a real blessing and encouragement to your own life.
[time=114] One of the great truths of the Christian faith is the truth, that the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is payment in full for our sins.
[time=122] And one of the great old gospel songs is Jesus paid it all.
[time=127] Our choir has captured this in a very beautiful rendition of that old song and they sing it for us now.
[time=133] (gentle music)
[time=146] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=310] - We thank the choir for that ministry to our hearts in this great song.
[time=314] Last week, as we opened the Word of God together, we talked about the truth that Jesus Christ was the great shepherd.
[time=322] And there have been many, many songs that have been written that capture that theme, along with the many various versions of the 23rd Psalm.
[time=331] And one of the songs that is a great encouragement to every Christian at one time or another in his or her life is the truth.
[time=338] That in shady green pastures, he leads us along.
[time=343] He is our shepherd and we are his sheep.
[time=345] Pastor Krueger, our minister of music, is going to sing that another familiar gospel song for us as we listen today.
[time=352] (orchestral music)
[time=366] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=511] (soft music) - And Donna, it is a very special thing
[time=521] to be able to communicate personally with the people at home, just to ask our congregation to give us this privilege to be very specially involved with our friends who are part of the television ministry.
[time=532] I know that you have some things you wanna share with him in just a moment, but before you do that, I wanna let the folks at home know that the Bibles that we were a part of purchasing as a Bible hour project have arrived in Peru and our missionaries there, Dan and Judy Smith, have received the Bibles and they're so very grateful that they were able to get these Bibles to use with the people that they visit up and down the river in their boat ministry.
[time=559] And they've asked us to pass on to all of you who participated several months ago in helping us with that Bible project, that the project has been completed and they're using those Bibles now in ministering to the people that they touch, many of whom have never held a copy of the Bible in their hands.
[time=576] And so we wanna thank all of the Bible hour friends and those of you who are in the Founders Club, each and every one of you who helped us with that missionary project and Dan and Judy Smith from Aquitos, Peru send their thanksgiving to you as well.
[time=590] - We have been offering a little booklet called the Gospel of John for several weeks now and we're still getting a number of requests for it.
[time=597] So we thought we would show it to you a couple more times and give you an opportunity to call or write for it if you haven't already.
[time=604] It's an excellent little tool, especially for a new Christian.
[time=608] If you've recently accepted Christ as your savior and wanna get into the Word, or if you have a friend who has accepted the Lord, we would encourage you to write or call and ask for this little booklet called The Gospel of John.
[time=622] Different topics are highlighted in different colors.
[time=625] For instance, the green highlighting has to do with the forgiveness of sin which Christ offers us an eternal life.
[time=632] And so as a newborn Christian, if you want information on the forgiveness of your sins and what God has to say about eternal life, then the portions which are highlighted in green will give you that information.
[time=644] If you would like to have a free copy of this booklet, we would urge you to call us at our toll free number, 1-800-45-39000.
[time=653] - Or if you prefer, you may write to us and our mailing address is pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=663] - And I hope you listen to that information carefully, the telephone number and the address, because those are the places that you call or write if you want to enroll in our daily Bible study program.
[time=675] We have put together, I think, one of the finest Bible study programs in our country, a program called The Daily Walk.
[time=681] And it's specifically produced for those of you who are part of the Bible, our ministry.
[time=686] It's a program that gets you into the word of God every day of your life and makes it possible for you to read through the entire Bible in a year's time.
[time=694] We'd like to have the opportunity of getting you started by introducing you to the June Daily Walk program.
[time=701] And we have the opportunity to give you absolutely free the June edition of The Daily Walk.
[time=707] It comes in a beautiful little booklet like this, and in the booklet are the assignments for each day's reading, some applications to your own life, and an opportunity for you to reflect upon that passage and learn what the passage has to say and how it applies to your everyday experience.
[time=723] There are some review sections and a little check-off chart so that you can keep track of your daily reading.
[time=728] And then as you read through the Bible and send your reports into the Bible Hour Office, at the end of the year, we present a beautiful certificate to everyone who participates in the reading through the Bible program during that particular year.
[time=741] Now the beauty of The Daily Walk is that you can start reading anytime you want to, and if you stay in the program for a year, you will have read through the entire Bible.
[time=750] Many of you have had the opportunity to do that in past years, and well, you just like to have a chance to do it again.
[time=756] Some of you have never read this book, The Bible, the most important book that we have in our hands today.
[time=762] We'd like to help you get started, and we'll do that.
[time=764] If you'll just get in touch with us and we'll give you the telephone number and the address again in just a moment.
[time=770] But before we do that, we have a sponsor that we want to recognize.
[time=773] - We have two associate sponsors today, Donald and Nancy Johnston, who live in Rochester, Indiana, and watch the Bible Hour on WHMB.
[time=783] And we thank you, Johnston, for your part in the ministry today.
[time=787] - Donna, once again, the address and the telephone number.
[time=789] Why don't you share that with our friends so they'll know how to get in touch with us.
[time=793] - All right, our toll-free number is 1-800-4539,000.
[time=798] You dial that number, just ask for the Bible Hour operator and give them the message of the materials that you would like to receive.
[time=805] Our mailing address is post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=812] - Just before we go back to the service, I want to remind you that in a few moments, we're going to be looking at John chapter 14 in verse six.
[time=819] One of those verses that sometimes get Christians in trouble.
[time=822] It claims for Jesus Christ, in his own words, that he is the only way to God.
[time=830] I've had so many people ask me over the years, is it really true that you believe that Jesus Christ is the only true way to God?
[time=837] Well, let's examine that passage together, and I hope you'll have your Bible so we can look at it together in today's message.
[time=843] (upbeat music)
[time=852] (audience applauding) [MUSIC - 219 seconds]
[time=1080] - And do you know that in a few moments
[time=1086] we're going to be examining the truth from the word of God?
[time=1090] That Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=1094] Just before the message, we're going to listen to Al and of Peterson as they give us another invitation to try Jesus in our own lives, in our own experience.
[time=1105] The Peterson's.
[time=1107] (piano music) [MUSIC - 151 seconds]
[time=1264] I got the answer, I'll share with my friend. Why not try Jesus? Try Jesus today. Try Jesus today.
[time=1280] Try Jesus today.
[time=1305] Will you take your Bibles and let us turn together to John chapter 6?
[time=1309] John chapter, I'm sorry, John chapter 14 verses 1 through 6, John 14 1 through 6 and the Scripture
[time=1320] lesson is the context of the passage which is next in our series of the great I Am's of
[time=1328] John's Gospel. I'd like for us to stand together as we read in unison John 14 1 to 6. Everyone's
[time=1336] standing please. Let us read aloud. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God.
[time=1346] Believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would
[time=1354] have told you. I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you,
[time=1364] I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and where
[time=1374] I go ye know and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not where thou goest
[time=1385] and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=1394] No man come unto the Father but by me. Let us pray together.
[time=1403] Our Father in heaven, one of the things for which we are most grateful, is the absolute
[time=1410] nature of the revelation of God to man in the written word. And we are confident as we
[time=1417] hold this book in our hands that we have God's word to us, that it comes to us without mixture
[time=1425] of air, that it comes with the authoritative stamp of the Almighty God having been preserved
[time=1432] by the Holy Spirit in that process which we know as inspiration. So that when we read
[time=1438] its truth and study its concepts and understand its message, we are dealing with heavenly
[time=1446] things, God speaking to his creation. And Father, if that were to be in our minds more
[time=1454] indelibly imprinted than it is, we would take so much more care with the word of God than we do. Forgive us for handling it lightly so many times in our own lives as if it were
[time=1466] just another book. Help us to reverence it. Lord and to study it and to handle it carefully
[time=1475] and Lord give to us a deep desire to know what it says even in this moment of study together.
[time=1482] May the characteristic that is true of all of us during these moments of this message
[time=1488] be that we have come as a hungry and thirsty people to hear what Almighty God would say
[time=1494] to us from his written word. And we thank you Father for what you are going to do for us
[time=1500] and through us in Jesus' name. Amen. One of the seven most often asked questions
[time=1512] of the unbeliever or by the unbeliever of the Christian is this. Is Jesus really the
[time=1519] only way to God? Is he not just one of many ways? Is the Christian quote unquote religion
[time=1529] really the only true way to know God? I suppose in the years of my ministry I have been asked
[time=1535] that question hundreds of times. How do you know that what the Bible teaches about Jesus
[time=1541] Christ is really the only way? What about this leader and that leader and they go around
[time=1548] the world mentioning all of the great quote unquote religious leaders. Sometimes when
[time=1554] that question is asked depending upon the person who asks it one gets the impression
[time=1560] that it is within man's province to determine whether or not Jesus Christ is the only way
[time=1567] to God. For us to say that he is the exclusive way to the Heavenly Father is that not sort
[time=1576] of like a bigotry of some of some nature sort of like our saying that we're the only ones
[time=1582] who are right. Is that really the way that we want to communicate our faith? And yet as
[time=1589] you open the pages of this book it is so very clear that that's exactly what Christ claimed
[time=1595] for himself. He claimed to be the exclusive way that man comes to the Father. Sometimes
[time=1602] I think we confuse the way God operates with the way man operates. In our society today
[time=1610] we have certain laws that we have generated to protect ourselves. For instance by some
[time=1616] sort of consensus we have decided that it is important to have a stop sign at certain intersections and that if we go through that stop sign we have violated the law which has been brought together by the consensus of the community. Sometimes I think we feel in our
[time=1631] own minds that God operates that very way. That people get together and by synthesis and by consensus they decide what it is that you should believe about God. But you see it
[time=1643] doesn't work that way. God has revealed to us how we are to relate to him and we have no option to deal with that truth according to our own desires. For instance we could
[time=1655] propose a motion in this congregation this morning. I could recommend it and have someone second it and the motion would be that tomorrow morning between 8 and 9 o'clock we will suspend
[time=1666] for one hour the law of gravity and I could say all in favor raise your hand and we might all vote for that truth. But the fact of the matter is if having voted on that truth we would all go down to the Lincoln Bank and jump out of the 15th story window they would
[time=1682] pick all of us up with a shovel. It doesn't make any difference whether we have voted on it or not. The truth is God has legislated a law and that law cannot be violated and
[time=1692] so it is as we try to relate to the Father Jesus is the only way according to the Scripture.
[time=1698] Now we may not like that we may determine we don't want to believe it but we must understand that we cannot make something untrue just because we choose not to accept it is truth.
[time=1710] Jesus in the greatest statement concerning the exclusive nature of salvation communicates
[time=1716] to us very clearly that he is the way to God. Now this communication is set in a very interesting
[time=1723] setting. Jesus is beginning the upper room discourse which runs from John 14 through 17.
[time=1732] It is the night before his death Judas is gone he has gathered his 11 disciples now together
[time=1738] for his last address to them. He has coming before them to comfort their hurting hearts
[time=1745] for these disciples have loved and worked and walked with the Lord and they are facing now the eminent separation from their leader. Someone has said that John 14 has had more
[time=1757] tears spilled on its pages than any other chapter in the Bible for it is one of the great chapters of comfort. It speaks to us of how God has cared for us in the hour of
[time=1768] separation just as the disciples were soon to be separated from the Lord oftentimes we are separated from our loved ones and it is to this chapter that we turn in the hour of death. Martin Luther commenting on the 14th chapter of John said it is the best and
[time=1785] most comforting sermon that the Lord Christ ever preached while he was on this earth and
[time=1791] a jewel that is not to be purchased with this world's goods. Jesus is comforting his troubled
[time=1798] disciples now keep that in mind they were troubled first of all they were sad because
[time=1804] of Christ's departure they were ashamed because as they looked at their own lives they realized how they had failed the Lord and their selfishness and pride was so paramount in their thinking
[time=1815] they were perplexed because Jesus had predicted that one of their number was going to betray
[time=1821] him and they were looking around wondering how which one it is that is going to do this they were wavering in their faith because this Jesus whom they had followed was to be their Messiah and how could he be their Messiah if one of the disciples that he had drawn unto
[time=1836] himself wasn't even going to be true to him. When Jesus reached out to these hurting agonizing
[time=1844] disciples he did so in order to encourage and help and comfort them and before we look at
[time=1850] what he said let me just share with you something that became very meaningful to me this week
[time=1856] it is interesting to me as I see our Lord in this passage of scripture reaching out to
[time=1862] his disciples to understand that he was reaching out to them from a heart that was already filled
[time=1868] with agony and hurt himself. For if you will look back in your Bibles to the thirteenth
[time=1875] chapter and the twenty first verse you will see that Jesus Christ is himself a troubled
[time=1882] man at this time when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and
[time=1888] said very very I say unto you that one of you shall betray me. Here is a beautiful picture
[time=1895] to all of us in the Christian ministry of the agonizing shepherd facing the cross and yet
[time=1902] reaching out to others it is interesting that even as he hung on the cross in some of the last moments of his earthly life he looked down to say a word of comfort and cheer to
[time=1913] his mother that's the way our Lord is that's the way he was that's the way he is today no
[time=1919] matter how much he may have hurt himself he found time to reach out to those around him who were hurting and so when Jesus reached out to these eleven from his own troubled
[time=1930] spirit he gave to them in these first few verses of John 14 some great and comforting
[time=1936] truths he used basically three things to comfort their hearts first of all he told them about
[time=1944] his own deity he said you believe in God well believe in me for I am God if you believe
[time=1950] in God then just believe in me and of course he counted on the Jewish faith in the Old Testament Jehovah and he is claiming to be equal with that God and he is saying to these hurting disciples you believe in God believe in me for we are one secondly he shares with them
[time=1966] the truth about a place that he is preparing for them he says I'm going to prepare a place for you yes we're going to be separated but it is only in order that I might provide something special for you in the future and so he shares with them the nature of his preparation and the place where he goes and the third thing that he shares with them is the news of his return he says to them as I go away to prepare a place for you there's coming a day when
[time=1993] I will come again and receive you unto myself and there we shall be forever together and
[time=1999] it is those words and it is that truth that has comfort the hearts of so many Christians in the hour of sorrow and difficulty and separation that Jesus Christ is up there preparing a
[time=2009] place for us and someday he will come again to receive us unto himself now when Jesus shared that truth of his disciples we should not be surprised that Thomas the doubter misunderstood
[time=2020] the whole thing Thomas said Lord you tell us that we're going to come and be with you Lord
[time=2028] we don't even know where you're going how are we going to know the way and as you read the setting you realize immediately that Thomas has taken that which the Lord communicated in the spiritual realm and because he was living on such a low level himself he put it down in the physical realm and he thought the Lord Jesus was talking about going some place outside of Palestine probably building a great retreat center and inviting all of his friends to come and live with him in that retreat center and there they would have a joyous time and he said Lord we don't know where you're going we don't know if it's Galilee
[time=2060] pariah Jordan we don't know where you're heading Lord and if we don't know where you're going how in the world are we going to know how to get there and it's interesting to me that it was in response to one of the greatest statements of doubt that our Lord made one
[time=2075] of the greatest statements of faith he said to Thomas and to the eleven and to all of us
[time=2083] he said Thomas you say you don't know where I'm going and you don't know the way listen
[time=2089] I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the Father but by me in order
[time=2099] to set this in its proper setting in order to understand what the Lord was really saying we have to go back from John chapter 14 all the way back to the book of Genesis before
[time=2113] Adam's sinned way back in the first two chapters before Adam sinned Adam enjoyed three special
[time=2120] privileges with God the first one was the privilege of communion with his God you remember
[time=2126] how the the Old Testament teaches us that he walked and he talked with God and he fellowshiped with God and there was beautiful and wonderful fellowship between the maker of Adam and Adam
[time=2137] the creature not only did he know fellowship with God but he had intimate knowledge of God he knew God as we know each other it was not through a veil darkly but it was intimate
[time=2148] knowledge of of God in heaven as much as a creature can know of his creator there were no barriers of that knowledge he knew God not only did he fellowship with God and know
[time=2158] God but he had within himself life in fact had Adam not sinned we all understand this
[time=2164] from theology he would never have died he would have lived on and on forever for he had within himself the life of the one who had created him he had fellowship with God he had knowledge of God and he had the life of God but Adam sinned and everything that God gave him and
[time=2180] those special privileges was ruined we see him now not walking and talking with God in
[time=2187] the garden but we see him hiding for fear of God for his fellowship with the father has
[time=2193] been broken he has chosen not to believe God but to believe the deceitful lie of Satan
[time=2199] and so his knowledge of God is clouded he no longer can discern between what God has said and what Satan has said and his knowledge is no longer perfect his knowledge is lost he
[time=2211] has lost fellowship he has lost knowledge and the prophecy which God made to him before he sinned came true for God said in the day that thou eatest there of thou shalt what
[time=2224] surely die and the moment that Adam sinned death set into his being so that he died physically
[time=2233] but the seeds of spiritual death were also there for the wages of sin is death and every
[time=2241] single child of Adam who has been born into this world from Genesis chapter three until this present day has been born into our world with those three problems unresolved we don't
[time=2254] fellowship with God we don't have any fellowship with God we don't know God perfectly as we ought to know him and we have been born to die and there is no way that those three problems
[time=2267] can be recovered until we come to understand the person of Jesus Christ and in John chapter
[time=2274] 14 and verse 6 we have the three great problems of man found perfectly answered in the perfect
[time=2282] Savior the Lord Jesus Christ for he is communion and fellowship with God restored I am the way
[time=2291] speaking of access to God he is the knowledge that was lost in the garden recovered I am
[time=2298] the truth and he is death restored to life I am the life in Jesus Christ we find recovered
[time=2308] what Adam lost and so it is only as we come to Jesus Christ as human creatures having inherited
[time=2315] the old Adamic nature that we can get back in our lives what Adam lost when he sinned
[time=2324] and it is to that which we address our attention this morning in theology if I can digress
[time=2331] for just a moment there are three great truths which have theological terms which are found
[time=2337] here in this verse as it relates to the Old Testament for instance the doctrine of fellowship
[time=2343] and communion and the restored relationship with the Father is what we call reconciliation
[time=2349] the doctrine of reconciliation to be reconciled with God the doctrine of a renewed understanding
[time=2356] of God and the truth about God is what we call the doctrine of illumination and the doctrine
[time=2362] of life as a principle and as a force being given to us in the spiritual rebirth process
[time=2369] is what we call regeneration so in this one verse of scripture we have three great doctrines
[time=2376] of the faith we have the doctrine of regeneration that is life we have the doctrine of illumination
[time=2383] that is truth and we have the doctrine of reconciliation he is the way between God and man let me say
[time=2390] again Jesus Christ recovers for us what Adam lost now let's look at those three things
[time=2396] one at a time first of all Jesus Christ is our reconciliation I am the way Jesus said
[time=2405] that he was the way to God he was the link between man and God in the New Testament he
[time=2414] had claimed to be the teacher of the way in mark chapter 12 and verse 14 we are told
[time=2420] in Luke 1 verse 79 that he guides us into the way and over in Hebrews chapter 10 in
[time=2427] verse 20 we are told that Jesus Christ came into this world to provide a new and living way into the holy of holies into the presence of God but more than all of these things men
[time=2438] and women Jesus Christ is much more he is not just the teacher of the way the guide into
[time=2445] the way the bringer of a new and living way the Bible says that he himself is the way
[time=2452] maybe an illustration will help when I travel someplace to preach or go to to make a speech
[time=2458] someplace and I drive immediately before I leave I know I'm in trouble because my sense
[time=2464] of direction is so terrible and I spend a lot of time lost I go into a strange town and
[time=2471] I have a general idea of where I'm heading and so the first thing I do is I stop at a gas station and I ask for some instructions and usually it's go down here to the second light and turn left and go down to the dead end and turn right and then go back up and by the time they get through I'm more confused than ever so I go as far as I can and then I find another gas station and little by little I finally get to my destination there was a
[time=2494] time in my life when I was headed out to preach and I went into a strange town I didn't know where I was going and I stopped in the gas station and I said I'm looking for such and such a place and there was a man sitting in a car getting gas in his car and he leaned out the window and he said listen if you'll follow me I'll take you there I'll tell you
[time=2513] what it's nice to have a teacher of the way it's nice to have a guide in the way it's nice to have a provider of the way but the best thing that ever happened to me when I was lost was when someone became the way and took me from where I was to where I needed to go
[time=2528] and Jesus said I'm not just the teacher of the way I'm not just the guide into the way
[time=2534] I'm not just the provider of a new and living way I am the way to God and if you want to
[time=2540] get to God you have to come with me through me by me into the presence of the holy holy
[time=2548] God now how is he the way well first of all he is the way from God to man over in Matthew
[time=2556] chapter 11 in verse 27 Jesus said no man knoweth the father now listen to this no man knoweth
[time=2563] the father but the ones to whom the son reveals him how do you know the father Jesus Christ
[time=2570] is the revelation of the father to man he is God's message to man in the book of Hebrews were told that in times past in another generation in a dispensation past God revealed himself
[time=2582] unto us by the prophets but now in these last days God has revealed himself unto us through
[time=2588] his son the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is the revelation of God to man if you have seen
[time=2595] me he said you have seen the father so he is the way from God to man but you see the emphasis of this passage is that he is the way from man to God I am the way he said now
[time=2607] what does he mean well ever since the beginning of time man has tried to figure out a way
[time=2614] to God all by himself that's what the Tower of Babel was all about you know men have constructed
[time=2620] ladders of access to God and they have tried to climb up by way of resolutions and reformations
[time=2626] and prayers and tears and they have thought that if they can just put together enough good works they can get up to God and they have the nagging feeling in their own heart
[time=2636] as I have talked to many of them the feeling of trying as hard as they can but failing and obviously they are failing because there is no way to climb up to God by means of our
[time=2647] own efforts I am convinced that Satan tries to keep people on the road of self reclamation
[time=2653] as long as he can for as long as they are on that road they will never understand that God has provided an alternative the Proverbs say there is a way a way to God which seem
[time=2666] with right unto a man what is that way climb up by your own works but the end there of
[time=2672] are the ways of death you can't get to God by what you do Jesus said he is the only way
[time=2679] Christ is the link between you and God and if you try to climb up by some other way you will never make it the only way to God is through Jesus Christ you see he is fellowship
[time=2690] and communion restored and when you come to the Father you have got to come up through Christ he is the only way but Jesus in this passage of scripture also claimed to be the
[time=2702] truth what does he mean well back in the first chapter of John we read about the truth do
[time=2709] you remember what it said in John 1 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[time=2715] we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father and what is the rest of it full of grace and truth and then in John chapter 1 verse 17 we read the law came
[time=2727] by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ Jesus said that he was the way into
[time=2736] the truth and that's certainly that's certainly a part of the revelation of the New Testament he tells us that we can only know the truth through him that Christ is the final revelation of God but he is more than just the declaration of the truth the Bible says that he is the
[time=2754] truth have you ever noticed that in the New Testament Christ is the embodiment of all of his characteristics the Bible says God is love God is light God is truth what does
[time=2767] that mean that means you take everything you can conceive of in terms of the nature of that term and all that you can think of Jesus Christ is the epitome of it he is the embodiment
[time=2778] of it he is everything there is that is opposed to deceit and air and lie he is the truth personified
[time=2788] ever since Adam believed the devil's lie ever since he accepted what Satan said instead
[time=2796] of believing what God said men have groped in the darkness and ignorance of air did you
[time=2804] know that in Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 19 we read this interesting verse the way of
[time=2810] the wicked is darkness and they know not at what they stumble that's the way it is with
[time=2818] people apart from God it's darkness they don't even know what they stumble over they're in ignorance and blindness in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 18 we're told that a person outside
[time=2828] of Christ has his understanding darkened he is alienated from the life of God how through
[time=2834] the ignorance that is in him because of the blindness of his heart ever since Adam's sin
[time=2841] scales came over the eyes of mankind so that they could not see the truth about God through
[time=2847] their own abolition through their own desire and Jesus Christ has come to remove those scales
[time=2854] and to be the truth as opposed to air the rightness as opposed to the wrongness and to
[time=2860] show them the revelation of himself as the embodiment of the truth about God and I want to say to you that truth is not a system it is not a philosophy but truth is a person
[time=2872] and that's why Paul wrote to the Colossians and said that in Jesus Christ you find all
[time=2878] of the truth of the treasures and the wisdom and the knowledge of God embodied in him Jesus
[time=2884] Christ was truth walking around in a body he said I am the way the truth and finally not
[time=2893] only is he illumination because he has recovered the truth about God but he is also regeneration
[time=2903] he is the life of God he said I am the truth the way I am the life now there are three or
[time=2915] four words in the New Testament that are used by the writers of the New Testament language
[time=2921] and sometimes are translated by the term life for instance there is the word newma we usually say newma means spirit sometimes that word is translated by the word life it is the idea
[time=2931] that within your body is the inanimate thing which is the principle of life the newma and sometimes we use the word suke for the word life it is the word most ordinarily translated
[time=2942] by the word soul your soul is your life sometimes the word bios is used in the Greek language
[time=2950] and is translated by the word life and I don't have to explain that we get our word biology from that it means the outward manifestation of life but here in this passage Jesus does
[time=2960] not say he is the newma the suke or the bios he is the zoe the life as opposed to death
[time=2967] he is life as opposed to what we have without him for the opposite of zoe is death separation
[time=2974] from God separation from the body Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life the principle
[time=2981] of life is within him that means that he is everything that you think of when you think
[time=2987] of life and the book of John is filled with expressions that Jesus used to describe how
[time=2994] he is related to the principle of life for instance in John 812 he talks about himself as being the light of life in John 668 he talks about communicating the words of life in John
[time=3008] 10 verse 10 he says I am calm that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly
[time=3014] in John 17 3 he speaks of life eternal which is knowing God and Jesus Christ whom he have
[time=3020] sinned what Jesus is saying is this just as Adam lost life when he sinned in the garden
[time=3028] Jesus Christ has come into this world to restore that life so that we do not have to die but
[time=3034] can live on beyond the grave Jesus Christ is the emancipator from death man is spiritually
[time=3043] lifeless he is dead someone has said the problem with man apart from Christ is that the center
[time=3049] and circumference of his life is self and if there's anything more dead than that I've
[time=3055] never seen it in the New Testament we have the story of the prodigal son who went off
[time=3063] down into the wickedness of the big city away from his father and he squandered his
[time=3070] goods there in that place of sin one day he came to himself and he came home and you
[time=3076] know the story it's in Luke 15 and he finally comes home and his father makes this statement it's very interesting he said this my son was dead but now he is alive you say pastor did
[time=3092] the prodigal son die and have a resurrection no did he die physically no did he quit breathing
[time=3098] did he quit moving did they put him in the grave no but his father said he was dead how
[time=3104] was he dead living down there in the far country he was dead everything that was going on in the father's house do you see it he was dead to his father he was dead to all of the riches
[time=3115] of his father's house he was dead to all the privileges of his father's house he was dead to everything that was happening in his father's house still breathing still living alive to the world but dead to his father the prodigal son pictures every single man and woman apart
[time=3131] from Christ oh they're alive you say that's really living they're living down here in the world alive to everything that goes on around them but the father's house up here is a dead
[time=3142] issue they don't know anything about God they don't anything about Christ they don't anything about what it means to have eternal life and fellowship with the almighty God they're alive in the sense that they are moving around in this world but they are dead in the sense that they know nothing about God and Jesus Christ came into this world to change that
[time=3161] picture he came into the world in order that he might come to live within that person apart from God and bring to him the knowledge of the father and bring life into him so that
[time=3173] he could be alive to God and he could know God and that's why in the New Testament we
[time=3179] are told that if we believe in Christ we have passed from death into life he that hath the
[time=3189] son what does he have he has life for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten
[time=3195] son that whosoever believe in him should not perish but have what everlasting life sometimes
[time=3201] people get the idea that everlasting life is what happens after you die oh you miss it all everlasting life is what happens the moment you believe all of a sudden you become
[time=3212] alive to God and you understand the father's house and you understand the fellowship with the father you're no longer dead to that anymore you're automatically turned on and turned into God and understand what he's all about and Jesus said I am the way reconciliation
[time=3235] I am the truth illumination I am the life regeneration and you say pastor is it possible
[time=3244] that there's some other way beside this maybe maybe there's some other thing we have no just
[time=3250] in case there's any misgivings about this what does he say at the end of the verse I am the way the truth and the life notice he does not use I am a way a truth and a life
[time=3262] he uses the definitive pronoun I am the way the truth and the life and then as if there
[time=3269] were any doubt no man come with unto the father but by me that's pretty plain isn't it you
[time=3280] say that's narrow well if I'm going to be narrow folks I want to be just as narrow and no more than the word of God the word of God says you can't get to the father but through
[time=3292] Christ there's no man who will ever stand before God in heaven and claim to have gotten there
[time=3298] apart from Jesus Christ men and women you cannot get to heaven apart from Christ and
[time=3305] that's not just this passage acts for twelve says neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved first Corinthians
[time=3316] three eleven says other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid which is Christ Jesus first Timothy says for there is one God and one mediator between God and man and
[time=3327] that one is Jesus Christ and if you're going to try to get to heaven some other way you're going to fail you can't get to God except through Jesus Christ he said I am the way the
[time=3341] truth and the life the three things that this humanity lost in Adam have been recovered
[time=3349] in Christ and provided for us access to the father the reason it's true is because without
[time=3358] Christ there is no redemptive truth without Christ there is no everlasting life so without
[time=3367] Christ there's no way to the father have you been trying to climb up some other way it is
[time=3373] a fruitless endless exasperating and defeating experience shall we pray Jesus Christ holds
[time=3386] out to each and every one of you the opportunity of fellowship with the father right now those
[time=3392] of you who are watching by television can simply bow your head and say God I accept what Jesus Christ did for me on the cross I receive him as my Savior I ask him to be my mediator between
[time=3405] God and man and be my Savior ask him to come into your life and into your heart and he
[time=3411] will and you can no fellowship lost in Adam you can no truth that needs to be recovered
[time=3419] and you can have eternal life now and forever more and our father it is that which we pray
