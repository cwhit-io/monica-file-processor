[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Gerema.
[time=48] (Music)
[time=77] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=83] And we welcome all of you to this service today. This is Mother's Day at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=90] I always have to put a disclaimer on that when I say that in this service because some of you are watching this service on a two weeks delayed basis in other places in the Midwest.
[time=101] But we are going to celebrate Mother's Day, whether it's Mother's Day in your area or not, and it will be good for you to think about it again, even so quickly after many of you have thought of it already.
[time=113] We have some music that I know will be an encouragement to your heart. We're going to be hearing from Starr Narwhal and Keith Brodigan.
[time=120] Just a few moments we'll be listening to Stephen Maria Gardner, but right now we're going to listen to our choir as they sing for us a song entitled, "Jesus is All the World to Me."
[time=131] (Music)
[time=189] "Jesus is All the World to Me."
[time=214] (Music)
[time=347] One of the great assets of being a Christian is the friendship that you have with the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our Savior first, but he doesn't end his ministry to us the moment we believe. He is our friend and he is the friend who sticketh closer than a brother.
[time=370] In the New Testament, there is a story of a man who described his relationship with the Lord in these terms. He said, "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief. I am sure that there have been times when we have felt that emotion, that we believe, and yet in our belief there is doubt."
[time=391] I think that Star Narwhal is captured, that thought in the song she's going to sing, "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief."
[time=401] (Music)
[time=430] I believe, help thou mine unbelief. I walk into the unknown, trusting all the wild. I long so much to feel the wars that others have.
[time=459] That others seem to know. Should I never feel a thing? I claim him, even so. I believe, help thou mine unbelief.
[time=486] I take the finite risk of trusting as a child. I long so much to feel the wars that others seem to know.
[time=512] Should I never feel a thing? I claim him, even so. I believe, help thou mine unbelief. I take the finite risk of trusting as a child.
[time=541] I take the finite risk of trusting all the wild.
[time=566] Thank you for being with us today. We appreciate so much that you take time out of your schedule to share in the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=580] Don, it is a real special opportunity that we have to talk with our friends at home, just like we were entertaining them in our own home in this informal time together.
[time=589] One of the reasons we do this is to share with them the opportunity for extended Bible study and opportunity for literature that we like to provide for them.
[time=599] We are going back to something that has been a very popular requested item, and I want you to tell them a little bit about it.
[time=606] Many of you are familiar with the answer book, but for those of you who are not, it is a collection of Bible verses in topical order.
[time=615] If you are like me and you sometimes find it difficult to think right off the top of your head of references, especially if someone calls you on the phone and is in need of perhaps comfort and you need just the right verse, but can't recall it.
[time=629] If you have this little booklet handy, you just pick it up and turn to that section and it gives you the scripture references that deal with that topic.
[time=637] It is really a handy little tool to have.
[time=639] One of the sections in the book is a section on praise, and that is a very helpful thing because the Bible teaches us that praise is one of God's therapeutic means of helping his people.
[time=652] When we praise him, it helps to relieve the insecurities that we have about ourselves because we focus our attention on an almighty God instead of a fallible human being.
[time=663] There is a section in here on the subject of praise. Much of it comes from the Psalms.
[time=668] It is simply an opportunity to talk to God and thank him for what he is.
[time=672] Places in the Psalms like Psalm 34-1, "I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth."
[time=681] It is interesting for me to note that the Bible says that God inhabits the praise of his people.
[time=686] That means he actually lives within the sanctuary of the praise that we offer up.
[time=691] This booklet has a section in it on praise that will help you in your own prayer life as you try to praise God and share with him the joy of your own heart in response to what he has done for you.
[time=703] The booklet is very easy for you to receive if you will just listen to Donna's instruction in ordering it by phone or through the mail.
[time=711] We have a toll-free number which you may call at any time. That number is 1-800-453-9000. Just ask for the Bible our operator and tell her that you would like the booklet called the answer book.
[time=724] And we'll be happy to send it off to you right away.
[time=727] Or if you prefer, you may write to us. Our mailing address is pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46-815.
[time=738] And we always love to hear from you in the mail.
[time=740] Donna, before we go back to the service, I want to share with our friends at home that we have a very special couple who are underwriting today.
[time=748] One of the telecasts in the Springfield Dayton area, I believe it's channel 26 there.
[time=754] And those folks are friends of ours, members of this church who formerly lived in the Dayton Springfield area in Springfield, Ohio.
[time=761] Mr. Bill Edson, who was associated with the international harvester plant there in Springfield and is now here in Fort Wayne.
[time=768] Bill and Dorothy are sponsoring the program today on the Springfield Dayton station.
[time=773] And we want to thank them for being a full sponsor, making sure that the program gets out over the year today in that area.
[time=780] If you'd like information about the sponsorship program, all you have to do is request it when you write.
[time=785] We'll be happy to share with you what you can do to be of help to us in that respect.
[time=789] Once again, before we go back to our service this morning, Donna, give them the information as to how they write for the answer book, how they call for the answer book if they'd like to get in touch with us.
[time=798] Okay, that mailing address is Post Office Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=805] And our toll-free number is 1-800-453-9000.
[time=811] You do let us hear from you this week.
[time=813] Thank you so much for being with us, and please stay with us now as in a few moments we open the Word of God for a special message to mothers.
[time=821] It's Mother's Day here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and though it may be a bit delayed for some of you on the television network,
[time=827] I know that what we have to share today from the New Testament will be an encouragement to you and a challenge to your own life.
[time=833] So we hope you'll be with us for these next few moments.
[time=843] [MUSIC]
[time=859] I walk at night beneath a majestic skies, and know behind it is a god of light.
[time=874] We fix those storms each in their lonely place.
[time=882] We'll wrap them in a dark and low of space.
[time=890] Oh, Lord, my God, how wonderful the Lord, to make the world a satisfactory heart.
[time=905] I've failed to come, re-hand it all some way.
[time=913] Oh, mighty God, how wonderful the Lord.
[time=923] [MUSIC]
[time=931] I scan the heavens with virtue in my soul, and wonder how the God who made the whole could ever fix his thoughts on such as me.
[time=955] We'll give his son to die upon the tree.
[time=965] Oh, mighty God, how wonderful the world, to make the world a satisfactory heart.
[time=980] I've failed to come, re-hand it all some way.
[time=987] Oh, mighty God, how wonderful the world, to make the world a satisfactory heart.
[time=1016] [MUSIC]
[time=1021] Thank you, Keith. That honors the Lord, does it not? And glorifies his name.
[time=1026] It's like singing how great thou art twice in one service, and we appreciate it so very much.
[time=1032] I want to ask all of the mothers in the service today, if you would stand up please.
[time=1039] Would you do that everywhere? Just stand right up.
[time=1044] And first of all, before we pray, I want to thank you for being here and to wish each and every one of you a blessed and wonderful day as you reflect upon what you have because of what God has entrusted to you.
[time=1058] And I would just like to have the privilege to pray specifically for you, so let's bow together in prayer, shall we?
[time=1064] Our God in heaven, how thankful we are for the high and holy calling of motherhood.
[time=1072] And as these who have gathered here in this worship service this morning are standing, we are reminded in our own hearts of the blessings which we have because of that which you have entrusted to the mothers in this congregation.
[time=1089] I think of the mother who taught me to know God and who influenced my own life, and I just give you praise for my mother.
[time=1099] And I realize, dear God, that the woman you have given to me as a wife is what she is in a large measure because of the influence that her mother had in her life, and I thank you for Donna's mother.
[time=1112] And I thank you for all of these mothers who are standing here today, for the children you have entrusted to them, and for the blessing you have poured out upon them.
[time=1122] And I just want to have the opportunity, God, to dedicate anew to these who have such a tremendous opportunity that you have entrusted to them.
[time=1132] Use them and bless them and guide them, and, dear God, make this to be a day that is special above all days as they rejoice in their families and in their God, for I pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1147] You may be seated.
[time=1150] And just before the message, our own Stephen Maria Gardner are going to sing a song that is a favorite of many, many mothers that I know.
[time=1160] It's a favorite gospel hymn in the garden. I know you'll enjoy it.
[time=1190] And the voice I hear falling on my ear, the son of God discloses, and he walks with me, and he talks with me.
[time=1219] And he tells me I am his own.
[time=1227] And the joy we share as we carry them, none other has ever known.
[time=1249] And the sound of his voice is so sweet, the birds harsh their singing, and the melody that he gave to me.
[time=1275] Within my heart is ringing, and he walks with me, and he talks with me.
[time=1293] And he tells me I am his own, and the joy we share as we carry them, none other has ever known.
[time=1320] None other has ever known.
[time=1344] Thank you, gardeners, for that song. And now let's open our Bibles together, shall we?
[time=1351] Our Mother's Day message comes from the first book of Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[time=1360] And we are going to read together verses 8 through 15, 1 Timothy chapter 2 verses 8 through 15.
[time=1369] You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine, reading from the Word of God, 1 Timothy chapter 2 verses 8 through 15.
[time=1378] I will, therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.
[time=1386] In like manner also that women adorned themselves in modest apparel with godly fear and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array,
[time=1397] but which become with women professing godliness with good works?
[time=1401] Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection, but I permit not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
[time=1410] For Adam was first formed, then Eve, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression,
[time=1418] not withstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.
[time=1428] Shall we pray together?
[time=1431] Our Father in Heaven, we ask that you will take these moments that we have dedicated to the study of Thy Word,
[time=1438] and that you will use them to sanctify and instruct our hearts and our lives,
[time=1445] and cause that we shall have a real hunger to know God's truth.
[time=1450] We live in the midst of a wicked and perverse generation, and we are to shine as lights,
[time=1456] and to be an example, an outpouring of God's love and His light into our world.
[time=1461] We realize that if we are to do that, we must be vessels that are fit unto the Master's use,
[time=1467] that God is interested not so much in what we do, but in what we are.
[time=1472] And I pray that today as we discuss God's mandate, mothers,
[time=1478] that you will give us an openness to hear what God would say.
[time=1481] Some of it may not be easy for us to take.
[time=1485] Some of it seems to run against all that we hear around us, but Lord, we want to hear from Heaven.
[time=1491] We realize that if we try to live our lives on this earth in earthly ways, we will fail at the very core of our lives as Christians.
[time=1500] So we ask that you will give us a heavenly perspective on this subject, which is before us. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1510] Back in the early 1900s, Anna M. Jarvis conceived of the idea of setting aside one day
[time=1518] on which to pay homage to mothers.
[time=1522] The idea was enthusiastically received as Mrs. Jarvis talked about it, and when her own mother died on the second Sunday of May 1905,
[time=1534] she set aside that day in her own life as a day to honor her mother.
[time=1540] Woodrow Wilson was president during those days, and he brought the suggestion of Anna Jarvis to the Congress, and an act of Congress in 1914 set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day,
[time=1553] and it has been observed such ever since.
[time=1557] Mrs. Jarvis said that on this day we should live as our mothers would have us live,
[time=1563] and she suggested that each person spend the day with his mother
[time=1570] and try to express to her in the best way possible his love, and if it were impossible to spend the day he was to write a letter to express that love,
[time=1580] and many of you I'm sure have already done that, and I see some of you here today with your mothers who have come from other parts of the country to be with you on this day.
[time=1590] I think it's great that we have a day to honor and dignify the high and holy calling of motherhood,
[time=1599] and yet I wonder if we examine our culture, if the observance of Mother's Day will become,
[time=1606] in the years ahead, a simple ritual that we pass through on the calendar because it's always been there.
[time=1614] For if I understand our culture in any way, I believe that motherhood is perceived of
[time=1621] as a much lower calling than perhaps ever before in the history and culture of our country.
[time=1627] That's why I've chosen today to speak to all of you who are mothers on this subject,
[time=1633] God's mandate to mothers.
[time=1636] I don't pretend that you will all like what I have to say.
[time=1640] It has been quite evident to me that as you teach what the Word of God says in today's culture,
[time=1646] you sound as if a prophet from a different generation, and some of you will say that this truth is not for today, it was for the day in which it was written, but I say to you this is God's Word, and what He says to us is for our day in our culture, 1981,
[time=1664] and we will study it together as we open its truth.
[time=1667] Now the verse of Scripture that we're going to examine is the most controversial one.
[time=1672] It is the 15th verse, and it says this, "Not withstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing."
[time=1681] If you have as many commentaries on 1 Timothy as I do, and if you had pulled them all down off the shelf and examined them, you would find that there is a great deal of disagreement about what this passage really means.
[time=1692] For instance, there are some who say that a woman who was saved in childbearing, that that phrase means that she has promised safety during childbirth, and yet the record is clear from Rachel right on down to today, that there have been godly women who have died in childbirth, and so it obviously doesn't have anything to do with that.
[time=1714] Another man writes that this means that a woman who dies in childbirth shall be saved,
[time=1720] as if one could be saved in any other way except by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone apart from works.
[time=1727] That concept of this passage of Scripture not only denies the doctrine of salvation, but it ignores the context which talks about this mother bringing her children along in love and faith and sobriety and holiness.
[time=1741] If she dies in childbirth, then obviously she has no other ministry beyond that point in time.
[time=1748] Someone has written that the passage means that the mother will be saved through a child who will be born, a reference to Jesus Christ, but as you examine the context, you see that that is simply the interpretation that we give to the passage based upon what we already know, that Jesus Christ came as a child.
[time=1769] If you read the text and you read the context and you understand what Paul is saying, you come to this understanding.
[time=1776] I suppose there's not any passage in all the word of God that is harder on women in the church than this one,
[time=1783] and whenever a pastor realizes he is coming to 1 Timothy chapter 2, he drinks a few extra cups of coffee in the morning before he gives the message and he steals himself for the response he's bound to get, no matter what he says on the passage.
[time=1797] For the Scripture says that in the church the woman is not to usurp authority over man.
[time=1803] Now ladies, there are many things you can do in this church, and we glorify all of them and thank God for you, but I understand this passage to mean that God does not allow women preachers.
[time=1814] I don't believe in women preachers.
[time=1816] I don't think women ought to be ordained as preachers in the ministry.
[time=1819] Now there's a great deal of controversy over that in our day, but I think that's what the Scripture is talking about and that's what this passage says.
[time=1828] And as Paul goes down the line instructing young Timothy as the pastor of the church in Ephesus, he tells him how women are to function within the church, and he says they are not to usurp authority over men.
[time=1840] And so a woman reading this passage as she goes down through the verses, she finally gets to verse 15, and she's wondering, well, what is my calling then?
[time=1848] What am I supposed to do?
[time=1850] And I like the word not withstanding, that begins the 15th verse.
[time=1854] I think what Paul is saying is this, not withstanding, she shall find her place of happiness and her domain of influence
[time=1865] and her realm of opportunity and her joy of calling and her leadership responsibility within the realm of child rearing and childbearing.
[time=1875] Her domain of influence is within the home.
[time=1878] That does not mean she has no ministry in the church.
[time=1881] Thank God for all the women who minister in the church.
[time=1884] But what Paul is saying to us in this passage is this, as the man finds his realm of leadership within the role of the church, and it's explained in this book, there is nothing that is of a lower calling to the woman
[time=1897] who finds her realm of leadership and her role of opportunity within the home.
[time=1902] A woman is to function within the home as the highest and most holy calling
[time=1908] that God can give to anyone.
[time=1910] This not only takes the context into consideration, it takes into consideration what follows the statement, it makes a great deal of sense as you study the passage.
[time=1920] It says that a woman's highest calling is in the childbearing, child rearing responsibility.
[time=1929] Now I say that with conviction, and I say it loudly, but I know as I say it, it is like a man standing up in the midst of an on-rushing current,
[time=1941] and he's the only one there while the current and influence of the time is just rushing against him.
[time=1947] For instance, did you know that in our culture today one-third of the couples of childbearing age
[time=1954] are permanently sterilized because they want nothing to do with children?
[time=1958] In a recent survey that was taken in our culture, 70% of the parents that were asked the question said,
[time=1964] if they had it to do over again, they would not have any children, they didn't want any children, it was a mistake.
[time=1970] There is an organization which has grown up in our country called NAN, N-A-N.
[time=1975] It is the national association of non-parents, and it is headed up by a man we all recognize from television, a fellow by the name of Hugh Downs, he is a prominent figure in that organization.
[time=1989] And one of their favorite models is this, don't foul up your lives with kids,
[time=1996] and they have come together around the theme of not having families and not having children,
[time=2002] and they have an organization now that feeds that idea.
[time=2006] Now some of you, probably if you're going through some of the rough years, I want to know if we brought application blanks to the service this morning, we don't have any, and we don't want you to get involved in signing up.
[time=2018] But what I'm saying is this, God glorifies the home, He glorifies the role of the mother,
[time=2025] He glorifies what happens in the domain of the home, and that is totally opposite from what we're seeing in our culture today.
[time=2033] That's one of the reasons why I'm not overly infatuated with the modern feminist movement, the ERA.
[time=2039] If you knew what they have in mind for the family, you wouldn't be excited about it either.
[time=2044] For instance, recently I read something written by Gloria Steinem, one of the leading feminists in our country today.
[time=2052] She is the editor of Ms. Magazine, and she has written of her goal in the feminist battle, I quote,
[time=2058] "By the year 2000 we will, I hope, raise our children to believe in human potential, not in God,
[time=2065] in a speech in Houston," Texas Steinem said, "for the sake of those who wish to live in equal partnership,
[time=2072] we have to abolish and reform the institution of marriage."
[time=2079] One of the other leaders in the feminist organization is a woman by the name of Mary Jo Bain.
[time=2084] She is the associate director of Wellesley College's Center for Research on Women, and she writes, I quote,
[time=2092] "We really don't know how to raise our children.
[time=2095] The fact that children are raised in families means there's no equality.
[time=2099] In order to raise children with equality, we must take them away from families who raise them."
[time=2106] One of the most astounding and most frightening of all of the statements that I have read from the feminists
[time=2112] is found in this paragraph from a paper called "The Declaration of Feminism."
[time=2119] Marriage has existed for the benefit of men, and has been a legally sanctioned method of control over women.
[time=2128] The end of the institution of marriage is a necessary condition for the liberation of women.
[time=2134] Therefore, it is important for us to encourage women to leave their husbands and not to live individually with men,
[time=2141] we must work to destroy marriage.
[time=2144] The document goes on to say in another place, the nuclear family must be replaced with a new form of family,
[time=2151] where individuals live and work together to help meet the needs of all people in the society.
[time=2157] With the destruction of the nuclear family must come a new way of looking at children.
[time=2162] They must be seen as the responsibility of the entire society rather than individual parents,
[time=2169] and men and women the government of our country is involved today in legislation
[time=2175] that is trying to get control of the children in our homes in that very same vein as I have read today.
[time=2182] The women's liberationists have as their five goals for which they strive the following.
[time=2188] Number one, man is the enemy.
[time=2190] Number two, babies lead to bondage.
[time=2194] Number three, total equality is a fact, not just a goal.
[time=2200] Number four, marriage must be eliminated.
[time=2203] And number five, above all, religious belief must be changed.
[time=2212] And yet God says that the role of a woman in the home is a high and holy place of leadership and responsibility,
[time=2223] and it ought to be glorified and magnified and lifted up.
[time=2228] What bothers me most about the subject I address today is the fact that the world embraces what we have just heard,
[time=2240] but far too many Christian families are living after the pattern of the world's concept of the modern home and family.
[time=2250] I have even heard Christian women's speakers speak disparagingly of the role of a mother who stays at home to minister to her family.
[time=2262] And folks, I want to tell you something, if we don't get this back into perspective, there won't be any way that we can ever pass on what we have to the next generation, and Christianity has every possibility of dying within the next generation or so
[time=2277] because our homes are so dissipated, we have no means of communicating our faith to our children.
[time=2285] I am so convinced that motherhood is one of the highest callings for every woman that I want to share with you today,
[time=2292] five reasons why it should be paramount in your life, and I hope you will listen carefully.
[time=2299] Number one, you ought to see motherhood as a high and holy calling, ladies, because it is the greatest way you will ever find to influence children for God.
[time=2312] Someone wrote years ago a very interesting proverb, I think it's a Spanish proverb, it goes like this,
[time=2319] an ounce of mother is worth a pound of clergy.
[time=2322] I believe that, I believe that a mother has the greatest opportunity to influence the young ones in her home far greater than a preacher could ever have,
[time=2333] far greater than a school teacher could ever have, the mother is the one single influence in the life of a child,
[time=2339] especially in the early years, that has the greatest impact.
[time=2343] G. Campbell Morgan, a great preacher of a bygone day, had four sons in his family, and all of them were preachers.
[time=2351] I am told that one time he was at a reunion, and all of the sons were there, and a friend of the families came up and asked one of the boys, said, "Of all the preachers in the Morgan family, which one is the greatest?" And the boy said, "Mother Morgan is the greatest, she's the greatest preacher in this family."
[time=2370] And it was a testimony to her that out of that family, these young men were reared and nurtured to love the Lord and to be servants of God.
[time=2380] He was a man by the name of Philip's Brooks, who is considered one of the prince of preachers of a past day.
[time=2387] When his mother died, that great preacher of a former generation, together with his brothers, erected a grave marker in grateful honor of what she had meant to all of them.
[time=2398] On the tombstone, they inscribed these words.
[time=2402] The words spoken by Christ to the Syrophoenician woman, "O woman, greatest thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt."
[time=2413] If you go back through history, you will discover that the great men of God, with very few exceptions, can trace their godliness and commitment to the things of an almighty God and his ministry
[time=2426] back to a saintly, godly mother who invested her life in them and spent time inculcating into their lives the truths of the Word of God and instilled within them a desire to serve God with all of their lives.
[time=2441] You cannot, by being an absent team mother, rear up in your home a giant for the cause of Christ.
[time=2449] And so one of the great and most important reasons for you to commit yourself to the godly and highly acceptable before God role of a saintly mother is to influence your children for God.
[time=2465] Secondly, I believe that you need to be committed to motherhood as the Bible teaches it in spite of what the culture says, to instill and enforce godly habits and principles in your children.
[time=2481] Now there's a fallacy about rearing children that anyone who's had any time trying it realizes just doesn't fly, and that is that children learn when you tell them what to do.
[time=2493] That doesn't work at my house.
[time=2496] If that were true, we could sell a set of records and just market them to families, turn them on in the morning and we wouldn't have to work at all.
[time=2503] Children only learn how to do what they're supposed to do when they're first of all told what to do, and then there are parents who are standing in the gap making sure that what they're told to do, they do.
[time=2516] And I have discovered in my home that that's not just one time or two times, but that's over and over and over and over again. And when it doesn't happen, I have to be right there and saying no, but you will not do that.
[time=2528] And it's not just a matter of their actions, but it's a matter of their attitudes and the constant supervisory role of the parent within the home to enforce and to inculcate within the lives of the children, the standards and the beliefs.
[time=2545] And the commitments that are necessary for them to be mature as they grow, that cannot happen with an absentee parent. It just can't happen.
[time=2557] Mrs. Barton was broken hearted.
[time=2561] Why had her 16-year-old daughter left home and married a 22-year-old man she had never met?
[time=2568] Why had Sally announced that she would never again darken the door of her home? Sally's mother was as surprised as she was dismayed that her pretty intelligent daughter had actually gone away to another state to get married without telling a word to anyone?
[time=2585] Mrs. Barton had a right to be dismayed, but she should not have been surprised. She had not done much to encourage her daughter to achieve a proper sense of Christian values.
[time=2598] For every afternoon, Sally had come home from school to an empty house. Mrs. Barton had taken a full-time job when Sally was 11.
[time=2607] She took the job to pay off a few bills that had accumulated intending to quit when the bills were paid, but she got used to the gigantic check that she brought home, at least in her mind, every week, and she couldn't give it up.
[time=2621] When Sally complained about how lonely it was when she came home, her mother just responded, "Sally, you're a big girl now. You don't need mother around to blow your nose anymore."
[time=2633] When her daughter started bringing home boys at all hours, mom and dad were seldom around. Mrs. Barton never pointed out the dangers of this kind of practice.
[time=2643] "We don't want our girl to feel we are against her," she said, "or that we are critical of her friends."
[time=2653] And along with this, Mrs. Barton openly complained about the monotony of parenthood.
[time=2659] "There just isn't anything exciting about making beds, cooking meals, cleaning house," she often said.
[time=2668] When her husband suggested that maybe his wife wasn't being fair with him and with their daughter, she responded, "If you think I'm going to spend the rest of my days babysitting and drying dishes, you've got another thing coming."
[time=2682] And so she went to work, and she lost her family.
[time=2695] She cries a lot now, but it doesn't do any good, for the decision was made long ago.
[time=2703] Many women, if we are going to instill in the lives of our children the things that are important for them as they face the next generation, we have to be there to do it.
[time=2714] There is a cop-out mythology statement that has come into our prison understanding of the family, and I've mentioned this before, and I want to say it again, it goes like this.
[time=2726] Not the quality, not the quantity of time you spend with your children, it's the quality of time.
[time=2733] Do you know what I've observed about that statement?
[time=2735] The only people who ever use it are the people who know in their hearts they're not spending enough time with their kids, and it's a cop-out.
[time=2743] And all of us would like to believe it, but friends, you can't have quality if you don't have any quantity.
[time=2748] It takes time to instill and enforce the principles of godliness in the lives of your children.
[time=2754] Number three.
[time=2756] We need mothers who really are committed to being mothers, not only to instruct and instill and enforce godly habits and principles, but folks listen to this now.
[time=2767] We need mothers who are willing to be mothers first and foremost in order that they might instruct the next generation of mothers.
[time=2775] How do you learn how to be a mother?
[time=2778] Well, I see women getting married and they don't have the clue. I mean, they don't have the slightest idea.
[time=2783] It's, you know, try what you can and try to figure it out.
[time=2787] In past days, and I am not trying to be an historyist today, but in past days, young girls learn how to be mothers when they grew up in a home with a mother who was committed to passing on to them, what she had learned from her mother, and they learned all of those special things, the culinary arts,
[time=2807] all of the beauty of being what a mother ought to be.
[time=2811] But that isn't happening today.
[time=2815] We depend on a home economics course to do it.
[time=2819] I want to show you a passage of scripture that I read again this week that just impressed upon me this truth.
[time=2825] It's found in the book of Titus just to your right a little bit. Will you look there?
[time=2831] I think this passage of scripture holds out the opportunity for a great new ministry in our church.
[time=2836] I don't know what we're going to call it, motherhood training, perhaps.
[time=2840] But Paul in writing to Titus is talking about the role of the older men and the older women within the congregation.
[time=2847] And he speaks beginning in verse one of Titus chapter two, and this is what he says.
[time=2853] But speak now the things which become sound doctrine, that the aged men be sober-minded, that they be grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love and in patience.
[time=2863] Now get this, that the aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becoming holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things.
[time=2874] Now here's what they're supposed to do. Here's their role.
[time=2878] That they teach the young women to be sober-minded, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet,
[time=2885] to be pure or chaste, to be get this one.
[time=2899] The woman is to teach the younger woman to be sober-minded, that means to have a serious outlook on life.
[time=2904] She is to teach that woman to love her husband, to love her children, to be discreet, to be pure or chaste, to be get this one.
[time=2914] Keepers at home.
[time=2917] I looked that up in the Greek language. Do you know what it means?
[time=2921] It means to be keepers at home.
[time=2931] To be good, to be obedient to their own husbands.
[time=2935] Now what in the world is the best place, where in the world is the best place for an older woman to teach a younger woman how to be all of this?
[time=2943] Where is it class in the home?
[time=2948] When I want to promise you something, if your life is totally other than that as a mother, and you never have any time to model what that is before your children,
[time=2958] you can say all you want to in the instruction class and it won't get past first base because they're going to hear what they see.
[time=2965] They're not going to hear what they hear.
[time=2970] And I'm deeply concerned not only about the generation in which we live folks, I'm concerned about the next generation.
[time=2976] Where are the mothers of our future evangelical churches going to learn what a godly mother is supposed to be?
[time=2984] If we abdicate the role of motherhood in our churches today.
[time=2990] If you want another passage that fortifies this you need to look at 1 Timothy 514, the instruction to young women to marry, bear children and guide the house.
[time=3000] I really believe the highest calling God ever gave to a woman is to be a godly mother in the home.
[time=3007] Now last but not least, our number four, there's one more after that, number four.
[time=3016] The reason why a woman ought to give herself to motherhood as her primary calling is that she might invest her life in the highest calling available to women.
[time=3029] I found something in the Old Testament that was a real blessing and encouragement to me in this regard.
[time=3035] Way back in the book of Genesis chapter 3 and verse 20, we read what happened when God brought Eve to Adam.
[time=3046] I think it's really comical to read it in the Hebrew language.
[time=3049] We don't get the nuance in our language when Adam saw Eve, he made a statement which is recorded in the language of the Old Testament that sounds very stiff and stifled.
[time=3061] And in our culture today it would be like whoopi, look what God did for me.
[time=3066] But in chapter 3 of Genesis verse 20, Adam looks at Eve and this is what we read.
[time=3073] And Adam called his wife's name Eve, now notice the next phrase, because she was the mother of all living.
[time=3085] And Martin Luther once said, as he wrote on this passage, when Eve was brought unto Adam, he became filled with the Holy Spirit and he gave her the most sanctified, the most glorious appellation.
[time=3098] He called her Eve, that is to say the mother of all.
[time=3102] He did not style her wife, but simply mother.
[time=3106] And in this, says Luther, consists the glory and the most precious ornament of a woman.
[time=3113] Oh, how many today have forgotten that the highest calling of womanhood is to be a saintly, godly Christian mother.
[time=3126] Ten college, if you have to, be accomplished in any other field, however desirable.
[time=3134] Yet a young woman has missed out on God's best if she has sacrificed what God intended for her in motherhood, for a career in any other sphere.
[time=3145] That doesn't mean, and I am not intending to say, that no woman should ever work.
[time=3151] My wife has a ministry in our school every afternoon for a couple of hours in teaching typing.
[time=3157] But if your work moves you out of the place of influence and responsibility is the mother in your home, I don't care what you do it for, it's not worth it.
[time=3168] And let me say it, it's not even worth it to pay the tuition for your kid to go to a Christian school.
[time=3180] So how are you doing?
[time=3182] Are you all still with me? Okay, now I'm going to give you a test.
[time=3187] Are you ready?
[time=3189] I'm going to give you a test to see how you're doing.
[time=3192] I want you to be honest, ladies. You don't have to answer out loud in husbands, no rib poking. All right?
[time=3203] Question number one. Mothers, are you willing to sacrifice money to be a good mother?
[time=3215] Now answer that honestly. Are you willing to sacrifice money to be a good mother?
[time=3223] A shiny set of new furniture looks pretty good sometimes, doesn't it? A new cabin at the lake, the great status symbol.
[time=3233] Maybe that second car is really coming unglued.
[time=3238] But if you obtain any of those things at the price of child desertion, the price is too high.
[time=3247] What I see happening in the lives of a lot of families is mothers who go to work "temporarily".
[time=3256] But then get accustomed to the income that temporary employment supplies and they never can give it up and their children fall off the edge because of that.
[time=3267] Question number two, ladies.
[time=3270] Are you willing to be near your children?
[time=3275] Now that doesn't mean that you're with them all the time. That would drive even the sanest of people right up the wall.
[time=3284] What I mean by that is, are you willing to be near enough to be available to them when they need you?
[time=3291] If your family is like mine, you have to have someone there most of the time so that someone can call Daddy and say,
[time=3300] "Danny fell down again and he needs to go to the hospital so I come home and there we go."
[time=3310] Number three, now listen carefully ladies, this is critical, not just for you but for your children as well.
[time=3319] Do you speak highly of your calling?
[time=3329] Mothers who act like home is a prison will produce children who are restless and discontented.
[time=3338] One young lady wrote of her mother, "My mother acts as if she were counting the days until I'm old enough to leave home."
[time=3348] So that's what I'm going to do, I'm getting out of this place as soon as I can.
[time=3357] I hear ladies, sometimes even Christian ladies, talking about how tough it is to be at home.
[time=3363] And we've raised partially, we're just getting started for children and two sets of them really.
[time=3372] And they've been close and there have been times when I've come home and I don't even ask Donna how the day went.
[time=3377] I just see in her face that it's not a good question to ask.
[time=3383] And I know it's tough and I know there are times when it gets rough.
[time=3386] It's repetitious, it's the same over and over again.
[time=3389] But you know what, anything you do has repetition.
[time=3392] Any job that I know of has the sameness that you have to fight.
[time=3397] But one thing that I know that will kill a commitment to the home and family and your children
[time=3403] faster than anything else you can do is if you badmouthed all the time what God has called you to be as a godly Christian mother.
[time=3411] If you're always putting it down, if you're always talking as if you wish you could enjoy that quote unquote "exciting life" of a career woman
[time=3418] when God has called you to be a mother.
[time=3424] Last but not least, do you involve yourselves, yourself, in the life of your children?
[time=3431] What is a mother for?
[time=3435] I can answer that with one word.
[time=3437] Mothers are for children.
[time=3443] Do you have time for them?
[time=3445] Do you take time with them?
[time=3450] We went yesterday to see a little league game.
[time=3458] It seems like we do that a lot these days in the cold and in the rain.
