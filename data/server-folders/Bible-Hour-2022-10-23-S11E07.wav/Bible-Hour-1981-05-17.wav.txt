[time=0] [bell ringing] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=22] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerrimon.
[time=27] [MUSIC]
[time=32] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=44] Normally our Minister of Music is here conducting our congregation as they sing, but he, who has an evangelist brother, are working together in an evangelistic crusade this week and our prayers are with them.
[time=56] As they minister the Word of God in another place, we're grateful for your presence here today, all of you who have gathered here in the auditorium, for this second worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, guests from other places and other towns and visitors from our own area, as well as all of you who are part of this local assembly, we welcome you.
[time=76] And for those of you who have joined us now by way of television, we thank you for the privilege of coming into your homes, places of business with the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=87] We hope it will be a blessing and an encouragement to you during this hour.
[time=91] Right now, our choir is in the direction today of Mr. Rick Holes, and they are singing for us a song entitled, "Come Let Us Sing of His Glory."
[time=103] [MUSIC - 123 seconds]
[time=231] Thank you, Rick, for directing our choir today and for the Ministry of Music.
[time=236] We have, in the Ministry of Music today, a number of old hymns that have been set to some new arrangements and new cadences, and I just want you to listen carefully now to our own Stephen Maria Gardner, as they sing for us "How Firm a Foundation."
[time=254] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=359] We're so happy to have you with us today, and we thank you for sharing in the Bible Hour.
[time=363] We appreciate so very much the opportunity that we have as a couple to share with you in this very special moment in the middle of our telecast.
[time=371] We think that as husband and wife, it's just a great privilege to come and visit with you in your home and talk to you about the things that are very important to the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=380] Don, I know you have some things that you want to share in a few moments about some people who have helped us in a very significant way,
[time=387] but before you do that, let me just encourage the folks who are watching to take advantage of the opportunity that we have reestablished for you to
[time=396] have this very special little piece of literature called "The Answer Book." I want to share with you that this past week we received a letter from a lady who wrote to us and she said, "Dear Pastor Jeremiah, just this week,
[time=408] we had need to use Pastor Jeremiah's Answer Book as a counseling tool.
[time=412] It meant so much to have it close by.
[time=415] We believe that the Answer Book is a very special help to people who are involved in serving God today.
[time=421] The Answer Book is a list of scriptures that have been put together topically so that as you look through the book,
[time=428] you can find the pertinent scriptures on the major concerns of today's world.
[time=432] Things such as anger and worry and concern and grief.
[time=436] All of those things that you face in the work of day world as you walk through your life, there's something from the Word of God that addresses those problems, and they're all here in the Answer Book, and it's our gift to you absolutely free if you'll write to us this week.
[time=450] And our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=459] But if you're like me, it's often difficult to find time to sit down and write, and so we have a free phone number for you to call, toll free 1-800-45-39000.
[time=471] Just ask for the Bible Hour Operator and tell her that you would like a free copy of the Answer Book, and she'll get that information to us and we'll have a copy in the mail to you.
[time=480] We also have a couple of associate sponsors for today's program, Joe Kerry of Arcadia, Indiana, Fuses on Channel 21, and Charles Murray of Fort Wayne, Indiana also on Channel 21.
[time=496] And we want to say a great big thank you to you folks for your part in ministry today.
[time=501] Donna, it means so much that people care enough about the Word of God and the preaching of the gospel that they will get behind this ministry financially, and we don't spend, as you know, very much time on the air talking about our financial needs, and yet I need to say to you that those needs are just as real as if we spent the whole hour telling you about them.
[time=519] And that means that we need to hear from you, and we need to encourage you to be a part of this program
[time=525] of the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=528] We know that there are many of you who really believe in what we're doing in the Bible Hour.
[time=531] We thank you for your support in the past, and especially during these days, we'd like to encourage you to continue in your prayer and in your financial support of the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=541] As God lays the burden upon your heart, give a generous gift today to help, as we reach out to our world with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=549] We have some more good music that I know you'll enjoy, and then in just a moment, I'm going to be bringing a message on the subject.
[time=555] I am the true vine, one of the messages from the great I.M. statements of Christ in the gospel of John.
[time=561] I hope you'll stay with us. We're looking forward to sharing the remainder of this hour with each of you.
[time=572] [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=786] Thank you Ron Hackett for your ministry and music.
[time=789] We have had two of the great old hymns set to new settings and shared with us by our musicians.
[time=795] And just before the message, we're going to listen to two very, very familiar hymns of invitation.
[time=801] Just as I am, and Jesus I come, put together in a beautiful medley and presented to us by Marilyn Wong.
[time=809] [MUSIC]
[time=828] Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me,
[time=847] and that thou bidst me come to thee, O land of God I come.
[time=864] I come.
[time=876] Jesus I come.
[time=886] Into thy freedom, gladness and light.
[time=895] Jesus I come to thee.
[time=904] Out of my sinness, into thy hand, out of my want and into thyself, out of my sin and into thyself.
[time=933] Jesus I come to thee.
[time=939] And thou bidst me come to thee, O land of God I come.
[time=954] I come.
[time=972] [MUSIC]
[time=982] Thank you, Marilyn. Those are two very beautiful old invitation hymns that mean much to all of us.
[time=990] Now we're going to open our Bibles today to the book of John, John's Gospel, the fourth book of the New Testament.
[time=996] And our study is in the 15th chapter, John chapter 15, and I'm reading verses one through five, John 15, one through five.
[time=1009] As many of you know, we have been studying the great statements of our Lord, the "I am" statements of John's Gospel.
[time=1017] The particular places in this book where Jesus Christ says about himself some very important things.
[time=1026] And we come now to this statement in John 15, "As I read verses one through five, you follow in your Bibles.
[time=1033] I am the true vine. And my father is the vine dresser. Every branch in me that bareth not fruit, he takeeth away.
[time=1043] And every branch that bareth fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[time=1049] Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. A bite in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it a bite in the vine.
[time=1058] No more can ye except ye a bite in me. I am the vine. Ye are the branches. He that a biteeth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[time=1069] For without me ye can do nothing. Shall we pray?"
[time=1076] Our God in heaven, we ask that you will take these moments that we have together to share in the teaching of thy word and use them that they might be profitable unto us.
[time=1087] We come here today, both here in this auditorium and as we share together by television with hearts that are hungry to know God's truth.
[time=1098] And we would pray that we will not waste the opportunity that we have before us to learn what God would say to us from His word.
[time=1106] But that with all diligence we will concentrate on hearing the word of God that we might go forth from this place to be doers also.
[time=1114] For we pray in Jesus' name and for His sake. Amen.
[time=1121] I don't suppose in any time in history from the beginning until today there have been more crazy ideas about what it means to be successful in the Christian life.
[time=1136] If you would go to the bookstores in your town or here in our town and go to the section marked Christian life, you will find volume after volume after volume
[time=1149] that are being produced to share with us the deep hidden secret of being successful as a Christian.
[time=1157] I heard recently about a pastor who felt he had come to the truth of success.
[time=1164] He was taking a course in numerology and his seminary, the study of numbers.
[time=1169] He got so obsessed with this particular course that while he began to dream at night,
[time=1177] in fact he dreamed everything and triplicate.
[time=1181] He saw three wives, each of his children were three.
[time=1187] He saw three houses where he lived, he saw three cars that he drove, three jobs, everything was in triplicate.
[time=1193] And he began to believe that the secret to success in the Christian experience was the number three.
[time=1199] Why, after all, wasn't God a Trinity? Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? And wasn't this the real truth behind all meaningful living?
[time=1207] According to the story, one morning he walked out on his porch to retrieve the morning paper, and when he looked down,
[time=1213] he discovered that the paper that he was looking at had been produced in the third month on the third day,
[time=1220] and it was the three-star edition, the third edition.
[time=1224] And he said to himself, "My, this has got to be significant to the future of my spiritual being.
[time=1229] I wonder what's on the third page and in the third column." And so he opened the paper to the third page and the third column, and there he saw the racing form for the daily double.
[time=1240] "My," he said, "how could that figure into my spiritual life?" And then he thought, "I wonder what horse is running in the third race in the third lane."
[time=1250] And he looked down, and lo and behold, the horse's name was Trio.
[time=1256] Why, he said, "This has got to be from God.
[time=1260] This is the answer not only to my own personal success, but to the financial problems of our church.
[time=1267] I will take this as from God," and he went and drew out all of his savings, liquidated all of his assets,
[time=1273] and behind the disguise went to the track, and he bet everything he had on Trio.
[time=1280] And you guessed it, Trio came in third.
[time=1284] We laugh at that, but I want to tell you something, it is no sillier than many of the things that I have read
[time=1297] under the guise of telling us how to be successful as Christians.
[time=1303] And I personally believe that the chapter we are studying today holds for us some of the greatest truth
[time=1310] that you will read any place in God's holy word to help you be what God calls a success.
[time=1319] Now the 14th chapter of John ends according to what I read in my Bible with Christ and his disciples leaving.
[time=1328] "Arise, let us go," says the text.
[time=1331] And as we examine the picture of where they were and where they were going, we understand that their journey took them through the Kidron Valley, down next to the walls of Jerusalem.
[time=1342] And there, as they walked through that beautiful section of Jerusalem, surrounding Jerusalem,
[time=1348] they walked through the valleys that were covered with vines.
[time=1352] In fact, next to the walls of Jerusalem, there would have been vineyards and vines.
[time=1356] And it's quite possible that as Jesus conducted his disciples on that way, that he used the surroundings as he so often did as an object lesson for a great spiritual truth.
[time=1368] He said, as he walked through that valley, "I am the true vine."
[time=1375] I am overwhelmed at how many times our Lord used object lessons.
[time=1381] We have the illustration in the New Testament of the big tree.
[time=1385] Last Sunday night in our evening service, we talked about our Lord using the ripened wheat fields
[time=1391] to encourage his disciples to be fruitful in their evangelism.
[time=1395] He met the woman at the well, and he used the water as an illustration of what real life was all about.
[time=1402] He used the bread that he multiplied in the loaves to describe his ability to be the bread of life for all of us.
[time=1410] But here he is taking an example from the world of horticulture to teach his disciples,
[time=1416] and obviously to teach us what it means to be a fruitful and successful Christian.
[time=1423] Now I want us to notice and study this chapter, first of all as we discuss this term,
[time=1429] "the true vine and the source of life." When he speaks of himself as the true vine, he is talking about the fact that he is true as opposed to all other false versions of the vine.
[time=1443] I was interested to discover, as I studied the Bible this week, that quite often in the Old Testament, the concept of the vine,
[time=1450] the use of the term vine was a picture that God used to describe the nation of Israel.
[time=1459] For instance, if you had your Bibles and we could quickly turn to them to the Book of Isaiah, you would read this,
[time=1465] "My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he dug it and gathered out the stones and planted it with the choicest vine,
[time=1473] and he built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine present, and he looked for it to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes."
[time=1482] The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.
[time=1489] You will find this truth in Isaiah, in Jeremiah, in Ezekiel, over and over again in the Old Testament.
[time=1495] The picture of the vine is used to describe the nation of Israel.
[time=1499] Interestingly enough, in all of the scriptures that I saw, it always seems as if the vineyard of Israel is an unproductive vine.
[time=1508] We speak of it here in this term as a vine which brings forth wild grapes.
[time=1512] And over and over again in the Old Testament, Israel is cast in this light.
[time=1517] She is God's vineyard, but instead of being productive and fruitful and successful, she disappoints the vine dresser with fruit that is not in keeping, with God's expectations.
[time=1528] And I am certain that Jesus Christ, as he walked through the vineyard that day, knew that his disciples understood this Old Testament picture, and so he said as he walked out into the vineyard,
[time=1539] "I am the true vine, as opposed to the unfaithful vine of Israel.
[time=1544] I am the true vine, and if you abide in me, you will be successful." He is saying, "He is the one perfect, essential, and enduring vine as opposed to other vines which are just a shadow of the real."
[time=1559] Jesus said, "I am the true vine."
[time=1567] Now it's interesting to me that Jesus did not say, "I am the root," and you are the branches.
[time=1572] He said, "I am the vine," for you see, by using the term vine, he includes everything within that term.
[time=1578] If he is the vine, then he is also the branch.
[time=1581] If he is the vine, then he is the root, and the stock, and the tendrils, and the leaves, and the fruit, the vine is an inclusive term that includes everything that's a part of it.
[time=1590] He says, "I am the vine, and you are the branches, and so as a branch you are part of me.
[time=1595] You are part of what I am." And that's what he would teach his disciples. He is the source of true life.
[time=1603] Now as we study this passage of Scripture, we discover that the true vine holds for us the principle and teaching of real success as a Christian.
[time=1614] I have often said that if I could figure out a way to motivate the businessmen and the young professional men in our church to be as aggressive in terms of spiritual successes,
[time=1628] they are out in the business world, why there would be no limitation to what God could do through us as a congregation.
[time=1634] I see men who burn the midnight oil and burn up their lives to be successful, who apparently haven't gotten hold of the terminology of success from the New Testament, and I want you to know that God is interested in our being successful, and that's what all of this fruit-bearing is about in this passage of Scripture.
[time=1651] He wants us to be productive in our Christian lives, and he wants to help us understand how that works.
[time=1657] You see, the purpose of a vine is not just to spread out its branches.
[time=1663] It is not something to look at. The purpose of a vine is that it might produce fruit, that it might be productive,
[time=1670] and God is teaching us in this passage of Scripture that he is willing to supply for us the nourishment,
[time=1677] the life, the sustenance, the energy, so that we can be productive in his behalf.
[time=1684] I don't know about you, but a lot that I see that goes under the name of fruit is nothing more than fungus.
[time=1693] Fungus does not come from the source of life in the vine, fungus is a parasite.
[time=1699] It attaches itself to the vine, and in essence, it sucks the very life out of the vine and destroys the fruit.
[time=1706] There are a lot of Christians today who think they're being fruitful, but they're not plugged into the source.
[time=1713] They're doing their work in the energy of the flesh, and they're sort of attaching themselves to the outward exterior of the vine,
[time=1719] but instead of really being an outgrowth of what Christ is doing in them, they've just attached themselves for the look of fruitfulness.
[time=1731] I've discovered in my study of the Word of God that when God tells us that we're to bear fruit, he means at least three things.
[time=1738] Here in this passage of Scripture, he talks about the result of abiding in the vine as being fruitful.
[time=1744] I want you to notice that first of all, there are three different qualities of fruitfulness, and some of you know this,
[time=1750] but we need to review it briefly this morning.
[time=1752] First of all, when God talks about our being successful as Christians and being fruitful, what he means is this,
[time=1759] that we are to be different in our character.
[time=1763] If we had time this morning, we would turn to Galatians 5, and beginning at verse 22, we have the cataloging of the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=1772] And there are nine different qualities in that list, in that cluster of fruitful grapes.
[time=1779] The Bible says that if we're filled with the Spirit, we will be certain kinds of people.
[time=1784] Our character will be like this. We will be filled with love, and joy, and peace, and long suffering, and gentleness, and goodness, and faith, and meatness, and temperance.
[time=1794] These nine qualities of our character will be being reproduced in us because we're plugged into the source.
[time=1802] When God says that we're to bear fruit, he means that we're to be different kinds of people.
[time=1808] I want you to notice that it is not like this branch over here has the fruit of love, and this branch over here has the fruit of joy,
[time=1817] and this branch back here has the fruit of temperance.
[time=1820] The Bible says that all of these things are clusters in the same fruit, so that off of every branch, this kind of characteristic is to be true.
[time=1829] I am to possess all nine qualities. I cannot pick and choose which ones I want to emulate in behalf of my Lord.
[time=1837] If you study Galatians 5, you will discover that there is a very interesting interplay between the term "the works of the flesh" plural
[time=1846] and the fruit of the Spirit singular.
[time=1849] The works are individual things that characterized us before we were saved, but when we become Christians, and we abide in Christ,
[time=1856] the characteristics of the spiritual life will come in that cluster, and those categories will be true of us.
[time=1862] We will be reproducing good character in our own lives through the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=1868] But I notice, secondly, as I study the Bible, that the second kind of fruit is what we might call conduct fruit.
[time=1875] We read about this over in the book of Romans, and chapter 6 and verses 20 and 21. Listen carefully to what it says.
[time=1882] For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness. Now note, what fruit had ye then in those things were of you are now ashamed.
[time=1895] Paul is saying to the Romans, do you remember what it was like back when you were unsaved before you became a Christian?
[time=1901] Do you remember all of the things that you did as you conducted yourself as an unsaved person?
[time=1906] Do you remember that? Paul said, I want to ask you a question. What fruit did you have in those things?
[time=1911] And he uses the terminology of fruit to describe the certain conduct that a person had back in the old life.
[time=1919] When we come to the New Testament in the book of Colossians, we are told that we are to be fruitful in every good work.
[time=1928] God is interested not only in our character, but he wants us to be fruitful in our conduct, in what we do in our good works.
[time=1937] We are to be fruitful in minded in reaching out to others and ministering the works, which God tells us to do.
[time=1946] And then there is a third characteristic, and the one that is missing in most Christians' lives.
[time=1952] Most Christians that I know have some semblance of the characteristic of the Spirit of God in the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=1959] Most Christians that I know who are walking in fellowship with the Lord conduct themselves in a certain given way.
[time=1966] But the third kind of fruit is given to us in Romans 1-13, where we read of Paul writing to the Romans and he says this,
[time=1975] Now I would not have you ignorant brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, now listen to this,
[time=1982] that I might have some fruit among you. What is he talking about?
[time=1988] Well, let me ask you a question. Back in the book of Genesis, when we have the great command to us from our Lord,
[time=1996] given to our federal parents, Adam and Eve, when he said to them, be fruitful and multiply.
[time=2005] What do you think he meant?
[time=2008] Why, it's obvious to us when we read that, that he was saying to Adam and Eve, have children reproduce yourself in the lives of others,
[time=2015] be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
[time=2018] Then why is it so hard for us when we come to the New Testament and God speaks to us about being fruitful spiritually?
[time=2025] Why is it so hard for us to understand that he is talking to us about spiritual reproduction?
[time=2031] That God is interested certainly in our character, that he is interested in us being successful in our conduct,
[time=2037] but that also he cares that we bring converts to him and that we are reproducing ourselves by winning others to Jesus Christ,
[time=2045] that we are being successful in the realm of soul winning and causing others to come to the Lord Jesus Christ and reproducing ourselves in them as the fruit which we bring to the Lord.
[time=2056] The three qualities of success that he speaks about in this passage, when he speaks of fruit bearing,
[time=2066] are character and conduct in converts and they just ask yourself the question this morning, how am I doing in those areas?
[time=2073] Well he gives to us some quantities of fruit bearing that I find most interesting and you will find those right here in the 15th chapter.
[time=2081] First of all in verse two, he speaks of some who have no fruit at all.
[time=2086] Every branch in me, that beareth, what does it say? Not fruit.
[time=2092] It's possible to be a Christian and be totally unproductive.
[time=2096] You can't be a happy Christian like that, but he says it's possible to be a Christian and have no fruitfulness at all.
[time=2103] That's called carnality.
[time=2105] But then he gives us three levels of fruitfulness in this passage that I think are interesting.
[time=2111] First of all in verse two, he says, every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he takeeth away, and every branch that beareth fruit, there's the first level.
[time=2120] Some folks are just fruit bearers, they're just sort of successful in character conduct in converts, they're just sort in on the ground floor.
[time=2128] Now go on in verse two and notice that he continues this progression.
[time=2132] He purges it that it may bring forth what's the next level.
[time=2137] More fruit.
[time=2138] There are some folks who are Christians who are more fruitful than others.
[time=2142] They're reproducing the characteristics of Jesus Christ and they're reproducing in their own conduct, the life of Christ,
[time=2148] and they're winning others to Christ that they're just more fruitful.
[time=2152] But the desire of the Almighty God and of the heavenly vine dresser is that we might imbibe the terminology of chapter 15 verses five and eight where we read.
[time=2163] I am the vine, you are the branches, he that abideth in me and I and him, the same bringeth forth, what does it say?
[time=2171] Much fruit, and in verse eight, in this is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit.
[time=2181] So shall you be my disciples.
[time=2183] Now just stop for a moment.
[time=2185] Jesus said I am the true vine, and my desire is that you get plugged into me so that you can reproduce my character, my works, and reproduce my spirit in the lives of other people.
[time=2200] And I recognize that there are some who don't do that at all, they have no fruit.
[time=2205] And there are some who just do it a little bit, they have some fruit, and then there are those who do it more, but my goal is that all of you might bear much fruit.
[time=2215] Now just stop for a moment, let me say this.
[time=2217] God wants you to be successful as a Christian.
[time=2224] He's not interested in mediocrity.
[time=2228] He's not interested in you just throwing your hat in the ring and getting in the beginning stages.
[time=2233] He wants you to be as success as a Christian.
[time=2236] His goal for you is not the bottom rung or the second rung, but the top rung that you might be most fruitful in his vineyard.
[time=2245] In the Gospels we have a story that gives to us a quantitative picture where we're told that some went out and they bore fruit thirtyfold.
[time=2256] That's fruit.
[time=2258] And some bore fruit sixtyfold, that's more fruit, but there were some who bore fruit a hundredfold.
[time=2265] And I just want to encourage you that the goal in the heart of God for each of us who are part of the family of God is that we might get up to that top level of being increasingly fruitful for our for our Savior.
[time=2279] That is the true vine and the success of life.
[time=2284] Now notice thirdly the true vine and the simplicity of life.
[time=2288] How do we become successful?
[time=2291] What is the principle?
[time=2294] Have you ever walked out into an orchard?
[time=2297] Maybe an apple orchard?
[time=2300] And it was just time for the fruit to begin.
[time=2305] And you stood out there and you watched and you saw the tree just begin to shake.
[time=2309] Just begin to quake and just begin to vibrate as it pushed the apple out on the stem and finally the apple through great struggle and furious activity.
[time=2319] Finally it got bigger and bigger and finally it just got big enough until it fell off on the ground through intense struggle and activity.
[time=2328] Well I've never seen anything like that in my life and neither of you.
[time=2333] I can't imagine anybody being silly enough to go out in an orchard to watch an apple grow anyway. Can you stand there?
[time=2339] Well let's see I wonder how much it will grow today. Just stand there and watch it.
[time=2344] You see the principle of life is not what we so often confuse it for in the Christian realm.
[time=2350] We don't get the principles of the word of God that we see exhibited around us with the struggle and the toil and the stress and the activity and the driving and all of the natural energies that are a part of the energy of the family.
[time=2362] The Bible says that if we are going to be successful in the realm of the spiritual it won't be like it is in the realm of the natural.
[time=2371] For success in the realm of the spiritual is a quality of life called abiding.
[time=2379] In fact nine times in the seven verses we are told that if we're to be successful we need to abide in Christ.
[time=2389] Now what does that mean? What does it mean to abide in Christ?
[time=2395] Well there's two aspects of it. There's the active part that says if we abide in Christ that's our part of it and then there's the passive part.
[time=2404] If he abides in us then we are into this whole realm of spiritual success that he's talking about.
[time=2413] I remember reading some time ago a book written by Ray Stedman who's the pastor of a church out in California in Palo Alto and he's got a book entitled The Secrets of the Spirit.
[time=2424] And he addresses this subject of abiding and he says that when we are abiding in Christ what we're talking about is the will.
[time=2432] We're talking about our choices and our decisions. We are deciding to do things that expose ourselves to God and we're keeping ourselves in contact with him through the Word of God and through prayer and through fellowship with his people.
[time=2446] We are living within the realm of Jesus Christ and we are happy there. We are at home there and he is at home in us. He has come to dwell within us. The word abide means to be at home, to move in and be at home in our lives.
[time=2461] I know a lot of Christians who have Christ living within them but he doesn't seem to be much at home. He seems like sort of a stranger, sort of a foreigner. He's come to live within them but they don't make him feel too welcome.
[time=2476] Let me see if I can illustrate that. I've been in some homes in this vicinity where they didn't know I was coming.
[time=2484] It's surprising to me how many changes can take place in a few moments when the pastor is standing at the door.
[time=2491] I've been in Christian homes where people love the Lord and serve him and their lives are in touch with him and in tune with him and I walk in and I'm just right at home.
[time=2502] I've been in some other homes where people claim to be Christians where they've got things hanging on the walls that ought not to be there.
[time=2510] They've got magazines on the table that shouldn't be there. They've got things going on in the home that shouldn't go on there.
[time=2520] And you know what happens when I go into a home like that? I try to be comfortable and settle down and really be at home but it just doesn't quite fit.
[time=2528] And you know what else I discover? They're not comfortable either. I'm not at home there and they're not at home with having me there.
[time=2537] When we abide in Christ men and women, it means that we are so at home with the principles of the Word of God and with the person of Jesus Christ that we are relaxed with his presence in our life.
[time=2550] And we are at home with him because we sense he is at home with us when we are abiding in him, when we are living within the sphere of Jesus Christ.
[time=2562] And it's a real encouragement to me as a pastor to remember that when we abide in him we do it unconsciously many times.
[time=2573] Just like our body is asleep but the food is abiding in us and the process is going on even while we're sleeping, we're not conscious of it.
[time=2583] If we really come to grips with the principle of abiding in Christ and being at home with him and him with us, just a natural thing that goes on all the time.
[time=2591] And the Scripture says that when we abide like that and he abides in us then we will have this fruit coming out of our lives who will be reproducing ourselves.
[time=2600] Now I know what your thoughts are because I've been there so many times, you're saying okay.
[time=2606] Another principle of success that's so nebulous you can't really understand it.
[time=2610] So you go home and you say well I guess I need to abide, I wonder what that means.
[time=2615] How does a person abide in Christ?
[time=2618] Well I want us to get a handle on that this morning and I think this passage of Scripture really does that for us.
[time=2624] I'd like to talk for you for a few moments on the true vine and the secrets of new life.
[time=2629] How do we get to be at home with God and him at home with us?
[time=2634] And there are several secrets that are given to us and they're open secrets because they're right here in the text.
[time=2639] And the first one is this, it's the secret of pruning.
[time=2644] I want you to notice what it says in verse 6.
[time=2646] If a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they're burned.
[time=2658] What does that mean?
[time=2663] Well we often have a struggle with that passage of Scripture we say there, there it says right there you can get lost after you've been saved.
[time=2670] But please note he's not talking about salvation, he's talking about fruitfulness.
[time=2675] And it's interesting as you study this text that there are a couple of things that don't naturally normally appear as you unfold it.
[time=2681] First of all he is talking in verse 6 when he says cast forth, he's not talking about throwing out the word in the text as the word "Iro" and there are four meanings for that word.
[time=2691] Only one of them can be translated cast forth. The other three meanings mean to lift up.
[time=2698] And I pondered that this week and I really believe what the Savior is talking about here is this.
[time=2703] If you walk out into a vineyard where grapes are growing you discover even without much sense of horticulture that grapes do not flourish
[time=2710] when they're on the ground. Have you ever been in a vineyard and noticed that sometimes they have little poles and strings and they've tied the vineyards up so that the grapes can hang down freely?
[time=2722] For you see that kind of fruit does not grow and does not flourish unless there's a certain level of freedom so that it can develop.
[time=2731] And so a vine dresser will go out and if the grapes and if the fruit are heavy and have drugged the vines down to the ground he will lift up the fruit.
[time=2741] And the text is actually saying I believe in verse 6 that if a man is not abiding in Christ, if he has not yet come to the place where Christ is at home in him and he is at home in Christ,
[time=2752] that the vine dresser comes along and he lifts up the fruit. He draws it up and it's a beautiful picture of being drawn up closer to the Lord and being drawn into the fellowship of the Lord.
[time=2763] Now notice the second part of that is that he prunes it or he purges it in the word there is the word cathorizo.
[time=2769] It means to cleanse it's the word from which we get our word catharsis, a cleansing.
[time=2775] And the picture is that the Lord who is the vine dresser who is trying to cause us to be successful walks among his vineyard, walks among his church and he sees over here a person who has not yet come to the place of abiding and trusting and resting in him.
[time=2790] And he does everything that is possible to lift him up in devotion to the Lord and then in the lifting up there is a pruning out.
[time=2800] Please understand that the sequence of these two events is critical.
[time=2804] I have been and you have been in circles where people feel like when a person becomes a Christian, the first thing you do is you prune out before you lift up.
[time=2813] Have you ever seen that? Somebody gets saved and some dear Christian saint gets them off in the pew in the back of the church and says now that you're a Christian here are forty things you can't do anymore.
[time=2823] And they start pruning and pretty soon the Christian says hey, what's wrong with that?
[time=2830] The problem with that is it violates the scripture but pragmatically the problem with it is this.
[time=2836] God's process of pruning so that we might abide in him is the right way because as we are drawn closer to the Lord the things of the world are pruned out of our lives almost without our knowledge of it.
[time=2851] I've often said when you become a Christian and you get under the word of God and you begin to study the scripture you discover along the way that those old habits and those old things that keep Christ from being at home when your life start to fall off your life like barnacles off a ship.
[time=2867] Perhaps another illustration will help.
[time=2870] My daughter will be after me for doing this but I won't do it anyway.
[time=2876] Do you know those of you who have had daughters? Can you remember the day when your daughter made the decision to give up dolls?
[time=2885] Mom and Dad I've been thinking a lot about the growth of my life and my maturity.
[time=2891] After much consideration I've considered very appropriate that I give up dolls.
[time=2897] That doesn't happen that way at all does it? I don't know when she gave up dolls.
[time=2902] Some time along the way when she found out there was another kind of doll beside the one she was praying with.
[time=2909] All of a sudden the dolls aren't there anymore.
[time=2914] Did she give up the dolls and know the dolls gave her up?
[time=2918] She got excited about something more important and all of a sudden those other things weren't important anymore.
[time=2925] That is how God prunes His children and if we ever try to force it into any other mold we violate the principle of the word of God
[time=2934] and it is my impression that's why we've got a lot of Christians who are aborted somewhere along the way in their growth process
[time=2941] because someone has stripped them clean before they've ever been brought into a fellowship and one is with a father that will replace that vacuum in their life that has been created.
[time=2952] He purges. Boy I don't like the purging do you?
[time=2957] I think an Old Testament illustration is good. Some folks feel like this teaches that you lose your salvation.
[time=2963] Do you remember a lot in the Old Testament? Do you remember when Lot got purged?
[time=2969] He went down there in that city of Sodom and he sowed his works down there.
[time=2974] We have no knowledge that Lot participated in all of the homosexuality and sin of that city.
[time=2980] But he worked in that city. You know what happened to him one day?
[time=2984] God purged him. He cast his works into the fire didn't he?
[time=2990] And he burned up everything Lot had been doing for all of those years and here we see Lot. He saved yet so as by fire.
[time=2999] He walked out of there with two daughters and he left all of his works back in that city and God just burned them up like that.
[time=3009] The secret of pruning. I ll tell you what, when God wants you to become a part of him and when he wants to come to the place where he s at home in your life.
[time=3020] Do you know what he does? He takes out of your life the things that make him uncomfortable.
[time=3026] Has he been doing that with you? Has he been working that way in your life? Pruning.
[time=3031] Now notice the second secret is the secret of obeying the word. Notice verse three.
[time=3038] Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. How does he purge us?
[time=3043] He purges us through the word of God. Verse ten. If you keep my commandments you will abide in my love even as I have kept my father s commandments and abide in his love.
[time=3053] The second secret of abiding in Christ is the word of God. Obeying the word of God. How does he cleanse us? We ll ask David.
[time=3060] David said where with all shall a young man cleans his way? Here s the answer by taking heed there too according to thy word. Thy word if I hid in my heart.
[time=3068] The word of God is the cleansing agent in the Christian life. When God gets the vine up here like this he comes to dress it and to cleanse it.
[time=3076] How does he cleanse it? He cleanses it with his word. You say pastor how does that work? Well I can t answer that for you but I ll tell you how it works for me.
[time=3083] Oftentimes when I m studying the scripture many times when I m preparing a message I ll come to grips with the truth of the word of God and have to stop and say Lord.
[time=3093] Wow. You really stung me this time. I didn t realize I was so far out of phase with what your will is in my life.
[time=3104] When I see what you say that I m supposed to be in your word and when I see what I am, I want to cry out to God for forgiveness and confession that my life might be brought into phase with God s word.
[time=3120] That s the cleansing process of the word of God. Obeying God s word brings us into phase with God s will for our lives.
[time=3130] And then in verse 7 we have the secret of praying. If you ll bite in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you.
[time=3142] The three secrets pruning, obeying the word, and praying. Now let me say something about prayer.
[time=3150] I would imagine that many of you folks have related to prayer and some of the ways that I have in the past. I have thought in the past that praying was a means by which I could get God to change his mind about me or my circumstances.
[time=3168] O God, take care of this problem. O God, meet this need. You know what I ve been learning? That isn t the way it works at all. The purpose of prayer is not to change God. The purpose of prayer is to change me.
[time=3184] And that s why this passage of Scripture can say that if we ask anything abiding in him it shall be done unto us. You say, Pastor, I ve asked God for things and it hasn t been done, but you missed the important part.
[time=3200] You see, if I am at home with Christ and He is at home with me I will never ask anything that is out of the will of my Savior.
[time=3210] My prayer will always be not my will be done, but thine. Lord, I want to be brought into phase with your will so that I might continue to abide in your will and be at home in your will so that you might be at home in my life.
[time=3224] And so the more I read the Word of God and the more the pruning process takes place in my life, the more I ask God for those things which I already know please him and I discover that they are fulfilled in my life.
[time=3236] And my prayers are answered. As the Savior in the Garden of Gethsemane, not my will, but thine be done. Prayer is not for the purpose of changing God. Prayers for the purpose of changing me, and you know what folks? That s the reason we don t pray.
[time=3254] Because prayer is painful. Prayer causes us to come into phase with God, and that means we have to give up our own will that His will might be supreme within us.
[time=3266] And so we don t pray because it s hard work and it s painful and we don t like what it does to us.
[time=3272] But you see, the secret of being successful in the Christian life is simple, abide, but the principles of abiding demand some intensity on our part, the pruning process, the obeying process, and the praying process.
[time=3294] And unfortunately far too many Christians go through their lives trying to reproduce outwardly a fake kind of fruit that comes in a false way instead of working at the principles of the Word of God which He has promised to bless in our lives.
[time=3319] And we give the appearance of being fruitful, but there s a dearth in our own soul and a vacuum where God should be.
[time=3329] I believe with all of my heart that God wants us to be successful as Christians, that He wants you to know the joy of success in terms of the Word of God, but friend, there is no way to do it apart from God s way.
[time=3346] And the words of a great book, when all else fails, read the directions.
[time=3355] Shall we pray?
[time=3362] Our heads bowed, and our eyes closed as we close this hour together, first of all, to speak to those of you who are watching by television.
[time=3371] If you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you cannot abide in Him nor He in you.
[time=3377] And I ask you today to let Him in the door of your life so that He can start the process of becoming at home in your life.
[time=3387] Simply to say today, Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, that I cannot save myself, and so this hour, this day, I invite you into my life and into my heart to be my Savior.
[time=3400] I accept you because I want you to be my own.
[time=3405] And when you do that, He will come in and forgive your sin and give you life everlasting.
[time=3410] Do it today. Do it right now. You will never be sorry that you have led Him into your life.
[time=3416] And if you make that decision, let us know so that we can send you some material that will help you to grow and learn what it means to abide in Him.
