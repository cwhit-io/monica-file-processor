[time=0] we're happy to welcome you here today first of all all of you who have joined us in the auditorium for our second service and then secondly all of you who have joined us by way of television we call the television program the bible hour and it is because of that purpose that it is
[time=17] distinct from many programs that are available to people through television we major on the word
[time=23] of god the choir is chosen to sing as we begin our service today a song that reminds us that the
[time=30] bible is the one sure thing that stands when everything else crumbles and it is good to know that when we base our doctrine and our practice and our lives upon this book it will endure
[time=41] throughout the ages please listen to the music and to the melody as the choir sings
[time=71] the bible stands on the wheels thanks a whole it will firmly stand with the earth shall crumble
[time=98] by the blood my feet on its hand foundation for the bible stands the bible stands and it will forever
[time=114] when the world has passed away
[time=144] and the bible stands every day we give it for it's all there is divine by grace all of my experience and in the letter prove it and make it
[time=174] by the bible stands and it will stand with the earth shall crumble by the blood my feet on its
[time=190] fair foundation for the bible stands the bible stands
[time=216] that is a good introduction to our next guest a few weeks ago we had the privilege of participating in a missions project that made it possible for us to send 4,000 bibles to a ketos parub where one of our missionaries Dan Smith and his wife Judy are serving the Lord along the Amazon we received word recently by shortwave radio that the bible has finally arrived and they're using them in the work of the gospel along the river there as they minister to the native
[time=246] in those villages we're so very grateful that we had a part in sharing that and many of you who give here and many through television had a part in that missionary project we were able to get those bibles in the right language because of an organization called Bibles for the world the organization is something that grew out of the life of a man by the name of Rotchunga Padaidi he was a member of a head hunting crew that
[time=275] heard the gospel and accepted Christ as his savior and literally climbed his way out of that culture and that climb to ultimately come here to the states and found this organization which is being used of God to send Bibles all over the world when we worked with these people to get these
[time=295] bibles it was my privilege to meet him he goes affectionately by the name of a row and we ask him if someday he would come back and give his testimony to our church and he is here today to do that I hope you will help him feel welcome as he comes to share with us what God has done in his life Rotchunga Padaidi
[time=323] thank you in the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 11 we read cast thy bread upon the waters and thou shall
[time=332] find it after many days and then in the book of Isaiah we read my words shall not return unto me void
[time=343] we have the promise of God that the Bible the book that we declare as the wood of God is full
[time=351] of living power in 1910 one single copy of the gospel of john came into my village
[time=360] which was then a head hunting village as a result of that one single copy of the gospel of john
[time=367] my father became a believer in Jesus Christ even though we did not have the privilege of having
[time=375] missionaries like many other tribes God began to work through his own word in the hearts of my father
[time=384] and others who later on come to know Jesus Christ as a savior and today out of the tribe of 100,000
[time=392] practically all of them have become believers in Jesus Christ it began with just one single copy
[time=402] of the gospel of john i received the lord Jesus Christ as my own personal savior at the age of 10
[time=411] through the ministry of my father soon after that my father and mother pray that i may go to school
[time=418] in order to translate the bible into the language of my own people and i travel a distance of 96 miles
[time=426] back and forth through thick jungle forest infested by tigers and elephants and rhinos and bears
[time=434] and god taught me through those experiences the power and the joy of owning the scripture
[time=442] with you and as a result of that god has allowed me now to be involved in a program of sharing the
[time=450] word of god to the ends of the world and last year alone we mailed over two million bibles
[time=456] throughout the world and the word of god full of living power is now going out in the languages
[time=463] of the people and i just want to demonstrate to you how simple it is to send these bibles you
[time=470] place these beautiful book in the center of these wrapper and you bring it to the center and you
[time=476] press it together and then down at the center again you press both and and you have one bible
[time=483] pack to be mailed to somebody who may never own a bible in his language and so you put 83 cents
[time=491] then and then these bible is on his way to somewhere in foreign land it is my prayer that
[time=499] throughout the united states and around the world that christians will begin to be involved in giving the word of god for this is the greatest message that god get to man
[time=510] it has the power of life it has the only soul saving message written in the book thank you god bless you
[time=518] all thank you doctor pedide the word of god is the sure foundation to build a life on
[time=537] when a life is built upon the word of god all exaltation goes to god himself through jesus christ
[time=544] listen now is the black hawk singers lift up the lord with the song crown him with many crowns
[time=574] almighty crowns almighty crowns almighty crowns all music but it's all oh wait my soul and sing of him who died for day and came as life
[time=604] match let's get through all eternity now you will learn a life who is right after the grave
[time=626] who rose victorious in the strife for those who seem to sing his glory is now we sing
[time=641] who died and rose on high who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die
[time=656] oh
[time=734] we're so happy that you've joined us today i'm sorry that donna could not be with us for this
[time=742] particular time she normally shares this hour with us as we talk together she is home today and is not able to be here but i'm glad to have this chance to just share with you some of the things which god has been doing here at the bible hour and to extend to you an opportunity to be involved
[time=758] in the bible hour ministry through the reception of some literature that i know will be of help to you several months ago we put together a little booklet called the answer book it was the result
[time=769] of many questions that came to us through the mail on various and sundry subjects questions asking for the scripture verse that dealt with a particular topic for instance where can i find
[time=780] what the bible says on the subject of the peace of god or how can i determine what god has to say
[time=786] about guilt or about sorrow or about sadness and suffering we began to write letters back to our
[time=792] friends giving them all of the verses of scripture and decided ultimately that it would be a tremendous
[time=798] help if we could put these key passages in one little booklet that we could make available to all of our television friends absolutely free and so we came up with the idea of the answer book
[time=810] it is simply a book filled with scripture verses that are topically arranged so that as you look through it you can quickly find the verses scripture that you need for whatever situation is yours we'd like to send this very helpful little booklet to you if you'll just get

[time=942] normally at this point in time we take the offering and we should have taken it five minutes
[time=952] ago and we didn't do it and we don't usually take it on the air we usually take care of that while
[time=959] don and i are talking to the folks at home on television and i haven't figured out yet a creative way
[time=965] to produce the offering on the air but i do need to ask the ushers to come forward so that we can at least have a try because it's very important that we take an offering and we really did appreciate
[time=976] star narwhal solo we appreciated it so much we're going to listen to it again and uh let's just pray together and then star you saying let's take the offering and you really
[time=987] ought to do it well this time after practicing it once right okay lord in heaven we thank you
[time=993] for the privilege of giving we ask that you will take our gifts and our offerings and cause them to be used even as we have heard today from dr podiety to spread the gospel we're overwhelmed at the power
[time=1005] of one copy of god's word not only could it cause a man to come to faith in christ but cause his family
[time=1013] to come to faith in christ and then lord to be used of god to start a movement like bibles for
[time=1019] the world that has been used to literally spread thy word all over this globe we know that when we
[time=1025] give as unto thee that that money is used for that purpose and we thank you bless our gifts as we
[time=1031] give to thee and bless us star shares with us this song in jesus name amen
[time=1060] when jesus comes again he'll take me by the hand i'll leave this world behind and heaven i will
[time=1077] find my troubles will be gone i'll sing a brand new song my weakness will be strong with jesus
[time=1107] oh my body will be home and i will not grow old i'll see my friends i'm told
[time=1121] by the point i will know christ treasures i will own i'll kneel before god's throne
[time=1136] christ is the way for me to live eternally
[time=1152] he died to set me free his gift that i've received and when he comes again he'll take me by the
[time=1168] hand i'll leave this world behind and heaven i will find and heaven i will find
[time=1199] thank you star that was worth here and twice wasn't it amen open your bibles if you please
[time=1207] to the fifth chapter of john's gospel john chapter five and i want to read together verses 25 through 29 i would appreciate it very much if you would
[time=1220] read with me so have your bibles open and we'll stand together in just a moment and read out loud
[time=1227] these verses john chapter five verses 25 through 29 all right let's stand shall we please
[time=1233] everyone reading aloud barely barely i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall
[time=1247] hear the voice of the son of god and they that here shall live for as the father hath life in himself
[time=1256] so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and have given him authority to execute judgment
[time=1265] also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in
[time=1274] the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of
[time=1283] life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation shall we pray
[time=1290] our father we read in thy word that he that hath the son hath life we're grateful for the life
[time=1300] which we have in jesus christ a life that the world knows nothing about but a life that is
[time=1307] available to everyone who will come by faith to receive christ and having received the son
[time=1313] to receive life everlasting we thank you for this portion of thy word that unfolds for us two kinds
[time=1319] of resurrections both of which are important for us to understand and we do pray that you will give
[time=1325] us understanding into this portion of thy word today that our minds and hearts might be illumined and that our lives might be encouraged that we would go from this place to put into practice
[time=1336] that which comes upon us from the holy spirit's influence in our lives during this moment
[time=1343] we might go out to live for thee in a different way we pray in jesus name and for his sake amen
[time=1349] there was a doctor in london who had as his deepest desire to win his page boy to christ
[time=1366] he tried every way he knew how to help him understand the importance of coming to christ as savior finally one night the doctor explained to him that there was coming a day in the future when the
[time=1377] lord was going to come back to earth he read to him from first thessalonians chapter four where
[time=1383] we read that the lord himself shall descend and he ended the recital of that verse by turning to his
[time=1390] young friend and saying to him john when the lord comes you can have my home
[time=1397] that didn't seem to phase him too much he said john when the lord comes back you can have my car
[time=1405] too now that got his attention and he said john along with that i'm going to give you all my money
[time=1411] everything i have i'm i'm going to leave to you when the lord comes to get his own and we're raptured you can have it all well the boy was pretty excited about that and he he thought this was a great thing he'd gotten into until he went home that night and he went to bed and he began to think it all through and he he realized that something was wrong with his reasoning to be happy about such series of events and he began to ask himself some questions well if the doctor goes to be with the lord and i'm here what good are all those things going to do me here i'm missing
[time=1441] out on the most important that's what he's been trying to tell me all this time that someday the lord's coming back and he's going to receive unto himself his own he was so moved by this that he
[time=1451] got in touch with the doctor even in the middle of the night and as the story is told he came to christ as his personal savior the truth of the word of god and it is here illustrated for us in this great passage of scripture is that everyone no matter who they are are going to be resurrected
[time=1469] the bible says that someday in the future every single person is going to come out of the grave the only exception to that are those who happen to be alive when the resurrection occurs those
[time=1480] who will go up in the rapture once in a while i hear christians say well you know you christians believe there's going to be a i'm sure you're going to be resurrected someday but that's not that stuff's not for me well the problem is it's for you whether you like it or not the bible says
[time=1494] every single person will be resurrected from the grave one day god the sun is going to say
[time=1500] everybody out of the grave and they're all going to come out and depending on where you are in
[time=1506] your relationship with jesus christ the time of your coming out of the grave will be determined now the emphasis of the passage which we have read this morning is this that the person who gives
[time=1517] life to the dead the one who causes life to come upon that which is dead the person is jesus christ
[time=1524] he alone has the power to give life notice back in the fifth chapter in verse 21 as the father
[time=1530] raises up the dead and giveth life to them even so the son giveth life to whom he will
[time=1537] jesus christ is the life giver of the universe notice verse 24 verily verily i say unto you he
[time=1544] that hereth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life how do you get everlasting
[time=1552] life you get it from one place and one place only the person of the lord jesus christ now john has been teaching us that jesus christ is god and this truth about him being the life giver
[time=1563] is just another plank in the platform of his deity it is simply another way for john to teach us
[time=1569] through recording the words of jesus that jesus christ is the very god of gods and that only god
[time=1576] can give life and therefore if jesus gives life he must be god and that's what jesus claims for
[time=1582] himself and that's what the bible says about him now interestingly enough in this passage of scripture there are two kinds of resurrections in fact the title of today's message is the two
[time=1594] resurrections most of the time when people expound this passage of scripture they look at it as if
[time=1600] it refers to that time in the future when the resurrection of the dead shall take place but i
[time=1606] want you to notice that in this portion of god's word we have both a physical resurrection and a
[time=1612] spiritual resurrection and the spiritual resurrection comes first in the text notice
[time=1618] verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice
[time=1624] of the son of god and they that here shall live now jesus introduces this portion of his teaching
[time=1632] with the phrase verily verily whenever you see that in the word of god you better sit up and take notice because it means this is especially important this is a very special truth
[time=1644] i say unto you listen carefully because this is important three times in this chapter those words are used you will notice them down in verse 19 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you
[time=1656] the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeeth the father it is also in verse 24 which we just
[time=1663] read verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and now here in this portion we have it again verily verily i say unto you the
[time=1675] hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of god and shall live now this particular
[time=1683] verse does not refer to the resurrection from the dead and let me show you why who is coming out in
[time=1689] this resurrection who is being resurrected well it says that the dead are being resurrected and when are they being resurrected well jesus says they're being resurrected in the future
[time=1701] and right now now let me ask you a question are any dead being resurrected right now i don't know of any i hear some preposterous claims on occasion but the dead are not being
[time=1713] resurrected by christ now that's in the future but jesus said this is the hour of resurrection and
[time=1720] what could he be referring to the only answer is he is talking about spiritual resurrection
[time=1726] he is telling us that this is not a literal bodily resurrection but this is a resurrection
[time=1732] of the souls which are dead in sins and in trespasses he is saying that resurrection is
[time=1740] happening now since he came into the world when jesus christ came into the world he came in to give life he's the great life giver as soon as he came into the world he started giving life to those who would believe in him and he says it's going to continue the hour is now and it shall be in the future after the day of penny cost that life giving ministry just exploded and the church
[time=1760] was born and men and women were born into the family of god in not just one at a time but many hundreds at a time but jesus here is claiming that he has the power to give spiritual life where
[time=1771] there is deadness and as we have studied the book of john have we not seen illustration after
[time=1777] illustration of that truth remember the paralytic at the pool and jesus healed him after being 38
[time=1785] years in firm and the issue wasn't his physical healing that was great but the real issue was
[time=1791] his spiritual healing god the son gave him life and he became new born and he became a christian
[time=1798] and then the savior and the senator's son which is another miracle that we studied and do you remember how that man came and planned for the life of his son and jesus told him to go
[time=1809] home that his son was well and when he got home he found that his son had been healed at the same hour but more important than that it says in the text that he believed and his whole household believed every one of them now most people when they read that story say that the most important thing that happened was that that little boy was healed but that's not the most important thing that little boy was healed that's true but more important than that was the fact that that whole family found life in jesus christ because jesus christ is the great life giver just a couple of weeks ago we studied the woman at the well who jesus met and and she came out of
[time=1844] psychar to get water and jesus told her about the water that would cause her never again to thirst and the scripture says that she believed and she got life and then there were those men who came out of psychar when the disciples were there and the bible tells us that they received life you see jesus christ is in the business of raising the dead and he's doing it right now and i'm
[time=1866] talking about the spiritually dead sometimes people don't understand that if you don't know
[time=1873] christ you're dead you're dead every single person was born into the world dead
[time=1880] now that's a strange comment to make but it's true every person whoever was born into this world
[time=1887] was born into this world dead obviously not physically dead they were born into this world
[time=1893] spiritually dead and what do we mean by that over and over again in the new testament we're told that apart from christ we are dead in sins and in trespasses in the book of Matthew the
[time=1905] lord jesus said to a man one day who refused to follow him because his father was still living and he was going to bury him jesus said to him let the dead bury their dead he's talking about the spiritually dead let them take care of their own dead and in the story of the prodigal son the
[time=1920] father said when his son came home this my son was dead and he lived it what does he mean
[time=1926] well we don't talk about death too much it's not a very popular subject but if i could risk
[time=1933] being a little bit uh irreverent about that subject let me just mention to you that if you
[time=1939] ever are around something that's dead if you're around a dead body you discover immediately that that body does no longer responds to the stimuli in the physical realm go up and poke the body with
[time=1953] a pin you better hope nothing happens because something that's dead doesn't have the ability
[time=1959] to respond it is lost its its ability to respond to the environment in which it lives what it means
[time=1967] to be dead spiritually is this a person who is dead spiritually is incapable of responding in the
[time=1974] spiritual realm of his life he cannot understand the word of god it means nothing to him he is not
[time=1980] sensitive to the spirit of god it is just like sticking a pin in a dead corpse he cannot respond
[time=1986] to the people of god he cannot respond to the preaching of god the only way that response can
[time=1992] start within him is if god in heaven through his son jesus christ gives him life so that he can come
[time=1999] alive spiritually and begin to respond to this whole area of the spiritual realm in which he lives and it's interesting to me in the book of john especially in these passages that we have been
[time=2010] studying recently that over and over and over again we are told that the purpose of jesus christ and
[time=2016] his ministry is that he might give life just look through some of these passages with me first of
[time=2022] all john five and verse 40 and he will not come to me that she might have life look at john chapter
[time=2030] six and verse 27 labor not for the food which perisheth but for the food which endureth unto
[time=2037] everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed notice
[time=2043] verse 33 for the bread of god is he who comes down from heaven and he gives life unto the world
[time=2051] notice verse 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never
[time=2058] hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst verse 35 then notice verse 68 then simon
[time=2064] peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life over and over again
[time=2072] in this book called the gospel of john we see jesus christ as the great life giver in chapter 10 verse
[time=2079] 10 he said i am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly in john
[time=2085] chapter 14 verse 6 he said i am the way the truth and the life no man come with unto the father
[time=2094] but by me in the great chapter on the resurrection of lasarus jesus said i am the resurrection and
[time=2101] the life men and women what jesus is teaching us in this passage of scripture is that he is the great life giver that this world is filled with those who are dead spiritually and they're looking
[time=2112] for life in every direction seeking it here and there in this culture and that ism in this environment
[time=2119] or in that environment in this pursuit or that pursuit but they will never find life until jesus
[time=2125] christ comes into their life and opens them up toward heaven and creates within them the ability
[time=2131] to respond to the spiritual stimuli of the spiritual universe jesus christ is the great
[time=2137] life giver and it's a beautiful thing to think about it in this way that the world is filled with dead people picture in your mind this spiritual truth in the physical
[time=2153] realm the whole earth covered with dead bodies every body dead laying on the ground
[time=2161] and jesus walks into the world and he walks in the midst of the dead and he says to that one come
[time=2169] forth and that one come forth and this one have life and this one be resurrected and one after another he touches the dead around him and they come to life in jesus christ
[time=2181] and in the spiritual realm that's exactly what happens one day jesus speaks to your heart and he
[time=2187] says i am the way the truth and the life and for the first time it makes sense and you respond how does that happen he gives you the life he gives you the ability to believe that's interesting that it says in this passage of scripture
[time=2206] that when jesus calls and when his voice is heard they live now wait just a moment
[time=2213] the bible teaches us that the dead hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live
[time=2220] and yet we look around us in our culture today and in our churches and in our environment and we say many are hearing the voice of god through the preaching of the word of god and through the teaching of the word of god through radio and television and all of the other opportunities for the voice of god to be heard in today's world they're hearing but i don't see any result to that they don't seem to be living i want you to notice that there are two ways to hear you remember as you read the bible quite often in the new testament you will come upon this little
[time=2247] phrase he that hath ears to hear let him hear do you know when you take that just all by itself
[time=2254] that's the silliest statement you ever heard in your life isn't it i mean after all if you've got ears to hear what else are you going to do with them but here what is he saying when he says to us if you've got ears to hear hear he is saying that it is possible to hear physically but not
[time=2270] to hear in your heart it's possible for you to have the auditory canal filled with sound but it doesn't
[time=2277] make any difference because the truth doesn't come through the hearing process into your being to make a difference and when he says in this passage of scripture that they who hear he's talking about
[time=2288] that second kind of hearing that goes beyond the ears and gets down into the system and translates into spiritual renewal and spiritual birth he that hath ears to hear let him hear
[time=2302] now i want you to note in this passage of scripture that jesus christ alone is the one who has the
[time=2310] power and the ability to make that happen there's an interesting play on words in verses 21 and verse
[time=2317] 26 verse 21 says for as the father raiseeth up the dead and giveth life to them even so the son
[time=2327] giveth life to whom he will now notice verse 26 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he
[time=2335] given to the son to have life in himself verse 26 talks about having life verse 21 talks about
[time=2343] giving life verse 26 says jesus christ is life verse 21 says jesus christ gives life and the obvious
[time=2351] truth is this you cannot impart what you do not possess if jesus christ is not life then jesus christ
[time=2359] cannot impart life but over and over again in this passage of scripture he claims not to be just
[time=2365] the giver of life he claims to be life itself and that is why he is the only source of life in our
[time=2372] world today there is no other person who ever lived or walked upon this earth who can claim
[time=2378] to be life as jesus is life many try to claim it many hold up the standard of life but it is
[time=2385] filled with deadness jesus alone has the power of spiritual resurrection
[time=2391] so we see in these first two verses that jesus is talking about a time when spiritual
[time=2399] resurrection will take place now before we look at the second kind of resurrection let me ask you a
[time=2405] question he says in this passage of scripture behold the hour is coming and the hour now is
[time=2413] when the dead shall hear and shall be resurrected to life how long is that hour why it started when
[time=2421] jesus came into the world and is it not true that spiritual resurrection is still happening today
[time=2427] this week some of you maybe have had the experience of being resurrected spiritual you came to know christ is your savior the hour which jesus is talking about that now is and is coming is an hour that at least in this realm has lasted for over 1900 years for when jesus came he instituted
[time=2445] the hour of spiritual resurrection and it continues right on until today and it will continue on
[time=2451] until the lord comes for his own here is an hour that's 1900 years long now just stick that in your
[time=2457] mind because that'll be important to us in a moment notice secondly not spiritual resurrection but
[time=2463] physical resurrection in verse 28 the lord switches gears now as he's talking to these folks and he
[time=2471] says marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice
[time=2478] and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now who are the people involved in this second physical
[time=2490] resurrection i mentioned at the outset of the message today that every single person will be
[time=2496] resurrected you're going to be resurrected whether unto life or unto damnation if you aren't alive
[time=2502] as a christian when christ comes back for his own you'll be resurrected there is no hiding in the grave from the almighty god some folks teach that if you don't accept christ you just go to the grave and you die like an animal and you're never heard from the doctrine of annihilation the bible doesn't teach that the bible says every single person has eternal life of one kind or another
[time=2522] it's either eternal life with god in heaven or it's eternal life in hell with satan and his angels under what the bible speaks of as damnation and condemnation now when you first read this passage
[time=2534] of scripture if you don't understand what's going on you can get the impression that jesus is teaching
[time=2540] the doctrine of a general resurrection he is saying here the hour is coming when some are going to be
[time=2547] resurrected to life and some resurrected to damnation and you get the impression when you read the text that it's all happening at the same time i want you to notice that that's not what's going on at
[time=2557] all perhaps a bit of review as to what happens when a person dies will help set the stage for our
[time=2565] understanding over and over again in the ministry here in the years that we've been here folks have
[time=2571] come at one time or another and said to us pastor what happens to a person when they die what really
[time=2577] happens i'm confused you know i hear people talking about the lord coming back to get us and other people talking about us going into grave and man it's confusing well what does happen when a person
[time=2586] dies listen carefully when a christian dies paul said absent from the body is present with the
[time=2594] lord immediately when a christian dies his soul spirit his spiritual being the real hymn that lives
[time=2602] inside his house goes into the presence of the lord in paradise to be with the lord in a place
[time=2608] that is heaven-like awaiting the ultimate heaven what happens to his body well last i knew they
[time=2615] put him in a casket and put him in the grave in the ground all right what happens to an unbeliever
[time=2621] well when an unbeliever dies the bible says that his spirit soul his real person goes to shiho
[time=2628] Hades the place that awaits for the final consignment to the lake of fire
[time=2634] what happens to his body it goes into grave so here we have this picture of a person dies and
[time=2640] there are two alternatives if he's a christian his body goes into the grave his soul goes to be with the lord if he's an unsaved person his body goes into grave and his soul goes into shiho a place of torment like unto hell awaiting for final consignment now let's go back again to the hour how long did the first hour last in spiritual resurrection
[time=2663] from the time christ came into the world at least enough up until now how long is that 1900 years
[time=2669] now notice the second hour in this passage marvel not at this for the hour is coming notice he
[time=2675] doesn't say the hour now is here for there's anything going on now like what's going to go on out there this is not the hour for today this is the hour of the future he says the hour is coming in which all
[time=2688] that are in their graves shall hear his voice and the bible takes this by way of progressive
[time=2699] revelation and teaches us in the rest of the new testament how that happens now let me tell you how it happens the christian the believer's resurrection is in three parts do you know what they are
[time=2710] the first part is the resurrection of jesus christ the bible says in first carrinthians now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept the first part
[time=2721] of the believer's resurrection is when christ came out of the grave on easter sunday what's the
[time=2727] second part well the second part of the resurrection is in first thessalonians four when the dead in christ shall be raised first i've always laughed a little bit with a little girl who explained the fact that they were going to be raised first before those who are alive and remain are caught up together to be with the lord she said they have to be raised first because they've got six feet further to go and maybe she's right but we know secondly that the dead in christ are raised at the
[time=2754] rapture that's the second phase of the of the of the believers resurrection what's the third this is the one you probably don't know about it slips by you pretty quickly all of the old testament christians that lived in old testament times and all of those who are saved during the tribulation period are resurrected at the end of the seven-year tribulation period so there are three phases to
[time=2776] the believer's resurrection christ the first fruits the rapture and the resurrection of all of the old testament saints and the tribulation saints at the end of the seven-year period all right now what about the unbelievers where do they come out of the grave well the bible says that the unbelievers are resurrected at the end of the kingdom age the
[time=2795] millennium do you know what that word means it means one thousand at the end of the thousand year reign of christ the unsaved dead will be resurrected all in one time there are no
[time=2806] three phases for the unsaved dead they all come out of the grave at the old testament tribulation all of those who are all who are unsaved come out of the grave at the same time how many years are there between the sections of the resurrection well there's at least a thousand
[time=2821] years between the final phase of the believer's resurrection and the unbelievers resurrection it's that thousand year period call the millennium you say pastor how can you understand that in this
[time=2831] text it says the hour is coming well if there's a 1900 year hour in the first verse why can't there
[time=2837] be at least a one thousand year hour in the last verse we know from all of the scripture that the resurrections don't come all at the same time for instance look chapter 13 verse 14 speaks of the
[time=2852] resurrection of the just a separate resurrection entirely from those who are unsaved first thessalonians
[time=2859] for which we've referred to already says that the dead in christ shall rise obviously that's a separate thing from any other kind of resurrection but i think the best scripture for us to learn
[time=2870] about this is in revelation chapter 20 so i want you to turn there revelation chapter 20
[time=2878] verses four and five and then we'll look at a couple of other verses in this great chapter the dead in christ and those who are alive but unsaved those who are dead but unsaved let's see
[time=2890] how it fits together chapter 20 of revelation verse five and i saw thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for
[time=2901] the witness of jesus and for the word of god and who had not worshipped the beast neither his image
[time=2907] neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and rained with
[time=2913] christ a thousand years here they are alive during the millennium now notice verse five but
[time=2919] what does it say the rest of the dead who is that those are the unbelievers but the rest of the
[time=2927] dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this referring to the first part of
[time=2933] this text is the first resurrection there are two resurrections the believer's resurrection and the unbelievers resurrection and he is saying that the dead who died outside of christ don't live until the thousand year reign is over and then they're resurrected now notice come down in revelation 20 to verses 11 the head of the last paragraph there we read in verse 11 of
[time=2956] revelation 20 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose faith the earth
[time=2963] and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great
[time=2969] stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now listen carefully the bible never teaches that every man who's going to die will someday
[time=2986] come before this great tribunal throne in heaven and they will stand before the judge and he will say you made it you go to the right you don't make it you go to the left there are two judgments in
[time=2996] heaven that correspond with the two resurrections that we're learning about the resurrection of the
[time=3002] believer causes the believer to be raptured and immediately after he is raptured and after he is
[time=3008] resurrected he goes before the lord at what they call the beam of seat or the judgment seat of christ that judgment is not to find out whether you get in or don't get in when you stand before the judgment seat of christ you're already in because you've trusted christ as your savior the bible
[time=3024] says the judgment seat of christ is to judge the works done in the flesh so you can get your reward nobody's going to be at the judgment seat of christ who isn't already absolutely certain of heaven
[time=3035] but just as surely as the first resurrection causes the first judgment the second resurrection
[time=3042] causes the second judgment now listen carefully no christian will ever stand before the white throne judgment of god when you stand before the white throne judgment of god you're already in deep trouble it's too late you don't have to stand before the white seat the white white
[time=3059] throne judgment of god to find out whether you're saved or not if you get before the white throne judgment you've participated in the second resurrection you're an unbeliever now notice what happens at that judgment and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened
[time=3075] and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their work some folks say well it isn't fair that i'd be judged as a sinner if i didn't understand a lot about jesus christ the bible says you're going to be judged by what you knew and what you didn't do with it you're going to be judged by the works that you do according to what you understood god is going to say all right if you don't want to be judged on the acceptance of my son jesus christ let's just see how you did on your own and he opens up the book of works and oh you're you're indicted because no man can live a
[time=3110] perfect life and that's the only way you can get into heaven now read on and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hell were delivered delivered up the dead that were in them this Hades is where these departed souls have been since the unbelievers died and they delivered up the dead that were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death there are two
[time=3140] resurrections there are two judgments and there are two deaths if you participate in the second resurrection you stand before the second judgment and you die the second death and it says and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
[time=3157] you see when you get before the white throne judgment you might feel like arguing with God I didn't have a chance it wasn't fair I didn't hear I the Lord will say let me let me just check you out here they'll open up the first book which is the book of your works and you'll say I find no good thing here all your righteousness is are as filthy rags but let me check again let's check
[time=3178] the book of life and he opens up the book of life and he says I'm sorry your name isn't there
[time=3186] depart from me I never knew you and the Bible says that the result of that is eternal damnation
[time=3193] yes I believe in a literal hell where a fire burns where the souls of those and the bodies of those
[time=3201] who have been resurrected unsaved people will be forever tormented apart from God what you see the whole purpose of what Jesus is saying is to point out that that doesn't have
[time=3212] to happen he said I am the life you're dead you're dead spiritually and if you stay dead spiritually
[time=3220] and you die then physically as a spiritually dead person you're going to go in the grave and one day
[time=3226] you're going to be resurrected out of the grave and stand before the white throne judgment of God and be consigned to hell forever unless while you're alive you say I will receive Jesus Christ as my
[time=3238] Savior and having received the sun receive life and if you do that then you have a glorious hope of
[time=3244] living forever with God on and on and on into the future never ever to die it's the aid old formula
[time=3252] that says this if you've been born once you've got to die twice if you've only been born physically
[time=3259] and never been born spiritually then you're going to die physically but you're also going to die spiritually which means to be separated from God forever my friends if you get born twice you only
[time=3269] have to die once right if you've been born physically and then you've been born spiritually you don't
[time=3275] ever have to die the second death for you're going to go to live with God forever that's a wonderful prospect something that every Christian looks forward to a missionary that I read about recently
[time=3287] by the name of W.B. Heinsen was speaking from a pulpit a year after he found out about a serious
[time=3294] terminal illness and he wrote and he spoke these words he said I remember a year ago when a man
[time=3300] in this city said you have got to go to your death speaking of the doctor he said I heard what he
[time=3307] said and I walked out to where I lived five miles out in the country and he said I looked across at that mountain that I love and I looked at that river in which I rejoice and I looked at those stately trees which grow up on my plantation that are always God's own poetry to my soul and he said this is what I said I looked up into the great sky where God was lighting his lamps and I said I
[time=3329] may not see you many more times but mountain when you're gone and when you're forever past
[time=3337] I shall be alive river I might not get to see you many more times come down the mountain
[time=3343] trickling down over the rocks as I see you today but when you're all dried up and there's no more
[time=3349] of you I'll still be living on stars I'll be alive when you've fallen out of your sockets
[time=3357] and the world has come to an end if you have the sun you have life and that life never ends it goes
