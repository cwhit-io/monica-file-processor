[time=15] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=25] [MUSIC]
[time=55] >> Thank you for the good singing, you may be seated.
[time=64] We're happy to welcome you to this service.
[time=70] Thank you for sharing it with us.
[time=72] Those of you who are here in the auditorium for the second hour of worship at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and then all of you who have joined us by way of television.
[time=80] We're glad you could share this time with us, and we know it's going to be a blessing to you as we open the Word of God in a few moments to teach the Scriptures, and then as we worship our Lord and Savior by means of music.
[time=92] Our choir is going to sing a song right now that talks about Jesus Christ as the great cornerstone of our faith.
[time=100] Please listen carefully and share in the worship of our Savior as we sing unto Him.
[time=107] [MUSIC]
[time=120] >> Jesus is the cornerstone if our sin is to a turn.
[time=134] For we change it by His own, we became the cornerstone.
[time=147] Jesus is the cornerstone.
[time=154] When I am my sin of grace, from the stone I am at rest,
[time=168] when the sins of truth are so.
[time=175] He remains a cornerstone.
[time=182] Jesus is the cornerstone of our strong.
[time=276] Jesus is the cornerstone.
[time=283] Jesus is the cornerstone of our strong.
[time=358] Thank you, choir.
[time=359] I love the music and also am very excited about the message of Jesus Christ who is the cornerstone
[time=366] to the church and to each of our lives.
[time=369] Take just a moment while our children's choirs are getting in place to remind all of you here that one of our faithful singers and choir members, Mr. Ron Hackett, is in the
[time=379] hospital today.
[time=380] I know that we are praying for him.
[time=382] He has been in some severe pain with his back and I know that all of us will pray and
[time=388] we want to encourage Ron as he is sharing the service by television today.
[time=392] Normally he is on the other side of the camera and we appreciate his ministry so very much.
[time=396] I also want to say a word of encouragement and hopefully a helpful word of comfort to
[time=403] one of our own, Mr. Earl Dixon, who lost his wife this past week, let him know of our love and encouragement during this time of sorrow.
[time=411] Well children's choirs grow up to be adult choirs but not if someone isn't training them and teaching them and encouraging them in their music and we are so grateful for the graded choir program that God has given us in our church and we are thankful that as these children are taught to sing, we give them opportunity to sing in our worship services that they continue to love music and become part of a great church choir of the future.
[time=435] Listen now as the children's choir sings for us.
[time=451] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=558] [APPLAUSE]
[time=567] We're so very thankful for your participation in the ministry of the Bible hour and for our opportunity to come into your home each week with the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=576] One of the reasons that the Bible hour continues on the many stations where it is seen and heard
[time=582] is related to a group of friends who have participated in what we call the sponsor's program.
[time=589] Now the sponsor's program is a very interesting way that people get behind the Bible hour and make it available in their area on a specific Sunday.
[time=598] For instance, in each of the areas where the Bible hour is seen it is possible for us to compute the cost of sending the Bible hour into that area and a full sponsor underwrites the entire program in their area for a special Sunday.
[time=613] Now some folks do it in honor of a loved one, some people do it in their own name and some who can't give all but's needed to fully sponsor a station become associate sponsors and give $100 to help underwrite the cost of the television program
[time=630] the Bible hour on their particular station.
[time=633] We're so very happy today to share with you that we have a full sponsor here in the Fort Wayne area, a dear friend and brother who happens to belong to this local church.
[time=642] His name is Max Portman, he is sponsoring the Bible hour on channel 21 and it is in honor of Grace Portman.
[time=650] We appreciate so much Max, your willingness to help in this way and we thank God for your faithfulness in the support of this ministry and especially today through the sponsoring of the Bible hour here in Fort Wayne.
[time=664] I'd like to encourage you who would like to have a part in the Bible hour to think about the possibility of being a sponsor or an associate sponsor.
[time=672] If you're interested in more information about that you can write to us at our Bible hour office, we'll give you the phone number in just a few moments and the address as well.
[time=681] I want to share with you now that we have made available over the months of the Bible hour ministry a very special Bible study tool called the answer book.
[time=690] It's a very special tool simply because it deals with the scriptures in topical order.
[time=695] Many times when you're talking with friends about the things of God passages of scripture will pop into your mind and you know they're in the Bible somewhere you just wish you could put your finger on them and show them directly what the scripture has to say.
[time=709] So many folks communicated that message to us that several months ago we sat down with the key topics of discussion as it relates to scriptural truth and we organized those topics each of them on a specific page under a heading
[time=724] so that now it's possible for you to go through the scriptures in a very quick fashion and find the passage of scripture that you want dealing with the subject you're looking for.
[time=734] This topical answer book has information in it on the subjects of anger and courage and comfort and discouragement, forgiveness and grief.
[time=742] As you leaf through the book you find just one passage after another related to those specific problems that you face in your own life.
[time=751] We've received word that a number of doctors have placed the answer book on the table in their waiting room
[time=757] so that patients can read through the scriptures as they're waiting to be treated.
[time=761] Others have found creative uses for this little scriptural portion and well we just like to encourage you to either write or call us and receive your free copy of the answer book this week.
[time=773] If you'd like to have your free copy of the answer book all you need to do is go to your phone and call this number 1-800-453-9000.
[time=783] When you call that number ask for the bible hour operator and tell her you'd like to have your free copy of the answer book or if you choose you can write to us here at the bible hour office by simply addressing your letter to pastor David Jeremiah post office box fifteen thousand Fort Wayne, Indiana forty six eight one five when we hear from you this week it'll be our joy and privilege to enclose a copy of the answer book in a return envelope and send it to your address praying that the word of God will be a source of encouragement to your own life.
[time=815] Now in just a few moments we're going to open the word of God to the gospel of John and hold a trial in a sense it's a trial of the deity of Jesus Christ and according to the fifth chapter of John there are four witnesses who are brought before the stand to give testimony I think you'll find it interesting as we examine the scriptures together in just a few moments.

[time=1041] and we're honoring all of our seniors and graduates this morning a little bit later on they will be given a beautiful copy of this New Testament it's a walk through the Bible edition of the New Testament that has a lot of helpful notes in it that they will appreciate and I hope we'll use many times in the future we're grateful to God for steering them through their educational process to this milestone
[time=1065] and we want to take just a moment to lift them up before the Father in Heaven in Thanksgiving and in dedication so let's about together in prayer shall we our God in Heaven we thank you that we live in a land that makes it possible for us to learn

[time=1272] to be consumed as to the soul to be understood to be loved as to love
[time=1292] for it is in giving that we receive
[time=1304] is in bringing that we have made it is in doing that we have learned
[time=1330] to be together
[time=1346] Thank you Lenna
[time=1353] now will you open your Bibles with me to the gospel of John John's gospel and the fifth chapter
[time=1361] the fifth chapter of John's gospel and we're reading today beginning at the 30th verse and reading through unto the end of the chapter
[time=1369] John chapter 5 verses 30 through 47
[time=1376] I hope you brought your Bible so you can follow along as I read if you didn't listen carefully or share a Bible from someone who seated next to you
[time=1386] I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father who hath sent me
[time=1397] if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that bear witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnessed of me is true
[time=1407] you sent unto John and he bore witness unto the truth but I receive not testimony from man but these things I say that you might be saved
[time=1416] he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
[time=1422] but I have greater witness than that of John for the works which the Father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me and the Father himself who hath sent me hath borne witness of me
[time=1437] you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent
[time=1445] him you believe not search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
[time=1453] and you will not come to me that you might have life I receive not honor from men but I know you that you have not the love of God in you
[time=1461] I am coming my Father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive
[time=1467] how can you believe who receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from God only do not think that I will accuse you to the Father
[time=1476] there is one that accuse if you even Moses in whom you trust for had you believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me
[time=1483] but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words let us pray
[time=1491] our Father we come again to the words of our Savior the Lord Jesus recorded for us so faithfully by John the evangelist and secured to our hearts by the Holy Spirit
[time=1504] through the process of inspiration revelation joining together to give us the infallible word of God in our hands
[time=1512] we thank you O God for this gift to us a gift which reveals the character of our Creator in terms that we can understand it
[time=1522] in flesh and blood in the form of Jesus Christ we pray that you will give us understanding as we interpret the word of God today
[time=1530] and open hearts and lives to assimilate its truth that its truth might take hold upon us and make us like unto the Son of God
[time=1539] for we pray in his name and for his sake amen
[time=1545] everywhere I go Jesus Christ is on trial
[time=1551] he is either being hailed or assailed he is either being believed or disbelieved loved or hated accepted or rejected
[time=1566] that is the way it would always be or in his own words he said if you are not for me you are against me
[time=1574] he made it quite impossible for anyone living in his time or in the days of the future to find a neutral ground as it related to his own person
[time=1585] you could not say maybe when someone asked you if you trusted in Christ either you believed in him or you did not
[time=1594] there is no middle ground Jesus of course was on trial just before his death in the past he will continue to be on trial always in the hearts of men until the end of the age
[time=1610] the past and the future are not in our control men and women Jesus is on trial today he is on trial for some of you this morning
[time=1620] for you will be deciding in these next moments what you will do with him and in the words of the hymn writer neutral you cannot be someday your heart will be asking what will he do with me
[time=1634] in the passage that we have read this morning we have the record of our Lord's defense of his deity
[time=1642] Jesus is on trial in the minds of the Jews because he committed the unpardonable sin in their way of thinking he healed a man on the Sabbath day
[time=1654] the Jews looked at the Sabbath day as a cloak of righteousness which they wrapped tightly around themselves
[time=1660] it was their means of keeping an outward facade of holiness while they violated all of the other things that were important as far as the heart was concerned
[time=1671] but they lived in their own sensuality while draping around themselves their observant of the Sabbath and Jesus came and by healing a man on the Sabbath he destroyed their mask
[time=1682] and he stripped them naked so that they had to look at themselves as they really were and they were very angry because of that
[time=1690] we read in this text that when Jesus violated the Sabbath that from that moment on the Jews sought how they might kill him
[time=1698] and they determined to do away with this man who made them look at themselves as they really were
[time=1704] so Jesus in his argument against them and in answering their questions about why he would heal on the Sabbath makes a very perceptive statement
[time=1714] but one that caused them to be even more angry when then they were in the first place he said you accuse me of breaking the law of the Sabbath
[time=1722] well let me tell you something I created the Sabbath because you see he said Jesus I am God
[time=1729] well when he broke the Sabbath that was a human tradition but when he claimed to be equal with God in the minds of the Jews that was blasphemy
[time=1738] and so they were really after him from that moment on and in the text that's before us today Jesus takes the opportunity to demonstrate to these Jews that what he claims about himself is really true
[time=1751] he says I will prove to you that I am God let us set up in our minds a court the judge and the jury are there
[time=1759] the witnesses are all brought before the tribunal one by one Jesus brings the witnesses before these Jewish hostile people
[time=1767] and he says if you will hear the word of testimony you will have to agree that I am the Christ
[time=1773] now Jesus mentions as he begins his courtroom situation that if he bear witness of himself verse 31 his witness would not be true
[time=1784] obviously that doesn't mean that he's going to tell a lie or that you can't believe what he says he is simply accommodating himself to their position and he is saying now if I stand up here and tell you that I am God which I have done
[time=1797] you won't believe me so just discount that for the moment don't take my word for it let me bring some witnesses before you and you hear what they say
[time=1807] Jesus was well acquainted with the Old Testament tradition that in the mouth of two or three witnesses a matter was established
[time=1814] he goes one better he brings four and let's examine them in the text as we understand what Jesus is doing as he claims to be God
[time=1823] now many women before we look at these verses let me say to you that if Jesus is not God Christianity is a farce
[time=1829] if Jesus is not deity the church is a hoax if Jesus Christ is not God there is no salvation there is no resurrection from the dead there is no future hope for those who put their trust in him
[time=1841] his deity is the very core of Christianity and that's why he spends so much time dealing with that issue before those who come to hear him
[time=1850] the first witness that he brings before the hostile Jews is the witness of the forerunner John notice what he says
[time=1859] verse 33 you sent unto John and he bore witness unto the truth now when did the Jews send unto John well if you'll just turn back in your Bibles to chapter 1 and verse 19 you will see that there was a time when the Jews sent unto John to find out who he was
[time=1876] and we read about this in the 19th verse of chapter 1 and this is the witness of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who are you
[time=1889] and he confessed and denied not but confessed I'm not the Christ and they ask him what then are you Elijah and he said I am not
[time=1899] art thou then that prophet he said no then said they unto him well who are you then that we may give an answer to them that sent us what do you say of yourself and he answered and said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness
[time=1915] make way make straight the way of the Lord and later on in the same chapter when Jesus walked across the landscape he pointed to Jesus Christ and he said behold the lamb of God which taken the way this into the world
[time=1929] John always gave testimony to Jesus Christ as God's redeemer as God's son as God's lamb and as God himself so Jesus said you want to have a witness to my deity alright John you take the witness stand what do you say
[time=1944] John says Jesus is the Christ now it's interesting to me to just stop for a moment and to share with you that human testimony is important though it is not the ultimate testimony that we would make
[time=1958] human testimony is important one of the reasons why it isn't the ultimate testimony is because it is always based on experience and sometimes we get the impression that our testimony about our experience creates the reality
[time=1974] let me say to you today that if we don't give credence to the fact that Jesus Christ is God he is still God if we don't experience him he hasn't changed one bit he is not God because we feel him or because we experience him he is God because it is his nature to be God
[time=1991] and we know he is God because of the revelation we have from him in the scriptures but testimony is still important isn't it and it's very important for us to be able to say I know whom I have believed
[time=2003] I know him you know back in the time when the God is dead movement was just beginning and it's sort of you know God is back alive again so I guess we don't have to talk about that too much but there used to be signs on bumpers that said my God is not dead I talked to him this morning
[time=2020] and I used to like to read that and that's a great truth but you know if that's all we had we wouldn't have much would we because I could say that about anything that's just my experience that gives me an intro into the gospel but that's not the bottom line
[time=2032] John's testimony is important but it isn't the ultimate witness and that's coming along in this passage of scripture
[time=2039] I remember preaching one time and here in this auditorium and a lady said to me at the door as she left she said Pastor Jeremiah while you were preaching I saw a cross appear on the velvet curtain behind you
[time=2051] and she said your sermon was such a blessing to me because of that well I want my sermons to be a blessing apart from any appearance of a cross the cross doesn't validate the message and I really don't think there was a cross back there although I don't ever look that way I'm always looking this way
[time=2067] she had an experience and she used that experience to validate what she thought was truth and that's always a dangerous thing if that's all you have
[time=2075] but you see that's not all we have Jesus pays to John the Baptist one of the highest compliments when he says about him in verse 35 one of the three eulogies that he gives of John
[time=2087] he says John was a burning and a shining light what kind of a testimony is this that this man is giving well Jesus said he was a burning and a shining light is a very interesting thing happening in that phrase
[time=2099] the word light is not the word force which is the general word for light in the New Testament it's the word which we would translate he was a wick
[time=2107] he wasn't the light he was just the wick burning the light was from other places beside him he was consumed with the testimony about God and Christ but he wasn't the light and John said that didn't he was not the light he was sent to bear testimony of that light
[time=2123] but Jesus said he was a burning and a shining light now notice how he validates John's right to give testimony because you know if you were a Jew at that trial you might say well
[time=2135] why should I listen to John so what if John says you're Christ Jesus just puts this little barb in there he says you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light
[time=2147] the Jews were crazy about John the Baptist when he first started preaching they went in droves out to hear him and they had huge crowds and it was gone great until John quit preaching and started meddling he started talking about repentance
[time=2160] and sin and righteousness and judgment when he did that their season of rejoicing began to dissipate and they didn't like to hear him anymore there are a lot of preachers today that have everybody rejoicing and the reason is they don't ever give you the bad news
[time=2174] always give me the good news I heard about a messenger boy one time who applied for a job at a telegram office his only stipulation was he absolutely refused to serve any negative messages from the telegram office
[time=2187] a lot of preachers like that don't want to give any negative messages well John let it all hang out he told the whole truth and when he started talking about their sin they're rejoicing passed
[time=2198] but Jesus said there was a time when you thought John was alright so listen to what he says he says I'm the Christ second witness
[time=2205] the first one is the forerunner John the second one is the finished work of Christ notice verse 36 but I have a greater witness than that of John now you see Jesus is a master lawyer
[time=2215] he builds from the ground up he takes the least witness and then the next one and the next one and he brings to a grand conclusion the testimony about his deity the next witness that Jesus brings before this tribunal is his works
[time=2229] he says for the works which the father have given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father have sent me turn back in your Bibles to chapter 2 of John and notice that the works of Jesus were always used to bring about faith in the minds of those who saw what he did in John chapter 2 in verse 23 we read
[time=2254] now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast day many believed in his name why did they believe because they saw the miracles which he did
[time=2266] when Jesus did miracles people saw those miracles and they believed now in this particular instance they didn't really believe they just believed superficially but notice chapter 3 when Nicodemus comes on the scene the testimony that he gives to Jesus Christ
[time=2281] there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews he came to Jesus by night and he sent it to him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God how did he know that notice
[time=2293] for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him Nicodemus got the message that the miracles that Jesus did were miracles that came from heaven and no man could do those without God
[time=2307] turn in your Bibles to chapter 10 of John John chapter 10 verses 37 and 38 Jesus is talking again and he is saying in verse 37 if I do not the works of my father don't believe me isn't that interesting
[time=2325] Jesus said listen if you don't want to believe me you have to climb over what I do and if I don't do the father's works then don't believe me but
[time=2333] if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I and him what does Jesus say he's saying listen you don't have to believe me if you don't want to
[time=2347] but if you see me doing the works that only God can do you've got to deal with that evidence somehow you can't just sweep that under the rug
[time=2355] and you see the whole gospel of John is a summation of the evidence of Jesus works John at the end of the book before he signed his name and closing set
[time=2366] these things are written unto you that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ John 20 30 and 31
[time=2372] and then he builds the whole gospel as we've been studying around the key miracles in the life of Jesus Christ
[time=2379] you say to me how do I know Jesus is God I'll tell you how I know one day he took six water pots filled with water and he performed a miracle and turned it into wine
[time=2390] just like that one day a nobleman came to him and said my son who was 20 miles away is sick and Jesus healed him at 20 miles distance sent him home by the time he got home his son was totally restored
[time=2404] you ask me how I know that Jesus is God one day a blind man came to him and Jesus said putting clay on his eyes and sending him to the pool of Siloam go and wash and when you wash
[time=2415] you will see you know how I know Jesus is God I'll tell you one day stood outside of Lazarus tomb and he shouted Lazarus come forth
[time=2426] and Lazarus walked out of that grave having been dead for three days having already started to decompose and he was alive because Jesus brought him back
[time=2438] wherever he met blind men he healed them where he met lame men he caused them to walk one day when the disciples were in the midst of the sea he walked off of the shore right onto the water never missed a step right out to the middle of the sea got in the boat and immediately the boat was at the other side
[time=2453] friends those are miracles which God alone can do and Jesus said I am God you want to know how you can be sure of that stand on the witness stand my works and testify to what I've done
[time=2469] when I read the pages of the New Testament and see what Jesus did I know he is God the supreme testimony to his deity is not in what he did for others the supreme testimony of his deity in the area of his works was the day that he walked out of the grave himself
[time=2486] when the stone was rolled away and Jesus it says in the scripture was quickened by the spirit of his own volition he got up out of that tomb and he walked out of that tomb and forever he screamed to the world I am God
[time=2503] or you cannot come back from the dead of yourself unless you be God no man has ever done that
[time=2514] well the first witness then is the forerunner John and the second witness are the finished works of Christ let's notice the third one
[time=2522] the third witness is the father's word verses 37 and 38 and the father himself who has sent me have borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
[time=2538] and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him you believe not now what is he saying he's saying that the father's word is the supreme testimony up to this point
[time=2549] John's testimony is good and the works of Christ are good but the father's word is supreme what the father says about Jesus Christ is critical
[time=2563] and notice what Jesus is saying here in these verses he's saying you don't know the scriptures because you don't know me notice you have not heard his voice at any time or seen his shape and you don't have his word in you because the one he sent you don't believe
[time=2582] and now the Jews were very conscious of the scriptures and the word of the father they were very enamored with what the father had to say especially in the Old Testament scriptures they claim to believe it in fact they were almost biblioliters they believe the word of God I wish I could tell you some of the things that happened when the scribes copied the scripture
[time=2601] how very precise they were because this was the holy word of the father and Jesus is looking right into their faces and he is saying you claim to believe what the father says but you don't believe that because I'm the one he sent and you reject me
[time=2622] you have not his word abiding in you for him whom he has sent you believe not turn in your bibles to 1 John chapter 5 verses 9 and 10 here we read in 1 John 5 9 and 10 these words
[time=2642] if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his son he that believeth on the son of God hath the witness in himself
[time=2655] he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son what is John saying he is saying that the way you believe is by having Christ in you it's a circular argument
[time=2670] you can't believe the word of the father if you don't have the son living within you and you can't have the son living within you without the words of the father telling you how he comes to live within you but it comes in the package we call salvation
[time=2683] so that when you have Christ you can receive the word of the father that's what Paul meant when he wrote in Romans chapter 8 and verse 16 that the spirit of God bears witness with my spirit that I am the child of God
[time=2697] do you ever have someone say to you I'm a Christian you say how do you know and they may not be taught yet and they say well I just know well how do you know well I just know in here
[time=2706] well that's kind of nebulous how can you explain that well it's not all the net as nebulous as you think it is because the Bible says that when you come to Christ
[time=2715] that the spirit of God bears witness with the spirit of man that you belong to the father and there is an inward witness that you are a Christian and John is talking about that or Jesus is talking about that here
[time=2726] when he says you can't hear the words of the father because if I could use today's vernacular friend you don't have the equipment you don't have the receiver you don't have the frequency
[time=2736] you can't get the father's word because the father sent the son to live in you so you can hear the father's word and you don't have him
[time=2744] now if you were a Jew and were as enamored with the Old Testament scriptures as they were you can understand why Jesus quickly got in trouble with those Jewish people
[time=2754] notice his fourth argument this is the longest section in this passage it is the faithful writings of the scripture or the scriptures themselves
[time=2764] in verse 39 he seems to make a command I believe he's making a statement you can use it either way but I believe he is saying you search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
[time=2779] now I want you to notice several things in these verses that will help you to understand what our Lord is doing he is talking now about the scriptures as a means of knowing about Jesus Christ I want you to notice first of all that when the Jews dealt with the scriptures they relied on them for salvation that was their whole hope
[time=2797] verse 39 you search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life now what is Jesus saying he is saying first of all you study the scriptures the word search is a word which is translated sometimes in the scriptures
[time=2811] in a way to give this picture of a dog actually trailing down his prey Jesus says to these Jewish people you're just like a you're just like a hound dog when it comes to the scripture
[time=2823] you get your nose in the scripture and you search out every little avenue trying to understand what it says that's true the Jews were like that
[time=2830] you know if we could get something of their educational process and communicating the word of God to our children we'd have a whole generation of men and women who are knowledgeable of the scripture
[time=2838] their catechisms to teach the Old Testament scriptures were phenomenal the Jewish children as they grew up in a Jewish home would know great whole portions of the Old Testament scripture could stand on their feet
[time=2849] when they were 12 years old and recite major portions of the Old Testament they knew the scriptures because they studied them diligently now notice secondly
[time=2858] Jesus says you study them because in them you think you have eternal life now the word think there is a word which means to trust completely but mistakenly
[time=2870] they thought they had eternal life but they really didn't they had put all of their hope and their trust in the scriptures but you see the scriptures do not bring salvation it is the one about whom the scriptures speak that bring salvation
[time=2883] and the Jews studied and they searched and they thought that by going through the process of the scriptures they were Christians they were alright before God
[time=2894] but they relied on the scriptures for salvation but now notice what happened there's a very subtle little process that takes place while studying the scriptures and relying on the scriptures number two they reject the Savior of the scriptures notice verse 40
[time=2908] and you will not come to me that you might have life verse 43 I am coming my father's name and you receive me not Jesus says you're going through all of the mechanical process to study these Old Testament scriptures you know them inside and out you know what's on every page but having gone through all of that you missed the whole purpose of the scriptures you don't know me
[time=2931] you say does that go on today friends there are folks in seminaries all over the country who mechanically are taking the scriptures apart and putting them back together they don't know anything at all about the message of the scriptures who is a person Jesus Christ
[time=2943] you can become enamored with an outward mechanical approach to the word of God and become steeped in scriptural information you may be able to recite large portions of it but if you haven't come to put your faith in the person of the scriptures who is Jesus Christ you're lost in in your sins
[time=2960] that's what Jesus is saying to these they're very religious people they know the Bible but they're not Christians they don't know Christ
[time=2967] all over our country today people pile into their cars and rush off to church and sit and listen to a sermon and they hold their Bible sometimes or they read some portion of the scripture in the bulletin they walk out and they feel like it's okay I've searched the scriptures I've been to church I've done a religious thing but the Bible says you can be an expert in the word of God and be lost and on your way to hell without God
[time=2989] now they search the scriptures to find salvation but they rejected the person of the scriptures notice thirdly that the reason they rejected was built upon three or four basic assumptions that were wrong
[time=3007] number one they were unwilling to accept the Christ of the scriptures which we've already talked about and number two they really weren't interested in God
[time=3015] you say a religious Jew not interested in God well notice what the Lord said to him in verse 42 but I know you you don't have the love of God in you
[time=3025] well that's really strong isn't it I mean that's powerful the Lord's speaking to the religious aristocracy of his day and he's looking him right now and he says you don't even love God
[time=3035] you carry your big scrolls around and study them hour on hour but you don't love God
[time=3041] Paul wrote about them over in the book of Romans he said they have a zeal without knowledge they have an outward profession without any reality in their heart just like so many people today walking around in religious circles
[time=3054] they're doing their thing but they don't know God they don't have the love of God in them notice the third thing that was wrong with them
[time=3063] they were unwilling to accept Christ they really didn't know and love God the third thing is they really would have preferred an unaccredited savior over Jesus Christ
[time=3073] notice what he says he says I come in my father's name verse for 43 and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you receive
[time=3085] now that just blows my mind Jesus has prayed at all of these witnesses before them and he's saying here I am I am the accredited Messiah
[time=3093] the stamp of approval from the Father from John the Baptist from the Scriptures I am the Messiah you won't receive me but if another comes without any accreditation at all him you'll receive
[time=3105] and you know what folks from the day that Jesus spoke that until the day there have been over 60 who have claimed to be the Messiah
[time=3112] and they have run after them like we run after all of our great sensational preachers and teachers today
[time=3119] one by the name of Simon Barcoba was so realistic about his Messiah's ship that people actually died for him
[time=3126] and then you ask me how can you tell me pastor that in the day in the future men will flock after the anti Christ and believe in him while they're doing it now
[time=3136] just as John said there are many anti-Christ who have already come out among you people are enamored with great spiritual teachers and Jesus who is the accredited Messiah has come to present himself with all of his accreditation
[time=3149] they reject him and they run after a cheap substitute and men and women are doing that in our culture today
[time=3157] you know I was talking at the Moody pastors conference with a pastor from California he said all you got to do to start a new religion is dress up funny put on a stupid hat and stand out in the middle of 77
[time=3170] on the middle of sunset strip and he said you can have 50 followers in a half hour just look weird all you have to do is just look weird
[time=3178] why are we like that here is the Savior given to us in the scripture we reject him and we run off after somebody else who doesn't even come up to the standard of the accreditation of our Savior
[time=3193] well notice what the Lord did in closing in his argument boy he's a master trial lawyer in closing in verses 45 to 47 he says now I've accused you I've given you all this evidence
[time=3207] I've told you why you don't receive me but I want to tell you something I'm not going to accuse you to the Father
[time=3213] wait a minute what are you talking about Lord isn't it true that when we stand before the Father we are judged no wait a minute notice what he's saying
[time=3219] do not think verse 45 that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuse if you even Moses in whom you trust boy that was the death blow that was the mighty blow that Jesus gave against the opposition
[time=3235] he says all right if you don't want to be judged by me fine let Moses do it you see the Jews thought Moses was he was the patron saint of the Old Testament if I could put it that way he was the giver of the law
[time=3248] the one that they had venerated at the top level and so Jesus said all right you don't believe me you don't have to be judged by me just be judged by Moses now notice what he says
[time=3259] for if you had believed Moses if you really had believed Moses you would have believed me why because Moses spoke he wrote about me
[time=3268] you studied the Old Testament scriptures the writings of Moses he looked forward to the Messiah and Jesus was standing right there in front of now notice the Jews were saying we don't believe you we believe Moses
[time=3277] Jesus says no you don't you don't believe Moses because he wrote of me and if you really believe Moses you believe me why he has leveled them there is nothing left they don't have a prayer there's not another argument they can say because he is right
[time=3293] if you believe not his writings how are you going to believe my words now you know a lot of folks that say to me pastor Jeremiah when I get to heaven
[time=3304] I'm not going to be judged by Jesus Christ or what about those folks who've never heard about him do you know what you'll be judged by any standard you choose and you will fail
[time=3313] you say I'm going to heaven because I'm a good person fine you can have that judgment if you will when you stand before God according the book of Revelation he'll take out the book of your works
[time=3322] and he will say so you want to be judged by your works do you all right let's read them and you're dead you're a you're a goner you don't have a shot
[time=3333] you say well I'm going to be judged by my benevolence and the Lord will say all right we'll judge you by your benevolence and the standard is the benevolence of God in heaven who gave his only begotten son and you fail
[time=3347] you see if we're to be judged before the Father in any other way except through the person of the Lord Jesus Christ there is absolutely no hope and that's what Jesus was trying to help these Jewish people see
[time=3360] you cannot come to the Father except through Jesus Christ he is the way the truth and the life and you can't get to God except through him
[time=3373] Jesus is on trial he has always been on trial he will always be on trial and he's on trial for you right now you've got to decide what to do with him you either accept him as Christ or in the process of not accepting him you have rejected him
[time=3389] and you've jumped over into some other standard which will be your judge someday you're the only one who can make the decision I commend him to you as the accredited Messiah the Son of God the Savior of the world and the one who wants to save you from your sin shall we pray
[time=3412] our Father in heaven we are so grateful for your word and we are so thankful that this one Jesus of whom we have spoken is the Savior of the world but more specifically he is my Savior and he longs to be the Savior of all who will put their trust in him
