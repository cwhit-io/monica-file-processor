[time=0] (buzzer beeping) - From the Convocation Center
[time=27] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerramon.
[time=35] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=75] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=88] We're so happy to welcome you here today.
[time=89] This is a beautiful Lord's Day, and we're grateful to have you here for this service.
[time=94] We have some visitors that we've met already, and we welcome you in a special way to the service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=101] And then in this particular hour, we open the door of the Black Hawk Baptist Church widely to include all of our friends who watch us by television here in this area and throughout the Midwestern part of our country.
[time=113] And so we welcome you and thank you for being with us today.
[time=116] I know this will be a time of blessing and encouragement as we sing together and open God's word, and we invite you to join us now as we begin our worship with the ministry of our choir.
[time=126] (gentle piano music)
[time=133] [MUSIC - 158 seconds]
[time=300] - Thank you, choir.
[time=313] This is a time of the year when we begin to think about our country in a special way.
[time=318] And I'm glad to be an American and to say that I still believe that our trust is in God.
[time=324] And as long as we can fan that flame, America has a chance.
[time=329] I'm glad that we believe it's all right to be patriotic and to believe in our great land.
[time=335] Well, Stephen Maria Gardner are here today to share with us in music.
[time=339] And they have a beautiful anthem of the church, which they do in their own special way.
[time=343] I know you'll enjoy it.
[time=344] - Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=346] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 78 seconds]
[time=433] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=492] - We're so happy that you've joined us today
[time=506] on the Bible Hour, and Donna, it's good to have this opportunity to share with our friends at home what God is doing through this ministry and what He would like to do through this ministry for each of them.
[time=516] I know you have some special people, you won't introduce, but let me take a moment first and share with the folks at home that we have recently written to all of our Bible Hour friends, sharing with them a very special opportunity for them to be involved financially with this ministry.
[time=531] As most of you know, we're entering into the summer months and those months provide some interesting opportunities for this ministry to really trust God.
[time=539] And as you get the letter from my desk in the next few days, perhaps some of you've already received it, I hope you'll take time to sit down and read it carefully and prayerfully.
[time=549] And then before God send the largest gift you can send to support this ministry, though we don't spend a lot of time on the air talking about money.
[time=559] We give our time to the teaching of the Word of God and the ministry of music.
[time=564] Nonetheless, the cost of television time is just the same for us as it is for all of the other programs that are on the air.
[time=570] So periodically, we have to take the opportunity of sharing with you our financial needs and encouraging you to get behind this program and support it with your love, gifts, and offerings.
[time=581] So before you do anything else, just make a mental note right now.
[time=585] This is the week I'm going to send my gift to the Bible hour and do it today before you forget it.
[time=591] Donna, there are some folks who have done some very substantial things for the Bible hour ministry.
[time=595] We call them our sponsors, and I know you have a couple of them to share with us today.
[time=600] - Yes, we do, we have two associate sponsors today, both of whom are from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=606] Kent Prophet, who views the Bible hour on channel 21, and also Mr. and Mrs. Paul Haberle, who also view on channel 21 here in Fort Wayne.
[time=616] And we thank you folks so much for your part in the ministry of the Bible hour, for without the support of many of you at home, the Bible hour would not be a possibility.
[time=626] - Donna, that gives me the opportunity to say to all of our friends at home that the sponsors program is a very exciting way for you to get involved on Christian television.
[time=634] If you would like to be a full sponsor, we will give you the costs of the station that you watch the Bible hour on, and you can have the opportunity of underwriting the airtime on that station for one full week for the broadcast that comes your way on Sunday, and you can have the satisfaction in your own heart of knowing that you've sponsored the program, that particular Sunday.
[time=654] We'd be happy to dedicate it to someone that you love, perhaps in memory of someone who has passed on to the other side who's gone to be with the Lord.
[time=662] And if you'll just let us know, your desire will be happy to do our very best to help you use the Bible hour as a means of glorifying God in your own life.
[time=671] And then, of course, the associate sponsors are those that Donna was just sharing with us and they're folks who have given $100 to the support of this ministry and are helping us as an associate sponsor in the thing that God is doing through the Bible hour ministry.
[time=685] Before we go back to the service, I wanna take just a moment to share with you a very special booklet that has been prepared.
[time=691] Many of you already know a lot about this.
[time=693] Some of you have your own copy at home, but it's called the answer book, and it's simply a very, very handy pocket size edition of a scriptural concordance.
[time=704] We have taken the key verses relative to all of the major subjects that will be of interest to you.
[time=709] We have not just printed the reference.
[time=711] We have printed the entire verse on a page under the topics, under the subject, so that as you leaf through the book, you can find the subject and then find all of the verses that relate to it.
[time=723] I'd like to ask you today if you haven't already received your free copy of the answer book to sit down and write us and let us know that you'd like to receive this handy sized pocket book of scripture.
[time=734] It will help you in your own personal life and encourage you as you walk with the Lord.
[time=739] Now there are two ways you can get this, and Donna's gonna tell you both of them.
[time=743] - We have a toll-free number which you may call at any time during the week.
[time=747] That number is 1-800-4539,000.
[time=751] Just ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like to receive your free copy of the answer book.
[time=758] Or if you prefer, you may write to us that our mailing address is pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and your letters are always especially meaningful
[time=773] to us and we appreciate hearing from you when you do take the time to write.
[time=777] - Thank you, Donna, and we're going to be going back to our service now, we have some more good music, and then in just a few moments I'm going to begin a new series of messages on the subject, the priorities of the church.
[time=787] Today, the priority of preaching.
[time=790] And I'm especially excited about this one.
[time=792] I hope you'll stay tuned with your Bibles open, a piece of paper and a pencil to take a few notes, and we'll share together our study of the Word of God today.
[time=805] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=1014] - Thank you, ladies.
[time=1022] That's a group called Strictly Feminine.
[time=1024] We're thankful for their ministry and music.
[time=1026] And we're going to hear now from one of the young men who has blessed us with his voice so many times, his name is Keith Brodigum.
[time=1036] And for a while, we had a duo.
[time=1039] And then part of the duo left, and Keith stayed.
[time=1043] And we're so grateful we didn't have to lose them all in one time.
[time=1045] But Keith is a student now at Indiana University in Bloomington, home for the summer days.
[time=1050] And we're grateful we can borrow him for this time and have him share with us in music.
[time=1055] Keith, we're glad to have you.
[time=1056] Share with us with you.
[time=1057] (upbeat music)
[time=1066] [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=1210] - Thank you, Keith, I appreciate that.
[time=1214] Now, if you brought your Bibles, and I hope you did,
[time=1223] I want to ask you to turn with me to the book of Acts.
[time=1225] And most of you who go to Sunday school won't have any trouble finding that book because we've been studying that for the last two quarters, and I don't plan to tramp all over the ground you've been walking on for the last six months, but I have a very, very important series of messages that I want to begin today.
[time=1244] And from the 20th chapter of Acts, as our platform in beginning place on the subject, the priorities of the church, the priorities of the church.
[time=1257] And today, our scripture text is the 20th chapter of the book of Acts, beginning at the 17th verse, Acts chapter 20, verse 17.
[time=1269] A very interesting portion of God's word, which records for us the words that Paul gave to the Ephesian elders and the Ephesian believers before he left them and was not coming back their way again.
[time=1286] So he summarized in his writing all of the things that he felt they needed to know, and he gave it to them in this address and it's recorded for us, and it's a beautiful thing for us to study.
[time=1298] Ephesians are Acts chapter 20, verse 17.
[time=1302] And from my leaders, he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.
[time=1309] And when they were come to him, he said unto them, "You know from the first day that I came into Asia, "after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, "serving the Lord with all humility of mind, "and with many tears and trials, "which be fell me by the lying in weight of the Jews.
[time=1326] "And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, "but have shown you and have taught you publicly "and from house to house.
[time=1333] "Testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, "repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1340] "And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, "not knowing the things that shall be for me there, "except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, "saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
[time=1353] "But none of these things move me, "neither count I my life, dear unto myself, "so that I might finish my course with joy, "and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus "to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[time=1367] "And now, behold, I know that you all, "among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, "shall see my face no more, "wherefore I testify unto you this day, "that I am pure from the blood of all men, "for I have not shunned to declare unto you "all the counsel of God.
[time=1384] "Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves, "and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit "have made you overseers, "to feed the church of God which he hath purchased "with his own blood.
[time=1394] "For I know this, that after my departing, "shall grievous wolves enter in among you, "not sparing the flock.
[time=1401] "Also of your own selves shall men arise, "speaking perverse things, "to draw away disciples after them.
[time=1407] "Therefore, watch and remember, "that for the space of three years, "I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears.
[time=1417] "And now, brethren, I commend you to God "and to the word of his grace, "which is able to build you up "and to give you an inheritance among all them "who are sanctified.
[time=1428] "Shall we pray?
[time=1429] "Our God in heaven, "thank you for this portion of thy word, "for drawing aside the curtain of Paul's heart "and mind and letting us share with him "the deep, dark emotions of his life.
[time=1445] "And to see as he shares these truths with the Ephesians "the priorities that come to the top "as he concludes his ministry with them.
[time=1455] "Lord, I just pray that as we study in this series "the priorities of the church, "you will allow your word and the teaching of it "to penetrate our hearts.
[time=1465] "And Lord, give us a renewed commitment "to the priorities of the gospel of Jesus Christ "and his church, which is the body of Christ.
[time=1475] "Help us in this time as we study "to have open hearts and attentive minds "in Jesus' name I pray.
[time=1481] "Amen." The priorities of the church.
[time=1486] And of the priorities, the priority.
[time=1493] What is it?
[time=1496] With all of my understanding and all of my heart I really believe that the priority, the number one priority of the church around which all of the priorities revolve is the priority of the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=1512] If we have fellowship without the preaching of the Word of God, we have nothing more than worldly socialization.
[time=1523] They're getting together for times of communication and for Christian teas without any foundation for our being, one with another.
[time=1536] If we have evangelism without the preaching of the Word of God, we may have briefly a little bit of a flare or fire of zeal, but without the foundation of the Word of God which feeds our hearts and lives and keeps us zealous for the work of God, soon the flame will begin to die and ultimately the fire will go out.
[time=1557] If we have the ministry of music without the preaching of the Word of God, it will not be long until our music will degenerate to the level of our own spiritual anemia.
[time=1572] We will be singing songs that sound so much like the world we cannot tell them apart from the songs of the church and the words will become experience-centered instead of God-centered.
[time=1584] The music will be a deification of man instead of a glorification of God.
[time=1589] Certainly as we speak these words of the church without the priority of preaching, we cannot help but look around at us in the church and say it sounds rather familiar.
[time=1601] For many of these characteristics are the characteristics which we observe in the church at large.
[time=1608] And if I know anything at all about the primacy of preaching in the church, I believe that the cause of our weakness may very well be the fact that we have ignored in so many respects and in so many areas of the church at large, the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=1624] Now as Paul addresses the Ephesian elders and as he communicates to them the important things for them to remember as he is soon to depart from them, he reminds them over and over again in this 20th chapter of the importance of the preaching of God's Word.
[time=1642] It is so interesting to me as I study this passage of Scripture to discover that not only does he hold aloft for all to see the importance of preaching, but he gives to us the various characteristics of that preaching which will serve as a model for us in any church situation no matter what we may do.
[time=1661] And there are five that I notice and I'd like to share with you.
[time=1665] First of all, Paul is deeply committed to the fact that the Word of God should be preached expositionally.
[time=1674] There should be a teaching and preaching and exposition of the Word of God.
[time=1679] Notice chapter 20 verse 28.
[time=1681] Here in the 28th verse, Paul says to the elders, take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers to feed the church of God, to feed the church of God.
[time=1698] Notice chapter 20 verse 32.
[time=1702] And now brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified.
[time=1713] And the word build up there is the word from which we get the word edified to be edified.
[time=1719] Paul says feed the church of God and edify the brethren.
[time=1724] And the whole concept behind that is the concept of the consistent teaching and preaching of the word of God in that method of preaching which we have come to understand as biblical exposition.
[time=1735] Back in 1742, John Albert Bengal wrote these words.
[time=1741] Listen carefully.
[time=1744] He said, scripture is the foundation of the church.
[time=1748] The church is the guardian of scripture.
[time=1750] When the church is strong in health, the light of scripture shines bright.
[time=1756] When the church is sick, then scripture is corroded by neglect.
[time=1763] And thus it happens that the outward form of scripture and the outward form of the church usually seem to exhibit simultaneously either health or sickness.
[time=1776] And as a rule, the way in which scripture is being treated is an exact correspondence with the condition of the church.
[time=1783] Now Bengal, though he wrote many years ago, put his finger on the source of much of the problem in today's church, we have ceased doing what God has called us to do.
[time=1797] We have ceased to function after the priority of the body of Christ.
[time=1801] We have replaced the preaching of the word of God with dialogue and discussion and films and bazaars and all other kinds of activities, but the purpose of the church, which is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the truth of God.
[time=1818] As the church is the pillar of God's truth, that has passed off the scene.
[time=1824] And we have replaced it if I could use the vernacular of today with spiritual junk food.
[time=1830] We have thrown into the diet of God's people everything other than the teaching and preaching of the word of God.
[time=1837] As a result, we are suffering today in our churches from theological and biblical malnutrition.
[time=1844] And our generation of Christians has grown up not knowing the truth of God, and so they are susceptible to every spiritual disease that the wind of time can blow their way.
[time=1857] We wonder today why it is in so many of our churches.
[time=1860] We have people going down the tubes morally, going down the tubes biblically in terms of cults and isms, and there is one foundational reason for all of that.
[time=1870] They have not been taught and matured in the things of God, so as to withstand the winds of false doctrine that blow their way.
[time=1879] Paul, I believe, as he spoke to these Ephesians, wanted them to understand the importance of their responsibility to the church, to feed them and build them up and edify them through the scriptures that they might be strong and mature and that they might grow under Christ's likeness.
[time=1896] What you say, Pastor Jeremiah, what is expositional preaching?
[time=1901] I think there's a tremendous example of that in the Old Testament book of Nehemiah, and I want you to turn with me, if you will, to the eighth chapter of that book.
[time=1911] You know the story of the book of Nehemiah.
[time=1915] It is the record of Nehemiah's leadership in the reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem.
[time=1923] The walls had been torn down during the destruction of Jerusalem, and Nehemiah now has led a remnant of people in the rebuilding of those walls.
[time=1933] As the walls are rebuilt, and as the city begins to take on its form again, Nehemiah recognizes that one of the attendant problems to the dissipation of the Jews has been the fact that they had forsaken their spiritual moorings.
[time=1947] And so when we come to the eighth chapter, we see Nehemiah involved not, I've never heard so much rustling in all my life.
[time=1955] Nehemiah's in the Old Testament, I'm embarrassed.
[time=1959] And you need a, if you have a good Bible, it's page 553.
[time=1965] Anyway, Nehemiah gets involved now,
[time=1971] not only in a project of outward building, but now that the outward project is built, it's time for him to do the spiritual building.
[time=1980] He realizes that the people have fallen into spiritual decay.
[time=1985] And so a very interesting revival is recorded in Nehemiah's book.
[time=1989] And we find the beginning of it in the eighth chapter.
[time=1991] And I want you to follow along because this chapter tells us how the congregation should receive expositional preaching and how the preacher should go about doing it.
[time=2001] So there's a lesson for you and there's a lesson for me.
[time=2004] And let's follow along.
[time=2005] In verse one of chapter eight.
[time=2007] And all the people gathered themselves together as one man onto the street that was before the Watergate.
[time=2014] And they spoke unto Ezra, the scribe, and said, bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.
[time=2022] Now notice there immediately you see that the people were hungry for the word.
[time=2026] They were asking for the word.
[time=2028] You can just mark it down in your notes that here was an attitude of desire to hear from God.
[time=2034] What a tremendous thing that is for every congregation to develop an attitude of hunger and desire for the word of God.
[time=2040] Now you have to understand these people had been starved for many years.
[time=2044] There had been no teaching, no reading of the law.
[time=2046] So they came hungry to hear from God and they had an attitude of attentiveness and receptivity.
[time=2052] And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women.
[time=2058] And here's how you decide who belongs in children's church.
[time=2062] And all who could hear with understanding.
[time=2064] Who should be in the service?
[time=2065] If you can understand it.
[time=2066] Now I'm not gonna destroy all of the programs we have for children, but that's a very good principle, isn't it?
[time=2071] If you can hear with understanding, if it makes sense to you, you should be exposed to the teaching of the word of God.
[time=2077] So in this congregation, we're all the men and all the women and all of the children who are old enough to understand.
[time=2083] And all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month.
[time=2087] And Ezra read from the law facing the street that was before the Watergate.
[time=2092] Now get this, from the morning until midday, before the men and the women and those who could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive under the book of the law.
[time=2102] They were excited to hear what God had to say.
[time=2105] He started at nine o'clock in the morning and he read until noon, a three hour service.
[time=2111] Now notice, he opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above the people.
[time=2118] And when he opened it, all the people stood up.
[time=2121] What does that say?
[time=2121] They had a reverent attitude toward God's book and toward the teaching of the word.
[time=2126] And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, amen, amen.
[time=2132] And some of you now can feel scriptural when you do that, even though it may be timid.
[time=2137] And you may even get in trouble here.
[time=2138] It says they lifted up their hands.
[time=2141] Said they lifted up their hands and they bowed down their heads and they worship the Lord with their faces to the ground.
[time=2148] Now here was a congregation.
[time=2149] I want you to go back to the first verse and notice that they came together.
[time=2153] What does it say as one man?
[time=2156] They came into the congregation totally unified with their attitude toward the word of God, excited, expectant, with a reverence toward what God was going to say to them.
[time=2166] And as a congregation, that was their whole spirit.
[time=2168] Oh God, when I come to church today, I want to hear what you have to say and I want you to speak to my own heart.
[time=2173] Now, what did Ezra do when he preached expositionally?
[time=2177] Well, let's notice.
[time=2179] Verse eight.
[time=2179] So they read in the book of the law distinctly and they gave the sense and they caused them to understand the reading.
[time=2192] Now men and women, that's the finest definition I know of expositional preaching, any place in the Bible.
[time=2198] It says that Ezra read from the book.
[time=2201] He read clearly so everyone could understand.
[time=2205] And then he said, this is what it means.
[time=2208] He explained what the text meant and then he helped them to understand.
[time=2213] It says he caused them to understand what the word of God meant and here we're dealing with application.
[time=2221] He was not just explaining the Old Testament nuances of the law but he was saying, here's the book, here's what it means and now here's how it can mean something in your own life.
[time=2231] Now, it's clearly and as simply as it can be done when a man picks up this book to preach exposition, what he should do is to read it clearly, explain it thoroughly and apply it directly.
[time=2243] That's exactly what Ezra was doing.
[time=2246] And so a revival broke out and all kinds of evil practices were put away and they came back to God and their faith in the Lord.
[time=2254] Now folks, I want to tell you that the thing that causes churches to be strong is the teaching and preaching of the word of God in such a way so that the people understand what the book says and they understand what it means to them.
[time=2268] It is of no value to anyone to go away from church, understanding all about the Jebusites and the Hittites and the Canaanites that really doesn't have much to do with where we are today.
[time=2279] Now you may have to explore that to get at the real truth of the word of God.
[time=2284] But when you get the truth, then you have to take that truth and say here's how that applies to you and you and you when you go out into the streets tomorrow to live your life before a watching world, here's God's truth and this can apply to your life.
[time=2300] That is expositional preaching.
[time=2301] And that's why Paul reminded the Ephesian elders just as he was about to depart from them.
[time=2307] He said, folks, feed the church of God and I commend you, he said, to the word of grace which is able to build you up and make you strong.
[time=2319] Preaching of the word of God should be expositional preaching.
[time=2322] Now I want you to notice, secondly, that the preaching of the word of God should be evangelistic preaching.
[time=2331] And I may get off the track here because this is a pet peeve of mine.
[time=2334] And sometimes when we have pet peeves, we give it more time than it really deserves.
[time=2340] But I wanna say to you that there is no dichotomy in the preaching of the word of God and evangelism.
[time=2350] In verse 21 of the 20th chapter of the book of Acts, Paul says something that we need to look at carefully.
[time=2357] He says, I kept back nothing, verse 20, that was profitable unto you.
[time=2363] I have shown you and have taught you publicly and from house to house.
[time=2367] Now listen, testifying both to the Jews and to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2376] What was Paul preaching and testifying?
[time=2379] That is the pure and simple gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2383] Repentance toward God, God, I'm sorry for my sin.
[time=2386] Faith toward Jesus Christ.
[time=2388] I believe that Christ died for my sin.
[time=2390] And Paul was teaching and preaching.
[time=2393] And throughout all of that area, he was communicating in his preaching ministry, the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the salvation message.
[time=2402] Well you say, pastor, why is that a pet peeve of yours?
[time=2406] Well, it's simply this.
[time=2408] Throughout our land today, there has grown up a whole host of Bible teaching, Bible teachers, who tell us that the church never should be used for evangelization.
[time=2420] In California, in a church that I know about, there is a constitution and in that constitution, of that church, it says, we endeavor to the best of our ability never to do any evangelization on the church property.
[time=2433] And the thought behind that is this.
[time=2437] It is the philosophy that the church gathers to be taught and it scatters to evangelize.
[time=2442] And there's not a one of us who are biblicists who would say that that is not the primary focus of the church.
[time=2447] We gather to be taught, we scatter out into the world to evangelize.
[time=2451] But men and women, the Bible teaches clearly that when we gather, it is also for the purpose of sharing the truth of God's saving grace.
[time=2461] If we took a toll in our church today of how many people heard the gospel in a church and responded to the doctrine of salvation and were saved, we would find that many, even in this congregation, would say, I came to know Christ in a church building.
[time=2475] We have suffered in our generation from the peril of the pendulum.
[time=2481] We have come to the place where we have reacted against the pure milk of the word of God and the ABCs of salvation being shared Sunday after Sunday after Sunday with no food for believers to the point now where in many churches, all that you get is the teaching and exegesis of the word of God and there is no evangelistic warmth in the message.
[time=2503] There is no appeal for souls.
[time=2505] There is no invitation given.
[time=2506] And men and women march in and out of the church and they get saturated and filled with God's truth and they go out to do nothing about it.
[time=2515] I have been in churches all over this land and I know some of the great Bible teachers of our country.
[time=2521] And I'll tell you that churches where evangelism is not happening as a part of the corporate testimony of the body, evangelism is not happening.
[time=2531] They can stand up and philosophize all they want to about the fact that we come to be taught and we scatter to evangelize.
[time=2538] But if evangelism is not happening in the church, men and women, it's not happening out there.
[time=2543] Because it's the example of what happens in the church when men and women gather when they see people coming to know Christ and responding to the gospel invitation that causes them to be excited to go out and tell others about Jesus Christ.
[time=2556] I was teaching evangelism in a seminary not too many months ago, talking about the importance of evangelism, teaching the truth of the importance of sharing the gospel in our preaching, giving an invitation.
[time=2570] Toward the end of the week, young man raised his hand, a senior about to go into the ministry.
[time=2577] And he said to me, "Pastor, you've been using a term all week and I need to ask you about it." He said, "What is an invitation?" I said, "Would you run that by me again?" No, he said, "I really don't understand the term, what is an invitation?" I said, "Well, if you'll see me after class, I'd be glad to sit down and talk to you about it." And then he told me that he had grown up in a culture where he went to church and they never gave anybody the opportunity to come to know Christ.
[time=2607] They just came in with their pens and their pencils and the word of God, they taught the book, they didn't give an invitation, they never really preached the gospel.
[time=2615] And I said to him, "Young man, how many people do you know who came to know Christ as the direct or the indirect result of your church?" He said, "I can't think of one." You see, there's no place in the Bible where it says
[time=2634] we are to avoid preaching salvation in the church.
[time=2638] I want you to turn with me to a passage of scripture.
[time=2641] Just in case anybody drops this on you, just in case somebody says the church is never to be used for evangelism, I want you to see something in 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=2650] Turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 14 and let me share with you a very interesting example.
[time=2655] 1 Corinthians 14.
[time=2658] And in verses 23 and 24, we read these words,
[time=2667] let me share the context with you.
[time=2669] Paul is teaching the Corinthians about the abuses of the gift of tongues.
[time=2674] And he is telling them that it's gotten out of hand.
[time=2676] It was during the early church movement when the gift was in vogue and it was being used by God to validate the truth.
[time=2683] And he was talking to the Corinthian church about how they had taken this gift and totally abused it.
[time=2688] And now he's making this point in verse 23.
[time=2691] He said, "If therefore, the whole church is come together in one place and they speak with tongues and those come in who are unlearned." Now notice or what?
[time=2703] What does it say class?
[time=2704] They're unbelievers.
[time=2706] Will they not say that you are mad?
[time=2710] What is Paul saying?
[time=2711] He's saying if you come to church and you all speak in a language, nobody understands and someone believer comes in, he's gonna think you're all crazy.
[time=2719] Now notice the next verse.
[time=2720] But if all prophesy, which is the gift of preaching, as we know it today or teaching, if all prophesy and there come in one that believe with not, again an unsaved person or one who is unlearned, what happens to him?
[time=2734] He is convicted of all and he is judged of all.
[time=2737] What is Paul saying?
[time=2739] He is saying that in the church gathering, when God's people come together, there will be unbelievers in the midst and we need to do something that will minister to them.
[time=2749] We need to share with them how they can know Christ.
[time=2752] If we're speaking the unknown language of Christianity, Christianese, if you will, which is an unknown tongue to the unbeliever and they come into our church, they're gonna think we're all crazy.
[time=2765] If I can use that modern application, but if we preach the word of God, the Bible says they are convicted of all, they are judged of all.
[time=2772] There is no dichotomy between exposition and evangelism.
[time=2780] I remember as I struggled with this as I began to preach that I went back into history and began to read the biographies of some of the great preachers who have grown up in past days, men like Charles hadn't Spurgeon, men like Finney, men like Moody, men like Harry Ironside who have given us the legacy of Bible teaching.
[time=2799] And I found that it was consistent in all of these men that they were great teachers of the word of God, but they had a heart for lost people.
[time=2808] And as someone said, wherever they opened the word of God, it bled.
[time=2812] Wherever they opened the scriptures, there was the blood of Jesus Christ being taught and preached and extolled in front of the congregation so that the Old Testament looked forward to the cross.
[time=2822] The New Testament pictured the cross or looked backward to it, but wherever they opened the book, as G. Campbell Morgan once wrote, "I cut across country to Christ." I believe there's a need in our day and age for us to bring together a wedding of exposition and evangelism because they belong together.
[time=2841] A divorce has happened between the two of them so that in some situations we have all evangelism and no teaching and we have a bunch of babies running around starving to death.
[time=2850] And in other situations we have all teaching and no evangelism and we've got a bunch of overstuffed Christians who are sitting there fat and sassy doing nothing for God.
[time=2859] And it is only the balance between those two being brought together that will provide health and growth and outreach and new blood for the Church of Jesus Christ in our day and age.
[time=2873] Preaching should be expositional.
[time=2876] It should be evangelistic.
[time=2877] But let me share with you thirdly that it should be exhaustive.
[time=2883] There are two verses here that I wish sometimes weren't in the Bible.
[time=2886] Any preacher would identify with what I'm saying.
[time=2890] Notice verse 20.
[time=2892] Paul said, "I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, "but I've shown you and taught you publicly "and from house to house." Now notice verse 27.
[time=2902] "For I have not shunned to declare unto you all "the counsel of God." Now the Bible says that all scripture is profitable and all scripture is inspired of God and all scripture brings correction and instruction in righteousness.
[time=2920] That means that the whole Bible is the territory that needs to be preached all of the counsel of God.
[time=2925] And frankly men and women there are some parts of that book I wish I didn't have to preach.
[time=2933] There are some parts I'd like to leapfrog over on my way to something more exciting.
[time=2937] I don't really relish the thought of preparing a strong expositional message on the doctrine of hell, but it needs to be preached because it's in the book.
[time=2950] And that takes us back again to the reason for expositional preaching because you see expositional preaching is consecutive teaching through a book.
[time=2961] And if you teach through a book consecutively you're gonna get a balanced diet.
[time=2965] If you're a topical preacher or if you're always banging away at your pet peeve whether it be prophecy or whatever pretty soon you're gonna have a stilted diet and you're going to feed your people your own self interest.
[time=2977] Frankly if I didn't preach expositionally I'd be preaching biographically every Sunday because I love to preach on the men and the women of the Bible.
[time=2986] But that isn't a good diet for us.
[time=2988] We need to have the whole counsel of God, the good, the bad and the indifferent.
[time=2992] What God says we need to say.
[time=2994] Back when we were in the chapel when the church first started several years ago a young couple came to see me one week and they asked if I would marry them.
[time=3006] And I began to talk to them and discovered that the young lady professed to be a Christian but her boyfriend was unsaved.
[time=3013] I've discovered something in the years of ministry that oftentimes premarital counseling is not necessarily the best time for evangelistic fervor.
[time=3022] I believe I've had many converts in premarital counseling who proved out later to be only interested in one thing and that is getting married.
[time=3030] But I began to talk to this young man about the Lord and I discovered he had no desire whatsoever to receive Christ.
[time=3037] He said I'm not interested in the gospel, I don't want anything to do with the church, I don't believe the Bible, I just wanna get married.
[time=3044] Well, I gulped, I believe this was my first such encounter with a young couple and I said I'm sorry, I can't marry you because the Bible says that you're not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers.
[time=3054] And I won't marry you.
[time=3057] I'd love to, I am not angry with you but I can't do it.
[time=3060] Well, I'm telling you he got up out of his chair and he was bigger than I was and he stomped out of my office and he slammed the door and back then our church was right next to a gravel parking lot where we all parked, he got in his car and he peeled rubber and threw stones up against that metal building and I heard him all the way out to the street.
[time=3079] He was mad.
[time=3082] And I didn't see him again for several weeks.
[time=3085] One Sunday morning I was on the platform of the chapel getting ready to preach.
[time=3091] We were having our song service and I looked out and there was that couple.
[time=3094] They had gone downtown through a liberal preacher and gotten married and now they'd come back to church for the first time.
[time=3100] Of course, when you don't have many people you can see everybody and I saw him, I saw him clearly.
[time=3106] I didn't think too much about it 'til I looked down at my sermon for that day.
[time=3110] I was preaching through the book of Malachi and on that Sunday I was preaching on the subject of the sin of being unequally yoked together with foreign people.
[time=3120] And I said, "God, do I have to preach this today?"
[time=3126] (audience laughs) Isn't there something else?
[time=3129] I started thinking through all the sermons I had almost memorized that I could say that the Lord had suddenly laid a new burden on my heart and I'd like to share some new truth.
[time=3137] And the Lord just sort of spoke in my spirit and he said, "That's the message I gave you, my friend.
[time=3144] "You preach it." So I said, "Okay, Lord, but I'm not looking at him." (audience laughs) And I preached it and they came out the door
[time=3158] and if he was mad the first time he was mad at the second time.
[time=3162] But you know what I heard about four weeks later that that young man had come to know Christ as a savior.
[time=3167] You see, if you're preaching the whole council of God you can't shun to preach any of it.
[time=3173] You have to preach everything that's there, the good, the bad and the indifferent.
[time=3176] You can't be like the messenger boy who said, "I'll take any telegram you want except one "and has bad news in it." And Paul was saying to the Ephesian elders, "I have declared to you the whole council of God.
[time=3189] "I have kept back nothing that was profitable "to you.
[time=3193] "I wish I could feel that in my own heart, 100%.
[time=3195] "But if I don't feel it, that's been the motivation "behind it, not to cut the word of God "where I want it to be cut, but to open it up "in its entirety and say, "Thus saith the Lord, "to preach the word of God exhaustively." Then fourthly, to preach the word of God encouragingly.
[time=3215] Verse two of this chapter tells about Paul's journey around Asia Minor and he said he'd gone over those parts and he'd given them much and the word exhortation is the word from which we get our word encouragement, the word paraclete.
[time=3229] He gave them much encouragement.
[time=3233] And I've discovered something in these years of preaching and I think it was my father who first told me this.
[time=3237] Years ago when I started to preach he said, "David find out where people are hurting "and find the word of God and drop it in the hurt "and you'll discover that they'll respond." I look back over the years of preaching here and I can pick out in my mind the messages to which people have most responded.
[time=3254] And generally speaking they've been the messages that have addressed the hurts that they feel.
[time=3260] Paul's ministry around in his preaching tour was a ministry of encouragement, drawing upside along folks with the word of God and helping them through the trials as he taught the word to them.
[time=3271] And our preaching ought to be not just the declaration of cold and indifferent truth, the sterility of intellectual pursuit, but it ought to be truth applied to life, encouraging people and lifting them up and helping them through the rough places.
[time=3289] And you say does the Bible address that theme on almost every page, you will find it.
[time=3294] And Paul used the word of God as a method of encouragement.
[time=3298] Last but not least, the scripture says that our preaching ought to be exhortative.
[time=3307] In verses 29, 30 and 31, Paul says some very, very serious things.
[time=3312] He said, "After I'm gone, grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them, therefore watch and remember, that for the space of three years, I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears." What is he saying?
[time=3337] He's saying, "When I'm gone, there will be an attempt," said Paul, "for some to rise up among you and draw disciples after them." He says that the problems in the church are twofold.
[time=3350] There are some from inside and some from outside.
[time=3353] The inside attacks are from Satan leading weak and immature believers into a counterfeit doctrine and bringing about the possibility of dissension, like happened in the church of Corinth, where somewhere after Paul and somewhere after a policy, they had their own little societies growing up within the body.
[time=3372] It came about because people got their eyes off of the central purpose of the church.
[time=3377] Diatrophies, disease, men and women is not dead.
[time=3380] It's alive and well.
[time=3382] People who love to have the preeminence, and Paul said, "I'm warning you against that problem, and I'm asking you to take seriously what I'm saying." It is no wonder that when he wrote to Timothy, Paul, again, prioritized his ministry.
[time=3398] He said to him, "Timothy, preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.
[time=3413] The first priority of the church is the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=3418] Shall we pray?
[time=3421] God in heaven?
