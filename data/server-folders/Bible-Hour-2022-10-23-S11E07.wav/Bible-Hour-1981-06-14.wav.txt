[time=0] (Bell)
[time=30] >>From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=36] we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jerramon.
[time=40] >>Bring our heart, let's sing my soul, my sister, my queen.
[time=50] (Singing)
[time=66] >>Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=68] >>We're happy to welcome all of you here to the second hour of worship.
[time=76] We had a great crowd in the first hour and are grateful now to welcome you as we share together around the Word of God and the music of the faith.
[time=85] For those of you who have joined us now by television, we're grateful to have you here and it's one of our great privileges to open the doors of this church wide enough so that many who aren't able to be here can share with us as we worship our Lord together.
[time=99] Foundation of our worship is the Bible, the Word of God, speaks to us of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. In an age when everything is changing and all around us we see decay,
[time=111] it is great to know that the Word of God still stands true.
[time=116] That's the theme of the song our choir is singing for us.
[time=120] They're under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=142] [MUSIC - 151 seconds]
[time=299] Thank you choir. We have not had a pulpit guest for a long time but today we have one and he does
[time=306] not come from afar. He's a part of our own body but he's just about ready to leave for an
[time=312] assignment from God that will take him to Germany. I want you to meet Mr. Denny Howard who is a part
[time=318] of our fellowship. He is served here with the Youth for Christ organization and now is being
[time=324] transferred by God and by the organization to Germany. Denny you're going to Germany for a
[time=330] very special kind of ministry and really it's the first time I've ever heard of an organization having a specialized ministry in that way. What will be the focus of your ministry there?
[time=340] The newest aspects of Youth for Christ International Ministries is a ministry to the youngsters of
[time=346] military personnel and the specific place I'm going is Augsburg Germany. I just received a letter
[time=353] from one of the personnel there who said something you can anticipate is that the kids who have
[time=361] never had priority that there are 30,000 military kids in Germany alone and only 6% of them have
[time=369] any kind of spiritual input. For example in my area there is no chapel, youth chapel. There
[time=376] is nothing for the Christian kids. There is an outreach to non-Christian kids but nothing for the Christian kids and that burdens me that the Christian youngsters have no way to grow. So I'll be director of outreach and also the director of the youth chapel working on the local chapel in there. Denny these young people are not German young people.
[time=397] They're American young people aren't they? The children of our people who are based there
[time=403] in Germany and you will be not crossing a language barrier but from what you've told me there is a cultural barrier you have to worry about isn't there?
[time=411] Yes I've been informed that much to probably my surprise that the military community is
[time=418] probably just as hard to adapt to as the German community. I'll be living in the German community but working in the military community. It is a different culture.
[time=428] You were sharing with me this week as we were talking about our discussion today on television that through this whole process as God has been leading in your life you've gone through some real low places of discouragement and some real difficulty in fighting this out with the
[time=445] Lord. Maybe you ought to tell us a little bit about that.
[time=447] Yes I received a letter from a staff person there and I had asked what are the real problems
[time=454] where the real situations when I received that letter I just kind of go oh God you call the wrong person. You know the task and I think many of us have task and situations in our
[time=465] life that seem bigger than we are. I heard Chuck Swindle say this and it has kind of stuck
[time=471] me. We're all faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as impossible
[time=478] situations. They are not impossible for God only for us. A verse Jeremiah 3227 God's word
[time=490] comes to Jeremiah saying I am your Lord the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult
[time=496] for me and God has asked me the same question. I have to say no. No that he is given the
[time=503] task and it will give me the equipment to do it.
[time=506] Anyway you go we're all going to be here holding the ropes for you. How can we pray for you intelligently so that God will have maximum impact through your life in Germany.
[time=516] I have a prayer request and if you forget it you can find it in Colossians 4. It says this that I will devote myself to much prayer myself that God will now open doors even though
[time=528] I am not there. That I will proclaim his message the message of Jesus Christ and what he has
[time=534] done for us with clarity. That I will act with wisdom toward outsiders and that's important those people who are skeptical of what we are doing. That I will act with wisdom toward them. That I will make the best of each opportunity and lastly that my conversation will be full
[time=550] in every day, season with salt that I will know how to answer every man.
[time=554] Amen. Well that's great and I wish we could make it possible for everyone here just to file up and shake your hand and say God bless you. We can't do that but we can put our hands together and let you know that we are going to be praying for you that we love you and we thank God that he's letting you represent us there and represent the Lord in Germany as well. Thank you Dennis.
[time=580] I think the most exciting thing that ever happens in a church is when its young people get excited about serving God and take off to do that with a real abandon to do whatever
[time=590] God wants them to do and that's certainly been true of Denny's life and we've got some more that are leaving for the summer too and we're going to be telling you about them in the weeks ahead. Right now we're going to have some more music and David Miller is going to sing for us.
[time=602] [MUSIC]
[time=609] The highest praise is more than spoken word. It's what my heart would say. All I have to
[time=619] offer you in my small way is to live for you.
[time=628] [MUSIC]
[time=634] Father, the more you've given me your love and pulled me off, the more my praise is not enough.
[time=656] You said he who would go first go last and so I pray that you'll be first in all I ask.
[time=682] The highest praise is more than spoken word. It's what my heart would say. All I have
[time=693] to offer you in my small way is to live for you.
[time=707] The highest praise to not to hear and not to say you died for me.
[time=717] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently for all you do.
[time=732] The highest praise I can give to you is to live my life for you.
[time=758] [MUSIC]
[time=763] Thank you so much for being with us today and we're especially happy that you're sharing with us these series of messages that we're giving in the summer on the priorities of the church.
[time=773] I'll be giving the second in that series of messages in just a few moments but Don and I have this opportunity to talk with you now as we share these moments of very informal chatter with you
[time=784] at home and to share with you some of the information that will be of help to you in your own Christian life and in your participation in the Bible our ministry. Don I know you have some things to say in just a moment
[time=795] but before you do that let me encourage these folks to write to us this week and participate in Bible
[time=801] study through the use of a very exciting new Bible study tool that we want to offer to you absolutely free is our gift.

[time=842] to that Bible study series as you're reading through the Bible you can have this little booklet with you and as you come upon something in your reading that you don't understand it's very probable that the answer to that question
[time=853] will be found in this companion booklet four thousand questions and answers from the Bible
[time=859] and we'd like to give it to you this week as our free gift it's absolutely free to all who will write or call
[time=865] and Donna's going to tell you how to do that because it's very important that you listen carefully and take down this information.

[time=923] WHME and Goshen Indiana and these folks have had a part in underwriting today's broadcast in those areas
[time=930] and we certainly thank you for your part in this ministry. Donna an associate's sponsor is someone who gives a hundred
[time=936] dollars toward a telecast in their area and a full sponsor is someone who underwrites the entire cost
[time=942] of a television program on a given Sunday where they happen to view the Bible hour if you're interested in
[time=948] participating in the sponsors program all you have to do is get in touch with us and we'll be happy to send you information. Now before we go back to our service this morning I just want to remind you that recently I've written to all of you in the Bible our family encouraging you to participate in the support of this ministry
[time=964] the letter should be in all of your homes by the time you are participating in today's program if you receive the letter I hope you'll take time this week to sit down and ponder what you can do to be a part of
[time=975] keeping this ministry on the air as we preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to the many people in this area
[time=981] we need your help and we thank each and every one of you who have helped us already and will be helping us in the days
[time=987] ahead without you we couldn't do this we need your help and we thank you for being with us in this ministry
[time=994] now in just a few moments we're going to open the Word of God for the second in the series of messages the priorities of the church
[time=1000] I hope you'll share with us as we study God's Word together on the Bible hour.
[time=1024] Today we're going to tell all this power every day and every hour.
[time=1030] I'm going to lift up a wonderful name.
[time=1040] Well it won't have reason to worry.
[time=1046] Our days I just get to hold.
[time=1050] I can see and remember.
[time=1054] You'll be lonely when I'm crazy.
[time=1058] You'll be afraid to love the Lord.
[time=1061] I love that blessed name.
[time=1064] And that made me wonder.
[time=1066] Made highly worthy.
[time=1070] It was whispered I know.
[time=1074] In my heart won't look long.
[time=1077] To Jesus my life I dear.
[time=1082] I'm going to lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=1087] I'm going to sing love my choice and seek change.
[time=1092] I'm going to tell all this power every day and every hour.
[time=1098] I'm going to lift up a wonderful name.
[time=1109] Jesus oh how sweet the name.
[time=1114] Jesus every day and saves.
[time=1119] Jesus what our saints proclaim.
[time=1124] It's worthy praise.
[time=1127] Oh I love you.
[time=1132] I'm going to lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=1137] I'm going to sing love my choice and seek change change.
[time=1142] I'm going to tell all this power every day and every hour.
[time=1147] I'm going to lift up a wonderful name.
[time=1166] That precious name is Jesus.
[time=1182] It was the Black Hawk Singers and Master Kruger sharing with them in that musical medley.
[time=1188] We appreciate it so much.
[time=1190] Just before the message this morning we're going to hear a favorite old hymn.
[time=1195] God leads us along the leading of the Lord and its message put to music and we're listening to the ministry of Maria Gardner.
[time=1203] Maria God bless you.
[time=1212] All the way my Savior leads me.
[time=1221] What have I to ask beside?
[time=1226] Can I doubt His tender mercy who through life has been my guide?
[time=1237] Heavenly peace, divinest comfort.
[time=1243] Here by faith in Him to dwell.
[time=1249] For I know what air before me.
[time=1255] Jesus do with all things well.
[time=1261] For I know what air before me.
[time=1267] Jesus do with all things well.
[time=1286] All the way my Savior leads me.
[time=1292] Oh the fullness of His love.
[time=1296] Perfect rest to me is promised in my Father's house above.
[time=1307] When my spirit clothed immortal, wings its flight to realms of day.
[time=1317] This my song through endless ages.
[time=1323] Jesus led me all the way.
[time=1329] This my song through endless ages.
[time=1339] Jesus led me all the way.
[time=1358] Thank you Maria, that was good, appreciate it so much.
[time=1362] Open your Bibles to the 20th chapter of the book of Acts.
[time=1366] Acts chapter 20, a great chapter in this New Testament book of history
[time=1373] that contains at least in incipient form all of the major ingredients
[time=1379] of the priorities of the church.
[time=1382] Last week we began this series of messages on the priorities of the church and the priority that we discussed together was the priority of preaching.
[time=1391] Today we are looking together at the priority of people.
[time=1396] I want to read Acts chapter 20 verses 35 through 38 where we get a glimpse of Paul's relationship with the people
[time=1407] with whom God had allowed him to serve in the city of Ephesus.
[time=1412] Acts chapter 20 verse 35.
[time=1416] And I have shown you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[time=1428] And when he had thus spoken he knelt down and prayed with them all and they all wept much and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him, siring most of all for the words which he spoke that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship.
[time=1444] Shall we pray together?
[time=1448] Our God as we read the word of God we are grateful beyond words that it is not just a systematic rehearsal of spiritual truth,
[time=1459] but that so much of it is spiritual truth embodied in the lives of people
[time=1465] and that through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and the accurate recording of the writers of the New Testament we can actually sit down and watch God at work in the lives of men like Paul and the Ephesian elders.
[time=1482] We can see that truth take on flesh and blood and live before us and somehow it communicates to us at a deeper level than if it were just didactic information.
[time=1494] Our Father we pray that today as we explore this concept of the importance of people in the priorities of the Church, that as we look at much information, as we review many passages of Scripture, that the one major impact that will come from our study together will be a realization that God places a premium on his people
[time=1519] and we ought to do the same.
[time=1522] I pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1528] The first priority of the Church is the preaching of the Word of God and the activity of the priority is feeding the flock.
[time=1538] The second priority of the Church is people and the activity is fellowship.
[time=1546] Preaching and feeding, people and fellowship.
[time=1552] If I were to read the following names to you, what would you say they have in common?
[time=1560] Tikikas, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Marcus, Jesus, Epifras,
[time=1569] lemis, justice and archapace?
[time=1573] Well, you say the one thing they have in common pastor is that you can hardly pronounce them and they sound like they came from a different age and you're right about both.
[time=1582] But what they really have in common is this.
[time=1584] They are the names of people that Paul mentioned at the end of his letter to the Colossian believers.
[time=1591] Try these on for size.
[time=1593] Stephanus, Fortuenatus, Archaeus, Aquila and Priscilla.
[time=1598] You'll find their names at the end of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1602] The list in Romans is so vast I wouldn't even tackle it in a public service.
[time=1607] But try these on, Prisca and Aquila, Onus, Epherus, Erastus, Trophimus, Eubulus, Putans, Linus and Claudia.
[time=1615] You know where they come from?
[time=1617] Well, those are the names at the end of Paul's letter to Timothy, his second letter to Timothy.
[time=1622] And Titus has these names attached to the letter, Artemis, Tikikas, Nicopolis, Zenus and Apollus.
[time=1631] And the little book of Philemon, which has only 25 verses, devotes two of those verses to the mentioning of the names of people that were important to Paul as he wrote to that young man, Epifras, Mark, Erastarchus, Demas and Luke.
[time=1645] You say, "Pastor, what's the meaning of the rehearsal of all of these very difficult names?" I find it most interesting.
[time=1652] Usually we pass over those verses, feeling that we have quite finished the book by the time we arrive there.
[time=1658] But taken together in all of the letters that Paul has written, we get just a bit of an insight into his priority on people.
[time=1666] In one place in the New Testament, Paul speaks of his care of all the churches.
[time=1672] And I am amazed that in his care of all the churches, to whom he wrote these letters,
[time=1678] in his responsibility and administrative detail, he never lost sight of the individuals to whom he ministered.
[time=1686] And in each of the churches, there were special people that God put on his heart.
[time=1691] And whenever he wrote to the people in that church, he always asked after them.
[time=1695] He always spoke their names.
[time=1697] The people of God were important to Paul.
[time=1701] It's quite interesting to me that in these first two priorities, the preaching and the people, we have an insight into the highest priorities of God.
[time=1712] And you say to me, "Pastor, how can you be so sure those are his highest priorities?" Well, listen folks, those are the only two things that are going to survive this world.
[time=1721] Everything else will go away.
[time=1724] Everything else will be dissolved.
[time=1727] But the two things that will survive this world into the next are God's people and His Word.
[time=1733] Isn't it interesting that if we place our priorities where God does, we always have the evidence of God's blessing on our ministries and in our lives.
[time=1742] When we get our priorities diffused over many other things, we lose the impact God would have us to sustain in behalf of Him in this world today.
[time=1752] The Word of God and preaching, the people of God and fellowship.
[time=1758] Now the Bible is very clear that in the church, we have two basic principles that are held in tension.
[time=1764] Sometimes we get these out of tension and we don't understand what God is saying to us.
[time=1769] But the two principles are these.
[time=1771] It's the principle of unity and the principle of diversity.
[time=1775] And you can't have one without the other.
[time=1778] Every one of the figures of the church, every one of the pictures of the church, bring these things together.
[time=1784] Let me see if I can illustrate what I mean.
[time=1787] In the Bible, we are told that the church is the bride of Christ and Christ is the bridegroom.
[time=1792] And yet wherever that principle is taught, we always see that the bride is made up of all of the various Christians who are awaiting the time when the rapture will come and the bride and the bridegroom will be brought together.
[time=1805] There is one bridegroom but the bride is made up of the whole body.
[time=1809] We are told that the Lord Jesus Christ is the great shepherd and we are the many sheep of His one fold.
[time=1816] We are told that the Lord Jesus Christ is the vine and we are the many branches of that one vine.
[time=1822] We are told that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one king and we are the many subjects of His one kingdom.
[time=1828] We are taught in the Word of God that there is one Father, even our Lord Jesus Christ, but we are the many children of the one family.
[time=1836] We are taught in the Word of God that there is one head and we are the many members of the one body.
[time=1841] We are taught in the Scripture that there is one foundation but we are the many parts of the one building.
[time=1848] So we have the concept of unity and the concept of diversity held in tension as it relates to the Scripture,
[time=1855] as it relates to the church.
[time=1857] The Bible says that the church is made up of God's people who have to function together within the body
[time=1864] in order that they might show a picture of unity to the world, and yet within that body are those who come from diverse backgrounds
[time=1872] and so there is the unity and the diversity.
[time=1875] The outward picture made up of all of the people who participate together in the body of Christ.
[time=1880] And if you are a part of this church or any other church, you know that you don't have to be in a church five minutes
[time=1886] to discover the principle of diversity.
[time=1888] You learn that as soon as you walk in that people aren't just exactly like you are, and it's that wonderful thing that God does
[time=1895] when He brings the diversity together and creates out of it a beautiful unity that fellowship is all about.
[time=1901] That's what the term really means in the Scripture.
[time=1904] Now in the Bible there are two words that are translated from the one word fellowship.
[time=1910] One of the words that we see often in the New Testament is the word communion.
[time=1914] The word communion often translates the word Koinonia, which is the Greek word for fellowship.
[time=1920] And then other times we see the actual word fellowship translated in the Scriptures.
[time=1925] And when we talk about Koinonia or fellowship or communion, what we're talking about is having something in common with another person.
[time=1934] I remember hearing Dr. Ray Stedman preach in the chapel of Dallas Seminary when I was a student there.
[time=1940] He said something that I wrote down and I've never forgotten.
[time=1944] He said the Church of Jesus Christ is quite like a group of porcupines on a cold winter's night.
[time=1951] He said they need the warmth of each other to keep away the cold and the outside intruders who would injure them.
[time=1958] But just the minute that they get together in close association they begin to jab each other and they have to move apart again.
[time=1965] If you know anything at all about church life you know exactly what Dr. Stedman was talking about.
[time=1970] We need each other desperately. We need close fellowship and close association. That's unity.
[time=1975] But as soon as we get together the quills of our diversity begin to manifest themselves and we are forced apart.
[time=1982] And so the Christian life quite often takes on the role of coming together, moving apart and coming together and moving apart as we struggle to know the unity which God would have for us in the concept of fellowship.
[time=1994] God's priority on people is very evident in the activity which He has given to us as people to carry on in His name.
[time=2003] Now I wish this morning that we could take our Bibles and all of us take time to look up every passage of Scripture that I want to share with you.
[time=2010] But some of you aren't as fast in turning the pages as others and none of you are fast enough to follow what I'm going to do.
[time=2017] But you can write down the references and I hope you'll do that and when you get a chance read the references so that in your mind as you think about fellowship you will know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=2029] Men and brethren and sisters and children and young people and all of you we have some of the craziest ideas about fellowship that you can imagine.
[time=2039] And I hear them every week. Pastor let's go down to halls and have a little fellowship together.
[time=2045] What we have when we go to halls is coffee and we talk about baseball and we talk about what's going on in the community and that's wonderful and it's fun but that's not fellowship.
[time=2056] Or pastor why don't you come on over tonight there's a pro football game on we could have a little fellowship together and we come over and we watch the pro football game and what happens is the men get out of fellowship with their wives and that's not fellowship.
[time=2070] What is fellowship? We use the term so glibly within the church but what are we talking about?
[time=2076] Well the Scripture is very clear as it defines carefully for us what that word means.
[time=2083] Here are some passages of Scripture where I am going to read the word fellowship as it is translated as we ought to understand it and I think you'll have an understanding of what I mean.
[time=2093] 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14.
[time=2096] What things does light have in common with darkness and the words have in common translate the word coinonia fellowship?
[time=2105] What things does light have in common with darkness? 1 John 1, 3.
[time=2111] These things right we unto you that you may have joint participation or fellowship with us and our fellowship is in the Son in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2121] Here John is talking about joining together having in common the things of God.
[time=2126] 1 Corinthians 10 16. The cup of blessing which we bless. Is it not a joint participation or a communion or a fellowship?
[time=2136] The bread which we break. Is it not a joint participation a having in common together?
[time=2143] In the communion service according to the writer of Corinthians we participate together in unity.
[time=2149] We have in common the bread and the cup we come together to share the same things that's what fellowship is.
[time=2157] The word coinonia is a word which speaks of having in common of participating together with of sharing in the same things.
[time=2167] Now it's interesting to me that in the New Testament there are basically four activities which are designated as fellowship by the writers of the New Testament literature.
[time=2177] For activities and if we are involved in fellowship these activities will be a part of what we're doing when we're quote unquote "fellowshipping one with another".
[time=2187] First of all the word is often used of that which happens when we come together around the Lord's table for the communion time for what we call the Lord's Supper.
[time=2198] In 1 Corinthians 10 16 and 17 which I referred to a moment ago we read these words.
[time=2204] The cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ.
[time=2209] The fellowship the coinonia of the blood of Christ.
[time=2213] In this passage Paul in the book of Corinthians is making a protest against Christians participating in the idolatrous feasts of his day.
[time=2223] We had time to study the argument of the passage you would understand it in this way.
[time=2227] Christians in Corinth were going to the feasts of the idols and they were eating the meat that was offered to idols and they were participating in the feasts of the pagans.
[time=2236] And Paul says don't you understand that when you do that you actually bring yourself into a kind of close fellowship with Satan, with demons, with the pagan gods.
[time=2247] And then he builds upon that platform of instruction to say that when we come together around the Lord's table and when we participate in the cup and in the bread and with each other we participate in common in fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2263] Now most of you who have been in our communion services which we call the family circle know how very wonderfully that is played out in the whole service that is planned for that night.
[time=2275] We come together with microphones in each of the isles for people to come and share from their heart one with the other and they share their joys and their burdens and their blessings and their problems.
[time=2286] And we all participate together as a body in what God is doing among us and then usually at the end of that time we gather in small groups and we pray one for another.
[time=2297] We share together the fellowship of the burdens and of the joys and of the good times.
[time=2302] And I like to think that that's the Christians foot washing service.
[time=2306] John chapter 13 speaks of the disciples submitting one to another and of course the Lord set the example as he served them by washing their feet.
[time=2316] When we come together to share with each other in the way that we do in our communion service we are submitting ourselves one to another.
[time=2322] I'm telling you the joys and burdens of my life and you're telling me the joys and burdens of your lives and we are coming together around what we have in common in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2333] Then about halfway through that service we say now folks we're going to stop the fellowship now this way and we're going to take all of our attention as we have been brought together as a common group through the things we have in common in Christ
[time=2347] and focus all of that attention now on the Lord Jesus Christ and we serve the elements of communion to all of the body and the wine speaks of his blood and the bread speaks of his body and we share all of that together and that's a kind of oneness that we have.
[time=2362] And so many of you have come to say to me Pastor Jeremiah I never feel so close to the members of this church and so close to Jesus Christ as I do when I share in the family circle.
[time=2374] Well Paul says that's fellowship that's Koinonia so when you come to church on the 12th of July in the morning you can turn to your neighbor and say tonight let's have some fellowship together and invite them to communion.
[time=2389] Some of them need to be invited maybe you better stop by their house and bring them with you so we can fellowship together around the Lord's table.
[time=2397] The first activity of fellowship is the communion supper.
[time=2400] Now I want you to notice secondly that the second activity of the communion supper or the second activity of fellowship is the community of goods.
[time=2409] Most people that I know who have studied the second chapter of the book of Acts get very perturbed when they read about the early Christians having all things in common and there's the word again.
[time=2420] They had all things Koinonia in common Acts 242 and I have actually had college students tell me that Acts chapter 2 is a biblical basis for communism.
[time=2432] I mean that's where it is communism came right out of the early church right out of Acts chapter 2.
[time=2438] Now there are four terms in Acts chapter 2 that speak of what the new church Christians had in common.
[time=2445] The verse says this that they taught they studied they had the breaking of bread they had prayers and then they had all things in common.
[time=2454] That means that they interchanged with one another the needs within the body.
[time=2460] I like to think that we've had that experience in the Black Hawk Baptist Church in a number of ways.
[time=2465] Some of you who've been around here for a while remember the fifty dollar phantom.
[time=2469] Do you remember him? We never have yet found out who he was.
[time=2473] But for about five months in a row in our family circle sharing time people would get up and talk about the fact that they'd had a real deep need in their life.
[time=2482] And that they really hadn't shared that with too many people but that that week they got an envelope in the mail and it was an envelope that had a little note in it.
[time=2490] God bless you or whatever we're praying for you during this time and a crisp new fifty dollar bill enclosed in the note.
[time=2498] No name. And the next week somebody else would get up and they got one and one week a person got two of them in the same envelope.
[time=2505] The fifty dollar phantom struck again.
[time=2508] And we all laughed about that and everybody around the staff was guessing as to who was doing it and I'm sure we'll never know till we get to heaven.
[time=2515] But what a beautiful illustration of what was going on in the early church.
[time=2520] When someone in the body had a need someone over here who was doing better at that time would meet that need within the body.
[time=2527] So that what God had blessed each of them with he had blessed all of them with.
[time=2531] It was not forced sharing of goods which is what communism is and let me prove to you that.
[time=2538] You remember when Barnabas who was in that early group gave a great offering to the church and he gave all of the proceeds of what God had given to him to the church.
[time=2547] And then Ananias and Sephira got so fired up over the acclaim that Barnabas got that they decided they'd do the same thing and they sold a piece of property.
[time=2555] And when they got all that money in their hands they started to count it and they thought wow I don't think I want to give all this to God.
[time=2561] So they kept part of it back and yet they let everybody in the church believe that they'd given it all to the church.
[time=2567] And then you know what happened Ananias and Sephira were disciplined by God.
[time=2573] It's kind of funny to read it it says you know the Lord zapped Ananias and about five seconds later his wife came in and he zapped her and they took him out and buried him.
[time=2581] Which is pretty stern discipline for lying to the Holy Spirit but that's what they did.
[time=2586] Now in the passage this is what it says when they were being accosted for their sin they were told these words.
[time=2594] While it was in your hands was it not thine own to do with as you pleased.
[time=2600] It didn't belong to the church it wasn't forced community of goods it belonged to them but there was such a fellowship and a love within that body that they shared all things together.
[time=2612] And when there was a need it was met by the other people within the congregation.
[time=2616] Someone that I know wrote that poverty may be able to exist in some places in the world but the one place where it ought never to exist is in the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2627] The sharing back and forth of what God has done for us with those to whom problems are very prevalent is a part of the concept of fellowship.
[time=2639] So we have two things so far that we learn about fellowship.
[time=2643] One it is that which we do when we gather at the Lord's table.
[time=2647] Number two it is that which we do when we share with one another in the goods and in the blessings that God has provided for us.
[time=2655] Then number three and this is where people think you have stopped preaching and you started to meddle in their lives.
[time=2662] The word coinonia is used more often in the epistles for the concept of giving of one's money to the things of God through the church than for anything else.
[time=2674] Now some of you say pastor it doesn't make any difference where you start and what concept you're preaching somehow you always manage to get back to stewardship.
[time=2682] And I suppose there may be some truth to that but you see stewardship is the very stuff of life isn't it.
[time=2688] It's the overwhelming concept that holds all of Christianity together.
[time=2692] And over and over again in the New Testament we are told that to give to contribute is to be involved in fellowship.
[time=2698] Now let me just read some verses to you.
[time=2700] Romans 12, 13 speaks of the coinonia to the necessity of the saints.
[time=2706] Distributing to the necessity of the saints is fellowship according to that particular passage.
[time=2713] 1 Timothy 6, 17 and 18 listen to this one.
[time=2716] Charge them that are rich in this age that they do good that they be ready to fellowship and the word there is the word distribute.
[time=2725] In other words that they be ready to be involved in fellowship by giving of their goods.
[time=2730] Hebrews 13, 16 but to do good and to share there's the word again coinonia.
[time=2737] Over and over and over again in the New Testament we're told that we fellowship with God and with His people when we take that which God has entrusted to us and we share it together for the cause of Christ.
[time=2750] Now if I were to ask you when in the service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church do we have the greatest evidence of fellowship.
[time=2757] I doubt very seriously whether too many of you would write down during the offering but let me show you how that works.
[time=2765] Each week you leave this place and you go out into the marketplace and you work and part of you is given to the marketplace.
[time=2776] You actually bargain with yourself and you say here am I I will let you have 40 hours of me this week.
[time=2786] And in exchange for my giving you 40 hours of me you give me back coins which represent what I have invested in you and now I take that in its mind to invest where I please.
[time=2800] And then you come to church on Sunday and the offering plate is passed and you take a certain portion of that of of you which you have invested in the marketplace and it's now been put into a coin that you can use to transfer you to another kingdom.
[time=2813] And you take that which is you and you put it in the offering plate and so when they walk out of here with the offering plates they walk out of here with a part of you and a part of you and a part of you and a part of you and we're all in there together.
[time=2826] And part of us is all in that offering plate together and then they put it into a common account and the needs of the church are met as we have fellowship together in the offering.
[time=2837] Now I didn't make that up that's what the scripture teaches the Bible says that when we participate with ourselves in the giving of goods that according to the New Testament literature is coin O'Neill it is fellowship.
[time=2852] Now the last one that I want to share with you the last activity of fellowship is the activity of cooperation in the Lord's work.
[time=2863] The very wonderful passage in the book of Philippians we read in Philippians one five I thank God now listen for your coin O'Neill in the gospel of Jesus Christ Paul said to the Philippians I give thanks to God for your fellowship in the work of the gospel.
[time=2882] You know there's not anything at all the world that's quite like the fellowship you have with those who are of like precious faith if you've ever seen me around here when my pastor buddies come to town you know what I'm talking about.
[time=2895] There's something about being with another pastor that's very special to every preacher I know and in the church body itself there's something very special about the workers in the church it's sort of like an inner core of unity within the larger body.
[time=2911] If you're in this church and you don't do anything to serve God here you feel like an outsider I can tell you that right now.
[time=2918] The people who are serving God here in the Sunday School in the choir in the children's churches in all of the ministries they form a kind of inner fellowship core and you feel so very close to those people because you are coin O'Neill together in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2937] And those who aren't a part of that never really feel a part of the church they sit on the outside as spectators instead of participators and they don't enjoy the real blessing that we have together as a part of God's family.
[time=2951] There is a kind of special relationship that comes in the fellowship of the workers of the gospel.
[time=2960] Now those are four activities the Bible says our fellowship the communion supper the contribution to the Lord's work the holding in things in common together within the body and in the sharing of the Lord's work together.
[time=2974] And that's what it means to fellowship so we can honestly say I'm going out to fellowship in evangelism tonight.
[time=2981] I'm going to fellowship in the Lord's supper tonight.
[time=2984] I've got to run a little fellowship over to a person who's in need today.
[time=2988] That's what the term means to have it in common and the activity of God's people is that you see it's the interaction.
[time=2996] We've had a lot of pastors come and share in our family circle service here since we've been doing this.
[time=3002] Some of them have done what we do the next Sunday when they go home.
[time=3008] They go home and they put microphones in each aisle and they tell everybody.
[time=3012] Now tonight we're going to have family circle and they've come back to report to me the disaster of that attempt.
[time=3018] Pastor nobody did anything they just sat there.
[time=3022] It was embarrassing.
[time=3024] I'd like to share with them that we didn't just start that on a given night.
[time=3029] Some of you who've been in this church long enough remember that for a period of about three months on Wednesday nights
[time=3035] we taught a series of messages on the principles of the body reciprocating one to another.
[time=3043] And each week we talked about something else that we're to do with one another in the church.
[time=3049] And we taught how we share together with one another and that it is God's word to us to so function.
[time=3055] I wish I could go back and give a little treatise on each one of them but I'd like to remind you of what we're to do with one another in the body just to give you the references and you can think through.
[time=3066] But at least ten times in the New Testament we are told that as Christians we have a responsibility one to another the reciprocal relationship within the fellow shipping body of Christ.
[time=3079] In Romans 12.5 we are told that we are members one of another.
[time=3085] In Romans 12.10 we are told that we are to be devoted one to another.
[time=3091] In Romans 12.10 we're told we are to honor one another above ourselves.
[time=3097] In Romans 15.5 we are told that we are to be of the same mind one with another.
[time=3105] In Romans 15.7 we are told that we are to accept one another.
[time=3115] We talk to exhort one another much of that goes on in the family circle services.
[time=3120] In Romans 16 we are told we are to greet one another.
[time=3124] There it says with a holy kiss.
[time=3127] And in Galatians 5 verse 13 we are told that we are to serve one another.
[time=3134] And in Galatians 6 verse 2 we are told we are to bear one another's burdens.
[time=3141] Ephesians 4 tells us we are to be long suffering or we are to bear with one another.
[time=3147] Or a better translation is we are to put up with one another.
[time=3153] Ephesians 5 21 we are told to submit to one another.
[time=3157] Most often that truth gets lost while we're teaching the wife being submissive to her husband.
[time=3163] In that passage men and women it teaches that every Christian is to have a submissive attitude toward every other Christian.
[time=3169] Mutual submission.
[time=3171] Then we are told that we are to encourage one another.
[time=3174] Now what does this mean?
[time=3176] It means simply over and over again that the relationship within the body of Christ is always a reciprocal relationship.
[time=3183] We are always looking out for each other.
[time=3186] We are always ministering to each other. We are relating to one another as individuals in the body of Christ serving,
[time=3193] bearing up under ministering to having the same mind.
[time=3197] We do not walk within the body of Christ as if we had blinders on but we walk always in light of the people who walk alongside of us.
[time=3206] I remember reading something that Bruce Larson wrote some years ago.
[time=3212] I do not always espouse everything that he writes but one thing that I always do whenever I read what he writes I always think.
[time=3219] He makes me think about as good as anybody perhaps with the exception of Keith Miller.
[time=3224] In one of his books he talks about the church and its shortcoming in its relationships one with the other and its openness one to another and this is what he says.
[time=3234] He says the neighborhood bar is possibly the best counterfeit there is to the fellowship Christ wants us to have.
[time=3242] It is an imitation dispensing liquor instead of grace, escape instead of reality but it is a permissive accepting and inclusive fellowship.
[time=3254] It is unshockable, it is democratic, you can tell people secrets in a bar and they do not tell anybody else even if you do not ask them not to tell.
[time=3265] The bar flourishes not because most people are alcoholics but because God has put into the human heart the desire to know and to be known to love and to be loved and many people seek a counterfeit at the price of a few beers.
[time=3282] Christ wants his church to be unshockable, to be democratic, to be permissive, a fellowship where people can come in and say I am sunk, I am beat, I have had it and someone cares enough to listen and to do something about it.
[time=3301] The reason why new Christians can flourish in this congregation is because there is a climate here where they can be accepted for wherever they are in their stage of growth
[time=3310] and nobody is shocked at what they have not conquered yet in their spiritual journey.
[time=3316] And the kind of spirit that God wants us to have within the body as we prioritize people is that kind of interacting fellowship where we accept one another and minister to one another and where there is that easiness of being with God's people.
[time=3333] There is a legend and it is that not a true story but a legend about a man who went down to hell to look the place over.
[time=3343] And he saw everyone starving and wretched and dirty and after watching them for a while he discovered that the problem was that everybody in hell had stiff arms and they couldn't feed themselves or they couldn't take care of themselves.
[time=3360] The sight so depressed him that he was delighted when it was time for him to have a vision of heaven and so he left hell and he went to heaven and when he got there according to the legend.
[time=3369] In heaven everyone was sleek and healthy and laughing and happy.
[time=3374] It looked just the way heaven should but in his dream and in the legend he noticed that they also had stiff arms and couldn't feed themselves either.
[time=3385] But the thing that blew him away was that the people in heaven were feeding each other.
[time=3392] Do you know that is a real picture of the difference between the world and the church is it not?
[time=3399] The world would starve rather than reach out to someone else.
[time=3404] The church of Jesus Christ has been so constructed that our first priority is not this person but the person next to me.
[time=3413] And as long as my eyes are focused on his needs then while I'm feeding him his eyes are focused on me and my needs are being met too.
[time=3422] The priority of fellowship the activity of fellowship as we focus on the people of God.
[time=3430] May we never forget it in the days ahead shall we pray.
