[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Geromond.
[time=40] (audience chanting)
[time=60] (audience chanting) - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=72] - We're happy to have you here today,
[time=79] and we welcome you to this service.
[time=80] We have many visitors visiting with us in the services, both in the early hour and in this last morning worship service.
[time=88] Many of our friends who are attending the regular Baptist Conference, which will be held this week in Winona Lake, Indiana, and we're grateful to have you here, worshiping with us in this service.
[time=98] We're also very thankful for the privilege we have to share this ministry through television, many homes in this area, and around the Midwestern part of our country.
[time=107] We are anxious always to worship the Lord together, and we begin our worship with the ministry of our choir, and they're singing under the direction of Pastor Don Kruger.
[time=117] (audience chanting) [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=200] (audience chanting) [MUSIC - 123 seconds]
[time=331] Thank you, choir, for your ministry to us.
[time=334] Thank you for joining us today from the Baptist Bible College in Clark Summit, Pennsylvania.
[time=339] The chamber singers, they have been here at least two other times that I know.
[time=344] And I always say that with tongue in cheek because a college group is never at your church more than once.
[time=350] They turn over every four years, so this is a whole new crop.
[time=354] And they are getting better looking all the time, as you can see, all except for the leader.
[time=360] He's just like all the rest of us getting more mature looking all the time.
[time=365] Why don't you stand up, Don, after I gave that introduction, Don Ellsworth is their leader, and he's been with them every time. We're grateful to have them all here.
[time=373] Let them know we're happy to have them, will you?
[time=375] [audience applause]
[time=382] The chamber singers are on tour, and we're so grateful that they stop to be with us.
[time=387] They believe it or not, they're on their way to the Orient.
[time=390] And you can't get to the Orient unless you go through Fort Wayne, and so they're here to sing for us.
[time=395] We're going to be praying for them in these next crucial days, and for all of us here in the auditorium, we're going to have a chance to share in their ministry with the retiring offering at the end of the service.
[time=404] But right now, listen to the ministry of the chamber singers.
[time=408] [piano music]
[time=430] [singing]
[time=511] [singing] [singing]
[time=541] [singing] We're happy you joined us today. I know you've already enjoyed the music, and we have some more for you in just a few moments.
[time=552] Right now, I want to take a moment to express our appreciation to someone who has become an associate sponsor of the Bible Hour.
[time=560] Associate sponsors are a group of people who support the Bible Hour as it comes to them through the station in their area for $100 on a special Sunday and help to underwrite the cost of the airtime.
[time=573] Our sponsor today is Mr. Claude A. Smith, who watches the Bible Hour on WHME in South Bend, Indiana.
[time=581] Mr. Smith, we're grateful for your help, and we thank you for participating and fellowshipping with us in the preaching of the Word of God on today's program.
[time=589] We want to encourage others of you who are interested in the sponsors program to write and get information from us as to how you can participate in helping us preach the gospel in your area.
[time=600] We appreciate so very much those of you who have helped us in this way.
[time=604] During these days, we're making available to our Bible Hour Friends, a very special little book called 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible.
[time=613] This is a unique presentation for a number of reasons. First of all, it is not just questions listed at random, but questions that are organized as they appear in the scriptures, beginning at the Book of Genesis and going right through to the end of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation.
[time=629] For instance, in the Book of Genesis, as you study the life of Abraham, there are over 62 questions and answers on the life of that great patriarch.
[time=639] So as you're reading through the Bible, you can study not only what the Bible says, but you can find the answers to the questions that come to your mind as you're reading through the scriptures.
[time=649] Now this very helpful booklet is yours absolutely free if you'll just get in touch with us today. There are two ways you can do that and I'd like to explain them.
[time=658] First of all, you can go to your phone and call toll free, 1-800-453-9000.
[time=665] And when the operator answers, just ask for the Bible Hour Office and request your free copy of this booklet.
[time=672] And we will have an opportunity to send it to you this week, a postage paid and free, and it will be our joy to extend the ministry of the Bible Hour into your home through this special gift.
[time=683] Or of course you can write to me if you please, and we always appreciate getting your letters because I get to read them that way and we get to see what's going on in your life and in your heart.
[time=693] If you choose to write, simply write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=703] Once again, the address is post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=710] Special gift to you this week is the booklet, 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible, a very helpful Bible study tool that I know will be a blessing in your life.
[time=720] Now, just a moment, we're going back to the service. We're going to have some more music from the chamber singers.
[time=726] And then I'm going to speak to you on the subject of prayer, the second message in this priority for the church.
[time=732] What happens when men pray? What happens when they don't?
[time=736] I hope you'll have your Bible handy, notebook, pencil, or a pen so you can take some notes and we'll study the scriptures together in just a moment.
[time=750] [MUSIC]
[time=760] In only a moment in the twinkling of our own.
[time=771] At the Sound of the Trumpet, we will see him come.
[time=782] In only a moment we behold him in the sky.
[time=792] At the Lord himself, we kindly take us home.
[time=802] We shall all be changed, but up to heaven in a cloud of glory.
[time=811] We shall all be changed, transformed in victory.
[time=819] Where is thy sweet God conquered at the town?
[time=828] We shall all be changed, we shall all be changed.
[time=840] [MUSIC]
[time=850] In only a moment Jesus Christ will call his own.
[time=863] In the voice of the angel and the Trumpet.
[time=874] In only a moment we'll be raised from earth to heaven.
[time=884] And we'll live in peace forever with the Lord.
[time=894] We shall all be changed, but up to heaven in a cloud of glory.
[time=903] We shall all be changed, transformed in victory.
[time=911] And where is thy sweet God conquered at the town?
[time=920] We shall all be changed, we shall all be changed.
[time=929] We shall all be changed, but up to heaven in a cloud of glory.
[time=938] We shall all be changed, transformed in victory.
[time=946] In heaven where is thy sweet God conquered at the town?
[time=956] We shall all be changed, we shall all be changed.
[time=975] Now just a moment they're going to sing again, but while I have your attention for just a moment
[time=981] I want to remind you that during the months of the summer, June, July and August, we share together in the summer Bible Conference.
[time=988] This is the second year for our Bible Conference that meets every Thursday night for the whole summer.
[time=994] And we have had some exciting sessions already with Dr. Falwell who was here for the first week.
[time=1000] And my father who was here the following week and last week Dr. David Allen from up in the Detroit, Michigan area.
[time=1008] This Thursday night Dr. Truman Dollar from Kansas City will be here.
[time=1012] He was with us last year and we all so appreciated his ministry.
[time=1016] He is the pastor of the Kansas City Baptist Temple.
[time=1019] He is probably the closest friend I have in the ministry as a pastor.
[time=1023] And I know that he'll be a real blessing to you this week.
[time=1027] Now those of you who are watching by television realize that in the area of Fort Wayne, if you receive this locally, this announcement is good.
[time=1034] But if you live someplace else, it's already too late.
[time=1037] And you just rejoice in all the good times we had while I'm making this announcement.
[time=1042] I hope you will pray with me about the airline strike because I'm not sure if he can get here.
[time=1047] And that also impacts a great number of folks who want to come to the GRBC Conference and went on the lake.
[time=1054] So we need to be in prayer about that matter.
[time=1057] And that's even more important than the baseball strike which also has me concerned.
[time=1062] So I would appreciate very much if you would commit this to the Lord in prayer.
[time=1066] Well, we'll listen to the chamber singers again before the message.
[time=1083] What kind of love is this?
[time=1085] I mean, we know love.
[time=1088] We experience love.
[time=1090] Love of a mother.
[time=1092] A father.
[time=1093] A friend.
[time=1095] Love and marriage.
[time=1097] The love of children.
[time=1099] But a love that leads to death.
[time=1102] Will we ever comprehend that quality of love?
[time=1113] In his pity.
[time=1117] He redeemed us.
[time=1122] In his love.
[time=1125] And in his pity.
[time=1129] Before I didn't have.
[time=1135] Never has another love just like the Savior loved.
[time=1148] How can anyone suspect himself upon a cross and die for me?
[time=1164] And I will leave.
[time=1171] To set us free.
[time=1179] But he gave love.
[time=1185] He had guilty on us.
[time=1194] He provided love and marriage.
[time=1201] Shall we not return?
[time=1205] Love gave one.
[time=1207] Leave his name or our dear Savior.
[time=1212] And one day he will return.
[time=1224] Before I was.
[time=1230] Oh, he suffered in the garden.
[time=1238] Oh, you're still in mine.
[time=1244] He didn't judge a guy.
[time=1249] He spotted my will but I.
[time=1257] To sing hums and angry soldiers speak upon that grace.
[time=1269] And the sky in which the darkness grew.
[time=1276] And it's too rich a sin would go.
[time=1285] And Jesus died.
[time=1292] He loved us all.
[time=1300] Yes he did love.
[time=1307] He had guilty on us.
[time=1312] He provided love and marriage.
[time=1323] Shall we not return?
[time=1327] Love gave one.
[time=1329] Leave his name or our dear Savior.
[time=1334] And one day he will return.
[time=1346] [MUSIC]
[time=1371] Thank you young people.
[time=1372] I'm sure you are encouraged when God allows us the privilege of all of these exciting young people who come through to share with us and minister to us so often.
[time=1381] I think it's a tremendous way for us to lift up what can happen in the life of young people who are dedicated to Christ.
[time=1389] I'm excited about the fact that our young people get a chance to get acquainted with them.
[time=1394] Oftentimes when they stay overnight they stay in our homes and we get a chance to rub shoulders with them and see what God is doing in their lives.
[time=1401] We hear so many bad things about young people these days.
[time=1404] I'll tell you we've got some of the greatest young people going in this congregation, and then God sends us a fresh batch every once in a while just to look over and see that it's happening other places too, and that's an encouragement.
[time=1417] We have been studying together in our services during these days the priorities of the church.
[time=1423] We began with the priority of preaching, and we studied Acts 20, and then we talked about the priority of people and the doctrine of fellowship, and then last week we began a three-part study in the priority of prayer.
[time=1440] Today I want to ask you to turn in your Bibles to the Old Testament book of 1 Kings, 1 Kings chapter 18, and I want to read as you follow in your Bibles the 18th chapter of 1 Kings beginning at verse 41 and reading through the 46th verse.
[time=1460] 1 Kings chapter 18, 41 through 46.
[time=1468] I see that 1 Kings is not as easy to find as some of the books we usually study.
[time=1473] Everybody stopped whether they're there or not. 1 Kings chapter 18.
[time=1478] Elijah said unto Ahab, get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain. So Ahab went up to eat and to drink, and Elijah went up to the top of caramel, and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees.
[time=1493] He said to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea," and he went up and looked and said, "There is nothing." And he said, "Go again seven times," and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said, "Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand."
[time=1509] And he said, "Go up, say unto Ahab, prepare thy chariot and get thee down, that the rain stopped thee not." He came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.
[time=1520] And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel, and the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
[time=1530] Now let's pray together. Father in heaven, we are thankful for the opportunity we have to open the Word of God and to study it together.
[time=1538] It is such an encouragement to us. There are so many strong truths for us to learn. We haven't even touched the hem of the garment of God's truth, though we have studied it for many years.
[time=1550] Today as we see this illustration in the Old Testament, we pray that you will make it come alive to us, not only as we understand its meaning, but Lord help it, that it might come alive within us, in our own action, in our own response.
[time=1565] We thank you for what you're going to do in these moments that have been dedicated to the teaching and preaching and feeding of the Word of God. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1577] While walking down the street one day, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the great London preacher, overheard a robust young man swearing something terrible.
[time=1592] He arrested him with this question. Pardon me young man, can you pray as well as you swear?
[time=1601] There was really a profligate and he was very offended at such a spiritual question. He said, "I don't have anything to do with that stuff. I don't take time to pray. It's a waste of time, and I don't ever do that."
[time=1612] Spurgeon reached in his pocket and he pulled out a quarter. He handed it to the young man. He said, "I'll give you this quarter if you promise me never to pray again."
[time=1623] The young man said, "That's a deal." He grabbed the quarter and stuck it in his pocket and walked away. He went home and told his wife about the experience and they began to think about what he had promised, never to pray again.
[time=1637] Suddenly he realized that someday he might need to pray and he'd made a promise to a preacher that he would never pray again.
[time=1644] He put that quarter in his pocket and he took off throughout London trying to find Spurgeon finally when he located him, he gave him the quarter back. He said that was a bad deal and the result of it was that he accepted Christ as a savior and became a Christian and a very sincere prayer warrior.
[time=1660] If I ask you today, would you give up your right to pray for a quarter while you would say, "Pastor, nobody in their right mind would ever do that?"
[time=1670] But some of you have done it for nothing. Some of you have given up your right to pray absolutely without charge and without cost. You don't pray at all.
[time=1682] You are suffering from the sin of prayerlessness. And it is a sin for the Scripture says that when we cease to pray for one another, we sin.
[time=1694] Someone whose writings I read several months ago said that prayer is a sin for at least five reasons. It is a sin against the person of God, for he is the holy God who has instructed us to pray.
[time=1709] And when we refuse his instruction, we violate his holy nature.
[time=1714] It is a sin against the purposes and plan of God, for God has so ordained that he will operate his sovereign economy through the means of prayer.
[time=1724] And when we refuse to pray, we just cut right across the grain of God's purpose and plan.
[time=1731] When we do not pray, it is a sin against the pleasure of God, for he has instructed us that he desires our fellowship.
[time=1738] It is his pleasure that we pray. It is what he wants us to do. It is the will of God for us to pray.
[time=1745] And when we refuse, we sin against the pleasure of God. Prayerlessness is also a sin against the promises of God.
[time=1753] For in the book we are told that if we pray, certain things will happen. When we refuse to pray, we violate the covenant that we have made with God and we end up without any of the benefits God would have to give us.
[time=1766] Finally, when we refuse to pray, we sin against the power of God.
[time=1771] And we end up instead of knowing the power that comes from God in heaven, substituting our own cheap imitation of cleverness and astuteness and intellect and machinery.
[time=1788] When we do not pray, we sin against God. It is true. We have not because we ask not.
[time=1797] The reason we do not have what God wants us to have is not because it is not available to us.
[time=1802] The reason we do not pray is because we do not know how to pray.
[time=1807] We do not pray because it violates the very human nature, which is still very much with us.
[time=1814] And the result is we do not have what God would have for us. We have not because we ask not.
[time=1821] Yet it is interesting to me as I study the Scripture to discover that prayer is the warfare and the weapon of the Christian. Did you know that?
[time=1830] Last week we talked about prayer as worship and as work, but the Bible also speaks of prayer as warfare.
[time=1837] In the book of 2 Corinthians, that letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthian Church in the 10th chapter in verses 4 and 5, Paul writes these words.
[time=1846] "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal or fleshly or humanistic, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and everything that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,
[time=1864] and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." Paul said, "The weapons that we use in our spiritual warfare are not the human things that we learn how to do.
[time=1876] We do not get these weapons by going to seminary or to college or even attending classes in a church.
[time=1882] You cannot learn humanly how to deal in the spiritual realm.
[time=1886] Our weapons," said Paul, "are mighty through God their spiritual weapons that he has put into our hands to do his work and to war his warfare in our world."
[time=1897] Now those weapons are listed for us in the 5th chapter of Ephesians and you know that passage to put on the whole armor of God.
[time=1904] Quite often when we teach that section of Scripture, we go through all of the weapons and we leave out the most important part.
[time=1911] For Ephesians 5, 18, which comes at the very end of that chapter says, "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints."
[time=1927] Someone has described that as the doctrine of all prayer.
[time=1930] And if you read the text and underline in your mind what I emphasize when I read it this time, you will understand what I mean.
[time=1937] "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints."
[time=1950] It is as if Paul has taken the armor which he has broken down piece by piece and having instructed us with the armor that we are to wear.
[time=1960] Now he says, "Above all and most important of all, don't try to wear the armor and do battle without prayer for it is the all encompassing equipment that God has given you to do battle in the world today."
[time=1974] Prayer is the weapon that God has put into our hands to do battle for him.
[time=1982] You say, "Pastor, did ever anyone so pray?"
[time=1989] I wouldn't want to answer that question beyond the spot nor would most of you.
[time=1995] But you know the Bible is so very careful not to give us instruction without illustration.
[time=2001] Wherever there is a principle that God has enjoined upon us, there will always be a godly example that will take the abstract truth and put it into flesh and blood so that we can see it live as we watch it play out on the platform and on the stage.
[time=2016] One such illustration of a man of prayer was the man Elijah.
[time=2021] We don't really know as much about his prayer life as we ought to until we have read through the Old Testament and almost all of the New Testament we come at last to the book of James in the 5th chapter.
[time=2031] And there we read this about the man Elijah in James 5, 17 and 18.
[time=2036] Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are.
[time=2042] And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
[time=2051] And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit.
[time=2057] Now listen to what James is saying.
[time=2059] He's saying Elijah was just like you, just like me.
[time=2064] Not one of the paper saints that we paint up in our Sunday school quarterlies that don't seem to ever be real to us.
[time=2070] And Elijah was exactly like you are, exactly like I am.
[time=2074] And yet Elijah was a prayer warrior and his warfare in prayer was so strong that one time he prayed that it wouldn't rain and it didn't rain one drop for three years and six months.
[time=2087] At the end of that time he prayed again, "Lord let it rain and it rain." Whether that's power in prayer. And it's interesting to go back having read what James says about Elijah and examine the details of what really happened.
[time=2103] Now in the 18th chapter of the book of Kings we have that story.
[time=2108] Elijah as most of you know was the key figure on the Mount Carmel revival team.
[time=2114] God used him in a magnificent way to bring revival to Israel as you study the history of Israel up until the point of Elijah's preeminence on Mount Carmel.
[time=2124] It is like reading today's newspapers. I read through it again this week and you read about this king and he's bad, but the next king's worse than he was.
[time=2133] And then the one after him is worse than the two went before him.
[time=2136] When you get to King Ahab who was reigning when Elijah came on the scene the scripture says Ahab was worse than all of the kings who went before him.
[time=2145] He was the epitome of evil.
[time=2148] And into that situation God brought Elijah as his prophet, as his minister, as his revival leader.
[time=2156] And you know the story of Mount Carmel, it's one of the most exciting stories in the Old Testament.
[time=2160] Elijah's up on the mountain and the prophets of Baal are on the mountain and they're having this big contest to see who's really God.
[time=2166] And Elijah's going through all of the incantations of sarcasm and using the sharp tongue that the prophet had and he's making fun of the prophets of Baal.
[time=2175] And the story is very, very clear and very colorful. Elijah's team wins. The Baalites lose.
[time=2182] Not only did their sacrifice not get consumed, but the prophets of Baal, 400 of them were slain in a red blood and massacre that wiped out all of the preachers of the Baalite religion.
[time=2194] Now Elijah had a great day. He had one of the most fantastic revivals that's ever been recorded.
[time=2200] And the interesting thing is that it is right after that that the great temptation comes.
[time=2206] It would have been easy for Elijah to stay around the base of Mount Carmel to get the handshakes of all the people.
[time=2212] Great job, Elijah. Boy, that was a tremendous thing you did.
[time=2216] But when we find Elijah next, we see him illustrating and demonstrating a truth that the believer is always the most vulnerable to defeat after a great victory has been wrought in his life.
[time=2229] Isn't that true with you?
[time=2231] That great moment, that mountaintop experience that Elijah had that day put him in the place of greatest jeopardy.
[time=2243] But Elijah countered the warfare of Satan with his own weaponry, which was prayer.
[time=2250] Now we pick up the story in the 41st verse.
[time=2254] Elijah, having finished his mountaintop revival, says to Ahab, "Get the up, eat and drink, for there's a sound of abundance of rain."
[time=2262] And Ahab went up to eat and drink, and Elijah went to the top of Carmel, cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees.
[time=2271] As we examine this experience in First Kings, it's interesting to just pull out the salient things about Elijah's prayer and just kind of write him down on the table of our hearts and realize that God has something to say to us as we examine this man.
[time=2283] The first thing we notice about Elijah is that he had the proper perspective on his prayer.
[time=2289] Here we have two men, Ahab and Elijah, both of them in the same experience.
[time=2298] What does Ahab doing?
[time=2300] Well, he's going on a picnic, eat and drink.
[time=2305] Of course, Elijah suggested it, but what else do you tell somebody who isn't a Christian?
[time=2309] What else do you tell somebody who isn't a man of God?
[time=2312] What else do you give them to do?
[time=2314] They don't understand the spiritual weaponry, so the best that Ahab could do was to take care of his physical needs, but Elijah knew there was a need that was greater than that, and that was his own spiritual need.
[time=2325] We don't see Elijah at the picnic, he goes up a little higher, and he's on the mountaintop talking to God.
[time=2332] I've discovered in my own life that it seems like it is at this point more than any other place that the battle rages.
[time=2338] It's between the physical and the spiritual, isn't it?
[time=2341] This whole matter of prayer comes down to that real struggle in one's life.
[time=2345] Why don't we pray?
[time=2347] Can't get out of bed in the morning.
[time=2349] The old body won't cooperate.
[time=2352] Why don't we spend more time in prayer?
[time=2354] Because there are so many things we need to be doing, so many works that need to be done, and it seems like such a waste of time to be secluded in that closet on our knees, talking to a God we cannot see when the world is waiting for us to come.
[time=2367] The world is waiting for us to work the works of God.
[time=2372] What you see, Elijah had the right perspective on prayer.
[time=2377] He knew that the spiritual exercise of prayer was the preparation for the real challenge God had before him, and so he exercised himself in prayer.
[time=2391] There was just three years and six months before that that Elijah had been having his devotions out in the desert in some secluded spot, reading from the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy.
[time=2402] And as he read from the Old Testament scriptures that day, he read the words that God had recorded through Moses, that if his people, the people of Israel, ever turned from worshiping the true God, that God in heaven would send a drought upon the land to punish them for their sin.
[time=2419] And Elijah was out there praying, having his devotions, and he read that from the book of Deuteronomy, and he said, "Oh God, that's what you promised, but it hasn't happened."
[time=2428] And he got up off of his knees and he marched out of the desert, dressed in the most unusual garb you ever saw, walked right into the palace of King Ahab, stood before him, and he said, "King, it's not going to rain for three years because of the sin of this people."
[time=2443] Boy, where did he get the power and the courage to do that? Got it on his knees before God, and that's what it says right in the book of James.
[time=2451] He prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not.
[time=2459] Andrew Murray, who has written so extensively on the subject of prayer, has this comment to make.
[time=2465] He said, "As long as we look on prayer chiefly as the means of maintaining our own Christian life, we shall never know fully what it is meant to be."
[time=2474] Now listen, "But when we learn to regard prayer as the highest part of the work that has been entrusted to us, we shall see that there is nothing that we need to study and to practice as much as we need to study and practice the art of praying right."
[time=2493] Elijah teaches us that the spiritual is more important than the physical.
[time=2498] It's more important that you pray than that you feed your face.
[time=2502] I remember a fellow that I ran into when I was a college student in Cedarville who had a little rule that he used on himself, and it went like this.
[time=2509] No Bible, no breakfast.
[time=2513] Some of you would lose weight like crazy.
[time=2516] It might be the best thing you could ever do for your physical being, no Bible, no breakfast.
[time=2522] Putting the spiritual on a plane above the physical.
[time=2526] If we'd ever do that, folks, we'd see some great things happen in the Church of God.
[time=2530] Lesson number one, he had the right perspective on prayer.
[time=2533] Now notice, secondly, he knew the proper place for prayer.
[time=2537] It says in verse 42 that he went up to the top of Mount Carmel, and there cast himself down on the earth.
[time=2546] He only took one man with him, and that was his servant.
[time=2548] He secluded himself from the din of the activity of that day, taking only a servant, and the only reason he took his servant was he needed an errand boy to check on God.
[time=2556] That's the only reason.
[time=2558] He needed somebody to go and check as to see whether God was doing his work or not, so he took his servant with him.
[time=2563] But he got away from everything so he could concentrate his heart and his mind in the practice of prayer.
[time=2572] I don't know about you, but I can't pray in my household unless I can go someplace and shut the door on all the activity.
[time=2581] Our house is like Grand Central Station.
[time=2584] Somebody's always going and coming and usually very loudly.
[time=2588] And to try to pray in the living room with all of that going on there, it's impossible.
[time=2594] Somehow, if you're going to really pray, you've got to get away.
[time=2597] You've got to get alone so you can concentrate on your relationship with God.
[time=2601] Now folks, there's praying, and then there's praying.
[time=2604] I belong to a group of joggers who pray when they jog, and that's all right.
[time=2611] That's a kind of praying.
[time=2612] In fact, if you jog around here, you better pray if you jog on the streets like I do.
[time=2617] But that's not really praying.
[time=2620] You can talk to God about the things that are on your heart.
[time=2623] Sometimes I run with another fellow and we pray, even pray out loud sort of breathlessly, but we get it done.
[time=2629] But that's not what I'm talking about.
[time=2631] I'm talking about the kind of prayer where you get away from everyone in a secluded place alone with God so that you can concentrate your attention on the God to whom you speak.
[time=2644] In that same chapter of the book of James, James writes this.
[time=2647] He says, "The effectual, fervent, prayer of a righteous man of valeth much."
[time=2653] And then he uses the illustration of Elijah, "Men and women, what is effectual, fervent prayer?"
[time=2659] It is not the glib, "Hello God, how are you this morning?" I've got a few things to tell you about, kind of prayer.
[time=2665] It is the kind of prayer where we pour all of our soul and our mind fervently, effectually, into talking to God.
[time=2672] And if you've ever done it, you know what I'm talking about.
[time=2675] You know the difference between that and the surface kind of praying that all of us use so often to soothe our guilty consciences.
[time=2683] Elijah went to a place alone, there he prayed.
[time=2687] You know there's something about, do you ever pray in a mountain top?
[time=2690] Somebody says, "If you see big things, you think big thoughts." So probably not too good for you to pray on the top of a mountain, but there's something glorious about it.
[time=2698] Nothing between you and God, just to lift up your heart and to pray.
[time=2705] Then Elijah had the right position in prayer.
[time=2708] I find it very interesting to view Elijah on Mount Carmel and then view him in this setting.
[time=2714] Now watch this.
[time=2716] Here he is up on Mount Carmel and all the prophets of Baal are gathered around and they're contesting for the supremacy of deity.
[time=2725] And the prophets of Baal are extolling the virtue of their God.
[time=2729] And Ahab is over on the side cheering them on.
[time=2733] And Elijah is up on the top of the mountain.
[time=2735] He's already told the people of Israel, "Choose you this day whom you will serve." And I'm going to show you who you should serve.
[time=2741] And he stands tall and straight in front of all of those wicked prophets.
[time=2745] And he challenges them.
[time=2746] If you read the first part of this chapter, you'll discover that he not only challenged them, he made fun of them.
[time=2752] He sarcastically spoke of them.
[time=2755] He said, "What's the matter with your God? Maybe he's on vacation.
[time=2758] Maybe he took a little tour and it's really interesting reading." He stands up big, strong and tall to challenge the enemy.
[time=2766] But now the victory is won and we see him on his knees before God.
[time=2772] Because you see, Elijah realized that no man ever stands so tall as the man who is on his knees before his maker.
[time=2781] Because that in the sight of God, he was nothing.
[time=2786] He resisted the urge that must have been within him to take the credit for what God had done.
[time=2794] That's one of the reasons why we are so vulnerable after a great victory.
[time=2798] Somehow, after the battle is over and the victory is won, we forget who won the victory for us.
[time=2805] And we stay around afterward to shake hands.
[time=2808] That was pretty good, wasn't it?
[time=2811] I heard a story this week about a woodpecker that was working on a tree.
[time=2816] Just working his heart out, trying to make a dent in that tree.
[time=2820] And while he was working on the tree, a storm came up and lightning flashed.
[time=2825] And it just so happened that lightning struck the tree right at the point where he was working.
[time=2830] Split it right down the middle.
[time=2834] He flew away and about a half hour later, he came back with ten of his buddies.
[time=2838] He said, "There it is, fellas. That's what I did." How many of us are like that?
[time=2844] Isn't that the way God does something great for us?
[time=2846] And we come back, "There it is. That's what I did." Elijah realized the tremendous temptation that would be his to assume to himself God's glory.
[time=2856] And we see him now on his knees, praying, "Oh God." I was sharing with the early service this morning that sometimes I wonder if we wouldn't be better if we would change the way we do things in the service.
[time=2867] Usually we have prayer meetings back here before the service starts.
[time=2871] I wonder if after the service is over and if God has ministered to the hearts of people and there have been decisions made,
[time=2877] if all of us wouldn't do well just to get on our knees and say, "Now God, you've worked today in our service. Thank you for it."
[time=2884] To you alone goes the credit. We give you the glory and the honor. Don't let us usurp any that belongs to you.
[time=2892] He had the right position in prayer.
[time=2896] I want you to notice in verse 43 that he claimed God's promise in prayer.
[time=2903] You know, it's really interesting that he goes up on the mountain and he prays and then he tells the servant to go check out God's answer.
[time=2913] You say, "Well, how did he know God was going to answer?" Well, you find that over in the first verse of chapter 18 and you don't want to overlook it because it's the key to his whole prayer life.
[time=2922] Chapter 18 verse 1 we read and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying,
[time=2931] "Go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the earth."
[time=2937] Now, all Elijah is doing up there on his knees with his head bowed down is saying, "Lord, you promised you said it was going to rain.
[time=2946] Now, Lord, I'm claiming today the promise that you made concerning rain." The servant go check and see if it's come yet.
[time=2955] And he comes back down the mountain and says, "Nothing hasn't happened yet." So Elijah prays again. He says, "Now, Lord, don't forget you said it was going to rain." Go check it out again.
[time=2967] You know, it's a great way to pray.
[time=2969] Have you ever prayed that way, pleading the promises of God?
[time=2973] Have you ever done that?
[time=2975] It's a great thing to do.
[time=2977] You find that it's great for you and it works.
[time=2980] Lord, you promised that if I cast all my care on you, you'll care for me.
[time=2986] Now, that's what you promised, Lord.
[time=2989] You promised that if I would commit my way unto you and not lean on my own understanding, you would direct my paths.
[time=2997] Now, Lord, I'm counting on that promise. You promised.
[time=3002] You don't ever have to worry about God answering such a prayer because if He promised it, He will do it.
[time=3008] And you're always praying in the will of God when you pray the promises of God that belong to you back to the Father.
[time=3016] The key to Elijah's prayer was he'd already found out what God's will was and he was just telling God it was time.
[time=3023] That's what it means in the Bible, folks, when it says, "If we ask anything according to the will of God, He will do it.
[time=3028] If we find a promise in the Word of God, and then we pray that promise back to God, we can expect the answer from God."
[time=3036] Do you see it?
[time=3038] It's great to pray God's promises back because you always know you're on good praying ground.
[time=3044] Now, notice, fifthly, that in Elijah's prayer, as he wore it as God's warrior in prayer, he continued persistently in prayer.
[time=3058] I find it very interesting that God has given to us this illustration of a man who prayed for the same thing seven times in a row,
[time=3065] and it wasn't until the seventh time that he got what he wanted, even though God had already promised it to him.
[time=3071] Most of us, after the first time with the promise of God in our hand, would say, "Well, I don't know what's going on here,
[time=3077] but this doesn't make any sense." I prayed God teaches us in His Word the doctrine of importunity, which means persistence in our prayer.
[time=3087] Seven times he sent that servant up the mountain to see what was going on, and six times he came back empty-handed.
[time=3095] And Elijah just kept right on praying.
[time=3098] I read this week a statement written by Spurgeon concerning this particular story.
[time=3108] And I find it interesting to listen to his insight into what God is doing with the seven prayers.
[time=3114] He said, "Success is certain when the Lord has promised it." You can be sure of that.
[time=3120] Although you might have pleaded month after month without any evidence of answer, it is not possible that the Lord should be deaf when he has promised and you pray in earnestness.
[time=3132] The prophet on the top of Carmel continued to wrestle with God, and never for a moment gave way to fear that God was going to forget him.
[time=3140] Six times the servant returned, but on each occasion no word was spoken, but go again.
[time=3147] We must not dream of unbelief, but we must hold to our faith even to seventy times seven.
[time=3155] Faith sends expected hope to look from Carmel's brow, and if nothing is beheld, she sends again and again and again.
[time=3164] That's the kind of prayer God teaches us to practice persistent prayer.
[time=3171] We live in such an instant society. Everything's got to happen right now.
[time=3176] God asked once, "Where are you?" I told you about this need. When are you going to get it done?
[time=3184] One of the things that Spurgeon says happens to us when we pray again and again is this.
[time=3190] We are humbled. We are abashed. Our groans become deeper.
[time=3196] Our sighings more vehement. We become more agreeable to flesh and blood to have a speedy answer,
[time=3203] but find that we are moving now away from the physical into the spiritual realm, and we discover that delayed answers often set our hearts searching itself and lead us to contrition and spiritual reformation.
[time=3217] I don't know what Elijah was doing between the trips up the mountain, but I imagine it went something like this.
[time=3222] Lord, you promised, and I prayed, "Oh God, search my heart.
[time=3227] Help me to see if there be some wicked way in me that would cloud the answer from coming."
[time=3233] Up went the servant again, and down he came again, and all this time Elijah is wrestling within himself
[time=3239] so that God might answer his prayer.
[time=3242] You see, James said, "The effectual fervent prayer of what kind of man?
[time=3248] A righteous man, a veil of much." And many times when God delays the answer six, seven times, it is noted that we might re-examine our own hearts
[time=3259] to see if we're the kind of vessel into which he can pour his holy answer to our prayer.
[time=3266] He was persistent.
[time=3271] The thing I like about this prayer was that he prayed and he got energized.
[time=3277] He had power as the result of it.
[time=3279] And I know it's in the physical realm, and I don't want to make more out of this than I should, but the Scripture says when he got done praying, he said, "Go up until Ahab to get in his chariot, and he better drive like J. Hugh because it's going to rain." And when it rains, the mud's going to come, and the chariot wheels are going to be just like the chariot wheels in the Jordan River.
[time=3296] You better get going Ahab because the rain's coming and get back to Jezreel before it overtakes you.
[time=3302] Now, I want you to notice what happens.
[time=3304] In the 18th chapter, it says in verse 46, that the hand of the Lord was on Elijah.
[time=3310] He girded up his loins, and he ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel ten to twelve miles away.
[time=3319] He outran a horse and chariot.
[time=3324] It wasn't a ten thousand meter race.
[time=3327] It was a ten mile race, and Elijah established a new Jewish record that day.
[time=3337] I have to imagine Ahab driving that chariot, and it's going lickety split, and he looks over, and here's Elijah chugging along beside him, and he's not losing him.
[time=3345] Well, surely he won't go much more than a mile, and two miles, and three miles, and four miles.
[time=3350] Finally, Elijah says, "See Ahab," and off he goes, and when Ahab gets to Jezreel,
[time=3357] Elijah's sitting on a rock outside the gate saying, "Where have you been?"
[time=3364] He said, "Pastor, how did that happen?" Well, verse 46 says, "The hand of the Lord was on Elijah."
[time=3373] Folks, how do you get the hand of the Lord on you?
[time=3376] You have to bend down low enough so he can reach you.
[time=3379] You see?
[time=3380] You've got to get on your knees.
[time=3382] God will reach his hand down and put it on you.
[time=3386] And it won't always be in the physical realm that you will respond.
[time=3391] Most often, it's in the spiritual realm, but prayer is the key.
[time=3397] You see it?
[time=3399] Prayer is the key.
[time=3402] Let us pray.
[time=3405] God in heaven, thank you for this great truth.
[time=3409] How we love Elijah, we don't want to forget that even after this great victory through
[time=3415] prayer, the next time we see him, he has discouragedly fallen back into the ways of the flesh,
[time=3422] running away this time from a woman who he fears.
[time=3426] We are so like him.
[time=3428] We have our great moments, our great mountaintop experiences.
[time=3433] And then sometimes, if we're not careful, we forget.
[time=3438] Lord, help us to remember that the only way God can ever work through us, his work, is
[time=3446] when we open our lives to him through prayer.
