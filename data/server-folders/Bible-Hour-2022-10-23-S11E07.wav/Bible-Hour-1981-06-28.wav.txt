[time=25] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jaramond.
[time=35] Then since my soul, my Savior after me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=51] I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=74] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=80] We're happy to have you here today.
[time=82] We thank you for being a part of our congregation.
[time=84] Those of you who have gathered here in the auditorium, we welcome you to the second worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=92] We see some visitors who are here during this summer season and we're grateful to have you with us as well.
[time=97] Then as always, it is our privilege to open wide the doors of this church and share this particular service with our friends at home by means of television.
[time=106] We greet you and thank you for sharing this time with us.
[time=109] We trust it will be a blessing in your life and an encouragement to you throughout the entirety of this hour.
[time=115] Our special guests today are the Proclamation Singers from the Grand Rapids Baptist College and Seminary and we'll be hearing from them in a few moments, but right now let's listen to our choir.
[time=125] They're under the leadership of Pastor Don Kruger and they're singing a beautiful song written by Andr√© Crouch entitled My Tribute.
[time=150] Oh, can I say thanks for the things you have done for me, being so undeserved as you be
[time=169] and I will be the first to be the first to be the first to be the first to be the first to be.
[time=192] I know to be, to run me a glory, to run me a glory, to run me a glory, for the things
[time=217] we have done before we have saved me with this glory and praise me, to run me a glory,
[time=239] to be the first to be the first to be the first to be the first to be the first to be the
[time=304] That is one of the most beautiful gospel songs in my estimation that has been written
[time=322] in recent years and grateful for the ministry of our choir.
[time=327] The proclamation is a group of young people that are traveling the United States during the summer months, representing first of all the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=335] Secondly, they're representing a very fine college and seminary that is approved by the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches in Grand Rapids.
[time=345] It's the Grand Rapids Baptist College in Seminary.
[time=348] Dr. Wilbert Welch is the president of those schools, and we're grateful to have these young people with us today.
[time=354] For those of you who are here in our service, there's a very fine display table in the foyer that has information about this college and the seminary, and if you're interested in Christian education and the college level, I hope you will take time today to stop by
[time=370] that table and pick up some literature that will help you become acquainted with the ministry.
[time=375] Right now we're excited to listen to these young people as they sing for us, so proclamation welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and God bless you as you minister to us.
[time=394] When you're up against the struggle of all that shatters are your dreams, and your hopes
[time=416] have a cruelly crush by Satan's manifesting schemes, and if you leave years within you,
[time=429] don't use a gift to earth the ears, don't let the fingers stand in it, seems to disappear,
[time=438] praise him, praise the Lord, for our God inhabits praise, praise the Lord, for the chains that
[time=448] seem to bind you, serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you, when
[time=456] you pray to you, now Satan is a liar, and he wants to make us think that we are followers,
[time=468] when he knows himself we're children of the King, so lift up the mighty shield of faith
[time=476] for the battle must be won, we know that Jesus Christ is risen, so the words already done
[time=484] praise the Lord, He can work through those who praise him, praise the Lord, for our God
[time=494] inhabits praise, praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you, serve only to
[time=503] remind you that they drop powerless behind you, when you pray to you, praise the Lord,
[time=520] for our God inhabits praise, praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you, serve
[time=532] only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you, when you pray to you, praise
[time=544] when you pray to you, praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you, praise
[time=574] each week at this time on the Bible hour, Don and I have the opportunity to talk with
[time=584] you very personally about the ministry that comes into your home each week, today we have a number of very important things we need to discuss with you, but before we get into those things, let me remind you that our gift offer to you this month is a very special book called 4,000 Questions and Answers on the Bible, this helpful Bible study tool will
[time=604] assist you as you read through the scriptures and study it on your own, it is equipped with
[time=610] an index and many helpful tools at the end of the book, the main part of the book has to do with questions that follow through consecutively on all of the chapters in the Bible and you will find this very helpful in answering your questions as you study the Word of God, we'd be happy to send it to you absolutely free as our gift to you this month if you will just write to us at post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana or call us
[time=635] on our toll free number 1-800-453-9000, when you call that number ask for your free copy
[time=642] of this book and it will be mailed out to you as soon as we receive your request, now we also have some associate sponsors who are helping us with today's telecast and Donna and you have those folks in their names.
[time=655] We have two associate sponsors today and an associate sponsor are people who have given a special gift designated to cover the air time on the channel where they view the Bible hour and these folks are very special to us and we certainly appreciate their support of the Bible hour.
[time=672] Our associate sponsors today are Mr. and Mrs. Paul Matthews who view on WPTA and Fort
[time=678] Wayne Indiana and also Imogene Johnson has given a gift in memory of Elri Myers and she
[time=686] also views it on WPTA here in Fort Wayne and we thank these folks very much for their support of the ministry.
[time=694] Donna you know that we have been going through some very interesting times in our life and most of the people who watch our television program or many of them already know what
[time=704] I'm going to say to them but I want to make sure that all of the people who are part of our television ministry know from the two of us what God has been doing in our lives.
[time=714] Just a few weeks ago at the end of a morning service I resigned as the pastor of the Black
[time=720] Hawk Baptist Church to assume a new assignment from God as the pastor of the Scott Memorial Church in San Diego, California.
[time=728] So in just a few weeks we'll be saying our final goodbye to our friends here and to all of you who have participated in this television ministry.
[time=737] These have been very traumatic days for us they've been very difficult for the people of our church and yet through it all we have come to realize the sovereignty of God in
[time=747] His hand upon our lives and His absolute certain hand upon this church and its ministries.
[time=753] Many have asked what will happen to the Bible Hour television program.
[time=757] I just want to say with an emphatic tone in my voice that the Bible Hour Television Ministry is here to stay.
[time=764] It's not going to go off the air it will not stop you will continue to receive Bible messages
[time=770] and good heartwarming music of the Christian faith right in the same way that you have
[time=777] all of these weeks and years that we have been on.
[time=780] I don't know the answers to all of the questions as to who the speaker will be or how the format will be but I do want you to know that we at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and Donna and
[time=791] I as a couple in Christian service are deeply committed to the continuity of this ministry
[time=798] and we know that God is going to direct those who have the decisions to make in the future so that they make decisions that will honor Him.
[time=806] I just want to ask you to pray with us during these days that God will give us direction that He will watch over us in a very positive way and that He will give wisdom to this church so that they will know what they ought to do during this time and then I'd like to say to you too that as never before we need your help during this time.
[time=827] There have many of you who have watched the Bible our ministry for years and you have never written one time to say thank you or to express your appreciation for this ministry.
[time=836] I have run into young couples who tell me that their parents watch the Bible our ministry
[time=842] all of the time until finally they went home to be with the Lord.
[time=847] We are mounting a very special financial drive for the future of the Bible our ministry
[time=853] and I would hope that many of you who have never responded will take this opportunity
[time=859] not only to say thank you for what the Bible our has meant in your life up to this point but to put in your financial vote for the future of the Bible our ministry and to say by your sacrificial gift, Pastor Jeremiah, we're committed to the future of the Bible
[time=874] our we want you to know that and we express that in this tangible way.
[time=879] I've never asked for money on the air at least not very often.
[time=882] I believe that the air time belongs to the preaching of the Word of God and the singing of the hymns of the faith and the blessing in your life but I am taking this opportunity in these last few telecasts to ask you specifically to do something special financially for the
[time=898] Bible our ministry and just a few days many of you will be receiving a letter from me asking
[time=904] you and writing to do what I'm asking you to do today in person.
[time=908] I hope you'll respond.
[time=910] God will honor your gift and I promise you that it will be used for the furtherance of the preaching of God's Word through this ministry.
[time=917] There are many many fine people in leadership here who will carry this work on and it will become greater than it ever has in the past but it won't happen if you don't give and
[time=928] I hope you'll do it today all you can do for the Bible our ministry during these days.
[time=933] Thank you and God bless you and I trust the remaining portion of this service will be a blessing to you as well.
[time=958] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=1107] Thank you young people we're going to hear from them again in just a moment but I want to share with all of our friends here as well as those who are watching by television that we have been in the midst of our summer Bible conference and have had some wonderful times together on Thursday evenings with Dr. Jerry Falwell and Truman Dollar and my father and
[time=1126] David Allen this week here at the Thursday conference we'll be hearing from Pastor Jerry
[time=1132] Thorpe from Odessa, Texas and those of you who are in this area we invite you to come and share in that conference.
[time=1138] On July 30th, the very last summer Bible conference night before Dr. Ken Nichols begins
[time=1144] his August series we will be sharing together a very special multimedia musical presentation
[time=1152] by the Liberty Baptist College Singers entitled "Look Up America" it is a sequel to a presentation
[time=1159] that we saw at last year's panorama rather than decrying the problems of our country a very upbeat positive thing that says this is what America is and we should be excited and proud to be a part of it.
[time=1172] It will be a wonderful one-two punch to follow our patriotic panorama next Sunday night just
[time=1178] a few weeks later with this patriotic presentation.
[time=1182] We will have a great crowd that night and we just want to let you know about it so you can make plans to be with us July the 30th that's Thursday evening for Look Up America with the Liberty Baptist College Singers.
[time=1194] Now just before the message we're going to hear again from proclamation.
[time=1224] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=1339] Thank you proclamation for being with us today and sharing in this service and our prayers
[time=1348] are with you as you travel the rest of the summer all over the United States singing and bringing blessing to the hearts of people.
[time=1356] Now I suppose I ought to make an announcement something like this at this point in time.
[time=1361] We interrupt this series to bring you this special message because that's exactly what
[time=1367] I'm going to do.
[time=1368] I'm going to interrupt the series on the priorities of the church to bring a special message.
[time=1373] Whenever I say something like that I always see attention pick up ears sort of twitch a
[time=1379] little bit and everyone sits on the edge of their chair I wonder what's going to happen this morning.
[time=1384] Well I want you to turn in your Bibles to the second book of Corinthians and the eighth chapter and I want you to have your Bibles open and ready at that section of scripture.
[time=1394] We are not going to read it now but we shall read it in a few moments.
[time=1403] Second Corinthians chapter eight.
[time=1409] Now before we begin let us pray together shall we let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1415] Our father we ask that you will take the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts and allow them to be acceptable in thy sight.
[time=1426] We ask that the thoughts that we share today by way of a pastoral discussion with the congregation
[time=1432] and friends will be received in the same sense of earnestness and sincerity in which it
[time=1439] is given.
[time=1442] Lord these are very eventful days for us all and it behooves us to be extremely sensitive
[time=1448] to the ministry of the Spirit of God as he would direct our thoughts and speak to our hearts.
[time=1455] We are so grateful for the attendant power of the Spirit of God who can take even a message
[time=1462] directed to one segment of God's body the church and allow it to bring conviction to
[time=1469] the hearts of those who do not know Christ and bring them to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus.
[time=1475] We saw evidence of that in the first service.
[time=1478] We pray to that end this morning too.
[time=1480] Lord I just ask that you will guard my words that I might speak clearly those things which have been laid upon my heart in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1493] One month ago today at the end of a morning service I made an announcement that was without
[time=1501] question the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life.
[time=1504] When I announced that God was leading Donna, myself and our family to a new ministry on
[time=1512] the West Coast, it has been very interesting to watch what has happened from that moment
[time=1518] until this.
[time=1521] Most of the turmoil which we went through in preparation for that announcement then became
[time=1527] the joy and privilege of all of those who heard that announcement on Sunday and so it's
[time=1533] been interesting to watch people move through many stages of response to that.
[time=1538] Though there may be some and surely there are some, I am grateful to God that no one yet has come up with glee and joy, shaking my hand, rejoicing that finally I'm leaving.
[time=1549] But I appreciate so much the maturity with which this congregation has handled that announcement.
[time=1556] I have said to other pastors as I have been questioned about this, never in all my ministry
[time=1562] here have I been so proud of a group of men as I am of the men on our board of deacons
[time=1569] and the people in this congregation who have taken this challenge and accepted it from God and realized that God has a plan for me that includes a change in plans for them
[time=1580] and together they have molded into a unit to steer this ship through the rough waters of a transition.
[time=1587] I have been spending a great deal of time in these past weeks reminiscing now they tell
[time=1593] me that when you reminisce it's a sign of old age and so maybe my temperament is catching up with my hair I don't know but I have been looking back over these past days thinking
[time=1604] about some of the things that God has done for us and is doing through us now.
[time=1610] It is hard for me to believe that a congregation that on Easter Sunday just a few weeks ago total 1785 actually began just a few 12 years ago with 35 in the morning service.
[time=1624] That is an astounding thing when you stop to look at it and it is certainly a testimony to the power of God for it is beyond any human endeavor.
[time=1632] Probably as startling as the numerical figure are the financial figures.
[time=1638] I can't help but think about that first year when this church started and how we as a group of seven families trusted God together for an annual budget of $30,000.
[time=1649] As I came here to this church my salary as a beginning pastor was $8,500 and so I was very interested in that budget being met believe me.
[time=1659] But you know as well as I do that God met that budget and continued to meet every budget that was proposed to do his work and out of that little $30,000 first year budget has
[time=1670] grown what has happened in the past year at $1.6 million operating budget for all the
[time=1676] ministries of this church.
[time=1680] It is not a normal ministry this Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1684] God has in a wonderful way reached out and signally blessed it and I'm sure most of you feel as I do that it has not been because of us but in a great measure it has been in spite of us and so we give him the glory and the praise and the honor and we thank him as I have many times just for the privilege of being along for the ride.
[time=1704] I think our major responsibility in many of these movements has been to do our very best to stay out of the way so we don't foul up what God wants to do and that has been a joy
[time=1714] to see him work and move upon the hearts of men and women and families in this congregation.
[time=1720] We have devised over the years many new ways along with the church of reaching the people of this community.
[time=1727] Back in 1973 we began a Christian school with 35 students in grades pre-K through 4.
[time=1734] That Christian school has now grown until this year I am told we can expect 350 students
[time=1740] through the 12 grades and most of you who are part of this congregation sat in this auditorium
[time=1746] just a few weeks ago and watched as our proud seniors walked across the stage and we presented
[time=1752] our first graduating class with their diplomas.
[time=1755] That was a proud and exciting night in all of our lives.
[time=1760] Shortly after the Christian school began God gave us an opportunity to start a television ministry.
[time=1765] When I say it was really given to us I mean that sincerely.
[time=1769] We were seated in the office of the president of WPTA, our good friend Mr. Ed Metcalf and he proposed the television ministry to us which is a rather strange way for a church
[time=1780] to get started in a television ministry.
[time=1782] It has been an exciting thing to see how God has blessed that work and frankly the radio and television ministries of this church have touched so many lives that only eternity will let us know what God has done through that ministry.
[time=1795] A little bit later on we began a ministry to women, women alive and in its zenith in the
[time=1801] beginning days of that work we ministered to over 250 ladies here on Tuesday as we taught the word of God in ladies bible study.
[time=1810] When God brought George Lantman to us and the super 60s ministry started and even today over 200 super 60s meet here every Friday morning as George leads them and teaches them
[time=1822] and helps them and ministers to them.
[time=1825] After that was started God opened the way for us to begin a counseling ministry and he brought to our midst Dr. Ken Nichols and today across the street from this facility is a counseling center with two full time counselors and a group of lay people who are being trained as lay counselors were literally touching hundreds of lives throughout this
[time=1845] community through the counseling ministry.
[time=1847] I remember in a message some months ago on a Sunday evening telling you that living at
[time=1853] the hub of all of this was sort of like being the man at the circuit who twirls plates at the end of a stick.
[time=1860] You get one plate going and it's going real good but by the time you do that you have to move over and get the other one twirling and you never get done changing from one plate to the other because one of them always needs a great deal of attention as God is my witness
[time=1874] that has been our history as a congregation.
[time=1878] When the church was healthy the television ministry was hurting when it got healthy the school needed help and I think God used all of this to keep us on our knees and humble before him because I cannot ever remember a time since we began when all of the ministries
[time=1892] were all healthy at one in the same time.
[time=1895] I doubt if that time will ever come.
[time=1898] God knows that we need to constantly be in a state of need so that we count on him for our resource.
[time=1904] Through the years he has shown us in a very dramatic way how we could meet the challenge financially of all of these ministries.
[time=1913] Some of the greatest days in the history of this church and of its ministry have been days when we have had an outpouring of giving and stewardship for the support of God's work here.
[time=1922] If I live to be a hundred I will never forget the Sunday when my wife and I stood at the
[time=1930] altar of our chapel our first worship building as the people of this congregation numbering
[time=1936] about 300 strong came to church that day to participate in what we call the impossible
[time=1943] offering.
[time=1944] We set a goal that day to raise $75,000 in cash gifts so that we could begin the construction
[time=1952] of this building.
[time=1955] It was indeed the impossible offering.
[time=1958] From the human perspective there was no way it could happen.
[time=1962] But I shall never forget what happened when that afternoon the man who was responsible for tallying what came in called me and said pastor the offering was $76,257.
[time=1974] That night we announced that to our congregation to the response of a unanimous applause.
[time=1980] Almost everybody stood to their feet not applauding themselves but the Lord.
[time=1985] It wasn't too long after that that God gave us the opportunity of television and it seemed
[time=1992] like we had just tapped all of the resources that were available for us to move ahead.
[time=1996] But God laid it upon the hearts of some businessmen in this community to give over $15,000 to
[time=2003] support half of the first year's television budget so the ministry that we're participating in right now could get started.
[time=2010] And just a few months after the impossible offering the television ministry started.
[time=2014] And out of that first $15,000 God has raised up a $350,000 a year television ministry
[time=2021] that literally blankets the Midwestern part of our country.
[time=2025] All of this has been a response in faith by God's people to the challenge of ministry and reaching people.
[time=2032] Shortly after that we had our together we build a program to get ready for the project at Arlington and on a Sunday night at the Lannon restaurant here with all of the congregation gathered in strength and in anticipation we were able to share with all of us that God
[time=2047] had laid it upon our hearts to give commitments and gifts of over $1 million to the future
[time=2053] ministry of this church.
[time=2056] I believe one of the greatest days we have ever had as a congregation was this present
[time=2062] year on Easter Sunday.
[time=2065] Where we challenged all of you to be a part of making sure that the general giving budget of this church was healthy and on Easter Sunday when we had a goal of $50,000 in the offering God's people here gave over $70,000 on one Sunday to the work of the ministry of
[time=2082] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2084] That may be all things considered the greatest thing that God has done through all of us
[time=2090] financially in the history of this church.
[time=2094] In just a few weeks I will be gone and someone else will be standing behind this desk taking
[time=2101] my place in leadership.
[time=2104] I am personally convinced that the greatest days of this church are yet ahead.
[time=2110] I believe that God has a plan for the ministry of this church and its outreach that will far surpass anything that you and I have ever dreamed.
[time=2118] Just as what we experience today is beyond the scope of what we dreamed in 1969 when
[time=2124] the church started so what God envisions for us in response to our faith in the future
[time=2131] is far ahead of anything you and I can conceive or dream in this hour.
[time=2137] And I want to do everything I can as a pastor who is moving to another assignment to secure
[time=2143] the future of this church in the best possible way.
[time=2146] I want to know as I leave and as you look for leadership that everything is in order
[time=2152] and that God can bless and use this congregation and that major problems which could arise
[time=2158] are solved and challenges are met.
[time=2162] That's why I want to ask all of you to join me in one more big challenge that we can share
[time=2168] together.
[time=2169] A challenge to move this congregation into the transition period with its major responsibilities
[time=2175] met with its indebtedness cared for in the areas of ministry so that the Board of Deacons
[time=2182] and the leadership of this church can give themselves totally to the selection of a new leader and the future ministry of this congregation.
[time=2191] Let me see if I can explain to you what I mean.
[time=2194] There are two ministries which have always been a great challenge to us financially.
[time=2199] They seem to have been in financial trouble more than the others altogether.
[time=2204] We praise God for George Lantman's leadership in the super sixty somehow he always makes that work and we never have to worry about that.
[time=2212] But the two ministries that seem to have been a continual drain upon us as an organization are the Christian school and the television ministry.
[time=2219] Television is easy to explain.
[time=2221] It is not a static ministry, it is a dynamic ministry.
[time=2225] By that I mean it is very difficult to predict what will happen in a given time, what kind of gifts and offerings will come in and that is compounded men and women because your pastor
[time=2236] has resisted the pressure that is put upon him by other media ministries to take time
[time=2243] in the service on television to ask for funds.
[time=2247] Very very seldom over the years of the television ministry have I taken any time from the service to talk about money and yet God has seen fit to almost see that ministry function in
[time=2258] the black and for the last few months it has functioned in the black and God has met the need.
[time=2263] But we have carried an indebtedness on the television ministry almost from its inception because
[time=2269] of the nature of our ministry and the large amount of money that it takes to operate it,
[time=2275] the cash flow of the ministry could care for some of that.
[time=2278] But it is not a healthy position for us to be in and already I have written to all of our television family asking them to join with me in this major project to see the indebtedness
[time=2289] in the television ministry completely destroyed before I leave.
[time=2294] And I am believing God in faith that that can happen.
[time=2298] I believe that the people who have participated in the television ministry and many of you who are watching now have been blessed by what God has done through the Bible Hour.
[time=2306] Many of you have told me as I have met you that it is a ministry that God has used to meet your need.
[time=2312] This week I met two young couples who told me that their parents watched the Bible Hour through the last days they spent on this earth and talked often of the ministry that it meant into their lives just before they died and went to be with the Lord.
[time=2326] And I know that God has used the Bible Hour in a signal way to bless many lives.
[time=2330] And so when I ask them this one time to help and encourage with their special giving I know that they will do it.
[time=2337] I don't think it's good for us as members of this church to be involved in dragging the
[time=2343] schools indebtedness with us into these next months.
[time=2347] It is not going to be healthy for us it will promote problems that we don't necessarily have to have.
[time=2353] I believe that we can underwrite as a congregation all that is necessary to totally obliterate
[time=2360] the indebtedness that the school has.
[time=2362] Now from the beginning of the school it has always been behind from day one and that is
[time=2368] due to a number of things.
[time=2370] First of all we have refused to charge enough tuition to pay all of the bills because we realized if we did that that no one would be able to offend to send their children to the school.
[time=2381] If we charged each parent a pro-rated portion of the cost of Christian education there would be no Christian school.
[time=2388] I couldn't afford it you couldn't afford it and if anyone could afford it we would have raised up a school for the elite which is not Christian education.
[time=2396] And so we have endeavored over the months of the operation of our school to try to figure out some way to make Christian education available to parents so their children could come and yet at the same time to keep the financial stability where it ought to be.
[time=2411] We have struggled with that like you cannot believe.
[time=2414] I have often asked my wife why do you suppose the Christian school is the Achilles heel financially of this organization.
[time=2421] We have finally come to understand that the reason it is so hard for it to function is simply this the Christian school has the greatest potential to affect lives for the future
[time=2431] in leadership for the Christian ministry and we should normally expect that Satan would
[time=2437] concentrate his energy where God could get the most good done in the long run and I believe
[time=2443] that he has done that.
[time=2444] Some of you who are a part of the school family know we have fought World War I, II and III, the Vietnam War and every other war you can think of just to keep Black Hawk Christian school going and alive.
[time=2455] The indebtedness on the school has fluctuated anywhere from 30,000 in the first year upwards
[time=2461] of 100 to 150,000 dollars and we have carried it and I have borne that on my shoulders as
[time=2467] a leader looking and seeking and trying to find ways to underwrite that indebtedness so
[time=2474] that the school could go on and families could send their children here without being taxed unduly.
[time=2480] We have always had fundraising projects.
[time=2483] We have had fundraising projects for the school.
[time=2486] We do not believe that the church should have fundraising projects.
[time=2489] It ought to operate on the ties and offerings of its people therefore we don't have bingo games and all kinds of functions here in the church building to support the church's ministry.
[time=2499] But every educational institution that I know of has a fundraising program to supplement
[time=2505] the income that comes from tuition and we have done that.
[time=2508] Some of you participated in the benefit living Christmas tree concert which raised over $30,000 for our school last December.
[time=2516] This past year one of the fundraising events that was proposed was an auction for the school
[time=2522] and it was assumed that we could perhaps do away with half of the school's indebtedness by raising $70,000 through that school auction.
[time=2531] I have to admit that that was one of the biggest failures we have ever had.
[time=2536] In fact we didn't even raise $5,000.
[time=2539] I've been trying to figure out what it's all about and I finally understood what's going on.
[time=2544] The folks in this congregation all love each other so much that when someone would bid on an object the other person would say, "Oh, I'll let Bill have that.
[time=2551] I love him and I'm not going to bid against him." And so everything we had at that auction went dirt cheap.
[time=2557] You could have gotten the best buy in town if you'd have come to that auction.
[time=2560] It was great for the participants but it sure didn't do any good for the school.
[time=2564] I'm not going to be around here when they deal with the auction of the future but I already believe there might be a better way.
[time=2571] I don't think Baptists are good auctioners.
[time=2573] I just don't think that's in our bag of tricks to raise money for the school.
[time=2578] I suppose that I feel a sense of guilt in this respect that I believe the ministries
[time=2584] of God belong to God's people and to his church.
[time=2589] And even though some of you think I've never been bashful to ask the congregation to give for the ministries of the church, I have resisted coming to this congregation to ask them to give to the ministry of the school for a number of reasons.
[time=2601] First of all, there are many folks in this congregation who do not believe in Christian education.
[time=2607] I could argue with you about that but that's just a matter of a point to make.
[time=2613] And so for you to give to something where your children are going to another institution, it's very difficult.
[time=2618] It is not the kind of a project that we can unite together on because not everybody's that much excited about Christian education.
[time=2624] I believe you should be but you aren't there yet.
[time=2628] Some day you will be but you're just moving along that continuum.
[time=2631] Then there are many older people in our congregation who must certainly feel like I've already paid to get one set of kids through school and I don't feel like going at it again.
[time=2641] And there are so many needs and so many challenges that we have as a congregation.
[time=2644] I have just resisted coming to the congregation and say, folks, we need to give to the operation of this school.
[time=2650] As I look back on that, I feel I have been wrong.
[time=2653] I think I've done the wrong thing.
[time=2654] If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't do it that way.
[time=2658] But I can't do it over.
[time=2659] All we can do is go from this point to the future and God has laid it upon my heart that
[time=2666] as a congregation before I leave, we take it as a project, as a congregation in unity
[time=2674] to give one more great sacrificial offering on July the 26th to totally do away with the
[time=2681] indebtedness of the school.
[time=2682] I've asked all the television people who are participating in this service today to get involved in a special project to help television be secure for the future.
[time=2692] And I personally believe that God is going to honor our faith as one more time we band together for the future.
[time=2699] And so it is that I am announcing today impossible offering number two.
[time=2706] You remember back when I announced the first one, I almost called it once in a lifetime offering.
[time=2712] God wouldn't let me do that.
[time=2714] I'm so glad.
[time=2715] Now I can come back and call this impossible offering number two.
[time=2719] It is impossible for us to do what I'm asking us to do, but I believe God is in it.
[time=2725] And I believe God will help us on July the 26th to receive an offering through this congregation and through the many people who participate out in the television ministry to raise the
[time=2736] money that is needed so that the need might be met in the school and in the area of television.
[time=2742] One of my deacons has suggested that impossible offering number two looks this way on paper.
[time=2748] I owe two, impossible offering two.
[time=2752] The more I thought about that, the better I liked it.
[time=2755] It says what needs to be said, I owe two.
[time=2759] Which of us, who of us, which one of us as members of this church in congregation can say that we don't have some responsibility for the ministries that we have voted on to
[time=2770] support, I owe two, and so do you.
[time=2774] And impossible offering number two can be the tool that God will use to cause the funds
[time=2780] that are needed for this ministry will be received.
[time=2784] I ask you to open your Bibles to 2 Corinthians and this will be the one service where I spend the least amount of time in the text because I have so many things on my heart to say to you.
[time=2795] But I want to remind you of something.
[time=2797] The Apostle Paul once directed the impossible offering and God gave him some tools to work
[time=2803] with.
[time=2804] He was trying to collect an impossible offering for all the poor saints in Jerusalem.
[time=2809] And so he wrote to the people at Corinth and he said, "This is what I want you to do." And he asked them to give sacrificially verses one through three.
[time=2818] And he asked them to give spontaneously or willingly verse three.
[time=2823] And he asked them to give selflessly verse four.
[time=2825] He said, "Do it for the ministering to the saints, not for yourselves, not for something you will get out of it, but do it for those in need." Some of you in the congregation may feel, "Well, I don't have anyone in the Christian school.
[time=2837] If I give to this project, men and women, the only real gift that we ever give to God is a gift that we give to Him for which we get nothing in return."
[time=2848] And one of the things that I think would be great for all of us is if we could get into the sacrificial, selfless spirit of this project, understanding that if I don't have any children or grandchildren or even neighbor children who will ever go to that school, it's a ministry God has raised up and I can give a selfless gift to make that ministry flourish in the days ahead.
[time=2868] Not only were they to give selfishly, but they gave systematically.
[time=2872] Paul had a plan.
[time=2873] You know what he did?
[time=2874] He sent Titus over there to teach him what to do.
[time=2876] He gave him an outline of how to accomplish the goal, and he taught them what they needed to do to see this offering raised.
[time=2883] They gave spiritually.
[time=2885] I've always been enamored with the seventh verse of 2 Corinthians 8, where Paul wrote, "Therefore as you abound in everything, in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love, see that you abound in this grace also." Paul put giving in very high company.
[time=2903] He said, "If you're into knowledge, and you're into faith, and you're into utterance, and you're into diligence, and you're into love, make sure you get into giving too, because they're all on the same level, they're all very high spiritual priorities." He didn't look at it as a gimmick to raise money.
[time=2919] He considered it a high spiritual challenge, and so do I.
[time=2924] He went on to say that they were to give sincerely for verses 8 and 9 talk about proving their love for God by a tangible gift.
[time=2933] Now here is our plan to meet this challenge.
[time=2935] Number one, on July 26th we will take the great sacrificial offering in the congregation.
[time=2942] And I am praying as I hope you will that God will lay it upon the hearts of many people to get involved so that that offering that day will be the greatest one we've ever taken.
[time=2953] Secondly, we're asking all of our television people to participate in underwriting the
[time=2960] television ministry.
[time=2962] Many of you who are watching today have planned some time to give a gift to say thank you for the ministry that comes into your home, but you've never done it.
[time=2971] The ministry has blessed you, and you've participated, but you've just been a receiver.
[time=2975] You haven't been involved in the ministry, and we're asking you both today and through the mail to get involved this one time at least to say thank you to God for what He has done for you through the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=2988] Then here in our congregation, I'm challenging the business and professional people in this church to give a sacrificial gift of at least a thousand dollars to this offering.
[time=3000] I did that not too long ago in preparation for the Easter offering, and someone walked out of this church and said I'm not ever going back there again, Pastor Jeremiah got up in the church and assessed every member a thousand dollars for an offering.
[time=3012] Well I didn't do that, I couldn't do it, you couldn't do it, and I know you couldn't do it, so I didn't do it.
[time=3018] If I'd have thought you could do it, I would have done it.
[time=3021] But that won't work, and it can't work, and not all of us are capable of doing that.
[time=3026] Some of you say, Pastor, why do you challenge people at that level?
[time=3029] I'll tell you one simple reason.
[time=3031] We have a lot of people in this congregation that God has blessed in a significant way, and if I just send out a challenge to you at the same level as I do for all the congregation, you will sit back in your chairs, and you will do the least amount that's necessary just to feel a part of the offering, and God isn't honored by that.
[time=3048] My job is and always has been to challenge you at the level of your ability.
[time=3053] The Bible says we are to give as God has prospered us, not as we feel comfortable giving.
[time=3060] So that's why I challenge you to give that way, and some of you can do it, and I know you will, and you will be filled with joy in doing it.
[time=3066] Folks, if we reach the goal, it will take 25 to 30 people giving a gift of at least that much to make the offering happen.
[time=3074] And then all of us will have to do at least a double tithe on that Sunday.
[time=3078] We'll have to give at least twice what we're giving.
[time=3080] Now, you've got a whole month to worry about that.
[time=3083] You can go back home and ask God to show you how to do it.
[time=3085] Maybe you'll have a good crop in your garden, sell a lot of cucumbers, or sell something that you got that you don't need, but you pray that God will help you to figure out a way to do that on that Sunday so that we can all fellowship in that offering in a special way.
[time=3098] Now, one last thing in the plan.
[time=3100] I may get out of here without seeing this, but I have always dreamed that someday someone
[time=3106] would walk up to me just out of the blue that I didn't even know, maybe had no idea they would do it and say, "Pastor Dave, God has blessed me in a very unusual way.
[time=3114] My ship came in, my inheritance came down.
[time=3117] I've got $150,000 I just want to give to the church." One of my friends over in Elkhart had a man walk in his office one day and gave him a million and a half dollars to build a brand new high school.
[time=3129] He called me on the phone and he said, "Pastor, I'm really praying." He said, "This is such an overwhelming thing.
[time=3133] I'm not sure I'm going to be able to handle it." I said, "Well, if you can't handle it, you call me.
[time=3138] I'll be happy to talk with you about how we can handle it." I pray that maybe even in this interim period, maybe somebody watching by television has been so blessed by this ministry, I want to give a one-time gift, a magnificent gift to God.
[time=3152] What a thrilling thing that would be.
[time=3154] It would just fill me with joy for that to happen even when I wouldn't be around to participate in it.
[time=3159] I pray that God will do that and I believe He will in some measure.
[time=3164] What will this do for us as a church?
[time=3166] Let me give you four things.
[time=3169] Four things it will do for us.
[time=3170] Number one, it will secure our ministry for the interim.
[time=3175] Every summer, we go through a cash flow problem in this church.
[time=3178] One simple reason, the tendencies go down while people are on vacation.
[time=3181] Some folks forget what they're supposed to do during that time and don't do it.
[time=3185] The tuition for the school doesn't come in during the summer, but we still have to keep right on paying all the salaries and bills, and so summer is a real challenge.
[time=3193] I have never pastored this church during the summer when on June 1, I didn't say to myself and to my wife and to the business manager, "I don't know how in the world we're going to make it through the summer." Every summer, somehow, we make it, and we will this summer too.
[time=3206] But this offering will secure the stability of this ministry.
[time=3210] Number two, and this is the one I want to just shout, "It will silence the critics of the ministry." Throughout all my years of the pastor of this church, wherever I've gone, sooner or later somebody would say to me, "Pastor Jeremiah, what in the world will they ever do over there if you leave?" And I've always said, "Look, if God brought me here, He sure can bring somebody else here." I remember somebody telling me, "The measure of your importance to an organization is what happens when you put your finger in a glass of water and pull it out.
[time=3236] The hole that's left is how much you're needed." I suppose there's some truth to that.
[time=3242] But folks, one of the things that excites me about this offering and about the progress for the future is this.
[time=3247] All of these critics who feel like this ministry has been built on one man are going to find out that it never was that in the first place.
[time=3254] It was built upon the principles of the Word of God and upon God Himself and upon the people of God who are part of the congregation.
[time=3261] And when we put this offering together, we're going to say a great big buoy to the people who've always said what they've said, and I want to be around at least for a short time after that happens so I can go and say, "I told you so."
[time=3276] The last thing it'll do is it will solidify the unity of this church, the leadership and the membership, joining together for the future of the congregation.
[time=3285] I want to ask you today, and I've felt it important enough to take this whole message to ask you to begin praying now, and if God wants to use you to be one of those who will give a major gift, I want you to tell me today or in these next days that you'll be one of that number to encourage my heart and to commit your heart to do it.
[time=3304] God will honor it and His name will be lifted up and glorified as we do this one more thing
[time=3310] together.
[time=3311] Shall we pray?
[time=3313] Father, we just pray that even though we've devoted this whole hour to the presentation
[time=3322] of this need.
[time=3324] You've been sharing the Bible hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=3327] If as a result of this program, you have made a decision about your relationship to Jesus
[time=3333] Christ, we would like to send you some material which will help you.
[time=3338] Please write to us and indicate the nature of your decision.
[time=3342] Here today, Pastor Jeremiah offered to send you his latest booklet entitled "Four Thousand
[time=3348] Questions and Answers on the Bible." To receive this helpful guide, you may call toll-free 1-800-453-9000.
[time=3359] Already hundreds of people have found this booklet to be helpful.
[time=3364] Once again, all you have to do is call toll-free 1-800-453-9000.
[time=3372] If you would like to receive a cassette copy of Pastor Jeremiah's sermon, write to Pastor
[time=3380] David Jeremiah, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3387] To identify today's sermon as the one you would like to receive, use number 984.
[time=3394] Please enclose a gift of three dollars to help defray the cost of providing this take.
[time=3403] Speaking for Pastor David Jeremiah, this is Jack Gray, inviting you to join us every
[time=3411] week, if it's time for the Bible Hour.
[time=3415] This program has been made possible by the members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who regularly support this outreach ministry.
[time=3425] To learn how you can become a part of the Founders Club, please write directly to Pastor
[time=3431] David Jeremiah, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3443] During this past hour, I've had the opportunity to bear my soul to the people of this church regarding the needs that we have financially during this time.
[time=3452] Most of you who have watched the Bible Hour know that I have very seldom taken any time away from the ministry of the Word of God and music to talk about finances on this program.
[time=3462] But just as I have talked pointedly to our people in the church this morning, I want to talk pointedly to you for just a moment.
[time=3469] The Bible Hour is not the ministry of David Jeremiah, it's your ministry.
[time=3474] It belongs to you.
[time=3476] Each week as we come into your home with the Word of God, you participate on the other end of the communication cycle.
[time=3484] Right now it's very important that you get more involved in the ministry during this transition time.
[time=3490] If the Bible Hour is going to move into its next phase of ministry, it will be absolutely crucial that you have a part in the transition that we're going through right now.
[time=3502] Many of you I have heard from recently have told me that you have watched the Bible Hour for many months and you have never ever contributed to its ministry.
[time=3511] I'm going to ask that now at this very special time you sit down and write me a letter and
[time=3517] enclose the largest gift you can give to the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=3521] Do it in thanksgiving for what God has done in your life through the ministry during these years.
[time=3526] Do it for the future of the Bible Hour, but do it today so that we may continue to see this program go forward in the years ahead proclaiming the same truth with the same power
[time=3538] that it has in the years past.
[time=3540] Send your gift to Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3547] Do it today while this message is fresh in your mind, God will honor you for it and the Word of God through the Bible Hour television ministry will continue to go forth in power.
