[time=30] In the invocation center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=60] [Bell]
[time=74] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=80] And I am certain that you can tell by the way we have changed things around today that this is a very special Sunday.
[time=88] This is the July 4th weekend here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=92] For those of you who are watching by television on a delayed network and today is the day when we celebrate being Americans.
[time=100] Tonight here in this auditorium at 5 o'clock and again at 8 o'clock we will be sharing our annual patriotic presentation
[time=108] and it's filled with music and excitement about what it means to be a part of this great country.
[time=114] We are going to hear some music from our choir and musicians in the patriotic theme that I know will really be a blessing to you.
[time=122] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=241] Thank you choir. We're so happy that we can have the freedom to celebrate our freedom.
[time=248] We believe that being good Americans is part of being a good Christian and we don't in any way apologize
[time=256] for waving the flag around here. I haven't been in a lot of other countries in this great universe.
[time=262] I've been in a few and I know we have a few problems here that we're always working on but I can't find any place
[time=269] that even has a better report than we have and I'm just grateful to God that in his sovereignty
[time=275] he allowed me the privilege of being born an American and to enjoy the freedom that that entails.
[time=282] Some more red, white and blue music comes from Steve and Maria Gardner as they share with us now.
[time=288] [MUSIC]
[time=308] My country tees of the sweet land of liberty of the I.C.
[time=320] Land where my father's died land of the pilgrim spright from every mountain's silent freedom reign.
[time=337] Our father's gone to the author of liberty to thee we say.
[time=352] Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light protect us by thy might great God our King.
[time=373] [MUSIC]
[time=379] America America God shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea.
[time=408] [MUSIC]
[time=418] God bless America land that I love stand beside her and guide her through the night with a light from above.
[time=437] From the mountains to the prairies to the oceans white with foam God bless America my home sweet home.
[time=488] My home sweet home God bless America my home sweet home.
[time=517] [MUSIC]
[time=522] Well this is the July 4th weekend here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and even though many of you are watching this on a delayed basis.
[time=528] We are grateful that we can share all of the beautiful music of our wonderful country and all of the exciting things that go on here during that particular weekend.
[time=539] Right now Don and I have some very important things to share with you.
[time=542] In fact we've got quite an agenda for this little time this morning and we ought to get started quickly.
[time=546] First of all I want to remind you that one of our purposes in the Bible our ministry is to put into your hands literature that will help you be knowledgeable about the Word of God and about your own life.
[time=557] I doubt if there's ever been a time in the history of our country when we've had more interest in the concepts of prophecy.
[time=564] So much that's going on around the world causes us to wonder about the things the Bible says about the end times.
[time=572] Our special gift to you this week is a booklet that I have written that contains two messages that I preached entitled.
[time=579] First of all are we living in the last days and then secondly the Battle of Armageddon.
[time=585] These two messages outline some of the events that will take place in the last days according to the Bible.
[time=591] And as you study the book you will discover that some of the things that are happening today are those very things that have been prophesied in the Scripture
[time=599] to signal the end of our time here on this earth.
[time=603] The booklet is filled with Scripture and factual information and it's our privilege to send it to you free and postage paid this week if you'll just write and let us know.
[time=612] If you'll write to us at Post Office Box 15,000 and ask for the booklet on the last times we'll be happy to send it to you this week.
[time=621] And of course you can call us if you like to and Donna before you share our sponsors why don't you let them know how they can do that.
[time=628] We have a toll free number and that number is 1-800-4539,000.
[time=634] You may call that number anytime not just today but anytime during the week.
[time=638] Ask for the Bible Hour operator and tell her that you would like the booklet offered on today's broadcast.
[time=644] And we have two associate sponsors today on the Bible Hour.
[time=648] We have Sue Guthrie who views the Bible Hour on Channel 21 here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=654] And then we have one from way down in Memphis, Tennessee who views us on the National Christian Network.
[time=660] And we thank you folks so much for the part that you've had in sponsoring today's broadcast.
[time=666] Donna, I have just recently written to all of our television friends asking them to help us in a very special financial drive that will preserve the Bible Hour through the transition.
[time=676] As most of you know last week we shared with you that very soon we'll be beginning a new ministry in San Diego, California.
[time=682] And the Bible Hour will continue to have a ministry here through television right into your home.
[time=687] One of the greatest goals in my life right now is to do everything I can to clean up all of the indebtedness the Bible Hour has so that it can move into this new phase of its ministry without any of the excess baggage that we've been pulling along behind us.
[time=702] I have spoken to you about this on television and this week I've written to most of you who are on our mailing list a very special letter that I hope you will read carefully.
[time=713] This letter outlines the plan for the recovery of this indebtedness so that we can send the Bible Hour into this new chapter of its life absolutely free of any indebtedness and ready to go on carrying the gospel to the many hundreds of homes in this area in the days ahead.
[time=729] Our goal for this financial drive is to totally wipe out the $70,000 worth of indebtedness that we have carried most of it from the very beginning of this ministry.
[time=739] We need your help as never before and we want to ask you when you receive this letter from our office, this personal letter from me, to sit down and prayerfully consider what you can do to help us at this time.
[time=751] Most of you who have been watching the Bible Hour know that very seldom have we ever asked for funds on the air. We have reserved the air time so that we might use it to encourage and strengthen your life.
[time=761] But this one time, this last time, I want to ask you to help and I hope you'll do the very best you can to participate with us.
[time=769] Some of you can use this as an opportunity to express your appreciation for what the Bible Hour has meant in your life and the life of your family and friends over these past four or five years.
[time=779] Donna, we've already received some preliminary gifts and as I've read the letters that have come into our office, I've been reminded of how precious every single gift really is.
[time=788] We were talking about that this week that when we see how sacrificially these people give, it makes us want to squeeze every penny for the cause of Christ so that it can be used in the very best possible way.
[time=801] I ask you to share one of those letters because I think it expresses the heartfelt attitude of so many people who participate in this ministry.
[time=810] This is just one of the many letters that we've received and they've been such an encouragement to us in these days when we've had a lot of mixed emotions about what's happening in our personal lives.
[time=820] Here is ten dollars to help on that debt. I am very sorry but that is all I am able to do but I'm praying you will be blessed and able to get the rest.
[time=830] I am a crippled widow living in this old people's home so I hope you will understand and we certainly do understand and over the years that we've been on the air, it hasn't been the large contributions that have kept us on the air and kept this ministry alive.
[time=844] It has been the sacrificial gifts of many people like this widow that has made it all possible.
[time=850] That's why we're so excited about what you're going to do. Some of you are able to do above and beyond anything that we've even thought of.
[time=858] And what God wants from all of us is just to do what we can do.
[time=864] This woman whom Donna has referenced is doing all she can do and God honors that and she's blessed indeed.
[time=870] And if you'll do all you can do, God will honor and bless you too and this ministry can go forward without ever missing any opportunity to preach the gospel.
[time=879] This one time we're asking for your help. We need you to participate with us in this great fun drive and we hope that before we leave we'll be able to announce to all of you that this indebtedness has been completely destroyed
[time=892] and the Bible hour is free from the shackles of this burden to go forward in great power to reach the masses for Christ.
[time=900] Do what you can do today. When you receive the letter, please read it prayerfully and carefully.
[time=905] Let me remind you again just before we go back to our service that if you would like to have this free copy of this book of two messages are we living in the last days in the battle of Armageddon, call us at our toll free number 1-800-4539000
[time=920] or write to me Pastor David Jeremiah post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and we'll be happy to send this special booklet of messages to you.
[time=930] It's one of the last times I'll be able to send you something that I've personally been involved with and I'd really appreciate the opportunity of putting this in the mail to you today.
[time=938] So call us a write us and we'll be happy to respond.
[time=941] Now we're going back to the morning service, more music of patriotism and the joy of our country and then a message from the Word of God.
[time=950] [MUSIC]
[time=980] Proudly it waves old glory over the land of the free.
[time=997] Promise of hope and freedom, symbol of liberty.
[time=1009] Red, white and blue are its colors, colors both brilliant and clear.
[time=1020] Colors but for deeper meaning, land that at first may appear.
[time=1034] Red is for blood, of patrons who have died to free us.
[time=1046] White is for justice and government of life.
[time=1057] Blue is for honor and faith in glory too.
[time=1070] This is my flag.
[time=1076] This is all glory, the red, white and blue.
[time=1089] [MUSIC]
[time=1118] Proudly it waves old glory over the land of the free.
[time=1139] Promise of hope and freedom, symbol of liberty.
[time=1151] Red, white and blue are its colors, colors both brilliant and clear.
[time=1162] Colors with for deeper meaning, land that at first may appear.
[time=1175] Red is for blood, of patrons who have died to free us.
[time=1189] White is for justice and government of life.
[time=1201] Blue is for honor and faith in glory too.
[time=1214] This is my flag.
[time=1220] This is all glory, the red, white and blue.
[time=1238] Long made way for the home of the brave.
[time=1280] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1295] That was Keith Brodigam and Starr Narwald in the solo and duet parts.
[time=1301] They were accompanied by our women's group, Strictly Feminine.
[time=1306] One of the songs from the Patriotic Panorama that will be a part of the total presentation tonight as we wave the flag proudly and are excited about our country.
[time=1316] Just before the message we're going to hear from the Black Hawk Singers and there is a narration that goes along with this.
[time=1323] This also is a part of the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1326] I think it's just a great thing that we started many years ago on this July 4 weekend, which oftentimes is a, well, it's a down weekend for churches.
[time=1337] And we have been able by waving the flag to turn this weekend into one of the great, big, exciting weekends of the year.
[time=1344] And we're excited that we can share at least a portion of the program with our many friends at home.
[time=1349] Listen now to the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1353] [MUSIC]
[time=1359] I was born in American.
[time=1362] No other country on earth will ever hold the spell over me that America holds.
[time=1367] Between the Atlantic and the Pacific lies a magnificently varied land.
[time=1372] Rugged mountains, rolling plains, arid deserts, endless forests, mighty rivers and placid lakes.
[time=1382] Our forefathers, rugged pioneers, carved out our liberty in the grandeur of this wilderness.
[time=1389] They have bequeathed to me the responsibility for this great land.
[time=1393] Until the day I die, I will shoulder it, because I love America.
[time=1401] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=1521] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers, and the narration was provided by Lydia Lydiqui, just a portion of the patriotic panorama which we shall see in its entirety here in Fort Wayne this evening.
[time=1532] I have been preaching during these weeks on the priorities of the church, and it has been a good experience for me to go back through the various things that are a part of a church's ministry,
[time=1545] and to reemphasize the basic priorities that make a church what it is.
[time=1551] We have talked about the priority being preaching, and people, and prayer.
[time=1557] And last week we began a series of three on the priority of personal evangelism.
[time=1564] Last Sunday night here in our congregation, as we met, I shared the positive thrust of evangelism as a command from God.
[time=1574] The responsibility that we have to be obedient to that command.
[time=1578] Today I want to do something that will probably get me into a great deal of difficulty with some folks,
[time=1585] but I hope it will be used of God to clarify our perspective as a church and as individuals on the critical importance of evangelism.
[time=1594] When this church started in 1969, I was called here as the pastor from an associate responsibility that I had in New Jersey,
[time=1603] and landed here when there were no buildings, just a group of seven families that deeply believed God wanted to have a church in the Blackhawk community.
[time=1615] During those early days after we moved into the mobile units, which were our first home, I remember spending a great deal of time contemplating on the importance of church growth.
[time=1625] All I had to do was look at that little auditorium on a given Sunday morning with more empty chairs than filled chairs,
[time=1631] and I had great motivation to learn about how a church grows.
[time=1635] I came up with several ways that a church could grow, one of which was through transfer growth,
[time=1641] the opportunity of Christians to move into our community and join our church from other churches and other parts of the world.
[time=1648] I didn't dwell on that too long because I could not imagine anybody in their right mind passing up the opportunity
[time=1654] to attend the circle church over on the other side of town from which we came so that they could come and worship in our little mobile units.
[time=1661] I just didn't think anybody get too excited about that.
[time=1664] I thought a little bit about natural growth, and that of course is what happens when a church has adults,
[time=1671] and the adults have babies, and the babies grow up in the congregation to be a part of the family.
[time=1675] I thought it might take a long time for us to build a church that way.
[time=1679] Had I known how prolific our people were to be, I probably wouldn't have worried about it so much back in those early days,
[time=1685] and I certainly have done my part to contribute to church growth since those early days.
[time=1690] I came here with no little arrows in my quiver, and I have four now, so I have done my part.
[time=1696] Suddenly it began to dawn on me that the only way a church could grow was the way God intended it to grow in the first place,
[time=1702] and that is through spiritual multiplication, one Christian telling another Christian how to find Christ.
[time=1711] That was a very, very difficult time in my life because having had eight years of professional training,
[time=1717] it suddenly dawned on me that I didn't know anything at all about how to win someone to Christ.
[time=1722] I was totally ineffective as an evangelist.
[time=1724] I could not remember one single person that I'd ever won to Christ personally before I was called as the pastor of this church.
[time=1732] That was a devastating thing.
[time=1734] Here I was supposedly the leader of the people, and I didn't know how to do it myself.
[time=1740] I remember praying in those early days, "Oh God, make me a soul winner and show me how to do what I need to do
[time=1746] so I can teach these others how to do it, or I'm going to get out of the ministry." I knew so many pastors who were right where I was, but weren't willing to admit it, and they spent their whole life trying to cover up for their ineffectiveness and evangelism by doing a host of other things which were good, but never really accomplished the goal.
[time=1765] It was about that time that I got a hold of a tape of a transcript of Dr. James Kennedy's presentation of the gospel,
[time=1771] and I began to listen to that and study it and learn it.
[time=1775] And I practiced on my wife and on my friends until I knew how to present the gospel, and I prayed that God would give me someone to share the gospel with.
[time=1783] Some of you know the story of George and Jeffleene Paragoy coming to visit us one Sunday
[time=1789] after I had spoken at a PTA meeting at the school around the corner here.
[time=1794] We met them at the door and we glad handed them, "You can be sure." They were the first red-blooded American visitors we'd had, and everybody in the church made them feel welcome.
[time=1804] I told them that I wanted to come and visit them, and I did.
[time=1808] Knocked on their door, and I shall never forget the fear in my heart.
[time=1812] This was the first opportunity for me to present the gospel.
[time=1815] When I knocked on the door, George came to the door, and I don't know if he remembers what he said, but I'll never forget it. He said, "Pastor Jeremiah, we've been looking for Christ, and we sure hope you can help us find him." Well, I figured if I didn't do something right that night, there was no hope for me as an evangelist.
[time=1833] I was really frightened, and I went in and sat down having learned the evangelism explosion.
[time=1838] What I did that night, if I remember correctly, was something of a combination between the Roman road, the Four Spiritual Laws, the Kennedy program, and anything else I'd ever heard about evangelism.
[time=1848] How those folks ever got saved that night, I don't know.
[time=1852] It convinced me once and for all that salvation is of the Lord by the Holy Spirit and is not really conducive on our being, that it apt at doing it.
[time=1862] The next week, they came forward in our church and professed their faith in Christ, and frankly, this church and this pastor have never been the same sense.
[time=1872] My desire for evangelism continued to grow until we began to train others, and at one time in the peak of the ministry here, we had over a hundred people going out in evangelism every week, sharing their faith, telling others how to find Christ.
[time=1888] The church began to grow, and many of the needs of the church became quite apparent, and individuals within the congregation would carry those needs to me and impress upon me the importance of this and that, and I would listen, and I had many in-depth sessions with folks who were deeply concerned about our evangelistic thrust that wasn't always coupled with the best follow-up program that we could have had, and the word discipleship began to be heard often in our conversations.
[time=1913] Oftentimes, I would come away from those sessions feeling very guilty.
[time=1918] I would be told often that we were winning people to Christ, but we weren't caring for them properly, and there was truth in that.
[time=1925] We weren't really doing all we could do in follow-up.
[time=1928] But something very interesting began to happen, and that is that the discipleship urge among folks here began to have an impact on me to the extent that I began to feel like there was something more perhaps important than even evangelism, and that was discipleship.
[time=1945] Some of the things that are often used to express discipleship in those terms
[time=1951] are phrases like this.
[time=1954] We care enough to spend time with a new convert, or we're like the Marines.
[time=1962] We just want a few good men, or try this one on.
[time=1967] Quality is more important than quantity.
[time=1972] Oftentimes, I would be reminded in my conversations about how much time Jesus spent primarily with just a few men building into their lives so that the work of the church could go forward.
[time=1984] One day a man looked me right in the eye and he said, "Pastor, you may be doing more in your evangelism, but I'm doing it better." And he meant by that that he was building into the life of this individual.
[time=1995] I've had several years now to test what has happened here since we have made that delicate change in our emphasis from a strong emphasis on evangelism
[time=2006] to a rather lesser emphasis on evangelism coupled with an emphasis on "discipleship." And I probably won't make too many confessions before I leave, but I want to tell you that I confess that the shift was a mistake.
[time=2022] What has happened in our church and in many of our lives is this,
[time=2029] that this approach to discipleship has given many who lean away from evangelism
[time=2035] and soul-winning a haven of respectability.
[time=2040] So that rather than follow the Great Commission, which has been given to us to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and disciple them, which means getting them baptized and into a local church, we have decided that the importance of the ministry is now centered around meeting in small groups and discipling each other while the world around us is dying and going to hell.
[time=2064] I've spent a great deal of time studying this problem, and I knew that someday I would tell you what I felt and what I had learned today is the day.
[time=2075] There are some problems with this approach that we need to be very aware of.
[time=2080] First of all, this approach to discipleship, and please understand my terminology,
[time=2086] I believe in the follow-up of new believers in instructing them in the basic tenets of the gospel and of assurance and of prayer and Bible study, but I'm not talking about that when I use the term discipleship today, I'm talking about discipleship that doesn't deal with the basic tenets with new believers, but takes mature believers and puts them in a small group and gets them involved with each other instead of being involved with the world.
[time=2112] The problem with this whole concept of discipleship is, number one, it's built on the wrong foundation.
[time=2119] Here's the foundation of that kind of discipleship. Listen carefully.
[time=2122] Jesus spent time training the Twelve to carry out His message, and if we just spend our time with a few, they will become disciples to win our world for Christ.
[time=2137] Now I want to say something to you, and I hope you'll take it reverently.
[time=2141] If Jesus chose His disciples to be the hope of His kingdom on earth,
[time=2147] men and women, He was a colossal failure.
[time=2154] After three years of discipling, every one of them left Him except one when He needed them the most.
[time=2162] Just before the Roman soldiers are to come and get Him in the garden, He took Peter, James, and John and asked them to pray.
[time=2170] These were the finest He had. They had received the best He could give,
[time=2176] but when He comes to check on their prayer ministry, He discovers that in the hour of His agony, His three best disciples have fallen asleep, not just one time, but three times until finally He just gave up on them.
[time=2190] Now another disciple by the name of Judas comes to betray Him.
[time=2196] In fact, someone has said that the discipleship program of the Lord Jesus Christ produced.
[time=2201] Peter the denier, Judas the betrayer, James and John, and Peter, the disciple sleepers, James the son of Alphaeus, who did nothing worth telling, Thomas the skeptic and five others who when faced with the danger of sacrifice went and hid.
[time=2217] When his discipleship program was finished at the foot of the cross, as he is dying for the world, he looks down and out of the twelve there's one left.
[time=2226] And he says, "John, please take care of my mother." You say, "Were these men not important to Jesus Christ?" Of course they were. They were critically important to Him, and he also administered to the masses. He had 120 disciples beside the twelve.
[time=2245] In fact, it's interesting to note that when he spoke on the subject of discipleship, it was not to the twelve, it was to the masses.
[time=2253] You say, "But Pastor Jeremiah, how do you explain the explosion of the New Testament church in the Book of Acts?"
[time=2260] If it wasn't, our Lord's methodology and discipleship with the twelve.
[time=2264] Well, there are two reasons for it. First is the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the second was the day of Pentecost.
[time=2272] There is no evidence that the disciples were ready to do anything until Jesus came out of the grave, and then they became bold. And on the day of Pentecost, when they were filled with the Spirit of God,
[time=2283] they were revolutionized, and that's when they went out from that experience to turn the world upside down for their Savior.
[time=2290] G. Campbell Morgan has written that one half hour after Pentecost, those disciples knew more about Jesus Christ than they ever known before.
[time=2298] You see, it wasn't the training of the twelve that made the difference, it was the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2306] We have tried to package up God's program in some neat little manual that we can put on somebody else,
[time=2312] but men and women, we can meet in small groups until the kingdom comes, and we can learn all the truth there is to learn, and if the Spirit of God has not filled us and we are not controlled by the Spirit of God, we will never win anybody to Christ.
[time=2326] You say, but the resurrection, which means our conversion, and the day of Pentecost, which speaks of the infilling of the Spirit, pastor, those are mysterious things. How do you describe them? How do you document them?
[time=2338] Well, I don't know, but that explains a lot of things I've never been able to understand.
[time=2342] Do you know we win people to Christ in this church?
[time=2346] And sometimes we have neglected them terribly, and we ought to be ashamed of that.
[time=2350] But some of the folks we've neglected, and we haven't really spent any time with, they catch fire for God, and they start to grow, and you look out and you say, well, how did they get followed up?
[time=2361] Dawson Trotman, who started the Navigators, which has done a great deal in helping follow-up material become available to churches, one day was asked by a friend.
[time=2371] How did you get followed up? He said, followed up?
[time=2375] I'll tell you who followed me up, the Blessed Trinity, that's who.
[time=2381] You see, we have tried to put into a program what God ordained to be in a person. The person of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and his Spirit, the Holy Spirit, who comes to live within us.
[time=2394] And as we look at what happened to the disciples after the day of Pentecost, when they were filled with the Spirit, we then understand why the church flourished and grew.
[time=2402] Now, I'm not saying that training isn't important, that inductive Bible study and follow-up to help us understand what goes on in the churches is not important, but men and women, that will not do for us.
[time=2414] What a clear conviction of our salvation and a filling of the Holy Spirit will do for anyone, and it's available without a class, without a Bible study program, without anything. It comes right from God.
[time=2426] The first problem, then, is we built this whole program in the wrong foundation.
[time=2430] We thought that was Christ's method for the growth of the church, and we missed it.
[time=2434] The second thing that's wrong with it is this, it bypasses personality.
[time=2438] You know what I notice when I study the disciples of our Lord?
[time=2442] I discover that after they've been discipled, they still have their same personalities.
[time=2446] Philip is still cautious. Andrew is still timid. Peter is still brash and boisterous. Thomas is still kind of a skeptic and moderate heart.
[time=2458] Sometimes, and it certainly hasn't been true in this church, but as I've examined discipleship in other places, I've discovered that this one-on-one discipleship is almost like spiritual cloning. You ever notice that?
[time=2470] Some guy gets up next to a fellow who is his leader, and the next thing you know, he begins to walk like him. He begins to look like him. He combs his hair like him. He talks like him. He uses the same phrases.
[time=2482] And he totally loses his own individuality. Why in the world do you think God made us all different? He made us different because he's got a distinct and individual job for each of us to do.
[time=2494] And if we get so involved in rubber stamp discipleship that we start coming out, just like the person, pretty soon there's no individuality in our world and the people that God caused you to be born, exactly as you are so you could win them, those folks can't get one.
[time=2512] I think an illustration might help. There's a great Bible teacher who has one, literally hundreds of people to Christ and help many others grow by the name of Bill Gothard. Some of you have been to his seminars. He is a great Bible teacher. He's coming to Fort Wayne, and I heartily recommend that you all go and hear him.
[time=2528] It's much good to offer. But you know, I pray to God after you come back from that seminar. You don't come back to this church speaking Gothardese. Do you ever hear Gothardese? Well, you've got to study the vocabulary to figure out what's being talked about. You see what happens is instead of taking the truth and integrating it into your own personality,
[time=2548] you take the personality, the language, the vocabulary, the words, and you become a little Bill Gothard walking around in your world and it's ugly.
[time=2556] Sometimes this one-on-one thing where you spend all your time with one person
[time=2562] causes you to lose all of your individuality. You know, that's what Paul was dealing with in the church at Corinth.
[time=2568] In the first chapter he wrote to those folks and he said, "I hear there's divisions among you, and I partly believe it."
[time=2574] He said, "Some of you have gotten all revved up about Cephas, and some of the rest of you are all turned on by Apollus, and some of the rest of you are all turned on by Paul, and some of you are being spiritual, and you say, "You're turned on by Christ, but there's no unity in the body because you've splintered off after your discipleship leaders." You've lost your individuality.
[time=2594] Then Paul said, "But Christ sent me not to baptize anybody but to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ." Sometimes discipleship causes individuals to lose their identity.
[time=2606] Now thirdly, listen carefully now. This isn't true of all discipleship.
[time=2610] It's not true of most that I know of that goes on here, but it is a dangerous thing that oftentimes discipleship, deceptive discipleship, boycotts the church.
[time=2622] Listen now.
[time=2624] A small group can become a monastic disassociation from the rest of the body.
[time=2630] There are a lot of folks who assume that together for study is an active discipleship.
[time=2639] You say to somebody, "What are you doing in your Christian life? Well, I'm into discipleship." What does that mean? Well, every Tuesday night we get together and we have our little growth.
[time=2646] That's not discipleship. That's study.
[time=2650] If I understand the term as being a disciple, and if you're a disciple you're going to act like a disciple, and that's why Jesus said when he called his disciples "Follow me and I'll make you to become a fisher of men." Discipleship is an activity.
[time=2666] It is involved in being obedient to God. Certainly we need to study the Bible.
[time=2670] Certainly we need to pray for each other. But meeting in a small group around a table in somebody's living room is not discipleship if it does not eventuate in doing what a disciple does.
[time=2682] True discipleship you see means that the disciple has some of the same goals as the master.
[time=2690] Being committed to discipleship has an additional dimension in growing churches. It means involvement. And folks, one of the things that scares me, and as I talk to pastors who come in for our Bible study this summer, for our summer Bible conference and as I get out in other churches, I know that pastors all over this country are frightened by it because so much of that which is going on in terms of discipleship these days is nothing else than the discipling of individuals away from the local church. We have Bible studies in place of our prayer meetings. We have home discipleship groups in place of our evening services. We have decentralized into all of the discipleship groups and the church has lost its corporate identity.
[time=2734] I got to tell you a story about a friend of mine by the name of John MacArthur who I was with at Moody Bible Conference just recently.
[time=2742] If you know John you'll understand this.
[time=2746] He went on a sabbatical not too long ago and when he came back he discovered that some of his staff had gotten really caught up in the flock ministry and in the small group Bible study ministry and we're really teaching some great truths that need to be taught about the identity of small groups with one another and caring for each other in those small groups and all of that's important. It's critically important and we do that here. We don't want to ever not do that but John was telling me at dinner one night that he got up to go to church one Sunday morning and a car pulled in his driveway and these folks from his group got out. One of them had a bucket in the hand the other had a squeegee and they had some other things they were going and John said what are you doing?
[time=2782] They said well pastor John you're in our group and we want to care for you and we know you've been gone your house needs to really be worked over and we came over to wash your windows and get everything spruced up and this is really the only chance we had to do it.
[time=2794] John said during church he said I put the bucket back in the car I put the squeegee back in the car I put him in I locked the car up and said go home get dressed and get to church discipleship that takes you away from the local church cannot be biblical discipleship because the local church is the one thing God has ordained for the furtherance and growth of individuals and the body and men and women if we're involved in something that takes us away from the centrality of the local church you call it what you want it's not new testament discipleship always like the first chapter of the book of Acts I think says it pretty clearly in Acts chapter 1 verses 6 through 8 there's an interesting thing going on in this chapter that I hope you won't ever miss. The disciples are together and it says when they therefore were come together they ask of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel and he said to them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. What does he say?
[time=2862] The disciples said Lord we'd like to have a little prophecy conference. Let's talk about the end time let's talk about the seasons and the times and when you're coming back Lord can you give us some insight into the future ministry of the church and the Lord said listen it's not for you to know that stuff one thing you can know is the Holy Spirit's going to come upon you and you're going out and witness in all parts of the world. A lot of Christians that feel a great deal of security in small sequestered groups away from the world that needs them so badly feeding on each other while the world out there is dying because somebody hasn't told them about the Savior. So often we forget that God knows the difference between devotional idleness and loving action.
[time=2907] The fourth problem with this kind of discipleship men and women is that it blinds your vision.
[time=2915] It blinds your vision. It narrows your vision to a few causes you to lose sight of the many. I never have been able to figure out how people who are committed to discipleship can spend all their time with a few select people when they have friends and loved ones and relatives who need to know Christ and they never seem to see them. I know of one youth director in another church who committed himself to eight men. He met with them at six thirty every morning for prayer and Bible study and while he was the youth director of that church the pastor told me that eighty percent of the young people who went to that youth group when he came stop coming at one time did anyone ever go and find out where they were and why they weren't coming and they were hurting needy people and his philosophy was while I'm building into the lives of a few people.
[time=2963] I discover as I read about the Lord that he was never blind to the needs of the youngest or the poorest or the most sinful or the most distant or the most difficult his compassionate loving vision was just as broad as this wide world.
[time=2975] He always saw the masses.
[time=2979] Blinds your vision.
[time=2983] Last but not least folks I want you to hear me carried to its logical conclusion it buries evangelism. It buries it.
[time=2995] Do you know most of the time when you talk with guys about discipleship and I suppose I've had this diagram drawn on more napkins and restaurants than any other diagram I've ever seen. It is the multiplication table of what happens when you win one and he wins one and he wins one and you know ultimately in thirty-four years we win the whole world. That looks great. I get excited when I see that. But the problem is this here's what happens. Now listen carefully the one discipling takes someone who was one to Christ a few years before. It's usually somebody he likes somebody who fits the social academic picture of a disciple in his opinion somebody who's hungry to know the things of God and so he begins to spend time teaching him how to have a quiet time which is important how to memorize the scripture which is critical how to be submissive to authority how to have a sermon attitude all of those things are important he teaches those things.
[time=3051] Then the discipled person finds someone else already one to Christ and begins doing the same thing to him and the element of a strong aggressive evangelism is never introduced into the process.
[time=3063] Now folks if someone without a genuine burden for lost souls if someone without a desire to win people to Christ and get them down the aisle of a church and into the baptistry and into the teaching ministry of the church if someone not sold out to the work of the local church is discipling how in the world do you suppose the one being disciple is going to turn out.
[time=3087] It's going to be just like him.
[time=3091] The discipling one shows by his own example that all he does is spend time with the one being discipled he gets the idea that all he has to do is spend time with someone someone already won to Christ and if the discipler is not winning people how can we expect his learner to do it the bible says a disciple will never go beyond his teacher I don't intend to be harsh and I'm not trying to be cruel and critical
[time=3117] and I don't have anybody in mind at all but I want to tell you something if the one doing the discipling is a dud he won't produce a disciple he just produce another dud you're going to produce what you are and when I see people who are caught up in discipleship and talk all the language there's a cry in my heart I want to scream at them where are your people where are the people you have won to Christ when was the last time you took your disciple and took him out into a home and showed him how to lead someone to Christ true discipleship will always follow the pattern of the disciple Jesus Christ himself who everywhere he went in every way always was showing his disciples his love for the lost with the woman of Samaria with Nicodemus all through the gospels you see him and much of our discipleship today is nothing more than a glorified Bible study that is a convenient haven to give those who don't want to evangelize a sense of respectability and well-being I found an interesting thing in the New Testament folks and it's this that the discipleship relationship of persons to Christ in the gospels is always a teacher pupil relationship when you get to Ephesians Paul says it's the pastor teacher who equips the saints for the work of the ministry now listen carefully to this the word disciple in all of its forms is used 231 times in the gospels 30 times in the book of Acts I'll catch this but not one single time in the epistles not once this is far too significant to ignore you see the emphasis shifts from the relationship of the believer to Jesus Christ to the relationship of the believer to the church body now before you react at that let me explain Jesus Christ was body number one the physical body of Christ and in the gospels and in the book of Acts the relationship was the relationship of a disciple to Christ body number one when he went back to heaven he said there's another body it's body number two you know what that is that's the church we are the body of Christ and now the disciples relationship is to the body of Christ which is the local church I have always felt in my heart that much of what we're trying to do out there is available in here why do we have to have all of that out there when the whole church is structured for the nurturing and growth and development of new believers and we're developing something out there that's taking them away from what's in here and that's not scriptural and it's not biblical and I believe in the long run it will prove to be the curse of the growth of the body of Christ if we don't straighten it out men and women you can do anything you want to you can play all the games you want to play I've played them all but you cannot hide from this you are under orders from the master in heaven to communicate your faith to a lost world it is not an option don't tell me you don't have the gift it's not a matter of whether you have the gift you've got a command God Almighty has said to you go and when you're a world to Christ and if you're hiding in a discipleship group some place you won't have much to stand on when you stand before them at the judgment seat of Christ we have trained hundreds of people in this church to be evangelists and some of you have gotten off the path and you're off inside issues which may be important for your own personal growth but I wonder if it isn't a little bit like sending a letter to the starving Haitians telling them what a great meal we had last night shall we pray
[time=3365] Lord in heaven how easy it is for us to succumb to the strategy
[time=3371] of our adversary who gets us off the beaten path or how he delights to get us to do anything
[time=3377] but to tell others of our saving faith in Jesus Christ Lord we need to follow them up we need to develop them we need to teach them and cause them to grow you've been sharing the Bible hour with pastor David Jeremiah if as a result of this program you have made a decision about your relationship to Jesus Christ we would like to send you some material which will help you please write to us and indicate the nature of your decision earlier today pastor Jeremiah offered to send you his latest booklet entitled are we living in the last days to receive this helpful guide you may call toll free 1-800-453-9000 already hundreds of people have found this booklet
