[time=30] In the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana we present
[time=36] the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=40] "I am our who are, all you live are just away, then since I saw, my Savior got me, I'll break my heart, I'll break my heart, then since I saw, my Savior got me."
[time=69] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=89] We welcome you to our service today.
[time=91] This is a very special day in the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=95] We call it "senior day," and it's a day when we not only invite but provide transportation for many senior people to share with us in the ministry of the Word of God through the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and more particularly the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=113] And I haven't planned or rehearsed this, but I'd like to ask all of the senior people who are here today as our invited guests if you would please to stand up.
[time=121] Would you please stand? What a tremendous group. Let's give them a good hand, shall we?
[time=136] Thank you very much, and especially a very good group from the Grace Village in Winona Lake, Indiana who are making their third trip here for senior day, and after the service today, I'm going to share this with all of you.
[time=149] We're going to feed all of these folks in a big meal, and don't you try to crash the party? You have to have some credentials to get in if you're here as an invited senior citizen, you're welcome.
[time=160] And we're glad to have all of you, and we pray that the service today will really be a blessing to you.
[time=165] Now we want to listen to our choir as they sing for us, and they're led by one of the younger men on our staff who has senior citizen hair, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=175] They sing for us now.
[time=205] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=306] We are so happy to have the opportunity of the Bible Hour Television Ministry.
[time=312] One of our deacons, Mr. Dave Norton, who has been a friend of mine almost since the day I came to Fort Wayne,
[time=318] lost his mother just in the last few days, and after the service was over, David shared something with me that I've asked him to share with you.
[time=328] And he's going to do that before we hear some more music in just a moment, and then we're going to hear from the new disciples, and I'll introduce them in just a moment.
[time=335] Young people, you can just stand there and listen to what David has to share, and David, you come and tell us what's on your heart.
[time=342] Thank you, Pastor. I felt that it was important that you hear something. Maybe we take for granted sometimes the ministries that we have.
[time=352] And if you could hear some of the things that happened firsthand when we have to face opportunities to be a participant of a ministry, it might have a better impact on you.
[time=362] The Bible Hour specifically was something that prepared my parents for two areas in their lives.
[time=368] It prepared them first for the year by giving me an opportunity in December of 1977 to sit at a little table in our living room and share with my mom and dad the things that had happened to my family.
[time=380] And because of the Bible Hour, they then begin to think in terms of what do we need to do.
[time=386] On that one December night, my parents knelt around that table with my wife and I and prayed and asked Jesus Christ to come into their lives.
[time=393] And then that brought us to the second point because through the Bible Hour, it became an encouragement to my mom and my dad.
[time=400] And then my dad passed away two years ago for my mom in these last two years to have a certainty and a program for her life and anticipation of the hereafter, certainly to meet my dad.
[time=412] But I think even more important, she was ready to meet her Lord.
[time=416] And it was a very lonely time for my mom in terms of trying to adjust for my dad. They said Esther time heals all things.
[time=424] And she says that just isn't true. One of the things my mom did, my mom was active.
[time=429] I often felt that she better identified with my children than I did. She stayed young mentally.
[time=434] And I just want to share with you one other area that happened.
[time=439] It was a short time after my father's death that I think Pastor preached a sermon on what happens when Christians die.
[time=446] And that kind of nailed down for my mom what she knew for certain was going to take place in her life as she began to look forward to being with my father.
[time=454] And then as she began to develop the little daily disciplines in her life that she needed to have to keep herself straight, thinking young, what she needed to do to prepare herself for the life here after.
[time=466] And what I wanted to encourage you to do is don't take for granted the ministries that go on in this church, the Bible Hour.
[time=474] We tend to do two things. One, we tend to wait until it's too close or we tend to wait until it's too late.
[time=482] And I'm grateful that neither one of those things happen at least with my parents.
[time=486] I told Pastor he's dug a well now that I'll be fishing out of for some time because I had an aunt and an uncle who came away from the funeral service that he preached for my mother.
[time=497] And he said, "Now that's the second time he's gotten to me and I'm worried about it." And I said, "Well, Uncle Adrian, there's something you can do about it." And he says, "I know, but I'm not ready." And he lives in Chicago and he'll be able to see the messages and hopefully he'll be able to respond as did my mom in the closing days of her life.
[time=515] Don't take our Bible Hour for granted.
[time=517] And I don't want us to take our ministries for granted.
[time=520] And I just wanted you to know from someone that it's ministered to to hear that first hand.
[time=524] Thank you.
[time=525] Thank you, David.
[time=529] And of course, I asked David to share that because we're right now involved in a very special time of encouraging all of the Bible Hour family to be involved in this special project of making sure that the Bible Hour is financially well during these days.
[time=544] And I hope that many of you who are watching as well as all of you who are present, if you haven't participated in the special Bible Hour project that we've been talking about, you'll have an opportunity to do that, that you'll want to make an investment for eternity.
[time=558] As David shared with me, his two parents are in heaven today in some measure because many people invested in this ministry and the Word of God was sown into their hearts and lives and they could come to know Christ.
[time=570] It's a great investment to make and God honors it because it honors his Word.
[time=574] Now we're so happy today to have the new disciples and they've been standing out here ready for all this time and they ought to just be ready to bless your hearts.
[time=580] They're from the Moody Bible Institute, and they have something to share with us musically that I know you will appreciate the new disciples.
[time=610] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=732] We're so appreciative of your joining us today on the Bible Hour and normally during this time we take a few moments to share with you some items of literature and a brief report on the Bible Hour Ministry as it affects you.
[time=749] But today we want to talk about something that is very important to the both of us.
[time=754] As most of you know, we'll be leaving in just a few weeks to move to San Diego and our part in the Bible Hour Ministry will conclude.
[time=762] Someone else will be coming to minister to you, but we have something that's very heavy upon our hearts as we conclude our ministry as a part of the Bible Hour team.
[time=771] And I don't think there's anything that we have ever done that has been more important to us than that which we have undertaken to do during these days.
[time=780] You see, the Bible Hour over the years has incurred an indebtedness that is a part of its beginning ministry.
[time=788] We have handled it and struggled with it and carried it over these months, but we have committed before God our deepest desire to see that indebtedness eliminated before we leave.
[time=799] A few days ago, I sent many of you a letter telling you just how important this project is to us and to the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=810] More than anything else, we want to leave here with the Bible Hour Ministry completely out of debt so that the man that comes in to take over can start with a fresh slate and really go ahead and make future plans for the Bible Hour Ministry to expand and to proclaim the Word of God in an ever-increasing circumference.
[time=828] And that's why we have shared with you in recent days the need that we are now facing.
[time=833] And we have already received so many special letters just yesterday.
[time=838] We got a letter in the mail from a nursing home.
[time=841] And a man wrote the letter in behalf of three ladies who were in the nursing home who were unable to write themselves, but they asked if he would write the letters for them, and then they included a small gift that they were able to give to the Bible Hour.
[time=857] And I thought as we received that, if these people could sacrifice when they really didn't have it to give, how much that should encourage those who really can give to give a substantial gift.
[time=870] That's right Donna, if people gave proportionately to their ability and they followed the example of those three people, we would not only eliminate the Bible Hour indebtedness, but we would stock up enough money to get started with the new minister in the days ahead
[time=886] with a great deal of freedom.
[time=888] I got a letter this week from one of our dear supporters who mentioned that she so appreciated the picture that we had sent to her.
[time=896] And she sent along a very gracious gift.
[time=898] She's been a very, very faithful supporter.
[time=900] Her name is Mary Anderson.
[time=902] And what I thought was so neat was that she sent along a picture of her family, a picture of the folks that are close to her.
[time=908] And I think that tells the story of the close relationship that we've developed with people through the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=915] We were so blessed to get that picture.
[time=917] It made us feel like we were a part of the family.
[time=919] And I guess indeed we are.
[time=921] The Bible Hour is a family.
[time=923] And we want to see that family continue to be strong in the days ahead.
[time=927] So I want to encourage you, if you haven't already sent a gift to help in this special project, why don't you sit down today and write us a letter.
[time=936] In close a check for the largest amount you can, make it a sacrificial gift.
[time=941] There's no way anyone can construe this gift to be for us.
[time=945] We will not have one dime of this money for ourselves.
[time=948] It all goes to the Bible Hour Ministry and it will assure a continuation of this ministry in the days ahead.
[time=955] We hope that you'll get involved in the project and help us as we try to do this last great thing together for the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=963] And when you're writing, if you haven't already received this special booklet that we have written in preparation for all of you, I hope you will ask for it.
[time=972] This book contains two messages that I preached recently on the End Times.
[time=977] Included in the book is a message on the subject are we living in the last days, and then also another message on the subject of the Battle of Armageddon.
[time=986] If you're interested in prophecy as many of you are, you will enjoy these two special messages, and it will be the last time I'll be able to offer you something special like this that we have written.
[time=997] It comes in a beautiful four-color covered book, and you'll find it helpful and interesting as you study the Bible and you study today's times.
[time=1004] Before we go back to the service, we do have one associate sponsor that Donna wants to mention, and so we'll let her do that before we say goodbye for this little segment.
[time=1013] Our associate sponsor for today is Lula Brown, and we thank you Lula for your part in the ministry today, and we also need to share our mailing address with the folks at home.
[time=1024] If you would like to have this booklet, which Dave has just shared with you, and you would like to make a contribution to the Bible Hour Ministry, our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 8.5.
[time=1041] Donna, I want to share with our folks once more how very important it is.
[time=1045] It would be so great if we could hear from all of you. Many of you who have not even written to us, we may not have ever written to you since we haven't heard from you before, but we would like to hear from you.
[time=1054] And this is one way that you can say thank you for the ministry that the Bible Hour has had in your home, and in the lives of your loved ones during these past years.
[time=1062] I hope you'll write to us this week. We'll look forward to receiving your letter.
[time=1066] Simply address it to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1072] Now some more music from the new disciples, and then a message for today's special senior day on how to grow old gracefully.
[time=1080] I hope you'll stay with us as we share the word of God.
[time=1096] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=1240] And that is true, isn't it?
[time=1242] People all over the world need to know Jesus.
[time=1244] That's one of the reasons why Moody Bible Institute has been used in such a wonderful way for God and for His work.
[time=1251] I don't know how you would ever compute the effectiveness of that institute in these past years.
[time=1258] Missionaries and preachers and Christian workers all over this globe as the result of the effective training program with the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=1267] I wholeheartedly recommend that school to young people everywhere as a place where they can be trained to effectively serve God in many, many fields of endeavor.
[time=1276] We're thankful that some of our young people are there studying.
[time=1279] We have some graduates of the Moody Bible Institute and we thank God for everything they're doing.
[time=1284] They're good President Dr. George Sweeting who is a good friend of ours and we just pray for Moody Bible Institute and thank God for the privilege of this representation of that school here in our church.
[time=1294] Young people if you are here looking for a good school and you want to talk to some of these kids from the new disciples, they'd be more than happy to give you a bird's eye view of the Bible Institute program that could be very helpful to you.
[time=1308] Now just before the message the new disciples are going to sing for us again and for all of you in this area they will be with us tonight for our evening service and so you'll have an additional opportunity to share in their ministry.
[time=1319] Now the new disciples.
[time=1324] Teach me to step and listen.
[time=1332] Teach me to center down.
[time=1337] Teach me the use of silence.
[time=1342] Teach me where peace is bound.
[time=1348] Teach me to hear your calling.
[time=1353] Teach me to search your word.
[time=1358] Teach me to hear in silence.
[time=1363] Things I have never heard.
[time=1373] Teach me to be collected.
[time=1378] Teach me to be in tune.
[time=1383] Teach me to be directed.
[time=1390] Teach me to be understood.
[time=1399] Then when it's time for moving.
[time=1404] To every day and moment.
[time=1419] Teach me to be collected.
[time=1425] Teach me to be in tune.
[time=1430] Teach me to be directed.
[time=1436] Silence will end so soon.
[time=1442] Then when it's time for moving.
[time=1455] To every day and moment.
[time=1488] To share musically and in your ministry to us we appreciate so much your fellowship and we thank God for your coming today.
[time=1497] This is senior day at Blackhawk and I have something special to share with all of our special friends by way of a message and I hope will be of help and encouragement to all of us as well.
[time=1508] Our text for this morning is in the book of Joshua in the Old Testament.
[time=1512] One of the most famous senior saints that the Word of God speaks about is found in the 14th chapter of the book of Joshua.
[time=1520] And the name of the individual of course is the man Caleb.
[time=1524] I want us to open our Bibles this morning to the 14th chapter of Joshua and I'd like to read beginning at the 6th verse.
[time=1531] Joshua chapter 14 and verse 6.
[time=1535] Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal and Caleb, the son of Jafuna, the kenazite, said unto him,
[time=1542] Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadysparnia.
[time=1550] 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Cadysparnia to spy out the land.
[time=1556] And I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
[time=1559] Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt.
[time=1564] But I wholly followed the Lord my God.
[time=1568] And Moses swore on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance
[time=1575] and thy childrens forever because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
[time=1580] And now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years,
[time=1586] even since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness.
[time=1592] And now lo I am this day four score and five years old.
[time=1596] And yet I am as strong this day as I was in the days that Moses sent me, as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in.
[time=1607] Now therefore give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day, for thou heardest in that day how the anachim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified.
[time=1618] If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said.
[time=1624] And Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jafuna hebron for an inheritance.
[time=1631] Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jafuna the Kennesite unto this day
[time=1637] because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.
[time=1643] Years ago a king in haste sentenced one of his subjects to death.
[time=1650] It was a sudden rage of wrath that caused him to do it.
[time=1655] And after he had passed the sentence he realized that it was a mistake.
[time=1660] He summoned the subject before his throne and he said, "In consideration of your faithful services to me, I have decided to permit you at least to select the manner in which you prefer to die."
[time=1674] The sentenced subject said, "Your honor, I select to die of old age." Who of us could blame him?
[time=1685] Of all of the ways to die, that is the most attractive.
[time=1688] And it is my prayer that if I do not see the Lord's return in my lifetime,
[time=1694] he allows me to die of old age.
[time=1698] I would certainly think that most of us would vote for that if we had the opportunity and yet it's an interesting thing to discover that even though we would choose that for ourselves, especially in younger years, as old age creeps on, sometimes we develop a very negative attitude toward it.
[time=1717] Folks, we ought to learn how to deal with it both as those who are involved in growing older and those who are a part of this culture of our country because statistics tell us that in the United States today there are 23 million people over the age of 65.
[time=1732] In fact, there are over 12,000 who are above the age of 100 alive and well in the United States today.
[time=1740] And medical science tells us that if they can ever find an answer to arteriosclerosis
[time=1746] that by the year 2000 there will be 150 million 65 years of old and older people living in the United States.
[time=1756] This has become so important a subculture that there are now groups that have developed to represent the older people.
[time=1764] For instance, in the United States there is a group called the National Council of Senior Citizens which boasts 3 million members.
[time=1772] There is a group called the American Association of Retired Persons that has 9 million members in the group.
[time=1779] There is even an elderly protest group called of all names the Gray Panthers.
[time=1786] And the Gray Panthers are headed up by a sprite 67 year old woman by the name of Margaret Kuhn
[time=1793] who definitely does not weave scatter rugs or play shuffleboard.
[time=1797] Margaret Kuhn and 5 of her chums who are retired church workers have formed a union to protest the abuses
[time=1806] against the older people in retirement homes and other places around our country.
[time=1811] In one of her writings Miss Kuhn writes, "Much of senility is not irreversible.
[time=1816] It is induced by despair and frustration.
[time=1819] Fixed retirement is dehumanizing.
[time=1822] It shows how stupid our society is in making scrap piles of the elderly.
[time=1827] We're not mellow sweet old people.
[time=1830] We've got time to effect change and nothing to lose on Gray power," she says.
[time=1837] And I sort of agree with her and think she's doing a good work to keep the elderly alive and well in all aspects.
[time=1846] There is even a science, as most of you know, called the science of geriatrics. It is the study of old age.
[time=1853] And it is a medical practice which is growing in popularity around our country as men and women specialize in research,
[time=1860] studying the infirmities and peculiar maladies of the elderly and seeking remedies for them.
[time=1868] All of us who are Christians certainly ought to have an interest.
[time=1874] In our responsibility and ministry, both two old people and as old people.
[time=1880] Older people suffer a kind of loneliness which is hard for us to understand that usually stems from two things.
[time=1887] First of all, they have lost many of their contemporaries and loved ones and they have missed their fellowship.
[time=1894] Secondly, as I have talked to older people, their loneliness stems from the fact that they have a growing sense of uselessness as an individual.
[time=1903] Many older people have come to say to me, "Pastor, I really don't know why I'm still alive in this world.
[time=1909] What is it that there is for me to do? What is my purpose of existence?" And it is with those questions in mind that I felt impressed today to share with you a message from the Word of God,
[time=1920] from the life of Caleb, on three secrets to growing old gracefully.
[time=1925] Now, you have to understand this man. He was Mr. Great Heart of the Old Testament.
[time=1930] And when this event which I have read from the book of Joshua took place, Caleb was 85 years young and he was growing in every respect of his life.
[time=1940] He illustrates for us two things.
[time=1943] Number one, he proves beyond any repudiation at all that it is possible to accomplish life's greatest achievement in what we would consider to be old age.
[time=1954] Secondly, he proves to us that it is never time to retire in the Lord's work.
[time=1960] Now, let's notice the three secrets to growing old gracefully from the life of Caleb.
[time=1966] First of all, we notice as we read this text that Caleb kept growing physically.
[time=1974] All you say, "Pastor, that's one area where I qualify already. One thing about me for sure is I've grown old, I've kept growing physically."
[time=1982] But that's not what I'm talking about.
[time=1985] The Scripture says in Joshua chapter 14 and verses 10 and 11 that he was four score and five years old, 85 years old.
[time=1994] And yet verse 11 says, "I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me, as my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in."
[time=2008] Caleb said, "I'm just as strong, physically, and just as able, physically, at the age of 85 as I was when I was 40 years of age, and I went in to spy out the land from Katie Sparnia."
[time=2022] Obviously, Caleb was committed to taking care of himself physically. He kept growing physically.
[time=2028] I was interested this week to read of Moses over in the 34th chapter of Deuteronomy and verse 7 where we read that when Moses was 120 years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
[time=2043] In fact, you can go through the Scripture and read about Abraham and many other patriarchs who kept strong, vigorous, exciting lives going until the very day they died.
[time=2054] It's interesting to me that most of the humor that is related to growing old relates to the physical part of us.
[time=2061] And of course, that may be the one thing that's so difficult for us to deal with.
[time=2065] I'm sure some of you have seen the list of things that help you to know if you're growing older.
[time=2070] Someone has written a number of checkpoints that you can examine.
[time=2074] You're growing older when everything hurts and what doesn't hurt doesn't work.
[time=2079] You're growing older when the gleam in your eyes is the sun hitting your bifocals.
[time=2085] You're growing old when your little black book contains only names that end in MD.
[time=2091] You're growing old when you get winded playing chess.
[time=2096] You're growing old when you join a health club, but you never go.
[time=2100] You're growing old when your mind makes contracts, your body can't meet, and my favorite of all,
[time=2108] you're growing old when your pacemaker makes the garage door go up when you watch a pretty girl go by.
[time=2116] I don't know why it is that we joke so much about the physical part of growing old,
[time=2125] but maybe it's to make us more easily adjusting, make it possible for us to more easily adjust to the fact
[time=2133] that things aren't exactly the same as we grow older physically.
[time=2137] And yet in this regard, the Bible teaches us that this man Caleb continued to be strong in his physical prowess even at the age of 85.
[time=2148] Men and women, I want to say something to you that one of the reasons why people grow old and give up is because back somewhere in midlife or earlier,
[time=2156] they already gave up.
[time=2158] They stopped taking care of their body, they stopped taking care of their physical being, and little by little they give up more and more and more.
[time=2166] Until when they're 65 or 70, it's very easy just to throw in the towel.
[time=2171] But I want to tell you something folks, you can have a long, vigorous, exciting life as a Christian, as an ambassador for Jesus Christ,
[time=2179] if you will follow the example of Caleb and keep your body strong doing everything you know how to do to make it strong with the wisdom and power that God has given you.
[time=2190] I was reading the other day in the Journal of Charles Wesley, John Wesley, that these two Methodist pioneers never quit in the ministry.
[time=2201] John Wesley wrote in his diary the following words at the age of 85.
[time=2206] He said, "I find some decay in my memory with regard to names and things lately past, but with regard to things that are 20, 40 or 60 years old, I do not feel any weakness.
[time=2219] Either in traveling or preaching, I am never weary.
[time=2223] To what cause can I impute this?" First of all, he said to the power of God, fitting me for the work to which I am called, and next to the prayers of his children.
[time=2233] But then he said, "I do not discount the following.
[time=2236] Number one, my constant exercise and change of air.
[time=2240] Number two, my never having lost a night's sleep sicker well on land or at sea since I was born.
[time=2246] Number three, my having slept at command, whether day or night.
[time=2251] Number four, my having risen, risen constantly at 4 a.m. for 60 years.
[time=2257] Number five, my constant preaching at 5 a.m. for above 50 years and number six, my having so little pain, sorrow or anxious care in life."
[time=2267] Do you know that John Wesley during his lifetime traveled over 250,000 miles for 40 years preaching 40,000 sermons?
[time=2282] He produced 400 books. He knew 10 languages.
[time=2287] When he was 83, he was so annoyed that he couldn't write more than 15 hours a day.
[time=2293] When he was 86, he was ashamed that he could not preach more than twice a day.
[time=2299] He complained in his diary that there was an increasing tendency at the age of 87 to lie in bed until 5 30 in the morning.
[time=2312] And he grew old as a strong, virile servant of God.
[time=2316] One of the things that excites me as I move about our community here is more and more.
[time=2320] It seems as the years have passed, I've seen older people out walking, riding bicycles, taking long walks along, even along the main arteries, the main highways.
[time=2331] I think it's a good sign because maybe we're growing up to realize that these bodies of ours are the temples of the Holy Spirit
[time=2338] and I cannot find one shred of evidence in the Word of God that says when I get to be 60, I quit taking care of my temple.
[time=2346] I want to say to you, older people, if you can't run, then walk, and if you can't walk, then shuffle.
[time=2353] But don't give in to your body's desires for ease.
[time=2358] I visited over at Grace Village in Winona Lake a few months ago and one of the dear ladies who lives there took me down to her apartment
[time=2369] and she showed me where she walks.
[time=2372] Now, if you've never been to Grace Village, you could run a 10,000 meter race and never go outdoors.
[time=2377] It's such a long place, all along hallways up and down.
[time=2380] And she and another lady meet at a certain time each morning and they walk the halls of that place from one end to the other just as fast as they can walk.
[time=2387] You know what I say? Right on.
[time=2389] That's what God intends us to do.
[time=2391] These bodies of ours ought not to be allowed to deteriorate just because we're getting older.
[time=2397] Most of it's in the attitude of our mind, not in our ability in our bodies.
[time=2403] In the church where I'm going in San Diego, there's a man on the staff by the name of Casey Poole.
[time=2409] He's a business manager and he's 60 years of age.
[time=2412] When I first met him, I was struck with how he looked to be so much younger than his years.
[time=2417] And talking with one of the other staff members, he told me that Mr. Poole runs the 10,000 meter race almost every week or every other week
[time=2424] and he runs 6.2 miles in 38 minutes.
[time=2429] Now, if you know anything about 10,000 meter running, you know that's flat out moving.
[time=2433] And you can be sure of one thing, I'm not entering any 10,000 meter races that he's in, not for a long time.
[time=2440] Mr. Poole is 60 years of age and he's the city champion in San Diego for 60 and over at the 10,000 meter pace
[time=2447] because he cared about his body and he stayed true.
[time=2450] Now, right now at this very moment, his wife is dying in a hospital.
[time=2454] She has cancer, she is extremely overweight, she has let herself go and he told me on the phone not too long ago if my wife could just have caught the vision of caring for her body that God gave me, we could have many, many years together in the future.
[time=2469] Caleb was strong, notice what it says, he was just as strong at 85 as he was as 40.
[time=2475] Now, that didn't just happen.
[time=2477] While he was out in the wilderness, he was fighting all of the same things that everybody else was fighting.
[time=2483] He went through all the same disappointments, there were many times when he could have given up.
[time=2487] Many times when he could have just said I'm going to throw in the towel.
[time=2490] Here he was at 40 years of age at the peak of his powers and all he had to show for what he could do for God was just to walk around in the wilderness.
[time=2498] From the age of 40 until he was past 80, he had many reasons every day just to quit, but he never did.
[time=2508] There came a time in his life when Moses died and it was time for God to choose a successor.
[time=2514] Caleb certainly was as every bit as qualified as Joshua and yet Moses picked Joshua.
[time=2523] And Caleb could have said, well, that's it. I've tried to keep myself well and strong to accept God's assignment when the time came.
[time=2530] And now here's my great opportunity and I get passed over.
[time=2533] I'm going to throw in the towel and just go home and sit and soak and sour and forget about it all.
[time=2538] But he didn't. He kept growing and he kept moving because in his heart and in his mind Caleb knew that someday God had something for him to do and he wanted to be ready when the opportunity came.
[time=2552] He kept growing physically. Now secondly, second secret is this, he kept growing mentally.
[time=2560] Notice what it says in verse 12, "Now therefore give me this mountain which the Lord spoke in that day.
[time=2571] For thou heardest in that day how the anachim were there and that the cities were great and fortified.
[time=2577] If so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said."
[time=2583] Caleb looked out over all of that land and he said, "Now I'm 85 years old and it's my turn to choose what I want to do for God and I'm going to pick the hardest assignment there is.
[time=2592] I want that mountain where the giants are." He was tough-minded. He continued to grow mentally and accept the challenges of his day.
[time=2604] Now I want to remind you of something folks. All of Caleb's contemporaries were dead. Every one of them except Joshua.
[time=2610] For the reason they were assigned to the desert was as punishment for their unbelief.
[time=2615] Only Joshua and Caleb survived the wilderness experience and so all of the other men who were taking on the assignments of possessing the land were younger men than Caleb.
[time=2626] In fact they were the next generation down from where he was. And yet here's Caleb one of two and he takes the toughest assignment there is.
[time=2637] Now I want to show you something interesting that I discovered this week. Notice back in chapter 13 in verse 1.
[time=2643] Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and yet there remaineth very much land to be possessed.
[time=2652] Why? Because the younger men weren't getting the job done. They had been assigned the opportunity to go out and possess the land but here Joshua was ready to die and the job still wasn't done.
[time=2663] Turn over near Bibles to chapter 17 in verse 12 and we'll read about one of the tribes that had been assigned to possess the land.
[time=2671] The tribe of Manasseh and we read in 1712 yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the Canaanites would dwell in the land.
[time=2682] Here were a group of young men had been given an assignment to go in and possess the land and drive out the inhabitants and the scripture said they couldn't do it.
[time=2689] And there's another passage in the book of Joshua where Joshua challenges those people and he says how long will you be slack, lazy to possess the land.
[time=2699] The problem was they weren't working at it. They'd been given an assignment to do and they were just loafing and the job wasn't getting done.
[time=2707] But turn in your Bibles to chapter 15 in verse 14 and listen to the report card that is given to Caleb.
[time=2714] After his assignment is accepted verse 14 says and Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anik.
[time=2724] Caleb took the assignment that was hardest where the giants were. Nobody else was volunteering for it. None of the younger men wanted it but Caleb said give me this mountain and he went in and accomplished the task that he had accepted.
[time=2738] Caleb was a tough minded man. He started believing God early in his life. Do you know that?
[time=2748] Back at Katie Sparnia when the majority went into the land and they came back out. They said the people that are there that dwell in the land, the cities are walled and very great.
[time=2757] The sons of Anik are there. They said their giants were not able to go up. They're stronger than we are. It's a land eaten up of the inhabitants said the majority report.
[time=2767] There we saw giants and we were in their own sight as grasshoppers. That was their report. Now listen to Caleb 40 years ago, 45 years earlier than the place where we are today.
[time=2779] Caleb came back with Joshua and the scripture says Caleb got up and he stilled the people and he said chapter 13 of Joshua let us go up at once and possess it.
[time=2789] We are well able to overcome. The land is an exceeding good land that floweth with milk and honey neither fear you the people of the land. They are bred for us, said Caleb.
[time=2801] Their defenses departed from them. The Lord is with us, fear them not.
[time=2807] Caleb was at 85 what he started to become at age 40. He was a tough minded, faith filled human being who looking at a challenge didn't see the obstacles but saw the opportunities.
[time=2821] And when he looked at that mountain filled with the enemy, Caleb said that's just exactly the challenge I need to keep the juices flowing in my being. I'll take it.
[time=2831] And he took it and he succeeded. He was a brave man among cowards. He was an assured man among skeptics.
[time=2843] You see growing old is not so much a matter of our activity as it is a matter of our attitude. We are basically in life the way we think.
[time=2853] And Caleb kept his thinking powers strong. He's like John Knox who was 84 years of age and they said that at that age he could preach just like he could when he was younger.
[time=2864] John Wesley conducting some of his greatest ministry well into his 80s. Benjamin Franklin serving his country when he was past 60, on and on and on.
[time=2874] I could list illustrations of men who refused to grow old mentally and stayed young even though their age was past 80.
[time=2882] Someone has said that you may be old at 40 and young at 80. But you are generally old at any age if the following things are true. Number one, if you feel old.
[time=2894] Number two, if you feel you have learned all there is to learn. Number three, if you find yourself saying oh I'm too old to do that.
[time=2904] Number four, if you feel tomorrow holds no promise for you. Number five, if you take no interest in the activities of youth. Number six, if you would rather talk than listen.
[time=2915] And number seven, if you long for the good old days feeling that they were the best. If those things are true no matter what age you are, you're old.
[time=2924] But Caleb kept himself young mentally accepting the challenges that God put in his way. And folks I want to tell you something, God's dimension of life is never bound to time.
[time=2938] It's not bound to age, has nothing to do with physical limitations.
[time=2944] God expects us to live out our lives to the fullest no matter what age we might be taking every challenge that's before us and accepting it is from God.
[time=2956] Secret number two is he kept growing mentally. I want you to notice thirdly, Caleb grew old gracefully and godly because he kept growing spiritually. Notice verse eight of Joshua chapter 14.
[time=2974] Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt notice but I wholly followed the Lord my God. Underline that in your Bible.
[time=2985] Caleb said I wholly followed the Lord my God. I didn't turn from the right to the left. I didn't try to adjust God's will to my age. I accepted God's will and I followed it 100%.
[time=3000] You say pastor that's Caleb's own word. How can we be sure he had an assessment that was accurate? Well just read in the next verse and you'll hear what Joshua had to say about him.
[time=3011] Verse nine said and Moses swore on that day saying or Moses said about him surely the land where on thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever.
[time=3021] Here's what Moses said. Why? Because thou hast holy followed the Lord my God. Well Caleb said he followed the Lord holy and Moses said he followed the Lord holy but there's even a higher opinion and I don't have time for us to look at it but I'll read it to you from numbers 14 verse 24. This is what it says.
[time=3040] But my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully. Will I bring into the land where unto he went and his seed shall possess it? That is the word of God.
[time=3056] Caleb said I followed the Lord holy. Moses said he followed the Lord holy and God said he followed the Lord holy.
[time=3064] And I have to believe as I understand that that one of the great spiritual dynamics in the life of Caleb was his deep walk with God and his absolute commitment to 100% obedience no matter what God told him to do and he never quit doing that till the day he died.
[time=3081] You say what fired Caleb up and kept him going all those years. Well there's an interesting thing in this passage of scripture that I don't want you to miss. Five times in chapter 14 Caleb refers to the promise that was given to him earlier in life.
[time=3096] I want you to see those with me. First of all in the sixth verse. Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua and Gilgal and Caleb the son of Jafuna the Kennesite said unto him here's the first one.
[time=3108] Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Katie Sparnia. How long ago had God said that?
[time=3117] Forty five years ago. Forty five years ago God made that promise to him. Notice the second one verse nine and Moses swore on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens forever.
[time=3135] Notice verse 10 is the third one and now behold the Lord has kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the Lord spoke this word unto Moses. There's the third reference.
[time=3146] Then notice the fourth one in verse 11 yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. There's number four. And number five now therefore give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day.
[time=3160] You cannot miss it. The thing that was uppermost in Caleb's mind and thought and heart was that forty five years before that day God had given him a promise and that promise had been the anchor that kept him going through the wilderness experience.
[time=3174] While all his contemporaries were dying off and they were burying them a dozen at a time Caleb kept focusing in on the promise of God that God had something for him in the future and that if he just would maintain his faith in God that he would realize it.
[time=3189] And I'm sure there were days in his life when he thought I wonder if the promise will ever be fulfilled. I wonder if I'll ever realize what I'm supposed to do with my life but he kept himself ready and when he was eighty five God said now.
[time=3203] And Caleb rose up to be a giant for God in his day. I wonder how much work for God does not get done because we quit on ourselves before God quits on us.
[time=3220] We throw in the towel when God still has a lot for us to do. Caleb kept growing spiritually and the Bible tells us that he drove out the enemies and the giants.
[time=3237] He entertained no divided loyalties. He believed God's promises and he kept going. I'm sure that's something of what Solomon meant when in the Book of Proverbs he wrote that the beauty of old age is the grey head and that the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness.
[time=3258] What singles out Caleb for the rest. The Proverbs say he walked in the way of righteousness. He followed his God holy.
[time=3266] Some time ago Dora Johnson wrote a poem that I think summarizes all that I've tried to say today and I hope it'll be the spirit of your heart as it is mine. I'm just forty.
[time=3279] I'm right now where Moses was in Katie Sparnia and I have to admit that just going through that time you think about a lot of things but I want to tell you something as I've studied for this message this week I've been praying God let me preach when I'm ninety.
[time=3293] If they have to prop me up in the pulpit let me be strong enough to preach when I'm ninety. If the Lord doesn't come back I want to be ready to be used of God and maybe the greatest days ahead for any of us are the days of the future.
[time=3305] That's what Dora Johnson meant when she wrote these words she said you tell me I'm getting old. I'll tell you that's not so.
[time=3312] The house I live in well it's worn out and that of course I know. It's been in use a long long while it's weathered many a gale. I'm really not surprised you think I'm getting somewhat frail.
[time=3325] The colors changing on the roof the windows are getting dim the walls are a bit transparent and looking rather thin.
[time=3336] The foundation's not so steady as once it used to be yeah I know the house is getting shaky but my house isn't me.
[time=3346] My few short years can't make me old I feel I'm in my youth eternity lies just ahead a life of joy and truth.
[time=3357] I'm going to live forever there life will go on it's grand you tell me I'm getting old you just don't understand.
[time=3368] The dweller in my little house is young and bright and gay just starting on a life to last throughout eternal day.
[time=3378] You only see the outside which is all that most folks see you tell me I'm getting old because you've mixed my house with me.
[time=3392] That's it isn't it the house can get old but you don't have to keep growing physically and spiritually and mentally God has a job for you to do amen amen.
[time=3405] Father I pray that you'll let me preach when I'm ninety and that you'll help me to understand that I can keep growing and going for God.
[time=3414] If I'll follow the example of men like Caleb John Wesley others who've taken a page from the book of God to live it out in their lifetime.
[time=3425] I pray that the men and women who have listened to this message who are in that category we call senior citizenry will understand that God isn't finished with them yet.
[time=3436] When he's done with them he'll call them home but until he is he's got something for them to do and father help them to get up out of the easy chair.
