[time=30] The Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=35] We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=60] [MUSIC]
[time=69] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=74] We welcome you to this service. Thank you for being here today.
[time=77] Those of you who have gathered here in the auditorium are participating, as you know, in the second worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=85] And then we have been encouragingly invited all of you who are sharing by television to participate in our morning worship.
[time=93] We're thankful for your presence, and we trust this hour will be a blessing and encouragement to each and every one of you.
[time=99] We usually begin our service with a praise anthem from our choir.
[time=103] The choir is under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger, and they sing for us right now.
[time=108] [MUSIC - 179 seconds]
[time=316] Thank you, Choir, for your ministry to us.
[time=319] We have always appreciated the ministry of Keith Brodigum.
[time=323] He sang for us at our summer Bible conference last Thursday, a beautiful song about the sovereignty of God.
[time=329] Our God is in control. Keith is going to sing that for all of us today.
[time=334] I know you'll appreciate his ministry as he shares with us now.
[time=338] [MUSIC - 236 seconds]
[time=590] Thank you, Keith.
[time=592] Periodically, in this part of our service, we have entertained pulpit guests in the past, some of them from outside of the church from this area, and we're so happy today to have, as our pulpit guests, Bob and Virginia Veneta.
[time=605] And they are members of our church, some of you remember, will understand and respond to Bob Veneta
[time=612] because he's been a part of the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=614] Bob and Virginia just returned from a tour of a very special nature.
[time=620] Bob, why don't you share with these folks how you got into that and what it was?
[time=624] Well, the name of the group pastor was Sounds of Hope, and the purpose of this group was to tour Europe.
[time=630] We were in eight countries, and just try to spread goodwill between we Americans on the tour
[time=637] and the Europeans that we came in contact with as we sang and as we stayed in their homes.
[time=642] How many countries did you visit?
[time=644] We visited eight countries, we gave 19 concerts, and just met a lot of tremendous people.
[time=651] Now, Virginia, you went along, not as a musician, but what did you do?
[time=655] I went as the tour nurse.
[time=657] And in the process lost her voice. She has learned jitis, and you won't hear any more from her for the rest of his interview.
[time=664] But I just wanted her to say that so you'd know she could talk normally.
[time=668] Bob, when you decided to do this, you shared with me, and I remember I wrote a letter to a recommendation for you.
[time=674] It was so excited about the opportunity, and I knew you would have some experiences you would never forget.
[time=680] You were sharing just a brief bit about your experience at the Iron Curtain.
[time=684] Maybe you could recap that for us.
[time=686] Well, we had the opportunity to visit the Iron Curtain one morning, and it was a very grey, cold, windy morning, which added, I think, to the atmosphere.
[time=695] And every 400 yards along the Iron Curtain, right on the eastern side, are concrete towers about 100 feet high.
[time=706] And in these towers, we were told, we're three East German soldiers with guns that go bang, bang, bang, as the man said.
[time=714] And I was very curious about that, and I took a pair of binoculars and focused in on the bottom of the tower.
[time=720] And as I moved up the tower, I wanted to get to the top to the actual observation point.
[time=725] To see whether I could see the men actually in there.
[time=728] And as I came to the top, I focused in on another set of binoculars, looking right exactly at me.
[time=735] It was at that point that I realized, hey, this thing is really real.
[time=739] And these people in East Germany are in bondage, and they can't get out.
[time=743] You were telling me earlier about a very special kind of service that you held at the Iron Curtain that really must have been a very emotional time?
[time=752] Yes, it was.
[time=753] A little later in the day, the whole group had an opportunity to come back to the Iron Curtain.
[time=758] As we stood there, by this bondage, and we joined hands and we sang our theme song, "A Sounds of Hope," and some of the words are,
[time=768] "What will tomorrow be? Will there be freedom for you and me? Let it begin with me."
[time=774] And we raised our hands in celebration of the freedom that we enjoy in the United States, and I looked across this border,
[time=780] and I thought of those people who were there forever and ever without freedom.
[time=784] I couldn't help but have a tear come to my eye.
[time=787] Do you think, Bob, that you had an opportunity to change the opinion that has been generated by the ugly American syndrome across the countries that you visited?
[time=795] Well, I'm sure that we have one of the, well, several of the families that we stayed with.
[time=800] We were the first Americans to ever be in their homes.
[time=803] They opened their heart and their house to us, and one of the boys stayed with a family in England,
[time=810] and when he got there, they said, "We don't like Americans. We really didn't want you.
[time=815] The neighbors were to keep you," and they were called out of town on an emergency, so you're here with us.
[time=820] A couple days later, he discovered that he had left his pants at their house. He had more than one pair of his pants.
[time=828] He called back to this family and asked if they would send the pants to him, and a couple days later, he received these,
[time=836] and inside the package was a letter, and it said, "We are very glad that you stayed with us.
[time=841] You changed our opinion about Americans. We loved you." So that's only one family, but that's where we start.
[time=848] Christian Americans traveling abroad can have a great impact like that, even for our national good.
[time=853] I know you're not supposed to say anything else, but, Virginia, what was it like when you flew back into the United States?
[time=858] It was very exciting. When we broke into God bless America and the National Anthem and the remembrance of the Iron Curtain, it was really contrasting.
[time=867] It's great to be an American. Yes, it is.
[time=870] Especially a Christian American. That's right. Bob, thank you for sharing with us. We want you to know we appreciate taking the time to do that.
[time=876] Thank you very much.
[time=878] Well, we're happy to have you with us today. The sets on these recent programs have been a little crowded.
[time=889] We've added a few people here during these last few weeks, and we'll be in the next few weeks as we try to introduce you to some of the other people
[time=896] who are part of the Bible, our ministry, and get you acquainted with them.
[time=899] We're going to do that today in just a moment, but this is a familiar face, my wife Donna.
[time=904] Honey, why don't you tell them about our book offer that we're sharing during this time?
[time=908] Would you do that?
[time=909] I'm glad to.
[time=910] With the recent events in the Middle East, there seems to be a renewed interest in prophecy.
[time=916] Not too long ago, my husband preached a couple of messages on prophecy.
[time=921] The sermons were entitled, "Are We Living in the Last Days?" And also, "The Battle of Armageddon." And we've had so many requests for copies of those messages that we decided to put it in print form.
[time=933] And we'd be more than happy to send you a free copy of this booklet.
[time=937] And all you need to do is just write to us and write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 8, 1, 5.
[time=946] And we'll be glad to send you a copy, and perhaps if you would like to share a copy with a friend, you can ask for two, and we'd be glad to send you those also.
[time=955] And one of the prophetic themes is being carried out of today's program, as I'm going to be speaking in just a few moments on the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=963] And everywhere I go, people are talking about the fact that these may be the last days, and what does the Bible have to say about it.
[time=969] So we hope you'll write and get this book, and we'll be happy to send it to you and encourage you with its truth.
[time=974] Now, we're also expecting to hear from many more of you in these days, while we're in the midst of the special fun drive that we have organized,
[time=983] to make sure that as we leave this ministry in a few days for the West Coast, that the Bible Hour television program is financially secure.
[time=991] More than anything that we've ever attempted to do, we are really trusting God to make sure that all of the funds that are needed to totally eliminate the Bible Hour's indebtedness will be received through the mail in these next days.
[time=1004] We've heard from so many of you, and we thank you for helping us during this time.
[time=1009] We're not only excited about the gifts that you've sent, but your letters have been so very precious to us.
[time=1014] I think Don and I have read more letters in recent days than ever before in any time in our lives, and each one of them has been very special.
[time=1021] We thank you for what you've done, and we hope you will continue to respond.
[time=1025] And if you haven't sent your gift, we'll sit down today and write a check to the Bible Hour for the largest amount you can possibly give and send it to us,
[time=1034] so that we can reach this goal of total elimination of our indebtedness by the time we leave here in just a few days.
[time=1042] Donna, we have heard from some really neat people, haven't we?
[time=1045] We certainly have, and one of the special things that's happened is in response to our sending our picture out to them,
[time=1052] a number of people have sent back to us a picture of themselves, and that's really been delightful because we have no way of seeing you.
[time=1059] You have an advantage over us and that you can see us every week, but we never get an opportunity to view you.
[time=1064] And we'd like to just share a few pictures that we have received in the mail during these recent days.
[time=1070] Our first one is of David Jones Riker. He is in the wheelchair.
[time=1075] We had the privilege of meeting David several months ago when we were having our TV rallies, and he's a real special person.
[time=1083] Our next picture is of Catherine Giorgio, and we thank her for sending her picture to us.
[time=1090] And our last one is of Melvin and Naomi Yates.
[time=1094] And these are really dear people, and we thank you for taking time out to send us your picture so that we can have an opportunity to become more intimately involved in your lives.
[time=1105] It really has been neat to meet all of these folks, and we hope that many of you who have yet to write will write to us this week
[time=1111] and be a part of this great project that we've organized for the sake of the Bible, our testimony and its ministry here.
[time=1117] Once again, when you write right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=1125] Now, our special guest today in our living room said is Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=1129] Don, as you know, is the minister of music, and someone said recently you probably know him for his famous lines.
[time=1137] Thank you, and you may be seated, which he usually says at the end of our congregational singing.
[time=1142] Don, you are not only a minister of music, but you're actually an ordained pastor, too, aren't you?
[time=1147] Yes, I am. I was ordained when I was 21 years old.
[time=1151] And for many years did not have local church ministry, but we're out in another kind of ministry.
[time=1157] My brother Dick and I traveled in evangelistic work for nine and a half years, and we concentrated our ministry in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.
[time=1166] And frequently got out to Chicago and Indiana, too.
[time=1170] You know, Don, in the years that we've been on television and shared this ministry together, because we both have gray hair, we have been confused for each other.
[time=1178] Did you know that?
[time=1179] Well, I have been confused on the telephone with you. My voice, I wasn't ever confused by looking like you because you're so much better looking than I am.
[time=1189] Oh, wonderful, wonderful. We should have had you on here earlier.
[time=1192] One of the things that happened to me, I don't know if I ever told you this, was after one of our musicals.
[time=1197] Dear Lady came up and congratulated me on the wonderful way I had conducted the choir, which blew me away, because I couldn't wave my hand in the right direction if my life depended on it.
[time=1207] And I just hope you don't ever get blamed for any of my sermons.
[time=1210] I have been, but it was always the good one, so I appreciate that, too.
[time=1213] I'm glad for that. Don, you're going to be having a part on the Bible Hour Insert, which is what we call this time in the days ahead.
[time=1222] You're going to be sharing some of the things that we have been talking about, and I think that's going to be an exciting thing for our friends in the Bible Hour to get to know you better.
[time=1231] What are some of the things you're going to be talking about?
[time=1233] Well, I'm very excited about the Bible Hour since I've come to Fort Wayne, and we've been here about three years.
[time=1238] Now we're going to enter our fourth year, the end of this month. I've been just very excited about the ministry of the Bible Hour because of all the testimonies of people who have come to know the Lord as a result of it.
[time=1250] And so to have an expanded ministry of sharing with you folk in the Bible Hour congregation is just going to be a real joy and thrill for me in these next few months.
[time=1259] Well, we're excited that you're willing and able to move into this time and fulfill this opportunity, and we pray that God will use you and Rick who will be sharing with you to encourage the people at home.
[time=1270] And I know that you will make many friends as we have made, and Donna, we have made many friends, haven't we?
[time=1276] Certainly have.
[time=1277] And it's very exciting to think about the fact that someone has been provided to continue to meet their needs during this interim time.
[time=1284] Before we go back to our service, I want to remind you again that the free book on prophecy is yours today.
[time=1289] If you will just write to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=1296] We have a limited number of these books, and when they're gone, we won't be able to make them available to anyone again.
[time=1303] And this is the last book that I have written that will be available to you, and I hope you'll write and get your copy today.
[time=1309] Now it's time to go back to our morning service, and we trust you'll stay with us as we open the Word of God and share together another prophetic thing on the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1332] Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[time=1345] All the nations of the earth will come and worship before thee, for thou has created all things.
[time=1361] And we lift our hearts before you, as a token of our love.
[time=1370] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1379] Gracious Father, Gracious Father.
[time=1388] We're so blessed to be your children, Gracious Father.
[time=1397] And we lift our hearts before you, as a token of our love.
[time=1406] Gracious Father, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=1433] And we lift our hearts before you, as a token of our love.
[time=1441] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=1451] Holy, holy, holy.
[time=1460] All the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns, around the glass we see.
[time=1486] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=1516] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.
[time=1533] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1573] Thank you, Stephen Maria, for sharing with us musically.
[time=1578] Just before the message this morning, we're going to hear from star in our wall.
[time=1582] And she is singing one of my favorite hymns, hymns that's based upon scripture in the Old Testament book of Lamentations.
[time=1590] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1602] Oh God, my Father, there is no shadow of turning with thee.
[time=1618] Thou changest not thy compassion, they fail not, as thou hast been, thou forever shall be.
[time=1636] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1648] Oh thy have neither thy hand hath provided.
[time=1661] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=1673] Lord, and for sin, and a peace that indoreth.
[time=1682] I own dear presence to cheer and to cry.
[time=1690] Strain for today, and write home for tomorrow.
[time=1699] Blessings of mine with ten thousand beside.
[time=1710] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1718] Warning thy morning, new mercies thy seed.
[time=1727] Oh thy have neither thy hands hath provided.
[time=1738] Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=1762] Thank you, Star.
[time=1767] God is in control, great is thy faithfulness, and our worship to the Lord in the song that
[time=1774] Stephen Maria sang, provide a very good basis for us to open the scriptures together today
[time=1780] to 2 Corinthians chapter 5, 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=1787] I'm reading as our scripture lesson verses 1 through 10, 2 Corinthians 5, 1 through 10.
[time=1796] Follow in your Bibles as I read from mine.
[time=1799] For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.
[time=1808] For in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven.
[time=1813] If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[time=1817] For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
[time=1827] Now he that hath wrought us for the very same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
[time=1833] Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight.
[time=1844] We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.
[time=1850] Wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
[time=1856] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
[time=1869] Twice in the New Testament scriptures, we see the phrase the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1876] It is a very interesting subject and has many people confused these days.
[time=1883] What is the judgment seat of Christ?
[time=1886] The first thing I think we need to note from the text we have read is that it is an event
[time=1892] that will be participated in by Christian people.
[time=1896] It is easy to trace that through in the argument of 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=1900] For the first verse we learned to whom Paul is speaking.
[time=1904] He says in verse 1, "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle would dissolve, we have a building of God." Now obviously the people to whom Paul is speaking are Christian people.
[time=1917] People who have a tabernacle with God, people who have a body to look forward to some day
[time=1923] when these bodies have been taken from us and put into the grave some day in the resurrection
[time=1929] we're going to have new bodies.
[time=1931] Obviously that's truth for Christians alone.
[time=1934] But trace down through your Bibles to verses 9 and 10 and notice that there is no change in person.
[time=1940] For when we get to verse 9 we read, "Wherefore we." And the we of verse 9 is the same group of people as Paul is addressing in verse 1 of the fifth chapter.
[time=1952] And he says in verse 9, "We labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
[time=1958] Now notice, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ."
[time=1964] The judgment seat of Christ, which is our topic for discussion today, is an event for Christians.
[time=1972] It is an event which you and I will participate in.
[time=1976] Whether you are young in the Lord or old in the Lord, no matter what denomination you may belong to,
[time=1982] if you know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, the Bible says you will be present at the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1988] It says, "We must all." It is an inclusive term and it means every single Christian of every generation
[time=1996] since the cross and the day of Pentecost, all of us will appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2003] There will be no one who escapes it.
[time=2005] There will be no one who goes around it.
[time=2007] Everyone will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2010] Now the Bible teaches that. It is very clear about the presence of Christians before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2018] Why then is there so much confusion?
[time=2020] Well, there are three false ideas about the judgment seat of Christ that have confused believers from the very beginning.
[time=2028] First of all, there are some who teach that the judgment seat of Christ is a judgment that happens when we die
[time=2034] to determine whether or not we get into heaven. It is a judgment that determines our place in eternity.
[time=2042] And obviously, if you know the Scripture, you know that isn't true.
[time=2045] In the Bible, we are told that the Christians experience three judgments in their life.
[time=2051] First of all, there is the past judgment of the sinner.
[time=2055] We read in John 524, these words, "He that hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life
[time=2064] and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life."
[time=2070] When did the condemnation of the sinner take place?
[time=2073] Well, I mean in women, it took place on the cross.
[time=2075] When Jesus died on the cross, the Christians' judgment took place when his sin was judged as Christ bore our sin in his body on the tree.
[time=2084] That's why in writing to the Romans, he could say, there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[time=2092] Why is there no condemnation?
[time=2094] Because simply put, that condemnation was meted out upon Jesus Christ when he died.
[time=2099] And as Christians, in the past, we were judged at the cross.
[time=2104] But the Bible also teaches that as Christians, we are not only sinners, but now as Christians, we are sons.
[time=2111] And there is a judgment in the present for those who are sons.
[time=2115] If we had time today, we would turn to Hebrews, chapter 12, where we are told, that just like earthly fathers chastise their sons,
[time=2124] so our heavenly father chastises us as his sons, and through that chastisement, through that judgment which God brings upon us in our Christian walk,
[time=2134] we are made like unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and we are purified in our life.
[time=2139] Just as in the past, there was a judgment for us as sinners.
[time=2143] Men and women, there is in the present a judgment for us as sons.
[time=2147] And that's why Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, in 1 Corinthians 11, 30, said to all the Christians that they should be sure to judge themselves that they be not judged.
[time=2158] What did he mean?
[time=2159] He meant simply, as you examine your own life as a Christian, make sure that you take care of your own problems by keeping a short account with God.
[time=2167] You judge sin in your own life, and if you do that, God won't have to judge it for you.
[time=2172] There are Christians today whose sin has been judged at the cross who are right now under the judgment of God in their Christian experience because they are not walking in fellowship with the Lord.
[time=2182] The chastisement of God is the present judgment of the Christian.
[time=2187] But the Bible also teaches that there is a future judgment of the Christian.
[time=2191] It is not the judgment of the sinner, it is not the judgment of the son, but it is the judgment of the servant.
[time=2197] And that's what we have read about in 2 Corinthians 5, where we are told that all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2206] To receive the things done in the body, whether they be good or evil.
[time=2211] So it is not true to say that when we stand before God at the judgment seat of Christ, it will determine whether we get into heaven.
[time=2218] We will never be before the judgment seat of Christ unless that matter is already settled a long time ago.
[time=2224] There will be no unsaved people at the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2227] The only people who will stand there are those who have already committed their lives to Christ.
[time=2232] Now there is a second irony as a review of the judgment seat of Christ that goes like this.
[time=2238] Some people believe that the judgment seat of Christ is a judgment to punish believers for all of the sins which they committed
[time=2247] since they were saved. I have had people explain it to me this way.
[time=2251] Pastor, I understand about how Christ forgave our sin.
[time=2254] When he died on the cross, he forgave all of my sin that I committed up until the time I was saved.
[time=2259] So when I asked Christ to commit to my life, all of those sins in the past were forgiven.
[time=2263] But now that I am a Christian, I am on God's divine maintenance program.
[time=2267] And from this point on, I have to take care of my own sin.
[time=2270] And whatever sins I commit from the moment I am saved until I stand before Christ, I will have to give an account for.
[time=2276] Now there is only one thing wrong with that.
[time=2278] And that is that the Bible teaches us that when Christ died on the cross, he forgave all of our sins.
[time=2283] And he put them behind his back. He buried them in the deepest sea. He blotted them out.
[time=2289] He says that we will not ever again face our iniquities.
[time=2294] I remember a lady came to me in the early days of my ministry here troubled because she had this concept of the judgment of Christ.
[time=2302] She believed that she was forgiven for everything she did before she was saved.
[time=2306] But now she was responsible every day for whatever she did.
[time=2309] And one day she'd answer for her sin at the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2312] She said, "I know that Christ forgave all my past sins. It's my future sins that really bother me."
[time=2318] Now remember saying to her what someone had said to me earlier in my life.
[time=2322] I said, "Ma'am, how many of your sins were yet future when Christ died on the cross?"
[time=2328] "How many of them when he died on the cross were still in the future?" She said, "Well, all of them." "Well, how many of your sins then do you think he died for? Did he die on the cross for the sins you'd committed in the past?"
[time=2340] "Well," she said, "I didn't have any sins. I wasn't even alive then. That's true." "So when he died for your sin, he died for all of your sin, and all of it at that point in time was in the future, right?"
[time=2350] She said, "Yes. Oh," she said, "I see it." "He paid the penalty for all of my sins, not just the sins I committed before I was saved, but every sin I would ever commit, any day I would ever live in my whole life."
[time=2363] "All of my sins he paid for at the cross." So the judgment seat of Christ is not God's divine maintenance program for Christians.
[time=2372] Well, then there's a third view that some folks have about the judgment seat of Christ, and that's this.
[time=2376] It's a little more sophisticated than the second, and it's like this.
[time=2380] Some people believe that the judgment seat of Christ is a judgment for believers to judge them for all of their unconfessed sin that was committed after they were saved.
[time=2390] And they describe it like this, "Well, I know that I'm forgiven, but if I don't confess my sin, then I'll not be forgiven.
[time=2396] And if I don't confess my sin, any unconfessed sin I'm going to face before God when I stand at the judgment seat of Christ."
[time=2403] Whenever I hear that argument, I like to try to help people understand the difference between positional theology and relational theology, and there is a vast difference.
[time=2413] I think it's the most important thing for a Christian to know in order to have peace in his own Christian experience.
[time=2419] Positional theology says this, "That when Christ died, He paid the full penalty for all of my sin. I am totally forgiven. In the eyes of God, as seen through Jesus Christ, I am a forgiven redeemed individual."
[time=2432] That is position.
[time=2434] Relational theology says this, "That as a forgiven person, I need to put into practice what is true in position.
[time=2442] By that I mean I need to function as a child of God and make sure that my relational maintenance with Christ is where it ought to be."
[time=2452] I've shared this illustration with some of you in the past, but it has always helped me to explain this to others.
[time=2457] When I was a teenage boy, I took my father's Chrysler Newport out on a backcountry road before I was of the age to drive.
[time=2465] Believe it or not, with my good driving skills, I turned it over.
[time=2470] In fact, it turned clear over and landed on its side.
[time=2475] Fortunately for me, it was out in a farm community and a farmer came by in his truck and he hooked up a chain and pulled it out.
[time=2482] That helped me get out of the ditch, but it didn't take care of the dent.
[time=2485] I had to drive that thing home, all smashed in on the side and pulled into the driveway.
[time=2490] When my dad came home from work that night, he just looked at it. He didn't say a word, walked into the house.
[time=2496] He didn't say a word all that day. He didn't say a word all the next day for three whole days.
[time=2501] There was no conversation between us in our house.
[time=2504] You can't imagine what meal time was like. It was awful.
[time=2508] Total lack of any relational fellowship.
[time=2512] I had so hurt him by violating the trust that he had put in me, that he was grieved with me,
[time=2519] and we couldn't talk back and forth.
[time=2521] Suddenly dawned on me that the problem was my fault and I better go get it settled.
[time=2525] I went and asked my father to forgive me and he gave me a hug and we reestablished the relationship with this minor judgment that I paid for the car anyway.
[time=2536] I've thought about that situation many times since it happened in this respect.
[time=2542] During that time, it may have entered my father's mind that it might be a good idea if he didn't have a son.
[time=2548] Maybe he would like to have traded me in for someone else.
[time=2552] But men and women noticed this.
[time=2554] Even though the relational part of our involvement with each other was marred and it was broken,
[time=2560] the positional part never changed. I was always his son.
[time=2564] I was always David Jeremiah, the son of Dr. James D. Jeremiah.
[time=2568] Nothing I did changed that because I was born into his family physically.
[time=2573] And even though I had marred our relationship by my sin, my position didn't change.
[time=2579] And it's very important for Christians to understand that when you're born into the family of God, that establishes your position.
[time=2586] But it is the day by day spiritual foot washing that establishes your relationship with Jesus Christ and your fellowship with him.
[time=2594] So it is not true to say that when you stand at the judgment seat of Christ, you will be judged for all of those things that have messed up your relationship with God.
[time=2602] Those things are all covered under the blood, too.
[time=2605] But if you want a fellowship with him, you better keep a clean account so that you can have the kind of oneness with your father
[time=2612] that I've described was absent in our home when I sinned against my dad.
[time=2617] What then is the judgment seat of Christ?
[time=2620] Well, I think we can gain a great deal of help by understanding the term that is used.
[time=2624] We won't know what it means when we say the beam of seat, but I want to tell you something, folks.
[time=2629] Every Greek to whom Paul wrote knew exactly what he was talking about when he said the beam of seat of Christ.
[time=2635] For outside of their cities were great Olympic stadiums where runners competed in the Olympic games.
[time=2641] And the beam of seat was the judges stand where the winners were given an award, where they were awarded for having competed properly.
[time=2650] The beam of seat then was a place where people were given a reward for their participation in the race and for having run the race in a proper way.
[time=2661] And when the Bible teaches us that we're going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the beam of seat of Christ,
[time=2668] it means that someday all of us who are Christians are going to be judged by the Lord Jesus Christ as he sits on the divine tribunal
[time=2676] and he sits on the divine beam of seat and hands out the rewards for those as Christians who have served him faithfully in this life.
[time=2685] And the Bible says that some will be given rewards and some will suffer the loss of rewards based upon how they have lived their personal lives as Christians.
[time=2695] Now, I think the best passage to teach that to us is in 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=2700] I wish we had time to develop the entire argument of this chapter, but we can't do it.
[time=2705] Let me give you a brief outline and apply this to what we're talking about today.
[time=2710] 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=2712] Now, in the first four verses we learn of some of the problems that were happening in the church at Corinth.
[time=2718] Paul is writing to them and he's saying, "I can't speak to you as spiritual people.
[time=2722] I have to speak unto you as fleshly as babes in Christ.
[time=2726] I fed you with milk and not with solid food because you can't bear solid food." And the reason is this.
[time=2732] You're carnal.
[time=2733] You're not living spiritually.
[time=2735] There are divisions among you and envying and strife and you walk as men.
[time=2740] One says, "I'm of a palace." Another says, "I'm of Paul. Are you not carnal?" Paul is saying that in this church the problem was that the brethren were functioning as babes.
[time=2751] They had divided up into little cliques and they weren't functioning as solid spiritual Christians,
[time=2757] but they had all kinds of church strife.
[time=2760] Men and women's strife in the church is not something we invented in the 20th century.
[time=2764] Strife in the church has been a part of it ever since it was born.
[time=2767] That's why Reinhold Nebor said one time recently that the church of Jesus Christ was like Noah's Ark.
[time=2773] If it weren't for the storm outside you couldn't stand the stench inside.
[time=2777] I think he had a great deal of truth when he said that.
[time=2781] And in the church to which Paul wrote he is saying that there was strife and division.
[time=2786] There were all kinds of problems.
[time=2788] Now notice the first part of the text talks about the problem.
[time=2791] The second part of the text talks about the people.
[time=2793] Notice verses five through nine.
[time=2795] Who then is Paul?
[time=2796] Who is a Paulus?
[time=2797] But they're ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.
[time=2801] I have planted a Paulus water, but God gave the increase.
[time=2804] So then neither is he that planth anything, neither is he that waterth, but God that giveth the increase.
[time=2811] Now he that planth and he that waterth are one.
[time=2814] Now get this.
[time=2815] And every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
[time=2821] Now listen carefully.
[time=2822] What about these men around whom they were forming their little clicks?
[time=2826] What about them?
[time=2827] What does the Bible say about them?
[time=2829] These sick saints are reminded that Paul and a Paulus and Cephas are ministers serving the Lord because they were raised up by the Lord.
[time=2839] These men recognized that they were nothing more than instruments through whom the Lord does his work.
[time=2844] Paul planted the seed, a Paulus watered the seed, but the seed was not in himself.
[time=2849] Neither the planter nor the water is important.
[time=2853] Each has his own responsibility and everyone makes his own contribution and God gives the increase.
[time=2860] When each servant of the Lord recognizes this principle and lives by it, he will understand the basis of the Bhimasit judgment.
[time=2868] For there is coming a day when every Christian will stand before the throne of the Bhimasit of Christ and give an account for the things done in his flesh.
[time=2877] And the Bible says every man shall receive his reward according to his labor.
[time=2883] Some day when we stand before Christ we are going to be examined as to what we have done with the tools that Christ has put into our hands as Christians how we have labored for God.
[time=2894] Now notice thirdly not only the problem but the people.
[time=2897] When we get into the next part of this text we learn something about the properties of our service.
[time=2902] Now in verse 12 we are told that there are some building materials that we use.
[time=2908] Please notice that in verse 9 Paul changes his figure of speech.
[time=2914] In the first few verses he has been using agriculture as his teaching tool.
[time=2919] Now in these next verses he is going to use architecture and he makes the transition in verse 9.
[time=2924] For we are laborers together with God, you are God's cultivated field, there is agriculture, you are God's building, there is architecture.
[time=2933] Now the next verses he is using architecture to teach this truth.
[time=2937] Notice what he says in verse 12.
[time=2939] Now if any man built upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay or stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest.
[time=2948] Now stop and just think about this a moment. Paul gives us six building materials.
[time=2954] Gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay and stubble.
[time=2957] But in reality there are only two.
[time=2960] The gold, silver and precious stones are the indestructible materials and the wood, hay and stubble are the destructible materials.
[time=2967] And Paul said to the Corinthians as Christians, you have the opportunity of building on the foundation of Jesus Christ, which is your salvation, a life made up of one or two kinds of materials.
[time=2980] You can build out of gold, silver and precious stone or you can build out of wood, hay and stubble.
[time=2986] But mind you, someday it will be told what materials you have used.
[time=2995] He says that someday just like a divine white fire, our lives will be brought before Jesus Christ at the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3004] And on the basis of what we have built into our lives, we will either survive that fire or our works will perish in the midst of it.
[time=3012] Notice gold, silver and precious stones move through the fire, untarnished.
[time=3017] Wood, hay and stubble are burned up immediately.
[time=3021] And what Paul is trying to teach us with this illustration from architecture is this.
[time=3026] That our lives as Christians are like a building which we are building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ, which is our salvation.
[time=3035] And our service as servants is made up of one or two kinds of materials.
[time=3041] Either we're building with things which will last for eternity, or we're building with those things which will perish when we perish.
[time=3049] Things which have no eternal value.
[time=3051] Now, it's interesting to note in this text that Paul does not say we shall be judged for how much we do, but we shall be judged for what sort we do.
[time=3062] He is not talking here about the quantity of our works, he is talking about the quality of our works.
[time=3069] He is dealing here with our motivation, with why we do what we do.
[time=3075] And men and women, that is the most sobering thought that I think a Christian can ever have.
[time=3080] That it is not how much I do for God that counts in the final day of the judgment, but it is what has motivated me to do it.
[time=3087] Why am I doing it, what is behind my doing it, and how do I keep doing it over and over through the years?
[time=3094] Is it for the glory of God, or is it for my own self and grandisement to just build myself up as a person in front of others?
[time=3102] And someday when we stand before Jesus Christ at the judgment seat, he will look right down into the recesses of our heart, he will strip aside everything we have done, and he will show us why we have done it.
[time=3112] And if we have not done it for his glory, it will just be burned up in a big puff of smoke.
[time=3118] I wonder if Christians really understood that, what a difference it would make in their lives.
[time=3124] We had a speaker here not too long ago who tried to make us believe that when we stand at the judgment seat of Christ, we are going to be judged for our sins.
[time=3131] And he used the text we read at the beginning of this hour to tell us that we would be judged for the works done in the flesh, whether they be good or evil.
[time=3140] And he tried to tell us that that was whether we did good things or whether we did sins, but the terms good and evil refer to this passage of Scripture in reference to the materials.
[time=3149] We shall be judged for the things done in the body, whether they be good, gold, silver, precious stones, or evil, wood, hay, or stubble, whether they be acceptable or unacceptable to God.
[time=3160] And what that teaches us is this, that just because we may be getting a lot of acclaim from people around us does not mean that what we do is going to last for eternity.
[time=3169] God is interested in what we put into it, whether or not it will stand the test of his close scrutiny.
[time=3179] I want you to notice fourthly the presentation.
[time=3185] For in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 13 we are told every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it.
[time=3194] Because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
[time=3202] Notice we are not being judged as people here, our work is being judged.
[time=3207] Some people try to tell us that this verse teaches that after you're a Christian you can lose your salvation because it says we are saved by fire.
[time=3214] Or some people don't make it through the fire. It's not us that's being judged, it's what we do.
[time=3218] It's the work of our hands as servants that's being judged.
[time=3222] And if that work is not motivated out of love for Christ and the desire to glorify him it won't survive the fire.
[time=3229] It will just be burned up when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3233] Paul writes of a day that is coming. He calls it the day, the day of Christ, when our hearts will be x-rayed.
[time=3240] That means they will be turned inside out and our work will be made manifest.
[time=3245] It will be stripped aside so that we can see all that it is.
[time=3248] It means to be made visible, it means to be open to sight, to appear in the true light.
[time=3254] All of our workmen in this world will be uncovered for what they really are.
[time=3259] And men and women are going to be a lot of surprises in that day.
[time=3262] Some of the people that in this generation we have thought of the greatest saints are going to walk into the kingdom of God naked.
[time=3269] Nothing that they can carry with them into the kingdom.
[time=3272] And some of the folks you've never heard about who sequester themselves in quiet rooms to pray for God's work
[time=3278] and who give quietly without any public acclaim for the glory of God are going to be those who in that day pass through the fire and carry everything they've done in this life with them.
[time=3288] The Bible says that the judgment seat of Christ is going to be a time of loss.
[time=3299] I can't put together in my theology completely how there can be sorrow at the judgment seat of Christ
[time=3305] except in this way that the Bible says that in heaven God is going to wipe away all of our tears.
[time=3310] That must mean there are going to be some, doesn't it?
[time=3313] I think the tears he's going to wipe away are the tears that we'll have when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ and realize how we have wasted our lives.
[time=3321] How as Christians we have so frivolously served God in the flesh.
[time=3326] And when we stand before Christ and what we have been and what we are is laid naked bare for us to see.
[time=3332] I can't imagine how we could walk away from that experience dry-eyed without remorse.
[time=3338] Thank God that eternity.
[time=3340] God is going to erase that from our minds but there's going to be a time when we suffer loss and the Scripture also teaches us that based upon our faithfulness here we will serve and reign with Christ in the millennial period.
[time=3352] And some folks who've had great domains down here aren't going to have anything to do for God in the Kingdom because their reward will be taken from them.
[time=3362] I want you to turn back in your Bibles to the fourth chapter in the fifth verse for one parting thought on this subject.
[time=3373] I think Paul is giving to us the key then to our lives as Christians in 1 Corinthians 4-5.
[time=3379] This is what he says to us in light of his truth.
[time=3382] Therefore, listen now, therefore judge nothing before the time.
[time=3387] Don't you be the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3389] Don't judge anything before the time until the Lord come who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness
[time=3396] and will make manifest the counsels of the heart, the very motivation of your being.
[time=3402] And then he says, "shall every man have praise of God, every man, shall we pray."
[time=3414] God in heaven, it is a fearful thing to consider our lives in light of this truth.
[time=3424] Any serious-minded Christian who reviews his life has to question how much of it has been done totally and completely
[time=3435] for the honor and glory of his Savior, the Lord Jesus.
[time=3439] Oh God, how our own emotions and our own needs and our own thoughts get mixed up in service so often.
[time=3447] How selfish we can be, how self-centered we can become.
