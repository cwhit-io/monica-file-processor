[time=0] (phone beeping) - From the Convocation Center
[time=27] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=35] (piano music)
[time=59] (singing in foreign language) - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=89] We welcome you to the morning service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=93] All of you who've gathered here in the auditorium for this second worship service, and now those of you who have joined us by way of television, the theme for the service today is the love of God.
[time=106] What the world needs most in 1981.
[time=110] It's not economic security.
[time=113] It is not peace instead of war.
[time=117] All of those things are important and felt needs, but what the world needs most this year is a real demonstration of God's kind of love.
[time=128] And we'll be talking about that and singing about it and sharing about it today.
[time=133] Right now, we're going to listen to the ministry of Mr. Ron Hackett.
[time=137] As he reminds us that we love because God loves us, and has demonstrated his love to us and for us through his gift of Jesus Christ who died for our sin at Calvary.
[time=150] Calvary covers it all.
[time=152] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=300] [MUSIC] How precious the thought [MUSIC] That a soul by him brought [MUSIC] Shall be his [MUSIC] In the glory of God [MUSIC] Wherewith gladness and song [MUSIC] I'll be one of the throng [MUSIC] For Calvary covers it all [MUSIC]
[time=340] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=410] We're so happy to have you with us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=413] And my friend Mr. Rick Hawks is here on the set with us today, and we're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[time=418] But before we do that, let me bring you up to date on the project that we've been involved in during these past days.
[time=424] Many of you have received from my office a special letter telling you about the project that we have organized in order to make sure that the Bible Hour is debt free when we conclude our ministry here on television in just a few weeks.
[time=437] I want to say a special thank you to all of you who have written and enclosed a gift, and I know that as we continue to trust God to see this need met, we are going to go over the top.
[time=449] But if we do, it's going to take some help from some of the rest of you who have yet not responded.
[time=454] I think it'd be interesting for you to know that the largest gift we have received in this project so far is $1,500.
[time=461] I think that's typical of what has happened in the past for the support of the Bible Hour.
[time=465] The Bible Hour has been supported not by gigantic gifts in the tens of thousands, but by the gifts of individuals who have given, as they could, sacrificial gifts.
[time=476] We still believe that someone listening to us today is capable of giving that one big gift that would help the Bible Hour over this hump, and I just like to ask you to consider doing that.
[time=487] Maybe you could be the one person who could help us in a substantial way during this special fund drive to make sure that the Bible Hour continues on your station to preach the Word of God and to hold up God's truth in this day when there are very few people who are doing that.
[time=503] If you'd like to help us, we'd sure like to hear from you, and I hope you'll get in touch with us this week.
[time=508] In just a moment, I'll give you the address, but before I do that, I'm going to remind you that our special gift offer during this period of time is a booklet of two messages that I preached some time ago here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=520] Messages on the subjects of prophecy are we living in the last days, is the first message, and the second message has to do with the Battle of Armageddon.
[time=529] These messages are printed attractively in a four-color-covered book, and we'd like to send it to you absolutely free if you'll just write to us.
[time=537] One you write, right to me, Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=545] We'll be happy to enclose this booklet in an envelope and send it to you right away just as soon as we hear from you.
[time=552] Now, Mr. Rick Hawks has been on our staff for about four years, and Rick, you have held a number of positions here, but your major emphasis has been with young people and then in the area of evangelism.
[time=563] Right, I've been here four years, and I've enjoyed the four years immensely as I've had opportunity to grow from one position to another, and at this time, my major emphasis has been with youth, college, and the adult evangelism program.
[time=577] During that time, you've had opportunity to preach, and God has really given you an exceptional gift for communication, Rick.
[time=584] And I think one of the things that happens when we discover that we enjoy preaching
[time=590] is that every time we do it, we like to do it more than we did the time before.
[time=594] At least that's what happened to me.
[time=595] Well, that's certainly true in my own life.
[time=597] I'm probably the only person in Fort Wayne that looks forward to you going on vacation, because that creates opportunity for me to serve in the pulpit here and to speak, and I've really enjoyed that over the past years.
[time=608] Well, Rick, during these next few days and weeks of transition, as the church here seeks a new leader, you're going to have many opportunities to be doing some of that preaching, both in the morning, on television and also in the evening services.
[time=621] And I know you're excited about that, although I'm also aware from our conversation that it's kind of an awesome thing to think about, isn't it?
[time=628] Oh, it's a very, very intimidating responsibility to take over in a small way
[time=634] some of your responsibilities, but I'm trusting God to give me the wisdom and to fulfill that challenge, and I'm excited about that.
[time=641] And I know the people who watch the Bible Hour are in for a real exciting treat as they share in your ministry in the way God has equipped you to preach the Word of God.
[time=651] In between your preaching assignments, we're going to be hearing from some other folks, and I know that the first man is known to some of our Bible Hour friends, and maybe you could tell him a little bit about him.
[time=661] The first guest we'll be having is Dr. Haddon Robinson, who is the President of Conservative Baptist Seminary in Denver, Colorado.
[time=670] I believe he was your homiletics, our preaching teacher, not too long ago.
[time=675] That's true, and Dr. Robinson has a real interest in this church and is concerned about what goes on here, and he'll be speaking and sharing with us very soon.
[time=684] I hope you'll continue to be a part of the Bible Hour as we share together in God's truth during these days.
[time=690] Once again, if you need to get in touch with us right to Pastor David Jeremiah, post Office Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 8, 1, 5.
[time=705] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=724] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[time=747] He gave his life what more could he give.
[time=758] Oh, how he loves you.
[time=801] He gave his life what more could he give.
[time=812] Oh, how he loves you.
[time=919] [MUSIC]
[time=933] Content played it. Think about it. He loves us.
[time=938] When we were unlovely and unworthy and without any reason whatsoever to give him for loving us,
[time=946] the Bible says he loved us.
[time=949] Here in his love, not that we love God, but that he loved us and gave his son to us.
[time=957] We have just finished celebrating the incarnation, the coming into the world of God's son,
[time=965] and the song that Dennis and Ron are going to sing for us remind us that that was God's wonderful picture of love.
[time=973] It was when God became a man.
[time=977] [MUSIC]
[time=1006] Love was when God became a man.
[time=1018] Not in time and space without break a place.
[time=1033] Love was gone.
[time=1038] More love to be skinned.
[time=1045] Just a car and turn with some fisheries.
[time=1060] Love was when Jesus walked in history,
[time=1074] lovingly proud, a new life that stayed.
[time=1087] Love was gone.
[time=1093] Nails you bleed and are to reach and love ones such as love.
[time=1113] [MUSIC]
[time=1136] Love was when God became a man.
[time=1149] Down where I could see.
[time=1155] Love that reached me.
[time=1163] Love was gone, dying for my sin.
[time=1175] And so trapped was I, my whole world gave me.
[time=1190] Love was when Jesus met me now in three.
[time=1203] Love in me came, I can feel this dream.
[time=1217] Love was gone.
[time=1222] Only He would try to reach and love one such as love.
[time=1243] [MUSIC]
[time=1272] Thank you, Ron and Dennis.
[time=1274] We have been hearing so much about God's love for us.
[time=1278] Before the message this morning, let's just reflect our love for Him.
[time=1282] And that simple little chorus that we sing on occasion, Lord, we love You.
[time=1287] I lift up our praise to Him.
[time=1289] Let's stand together as we do it, shall we?
[time=1292] Lord, we love You.
[time=1314] We love You.
[time=1324] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1332] Open your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians and the 13th chapter.
[time=1337] 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=1342] Following your Bibles, as I read from mine, this most beautiful chapter perhaps in all of the New Testament,
[time=1349] maybe even in all of the Scripture, the great chapter on love.
[time=1357] Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love, I am become as sounding bronze or a tinkling symbol.
[time=1366] And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love, I am nothing.
[time=1379] And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
[time=1389] Love suffers long and is kind, love envious not, love won'teth not itself is not puffed up, death not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.
[time=1402] Rejoiceeth not in iniquity, but rejoiceeth in the truth.
[time=1406] Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
[time=1411] Love never faileth, but whether there be prophecies they shall be done away, whether there be tongues they shall cease,
[time=1417] whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away.
[time=1420] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
[time=1428] When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
[time=1438] For now we see in a mirror darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then shall I know even as I am known.
[time=1447] And now abide a faith hope love these three, but the greatest of these is love.
[time=1454] This is a two-part message on the subject, what the world needs most in 1981.
[time=1463] In this morning's message, I am going to describe for you a quality.
[time=1469] And this evening, as we gather for our Sunday evening Bible study, I am going to practically demonstrate from this chapter how that quality works
[time=1479] and how it can change even your personality so that you can become the kind of person who embodies this great truth.
[time=1489] Shall we pray together?
[time=1491] Father, in our hearts as we face the beginning and early days of a new year, we so want to let the Word of God and its truth fill us.
[time=1504] We want God's thoughts to be ours. We want to sense the need in our own life and to find that need met in the truth of God's Word.
[time=1514] So in this message, which deals with the concept, cause it to be clear in our own minds and in our hearts.
[time=1523] Lord, there are some who really need to hear this.
[time=1526] We know not who they be or their circumstances, but we pray that you will open their heart to receive this truth.
[time=1533] Lord, break down the barriers that may be constructed already.
[time=1538] And may this truth find lodging in their own hearts, for I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1546] Today's world is crying out for an outpouring of genuine love,
[time=1555] love which relieves the stresses and strain in humanity, that heals the wounds that are inflicted in relationships with one another,
[time=1566] love that will unite those that are separated by misunderstanding and by hatred and by jealousies.
[time=1574] It is no secret that to love and be loved is one of man's basic needs and desires.
[time=1581] In many ways, we are shaped by those who love us and by those who refuse to love us.
[time=1588] The Lord Jesus Christ said that all of the law and all of the commandments hung on this one truth,
[time=1595] that we were to love God with all of our heart and our neighbor as ourself.
[time=1602] Frustration, loneliness, self-pity, indifference, emptiness, hostility, hatred, close-heartedness, resentment, jealousy,
[time=1617] and all of the criminal acts that grow out of those attitudes are like weeds that fill the holes that are gouged in our hearts
[time=1626] when no one seems to care. Dr. Carl Meninger, leading American psychiatrist, has found that people who are able to give and receive love
[time=1638] recover more quickly from their illnesses.
[time=1641] In contrast, individuals who lack love often develop personality scars. Indeed, he said some of them even die.
[time=1651] Love is essential to our emotional, to our physical, to our mental, to our social, to our spiritual well-being.
[time=1658] Without it we cannot be what God wants us to be, what he created us to be.
[time=1664] Several years ago, Dr. Eric Byrne wrote a book entitled "Games People Play."
[time=1670] In his bestseller, he discusses the tremendous need that people have for encouragement by word and by touch.
[time=1678] He describes it this way. He says they need it to keep their spinal cords from shriveling.
[time=1684] To keep them alive and eager and confident, and his book, which is satire almost,
[time=1692] is about all of the crazy games that human beings play in order to try to get the love that they're not getting.
[time=1700] I promise you, if you read it, you'll find yourself in there and you'll find some of the games you've played.
[time=1707] Dr. Renee Spitz was in charge of 91 infants in a foundling home.
[time=1713] The babies in that home received plenty of good food. They got good clothing and light and air and toys and confident care.
[time=1724] But they lacked one indispensable thing. They did not have a mother.
[time=1730] Nurses in that home cared for ten infants each, and so each child had one tenth of a mother.
[time=1739] Three months in this home was enough to produce marked changes in the babies' personalities.
[time=1745] Dr. Spitz studied what happened to those children, and he learned that 30% of the children in that home died within the first year of existence.
[time=1753] And 21 of those children developed such personality aberrations that one could only describe them as seriously maladjusted.
[time=1764] You see, love gives life its deepest meaning. And without it, life loses all of its purpose.
[time=1773] How tragic, for instance, is the story of a 14-year-old boy who committed suicide and left instructions for the care of his dog.
[time=1785] His dog he felt was the only one who really cared anything about him, and so he was the only one he cared about in his death.
[time=1794] This young man represents many people that you know and that I know who feel as the psalmist David felt when he wrote the words of Psalm 142 verse 14.
[time=1808] "I looked on my right hand and behold, there was no man that would know me, refuge failed me," said David, "no man cared for my soul."
[time=1821] The world is populated with people like that who need to know love.
[time=1828] One of the problems we have in loving is trying to understand what it is.
[time=1833] For instance, my son David loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[time=1839] I mean, he loves them. You ask him. I love him.
[time=1843] I love my wife. I remember when our children were little, my wife carrying the little baby in her arms and saying over and over again, "I love you."
[time=1855] On Christmas morning at our Christmas celebration, my little girl Jan got some kind of clothing that she was wanting really badly, and she held it up, and she said, "I just love it."
[time=1871] Recently went to help a friend who was in need, and he called me yesterday, and he said, "I just want you to know I love you for taking time to be near."
[time=1882] What is love? Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?
[time=1888] New clothes? Being with a friend? Loving your wife? Being a good parent?
[time=1895] In my study for these messages this week, I have come to one basic underlying conclusion that has overwhelmed me, and it's all of its nuances, and that is this, that most Christians are trying to do something they don't understand.
[time=1911] We talk about love, and what we talk about comes through to our consciousness in terms of what we see in our world today.
[time=1919] Love in its cheapest form, but that's not what God is talking about.
[time=1924] Now, briefly in survey, there are four words in the Bible for love in the New Testament. The first word is the word "stergo."
[time=1930] It is pronounced as it is spelled in the English language, S-T-E-R-G-O.
[time=1936] Sterego is used twice in the New Testament once in Romans 1, and once in 1 Timothy chapter 3, and it is a very, very light word for natural affections.
[time=1948] In both of those passages of Scripture, Paul is saying that in the end time, men are going to be void of natural affection.
[time=1955] They will do away with family ties. There won't be any natural affection within the family.
[time=1960] That's what the word "stergo" means. That's not what God's talking about when he says love. That's on the bottom rung.
[time=1967] There is another word for love, and this one's not even found in the Bible.
[time=1972] It is the word "aeros," but it comes to us from the Greek culture, and it's certainly one we ought to know about, because in my estimation, it is the word which epitomizes all of the truth about love that is disseminated through the media today and through Hollywood and all of the other things that are talking about love.
[time=1989] They're not talking about God's kind of love, they're talking about "aeros." Aeros is the word from which we get our word "erotic." It is love rooted in passion. It seeks satisfaction through sexual activity.
[time=2008] Aeros may appear to be love, but men and women, it is the height of selfishness.
[time=2016] It is the antithesis to love. Aeros says, "I love you because you give me pleasure."
[time=2026] And if you stop giving me pleasure, I'll quit loving you.
[time=2030] Listen to the music. Read the novels, watch the movies, and you'll discover that 98% of love, as we see it in our world today as "aeros" love, and that word's not even in the Bible.
[time=2043] That is not to say that passion has no place in Christian love. The Bible says that marriage is honorable and the bed undefiled and passion and love within the boundaries of marriage are proper and good and beautiful.
[time=2056] But it is not love, it is an outgrowth of love.
[time=2061] The third word is the word "phileo." Phileo is friendship. It is a Greek word which describes the enjoyment that we gain from another's company.
[time=2078] Phileo is fond attraction and affection between people who thoroughly enjoy and like one another.
[time=2085] Although it is not free from selfish motivation, Phileo is willing to give of itself.
[time=2092] Phileo understands the other's weaknesses, but because of his or her good points,
[time=2098] Phileo love determines to accept the weaknesses in the give and take of everyday living.
[time=2105] What you know, life is not always smooth sailing.
[time=2110] When the storms come, Phileo is not enough.
[time=2116] For you see, Phileo love is fifty-fifty. It says this, give some love, take some love.
[time=2124] If one fails to give or a real problem develops, Phileo disintegrates and selfishness surfaces.
[time=2132] And so what was companionship becomes conflict and what was friendship becomes fraction.
[time=2140] The marriage is on the rocks, so the relationship is all over. In my estimation, far too many of the Christian marriages are based upon Phileo love.
[time=2151] I'll give and you give. If you stop giving, I stop giving. It's fifty-fifty.
[time=2160] I read some time ago about a man who loved a girl so much that when she refused to marry him, he threw acid in her face.
[time=2168] And blinded her for life.
[time=2172] After he got out of prison, he proposed to her again and she married him, both of those situations they called love.
[time=2183] The Bible is not talking about stare go love, eros love or Phileo love.
[time=2189] In the book which we have read, 1 Corinthians, the word is agape.
[time=2195] Men and women, I want to take these moments that I have in this message this morning to try to help you understand at the deepest level of your being what that word really means.
[time=2206] Because that is what God has called us to be in our world, in our homes, in our churches, in our relationships and without it.
[time=2215] We cannot be obedient to God. Agape love is giving of oneself.
[time=2226] The word describes a love that comes from and is rooted in God, in his very nature. It is totally selfless love. It delights in giving.
[time=2237] Even though the loved one may be unkind and unloving and unworthy, agape willingly gives.
[time=2245] Agape by an act of the will determines to do whatever is best for the one loved.
[time=2251] It willingly sacrifices itself for another's good. Agape gives when even nothing comes back.
[time=2260] Agape does not think in terms of 50/50. Agape thinks in terms of 100/0.
[time=2268] It says, "I will give a hundred percent if nothing comes back to me."
[time=2277] Men and women, it is this agape love that God commands us to express and exhibit and to put on display.
[time=2285] You'll be interested to know that God instructs us to love at least 55 times in the New Testament. It is a command.
[time=2293] It is one of the scriptures most repeated and inescapable directions for the believer.
[time=2299] It touches all of our relationships. It touches parents and husbands and wives and friends and church members.
[time=2308] In fact, Matthew 5 even tells us we're to love our enemies.
[time=2315] Now Christ demonstrated what He was talking about when He went to the cross and the Scripture tells us that while He was on the cross, those who were abusing Him, He prayed for their forgiveness.
[time=2326] And Romans chapter 5 tells us that while we were enemies Christ died for us.
[time=2333] That's what agape love is. It is giving, giving, giving when nothing comes back.
[time=2339] And that's the kind of love God is talking about when He tells us we are to love.
[time=2344] Now the Bible tells us as believers that we are not only to love one another, but we are to act in love.
[time=2351] Now listen to these, write these references down if you have a pencil.
[time=2355] Believers are to follow in the way of love, 1 Corinthians 14-1, to do everything in love, 1 Corinthians 16-14, to serve one another in love, Ephesians 4-2,
[time=2368] to live a life of love, Ephesians 5-2, to speak the truth in love, Ephesians 4-15,
[time=2375] to put on love, Colossians 3, to pursue love, 1 Timothy 2, to spur one another on to love, Hebrews 10,
[time=2384] to love not only in words but in actions and in truth, 1 John 3-18.
[time=2391] We are to be controlled by the Holy Spirit, and the Bible says that when we are filled with the Spirit,
[time=2397] we will exhibit the fruit of the Spirit, and what is that?
[time=2400] The fruit of the Spirit is first and foremost love.
[time=2405] In this passage, which we have read in the 12th chapter verse 31, after describing all of the exuberant and out bursting gifts of the Spirit, Paul said at the end of the chapter, I show you a more excellent way.
[time=2418] And at the end of chapter 13, he says, now abide with these three, faith, hope, and love, and the greatest is love.
[time=2428] It is the more excellent way, it is the greatest.
[time=2431] The Bible says that we are to love God's way, and that way is the Kape love.
[time=2437] Now I was interested this week in reading the Epistles to discover that not only are we to love this way, but we are to make it our goal to continue to grow and develop in this whole concept of God's love.
[time=2453] And I'm asking God in my life in this new year to somehow help me develop the quality
[time=2459] of this kind of love more and more because it makes such a difference.
[time=2464] For instance, when Paul was writing to the Philippians in the first chapter, verse 9, this is what he said to them.
[time=2471] He said, in this I pray that you may abound more and more in love.
[time=2477] You have it already, but don't stop there.
[time=2479] Keep growing in that grace and develop it in your life.
[time=2482] He wrote to the Colossians in chapter 2 of his writings to them, and he said that your hearts may be encouraged having been knit together in agape, in love.
[time=2493] He wrote to the Thessalonians in the fourth chapter of 1 Thessalonians, and he said, now as to the love of the brethren, listen, we urge you to excel more and more.
[time=2507] And when Peter wrote in 1 Peter 1 verses 21 and 22, he said fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=2518] Agape love is God's love.
[time=2522] Now it is here that I need to get very specific.
[time=2525] This is all by way of introduction.
[time=2530] This agape love, just what is it?
[time=2535] You say pastor love is a feeling.
[time=2537] You can't command a feeling.
[time=2541] I just don't feel anything for her anymore.
[time=2546] But love is not a feeling.
[time=2550] God has commanded us to love.
[time=2553] If feelings cannot be commanded, then God was in air.
[time=2558] But you see love is not a feeling.
[time=2560] Love is an action, and God commands us to love.
[time=2564] Love is giving of one's self to another, and that is a skill that one can develop in the strength of God's spirit.
[time=2573] Love is doing. It is acting.
[time=2575] It is involving yourself with the person you are to love.
[time=2579] Turn in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 5.
[time=2583] Here in my estimation is one of the great illustrations of God's kind of love.
[time=2589] As he teaches us what it is to love.
[time=2594] The modern concept of love is that it's some sort of a warm feeling that begins to gravitate somewhere in your midsection.
[time=2603] And that if you have that feeling, you've got it.
[time=2608] But notice what God says to us in Matthew 5 and verse 44.
[time=2612] But I say unto you, love your enemies.
[time=2617] Notice now, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them who despitefully use you, and persecute you.
[time=2625] Men and women, you do not develop feelings of love for your enemy by sitting in a dark room thinking about your need to love them.
[time=2635] Feelings always follow action.
[time=2638] Feelings are the fruit, not the initiator of love.
[time=2643] You cannot sit around womping up a good feeling for your enemies.
[time=2649] It just doesn't come that way.
[time=2653] But if you give yourself to them, if you give them something to drink, if you give them something to eat, something happens in your feelings when you invest yourself in someone else, and you begin to feel differently toward them.
[time=2671] Dr. S. I. McMillan has written a very interesting book called "None of These Diseases," and he talks about how we are so involved
[time=2680] in the emotional and interpersonal relationships that they even get to our health and destroy us.
[time=2686] And he has a very good statement at this point in our discussion this morning, and I want to read that statement so you will understand for it is filled with an illustration that will help you to comprehend what we're talking about.
[time=2699] Dr. McMillan writes, "When I quote the Bible to people who are suffering physically or mentally from a lack of love, some of them retort that it is very difficult
[time=2709] to change one's feelings, to change hate to love." And that is true, he said.
[time=2717] Psychologists support this view claiming that the will does not have complete control over the emotions.
[time=2723] However, these same psychologists state that the will has good control over actions.
[time=2731] Our wills largely do have the power to decide what we do and what we don't do.
[time=2738] This is very fortunate for you see actions over which we do have power
[time=2744] that can change our feelings.
[time=2747] That's what Matthew 544 is all about.
[time=2750] It says love your enemies and then it gives us three ways of doing it.
[time=2754] Do good, bless and pray.
[time=2756] All three are actions and when we put those into operation we are loving.
[time=2764] Dr. McMillan goes on to say, "Do good to them that hate you impossible.
[time=2768] Not if you follow some easy directions and hear other directions, please take notes." The first step in the performance of the impossible is to walk out into your kitchen.
[time=2780] Now you can do that, you've done that hundreds of times before.
[time=2786] Step number two is to make a lemon meringue pie.
[time=2790] Make it so beautiful that it looks like it just came off the cover of that magazine you get.
[time=2797] You have made your pie so far so good.
[time=2801] You're already feeling better, aren't you?
[time=2805] Step number three, give your feet the sternest look they have ever gotten.
[time=2813] And inform them in a tone of authority, feet.
[time=2817] You are going to carry me and this pie to Mrs. Quirk's.
[time=2823] Oh yes, I know you haven't been there in a long time, but today you're going to take us there.
[time=2829] Off you go.
[time=2831] As you began your adventure to seek the golden fleece of love, you feel strangely different.
[time=2837] You feel warm behind and a little to the left of your wishbone.
[time=2843] You sense something wonderful is happening inside.
[time=2847] Across the railroad tracks you go.
[time=2850] And down the dingy alley called Depot Street.
[time=2853] You began to understand Mrs. Quirk's attitude.
[time=2858] As a heavy noisy freight train passes shaking houses and sidewalks.
[time=2864] As the black soot soils your immaculate white gloves.
[time=2869] And as dirty boisterous children send shivers up your spine with shrieks and cursing.
[time=2877] Yes, you say if I had to live here I think I would be irritable too.
[time=2882] As you go up the stairs you cannot help smiling at the new role you're playing.
[time=2887] You wrap at the door and you wait.
[time=2889] To Mrs. Quirk's truly surprised look you present your peace offering.
[time=2893] And you throw in a beautiful smile just for good measure.
[time=2898] A little chat in the living room.
[time=2901] Cordial invitation for her to visit you.
[time=2903] Then on leaving a mutual hug and kiss.
[time=2906] The fervor and spontaneity of it surprises both of you.
[time=2911] You sense that a divine miracle has happened inside.
[time=2916] The love of God is coursing through your whole being.
[time=2920] The impossible has happened.
[time=2922] On your way home.
[time=2924] You feel like skipping along the street as you did when you were a little child.
[time=2929] Inside is the spirit of singing and summer.
[time=2933] Absent for many a year you now feel so well that you decide not to stop at the doctors
[time=2939] to take that shot for frayed nerves because your nerves aren't frayed anymore.
[time=2944] You never felt better in your life even the pain in your back is gone.
[time=2952] The poet describes it this way.
[time=2955] He said he drew a little circle that shut me out.
[time=2960] Heretic rebel a thing to flout.
[time=2964] But love and I had the wit to win.
[time=2967] We drew a little circle that took him in.
[time=2972] Love is action.
[time=2975] When God commands you to love he does not ask you if you feel like it.
[time=2980] Or if you want to he says do it.
[time=2983] And when you do it you will be exhibiting that love through attitudes and actions.
[time=2988] You will not love in word only but in word and in truth and indeed.
[time=2997] Agape love is giving of yourself without expecting anything in return.
[time=3003] Now in marriage a couple usually gets married for romantic reasons.
[time=3008] At least that's what I hear.
[time=3011] But if romance is to continue and if the emotional attraction is to deepen Agape love must also be present which is the total giving of oneself to the marriage partner.
[time=3025] So that as each partner by an act of the will and regardless of personal feelings or seeming worth of his or her partner willingly sacrifices himself romantic feelings are produced.
[time=3038] So often we try to make it happen the other way.
[time=3042] One out of two couples goes to the divorce court today.
[time=3046] And I've heard it said so much this year even from some folks who come to church here and others I know we just don't love each other anymore.
[time=3057] But men and women God's commanded you to love.
[time=3061] He's commanded you to love your wife, to love your husband.
[time=3065] And when you say we just don't do it what you're saying is we won't do as God has commanded us.
[time=3070] We refuse to do it.
[time=3075] You see Agape love is the one solid basis for marriage.
[time=3079] A husband is expected according to God's command to seek his wife's well-being whether she deserves it or not.
[time=3089] And in the process he is not to seek for anything in return.
[time=3095] He is simply to give of himself because he has been commanded to do so by God.
[time=3102] Now it is failure at this point folks that is destroying so many marriages.
[time=3108] The picture people have of love is so distorted.
[time=3113] This is an orange.
[time=3116] I got so many of these for Christmas I had to figure out some way to use them.
[time=3121] I really love oranges and we've eaten them and juiced them and everything else.
[time=3129] I love oranges.
[time=3133] What am I saying?
[time=3137] What I'm really saying is oranges do something for me.
[time=3142] But after I squeeze everything I like out of this orange I throw the peelings away.
[time=3152] In my estimation that's the modern concept of marriage.
[time=3156] The man says I love you to a woman. What he really means is you do something for me.
[time=3164] And after I squeeze all I want out of you I will throw you away just like an orange.
[time=3172] She just doesn't do anything for me anymore.
[time=3180] But you see God's love doesn't ask what does she do for me. God's love asks am I giving myself to her?
[time=3191] Immature love follows the principle I love because I'm loved.
[time=3203] Immature love says I love you because I need you.
[time=3213] How do we get this love?
[time=3216] And how can it work in our lives?
[time=3219] There's no store where you can buy it.
[time=3222] There's no psychologist where you can purchase it.
[time=3225] There's no seminar where you can learn it.
[time=3230] Men and women it comes from God.
[time=3234] The Bible says God is love. It is his nature to love.
[time=3240] And when you accept Christ and you come to know God he gives you his nature and it comes to live within you.
[time=3250] And as long as you allow his nature to live in you and you cooperate with it and you yield yourself to the nature of God within you.
[time=3260] Romans 5.5 says that the love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Spirit which he's given to you.
[time=3267] So that just as God selflessly gave himself to you by sending his son to die for your sin when you didn't deserve it at all
[time=3275] and when there was not anything you could ever give back to him.
[time=3279] God can give you that quality of love in your life when you receive his son into your heart and you give him first place
[time=3286] and ask him to rule in your life and to develop that quality of love within you.
[time=3292] You get love when you get God and you get God when you get Jesus Christ in your life because Jesus Christ is God in the flesh.
[time=3304] And Christians you have the equipment to love God's way.
[time=3311] But if you don't use it you're just as pagan in love as the man who's never heard about Christ.
[time=3317] God has given you the equipment to love according to his love but you have to turn it on by yielding to that nature
[time=3327] and saying God I don't know how to love but help me love and I will love through you and I will be obedient to you
[time=3334] and I will go forward and do the things that represent love to that person I'm called to love and I will depend upon you to restore the feelings that have been frayed and broken.
[time=3343] I will love.
[time=3348] God has promised that if you will do that he will do his part and his promises are always good shall we pray.
[time=3368] As we close the service if you who are watching by television do not know God and his love.
[time=3374] You may know him today by simply inviting his son Jesus Christ to come into your life and be your savior.
[time=3380] Receiving him into your heart asking for forgiveness of your sin and when you get God you get his love.
[time=3387] Do it today wherever you are whatever your circumstance it.
[time=3391] Just pray the simple prayer God be merciful to me a sinner and save me for Jesus sake and he'll do it.
