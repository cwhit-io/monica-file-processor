[time=0] from the Convocation Center of the
[time=18] Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah. Thank you and you may be seated and we welcome you now to
[time=50] this service. This is the second morning worship service of the Blackhawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana. And it is our privilege during this hour to share this opportunity of worship, the ministry of the Word of God with our friends at home by way of television. We're grateful that you have been able to join us and we trust that this will be a time of blessing and encouragement to you as you share in this service right there in your home. Our special guest musician today is Ellen Rotten. She will be singing for us in a few moments along with Steve and Maria Gardner. But right now let's listen to our choir as they sing a song that relates to the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, the comforter has come.
[time=121] [MUSIC - 248 seconds]
[time=374] - Way back in the beginning of the television ministry and when the church was still meeting over in the chapel, our first auditorium building, we began having, on occasion, some musical guests come and minister to us, and one of the very first was Ellen Rotten.
[time=392] And she has been one of our favorite ever since.
[time=394] She has been back many times.
[time=397] We have shared in the joys of some additions to her family since that day.
[time=403] And every time she comes, she has some new music that she's written, some new things that she's recorded.
[time=408] She is always a blessing to us because she not only is a talented singer, but she has a heart for Christ.
[time=415] I know that you'll be blessed as she prepares our hearts for the ministry of the Word of God with this beautiful gospel song.
[time=422] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=639] - We're so happy to have you with us on the Bible Hour today,
[time=655] and in just a few moments we have some special guests we want to introduce on the set, but my first special guest is my wife Donna.
[time=662] Donna, you have some things you want to share with the friends at home that will help them in their study of the Word of God, so why don't you start things off?
[time=670] - Prophecy is always an interesting topic of conversation amongst Christians,
[time=676] and recently my husband has preached a couple of messages on prophecy, one of which was "Are We Living in the Last Days?" and another one was the Battle of Armageddon, and he has put those together in book form because we've had so many people ask if they couldn't have a copy of it,
[time=691] and we would like to make this booklet available to you.
[time=694] All you need to do is write to us and ask us for the book on prophecy, and we'll be glad to send it to you.
[time=700] Our mailing address is Pastor David Jeremiah, Post Office Box 15,000,
[time=706] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=709] - Donna, when our friends are writing, we want to encourage them also to remember that we're in a very special fund drive at this time for television.
[time=717] I have affectionately dubbed it "The Exit Project." I don't suppose that's a very good title for it, but it really means that we're trying during these closing days of our ministry here to make sure that the television ministry is absolutely debt free and ready to move into the transitional phase of its ministry without being encumbered with the indebtedness that we've carried for such a long time.
[time=741] We have had such a good response from so many people.
[time=744] Many of you have written to us personally, have encouraged us with your letters, and we have received many, many gifts, both small and large, from people throughout the Bible Hour Network area, but we are still a long way from our goal.
[time=759] And if we're going to reach that goal, it's going to be necessary for you to get involved.
[time=764] Now, I suppose you're like some of the folks who, even at church, when we have a special offering, say, "Well, I'll wait and see whether they meet the goal before I give."
[time=773] I want to tell you that if we don't all get involved in this project, we are going to fall far below the goal that was projected, and the Bible Hour will go into a transitional phase with some real problems to deal with apart from selecting another speaker and moving into the next phase of its ministry here in the Midwest.
[time=793] I want to ask you to help us, if you will, to meet this goal so that the Bible Hour people who are involved in its production and the men and women who are involved in leadership here in this church will be able to concentrate wholeheartedly on the choice of another speaker for the days ahead and not have to give themselves completely to the financial details of this ministry.
[time=816] We have received many gifts, the largest of which is $1,500, and I know there are people who are part of the Bible Hour family who can do substantially more than that, giving a large gift, maybe a $5,000 or $10,000 that would put us over the top.
[time=833] We're waiting for that one gift that would happen like that, and perhaps you could be the one who would do it.
[time=838] I hope you'll pray about it today.
[time=840] The Bible Hour has been a blessing in your life.
[time=842] This is a chance for you to get involved in sharing financially with this need.
[time=846] When you send your gift, send it to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box, $15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=854] This is tax deductible, and we will send you a receipt as soon as we hear from you.
[time=858] Now, my guests on the set today are Mr. Don Kruger and Mr. Rick Hawks.
[time=863] Rick has been with us before, but this is the first time for Don to be sitting here in this cozy little setting, and Don, I think most of the folks who watch the Bible Hour are familiar with you because of your ministry.
[time=874] Why don't you share just a brief statement of your part in the ministry here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=881] Pastor, I'm the Minister of Music here, as many of the people know on television, and it's my responsibility to take care of all the music that we see on the Bible Hour, and direct the congregation, the congregational singing, which is always a joy, and I enjoy the ministry here very, very much.
[time=898] Also, the producer of our musicals, which are widely known throughout this area, most of the folks who watch television are very familiar with our patriotic panorama, and also with the Living Christmas Tree, and maybe I should give you just an opportunity to say that the Living Christmas Tree will be very special to you this year, won't it?
[time=916] Very special indeed, because this year I'm going to be using the music that I have written and Singspiration, Sound of Incorporation, has published this music.
[time=926] It's called "God Wrote the Song," and I'm just very excited about that, and it's a Christmas musical that talks about the fact that God used all the different personnel of the Christmas story, the Weizmann, Mary, and Joseph,
[time=941] and the angels, and the shepherds, and so on, to write the Christmas song and used all these people, but behind it all was God's hand.
[time=950] God wrote the song.
[time=952] Now, Rick, you and Don are going to be sharing this time that Don and I have had together, and you're going to be talking about the Bible Hour, and what are some of the things you'll be sharing in these next days?
[time=962] One of the things that I'll be doing and most excited about it in the next two weeks is preparing a series of messages out of the book of Philippians that we'll be sharing here almost every other week, alternating between myself and some of the special outside guests that we're looking forward to having also.
[time=980] And then you and Don will be talking to the friends at home like we do, telling them about special gift offers and updating them on the Bible Hour Ministry, keeping them in step with what's going on here so they'll know who's coming next week to speak and who the special musicians are and that sort of thing.
[time=997] Right, we look at this time as a chance just to sit down and talk with the television audience and share with you from the inside some of the things that are going on here and the things that we're looking forward to in the days ahead.
[time=1010] Well, I know that the friends who have been so kind to us will be kind to you, and you will get acquainted with many wonderful people in the days ahead.
[time=1019] And I want to encourage all of you who are watching to encourage Don and Rick just as you have Donna and me in the days ahead as they fill in this gap now in these next few weeks to share the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=1033] Before we go back to the service, let me remind you that your free copy of my book on Prophecy is available when you write to Pastor David Jeremiah, post office box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1072] Once again, the Lord begins its tuning.
[time=1080] Back in the meadows of my home.
[time=1088] Lord, to my heart, bring back the springtime.
[time=1100] Take away the cold and dark of sea.
[time=1109] Oh, refilling now, sweet Holy Spirit.
[time=1118] May I warm and tender be again.
[time=1130] Lord, make me like that stream that flows so cool and clear,
[time=1139] down from the mountains high above.
[time=1148] I will tell the world the wondrous story.
[time=1157] Of the stream that flows from cavalry.
[time=1166] Lord, to my heart, bring back the springtime.
[time=1175] Take away the cold and dark of sea.
[time=1184] Oh, refilling now, sweet Holy Spirit.
[time=1193] May I warm and tender be again.
[time=1202] Make me warm and tender.
[time=1217] Hey, man.
[time=1218] Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1220] Just before the message, let's listen again to the ministry of Ellen Rotten.
[time=1224] All of you here in this area that watch the telecast live will want to be here tonight
[time=1230] for a special musical ministry from Ellen Rotten.
[time=1234] She's going to sing tonight in the service all of those songs that she sang the very first time that we saw her and met her, dealing with what happened when she lost a child many years ago.
[time=1247] So gals, bring your Kleenexes with you.
[time=1250] And it'll be an emotional experience, but one with much teaching in it, too.
[time=1255] This evening at seven o'clock, but right now, before the message, she sings for us again.
[time=1279] You said you'd come and share all my sorrows.
[time=1289] You said you'd be there for all my tomorrow's.
[time=1298] I came so close to sending you away.
[time=1307] But just like you promised, you came there to stay.
[time=1317] I just had to pray.
[time=1326] And Jesus said come to the waters.
[time=1334] Stand by my side.
[time=1339] I know you are thirsty.
[time=1343] You won't be denied.
[time=1349] I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried.
[time=1363] And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1382] Jesus, I give you my heart and my soul.
[time=1391] I know that without you, I'd never be home.
[time=1400] Savior, you will bend all the right doors.
[time=1408] So I thank you, and I praise you.
[time=1413] Father, take me.
[time=1422] I'm yours.
[time=1428] And Jesus said come to the waters.
[time=1436] Stand by my side.
[time=1441] I know you are thirsty.
[time=1444] You won't be denied.
[time=1451] I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried.
[time=1465] And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1505] I died.
[time=1521] Thank you, Ellen.
[time=1523] Now I hope you brought your Bible with you because in our church we study the Bible together and we're going to read together a portion of the 11th chapter of John's gospel.
[time=1534] We are studying through the gospel of John and in the 11th chapter is the record of the resurrection of Lazarus.
[time=1543] And it's going to take us more than one time to get through all of that because it's such a rich miracle.
[time=1550] It is apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the most important miracle in the New Testament.
[time=1557] And it is filled with the poignancy of our Lord's wonderful ministry to those who hurt.
[time=1565] I want us to read today the 11th chapter verses 30 through 37, John chapter 11, beginning at the 30th verse and reading through verse 37.
[time=1579] Let's just remain seated as we read aloud together, everyone reading out loud from John 11 verse 30.
[time=1587] Now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where Martha met him.
[time=1595] The Jews then who were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there.
[time=1611] Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet saying unto him, Lord, if thou hast been here, my brother had not died.
[time=1625] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit and was troubled and said, where have you laid him?
[time=1639] They said unto him, Lord, come and see, Jesus wept, then said the Jews, behold how he loved him.
[time=1649] And some of them said, could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died, shall we pray together?
[time=1663] O Father, we pray that you will open our hearts and our minds to the comprehension of that which seems so incomprehensible that the Lord of glory, the creator of the universe and of all mankind should so identify with his creatures as to shed tears of anguish and hurt for their troubles.
[time=1692] We cannot understand it. There is no way that we shall ever be able to fully explain it.
[time=1701] But Father, as we explore it together, teach us its truth and help us to apply it to our own lives. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=1716] I have taught you before, as we have studied the Scripture together, that though the Word of God is inspired, and though every word, both verbally and planarily, is the Word of God, that there is a part of our understanding of the New Testament that is attributable to man.
[time=1740] That is the chapter and the verse division of the text. That is not inspired. That is not something that came down from heaven. There was a time and an editorial process in order to make the Bible more readable and more understandable that the thoughts of the Word of God were put together in segments we know as verses and chapters and they're not inspired.
[time=1761] Some of them in fact are in the wrong place in my estimation because thoughts are broken and concepts are interrupted. But there is one verse division in the 11th chapter of the Gospel of John that could not be better, and if any of them did come down from heaven, this certainly did.
[time=1780] For at the end of the 34th verse, and the beginning of the 36th verse, there is a break, and in between is the shortest verse in the Bible.
[time=1792] All of you who grew up in evangelical homes and went to Bible believing Sunday schools will know it immediately, for whenever there was a Bible verse memory drill, it was the first one to be taken from the list.
[time=1804] It simply says Jesus wept, John 1135.
[time=1811] Charles hadn't Spurgeon who for many years pastored the far famed metropolitan tabernacle in London, England, preached two whole sermons on those two verses.
[time=1824] And he said in one of his messages that there is infinitely more in those two words than any sermonizer or student of the Word would ever be able to bring out of them, even though he should apply the microscope of the utmost attentive consideration.
[time=1843] He said in essence that in that verse and in those two words is more to be learned of our Savior than any man could ever mine out in truth.
[time=1857] Here in these two verses is the second part, in these two words is the second part of our Lord's dealing with Lazarus.
[time=1867] In the first episode which we studied last time, Jesus is brought the news concerning Lazarus death, his sickness, and we learned that when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he abodes still yet two days where he was.
[time=1884] And then he left for Bethany.
[time=1887] The events which are recorded in that portion of Scripture which we have read this morning take place outside of the city of Bethany, the home of Mary and Martha and Lazarus.
[time=1898] The Scripture tells us that Mary is there and those Jews who had come to comfort her at the loss of her brother are there.
[time=1907] When Jesus comes and sees the tears of Mary and sees the Jews weeping, the Scripture tells us that he was so overwhelmed with grief that he wept.
[time=1922] I want you to understand this morning from these two words in verse 35 that we have before us a window into the soul and heart of our Lord.
[time=1933] If we would draw aside the shades and look through that window pane into his life, it will open up to us great vistas of understanding concerning the nature of the one whom we worship, even our Lord.
[time=1950] The Bible says Jesus wept and the word which is used to describe that in his life is an intensive Greek word which is best translated in our language by saying it this way.
[time=1965] When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews with her also weeping, he burst into tears. I cannot fathom that.
[time=1975] I cannot understand it, but the Scripture says that our Lord burst into tears in that emotional moment when he came near to the place where lay the body of his loved one, Lazarus.
[time=1988] Now, this truth teaches us much about our Lord. And the joy of studying the Gospel of John and all of the Gospels is that wherever you study it, you get a new understanding and comprehension of Christ, our Savior.
[time=2004] One pastor who I greatly admire, who pastors a large and influential church in the south, preaches on the life of Christ every single Sunday night in his church.
[time=2018] He preaches all of the other truths in the morning, and when he stands in the pulpit on Sunday night, he opens up the Gospels and preaches Christ, and he's been doing it for years.
[time=2027] And I understand why God has so richly blessed that church, for he has exalted the Lord. And the Bible says, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men to me." Christ has been lifted up.
[time=2037] And when I read the Gospel and I come to grips with Christ and all that there is to learn about him, and I do my best as a pastor to lift him up and exalt him before men, I know that that is honoring to the Lord, but I know that it is meaningful and helpful in my own life.
[time=2054] And when I read that Jesus wept, there are several truths that come home to my heart right out of the context that helped me to understand more about my Lord.
[time=2064] First of all, I learn from those two words about the humanity of Jesus Christ. I want to say this reverently, but I hope it will help you to understand what I'm talking about. Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, had real tear ducts just like you do.
[time=2084] And when he cried, the tears from his tear ducts coursed down real cheeks just like yours. And the tears were so constituted that they were made up of the same kinds of properties as your tears.
[time=2099] They were real, actual, literal tears that he cried. For you see, the Bible teaches that he was the God-man. The concept of the incarnation is that God took on a body, that it was the same kind of a body that you have and that I have and that God walked around in that body during the years of his earthly ministry.
[time=2123] And even though the Gospel of John is the greatest declaration of the deity of Christ that you will find any place in the New Testament, it is also filled with the truth of his humanity.
[time=2135] I have been teaching you as we've studied this Gospel, that the purpose for the writing of the Gospel of John is that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God. Many of our friends who watch at home have been given an opportunity to get a copy of a little booklet on the Gospel of John in the international version which outlines the deity of Christ by highlighting every single verse in green.
[time=2161] And when you open up that little Gospel and look at it, it looks like it's almost all green. For everywhere on almost every page is some indication that Christ is God.
[time=2172] But men and women, the beauty of this Gospel is that wedded to that truth is the truth that Christ is also man. He is the God-man and the man-God, the Son of God and the Son of Man.
[time=2187] And as you walk through the pages of the Gospel of John, you will see him our Savior seated at the well of Saikar saying, "I thirst to the woman of Samaria." And hanging from the cross in the closing chapter of that book, he cries out because in his human body he thirsts.
[time=2206] You will see him in the second chapter, walking into the temple and grabbing hold of a scourge and in white hot anger driving the mercenaries out of the temple in the emotional reaction to their corruption of that which is holy.
[time=2224] Over and over again in this Gospel are the illustrations of his humanity, but never and in no place under any circumstance is there a greater demonstration of the humanity of Christ than when he stands outside of Bethany with the loved ones of Lazarus and the Bible says that he weeps.
[time=2245] It is a reminder to us that all we know about Jesus is to help us understand that he was God's picture to us so that we could understand God.
[time=2257] God in heaven revealing himself to man by causing God to be incarcerated if you would in a body. And according to Luke chapter 2, he grew in wisdom and in stature in favor with God and in favor with man.
[time=2273] And in his growth as a young boy demonstrated all of the facets of human growth, he grew in stature physically and he grew in wisdom intellectually and he grew in favor with God spiritually and in favor with man socially.
[time=2289] In all of those areas that we experience growth, Jesus Christ experienced all of that having been born miraculously of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judea.
[time=2302] And when we read that he cried, we understand that he was human. Now that is a very important point for us to understand because the Scripture always holds him up as our example in suffering.
[time=2321] The Creator always tells us to look unto him, the author and finisher of our faith, the captain of our salvation, the one who we are to follow an example even in our suffering, for he suffered all that we suffer.
[time=2335] And there is a spiritual mentality present today that says yes, but he wasn't really human. He was divine and so in some way he didn't experience what we experienced.
[time=2347] And then I am. His body didn't have the hurts and the aches that my body has. His tears were different than my tears. And the Scripture is faithful in saying no, no, he was real human flesh walking among men.
[time=2363] When the Bible says Jesus wept, it teaches us of his humanity. Now secondly, when the Bible says that Jesus wept, it teaches us of his humility.
[time=2375] There is in our culture today the common conception that for us to weep is to be weak. You may not believe that's true, but let me illustrate it.
[time=2388] It's almost without exception. When I go to minister to someone who is sorrowing because of a lost loved one, or has had some bad news about a disease or a sickness, and I walk into their room and begin to talk to them and they cry.
[time=2405] You know what they do? They say, "Pastor forgive me for crying. Forgive me for my tears. Why should I do that? Why should I forgive them for crying? Is it wrong?
[time=2417] Is it a sin? Is it weakness? Is there something wrong with a person who uses that God-given ventilation for the emotion?" Absolutely not.
[time=2432] And when Jesus cried, he demonstrated that it's all right to cry. He, according to Isaiah 53 in the Old Testament, was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[time=2445] And it is very interesting to me that though you can comb the pages of the Gospels for any indication that the Lord ever laughed and never find it, even though on occasion you have to believe that he must have laughed by what he said.
[time=2461] Three separate times in the New Testament we are told that Jesus wept. On an occasion outside of the city of Jerusalem in Luke 1941 we read of it.
[time=2474] The Bible says that when he was come near and he beheld the city and we read into that verse all that we understand about it and knowing in his own heart what was to become of that city in their rejection of Christ.
[time=2486] The Scripture says that he stood on the brow of the hill outside of that city and he beheld the city and he wept and lamented for its future.
[time=2497] In Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 7 we have Paul's commentary on what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane when our Lord there wrestled with the Father over his impending death upon the cross.
[time=2512] And Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 7 says it this way who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications now listen with strong crying and tears unto him who was able to save him from death.
[time=2530] The Lord Jesus wanted so desperately for us to know that it was all right to respond emotionally to the hurts and agonies of life that on three separate occasions he allowed the tears to flow.
[time=2546] And as you study the New Testament even here in this context we read of Mary weeping and of the Jews weeping and of Martha weeping and most of you remember the story of the Apostle Peter when he denied the Lord.
[time=2558] And finally having denied Christ the overwhelming significance of what he did came down upon him and the Scripture says he went out and he wept bitterly.
[time=2568] In the 20th chapter of the book of Acts there is the story of the Ephesian elders who having met Paul in my lead us and hearing from his lips that they would see his face no more the Scripture says they fell upon his neck and they wept.
[time=2589] It's all right to have emotion it's all right.
[time=2596] If you want a good illustration of where we have come historically go sometime to a museum and walk through the hallways of the museum looking at all of the art from the early days of the church and you will see pictured there in the great paintings of the great artist.
[time=2614] Pictures of the suffering and agony and death of Christ you will see him hanging on the cross you will see him with the with a thorn crown brow you will see him in all of his agony and suffering.
[time=2626] And then move from that historical period into the present day modern art and there you see Jesus the teacher Jesus the example Jesus the great leader.
[time=2635] But the agony and emotion that is so much a part of the New Testament record has been passed over in favor of a more dialectical Jesus a more placid Jesus a more unemotional Savior.
[time=2650] And what has happened in our understanding of Christ is being played out in the ministry of the church.
[time=2657] We are going through right now in the state of Indiana what has been affectionately called who's your hysteria.
[time=2664] And if you have never been a part of that you don't understand that term but if you live in Indiana and you ever go to one of those places where they do that you will understand what we're talking about.
[time=2675] And intellectually sophisticated men and women who have all of the benefits of the graces of what it means to be in the upper crust.
[time=2686] Go out to those places where they play that silly game and they get so caught up emotionally in who's your hysteria that you would think if you were from some other culture that they had lost their senses.
[time=2699] They scream and they holler and they jump up and down and they grown men jump up on each other and hug each other.
[time=2709] I saw a grown man kiss another grown man right on television and they get up on ladders and cut nets down and they do all kinds of crazy things.
[time=2719] It is hysteria and then they come to church on Sunday and they sit in their straight pews jam down in their skin and they won't say a word for you see it's not right to be emotional if you're a Christian.
[time=2734] You've got to be straight worship liturgical I heard a story about an old fellow who walked by accident into a high church.
[time=2746] He wasn't one of those kind of folks he was like us you know just sort of simple informal and he sat down not knowing what was going on in an old fellow got up in a long flowing robe and ascended into the pulpit and began to preach.
[time=2760] And he sat there taking it all in and all of a sudden quite by accident the preacher said something good about Jesus.
[time=2766] And this fellow got so excited he shouted right out loud amen and the preacher forgot his message.
[time=2776] And he stumbled around trying to find out where he was in his presentation and all of a sudden he recovered again and got back on track and he started going down toward the conclusion again and again quite by accident he stumbled on a good truth about Jesus.
[time=2789] And this time the old boy said praise the Lord and usher made his way around back from the church up to where he was seated in the pew and he got down next to him and he said sir shut up your bother in our preacher.
[time=2803] He said but I was just praising the Lord he said you can't praise the Lord in this church.
[time=2809] He said but you don't understand I've got religion he said well you didn't get it here so shut up.
[time=2819] And that's the way it is in a lot of churches is it not you come and you sit so straight laced and once in a while in our church we have sort of a half hearted amen somebody gets carried away just a little bit and I watch people look around you know to see what's wrong with that fellow.
[time=2835] You go right ahead if you fill an amen coming and say it out loud and I'll take care of whoever reacts to you it won't be a problem at all.
[time=2844] Jesus was emotional.
[time=2847] Now I'm not saying we need to create emotional frenzy I'm saying it's all right to respond emotionally.
[time=2854] That's what Jesus teaches us when we read in the book that he wept.
[time=2859] Now thirdly when Jesus wept he teaches us his humanity he teaches us his humility and he teaches us his sympathy.
[time=2870] Why did Jesus weep?
[time=2873] Why did he do that?
[time=2875] Well did Jesus weep because Lazarus was dead?
[time=2881] That's impossible.
[time=2884] He knew that Lazarus would be alive in a few moments he didn't weep because he was dead.
[time=2888] I suggested last week maybe he maybe he wept because Lazarus is going to have to come back into this world having gone to the other world and knowing what was all there Jesus wept because he had to come back here.
[time=2898] If he wept then he really would have wept if he had to come back in our world today.
[time=2903] Did Jesus weep because Mary wept and Martha wept and the people wept did he not likewise know that they would be shouting for joy and praising God in a few moments?
[time=2913] Absolutely.
[time=2914] Why then did he weep?
[time=2917] Jesus wept because he was a sympathetic Christ and in the death of Lazarus and in the tears of Mary and of Martha and the crowd Jesus I am confident saw the tears of the ages.
[time=2932] The tears which Adam's sin has brought to all of us he saw it all and he wept he wept because the death of Lazarus was a picture of his own impending death that would be necessary in order that the tears of all mankind might be dealt with.
[time=2956] In those tears that he shed are all of the Agonies and the sorrows that one day he would experience in our behalf.
[time=2966] And when I read that and when there comes at times into my own life the kind of agony that would cause the tears to come the kind of inner conflict or sorrow or difficulty.
[time=2978] Somehow I feel like I'm closer to God because the one who is between God and me the one mediator between God and man is a man who one day cried.
[time=2990] And I feel like I can go and talk with him and you know that's exactly what the scripture wants us to understand.
[time=2996] For it says in the book of Hebrews now listen for verily he took not on him the nature of angels aren't you glad Jesus wasn't an angel.
[time=3008] He took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham therefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren
[time=3020] that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
[time=3030] What does that mean? It means that Jesus was poured into a human body complete with tear ducts.
[time=3038] So that as he experienced life in this world for those 33 years that he walked among flesh and as he responded to the crises and difficulties of his day
[time=3049] he could so respond as humanity responds and share with us a beautiful invitation that we might come boldly before the throne of grace for we have there a high priest who understands what we experience and he does.
[time=3066] In the Old Testament there are countless words of encouragement and illustration concerning our Lord's knowledge of our sorrow.
[time=3078] For instance if you were to turn back in the Bible to the book of 2 Kings in chapter 20 you'd read about Hezekiah we don't have time to do it in our service today.
[time=3091] King Hezekiah violated the holiness of God and death was pronounced upon him and the scripture says that the king cried out to God in prayer and he shed tears
[time=3102] and the Bible says that the Lord saw his tears and communicated to him through the prophet that his life had been extended for 15 years.
[time=3112] In the Old Testament book of Job where we have that overwhelming record of the sorrowful Job we are reminded over and over again in that book that God saw and understood and heard the cries of the Old Testament patriarch.
[time=3135] But I suppose the best and greatest encouragement in all of the Bible concerning our Lord and our God and His compassion for us is found in Psalm chapter 56 and verse 8.
[time=3150] And if you have your Bibles and you can find the Old Testament book of Psalms would you turn there in closing and join with me in thinking through what is in this verse.
[time=3164] Psalm chapter 56 and verse 8.
[time=3167] Here the Psalmist records these words and you ought to underline it in your Bible.
[time=3173] Thou rememberst or numberst my wanderings.
[time=3177] Put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book.
[time=3184] Did you know that up in heaven there is a place where God has a bottle of your tears?
[time=3192] Did you know that?
[time=3194] You say pastor is that really true is that literally true in my understanding of the text.
[time=3202] The psalmist is using this picture to teach God's knowledge of the sorrows and difficulties of our life.
[time=3210] Whether it is a literal bottle with our tears is not the issue the issue is that God takes note of your sorrows and those sorrows are so precious in his sight.
[time=3221] And he is so concerned about your need that the Scripture uses this picture to teach us how precious and important to God in heaven are the sorrows of your life.
[time=3234] He stores up your sorrows in a bottle and he remembers them in his book.
[time=3244] And the Bible says that's the kind of Lord we have.
[time=3250] I feel like I could almost touch him and almost reach out and grab hold of him when I come to a passage like this.
[time=3261] He is like me because he chose apart from sin to be made like unto sinful flesh that he might identify with us and we with him.
[time=3276] Could I tell you something won't always be like that?
[time=3279] No, there's coming a day when he will not do that anymore.
[time=3285] You know why? Because way back yonder in the book of Revelation it says that when we step on that golden shore, God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes and never again will we know sorrow.
[time=3303] But in the meantime, while we're between here and there, walking through the valley of the shadow of death and the tears and struggles that cause us to groan waiting for the redemption,
[time=3314] there is a high priest in heaven who understands and who cares.
[time=3320] And when you pray to him sometimes with the tears just dripping down your face, you don't have to be ashamed.
[time=3328] You don't have to apologize. All you need to do is say, "Lord, you understand I know. Shall we pray together?"
[time=3339] As we bow in prayer, if you do not know the Christ about whom I have spoken, wouldn't you like to know him today?
[time=3346] He comes right now to knock at your hearts door asking you to accept him as your Savior.
[time=3352] Simply ask him into your life and into your heart, ask him to be your Savior, and he will come in.
[time=3358] He will come in today to be your Lord. If you will ask him to forgive your sin, he will become your Savior.
[time=3365] When you do that, please let us know here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church that we might help you in your growth,
[time=3372] that you might get established in your walk with Christ. God loves you, and God bless you for making your decision for him through Christ today.

[time=3496] When a leader leaves a ministry, there are many thoughts that go through his mind and heart.
[time=3505] One of the things that has just totally occupied me during these days when I have sent God's direction to me and to my family, to the West Coast, has been a preoccupation with the ministry here.
