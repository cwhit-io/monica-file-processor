[time=28] (singing in foreign language) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour with Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=42] (singing in foreign language)
[time=59] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=62] - We're happy to welcome you to this service today.
[time=68] Such a good crowd here for the summertime.
[time=71] This is our second morning service at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=75] And I suppose this is a very special one in some respects for us.
[time=79] It's the last service we will share together as a congregation through the television and the television and the television.
[time=86] And I'm so appreciative to all who have planned the music and the rest of this service to make it very special.
[time=93] The choir is singing my very favorite hymn, and they are doing it in a very special way.
[time=99] And I hope you'll listen as under the direction of Don Kruger, they share with us the beautiful hymn, "It is Well" with my soul.
[time=107] (gentle music)
[time=116] (singing in foreign language) [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=344] - Thank you, Choir.
[time=357] I haven't heard that song ever sung any better than that and I appreciate it so much.
[time=362] These times when we go through changes in our lives require a great deal from all of us.
[time=370] And sometimes the difficulties and the troubles and the burdens seem more than we can handle.
[time=377] But isn't it good to know as Marilyn is going to share with us in music that when the difficulties get multiplied, they can never keep up with the multiplication of God's grace for all of us.
[time=391] No matter what the situation might be, God always gives us more grace than we need if we just trust Him for it.
[time=399] Listen to the words of this beautiful song as Marilyn Wong sings for us.
[time=403] He giveeth more grace.
[time=405] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=571] He give earth and give earth and give earth again.
[time=601] We're so happy to have you with us today and especially on this program which is the last television program that the Jeremiah family will share with you.
[time=611] Over the years that we've been on television together we've taken the opportunity at special times during the year to have our family sit together and share with us in this special time because we really believe in the family and we've discovered through the things that we've heard back from people in the mail that they enjoy getting acquainted with our families and that right now.
[time=630] That's right, we always have a lot of letters and we have the children on from the older folks who miss having children in their home and it's just delightful for them to share in our family.
[time=641] Before we say some things as a family to all of you we want to take just a moment to express our appreciation to each and every one of you who have had a part in the Bible, our ministry.
[time=651] I want to say thank you in general to all of you who have supported us over these years. You have made it possible for us to have this ministry during the time that we have been here.
[time=662] And I know that you will continue to support the ministry after we're gone but we want to say for ourselves how much we appreciate all of you who've been a part of this family.
[time=673] Not only are we a family as the Jeremiah's but the Bible hours of family and we thank you for what you've done.
[time=680] And we especially want to thank all of you who have had a part in our recent fundraising drive to leave the Bible hour ministry debt free for the new man who comes in to take over.
[time=692] And so many of you have really sacrificed in order to make this a possibility and we just want to let you know how very much we appreciate it.
[time=701] Now I think if we're going to have any hope of getting any sense out of the rest of this time together we better ask the questions we're going to ask and let the children have their part.
[time=710] We're going to start first of all with Daniel who's sitting over here on Donna's lap.
[time=714] Daniel you tell these people where we're moving to okay.
[time=717] California.
[time=718] Say it again.
[time=719] California.
[time=721] It's almost harder to say than Indiana isn't it.
[time=724] Okay and Jennifer this summer here in Fort Wayne you've had fun playing a special sport.
[time=730] What has that sport been?
[time=731] Tea ball.
[time=732] Are you hoping to do that some more?
[time=734] Yeah.
[time=735] Do they have that out in California?
[time=736] Yeah.
[time=737] You going to play it?
[time=738] I don't know.
[time=739] You don't know huh.
[time=740] Did you ever hit the ball when you played tea ball?
[time=742] Yeah.
[time=743] And you ran fast too didn't you?
[time=744] Uh huh.
[time=745] Okay.
[time=746] Well everybody's looking forward to the sports in California and I know David not only are you looking forward to participating but there's something else you're pretty excited about.
[time=753] What's that?
[time=754] You being you being the chaplain of the Chargers.
[time=757] They would have an devotion with them every week.
[time=760] What does that have to do with you?
[time=762] I hate to eat their autograph.
[time=766] You may see a long time Dallas Cowboy fan gradually change into a San Diego Charger fan.
[time=772] I'm not sure if that's true but David is right when he says that I'm going to have opportunity to have some of the devotional responsibilities for the San Diego Charger football team and I'm excited about it.
[time=782] Jan you've had a long time dream that might come true in California.
[time=787] What's that?
[time=788] Well I'd really like to have a horse and a lot of people do have horses out in California so I'm hoping I'll get one.
[time=794] It really is a strange thing to drive down the street in California and about every third house or so has a horse out back so maybe we can pull that off.
[time=801] We hope we can.
[time=802] You have some mixed emotions about leaving don't you honey?
[time=805] Yeah I want to go out and live in California because it's really nice but I don't want to leave all my friends and I know that I'll meet new friends out there.
[time=814] Well I think all of us feel that way.
[time=816] We don't want to leave our friends but we want to be faithful to what God has called us to do and we know that as we leave the Bible hour here and the friends that we've made in this area we'll make many new friends where we're going to go and God will use us there as he has here if we're faithful to him.
[time=834] And we also know that he has a plan for the Bible hour here.
[time=837] God is not a God of confusion and when he begins a ministry and puts the foundation down it is in order that it might grow.
[time=845] It may take a different approach and a different attack but I want to promise you that the folks I know here in this church who have been a part of the Bible hour ministry are committed to its continuance and are praying daily for God's direction as they seek a man who will be following us here.
[time=862] We are teaching and preaching the Word of God on the air each week and in the meantime he has a wonderful plan for the interim.
[time=869] Pastor Rick Hawks one of the young men on our staff here will be preaching the Word of God on a regular basis and interspersed between his messages will be messages from some of the really good preachers in our country who will come to share the Word of God with you.
[time=885] I know that you'll be faithful in these days which are very important to this ministry as you have faithfully supported us while we've been here.
[time=892] I know that especially during the interim you'll be in prayer and very very conscious of the importance of your financial support during the interim time.
[time=902] We love you and we thank you for what you've done to help us preach the gospel to this community.
[time=908] May God bless you each one as you continue to serve him. We look forward to the day when we shall share in the glad reunion the Lord has prepared for all those who love him and there will never be any goodbyes again.
[time=921] Until then we hope that you will continue to be a part of what God is doing here.
[time=938] There is peace and contentment in my Father's house today.
[time=958] Lots of food on his table and no one is turned away.
[time=967] There is singing when laughter as the hours pass by but a hush.
[time=978] Comes the singing as the Father sadly cries.
[time=990] My house is full but my field is empty.
[time=999] Who will go and work for me today?
[time=1007] It's since my children all want to stay around my table but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1026] No one wants to work in my field.
[time=1039] Push away from the table through the window pane just beyond the house of plenty.
[time=1052] Eyes of field of golden rain and it's white unto harvest but the rebirths.
[time=1064] Where are they in the house?
[time=1069] Oh, can the children hear the Father sadly say?
[time=1078] Oh, my house is full but my field is empty.
[time=1089] Who will go and work for me today?
[time=1098] It's since my children all want to stay around my table but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1118] No one wants to work in my field.
[time=1139] Thank you ladies for ministering to us like that strictly feminine singers.
[time=1144] I suppose if I have a favorite kind of music it isn't a secret to most of you.
[time=1150] I have been a quartet fan for many many years.
[time=1154] I love male quartet music and some of you remember back in the early days here I used to sing in a quartet.
[time=1163] And I don't do that anymore because people used to come out of the church after I got done singing and say,
[time=1171] Minister, you ought to sing more and preach less.
[time=1174] And I never knew how to take that so I just quit singing.
[time=1177] Anyway, we love our quartet and we have a great one here.
[time=1182] They're the equal to any quartet I've ever heard.
[time=1185] And we're just so privileged to have them and they're going to sing before the message this morning, the men's quartet.
[time=1192] [MUSIC]
[time=1199] No one understands like Jesus.
[time=1207] He's a friend beyond compare.
[time=1215] You can be him at the throne of mercy.
[time=1224] He is waiting for you there.
[time=1234] No one understands like Jesus, Jesus.
[time=1243] When the days are dark and greasy or green.
[time=1252] No one is so near, so dear as Jesus.
[time=1262] As your every stare on here.
[time=1276] No one understands like Jesus.
[time=1285] When the foes of life are saved.
[time=1292] You should never be discouraged.
[time=1301] Jesus cares and will not fail.
[time=1312] No one understands like Jesus.
[time=1320] When the days are dark and greasy or green.
[time=1329] No one is so near, so dear as Jesus.
[time=1339] As your every care.
[time=1344] Cast your every care on here.
[time=1363] Thank you men for singing for us today and let's open our Bibles this morning to the 20th chapter of the Book of Acts, Acts 20.
[time=1381] I'm reading today from the Word of God the 20th chapter of Acts beginning at the 17th verse and reading through the end of the chapter.
[time=1391] Acts 20 verses 17 through the end of the chapter.
[time=1397] You follow in your Bibles as I read from mine from God's holy word.
[time=1402] And from my leaders Paul sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church.
[time=1407] And when they were come to him he said unto them, "You know that from the first day that I came into Asia,
[time=1413] after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and trials which be fell me by the laying in weight of the Jews.
[time=1424] How I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shown you and have taught you publicly and from house to house,
[time=1430] testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1438] And now behold I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
[time=1451] But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[time=1466] And now behold I know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more.
[time=1473] Wherefore I testify unto you this day that I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
[time=1483] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over whom the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers,
[time=1489] to feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this that after mighty parting shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock.
[time=1499] Also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.
[time=1505] Therefore watch and remember that for the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears.
[time=1514] And now brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified.
[time=1523] I have coveted no man silver or gold or a peril. Yay you yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me.
[time=1532] I have shown you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive.
[time=1543] And when he had thus spoken he knelt down and prayed with them all and they all wept much and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship shall we pray.
[time=1562] Our Lord this holy book which we study together is a book for all seasons.
[time=1570] There is a word here for us at each experience of life and we're so grateful that we don't have to depend in such an hour as this upon our own words what we might conjure up to say.
[time=1585] But we can come to the word of God and there we have an example for us for this very situation which is before us this morning.
[time=1593] Let the word of God be instructive encouraging and strengthening to our hearts and lives.
[time=1599] And may it be that which we will cling to during these moments and in these days for we pray in Jesus name and for his sake, amen.
[time=1611] I suppose in some measure I have dreaded this hour most of all of the experiences that we have had during these recent days.
[time=1621] And one of the reasons that I have not looked forward to it is I wasn't exactly sure what I would say, what I would preach.
[time=1631] I thought about all of the messages I know of in the Bible the words of the men in the Bible, their last words.
[time=1639] I thought of the words of Joshua and of Moses and of David and I almost preached some thoughts from those texts until it suddenly dawned on me that these were the last words these men spoke before they died.
[time=1654] And I wasn't exactly sure I wanted anything to be quite that final.
[time=1659] And then I remembered the words which were written in the book of Acts concerning Paul's instruction to the Ephesians not before he died but before he went on to do something else God had called him to do and I said that's it.
[time=1672] That's where we ought to focus our attention today because that's very appropriate for the situation which is ours this morning.
[time=1681] Now when Paul spoke to the Ephesian elders who were the folks who knew him best and loved him most in all of the ministry which God gave him he chose to do it in three ways.
[time=1691] First of all he spent some time reviewing the past and then a little time assessing the present and thirdly he spent a few moments preparing them for the future and that's what I want to do today.
[time=1703] First of all to review the past and I promise you not to put on the clothing of nostalgia and go back through all of the great experiences we have had here for the hour is not long enough for that.
[time=1714] But it is important for us to take a chapter from Paul's life and from his testimony and kind of review our ministry with Paul's outline as our pattern.
[time=1727] I want to be sure no one misunderstands this for I do not even in my wildest imagination compare myself to Paul nor do I want my ministry laid down alongside of his.
[time=1740] That would be a very sobering experience to say the least but Paul has some things to say about his experience with the Ephesians that are very appropriate for us to consider today and I want to do that.
[time=1751] As he reviewed the past there were several things that focused in upon his mind that are certainly true of mine.
[time=1758] First of all in the first verse in verse 19 Paul reminds the Ephesian elders that his whole ministry has been categorized with this participial phrase serving the Lord.
[time=1774] Paul understood what all of us come to understand either by revelation or by experience and that is that if you go into the work of God to do anything other than to serve the Lord you're in for some big disappointments.
[time=1789] That old phrase that says you can please some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you'll never please all of the people all of the time is probably best known to ministers of the gospel.
[time=1801] For you soon learn that no matter what you say or what you do there will always be certain people who won't understand it who will misunderstand it who will purposefully not like it.
[time=1812] And so if you're in the business of the pastorate to please people you don't stay very long and I've secretly wondered if the reason we have such great attrition in the ministry is not due to the fact that some men go into the ministry with the wrong focus.
[time=1827] Thinking that somehow their success or failure is judged by the acclaim response and acceptance of people.
[time=1834] Paul understood early on that his ministry was a ministry of serving the Lord.
[time=1840] Last week when we spoke about the judgment seat of Christ I reminded you that all of our lives are to be lived as if we were one player on a stage performing for one person in the audience.
[time=1853] We were to live our lives as if we were one participant in a game performing before one spectator in the stands.
[time=1861] And that spectator and that person in the audience was God himself and of God shall all men receive praise.
[time=1870] Paul said I came to you and for three years I have been here serving the Lord.
[time=1876] And I want you to know that that's what's kept me going in these years and focuses in my mind as I look to the years ahead.
[time=1884] Someone said to me the other day you're going to be serving a new congregation and I wanted to correct them immediately.
[time=1890] No I'm serving the same Lord he's just moved me to a new location.
[time=1894] We serve the Lord Christ and it's important to understand that.
[time=1898] And Paul said as I look back on my ministry with you who are the Ephesian elders I want you to notice up front
[time=1905] that my ministry has been a ministry of serving the Lord.
[time=1908] But he does not leave reality in the wings.
[time=1913] He is very careful to point out realistically what serving the Lord involves.
[time=1917] For in the very next breath he mentions that serving the Lord involves shouldering the problems with many tears and in many trials he said.
[time=1926] Sometimes people get the idea that if you're serving the Lord everything just goes alright.
[time=1931] But I want to tell you the best way I know to get yourself in a whole lot of trouble is to serve the Lord.
[time=1936] If you do you can I can promise you you'll have many trials you'll have many tears and you'll have many many times of discouragement.
[time=1943] Paul did not try to gloss over his ministry.
[time=1947] Later on he reminds the Ephesians that night and day with tears he warned them of the coming danger that would be theirs after his departure.
[time=1957] The ministry is a glorious calling and as I look back over the years of ministry here many wonderful things have happened.
[time=1964] But I want you to know though it may not be obvious always in the pulpit there have been times of great trial and many tears.
[time=1970] Difficulties which we have faced together.
[time=1973] I think back upon a time when we went through a doctrinal cleansing that could have split this church wide open.
[time=1980] And I know the tears that we went through during that time because it touched the lives of people.
[time=1985] If you're in the ministry serving the Lord you will also be responsible to shoulder the problems.
[time=1991] And the age old adage that says if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen is applicable to every man I know who's in the ministry.
[time=1999] And I want to promise you it is not a matter of geography it's a matter of reality there are problems in the ministry there always will be.
[time=2008] He was a man who was serving the Lord as he reviewed the past and shouldering the problems but he seems to focus in on this priority he was a man who was sharing the truth.
[time=2018] It says in verse 20 that Paul kept back nothing that was profitable unto the Ephesians.
[time=2026] And then down in verse 27 he says it again in a little different language he says I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole gospel or the whole counsel of God.
[time=2037] When Paul talks about sharing the truth the first thing he focuses in on is this he shared the truth completely.
[time=2045] He didn't leave anything out he let it all be spoken whenever he spoke he shared the truth in its totality.
[time=2053] As I've looked back over our ministry here I've had to ask myself the question now Jeremiah be honest is there anything that you haven't preached on that you should have
[time=2062] or anything that you came to in the word of God that you were going to preach on and you passed over it and I can honestly say I don't believe there has been.
[time=2070] There have been some folks in this congregation who have tried to get me to do a series on divorce and remarriage and that I have refused to do but that is not shunning to declare the whole counsel of God that's just a matter of good sense.
[time=2082] I just determined not to do that because there is a great deal of diversity of opinion and it could have been more divisive than it could have been unifying and most of you all know what my position on that is anyway.
[time=2093] But Paul said as I look back on my life in ministry I haven't kept back anything from you in the vernacular of today we can say it without being irreverent Paul said I let it all hang out man you saw it all when I got done preaching it was all laying on the table.
[time=2108] Now men and women there are some ministries today where that's not true.
[time=2112] Francis Schaeffer in one of his books talks about certain ministry being like a man who walks into a goods store and when he asks for a certain good the proprietor says oh my yes that's what we specialize in and he reaches out and from under the counter he lays the goods on top.
[time=2131] He says that's our specialty that's what we do and he sells the goods and Schaeffer goes on to say that that man leaves and the goods are all put back under the counter again and another man comes in asking for something diametrically opposed to what the first man requested
[time=2144] and Schaeffer says he says oh yes that's our specialty and he reaches out from under the counter and he puts it up on top.
[time=2150] There are many churches like that that try to be all things to all men and they are always candy coating the truth depending on who they are speaking to Paul said in my ministry I put all the goods up on the counter you could see it all it was right there.
[time=2163] He didn't leave anything out as God is my witness that has been my purpose and that has been what I have tried to do Paul said he shared the truth completely but I want you to notice secondly and this is even more amazing for a man like Paul for a period of time of three years
[time=2179] to be able to say this in the inspired Word of God not only did he share the truth completely he shared the truth consistently or continually.
[time=2188] In my Bible I have a line drawn from verse 18 to verse 26 it is a wonderful truth and a very convicting truth and I'd like to ask you to follow with me as you do that in your own Bible.
[time=2201] Paul said in verse 18 when they were come to him he said unto them you know that from the first day that I came.
[time=2208] Now you got that underlined the first day now draw that line down to verse 26 and notice what he says in verse 26.
[time=2215] Wherefore I testify unto you this day Paul said from the first day to this day I have continued to do exactly what I set out to do when I came to minister to the Ephesians.
[time=2230] In our first service we had a former pro football player who I've come to know in this city a young man by the name of John Gantt.
[time=2237] And I've said to John a number of times what is it that makes greatness in football and he said it isn't the guy who makes the big play one day it's the guy who makes the big play every day.
[time=2247] The guy who can always be there always the same week in and week out never changing.
[time=2253] And Paul said my ministry in the Word of God has been a ministry of consistency holding up the same truth week in and week out.
[time=2263] Folks I know as I think back over my ministry here there have been times when I have really blown it as a pastor.
[time=2273] Somebody said to me you know when you go to a new church you can preach all your old sermons again.
[time=2277] I said are you kidding when I see some of the sermons I preached it makes me so sick I can't hardly stand it.
[time=2283] I'm going to bury them I'm going to start fresh I don't want any of the old stuff.
[time=2288] I know I may not have always done it as well as it can be done but there's one thing I know never once since the day we had our first service in the trailer.
[time=2296] Have I ever attempted to change the message?
[time=2300] The message is the Word of God salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone.
[time=2306] Paul said as I look back I want to tell you something from the first day until this day we have preached the whole council of God.
[time=2314] Then he goes on to say that not only did he share the truth completely and consistently or continually but he shared the truth convincingly.
[time=2323] I can't imagine the Apostle Paul preaching for anything less than a verdict.
[time=2328] Do you know sometimes today we get the impression that the church is a place where we come and sit to be lectured to and after we amass all of this wonderful truth we close our notebooks and we walk out the door.
[time=2340] But I want you to notice what Paul says about his preaching.
[time=2343] He says in verse 21 I preached repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2350] He says in verse 24 the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus is a ministry of testifying of witnessing to the gospel of the grace of God.
[time=2360] Over and over again in this text he uses strong words of intensity for communication to teach, to declare, to testify.
[time=2369] Paul preached with authority not for information but for a verdict for a decision.
[time=2376] Just about every time I fail to give an invitation in this church in response to what I preached somebody comes up to me to remind me that that was the service when they were going to make their decision.
[time=2386] I believe God has done that specifically to encourage me to be very sensitive about ever preaching in such a way as to not allow folks to make a decision about what we've said.
[time=2395] And you know it's a wonderful and amazing thing you can preach to the saints and the sinners get saved and you can preach to the sinners and the saints get built up.
[time=2404] And I don't understand it but I know that in the preaching ministry of Paul as I read the things that he preached Paul preached with intensity and he preached in such a way that you couldn't sit there without doing something about what he had said.
[time=2420] I think that's biblical preaching. No wonder Paul was excited as he looked back.
[time=2425] So Paul says as I review the past here are the things that come to my mind.
[time=2429] Number one serving the Lord, number two, shouldering the problems, number three, sharing the truth, but number four, showing the way.
[time=2437] I want you to notice twice in this text Paul talks about things he showed the Ephesians.
[time=2445] Verse 20, "I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shown you," he said.
[time=2452] Turn over in your Bibles to verse 35, "I have shown you all things."
[time=2458] Now it's one thing to teach, it's quite something else to show.
[time=2463] To example, to model Paul said I wasn't just convinced that it was a matter of speaking the truth, it was a matter of living the truth, of modeling the truth, of showing you what to do.
[time=2474] He goes on and in verse 18 he says, "You know what manner of man I have been among you all."
[time=2481] Paul said, "Not only am I talking about my lips, I'm talking about my life." Paul was astute enough as a Christian leader to understand there are some things you cannot teach people by speaking to them.
[time=2494] There are some things you have to teach them by showing them.
[time=2497] I remember the early ministry that we had in this church as we tried to teach people how to be evangelists.
[time=2504] And we would speak on it and talk about it and preach on it and people go home watch TV.
[time=2509] And nobody was getting saved.
[time=2511] Do you know how it got started?
[time=2512] It got started when God taught me the importance of it.
[time=2515] And then I put my arm around a brother and took him out and showed him how to do it.
[time=2520] The ministry of the gospel is not so much what we say as it is what we are.
[time=2526] And Paul said, "I showed you these things." Now I want you to notice the areas of his exemplified life that are touched upon in this text.
[time=2533] First of all, he showed them by his public preaching.
[time=2536] He said publicly.
[time=2537] He showed them by his private teaching and house to house.
[time=2541] He showed them by his personal stewardship over in verse 33 as he talks about showing them about life.
[time=2548] He says, "I have coveted no man silver or gold or apparel, but I have constantly reminded you of the words of the Lord Jesus that it is more blessed to give than to receive."
[time=2561] One of the things that I've been excited about this last week is the release of a new book that just came out authored by Elmer Towns and David Seifert and another fellow that I don't know.
[time=2570] It's a book on church growth.
[time=2572] This week the brethren convention was at Winona Lake and Dave Seifert who's a pastor in the brethren movement brought a book over and gave it to me.
[time=2579] I was just leafing through it the other night.
[time=2581] And it's one of these books of lists which I'm never too impressed with.
[time=2584] The 100 largest churches in the 100 largest Sunday schools in the 100, you know.
[time=2588] And I was just leafing through that book and it shows all of the top 100 churches in terms of Sunday school attendance and the top 100 churches in terms of church attendance.
[time=2600] The top 100 churches in terms of Sunday school enrollment and the top 100 churches in terms of financial stewardship.
[time=2608] Well, I want to tell you something folks.
[time=2610] We didn't make the 100 top attendance churches.
[time=2616] We didn't make the top 100 church attendance churches, but we did make the top 100 stewardship churches.
[time=2623] In this great land of ours, this church is one of the 100 churches that gives more money to the cause of Christ and other churches in the land.
[time=2632] You say pastor, if that's true, how could we be in such bad shape?
[time=2635] Well, we're in the lower 50.
[time=2641] We need to get into top 50.
[time=2643] That's the problem, you see.
[time=2645] But you know how that happened? That happened through the example of the leadership in the church, through the deacons, through the pastor, through the staff, believing in giving and not being afraid to stand up and share by way of testimony that that's how God blesses us when we're faithful in stewardship.
[time=2668] The personal example Paul said that he exemplified the truth by his life in public preaching, in private teaching, in personal stewardship, and then the last one in persistent labor.
[time=2683] Notice what he says in verse 35.
[time=2687] He says, I have shown you all things, how that's so laboring you want to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord.
[time=2696] You know, Paul had a built in way of teaching that truth, laboring with his own hands.
[time=2702] He wasn't paid necessarily by the church, but he was a tent maker and he went out and labored in the world, in the secular market, and he earned money, and then on top of all of that he gave himself completely to the work of God.
[time=2716] Paul was really two full-time men wrapped up into one.
[time=2720] He was a full-time man in the ministry, and in many respects he labored with his hands as a full-time employer, like many of you folks.
[time=2727] I've often said to you that the most motivating factor in my own life as a pastor is the reality, in my mind of this truth, that everything you do for the cause of Christ as lay people is done over and above a 40 to 50 to 60 hour work week.
[time=2744] And I determined when I came here that there'd be no man in this church who would work harder at what he did in the world than what I did in the service of God.
[time=2753] I didn't want anybody getting up earlier than I did or staying up later than I did to make money in the world when God had called us to the highest calling that is available to any person, and that is the ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2767] And I think Paul was like that. He says, "You know how I worked, laboring with my hands, supporting the weak and ministering the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[time=2777] So as Paul reviewed the past he talked about serving the Lord and shouldering the problems and sharing the truth and showing the way, and some of those things are exciting to me.
[time=2787] Paul said something in this text that just blew me away the first time I read it. He said, "As I look at my life at the end of this ministry, verse 26, I testify that I am pure from the blood of all men."
[time=2803] Wow. Paul, how could you say that? How could you say that and it be included in the inspired Word of God? And I wondered how could anybody be pure from the blood of all men? And God reminded me of a passage in the book of Ezekiel.
[time=2815] And it says this, "When I say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou giveest him not the warning nor speakest to the wicked and warn him of his way to save his life."
[time=2827] That same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood shall I require at your hand. And then he goes on in Ezekiel and he says, "But if the wicked man dies in his sin and you've warned him, then you are free from his blood. You've delivered your soul."
[time=2842] I could not help but think about the fact that men and women who have come into this church week after week and week after week who are lost and in sin will never be able to stand before the great white throne judgment of God when God speaks to them
[time=2856] and consigns them to eternity apart from Christ and say, "I went to that church down there in Fort Wayne and they never told me because men and women we have told them over and over and over and over again. We have warned them that there's only one way that a person gets to heaven and that's by faith in Jesus Christ and his shed blood upon the cross, that there is no other way, that is the way, the truth in the life, Jesus Christ."
[time=2880] As Paul looked back on his life, he says, "Listen, I've been with you three years and I want to tell you something I'm pure from the blood of all men. There may be some folks who came to services where it wasn't clear. There may have been times when it's been delivered in the flesh, but I want to tell you something, no one who's come to this church regularly will ever be able to stand before God and say, "That man preached, but I didn't know how I could know Christ."
[time=2905] And that's a good feeling to walk out of here knowing that the gospel has been made plain. I want to tell you something one more time and I want you to listen to me carefully, my friend, if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, if you don't ask Him for forgiveness of your sin, get on to your face before Him and ask Him to forgive your sin and accept Christ as your Savior and Lord, you will die and go to a Christless hell for eternity. That's the Word of God.
[time=2933] And once you have heard that, you are never, ever free from the responsibility to do something about it.
[time=2940] Paul said, "I'm pure from the blood of all men. Now, that's the past. Then He says is the present. I want you to think about the present."
[time=2947] Three times in this text Paul says, "Now, now," he says, "and everybody's interested in them.
[time=2952] Now, that's the past that's over. Let's talk about now." First of all, in verses 22 and 23, he talks about the announcement of his departure.
[time=2961] "And now," he said, "behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there."
[time=2968] The announcement of his departure, Paul said, "Now, I'm going to Jerusalem and I like the terminology." He said, "I'm going bound in my Spirit." This is not a reference to the Holy Spirit, but a reference to Paul's Spirit.
[time=2979] And he's saying, "I don't have any choice. I am bound in my Spirit to go to Jerusalem."
[time=2985] He's going because he is called of God to do it. He has to do it.
[time=2991] I like the reality of his assessment of this calling.
[time=2996] Couldn't help but think about that this week as I was studying it again. He says, "Now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there."
[time=3005] And I'll tell you something. I'm going bound in the Spirit to San Diego, and I have no idea what kind of trouble I'm going to get into out there.
[time=3013] But Paul said, "There's one thing I'm sure of. I don't know all that's there. I don't know what's going to happen, but I promise you one thing.
[time=3020] The Spirit witnesses in every city, bonds and afflictions. You know something, problems follow you everywhere.
[time=3026] There is no place geographically where you can go to get rid. Like someone said recently to me, some pastor.
[time=3031] He said, "The same old bitty I left at the door when I walked out of that church was waiting for me when I walked into new church.
[time=3037] Just had a different dress on. That's all." Paul said, "When I leave here and I go to Jerusalem, I don't know everything that's going to be there, but I don't want to be some problems there.
[time=3051] You don't run away from problems. In fact, if I know anything at all about the West Coast, they got more in their share."
[time=3058] The announcement of his departure. Then notice the acceptance of Paul's departure.
[time=3065] Now these are hard words, verse 25 he says, "And now behold, here's the second now. And now behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
[time=3077] I hope that isn't true for me. I hope I'll get to come back and see your face and visit you.
[time=3083] But you know I'm glad Paul said that because it gives me an opportunity to say this, "Men and women, when David Jeremiah is gone, he's gone. I want you to hear that now."
[time=3093] Some day there'll be a new pastor here. Don't you ever, ever compare him to David Jeremiah for two reasons.
[time=3099] Number one, that's not fair to him. Number two, I'm going to lose. And I don't like to lose. Don't you do that.
[time=3106] When God raises up a new leader, he's your leader. And if you don't give him the same support and excitement and enthusiastic response that you've given to me, then you're sinning against God.
[time=3116] Don't you call me on the phone out there and say, "Pastor, why do you think about this? I won't talk to you. First, I've got enough problems out there without yours. And it's not right."
[time=3126] Paul said, "Now, I know you're sorry because you're not going to see it. Well, you say, did they get the message? Sometimes you can say, "Well, the pastor's gone, the pastor's gone, and after he's gone, nobody believes it. They still hang on. I want to say to you, you need to let me go."
[time=3145] Well, over in the end of this text, it says that they wept much and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him, sorrowing for the words which he spoke that they should see his face and more. They got the message, didn't they? They heard him. I want you to hear me.
[time=3158] I love this church, and I'm grateful to God for what he's done here, but God's called me someplace else, and he's got somebody else for this place, and when I'm gone, you need to forget about me in terms of leadership and give your allegiance to the man God brings.
[time=3173] That's good instruction.
[time=3178] And then Paul gives him the assurance in his departure in verse 32. He says, "Now, brethren, I commend you to God. There's the third now. And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace which is able to build you up." Can I say this in this way? Listen to me now.
[time=3196] David Jeremiah is gone, but God's still here, right? David Jeremiah is gone, but God's word or the word of His grace is still here.
[time=3206] Isn't it interesting that Paul says that in just that plain language? He says, "Now, listen, I'm going, but I want to remind you of this. God's here, and I commend you to him, and his words here, and I commend you to that.
[time=3219] And what else can you ask?" In the assurance that God would give to His children than this, that when His servant goes, he doesn't go.
[time=3231] And the same God who brought me here is going to bring someone else here, and the same God who authored this book is going to preserve it, and as long as we stay true to it, it will be everything it should be in our lives.
[time=3244] The assessment of the present. Now, we don't have much time for the future, so listen fast. Paul was concerned about three things.
[time=3253] In the future, he was concerned, first of all, about the personal lives of the leadership. He says, "Take heed to yourselves." He's talking to the elders, verse 28.
[time=3263] And he says, "I'm concerned that the personal lives of those in leadership be watched and guarded because men and women, a leader in an interim time whose life isn't right can cause great havoc on the future of any institution."
[time=3275] And so he says, "Take heed to yourselves." Secondly, he was concerned about the perpetuation of the teaching ministry and the flock to whom God has given you that you feed the sheep.
[time=3286] Paul is saying, "While I'm gone, there may be some who will come with some other program than the feeding of the sheep, and don't you let them do it. It's the feeding of the sheep that's going to make the difference."
[time=3296] Finally, Paul was concerned about the potential for problems in the future, and he warns them against the difficulties that can come when leadership is absent.
[time=3308] Individuals grow up to take the responsibility that God has given to the leader.
[time=3315] This is my last sermon. I'm going to finish whether we're done or not, so just listen to y'all quitting when you're done and I'm going to preach.
[time=3322] There are two problems Paul was worried about.
[time=3328] One was the problems that come in the door and the problems that grow up after they're in the door.
[time=3334] If you want to put it this way, he was concerned about the wolves outside of the church and the workers inside of the church.
[time=3340] Now notice what he says.
[time=3342] He says, "I'm concerned about this place, and I want to warn you that after my departure there may be some folks in it."

[time=3530] I have not personally heard him, but I've heard much about him, Rick, and I understand he's a tremendous speaker, and I'm excited about his coming to our church.
[time=3538] I understand that he's taught at Dallas Theological Seminary for some 19 years, and he's an author.
[time=3544] He's written many books, understand that he has articles in Christianity today, Moody Monthly, and many of the national magazines,
[time=3551] so I'm really excited about having him come, and I'm looking forward to his ministry.
[time=3555] I am too, and I know that all of our people will be encouraged greatly.
[time=3559] We just hope that you'll continue to pray and to support the Bible hour in the days ahead.
