[time=566] Good morning. Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour.
[time=570] I'm Pastor Rick Hawks and I'm the Associate Pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=575] And with me this morning is Don Kruger, our Minister of Music.
[time=578] Don, I'm so thankful that you and I have a chance just to chat with our TV audience this morning
[time=584] to give them an update of the things that are going to be going on here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and on the Bible Hour.
[time=591] We certainly hope that you're praying with us as we seek God's will to identify a new pastor to lead all of the ministries here.
[time=599] The most important is your prayers and we covet earnestly that you'd be praying with us that God would lead just the right man to lead us in the next coming years.
[time=609] Today we have a special speaker on the Bible Hour.
[time=612] His name is Dr. Haddon Robinson and I'd like Don to tell you just a little bit about him.
[time=618] Well, Rick, I'm really excited about the prospect of hearing Dr. Robinson.
[time=622] I wrote the article in this week that spoke about Dr. Robinson and he seems like a very interesting person and I understand he's a tremendous Bible teacher.
[time=632] He is the President of Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary.
[time=636] He's taught at Dallas Theological Seminary for some 19 years taught homiletics and taught Bible and preaching.
[time=644] He received the outstanding preacher award from Bob Jones University and he will be very at home in front of our cameras since he is the one who produced a film
[time=656] for television called Film Festival and he hosted that program.
[time=660] So I'm really looking forward to hearing Dr. Haddon Robinson.
[time=664] Well, it sounds like we're in for quite a treat.
[time=666] I know he was the teaching professor of preaching when Pastor Jeremiah was at Dallas Theological Seminary.
[time=673] I had a chance to pick him up at the airport yesterday and he's a delightful man of God.
[time=679] And Don next week we have Dr. Paul Benware who is on the staff of Moody Bible Institute.
[time=685] Some of our viewers may remember that Dr. Benware was here four years ago in August and gave an excellent message about the Christian commitment to the obedient life.
[time=695] We're looking forward to hearing Dr. Robinson today and then Dr. Benware next week.
[time=702] During this time on the insert, Don and I would like to share with you some Bible literature
[time=708] that would be of help to your Christian life.
[time=710] And today Don wants to share with you a little bit about a tool called The Ready Reference Guide.
[time=715] Thank you, Rick. This is a tremendous little tool for Bible study.
[time=720] It has different topics that we could find in the Word of God.
[time=724] Like, for instance, comfort, humility, judgment seat of Christ, love, mark of the beast,
[time=732] marriage supper of the lamb, topics that maybe we would not be able to put our fingers on a scripture verse right away.
[time=739] But with this little handy tool, we could just look up the topic and find it.
[time=743] I think it's good for us personally to use in our Bible study, but it's also good for us to share with friends.
[time=749] For instance, if a friend comes and is bereaved or needs to have some comfort, we just look up a section on comfort or bereavement and loss.
[time=760] And here there are some scripture verses, five, six, seven scripture verses that tell us what God has to say about those different things in our lives.
[time=768] It comes with a adhesive on the back, it's easily placed within our Bibles, and it's ready and handy for us, and it's called The Ready Reference Guide.
[time=779] If you would like one of these, we would invite you to write to us here at The Bible Hour.
[time=785] That's back 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 for The Ready Reference Guide.
[time=794] Thank you, Don. I know we've given out hundreds of those little booklets.
[time=798] I've had one in my Bible for many years and found it to be a real helpful tool for studying God's Word
[time=804] and being able to identify just the right verses for the point of interest.
[time=808] We're so thankful for you watching The Bible Hour, for your faithfulness in prayer, and for your faithfulness in financial support.
[time=816] Each week at this time, Don and I'll be giving you an update as to the things we're looking forward to
[time=822] in sharing with you our prayer requests.
[time=824] We know you'll be faithful both in prayer and in financial support.
[time=828] Today, we want to thank Mr. Herschel Baker for sponsoring The Bible Hour on Channel 21,
[time=834] WPTA in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=837] He has sponsored The Bible Hour in memory of Mary Alice Baker.
[time=841] Thank you again for joining us today.
[time=844] We're looking forward to sharing this time with you each week.
[time=852] [MUSIC]
[time=864] God understands you so.
[time=870] He sees the falling tear.
[time=880] And whispers I am with you,
[time=890] so faltered nots or fear.
[time=898] God understands you longing.
[time=908] Your deepest grief he'll share.
[time=917] So let him bear your burden.
[time=926] He understands and cares.
[time=940] [MUSIC]
[time=946] God understands your weakness.
[time=954] He knows the temptor's power.
[time=959] But he will walk beside you.
[time=965] How ever dark beyond.
[time=972] God understands you longing.
[time=981] Your deepest grief he'll share.
[time=990] So let him bear your burden.
[time=1002] [MUSIC]
[time=1025] Thank you, Maria.
[time=1026] It's a good truth to be reminded of.
[time=1029] The Bible says, "Cast all your cares upon him, for he cares for you."
[time=1035] That's a good message as we think of our friends who are not well.
[time=1039] We want to be praying for Bob Mishler, the chairman of our board, who has an inner ear infection, and for Corey Kelly, a young boy whose arms have been burnt.
[time=1048] We're praying for them that the truth that God cares would sink deep into their heart.
[time=1053] Dennis Kirschner and Ron Hackett come the same for us, lead me, oh lead me.
[time=1060] [MUSIC]
[time=1070] Dark is the road that lies before me.
[time=1080] How can I find my way?
[time=1089] Tangle the path that beckons to me.
[time=1099] Lead me, oh lord, I pray.
[time=1108] Lead me, oh lead me.
[time=1118] Never will I go astray or roll.
[time=1127] Lead me, oh lead me.
[time=1137] Lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1146] Dangerous are lurking, foes are threatening.
[time=1155] Satan, his power has shown.
[time=1165] Stay by my side, protect and guide me.
[time=1174] I dare not walk alone.
[time=1184] Lead me, oh lead me.
[time=1193] Never will I go astray or roll.
[time=1203] Lead me, oh lead me.
[time=1212] Lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1222] Never will I go astray or roll.
[time=1231] Lead me till I reach my heavenly home.
[time=1254] Thank you Ron and Dennis.
[time=1256] This morning it's our pleasure to have Dr. Haddon Robinson to lead us in our morning worship service, preaching God's Word.
[time=1264] Dr. Robinson is the President of Conservative Baptist Seminary in Denver, Colorado and has been on the faculty of Dallas Theological Seminary for many years.
[time=1275] It's our delight to welcome him to preach God's Word to us on this morning.
[time=1287] When the Apostle Paul wrote to the church at Rome, he said that their faith was known throughout the ancient world.
[time=1295] What Paul said about that congregation and the capital can be said of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1302] The faith of this congregation and its influence is known throughout a large part of America.
[time=1308] And every time I have come to be in this pope, I am reminded of the influence for Jesus Christ that you have in our society.
[time=1317] This morning I would like to speak to you from Luke chapter 10, beginning at verse 25.
[time=1326] If I were to ask you what God requires of you in your relationship to him, I suspect that there are many of you who might answer from Deuteronomy 6-5, that your responsibility is to love God with all of your heart and soul and strength and mind.
[time=1345] And of course you would be absolutely right.
[time=1348] If I were to ask you what God requires of you in your relationship to your neighbor, I suspect that you would answer even more rapidly that your responsibility is to love your neighbor too.
[time=1361] And the New Testament would be in a hardy agreement.
[time=1364] For Paul says that love is the fulfilling of a law, that the fruit of the spirit is love.
[time=1371] And when he wrote to the congregation in Rome, he told them that they were to own no man anything except to love one another.
[time=1380] But if I were to ask you a third question, and that is do you love God, that might be a bit more difficult.
[time=1389] I suspect that you would think about it and say, well, yes, down inside I do love God.
[time=1396] And on the surface at least there would be little that I could do to prove you wrong.
[time=1401] For in a sense, your love for God is an intensely personal thing, something known to you and something known to him.
[time=1409] But if I were to ask you the fourth question, and that is do you love your neighbor, that might be the most difficult of all.
[time=1418] I suspect that you would think about it and say, well, that depends.
[time=1424] I mean, after all, who is my neighbor?
[time=1427] You mean the folks who live next door or how about some of the folks who live across the street?
[time=1432] Or how about some of the people who live on the other side of town?
[time=1436] And why stop there?
[time=1438] Why not take in all the people that live in the state?
[time=1441] And why draw the line at the state line?
[time=1444] Why not take in all the people that live in the United States?
[time=1448] No, you might say, I don't think I can answer your question because I'm not sure who my neighbor is.
[time=1456] It's interesting that essentially this same conversation comes to us out of the pages of the New Testament.
[time=1464] Here in Luke chapter 10 verse 25, a young lawyer comes to question Jesus Christ.
[time=1472] He's not much an earnest.
[time=1474] In fact, what he wants to do is to sharpen his intellect on the razor strap of argument
[time=1480] and to increase his reputation as a scholar at the expense of a dull Galilean peasant.
[time=1486] And so he has the whole conversation mapped out in his notebook at home.
[time=1491] He knows how he'll begin and then imagines how Jesus will answer and then how he'll respond.
[time=1497] And it's not long before in his mind at least, he has Jesus in a kind of intellectual checkmate.
[time=1505] And he begins his conversation in verse 25 with one of the greatest questions that mankind has ever faced.
[time=1513] Ten thousand philosophies lay strewn along its path.
[time=1517] He begins by saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[time=1524] I must say, I admire the restraint of Jesus.
[time=1528] He could have responded and said to this man, "That's a very stupid question.
[time=1532] You ask what you must do to inherit eternal life." And the very nature of an inheritance is that you do nothing to get it.
[time=1542] Someone dies and leaves it to you and you simply accept it.
[time=1547] But Jesus didn't do that.
[time=1549] Jesus responded by saying to him, "You're a lawyer.
[time=1554] You know the Old Testament law.
[time=1556] What do you think it teaches?" And I think this young scholar was deeply disappointed in Jesus' reply.
[time=1564] Here he had come hoping for theological dialogue.
[time=1569] And Jesus was treating him like Ned in the first reader.
[time=1573] Just about anybody who grew up in the midst of the people of God would know the answer to that question.
[time=1578] And so he blurted out the reply, "You shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart and soul and strength and mind and your neighbor as yourself." And Jesus said, "That's a good answer.
[time=1591] You keep doing that and you'll live." Suddenly this young man realized that he had strung his own trap.
[time=1601] He was like a student allowed to write out his own examination.
[time=1607] And then he had proceeded to flunk it.
[time=1610] Oh, he had no problem with that bit about God.
[time=1614] Just about anybody in the community knew that he was religious.
[time=1620] It was that part about his neighbor that got under his skin.
[time=1624] About that he was not quite so sure.
[time=1627] And so he did in his day what you and I have done a score of times and hours.
[time=1634] Face to face with a clear requirement of God.
[time=1639] He said, "Who is my neighbor?" We've done that.
[time=1646] How many times we come to the Bible and see clearly what the Bible wants us to do.
[time=1653] But instead of obeying, what we try to do is get a discussion group started.
[time=1659] Because if we can discuss it long enough in just the right way,
[time=1665] instead of bending our lives to the scriptures, we can bend the scriptures to fit our lives.
[time=1672] And that was the mood of his question because he sought to justify himself.
[time=1677] When he asked, "Who is my neighbor?" Then answering that question, Jesus does not give to this lawyer a long, involved definition of neighbor love.
[time=1689] Instead he tells him a story.
[time=1692] It's one of those stories that lies like a booby trap on the pages of the New Testament.
[time=1700] You pick it up and it seems almost like a child's toy.
[time=1705] And then it has a way of exploding and tearing you apart.
[time=1710] It's the story of the Good Samaritan.
[time=1716] So that the details of the story may be familiar to you.
[time=1720] Let me read it again as it comes to us from Luke chapter 10.
[time=1725] Beginning in verse 30, Jesus said, "A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho
[time=1732] when he fell into the hands of robbers.
[time=1735] They stripped him of his clothes and beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
[time=1740] A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
[time=1748] And so too a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
[time=1756] But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was, and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
[time=1763] And he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.
[time=1768] Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.
[time=1774] The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper.
[time=1779] "Look after him," he said.
[time=1781] "And when I return, I'll reimburse you for any extra expense you may have."
[time=1787] Now, which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?
[time=1793] And the expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him."
[time=1799] And Jesus told him, "Go and keep on doing likewise."
[time=1805] Now, in order to answer the question, "Who is my neighbor?" Jesus took this man out of his world, his world of theory, his world of theology.
[time=1817] And he took him into another world, into a world that's known to ambulance drivers, into police sargents,
[time=1824] and to people who work in the emergency room of hospitals.
[time=1828] And in that world, he found the answer to the question, "Who is my neighbor?"
[time=1835] But if we are to understand these corking good stories that Jesus told us,
[time=1842] then the viewpoint we have, as we read the story, is absolutely essential.
[time=1849] Helmutiliki, the noted German theologian, said that in understanding the parables of Jesus,
[time=1857] the viewpoint is basic.
[time=1859] And then in order to illustrate what he meant, he told of a time when his son was just a babe in arms.
[time=1869] He held the boy up in front of a mirror.
[time=1874] The child moved, and the reflection moved.
[time=1877] The child waved, and the reflection waved, and then suddenly the child's face lit up.
[time=1883] But he realized, "They're in the mirror." That's me.
[time=1890] Every now and then, that happens when you read the Bible.
[time=1894] You pick it up, and it looks like a black print on a white page.
[time=1901] But then as you read it, you discover that the print has a way of fading, and sometimes there on the page of the scriptures, you find the reflection of yourself.
[time=1914] In reading the stories of Jesus, the viewpoint is everything.
[time=1920] So the question is, "Who is my neighbor?" And if we're going to get the right point of view, then the question is, "Who's viewpoint should we take?" Well, one point of view that we might take in answering the question, "Who is my neighbor?" is the viewpoint of that man who was beaten up by muggers, left to die by the side of the road.
[time=1949] I can imagine that we might come up to that man and say, "Pardon me, sir.
[time=1956] We're taking a kind of religious survey." And I wonder, from your position down there by the side of the road, just who is your neighbor?
[time=1967] If a man had strength enough to reply, I suspect that his answer would have been as wide as the world, just about anybody coming down the Jarrick Road.
[time=1979] Just about anybody willing to stop would qualify completely.
[time=1986] That's the way it is, isn't it?
[time=1988] When we're driving down the highway, and our car comes shugging to a stop, and we do not have the tools or the talent to repair it, anybody willing to stop, anybody willing to lend a hand, qualifies completely as a neighbor.
[time=2010] It's when the other man's car has broken down and we're doing quite well that we can define neighbor with all of the preciseness of a sheist, a lawyer.
[time=2022] Years ago, when my son Tory was just a boy in arms,
[time=2029] he's a little older than that.
[time=2031] We were coming home from Sunday school, and he told me that they had had the story of the good Samaritan.
[time=2041] I asked him to tell me about it, and he gave me a kind of blow-by-blow description of what had taken place.
[time=2049] And then when he was all through, I said to him, "What was the spiritual lesson of the story?" I mean, why did they tell it to you?
[time=2059] It was obvious that I had caught him off base, because he said, "Well, that story teaches that whenever I'm in trouble, you've got to help me." Well, that's part of the lesson.
[time=2075] At least that's the viewpoint of the man by the side of the road, but it's not the total lesson.
[time=2084] For occupying center stage in this parable are a priest and a Levite.
[time=2092] If this poor man by the side of the road were making a list of candidates for neighbor, then the priest and the Levite would have been at the top of the list, because tradition tells us that before these men left their homes in the morning,
[time=2113] they recited those two great verses from the Old Testament.
[time=2118] You shall love the Lord, your God, with all of your heart, and soul, and strength, and mind, and your neighbor, as yourself.
[time=2127] In fact, before they went to bed again in the evening, they recited those verses again.
[time=2134] Who then would better qualify as a neighbor than men who knew those great affirmations of the Word of God?
[time=2145] And yet Jesus tells us that when the priest came down that road,
[time=2151] he passed the man by on the other side.
[time=2155] It's hard to understand that.
[time=2159] It's hard to identify with a man who would pass by
[time=2165] someone who had been beaten up by muggers and left to die.
[time=2171] It certainly doesn't sound like us.
[time=2174] It certainly doesn't sound like our kind of folk, not the kind of people that live in our town who are part of our church.
[time=2184] In fact, that man sounds a lot like the folks who live back in Queens, New York, who looked out of their window one night and saw a young woman being beaten to death, and didn't even bother to reach over and pick up a phone to call the police.
[time=2203] Certainly not us, not our kind of folk.
[time=2208] But if you're tempted to think that, that's because you're still outside the story looking in.
[time=2215] Because I'm sure that that priest had some good sound reasons
[time=2221] or at least reasons that sounded good for doing what he did.
[time=2227] And since he was a religious type, I suspect that his reasons were religious.
[time=2234] Back in the Old Testament in the book of Leviticus, the Scripture said that if a priest touched a dead body,
[time=2244] he would become ceremonially defiled.
[time=2247] And so I can imagine the priest thinking, "You know, I'd like to stop." But it would be just my luck to pick this man up, and he would die in my arms.
[time=2258] And then I'd have to go through all of the rights of cleansing, and there would be those messy explanations, and it could really hurt my influence.
[time=2267] Now, I don't know that he thought that way, but I do know that whether he thought that way or not, we sometimes do.
[time=2277] There has been, in the Church of Jesus Christ, a doctrine which has sometimes been called the doctrine of separation.
[time=2287] The logic of that doctrine goes something like this.
[time=2291] As Christians, we want to live holy lives,
[time=2297] and we want to be separate from sin.
[time=2300] And there are all kinds of things that we feel we ought not do.
[time=2305] And then the next stage is to know that there are people out there in our society who do those things, who have our lifestyle, we do not approve of, who use languages that we do not like, who have habits that we do not approve.
[time=2324] And so not only do we separate from sinful activities, we often separate from sinful people.
[time=2331] And often in the name of holiness, in preserving our testimony, whatever that is,
[time=2337] we separate from the very people on our Jericho Road who are in need of our help.
[time=2345] The second man down the road was a Levite.
[time=2348] If the priest was like the pastor at the church,
[time=2354] then the Levite was like the assistant pastor.
[time=2357] He ministered, he was in charge of the scrolls.
[time=2361] And Jesus says that this man also passed by the wounded traveler on the other side.
[time=2369] Again, you can't help wondering what went through his mind.
[time=2374] Perhaps he thought, well, like pastor, like assistant pastor.
[time=2380] If the pastor can't stop, I'm busier than he is.
[time=2383] I can't stop either.
[time=2386] But perhaps he thought, you know, I'm on my way to Jerusalem.
[time=2395] And I'm going to give a lecture on neighbor love.
[time=2399] And there are a couple of hundred people waiting to hear what I had to say.
[time=2403] And so what I'll do is jot this man down on a three by five card,
[time=2409] and I'll use him as an illustration.
[time=2412] And I'll challenge the young people to start a Jericho Road Mission Society.
[time=2417] Get this thing organized and come back here and help people like this.
[time=2422] Now again, I do not know that he thought that way.
[time=2426] But I do know that whether he thought that way or not, we sometimes do.
[time=2433] Well, there is a kind of arithmetic that has been spawned in the counting rooms of hell.
[time=2441] And that's the kind of arithmetic that becomes so interested in reaching the masses.
[time=2448] It never gets around to reaching the man.
[time=2452] So concerned with going across continents that it never really makes its way across the street.
[time=2459] So concerned about reaching a world that it never reaches the individual.
[time=2467] But the third man down that road that day was a Samaritan.
[time=2475] If the priest and the Levite were at the top of the list of candidates for neighbor,
[time=2482] then the Samaritan was at the bottom of the list.
[time=2485] Because the Jews and the Samaritans hated each other.
[time=2490] In fact, whenever a Jew talked about a Samaritan, he simply called them a dog and everybody knew exactly who was meant.
[time=2500] And yet Jesus tells us that when this Samaritan saw the man, he was moved with pity.
[time=2508] He got down on his knees by the side of that dirt road and took oil and wine and cleansed the wounds and then bandaged them.
[time=2516] He took the man and put him on his donkey and took him to a hotel and sat up with him through the night.
[time=2523] And when the next day came, he paid the room rent that became surety for the rest.
[time=2530] And Jesus ends by asking, "Now, which of these three men proved to be a neighbor?
[time=2539] The two who knew the Bible verses or the one who gave help?"
[time=2546] And this lawyer, not willing to take the name Samaritan on his lips, said the one who showed mercy.
[time=2554] And Jesus responded by saying, "Go and keep on doing likewise."
[time=2561] And from this story of the good Samaritan, Jesus gives us the answer to the question, "Who is my neighbor?"
[time=2568] And the answer is as simple as it is sublime.
[time=2572] For Jesus is saying that your neighbor is anyone who's need you see, who's need.
[time=2580] You're in a position to me.
[time=2583] It's as simple and as sublime as that.
[time=2588] Your neighbor is anyone who's need you see, who's need.
[time=2594] You're in a position to me.
[time=2597] There are certain things that we often put into the definition of neighbor that Jesus obviously excludes.
[time=2605] For example, your neighbor may be somebody you do not know.
[time=2609] There is no evidence that the Jew or the Samaritan had ever met each other before.
[time=2616] And one mark of the love of Jesus Christ in his church has been that the scores of people have gone to other countries to work with people.
[time=2627] They did not know whose language they could not speak merely because they recognized that there were needs that they could meet.
[time=2637] Your neighbor may be unfriendly.
[time=2640] The Jews and the Samaritans were bitter enemies.
[time=2644] And you may find that your neighbor is somebody who slams the door in your face, or somebody who talks about you behind your back.
[time=2653] Your neighbor may be unlovely.
[time=2656] There is nothing particularly attractive about a man lying in a pool of blood by the side of a dirt road.
[time=2665] And your neighbor may have a lifestyle you do not approve of, a closed style you do not like.
[time=2672] May say things and do things that you find offensive.
[time=2678] Your neighbor may be unrewarding.
[time=2681] There is no evidence that this Jew ever paid the Samaritan back for what he did.
[time=2690] There is a kind of love that the church has had for people which is concerned about people not because of what we can do for them, but because of what they can do for us.
[time=2700] They can help the attendants.
[time=2703] They can help the budget.
[time=2705] They can make us look good.
[time=2708] But Jesus is saying that this man took pity on this wounded stranger even though he did not know him, even though he was unlovely.
[time=2718] Even though he was unfriendly, even though he was unrewarding.
[time=2722] Because your neighbor is anyone whose need you see, whose need you are in a position to meet.
[time=2731] In fact, Jesus also by implication tells us what it takes to be a neighbor.
[time=2740] One thing it takes is that we often have to give time.
[time=2745] This Samaritan going down this Jericho road was not on a joy ride.
[time=2753] The Jericho road was one of the most dangerous highways in antiquity.
[time=2759] He had a destination to go to, but he stopped and got involved.
[time=2766] My wife and I have enjoyed twenty-five wonderfully happy years of marriage.
[time=2772] Twenty-five out of thirty isn't bad.
[time=2775] But along the way we've had some, well some conflict.
[time=2780] We've had some difficulty getting our act together.
[time=2783] One kind of problem we have faced, and you men will understand exactly what I mean.
[time=2789] It comes when we go on a trip. It seems to me that when you take a trip, the object of the trip is to get there.
[time=2797] Six hundred miles a day is a perfectly normal number of miles to cover.
[time=2805] My wife has never really understood that.
[time=2809] She likes to stop and read historical markers.
[time=2812] I'm willing to stop, gas station and place to get something to eat.
[time=2818] But somehow or other I want to get where I'm going.
[time=2824] And that was true of this Samaritan.
[time=2827] And yet he stopped and he got involved.
[time=2830] Quite frankly the hardest thing that I sometimes have to give to people is time.
[time=2839] Like many of you, I live a rather hectic, hurried, somewhat Harris life.
[time=2843] It's a lot easier to throw a check in the plate and have somebody else do it.
[time=2848] But this man got involved, he gave his time.
[time=2851] He also gave his money.
[time=2854] He took out two silver coins and paid the rent.
[time=2857] One coin was equal to one day's wage for a manual laborer.
[time=2862] He gave two and what is more, he promised to pay anything else that was necessary.
[time=2867] He gave his money, he gave his time to someone he did not know, to someone that was unfriendly,
[time=2873] to someone that was unlovely, to someone that was unrewarding.
[time=2877] Because your neighbor is anyone who's need you see, who's need.
[time=2883] You're in a position to me.
[time=2887] But there's a hook in that, isn't there?
[time=2889] When you say that your neighbor is anyone who's need you see, who's need you're able to meet.
[time=2897] But it's in that little phrase, your neighbor is anyone who's need you see.
[time=2902] Because it's evident as you read this story that all three of these men saw exactly the same thing.
[time=2910] In fact Jesus underlines that.
[time=2913] He says for example, in verse 31, a priest happened to be going down the same road.
[time=2920] And when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
[time=2924] And so to a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
[time=2930] But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was.
[time=2933] And when he saw him, he took pity on him.
[time=2938] All three of these men saw the same thing.
[time=2942] They saw a stranger lying by the side of the road, almost dead.
[time=2946] But then again they didn't see the same thing.
[time=2950] One man may have seen a ceremonial defilement.
[time=2954] The other may have seen a sermon illustration.
[time=2958] Only the Samaritan saw his neighbor.
[time=2963] Because buried beneath this story is another truth.
[time=2967] And that is that what you are determines what you see.
[time=2974] That's a great truth in life, isn't it?
[time=2977] You and I go to an art museum and you understand and appreciate art.
[time=2985] I do not.
[time=2986] And so we look at a large picture and you say to me, Robinson, you see that picture?
[time=2992] That's art.
[time=2994] And I look at the picture and say, yeah, that's art.
[time=2999] Same picture.
[time=3001] Just different people.
[time=3004] What we are determines what we see.
[time=3010] When I was growing up, I became a Christian in my teens and some folks waylaid me into memorizing Bible verses.
[time=3020] And I memorize some of those nasty little verses over in 1 John.
[time=3026] You know the kind of verse that says, if you say you love God and do not love your brother, you are a liar.
[time=3037] For if you do not love your brother whom you have seen, how can you love God whom you have not seen?
[time=3047] I memorize the verses, but quite frankly, I thought they were pious nonsense.
[time=3053] Because I could see no relationship at all between loving God and loving my brother.
[time=3058] It wasn't very hard to love God.
[time=3061] After all, he was always kind, always gracious, always working my side of the street.
[time=3068] But my brother, my neighbor, that was something else.
[time=3073] We had personality conflicts.
[time=3076] We talked about me behind my back.
[time=3079] It was always getting in my way.
[time=3082] And I couldn't see any relationship between loving Him and loving God.
[time=3088] But as time passed, I came to realize that John was on to something.
[time=3095] And that is what John is getting at, is that Christian love is not primarily objective.
[time=3105] That is Christian love does not reside in the person out there being love.
[time=3114] It resides in the person doing the loving.
[time=3118] I came to realize that my basic premise was wrong when I thought that it was easy to love God.
[time=3125] What I discovered was that by nature the heart is a rebel and it turns against God.
[time=3132] And that the only way I am able to love God is because the love of God Himself is shed abroad in my heart
[time=3140] through the Holy Spirit and the same love that enables me to love God in heaven and enables me to love my brother and my neighbor on earth.
[time=3149] And that is why it becomes nonsense to talk about loving God in heaven and not loving your brother, your neighbor, whose need you save.
[time=3159] You see this lawyer thought that he had God in his back pocket.
[time=3165] He thought that his question was only with his neighbor.
[time=3172] What Jesus is saying is if you're trying to define your neighbor out of your life, that says two things.
[time=3178] It says first of all, your love for your neighbor is insincere, but it says something deeper than that.
[time=3184] And that is it says that your love for God is insufficient.
[time=3189] The same love that enables you to love God in heaven, enables you to love your neighbor on earth as well.
[time=3198] And what you are, what God makes of you determines what you see.
[time=3204] What you see determines what you do.
[time=3210] Remember when we were growing up, we memorized that the child's poem, how does it go?
[time=3217] Pussycat, Pussycat, where have you been?
[time=3220] I've been to London to see the Queen.
[time=3224] Pussycat, Pussycat, what saw you there?
[time=3227] I saw a wee mouse sitting under her chair of all of the cities of the world that I have ever visited.
[time=3236] I think that London is probably the greatest.
[time=3239] There is the tower of London with the blood of history soaking its bricks.
[time=3245] There's the Westminster Abbey cradling its historic dead.
[time=3249] There's the Buckingham Palace and the residents of the Queen and the changing of the guard.
[time=3255] Here's a cat who's been there.
[time=3258] Now she's back home and she's showing her slides.
[time=3263] Everybody gathers around and says, "Pussycat, did you get to the palace? Oh, yes, I was in the palace."
[time=3269] Well, Pussycat, did you get inside? Oh, yes, I got right inside. I was in the throne room of the Queen.
[time=3275] Well, Pussycat was the Queen there. Oh, yes, the Queen was there.
[time=3279] Well, Pussycat, what did she look like? I mean, how tall is she? How does she wear her hair?
[time=3286] And the cat says, "I didn't notice." You didn't notice.
[time=3292] Well, Pussycat, what did you see in the throne room of the Queen in the presence of her majesty?
[time=3301] And the cat says, "Well, underneath her chair was one of the nicest little mites you'd ever want to see."
[time=3311] Why? Because she had a Pussycat heart.
[time=3318] And when you've got the heart of a Pussycat, mice are infinitely more important than queens.
[time=3328] You see, what you are determines what you see and what you see determines what you do.
[time=3336] And you only really see your neighbor's need when God does a work in your life.
[time=3345] That brings us back to our beginning, doesn't it?
[time=3350] And that is, do you love God? What's good?
[time=3359] I appreciate that testimony. I'm glad to know that you do.
[time=3364] Then that leads us to a second question. Do you love your neighbor?
[time=3371] Because it becomes a kind of pious nonsense to talk about loving God whom we have not seen,
[time=3383] and not loving our brother or our neighbor whom we do see.
[time=3390] For your neighbor is anyone who's need you see, who's need you are able to meet.
[time=3400] Will you bow with me in prayer?
[time=3405] Our father, we thank you that you want to make us loving people.
[time=3413] And we pray that your work might be done in our lives so that we shall see people in all of their needs.
[time=3424] And where we are able to, we shall meet those needs, for Jesus' sake.
[time=3433] And while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
