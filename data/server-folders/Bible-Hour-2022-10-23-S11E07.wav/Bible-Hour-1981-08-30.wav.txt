[time=316] That is inspiring to hear them sing of the God of everlasting glory.
[time=322] We call this service a worship service, and it's good for our hearts to sing praises to our God.
[time=328] We're delighted to have the choir sing those great anthems of praise.

[time=573] Hello, thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=577] We're looking forward to the service today with Dr. Paul Benware.
[time=581] Over recent weeks, Pastor Jeremiah has shared with you our need financially on the Bible Hour.
[time=587] And we want to thank each and every one of you for responding to that need.
[time=591] We're rejoicing in what God has done.
[time=594] Through your gifts and support, almost all of our past deficit has been erased.
[time=599] We have $20,000 yet to take care of, but we're trusting God for that and want to take this opportunity this morning to thank you for your help.
[time=609] With me right now is Don Kruger, our Minister of Music.
[time=613] Don is going to share a little bit with you about our speaker today, Dr. Paul Benware.
[time=618] Thank you, Pastor Rick. I'm really excited about our speaker.
[time=621] I've not heard of myself, but I've heard much about him.
[time=624] Dr. Paul Benware is the Professor of Moody Bible Institute.
[time=628] He's an author and an excellent speaker, and we're looking forward to having him speak in our service this morning.
[time=633] Next week, we have Pastor Rick.
[time=636] Many of you have not been able to have the privilege of hearing him.
[time=640] He has spoken on occasion on the television program, but usually substituted for Pastor Jeremiah on occasion,
[time=647] and next week he starts a series for the month of September.
[time=651] I'm looking forward to that, too. Rick, tell us a little bit about what that series is going to have.
[time=656] Don, in recent days, I've been studying through the book of Philippians diligently.
[time=661] It's a book of tremendous joy and enthusiasm, and it's filled my heart, and I'm looking forward to starting next week sharing with you a series on triumphant living.
[time=672] The Apostle Paul wrote from the prison of Rome how to be joyful in the worst of circumstances.
[time=678] I'm looking forward to sharing that message with all of our friends and family on the Bible hour.
[time=684] Each week we want to share something of help to you in your Christian life, and again today we have the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=691] Don, would you tell our friends a little bit about this?
[time=694] Sure, Pastor Rick. This is a very, very handy tool for Bible study.
[time=700] It's something that you can use for counseling.
[time=703] It has an adhesive back on it. It's something that you could put into your Bible, and then if a friend comes to you and has a problem with discouragement or fear or whatever, you look up that topic and title, and then there are some scripture verses for those particular topics.
[time=720] It's very, very handy. It's a Ready Reference Tool. It's a Bible study guide.
[time=725] Oh, great. Thank you, Don. If you would like this Bible study tool, write to us today.
[time=731] Write the Bible hour, Box 1500, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46, 815.
[time=740] Also this morning we have a special guest with us today.
[time=743] Pastor George Lantman is our minister in charge of hospital visitations and senior citizens ministry. George, welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=752] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=754] Thank you, Pastor Rick. I appreciate that.
[time=757] I would like to share something with the audience now if I could.
[time=761] Hawaii 81 is an opportunity for all adults to have pleasant Hawaiian holidays.
[time=768] 14 days of trip to Hawaii, four islands, five meals.
[time=775] Many side trips are all included for the total cost of $13.99.
[time=781] This will not be available again. I'm certain at this cost.
[time=784] So if you want to go along with us, you just make it known to us by calling us.
[time=790] During the hours of work on Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to five o'clock,
[time=797] call the church office, ask for me, Pastor Lantman, or for Hawaii 81.
[time=803] And we will send you a color brochure which will give you information of each day.
[time=808] And I'm sure that you would be glad to go along with us and enjoy this trip, which is going to be a wonderful time in Hawaii.
[time=817] This total cost again is $13.99. The number to call is area code 219-749-8524.
[time=827] If you're interested, call early because there's limited amount of space available.
[time=831] Thank you, Pastor Rick. I think this would have been a enjoyable trip for many, many people.
[time=835] Thank you for sharing it with us, George.
[time=838] George began a ministry to senior citizens here just about three years ago with a small handful of people.
[time=844] And through his love and effort, there's nearly 200 people that gather each week.
[time=848] Hawaii 81 is their second trip, and I know you would enjoy a chance to take a tour
[time=854] of the Hawaiian Islands with a group of Christians under the leadership of George and Mary Lantman.
[time=860] Thank you again for joining us today on The Bible Hour.
[time=863] We'd love to hear from you. Won't you write to us today?
[time=867] Write to The Bible Hour, Box 1500, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46-815.
[time=875] Thank you, George and Don, for joining us today.
[time=878] We're going to return to our service with Dr. Ben Ware.
[time=890] This is the day that the Lord hath made. Rejoice and be glad there is.
[time=897] Just don't bend your heart to hear his voice and fear.
[time=902] His touch and then return. Pray the Lord, Lord.
[time=905] This is the day that the Lord hath made. Rejoice and be glad there is.
[time=912] Lift up your voice and sing to Christ the living King.
[time=916] Rejoice and be glad.
[time=920] This is the day that the Lord hath made. Rejoice and be glad there is.
[time=927] Just don't bend your heart to hear his voice and fear.
[time=932] This touch and then return.
[time=938] Pray the Lord, Lord. This is the day that the Lord hath made. Rejoice and be glad there is.
[time=946] Lift up your voice and sing to Christ the living King. Rejoice and be glad.
[time=964] Thank you, ladies. That is tremendous to hear the word of God put to music.
[time=969] Strictly feminine singing. Rejoice.
[time=972] This is the day that the Lord has made. Psalm 118, 24.
[time=977] After strictly feminine, it's appropriate that we have the men-singer sing.
[time=981] And so the men-singers are coming out that they might sing for us. His name is love.
[time=994] There was a day unknown before in history when God came down to dwell as man.
[time=1022] As a helpless baby came, the Lord of heaven.
[time=1030] O child, what love he must have had for you and for me.
[time=1038] Love came down, that holy night. Love came down to save us all.
[time=1053] And one day loved him on a cross to take my place. His name is love.
[time=1064] Love. Love. His name is Jesus.
[time=1076] That was a day when God revealed Himself to man through Jesus Christ His only Son.
[time=1091] What a perfect life he lived. What wisdom taught us.
[time=1100] But most of all, what love he had for you and for me.
[time=1108] Love came down, that holy night. Love came down to save us all.
[time=1123] And one day loved him on a cross to take my place. His name is love.
[time=1139] His name is Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[time=1169] Thank you, men, for the reminder that Jesus Christ is the God of love, that He loves every one of us.
[time=1180] We have leading us in our Bible study today as we study God's word, Dr. Paul Benware.
[time=1186] Dr. Benware is a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary and he is a past member of the faculty at Los Angeles Bible College.
[time=1196] He's presently on the faculty and staff of Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1201] We're so thankful to have with us this morning Dr. Paul Benware.
[time=1215] Thank you. It's good to be with you folks again. I was here several years ago and I remember quite well.
[time=1224] I spoke on the area of prophecy that day.
[time=1228] As I was reminding the earlier congregation, as I was speaking away and it talked about the rapture, we got some feedback through the sound system.
[time=1237] There was this loud pop and three or four of the saints who had been slumbering right down in here.
[time=1245] Evidently felt the rapture was taking place and you could just see them elevate up a bit, but I certainly had their attention the rest of the hour.
[time=1253] It's good to be here and I trust that our few moments around the Word of God will prove to be a profitable ones to us this morning.
[time=1261] Let's pray and ask the Lord to speak to us from His Word.
[time=1266] Father, thank you for the opportunity now to look at your Word and we pray that you would use it in our lives today.
[time=1273] We ask in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1277] It's interesting, the things or the people that people will put their faith or their confidence in.
[time=1287] Individuals will trust tea leaves or rabbits' foots or a number of things like that.
[time=1294] They'll put their confidence in those things and sometimes they'll put their confidence in people who turn out to be very untrustworthy.
[time=1303] I'm sure all of us still have somewhat fresh in our memories, the Jones Town incident.
[time=1309] Many are still asking the question of how it is that a group of people, many college trained and educated people would put their faith in an individual like that.
[time=1322] But people will do that, won't they?
[time=1324] Put their confidence, put their faith in people or things that are totally untrustworthy.
[time=1331] I suppose that all of us have seen pictures or slides of that aborigine or that tribesman in some way off culture bowing down before a God of wood or a God of stone.
[time=1348] And we think to ourselves, there's a man who's putting his faith in something that can't help him, that's totally untrustworthy.
[time=1359] Is it possible for us to do something like that?
[time=1363] Not to perhaps bow down before an idol of stone or of wood, but is it possible for religious people?
[time=1372] For people perhaps who have a claim to a relationship with Jesus Christ, is it possible for them to live lives that are basically lives of unbelief?
[time=1384] To have their faith planted and placed in something or in someone that's not trustworthy?
[time=1392] And if so, what are the consequences of that type of lifestyle for a believer?
[time=1399] You know, there are a lot of battles that have taken place in Palestine over the years.
[time=1404] And in the scriptures, God records one of those battles for us in the Old Testament book of 1 Samuel.
[time=1412] And I think one of the reasons why he records that for us is because in that text of scripture,
[time=1419] we find a spiritual principle that it is just as valid today as it was back then.
[time=1426] A principle that affects the way you and I live right now.
[time=1431] So if you have your Bibles, why don't you turn with me to 1 Samuel chapter 4?
[time=1438] And we're going to be exploring the first 11 verses this morning, 1 Samuel chapter 4.
[time=1447] Now, since you haven't had a chance yet to investigate this text, let me paint a little bit of the backdrop for you.
[time=1458] These are the days of the judges.
[time=1461] Now, even though we are in the book of 1 Samuel and in chapter 4, we are actually in the tail end of the era of the judges.
[time=1469] Maybe you remember what that's like.
[time=1472] Those were years of spiritual ups and downs for the nation of Israel, mainly downs.
[time=1480] And so much of the life of Israel was lived in the darkness of moral and spiritual darkness.
[time=1490] And it's at the end of that period that God is going to raise up a man by the name of Samuel.
[time=1497] And of course, through Samuel, humanly speaking, he will turn the nation around.
[time=1502] Today we're coming to a passage of scripture where we're getting right up to the end of this era.
[time=1508] And we're looking at a battle, a battle that took place between the Israelites and their perpetual enemies, the Philistines.
[time=1517] Now, when we look at this battle, we are looking at a series of battles that have taken place, and this is one of them.
[time=1527] Something happens here, though.
[time=1529] Something happens in the national life of Israel that will be very instructive to us, I believe.
[time=1535] Let's look at the first three verses together.
[time=1540] Now, Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped in Afek.
[time=1550] And the Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel.
[time=1555] When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about 4,000 men on the battlefield.
[time=1565] When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines?"
[time=1577] Now, if you can activate your imaginations just a little bit.
[time=1581] Here we are in the central plains of Palestine.
[time=1586] On one side of the battlefield, there is the encampment of Israel, on the other side of the Philistines.
[time=1592] They have, as they did in those days, come together and locked in hand-to-hand combat.
[time=1598] When the dust settles and the body count is taken, we discover that 4,000 of Israel's finest young men have died.
[time=1608] It is obvious that the Philistines have won.
[time=1612] As the Israelites come back to their camp to retrench, and to talk about this, we find that there are questions written all over their faces.
[time=1622] I imagine that as they meant together there in a headquarters tent that they probably kicked this thing around,
[time=1630] and the best military minds got together and wondered how in the world can we defeat the Philistines?
[time=1637] For you see, in one sense, this was round one, and there was at least another round to come.
[time=1643] We don't know what went on there as far as discussion was concerned.
[time=1648] They probably threw out all kinds of possibilities until somebody came up with an idea.
[time=1654] And that idea is recorded for us in verse 3, where we read, "Let us take to ourselves from Shiloh, the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
[time=1665] that it may come among us and deliver us from the power of our enemies.
[time=1677] Now this is actually the hinge on which this whole story swings.
[time=1684] You see what they're saying?
[time=1686] They are saying we've been defeated in battle.
[time=1690] Now how are we going to win? Aha, we've got it. We'll get the ark of God up here.
[time=1696] Now what was the ark? Remember what that was? It was a box. A wooden box.
[time=1702] Two and a half feet wide, two and a half feet high, three and a half feet long.
[time=1709] It was overlaid with gold. It had a lid on it with some angelic figures.
[time=1716] And that was called the Mercy Sea. It was placed into the tabernacle and what was called the Holy of Holies.
[time=1724] Why in the world would they want the ark of God there?
[time=1728] Well, perhaps you remember something of the significance of this box.
[time=1733] Remember it was the ark of God that had been carried on the priest's shoulders when they crossed the Jordan River.
[time=1741] God had parted the waters and they had gone over on dry ground.
[time=1745] And then a short time later, as Joshua and the Israelites went around Jericho those 13 times,
[time=1752] it was the ark of God that had led them around the city of Jericho before the walls fell.
[time=1760] And they assumed that if they could bring the ark of God into the camp, then victory would undoubtedly be theirs.
[time=1768] I want you to notice something, though, because I think this is a key to understanding this story.
[time=1774] But perhaps even more important, it's the key in digging out the spiritual principle and issue that's important for our lives today.
[time=1784] Again, notice verse 3, the last part.
[time=1788] They say, "Let us go to Shiloh. Let's get the ark of the covenant of the Lord that it may come among us
[time=1797] that it may deliver us from our enemies."
[time=1803] You see, their confidence was not placed in the Lord.
[time=1808] Their confidence was placed in this box, and they felt that by bringing the ark here, they could be delivered and helped.
[time=1820] Now, I suppose that if we had gone into the camp of the Israelites, and we had asked those soldiers,
[time=1827] say, "Who's your God, anyhow?" They undoubtedly would have said, "Well, we serve the Lord Jehovah. We don't serve Baal or any one of the Canaanite gods.
[time=1835] We serve the Lord." Do you think it's a good idea to bring the ark up here?
[time=1840] Oh, yeah.
[time=1841] Yeah, great idea.
[time=1843] Joshua had it here, and what with the ark here we can't lose.
[time=1847] But you see, there's a tremendous difference. It's subtle in a way, but nevertheless tremendous.
[time=1851] The difference between putting your confidence in the Lord and putting your confidence in the ark.
[time=1858] It's a subtle difference, but it's the difference between day and night, and as we'll be seeing in a little bit, it's the difference between life and death for the Israelites.
[time=1869] The issue here is faith, trust. The issue of where their confidence is placed, when they are facing the decisions and tough things of life.
[time=1881] I want to stop here for just a moment and remind ourselves, because we're not just interested in ancient history this morning, at least I'm not.
[time=1889] I don't think you've gathered here so that I could tell you a story about a battle that occurred several thousand years ago.
[time=1896] But there's a principle here. There's something for us to grasp onto.
[time=1900] You see, we are not that much different from the Israelites and the situation that they faced.
[time=1906] Now you say, I don't get it. We drove all the Philistines out of our neighborhood years ago.
[time=1914] We haven't fought a Philistine in a long time.
[time=1918] The situation is perhaps not identical, but the issue is, the issue is that when you are confronted with decisions and problems in life, and we all are, where do you go for your answers?
[time=1933] Where is your confidence? Is it in your friends, in your church? Is it in the financial situation, your job?
[time=1944] There's all kinds of places that we can put our confidence, including our confidence in the Lord.
[time=1950] Now, let me ask you this.
[time=1954] Would you say, if you know Jesus Christ as your Savior, would you say that you are living a life of faith?
[time=1964] On a daily basis, would you say that your confidence is in the Lord?
[time=1970] That's a hard question, isn't it? I find that hard to answer.
[time=1975] Am I a person characterized by faith? Do I live by faith, and if I do or don't, what difference does it make?
[time=1984] You and I have discovered, and I think I'm right, that the best way that I know of determining whether or not my life is characterized by a real trust in the Lord,
[time=1998] is whether or not I am praying, whether or not my life is characterized by genuine prayer, that my prayer times are real things.
[time=2011] I am actively coming before the Lord and laying before Him, the problems that I'm facing, the decisions that I must make.
[time=2019] Let me ask you a question. Now, I'm really not trying to put anybody here on a guilt trip. We go on those easily enough by ourselves without being helped along.
[time=2029] But let me ask you something. Did you pray this morning before you came here?
[time=2036] Well, you said, you've never seen Sundays around our house. Who can pray in that chaos? Okay, I can buy that.
[time=2046] What about yesterday, Saturday? I said, well, you know, Saturday is the only time I can sleep in.
[time=2053] And once I've slept a little longer, I jump out of bed and the day engulfs me. Just didn't have time yesterday.
[time=2060] I can buy that too. Of course, I'm not the one you have to answer to, but I can buy that. What about Friday? Friday was a tough day, end of the week.
[time=2071] Thursday, Wednesday, and on we go. So often we would have to candidly say, we believe in prayer. We believe prayer is important, but we don't pray.
[time=2085] And prayer really doesn't characterize our lives as believers. And I am convinced that prayerlessness is the believer's declaration of independence from God.
[time=2098] Now, we don't surface it, and we don't say that, but really isn't that what we're doing when we do not really pray as believers.
[time=2107] And prayer is really not a heart and parcel of our lives. We are in essence saying, thanks Lord, but I really can handle it myself.
[time=2120] And you see, what we have done, not purposely perhaps, but what we have done is shifted our confidence, our trust, our faith away from the Lord and onto something else.
[time=2132] It may be ourselves. It may be the community of believers that we're in. It may be our ability to work. It could be a whole host of things, but the point is that we have redirected our faith, even though we would know better.
[time=2148] And if we were interviewed, and somebody asked us, who is your God? We would be glad to tell them. And do you trust him? Yes, I trust him.
[time=2158] And yet, perhaps on a daily basis, that really isn't so true. Well, let's get back to the text, because it's very interesting what happens here in the national life of Israel.
[time=2169] See what's happened? They've been faced with a crisis situation. They've lost 4,000 soldiers. And by the way, remember as you page back through the Old Testament Scriptures, so often you will find that God led Israel into battle.
[time=2183] And they fought these mighty citadels and huge armies and sometimes the text records that they didn't lose a single man. That's incredible.
[time=2195] So if God had been with them, we would assume that there wouldn't have been 4,000 dying. But I want you to notice a phenomenon that takes place here in the text.
[time=2206] Look with me at verse 4 and 5. So the people sent to Shiloh. Now Shiloh was located about 20 miles away. Shiloh was the place where the tabernacle was located.
[time=2223] Joshua, 300 years before, had set up the tabernacle there with all of its holy furniture, including the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=2233] It had been there for three centuries. Never been moved. But now they sent to Shiloh. They're in a crisis situation. Get the Ark. And so they did.
[time=2244] It was carried back to the battlefield at Aephek on the shoulders of two of the priests, called Haphne and Phineas.
[time=2254] Two, by the way, very immoral priests talked about in chapter 3. They're part of the problem. Certainly not part of the solution.
[time=2262] And it came about, or verse 5, as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp. That is, came into the military camp of Israel there at Aephek.
[time=2273] That all Israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth resounded. Now, let's back off a half a step and take a look at what's happened here.
[time=2286] When that battle with the Philistines was over, and they took that body count and found 4,000 men dead, they went back to that camp as verse 3 indicates a very depressed group of people.
[time=2300] Disbonded. Do you think they wanted to fight? Uh-uh. If they could have packed up their tents and gone home, I think they would have done it.
[time=2308] But the Ark has come into the camp. Here it is. Coming down the road from Shiloh. And the transformation that took place there is absolutely amazing.
[time=2319] Why that defeated group of people, that despondent, depressed army, is excited and ready to go. They're ready to fight.
[time=2330] You know, just hear them. Bring on those Philistine dogs. Round two is ours. They got us the first time, but the Ark's here and we're going to get them this time.
[time=2339] Yes, sir. Bring them on. We want them. Set up the tents, men. We're staying a while. We're going to get them this time. It's amazing.
[time=2349] It really is amazing when you look at it. What's happened? The transformation in this group.
[time=2356] What's even more interesting, however, is to go across the plane of APEC and look at the Philistine camp.
[time=2363] They are over there busy chilling their champagne. Victory celebration is going to be theirs. One more round, they'll knock the Israelites out and have a good time back at camp.
[time=2374] But let's look at verse six. And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout over in the Israelite camp, when the Ark arrived, they said,
[time=2387] "What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" Then they understood that the Ark of the Lord had come into the camp and the Philistines were afraid.
[time=2402] Isn't that something? Here's a group of people. You can just see them sitting around totally confident.
[time=2411] They threw their best at us last time and look how we cut them to shreds. Hey, no problem. Second round is going to be more of the same.
[time=2420] These folks are not a problem to us. And then what did they hear? Oh, they heard these shouts. Shouts of joy and gladness filtering across the plane of APEC.
[time=2433] They couldn't figure it out. This is not the attitude for a defeated people to have what's going on over there. And then they got the news.
[time=2443] The Ark of the God of Israel has come into the camp. Very interesting thing happened. Fear, like a brush fire totally out of control just swept through that Philistine camp.
[time=2462] Do you want to know why? Because the Philistines, they may not have been the most brilliant people that ever lived, but they didn't know their early Israelite history.
[time=2473] They knew about this God. They had heard how he had humbled mighty Pharaoh and had absolutely decimated the land of Egypt.
[time=2483] How the Red Sea had been opened up. And if you'll check Exodus out, you find that at that Red Sea incident, the word got back immediately to Canaan.
[time=2492] That these people were on the move and fear became resident in the hearts of the Canaanites from that point on.
[time=2499] They knew how this God had defeated two of the mightiest kings on the east side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og.
[time=2507] They had heard how this God had led the Israelites over the Jordan River. And then only 35 miles away lay the blackened ruins of Jericho.
[time=2517] A mute testimony to the power of this God. And to the knowledge of the Philistines, this God had never, ever been defeated.
[time=2528] No wrecker anywhere in their history books that this God had suffered defeat. And you can just see going through their minds, there he is.
[time=2538] He's over there. And we're about a mere regiment or two of Philistine soldiers, and here mighty nations have been dropped to their knees by this God.
[time=2550] What chance do we have? And now it is the Philistines, you see, who want to pack up their tents and go home in spite of having one round one.
[time=2563] That's interesting, isn't it? Misplaced faith. Israel was no more spiritually alert and alive in a right relationship with God than when they went up to battle the first time, but notice what's happened.
[time=2577] They have placed their faith, misplaced it, in the Ark of God, not in God himself.
[time=2585] Do you see what's happened? It's a pretty good stuff has happened. I mean, you've transformed Israel, you've transformed Philistia.
[time=2595] Everything is the way you want it. Misplaced faith. Ah, but what great dividends we're getting from it.
[time=2606] You know, that's interesting. Because that's the way life is, usually. That's the way it is with most of us.
[time=2616] When we are not living a life of real faith and active trust in the Lord, when our lives are not characterized by prayer, meaningful prayer, it doesn't seem to really make a whole lot of difference, does it?
[time=2632] We go on. And sometimes we do quite well. Thank you.
[time=2640] And sometimes the immediate results of this faith in ours that has not been placed in God, but in ourselves, our circumstances, or whatever seems to pay off.
[time=2656] And that's the way life is. But the scriptures tell us something.
[time=2666] They tell us that into every life, times of difficulty and intense problems come.
[time=2675] James, for example, phrases at something like this. When diverse temptations come into your life, and you'll notice that he says when they come into your life, not if they come into your life, you will get them.
[time=2694] Do you ever notice the Apostle Paul in his discussion of the armor of the Christian in Ephesians 6? He says something rather interesting in verse 13.
[time=2704] He tells us, keep on the armor of God that you may be able to stand. Do you ever notice when we need to be able to stand? He says in the evil day.
[time=2718] You know what that means? What it means is that not every day in the Christian's life is a day that is evil when there is demonic activity of temptation and trouble and pressures and everything else that the hosts of Satan do to us or wish to do to us.
[time=2738] But there are certain days that are evil days. Some of you today, it may be your experience that you are undergoing the evil day in your life.
[time=2753] And you see a person who is walking in a realistic faith and confidence and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ is going to be an individual who will be able to handle those days.
[time=2768] But you see, Satan doesn't bring all of those along every day. And so oftentimes we are not living lives of faith and confidence at all.
[time=2779] But life is good to us. Things seem to be going well. And that is the subtlety of misplaced faith.
[time=2790] I can imagine that back in the camp of Israel that the leaders were probably priding themselves on their keen insight.
[time=2798] The best military minds had come up with this scheme. And by the way, note that the text never says that they consulted the Lord.
[time=2807] Now when leaders consulted the Lord, it was usually recorded in the text. But look at the results.
[time=2814] The immediate results, absolutely fantastic. You couldn't write a script that would be better than what took place here.
[time=2825] But as you can guess, this is not the end of the story. So let's continue on.
[time=2832] Well, the generals of the Philistine army were not about to have their boys go home. Not when they felt they had the Israelites on the run.
[time=2842] So if you'll notice in verse 9, they give them two options. And essentially the two options are one, you stay and fight like men.
[time=2853] Your trained soldiers now fight. That's option one. Option two, you become slaves to the Israelites.
[time=2862] Now, there are some things worse than death to a Philistine. And one of them was to become an Israelites personal slave.
[time=2873] They only had one option, didn't they? Fight. Well, activate your imaginations. Here we are in the plane of Aefek.
[time=2882] It's a bright, sunny day as it usually is. The great battle trumpets Blair, and we can see the armies, this mass of humanity beginning to converge in the center of the plane.
[time=2896] And off to the Israelites side, they're shining in the bright Judean sun as the Ark of God.
[time=2903] And there's a confidence that the Israelites head into the middle of that battlefield.
[time=2909] The Philistines, they're kind of tiptoeing out there. They are not exactly enthusiastic about tangling with this God.
[time=2917] What happens? If you and I had been there that day, I imagine we would have seen a tremendous struggle taking place.
[time=2923] But even you and I would have observed that the Israelite armies began to back up. A breach occurred in their ranks.
[time=2934] And pretty soon it became obvious how the battle was going. The battle turned into a rout, and the Israelites turned and fled, and the rout turned into a slaughter.
[time=2948] The Philistines won. No question about it.
[time=2953] And once again in the scriptures, we are given a body count. And if you thought 4,000 was bad, take a look at this for one battle.
[time=2963] Verse 10 tells us that the slaughter was very great. For their fell of Israel, 30,000 foot soldiers.
[time=2975] 30,000 died in that one battle, that skirmish, they're at Afek.
[time=2983] It's interesting too to note in verse 11 that the Ark was taken captive by the Philistines. They captured God.
[time=2991] And they're thinking, the very thing that the Israelites trusted in was taken away from them.
[time=2999] The ultimate results of misplaced faith was death. Kind of clear, kind of obvious, isn't it?
[time=3011] The ultimate results of their faith not being placed in the Lord their God, but in a golden box, was death to 30,000 soldiers.
[time=3023] It's quite a consequence, isn't it? I can suppose, I can guess that that day some of these leaders who had prided themselves on their insight in getting the Ark there,
[time=3038] climbed to the top of the hill and looked over the plane of Afek.
[time=3043] And I can imagine one of them said something like this, brothers.
[time=3049] The will of God is hard to understand sometimes.
[time=3055] 30,000 of his soldiers died. It's hard to understand the God's will.
[time=3062] Brethren, all things work together for good to them who loved the Lord, quoting from Romans, which had not been written yet.
[time=3071] And the rest said, amen. I don't know, they did that. That's not in the text.
[time=3077] But you know, I have an idea that there were probably some who did do that because we are masters at covering up our misplaced faith with pious phraseology.
[time=3087] You know, I think a lot of things that come into our lives were never intended by God to be there.
[time=3092] God never designed that those particular set of problems and circumstances ever be ours.
[time=3099] But we have gotten used to passing off everything coming into our lives as the will of God for our lives and never thinking that perhaps what we are experiencing in our lives is the results of our misdirected faith.
[time=3115] The fact that as we walked through life, our confidence was not upon the Lord, our God.
[time=3121] It was on our own abilities to handle the situation or upon that group of people over there or this job or whatever it might have been.
[time=3131] It's a little bit harder for us to detect the results of misplaced faith in the life of a believer.
[time=3137] But you know, I think it sometimes comes out in what I call incipient forms of death.
[time=3143] It was kind of obvious, wasn't it, what the results of Israel's misplaced faith was?
[time=3148] Just go out and count the bodies. That's the result.
[time=3152] In the life of Christians, I think sometimes we reap things like anxiety and depression and worry and fear and sometimes even physical illnesses, things that God never designed to be a part of our experience, but they're there.
[time=3176] And they're there because realistically our walk with God has not been a walk that is genuine and real.
[time=3186] Again, I get back to the issue of our prayer life and our prayerlessness.
[time=3192] I am convinced, as I look at my own life, that the mark of whether or not I am walking, really walking and really living a life of faith and trust in the Lord Jesus my Savior is whether or not I am praying.
[time=3208] And whether my prayer life is a real prayer life or not.
[time=3215] You see, when the evil day comes, the ultimate results of either having a genuine trust or having misplaced my faith, it's in those kinds of settings oftentimes that the results will be seen negatively or positively.
[time=3235] How can you grow in faith and trust in God? I almost hate to say it because it is something you all know.
[time=3244] How does faith come? How does trust come? By hearing the Word of God.
[time=3251] And this is what is so significant about the role and the place of the Scriptures in our lives, not just that we're coming to understand facts, but that we are beginning to incorporate principles into our lives.
[time=3264] And living by them.
[time=3266] I was sharing with a group of students last night from the book of Proverbs.
[time=3273] In Proverbs 8.35, the writer says, "For he who finds me, referring to wisdom or the truth of God, finds life."
[time=3285] That that person learns how to live and handle the evil day and handle the temptations and problems of life because they understand what God is like and how God leads and acts and God's motives and God's thinking.
[time=3301] And not only that, he obtains favor from the Lord.
[time=3306] If I were to summarize this passage and the principle that comes out of it, I would summarize it something like this.
[time=3317] That the man, the woman, the individual who misplaces their faith, and we understand misplacing to be placing it anywhere else, but in the Lord God, the man or the woman who misplaces their faith.
[time=3335] Will ultimately reap tragic results.
[time=3340] Or we can phrase it positively.
[time=3343] That the person who actively places their confidence in the Lord God, that this person is going to reap the best in life.
[time=3356] I have found, in my personal experience, that most of you here have lived on both the positive and the negative side of this coin, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[time=3369] But this is a principle that is active whether we acknowledge it or not as believers.
[time=3379] And so I think one of the tests for us as believers is simply, are we people of prayer?
[time=3385] And I think that will give us a good idea of whether or not we are living in the delusion of some of the immediate results of misplaced faith, which often are good.
[time=3396] But there's another issue involved here.
[time=3399] And for those of you who perhaps have never come to that place in your life where you have made the greatest issue of trust or faith, placing it in Jesus Christ as your Savior, that we would say to you that that issue is in this passage as well.
[time=3418] If you are placing your confidence in any other thing or person other than in the Lord Jesus Christ, then ultimately you too will reap tragic and terrible results.
[time=3431] Conversely, you place your faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and you will have the blessings of eternal life.
[time=3439] Shall we pray together?
[time=3442] Our Father, we are so thankful.
