[time=27] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=35] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=80] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=87] Good morning. We welcome you to our morning worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=92] I want to say a special good morning to our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=98] This past week I was reading in a Christian journal, an article entitled "So You Think Your Church Has Problems."
[time=105] And it went on to say that the founder of the early church was being executed, Jesus Christ,
[time=111] that the chairman of the board, Peter, had denied he had ever been a part of the organization, that the treasurer, Judas, had run off with all the money. The rest of the board was nowhere to be found,
[time=122] and all that was left of the church was a few small groups praying in the upper room,
[time=128] so you think your church has trouble. Today we'll be studying Philippians, Paul's Prayer for the Church.
[time=134] Before that we'll be led in some special music and a time to sing together as believers, and now the choir leads us under the direction of Don Kruger and a song entitled "When I Kneel Down to Pray."
[time=169] And it's me and my father's soul. We call my wants and wishes known.
[time=188] Some of us say we sing a little clearer, When I give up to pray,
[time=200] When fellowship with give a little clearer, When I give up to pray,
[time=212] I know that we will always hear me, For me is never far away,
[time=224] When we're these things a little closer to me, When I give up to pray.
[time=242] A secret place of my invitation, When I give up to pray,
[time=256] It praises all the joy of every nation, When I give up to pray,
[time=269] I know that we will always hear me, For me is never far away,
[time=281] And that it seems a little closer to me, When I give up to pray,
[time=295] When I give up to pray,
[time=325] Thank you, choir. I have a special friend with me today, Mr. Gordon Kistler.
[time=331] Some of you have heard us talk about our student missions program, and Gordon Kistler was one of our summer missionaries this year.
[time=338] Gordon, would you share with the folks where you were this past summer?
[time=342] Yes, I traveled to Caribbean, Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, and Coursau.
[time=348] And what type of ministry was it that you people were involved with?
[time=351] I was involved with sports ambassadors, Division of Overseas Crusade, and what it was is actually sports evangelism.
[time=358] We played basketball, and at the halftime of every game we were given the program,
[time=364] and we would just present the gospel, sing and give testimonies of how Christ has changed our lives.
[time=369] It's easy for us to believe that Gordon is a basketball player, just how tall are you?
[time=374] Six-five, but with these shoes I'm probably six-seven.
[time=380] I think I need to get a pair of those shoes, and help me out a little bit.
[time=383] Gordon, you shared with me some of the personal highlights of this trip.
[time=386] Could you just share one of them with all of our family here?
[time=389] Sure. Something that happened at training camp before we even got started on the trip.
[time=395] I had been preparing all summer, the first half of the summer, for this trip, and was in very good shape, and so I thought at training camp the first day,
[time=406] we had all just gotten off the plane, and they just wanted to see us work out.
[time=411] And it was very unfortunate that I sprained my ankle.
[time=415] In fact, it was just maybe ten minutes into the practice.
[time=419] Well, everybody's trying to encourage me and tell me don't get down about it.
[time=424] It'll heal quick, you'll be ready to play by Mexico.
[time=427] I was ready to play by Mexico, not full strength, but I did play the first game and did very well.
[time=434] We won, but again I hurt my ankle.
[time=437] I was just really discouraged and trying to find what could I learn from this.
[time=444] God was certainly trying to teach me something, but Satan was doing his best to discourage me.
[time=451] So I just kept praying and reading the word, and I think maybe probably the second country we stopped at Curacao,
[time=461] I finally realized what it was and what I was learning and why God allowed this to happen to me.
[time=469] It was the fact that I had gone down there looking at the trip as a way to maybe increase my basketball ability and skills,
[time=477] and God didn't want that. God wanted it first to be his ministry, to use me.
[time=483] And he changed my priorities around.
[time=486] He made his ministry first, put basketball safe.
[time=491] Thank you, Gordon.
[time=492] That would be exciting to have the opportunity at halftime in a basketball game just to share the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=499] We have a second reason why we've invited Gordon here today.
[time=503] You've heard us talk about the film High Point, which we'll be showing in our auditorium tonight.
[time=508] Gordon is one of the students featured in that film.
[time=510] Gordon, how did it happen that you became a basketball player in a film star all in one summer?
[time=516] It was really by accident.
[time=519] I went down to the studio to watch my girlfriend do a screen test because she was involved with drama.
[time=525] And as soon as I walked in the door they said, "Who is that?" Because they noticed my height. And I said, "Don't even think about it. I will not act. I will not be involved.
[time=537] Just don't even think about it." And about an hour later they had me do a screen test.
[time=543] And I don't know, I just really am thankful that I got involved with the movie.
[time=549] I saw the film to preview it, and it's a story about how a high school student, a basketball player comes to Jesus Christ.
[time=556] And having known you for several years, Gordon, I saw some parallels in the film and in your life.
[time=560] Could you tell us a little about that?
[time=562] Sure. I think it portrays very well, probably my years in junior high and high school.
[time=569] For that fact I didn't have to act much, but it just shows me searching to find a place for God in my life.
[time=580] And it shows me searching for, say, ultimate highs. I was involved a lot with drinking and partying and heavy social life.
[time=590] And wasn't at all interested in what God could offer me on a full-time basis. I was a Sunday Christian.
[time=597] And I think you'll see that tonight if you come.
[time=600] And I just think the movie portrays well how many of us as young people just search in the wrong areas
[time=609] and get caught up in the wrong crowds.
[time=611] And I just think it's to a point where everyone in their life has to come to the point where God takes control.
[time=619] And we have to see that and realize that and take hold of God also.
[time=623] Thank you, Gordon. Appreciate your testimony.
[time=626] Now Dave Miller is going to come and sing for us, a reminder of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=633] This is his church and we are his people. And so Dave sings, Holy Spirit, you are welcome in this place.
[time=663] Holy Spirit, thou art well, come in this place.
[time=680] O Nipotent Father of mercy and grace, thou art well, come in this place.
[time=707] Lord in thy presence, there's healing divine.
[time=720] The Holy Spirit, thou art well, come in this place.
[time=747] Thou art well, come in this place.
[time=760] Fill all the hungry and empty within.
[time=772] Restore us, O Father, revive us again.
[time=786] Holy Spirit, thou art well, come in this place.
[time=799] Thou art well, come in this place.
[time=811] Holy Spirit, thou art well, come in this place.
[time=862] Thou art well, come in this place.
[time=880] Hello, thank you for joining the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=883] With me is my good friend Don Kruger. How are you today Don?
[time=886] I'm fine.
[time=887] I'm doing well also, particularly since I received this letter from one of our Founders Club members.
[time=892] I'd like to share it with our friends at home, Don. It's from Marie Trump and she writes, "Dear Don Kruger and Rick Hawks.
[time=901] I think you're doing very well in the days that we have heard you in the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=909] I will still be listening every Sunday on television and want both of you and all the others connected with the broadcast
[time=917] to know that you have my prayers and that my support of the Founders Club will continue.
[time=922] Yours truly, Marie Trump.
[time=925] That's such an encouraging letter, Rick, and I know many of you folk are interested in the Bible Hour.
[time=931] You have written to us and told us about your interest and we want you to continue to do that.
[time=935] Feel free to write and tell us if God has ministered to your heart through this ministry.
[time=940] You know Don, one of the ways we want to correspond back with our friends is through this new publication,
[time=946] which we call the Scroll.
[time=948] We're going to be sending it out to all of our Founders Club members.
[time=952] And what the scroll is, is a publication that will tell you a little bit of the inside story on some of the things that happen on the Bible Hour.
[time=960] This week there are several articles featuring you and I and Dale Siglin, the three men that work to produce the Bible Hour.
[time=968] And we want to share this with all of our viewers at home so that they can know the inside story of what happens here on the Bible Hour.
[time=977] You know, Rick, they say God answers prayer and we know that to be true.
[time=981] We have experienced that in our lives and many, many people have been praying for the Bible Hour and we appreciate your prayers.
[time=988] We really do. We've heard from many of you because of the financial needs that we have had and you have written in and shared with us of your finances and we appreciate that so much.
[time=998] But even more so, we want to be encouraged to know that you are praying for us.
[time=1004] Prayer is so very, very important.
[time=1006] And we just appreciate this letter that this dear lady sent and we want you to continue to do such things like that.
[time=1012] That lets us know that you are behind the Bible Hour, not only in a financial way and we do need your support but also in the way of your gifts and your prayers.
[time=1023] That's the greatest gift that you can give to the Bible Hour.
[time=1026] We have something that we've been sharing with the people and Rick has it here.
[time=1029] He's going to show it to you. It's the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=1033] For several weeks now, we've encouraged you to write in and receive this free gift, the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=1039] I'm personally encouraged by the use that I've had of it in my own life.
[time=1044] I've kept one of these inside my Bibles for several years now and found it to be a very helpful way of finding particular topics.
[time=1052] The Ready Reference Guide is a tool that is usable by everyone.
[time=1056] You don't have to be a professional Bible scholar to use the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=1061] This morning, I'll be speaking on the topic of Paul's Prayer for the People at Philippi.
[time=1066] And you could use this book to look up the topic of prayer and come down the list and you discover that there are a whole series of verses listed on prayer.
[time=1075] We want to make this available to you.
[time=1078] If you would simply write into us and ask for the Ready Reference Guide.
[time=1082] And our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1093] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1100] Now, in just a few minutes, we're going to be privileged to listen to Pastor Rick.
[time=1104] Many of you folk have not heard him and I would like to encourage you to stay tuned because Rick is a very, very fine preacher.
[time=1111] Some of you do not know that he has been the Minister of Youth here at our church for some four years.
[time=1116] It's four years now, isn't it?
[time=1117] Four years.
[time=1118] And just recently has taken the position of the Associate Pastor.
[time=1121] We'll be taking most of the responsibility of the pulpit ministry on the Bible Hour.
[time=1126] So you'll be able to get acquainted with him and hear him from week to week.
[time=1130] He's been a Minister of Youth in California and also in Akron, Ohio.
[time=1134] And we're so delighted to know that he is going to be heading our team as far as our ministry is concerned on the Bible Hour.
[time=1142] So in just a few minutes, we're going to be listening to Pastor Rick.
[time=1145] He is having a series called Triumphant Living.
[time=1149] This is a tremendous series of Bible study in the book of Philippians and our first message is this morning.
[time=1156] I'm looking forward to that, Pastor Rick.
[time=1158] Thank you, Don.
[time=1159] Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1162] Won't you write to us today?
[time=1164] Write to the Bible Hour.
[time=1166] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1169] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1173] Now, as we go back to the morning service, we're going to hear a song by Don and Janet Krueger.
[time=1179] Thank you again for joining us.
[time=1187] When you pray, will you pray for me?
[time=1201] All I need is love and is care.
[time=1209] When you pray, will you pray for me?
[time=1216] Will you whisper my name in your prayer?
[time=1224] At the close of the day, when you need you to pray, will you remember me?
[time=1239] I need help every day. This is why I pray.
[time=1247] Will you remember me?
[time=1255] When you pray, will you pray for me?
[time=1262] For I need is love and is care.
[time=1270] When you pray, will you pray for me?
[time=1278] Will you whisper my name in your prayer?
[time=1286] When I pray, I will pray for you.
[time=1293] For you need is love and is care.
[time=1302] When I pray, I will pray for you.
[time=1309] I will whisper your name in my prayer.
[time=1323] Thank you, Don and Janet, for that reminder to pray.
[time=1333] These last days we've been praying together as our school has started.
[time=1337] We've had a tremendous time, I'm teaching school this year and enjoying that a great deal.
[time=1342] If you have not enrolled your students in Black Hawk Christian School, we'd love to have them.
[time=1347] We encourage you to enroll during these first few days.
[time=1351] Then also another special event coming up the first weekend in October is our weekend of oneness.
[time=1358] A marriage enrichment retreat under the leadership of Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1363] Hope you'll take advantage of both of those special ministries.
[time=1366] Now, Lenna Peterson is going to come and sing for us.
[time=1370] Many times I have shared with you what an encouragement it is to my heart to hear songs taken from scripture.
[time=1376] And Lenna is our school secretary and is going to sing from us from 2nd Chronicles 7-14,
[time=1382] "If My People Who Are Called" by My Name.
[time=1415] Shall humble themselves, shall humble themselves, and pray.
[time=1432] "If My People Who Are Called" by My Name.
[time=1444] Shall seek My Grace, and turn from the weekend of my Grace.
[time=1460] Then will I hear from heaven, then will I hear from heaven, then will I hear, and will forgive.
[time=1484] I give this thing.
[time=1492] "If My People Who Are Called" by My Name.
[time=1503] Shall humble themselves, shall humble themselves, and pray.
[time=1516] I will forgive this thing.
[time=1542] "If My People Who Are Called" by My Name.
[time=1568] Shall humble themselves, shall humble themselves, and pray.
[time=1597] Thank you, Lenna.
[time=1603] We also appreciate Diane Medard playing the piano for us this morning.
[time=1608] That beautiful reminder of prayer, and that God answers prayer.
[time=1612] And if there comes from our heart a desire to be obedient to him, then God will answer our prayer and heal our land.
[time=1620] That's a beautiful song to be sung this morning before we study God's Word.
[time=1624] For today we open our Bibles to Philippians, the first chapter, and verses 8 through 11 where we discover Paul's prayer for the Philippians.
[time=1633] I'd like to read this passage for you.
[time=1636] Philippians 1 and verses 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
[time=1642] For God is my witness how greatly I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
[time=1651] And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more.
[time=1658] In more knowledge and in all judgment, that you may approve things that are excellent,
[time=1665] that you may be sincere without offense until the day of Christ.
[time=1671] Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.
[time=1681] It's interesting to observe the Apostle Paul's prayer.
[time=1685] He was writing to a group of people who we called the Philippians.
[time=1689] They were located in the city of Philippi.
[time=1691] Many years before this, a pistol was written "Puh" on his second missionary journey,
[time=1697] crossed over from Asia into Europe to the city of Philippi.
[time=1702] And there he met a group of people and established the first church on the continent of Europe.
[time=1709] Now years later Paul writes back that he is praying for those people.
[time=1714] It's interesting to me to observe the content of Paul's prayer.
[time=1718] I would think that somewhere in his prayer he would surely pray for the staff and the deacons.
[time=1724] If anyone needs prayer, it's the staff and the deacons.
[time=1727] The deacons think the staff needs prayer and the staff thinks the deacons need prayer.
[time=1731] And the truth is everybody in leadership needs prayer.
[time=1735] But surprisingly, there is no mention of prayer for those leaders.
[time=1740] Now the book is addressed to the leaders of the church.
[time=1743] It says in verse 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of God and of Christ Jesus to the saints
[time=1749] who are at Philippi with bishops.
[time=1752] That's the staff and deacons, the board of deacons, the leadership of the church.
[time=1756] But in his prayer he does not mention those people by name.
[time=1760] Then I thought, well perhaps Paul would pray for their program.
[time=1764] He might be praying for their living Christmas tree program or their patriotic panorama program.
[time=1770] He might pray for their youth ministries.
[time=1772] But there's really no mention of program.
[time=1775] We place an awful lot of importance on program and our culture today.
[time=1780] Our ministries, we believe, are alive and exciting.
[time=1784] So we have youth alive and singles alive and women alive.
[time=1788] I was announcing a basketball game here a few years ago and someone gave me a message.
[time=1792] It said please announce it for 75 cents, you can purchase a sausage alive.
[time=1797] I don't know if you're dead this morning, but if you ate one of those sausages you would truly be alive.
[time=1802] Programs, some statisticians have figured out that by 1984 that the hundreds of people
[time=1809] leaving Christmas tree in March will collide with the hundreds coming for the first patriotic panorama.
[time=1816] I believe those are great programs and they're important, but Paul didn't even pray for programs.
[time=1822] I would have thought that Paul would have had a section in his prayer marked off for the missionaries.
[time=1828] If anyone had a heart for missions, it was the apostle Paul.
[time=1832] He himself was a missionary set out by the church at Philippi.
[time=1836] And in chapter two we discover that they were laid in their missionary support.
[time=1840] And Paul might have prayed for the missionaries, but there's no mention of prayer for the missionaries.
[time=1846] I would have thought perhaps Paul would have prayed for their finances, but it's interesting at the bottom of the prayer bulletin.
[time=1852] There's no statistics as to a weekly giving, month to date, year to date, budget didn't received.
[time=1857] No mention of finances in his prayer.
[time=1860] And I thought perhaps he'll pray for their television or radio ministry, but strangely enough they don't occur.
[time=1867] Now if Paul really didn't pray for programs and he didn't pray for boards and he didn't pray for particular people
[time=1875] that were in need of prayer missionaries and those in the hospital, then for what did Paul pray?
[time=1881] Primarily he prayed for two things.
[time=1884] First he prayed for character, character in their lives, and secondly he prayed for their conduct.
[time=1894] Character and conduct.
[time=1897] This past week I was reading in an article entitled Evangelical newsletter and on the back of that was an article
[time=1904] that discussed why Evangelical born again Christianity has risen in such popularity and why it is the thing to do
[time=1913] as you enter the eighties to be a part of the born again movement.
[time=1918] And the writer went through some sociological reasons why the born again experience of Christianity has become so popular.
[time=1926] Obviously what plays into that is the fact that we've had two presidents in the row claim publicly to be born again individuals.
[time=1936] Both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan have shared openly of their faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1941] That has done much to give credibility.
[time=1944] But from that writer's viewpoint that was really insignificant as to why Christianity born again
[time=1951] Evangelical Christianity has risen in such prominence.
[time=1954] His basic premise was this.
[time=1957] The Christianity is now popular because it demands nothing in terms of an individual's lifestyle.
[time=1966] The Christianity has been so deluded that an individual can come to Jesus Christ and it absolutely demands nothing in terms of their character or their conduct.
[time=1978] And that a representation of people's lives reveals the fact that what they believe in their heart has actually translated into nothing in terms of their lifestyle.
[time=1989] And so Christianity has become a form of easy believism that you do not have to have a lifestyle that's compatible that's simply good to know that Jesus saves that we can all be born again
[time=2001] and we don't need to worry about who we are or how we live.
[time=2006] And so Christianity has within its ranks celebrities, prominent musicians, prominent athletes who we can ascribe praise to and we can idolize just as though they were secular heroes.
[time=2018] We have our top 40 10 charts in terms of music of what's the most popular music.
[time=2024] And Christianity has become its own little culture and it's really just a carbon copy of secular society and there is lacking within Christianity a demand on character and a demand on conduct.
[time=2037] And for that reason we now experience a tremendous rise in those who would say I've been born again.
[time=2045] Now as we come to Paul's prayer for the Philippians we encounter the importance of character and the importance of conduct.
[time=2054] He begins by saying and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more.
[time=2066] I remember back in the early 60s a young lady singing on the radio had a song by the name of what the world needs now.
[time=2074] Jackie Duchan and sang that song that said what the world needs now is love, sweet love.
[time=2080] That's the only thing that there's just too little love.
[time=2084] And I can agree with that concept that there's not enough love in our world.
[time=2089] That there's far more hate and there's far more prejudice and there's far more bitterness than there is love.
[time=2095] But yet it's important to know the concept of love that we speak about this morning.
[time=2101] But Paul prayed for these people that their love might abound.
[time=2105] It's important that we realize that he placed love first as he prayed for their character because love is first in the Bible.
[time=2113] If you were to flip to Galatians chapter 5 verse 22 you would list their nine different characteristics of the life of a believer.
[time=2123] First amongst those which Paul calls the fruit of the spirit is that characteristic of love.
[time=2131] More than anything else love is representative of the fact that the Spirit of God indwells our life.
[time=2138] Secondly love is preeminent because Jesus gave that as the mark of someone who was his disciple.
[time=2147] He said in John 1335 "by this shall all men know that your my disciples that you love one another."
[time=2156] Within our culture and the culture of antiquity there were ways of identifying your political or your religious beliefs.
[time=2166] And our culture and individual might wear a particular uniform.
[time=2169] That uniform distinguishes them as a part of a military branch of our government.
[time=2175] Religious leaders may wear a particular clerical garment to signify that they are in the ministry.
[time=2181] Individuals may wear a little lapel pen identifying that they hold party to a certain organization whether it be religious or not.
[time=2191] But Jesus was not saying that men will know that your my disciples by the clothes that you wear, by the little lapel pens that you carry so proudly are by your association and external appearance.
[time=2203] He said "by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you love one another."
[time=2210] It's the mark of a Christian.
[time=2213] The most important thing that people out of sense when they turn to this church and they come through these doors they should not be impressed with the carpet that's new or the building that's clean
[time=2224] or the way the auditoriums arrange they should be impressed with the fact that these people are strange.
[time=2231] There are peculiar people.
[time=2234] And they could sense there's a uniqueness.
[time=2237] And as they ponder that uniqueness they discover they love one another.
[time=2242] That should so emanate from our lives as believers that it becomes a testimony of character that we love one another.
[time=2250] Jesus said "by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you love one another."
[time=2257] One of the tremendous frustrations is to observe that more Christians spend time fighting each other
[time=2267] than they do fighting Satan.
[time=2270] Many churches make their stand a stand of what they're against in other churches or other denominations
[time=2278] and why they're not and they begin to list off different groups.
[time=2283] My friend if the world is to know the life changing power of Jesus Christ they have to know it not by what we stand against but what we stand for.
[time=2292] And the first thing we stand for is that Jesus Christ brings to our lives salvation and the characteristic of a life who has received the new birth is love one for another.
[time=2304] Love is first because it's first of the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=2308] It is first as the mark of Christ's likeness.
[time=2311] It is also first and greatest amongst all the Christian virtues.
[time=2315] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13-13 these words.
[time=2320] And now abideth faith, hope and love.
[time=2327] But the greatest of these is love.
[time=2332] Of all the virtues a person could possess the greatest virtue is love.
[time=2339] It would be interesting to observe an application for employment.
[time=2343] And as they check off references is the person dependable?
[time=2347] Is the person conscientious?
[time=2349] Is the person well liked so oftentimes we miss the key virtue?
[time=2353] Is that person a loving, caring person?
[time=2357] The greatest virtue a Christian can demonstrate is love.
[time=2362] Love is not only the greatest virtue but love has to be the generating source of power for every act of Christian service.
[time=2371] Paul said these words in 1 Corinthians 13 the great chapter on love he said this in verses 1 through 3.
[time=2380] Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not love I am become as a sounding bronze or a tinkling symbol.
[time=2393] And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and have all knowledge and though I have faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I'm nothing.
[time=2407] And though I but still all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not love it profits me nothing.
[time=2419] You see men and women behind every act of Christian service there has to be the heartfelt pressure and driving force that we love one another.
[time=2429] God is able to take the smallest most minute gift that is given in love and multiply it into abundance.
[time=2438] Jesus was able to take one carry out lunch from Arthur Treacher's and multiply it into enough food to feed 5,000 people.
[time=2447] He could take that small boy's lunch and feed him altitude.
[time=2451] Jesus could take the widow's might and he could multiply that to his own glory to supply the every need of the hour.
[time=2458] And in the same token if our acts of Christian service if the labor of our hands and the giving that we produce is not born out of an attitude of love it could go to the greatest knot that history has ever seen.
[time=2474] Behind every act of Christian service there has to be the compelling driving force of love.
[time=2481] If our lives simply produce character and conduct that is devoid of love then we are that which Isaiah the prophet spoke of when he said all of your acts of righteousness stand before God as filthy rags.
[time=2497] If there is not a proper spirit a heart that generates that. You see Jesus Christ was more concerned about the minister than he was the ministry.
[time=2509] He was more concerned about the attitude of the heart than he was the activity of the hands.
[time=2515] Jesus Christ and Paul were concerned about character and the greatest character is love.
[time=2524] So when they came those who had tried to entrap Jesus and tried to trick him Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes would come with their conniving question trying to trick him.
[time=2536] And a scribe comes and says Jesus what is the greatest commandment and all the law hoping to trap him into a petty little argument that they might dissuade the masses from following him.
[time=2548] And without a moment's notice the scripture indicates that Jesus says the greatest commandment is this that thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might.
[time=2560] And the second is liken unto it.
[time=2562] And thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.
[time=2566] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
[time=2572] You see the greatest commandment is that we love God first and our fellow man second.
[time=2578] And so Paul would pray for character in their life that they would be people of love.
[time=2583] And it's interesting to observe that love is given often as a commandment.
[time=2587] Jesus said the greatest commandment is this that you love God.
[time=2592] Time and time again in the Bible the word love comes to us in the imperative mood in the force of a commandment.
[time=2600] Jesus says love a commandment love your enemies.
[time=2604] 1 John 2 15 says love not the world those are commandments.
[time=2610] Time and time again the Bible speaks of a commandment of love.
[time=2614] Jesus said in this commandment I give you that you love one another.
[time=2618] 1 John tells us John writing a new commandment that I gave you yet not a new commandment one that you have had from the beginning that you love one another.
[time=2627] You see love is not a subjective blind emotion.
[time=2632] Love is an objective decision of the heart and will that says I will place value on you and I will treasure you and I will love you.
[time=2642] So often we meet those who talk about love as though it's a passive emotion that you're just kind of strolling through life and I fell in love.
[time=2650] As though there's there's huge hole out there in life and you just happened to pick her punk and once you hit the bottom of that whole love you discover a familiar face and I say well since we're in the same hole I guess we love each other.
[time=2662] Now I've fallen into some holes.
[time=2666] Remember going golfing with my father he is an excellent golfer and as good as he golfs I'm just about good at that good at slicing.
[time=2675] So I'm usually about two holes away in the wrong fairway.
[time=2679] We're playing the ninth hole he belts a drive out there straight as a whistle and I slice one out there as big as a banana.
[time=2685] Goes right across this little creek.
[time=2688] Now the bridge is on the left I'm 400 yards on the right.
[time=2692] And so I head over to my bottom my dad says you can't go over there there's not a bridge and I said oh dad I'll just jump the creek.
[time=2699] He says you can't jump that creek. I said dad I can jump that creek with my clubs and yours both.
[time=2705] Okay I go there I jump the creek. I cleared it like a real champ.
[time=2709] What I did know is on the other side of the creek what's called a peat moss bog and I sunk down into my knee.
[time=2716] When I tugged to get out of that hole I left my shoe three foot down in the ground.
[time=2722] And to this day if I go that golf course the greenskeeper says you need your shoes cleaned.
[time=2727] What an embarrassment to fall into a hole. This past week a friend in the funeral business shared with me that he was at a service one time and the minister fell into the grave.
[time=2737] I don't know what holes you have fallen into lately but love is not a hole that you fall into.
[time=2745] There's not a little area on the map that says love and you just kind of fall into it.
[time=2751] Love is an activity an action of the will that places value on someone.
[time=2759] You see love is a commandment of God that we love him and that we love one another.
[time=2764] And if people are to know that we're disciples of Jesus Christ then they must see in our life love.
[time=2771] It's not a passive activity. It's a live, vibrant, dynamic choice of our will that we be men and women who love one another.
[time=2782] Not only is love first as the fruit of the spirit. Not only is love the greatest of the Christian virtues.
[time=2789] Not only is love the pattern of Christ's likeness. Not only is love the first and greatest of all the commandments.
[time=2796] Love is also the cena quo known. That which out which not for a Christian.
[time=2803] If love is absent in our life then there's great possibility that God is absent from our life.
[time=2810] Turn in your Bible with me if you will to 1 John and the 4th chapter.
[time=2815] In the book of 1 John we encounter the word love many many times.
[time=2820] As a matter of fact the word love is one of the most prominent words in the entire New Testament.
[time=2827] This word, agape and the noun agapeo the verb the same root occurs 257 times in the pages of the New Testament alone.
[time=2840] It is given to us as the characteristic of a life that truly is possessed by God and a life that truly possesses the spirit of God.
[time=2851] 1 John 4 7 and 8. Beloved let us love one another. For love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knows God.
[time=2867] He that loveth not knows not God.
[time=2872] What John was saying is this that if we are truly a born again individual and the spirit of God lives in our heart then it will be manifested in the character of our lives that we love people.
[time=2884] 1 John 4 19. We love him because he first loved us. If a man says I love God and hates his brother he is a liar.
[time=2898] For he that loveth not his brother whom he has not seen how can he love God whom he has not seen.
[time=2905] If we are not demonstrating love in the very character of our lives then it is tremendous indication that the spirit of God may be strangely absent from our life.
[time=2917] The mark of a Christian is that we love one another.
[time=2922] Now you know men and women it's easy to love those people who are like us. It's easy to love people who believe what I believe.
[time=2933] It's easy to love people who dress the way I dress. It's easy to love people who make choices that I want them to make.
[time=2942] But it's far more difficult to love someone who looks strange to you and looks different to you.
[time=2948] It's very difficult to love someone who comes from a different social economic background.
[time=2954] It's hard to love someone who makes choices that you disagree with.
[time=2959] It's hard to love a neighbor who plays his music loud at midnight.
[time=2964] It's difficult to love that neighbor whose young person is so rebellious that you can hear the family tension at all hours of the day.
[time=2973] It's difficult to love someone who is different but that's where Christianity is proved.
[time=2980] That we love one another even though we may disagree.
[time=2984] It was a tremendous encouragement to my own heart this last week on Wednesday night in this auditorium we conducted a business meeting.
[time=2993] In that business meeting there were opinions that were given.
[time=2997] There were those that disagreed and had a different opinion.
[time=3001] Men and women the mark of Christianity is not that this person and this person agree on everything
[time=3007] but that this person and this person who disagree love one another.
[time=3012] One of the men on our board often says you can disagree just don't be disagreeable.
[time=3019] Christianity is proven when we have differences of doctrine, when we have differences of procedure, when we have differences of social values
[time=3029] and yet within those differences there is a bond and a unity that I love that person.
[time=3035] You know if you come to this church today because you agree with us doctrinally and you agree with us practically
[time=3043] and you agree with our stands on social political issues you're going to be disappointed and frustrated.
[time=3050] There's thirteen hundred of us.
[time=3052] We don't all agree on every issue but what we do agree on is Jesus Christ is the Son of God
[time=3058] and the Bible is His words and it gives life and direction today.
[time=3062] You may disagree on a financial matter.
[time=3065] You may disagree on the selection of a particular person to serve in the ministry but yet there can be a unity because we love one another.
[time=3074] Love is proved not that everyone agrees but that when people disagree there is a commitment to love one another
[time=3082] that supersedes and far surpasses that disagreement.
[time=3086] Paul prayed for their lives that they might have the character of love.
[time=3091] That that character might abound yet more and more.
[time=3096] He was making a superlative description, a description that illustrates an immeasurable amount of love that their love might overflow.
[time=3107] Yet within that abundance there also has to be direction.
[time=3111] And so Paul would pray back in Philippians chapter one that their love might abound yet more and more in all knowledge
[time=3119] in all judgment that you might approve things that are excellent.
[time=3125] It's important that when we come to the concept of love that we approach that concept with definition and understanding.
[time=3135] It is important that we love but it's important that our love have knowledge that that knowledge give insight in the living.
[time=3144] I was with a friend this past weekend who was a basketball and football coach and he also referees
[time=3150] and he shared a humorous story about going to referee a basketball game for a small Christian school.
[time=3157] And he began to share how they had a program but they really didn't even understand the game.
[time=3163] And so the coach from this school came out and said, "Well, how are we going to start the game?
[time=3167] Shall we flip a coin?" And my friend said, "No, I think we'll just have a jump ball." And the coach responded, "Oh, well that's a good idea." He'd be able to say, "How can a guy be a basketball coach when he really doesn't have the knowledge of the game?"
[time=3183] Knowledge is essential to participation in a sport.
[time=3187] Knowledge is essential to the demonstration of our love.
[time=3192] The knowledge that gives direction is primarily the word of God.
[time=3198] That within it, it gives knowledge.
[time=3201] It gives difficult knowledge.
[time=3203] It gives us difficult knowledge that says we are to love our enemies.
[time=3208] It gives troubling knowledge because it says love not the world nor the things of the world.
[time=3214] And there comes direction as to how we live.
[time=3218] Knowledge. Then coupled with that knowledge is judgment or discernment.
[time=3224] Primarily that discernment comes through the spirit of God.
[time=3228] Knowledge, the word of God discernment, the spirit of God.
[time=3232] And so when an individual says, "I love you and I love someone that is channeled and directed by knowledge and by the Holy Spirit."
[time=3242] And that produces the effect that we can approve the things that are excellent.
[time=3250] Love, channeled through knowledge, filtered through the Holy Spirit causes us to produce right decisions in life.
[time=3258] We approve the things that are excellent.
[time=3262] Let me make an illustration.
[time=3264] Love is one of the most nebulous and misused words in our society.
[time=3269] We use love to describe our relationship, describing everything from ice cream to our spouse.
[time=3276] Love is used to describe our devotion to God, and yet another person might use love to describe an act of sexual self-gratification.
[time=3285] Love. That's why there's the need for knowledge.
[time=3288] And so an individual is out.
[time=3290] With another person, that person says, "I love you, will you make love to me?" And they use the common words in the right language, and they talk about love.
[time=3300] But then there must come knowledge to that love.
[time=3304] And the word of God supplies the knowledge that our bodies belong to God and our bodies are not for immorality.
[time=3310] And so that knowledge begins to ring an alarm.
[time=3313] And then the Holy Spirit gives the discernment, the insight to say, "That is not God's will that I need to stand tall and resist."
[time=3322] And the Spirit of God gives conviction and confidence, judgment, which produces a right decision to say no.
[time=3330] No is the strangest word in the English language.
[time=3333] We have a 21-month-old daughter.
[time=3335] Her first word was no.
[time=3338] When she wanted something, she said no.
[time=3343] When she couldn't think of anything to say, she said no.
[time=3346] And the real little ones have a hard time not saying no, and then you encounter those who are teenagers or adults in a quote midlife crisis.
[time=3354] We discover they don't know how to say no.
[time=3359] Knowledge begins to give direction to our love.
[time=3364] The Spirit of God gives conviction and judgment to that love, and it produces Godly living in right decisions in our heart.
[time=3373] This morning, we've talked about the character of love.
[time=3376] Next week, we'll move into this prayer and we'll discover Paul talks about conduct.
[time=3381] But the character and the conduct were really his prayer as intermediate goals, the ultimate goal, verse 11.
[time=3390] I'm to the glory and the praise of God.
[time=3395] This is God's design for our lives, that we praise Him, that we glorify Him, and our potential to praise and glorify God is the relationship of our character, our love, multiplied by our conduct, result to the praise and glory of God.
[time=3415] We praise Him today, not just by the songs that our lips can sing, or the activity of our hands, we praise Him today by a dedicated character committed to Jesus Christ.
[time=3428] Today, have you made that commitment to Him?
[time=3431] I pray that you have.
[time=3433] Let's pray together.
[time=3435] This morning, we've talked about character in our lives, character that reflects dedication to Jesus Christ.
[time=3444] Do you know Him today if not receive Him?
[time=3447] We're going to pray, and as we pray we ask Him.
