[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=30] (crowd chattering)
[time=60] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=91] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=99] Good morning, and we wanna welcome you
[time=106] to our worship service this morning at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and say a special word of welcome to our Bible, our family that is joining us by television at this time.
[time=117] This morning, we'll be studying Paul's prayer for the Philippians as he prayed for their conduct that they might live a life that is representing Jesus Christ to his praise and to his glory.
[time=129] But before that time, we'll have an opportunity to sing praises to our God and to hear from our choir and some special musicians today enriching our lives through the ministry of music.
[time=140] Now, under the leadership of Don Kruger, the choir is going to sing for us a worship melody.
[time=146] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 296 seconds]
[time=452] - Thank you, Choir, that thrills our hearts
[time=471] to hear the majesty that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=475] Many of you know Dr. Ken Nichols as a Sunday school teacher or as a speaker at our church, but you might not be familiar with the Alive Counseling Center so I've asked Ken to come share some information about that this morning.
[time=488] I have a question, why do you call it the Alive Counseling Center?
[time=492] - One of the things that the Counseling Center tries to emphasize Pastor Rick is the area of prevention.
[time=500] By that I mean in the field of psychology as well as medicine, historically the emphasis has been on pathology and problems and disease and the causes of all of that.
[time=510] And doctors today in fact a recent AMA survey illustrated that 90% of the people today who come into the medical doctor for help, 90% cannot actually receive help for some of the origin and some of the cause of that.
[time=525] The same is in the field of psychology.
[time=528] People come in with difficulties and problems and the primary need is to work more and more in the area of prevention.
[time=536] And that is why we named our Counseling Center the Alive Counseling Center, always living in view of eternity.
[time=544] Simply meaning that we believe that as people order their life according to God's program and initiate and apply biblical principles they can avoid many, many difficulties, physically and emotionally.
[time=557] - So the idea of preventative counseling then is that you work with people to help them prepare for difficulties before they come.
[time=564] What would be some of the programs or ideas that you have in that area?
[time=568] - The Counseling Center I suppose does that in many different ways.
[time=572] You've mentioned already the involvement in specialized seminars for parents and teens and then each August providing a series of seminars for our church.
[time=581] In addition to that we are publishing some literature.
[time=583] In fact, beginning in just a few weeks our associate Mr. Ed Ward will be doing a whole series on stress.
[time=590] The title of the series is Strategy for Living.
[time=593] So we try to provide written information, tapes, seminars coming up in October.
[time=599] Here at our local church we have a Lake Councilor Training Program.
[time=604] The program simply is our desire to train 30 laymen in the area of counseling and counseling principles believing that we can multiply our ministry by training other people in the body of Christ to minister one to another.
[time=618] So that's a preventative way helping each other.
[time=621] So seminar series, retreats, and things of that nature.
[time=625] - Now, suppose an individual wanted to receive personal help.
[time=629] I know you're a licensed psychologist by the state of Indiana.
[time=632] You've got a doctorate degree in that.
[time=633] If they wanted to receive help or they wanted to get in one of these special programs how would they do that?
[time=639] - Simply by writing to the church or calling the church office or the counseling center and asking for further information about the Lake Councilor Training Program or the retreats.
[time=648] As a matter of fact, we have coming up in just a few weeks Couples Retreat entitled Weekend of Oneness.
[time=656] Consistent with my previous remarks, it is preventative in this sense.
[time=660] We will not be spending all of our time and energy discussing all the major conflicts and problems that are normally talked about in marriage.
[time=668] We want to spend our time and energy focusing in on the Word of God and also on very practical life principles on how to continue to maintain meaningful marriage and how to prevent difficulties in the marriage relationship.
[time=680] - Thank you, Ken, for sharing that.
[time=682] I know as a seminary student, the area that was most needed in education was the ability to counsel people and to give them biblical advice as it related to their emotions, their mind and their will.
[time=694] We're so thankful to have him as a part of our team here to lend that area of expertise.
[time=700] Don Kruger, our Minister of Music, is also an accomplished musician as a performer, not only in directing others, and he comes to sing for us a classical Christian song, "His Eyes on the Sparrow," and I know he watches me.
[time=716] (gentle music)
[time=730] (birds chirping) [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=934] - Hello, thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today.
[time=946] With me is my friend Don Kruger who just led the choir in that great hymn about the Lordship of Jesus Christ and then sang that song of encouragement for us today.
[time=956] We have some letters that we have received here at the Bible Hour Office which has been a special encouragement to Don and I.
[time=964] Some of the letters have just shared how the ministry is touching people's lives and that is such an encouragement to us.
[time=971] I hope that you'll take the time today to write to us and let us know if the ministry of music and of the Word of God has been an encouragement to your life.
[time=981] - Rick, here's a letter from the Anderson family and they write to us and say, "Dear Pastor Hawks, we tuned in the Bible Hour at 11 a.m. on September the 6th, not knowing just what to expect.
[time=994] It wasn't easy for us to give up Pastor Jeremiah but we had prayed that the new pastor would ably meet the challenge and he did.
[time=1003] With your confidence, experience, knowledge of the Bible plus God's leading, it looks encouraging for the future of the Bible Hour.
[time=1012] Thank you sincerely the AW Anderson family and we certainly appreciate this letter and if you have been blessed by the ministry of the Bible Hour or if you would like to encourage Pastor Rick by telling him that his message has been a blessing to your own heart we'd love to hear from you.
[time=1028] This letter is just such an encouragement to us and it really helps us on the Bible Hour.
[time=1033] The Word of God says that we should be helpers, one to another, bear one another's burdens, be a help and an encouragement to one another and this letter is certainly an encouragement.
[time=1044] That letter was indeed encouraging to me personally and here are some things that you could do that would help us through these days of transition and change on the Bible Hour.
[time=1054] First of all, won't you please be faithful and praying for us, pray for dawn as he leads the choir and he studies music to present special songs that would be challenging and encouraging to our spiritual lives and then be praying for me that as I study God's Word that his spirit wouldn't fill my heart overflowing, that I would have a message from God to present to you each week.
[time=1080] Then also pray for those who work behind the scenes, the technicians and the producers and the directors that make the Bible Hour come alive every Sunday so that we can share this ministry with you.
[time=1092] Please be praying for all of us.
[time=1094] Then secondly, you can encourage us by writing in and letting us know that you're there, that you're watching the Bible Hour and that God is using it in your life.
[time=1104] Then finally, you can help us by being a partner in giving financially.
[time=1109] The Bible Hour comes each week to you because people who are being blessed by the ministry are giving and so we ask you to be faithful supporters of the Bible Hour.
[time=1120] Each week we've been sharing with you a little booklet that is so helpful for a personal Bible study.
[time=1127] It's entitled, "The Ready Reference Guide." And Don has a copy of that with him this morning to share with you.
[time=1134] Pastor Rick, this is a handy little tool for Bible study and many people have heard about it but you haven't taken the opportunity yet to write and we would like you to write to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and request your copy of "The Ready Reference Guide." It's a handy little tool.
[time=1156] It comes with an adhesive back that you put in your Bible and there are over 100 topics of encouragement.
[time=1163] Like for instance, humility and you wanna find a verse on humility quickly, you look at the Ready Reference Guide and it shows you and prayer and rapture, the return of Christ, et cetera.
[time=1174] You just look here and there are many references to scripture verses that will be a help to you.
[time=1180] You can get them very, very easily.
[time=1182] The Ready Reference Guide, just right to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1191] We hope that you'll write in today and request the Ready Reference Guide and send along the note of encouragement and perhaps a gift to help the Bible Hour.
[time=1203] This morning, the Bible Hour is being sponsored by George and Barbara Strong and they're sponsoring the Bible Hour in honor of Barbara's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Van Adden and we're so thankful for their support.
[time=1219] They actually wanted to sponsor the Bible Hour last week and we're a bit late in sharing the information with you.
[time=1225] Thank you again for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1242] (gentle music)
[time=1271] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=1413] (gentle music) - Thank you, Al and Lenna for that song
[time=1422] reminding us of the love of God that's in Christ Jesus.
[time=1427] I wanna just give you a special reminder about the weekend of oneness.
[time=1432] It's being held this year in Winona Lake, Indiana, just an hour from those of us who live in Fort Wayne and a little closer to our TV friends who live in South Bend and Chicago and Indianapolis.
[time=1444] And that's open not only to our church family but also to the folks who are part of our television viewing audience.
[time=1451] A good way of introducing our next soloist is that she is Marlene Nichols, who is the wife of Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1458] And she's coming to sing for us this morning through it all.
[time=1462] A great song talking about the love of God that takes us through the trials of life.
[time=1467] Marlene Nichols.
[time=1468] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 191 seconds]
[time=1665] - Thank you, Marlene, for that reminder
[time=1672] that God loves us through it all.
[time=1675] God promised not to keep us from the valley of the shadow of death, but that He had walked through that valley with us.
[time=1682] Never promised to keep us from the storms of life, but He did promise that when those storms came, He'd cause our life to stand as though we were a house built upon a solid rock.
[time=1695] One of my hobbies as a young person was the study of U.S. presidents.
[time=1700] Through something you ordered off the box of a package of serials, I got pictures of all the presidents in the United States.
[time=1707] I began learning little facts of interest to me.
[time=1711] I remember learning that James Madison was the shortest president we ever had, that James Buchanan was the only president to never marry.
[time=1719] But an interesting fact that I've enjoyed is that while he was president of the United States, Gerald Ford took his Golden Labrador Retriever for a walk out around the grounds of the White House.
[time=1731] When he came back to get in, the White House was locked and he couldn't get in.
[time=1736] The President of the United States slept half the night outside a locked door of the White House in his pajamas and slippers with his Golden Labrador Retriever.
[time=1746] Then I read the menu when FDR hosted the King and Queen of England in the White House.
[time=1752] Royalty came and they began to serve an elegant meal, a very traditional American meal of great eloquence.
[time=1760] They had hot dogs.
[time=1762] That may help some of you wives today who haven't put a roast in the oven to go home and to share hot dogs with your family.
[time=1769] You can tell what's the dinner of presidents and kings and queens.
[time=1774] I like studying those lives of presidents and all of us have an interest in the lives of people of importance and people who are in the public eye.
[time=1785] But you know that you and I as Christians hold that exact same position in the public eye.
[time=1792] Those who do not know Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior, look at you and they look at me to examine what is a Christian.
[time=1803] How does a Christian live?
[time=1805] And they make an investigation as to the validity of Jesus Christ by examining the character and by examining the conduct of our lives.
[time=1816] It's important then that we study God's word that we learn how we ought to live so that we can in the best way possible be like a city set upon a hill that sends forth lights and cannot be hidden, that the light of our life, Jesus Christ could shine forth and others would see by the character of our life and by our conduct that he is alive and he changes lives today.
[time=1844] Paul prayed for that as he prayed for the Philippians.
[time=1848] So we invite you today to open your Bibles to Philippians chapter one that we might study Paul's prayer for the Philippians.
[time=1857] Last week we began this study and we observed that Paul prayed first of all for their character, that they might have the characteristic description of love.
[time=1867] It was Jesus who said, "By this shall all men know "that you are my disciples that you love one another." So Paul prayed that their love might abound yet more and more.
[time=1881] And in the middle of his prayer he introduces a new concern, a concern for conduct.
[time=1888] And so in the second part of verse 10 we pick up Paul's prayer as he continues.
[time=1895] He says that you may be sincere without offense until the day of Jesus Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Christ Jesus unto glory and the praise of God.
[time=1915] Paul prayed for their character and their conduct that they might be sincere and that they might be blameless.
[time=1924] One of the classes I struggled with most of all is Latin.
[time=1929] I took Latin in junior high school because that was the easiest teacher in the junior high.
[time=1934] So I took Latin, spent a whole year, really didn't learn any Latin.
[time=1939] And I came to my second year of Latin and there at the high school was about a 70 year old teacher.
[time=1947] He looked a little closer to 170 and he was a classical Latin teacher with discipline.
[time=1953] And he used to drill us on those Latin vocabulary words.
[time=1958] That was about 15 years ago.
[time=1961] For the first time in my life, Latin has value to me today because this little word sincere is a combination of two Latin words.
[time=1969] Cine without carer's wax.
[time=1974] Sincere means to be without wax.
[time=1976] Now you say what on earth does that have to do with Christianity?
[time=1981] Well, back in the times that the Bible was written, elegant pottery was made out of porcelain.
[time=1989] And you could make porcelain rather easily if you allowed it to be a thick walled base.
[time=1996] But that really wasn't the top quality porcelain.
[time=1999] The better porcelain was thin walled, extremely fragile.
[time=2004] And oftentimes the craftsman would make a porcelain base with very thin walls.
[time=2010] Beautiful, the class pottery.
[time=2014] And as he would place it into the oven to fire it, the heat would cause that thin porcelain to crack.
[time=2021] And when it was taken out, there would be a hairline crack, a flaw in the workmanship.
[time=2027] An unscrupulous man would take wax and he would rub wax on that hot pottery.
[time=2033] And the wax would fill the crack and smooth it over.
[time=2036] And as you came into the shop, you would pick up this porcelain base and you would hold it and it would be beautiful.
[time=2043] It looked absolutely perfect because the wax had camouflaged all of the imperfections.
[time=2050] It was a wax covering of the fault.
[time=2056] And the word sincere means that you and I, as Christians, do not try to wax over our deficiencies.
[time=2064] That an individual who is sincere is someone who allows their life to be examined for who they are and for what they are.
[time=2071] And there's not a spiritual camouflage and insincerity about them, a false piety.
[time=2078] I don't know if you like pretzels, but we buy lots of pretzels in our house.
[time=2083] And at the bottom of the box, there's a little disclaimer.
[time=2086] The disclaimer goes like this.
[time=2088] It says this box is sold by weight and not by volume.
[time=2093] That's to prepare you for when you open the box and you discover that it's only half full.
[time=2101] Now the reason why manufacturers do that is the larger the box, it makes it appear that boy, this is really a good value.
[time=2110] So you buy it, you go home and it's not until you get home and you discover that you bought a lot of air.
[time=2116] Then there's that little disclaimer that says this package sold by weight and not by volume.
[time=2124] In the marketing industry, there is always an attempt to make a product look bigger and better than it is in sincerity.
[time=2134] So many times, we as believers in Jesus Christ try to make ourselves look bigger and better than we are.
[time=2144] Sincerity demands that we represent our lives just as we are.
[time=2152] Without filling in the cracks with wax, without trying to camouflage the inefficiencies, but that we just represent our lives for what they are.
[time=2162] The real word in Greek means to examine in the sunlight.
[time=2169] From time to time, I wake up earlier in the rest of my family and I get dressed by a dim light and I'll reach in the closet, pull out a pair of dark socks and get dressed, go off to the activities of the day, sit down about 10 o'clock somewhere and cross my legs and I discover something about my socks.
[time=2188] They really look good in that dim light, but now that I'm out in the sunlight, I discover one of them is navy blue and the other is black, which really is a big problem when you wore a brown suit on that day.
[time=2201] It's amazing the decisions that we can make when we're hiding in dim light that suddenly are revealed when we come into bright light.
[time=2211] The word of God is saying that our lives are to be sincere, that they're to be exposed in the light.
[time=2218] And if you were to take one of those porcelain vases that had been camouflaged with the wax and you were to take it and hold it out into the bright light, anyone could see the crack through the clear wax that wasn't so obvious when it was in the shop.
[time=2235] That wax might even begin to melt under the heat of the light and a frustrated merchant would come back into the shop and he would look for the little word sincere and a merchant would hang a sign sincere, which meant without wax.
[time=2252] Too many times there was no sign.
[time=2257] Sincere, without wax.
[time=2260] You know, as believers in Jesus Christ, the word of God says God has taken the message of salvation, the treasury of God's plan and he has placed it into earthen are clay pots.
[time=2274] Second Corinthians, the fourth chapter says God has placed the glory of God, the salvation that's in Christ in clay pots, those pots get broken.
[time=2285] The handles get chipped off.
[time=2287] There are nicks upon the artistry of the lip.
[time=2291] And the question then comes as believers in Jesus Christ, carrying in our clay pots this human vessel, the treasure of the knowledge of God, will we try to cover up our deficiencies and cover them with wax?
[time=2307] Or will we represent our life for who we are and for what we are?
[time=2313] The opposite of sincerity is hypocrisy.
[time=2318] Hypocrisy simply means to play the part, to act out the role and is a common criticism of a church, of an individual that that church is full of nothing but hypocrites.
[time=2331] People who just play the part.
[time=2334] You know, very few people who do not confess Christ to save your expect you and I to be perfect.
[time=2341] Very few people really expect that of a Christian.
[time=2345] But they do expect sincerity that we do not cover up our deficiencies, but we let them show.
[time=2353] A recent television commercial, advertising one type of television, shows a couple going in to buy a television of another name brand.
[time=2363] And they ask the salesman about the warranty and he goes, my, my, my, look at this beautiful picture.
[time=2369] And they say, how about the warranty?
[time=2371] He says, and notice the color.
[time=2373] Isn't it sharp and clear?
[time=2376] What about the warranty?
[time=2377] And look at this cabinet, genuine plastic.
[time=2381] What about the warranty?
[time=2383] Oh, we have none.
[time=2384] No, sometimes we do that as Christians.
[time=2388] Someone begins to discover a weakness in our life.
[time=2392] And as they probe on that weakness, we begin to say, you know, God has really answered some of my prayers lately.
[time=2400] They begin to touch that weakness and we say, you know, I've been studying in the wood of God.
[time=2405] And they become this super spiritual past person because we're probing in a touchy area.
[time=2411] And there's this wax that we all bring out to put on this great external exposure that we as a Christians, we are the finest porcelain.
[time=2421] But really it's cracked.
[time=2424] We're trying to fill in with wax and to cover up.
[time=2429] You know, in that attempt, we sometimes believe that we're helping Jesus Christ by not allowing people to see our weakness.
[time=2438] And actually what we're doing is we're deceiving them, deceiving ourselves.
[time=2443] And when the truth is found out, we have hindered the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2449] Sincerity is not perfection, sincerity is honesty and integrity that says, I know who I am, I am a human.
[time=2456] I but I possess Jesus Christ and a fragile broken clay pot.
[time=2462] You know, the watching world respects that testimony,
[time=2468] that testimony that is humble and recognizes and admits its weaknesses and its deficiencies.
[time=2477] And in a world that is full of facades and charades and hypocrites, the rest of the world is watching to see if Jesus Christ is real in our life.
[time=2490] And if there is not in our conduct a sincerity, then we will become a stumbling block.
[time=2497] But you know, so many use that for an excuse.
[time=2500] They say, oh, I'm not joining that church.
[time=2503] I know so and so.
[time=2504] And did you know about that person?
[time=2507] They're not gonna join this church or another church because they know someone here and they know something about their life.
[time=2515] So they say, oh, the church is full of hypocrites.
[time=2518] Oh, they say, oh, I knew one born again Christian one time.
[time=2521] Matter of fact, I entered in a business deal with this guy and boy did I get this short end of the deal, no thanks.
[time=2528] You can keep your Christianity.
[time=2529] They're all a bunch of hypocrites.
[time=2533] Don Kruger's mother shared with him a little poem and he passed it along to me that deals with this in a beautiful way.
[time=2540] I'd like to share it with you this morning.
[time=2542] If you should find the perfect church without one fault or smear, for goodness sakes don't join that church, you'll spoil the atmosphere.
[time=2555] If you should find the perfect church where all anxiety cease, then pass it by lest joining it, you'll mar the masterpiece.
[time=2567] If you should find the perfect church, then don't you even dare to tread upon such holy ground, you'll be a misfit there.
[time=2578] But since no perfect church exists, made of imperfect men, then let's cease looking for that church and love the church wherein.
[time=2590] Of course, it's not a perfect church.
[time=2594] That's simple to discern.
[time=2597] But you and I and all of us could cause the tide to turn.
[time=2602] What folks we are to flee our posts
[time=2608] in that unfruitful search, to find at last where problems loom, God proudly builds his church.
[time=2617] So let's keep working in our church until the resurrection, and then we'll each join that church without any imperfection.
[time=2627] You know, this body of believers that's gathered here today has imperfections?
[time=2632] There are people here with weaknesses.
[time=2634] You know how I know that?
[time=2636] I'm a member and I have weaknesses.
[time=2639] We're not here today because we have arrived at a spiritual level that we are spiritual.
[time=2647] We're here today because we're not spiritual because our lives are like porcelain pots with cracks and debt rims and broken off handles.
[time=2659] But Jesus Christ has forgiven us.
[time=2661] We are hypocrites.
[time=2663] None of us is able to live the life that God has called us to.
[time=2668] But yet sincerity says that I am what I am by the grace of God He has forgiven me.
[time=2673] And sincerity is not perfection.
[time=2676] So it's important before a watching world that those of us who profess the name of Jesus Christ that we are sincere, that we practice what we preach, but that we don't cover up who we are with the wax of superficial spirituality.
[time=2692] And today, if you're an onlooker, you're sitting here and saying, "Oh, I came to this church." But as I looked across the aisle this morning, I saw good old so-and-so.
[time=2702] Do you mean to tell me he's a Christian?
[time=2706] No thanks.
[time=2707] My friends, don't excuse your responsibility to Jesus Christ because I'm not what I had to be or so-and-so is not what they ought to be.
[time=2718] Examine the word of God and discover that He loves you in spite of who you are.
[time=2723] He loves me in spite of who I am.
[time=2725] And sincerity is not that we're perfect or that we are what we ought to be, but that we're forgiven.
[time=2732] And sincerity represents our lives, cracks and all.
[time=2735] Then Paul prayed not only for sincerity, but that we might be blameless, that our conduct might be such that there is not an occasion for which we could be blamed, but that people examine our lives and the testimony rings clear for who we are.
[time=2754] What a thrill it was for me this week, on Thursday afternoon to receive a call from a businessman in our church.
[time=2761] He said, "A friend has called and wanted to talk to me," and we were talking about Jesus Christ.
[time=2766] He had some questions.
[time=2767] Could He come down and talk with you?
[time=2769] And as I talked with this individual, I said, "Tim, how is it that you and Gary became acquainted?" He said, "Well, Gary's an expert in his field of business, "and I'm in that business and I called him." And while we talked, he said, "Gary, your reputation as a businessman "is known throughout the city.
[time=2788] "But I know that you are a happy person "and that you're a Christian.
[time=2793] "How is that possible?" You see, here was a businessman that went through the struggles of daily living in our culture and was able to sow by the conduct of his life represent Christ.
[time=2805] The other individual observed that conduct and wanted to see Jesus Christ.
[time=2810] Blamelessness means that there is not a point of offense in our life.
[time=2816] It really comes from a word that means to spring a trap.
[time=2820] I don't know if you've ever sat, set a mouse trap.
[time=2824] What you do is you've got this little spring and the spring holds tension on a bar and you push that bar over and then you put a little trigger on it that holds the bar.
[time=2834] You put cheese on there but peanut butter works a little better.
[time=2837] But you put some type of bait on that mouse trap and a little mouse comes, nose and a lung and that peanut butter is right there on the trigger.
[time=2845] And when he nudges that peanut butter, it releases the trigger and the trap snaps over on him.
[time=2851] That little trigger is what the word means when it says blameless not to give offense.
[time=2860] That there's not a point in our life where somebody investigates and touches it that it's like a trigger and a trap falls upon them.
[time=2869] That our lives be one of impeccability.
[time=2872] You see, are you talking about Christian perfectionism?
[time=2876] No, I'm not perfect.
[time=2879] I doubt that any of you here today are perfect.
[time=2881] If you're under the delusion that you are men, simply ask your wife.
[time=2885] She can straighten out the matter.
[time=2887] Blameless means that within our heart there's sincerity to be honest and there's a desire to live godly so that if there is a point where someone can put their finger in that trap would spring that we by the grace of God would desire to change our conduct.
[time=2904] You see, the Bible says that we are the light of the earth
[time=2910] and you don't tape the light and hide it and cover it up but you place it in a position that it can shine forth and we as Christians are to shine forth but then when someone comes to examine and it's important that we be sincere and that we be blameless.
[time=2927] The demonstration of our sincerity and our blamelessness is found in verse 11 where it says being filled with the fruit of righteousness.
[time=2941] You might say, well, what is that fruit?
[time=2944] Well, fruit is evidence of life.
[time=2948] If you have an apple tree that doesn't produce fruit, you might be suspicious that the apple tree is dead or dying.
[time=2957] Fruit is the evidence of life, like begets like.
[time=2962] That is a cause and effect relationship.
[time=2968] The cause is Jesus Christ in our hearts.
[time=2972] Having been born again, the effect is our life begins to produce good works.
[time=2980] It is not the opposite.
[time=2982] It is not that we produce good works and therefore we are saved.
[time=2987] That is a misapplication of the principle.
[time=2991] That has the effect being the cause.
[time=2994] You see, when Jesus Christ comes into our life, he begins to work from the inside and bring changes and those changes begin to demonstrate themselves in fruit.
[time=3005] In Romans, chapter one, verse 13, Paul said, I wish that I could come to you.
[time=3010] The labor among you that I might have fruit among you.
[time=3014] What he was speaking of was the fruit of people one to Jesus Christ.
[time=3018] The example of life is that it reproduces.
[time=3022] And so today, if we're a Christian, we are to be bearing fruit.
[time=3026] We are to be the light of the world.
[time=3028] We are to be a reproducing Christian.
[time=3031] There is to come out of our life conduct that influences others to receive Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=3038] Many times, we talk about programs.
[time=3041] But evangelism and explosion, a great program, is not really responsible for people coming to Christ nearly as much as other people are.
[time=3052] Most people come to Christ because they see Him in the life of a loved one.
[time=3056] They see Him in the conduct of a neighbor.
[time=3059] They see Him in the character of their spouse.
[time=3061] And there's influence.
[time=3063] Young man came forward this morning in the first service.
[time=3067] He said, I've come to proclaim Christ and I wanna follow Him in baptism.
[time=3072] I said, Dean, how was it that you came to know Christ?
[time=3074] And he said, my brother has a friend named Dana.
[time=3079] And Dana is his big brother through a program called Big Brothers.
[time=3084] And Dana has shared Christ and I wanna receive Him, and I have, and today I wanna identify with Him in baptism.
[time=3092] That's how people become Christians.
[time=3094] That's how we produce fruit when our lives represent Him.
[time=3098] We bear fruit.
[time=3100] But fruit is not only the winning of the lost, but it represents the conduct of our life.
[time=3106] Galatians 5, 22 lists for us the fruit of the spirit.
[time=3112] Love, joy, peace, patience, long suffering, faith, meekness, self-control.
[time=3122] The conduct of our life is demonstration.
[time=3125] It is fruit that Jesus Christ is alive in our heart.
[time=3129] Jesus taught this principle Himself in John chapter 15
[time=3135] where He said, I am the vine.
[time=3137] You are the branches.
[time=3140] If you do not produce fruit, I cut you off and burn you as that which is dead.
[time=3146] But if you're alive, you produce fruit, and that fruit blossoms to the glory of God.
[time=3153] It's a good way of judging today whether you truly know Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3159] If you truly know Christ personally, then it will become evident by the fruit of your life, by the character and the conduct that you keep.
[time=3171] Your life will strangely move from representing the fruit of the flesh, selfishness, strife, enmity, and will strangely begin to represent the fruit of the spirit, love, joy, and peace.
[time=3185] The character of our lives and our conduct changes when Jesus Christ moves in.
[time=3190] Fruit is a result of Christ moving into our heart.
[time=3195] So Paul prayed that these men and women would have a sincerity and a blameless character, and that others would see who they are, and by the fruit of their life, it would come to the praise and glory of God.
[time=3211] The best way to glorify God today is not just in the singing of hymns or in the lip service that we give, but it's by the character and the conduct of the way we live.
[time=3223] That's how we praise God.
[time=3225] That's how we make him known.
[time=3226] That's how we demonstrate that he is alive today.
[time=3230] In the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell took over the throne of England.
[time=3236] Once he became the king of England, an artist came and wished to paint a picture of the great general.
[time=3244] Oliver Cromwell allowed the picture to be done.
[time=3247] He was a very unattractive individual.
[time=3250] There were scars on his face, and there were some unattractive warts that covered his face.
[time=3257] And the artist sat down to the easel and began to paint a picture of the great general.
[time=3261] And when it was finished, Cromwell came and he looked at the picture, it was beautiful.
[time=3266] It was majestic because the artist took the liberty to remove the warts and the scars and put a rather attractive, handsome face that resembled Oliver Cromwell.
[time=3281] Oliver Cromwell turned to the artist and said this, "Paint it again, warts and all." You know, for sincere today as Christians, we will allow our lives to be represented for who we are.
[time=3297] Warts and all, sincerity, lacking in hypocrisy, blameless, eradicating from our life any point where Satan could allow someone else to be trapped and to be dissuaded from following Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[time=3318] What is the purpose of our conduct?
[time=3321] It's that we might glorify Jesus Christ, that we might please him.
[time=3326] And it from the way we live, others would see that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=3333] But it's important to note that while we've talked today primarily to Christians about their conduct, that that conduct is not that which produces salvation.
[time=3344] It is the outgrowth of salvation.
[time=3347] That salvation comes today when we put our trust in Jesus Christ alone and we're trusting in him as our Lord and Savior.
[time=3357] Many of you are familiar with a great verse in the Bible, Ephesians chapter two, verse eight and nine.
[time=3364] It says, "By grace are you saved through faith." It is the gift of God and not of works, lest any man should boast.
[time=3374] That is salvation by faith.
[time=3376] But we are receiving Christ by faith and God's plan is not finished.
[time=3381] For Ephesians two, 10 says this.
[time=3384] For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works.
[time=3391] You see, God's plan is that we had come to Christ first and then having come to Christ, our life would give evidence of that by producing fruit, the fruit of good works.
[time=3402] Do you know Jesus Christ today personally?
[time=3406] Have you received him into your heart as Lord and Savior?
[time=3409] Is your conduct and your character representing that you know him?
[time=3414] I pray that you have.
[time=3416] Let's pray together.
[time=3417] This morning we have spoken to Christians, but if you don't know Christ as your personal Savior, you can invite him into your heart and receive him as Lord and Savior.
[time=3430] We've spoken about conduct that comes out of the life of a Christian.
[time=3435] That conduct is brought about by the Spirit of God and the Word of God that as we know him, we know his plan for our life.
[time=3444] But the most central question we could ask this morning is, do you know Jesus Christ as your Savior?
[time=3450] Are you born again?
[time=3452] If you haven't received him, receive him at this hour.
[time=3456] Our Father, it's our prayer.
[time=3459] You've been sharing the Bible hour.

[time=3549] We might receive you in this Savior.
[time=3551] Others of you may want to become a part of this church.
[time=3554] We invite you to come, present yourself a membership.
[time=3557] In the last hour, there were those that wanted to identify with Christ in baptism, three young men, that drilled my heart when men take a string that you described.
[time=3567] Perhaps there will be those today who want to make a commitment to Christ.
[time=3572] You can please admit your life.
[time=3574] Perhaps you'd want to be that part of the invite you to come today.
[time=3577] But most importantly,
