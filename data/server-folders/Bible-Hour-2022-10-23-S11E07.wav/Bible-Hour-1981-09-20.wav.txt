[time=17] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=24] [MUSIC]
[time=54] Thank you for that good singing and you may be seated.
[time=62] Good morning and we welcome you to our morning worship service
[time=69] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and want to say a special hello and word of welcome to our friends who are joining us by way of television.
[time=77] This morning we have as our special guest Mr. Don Wertzen, a very accomplished musician as a writer and an instrumentalist and today as we sing praises to our God we'll be featuring the music of Mr. Wertzen.
[time=92] All the songs that we'll be hearing the choir and the special musicians sing today will be songs that he either wrote or arranged.
[time=100] And now Mr. Don Kruger is going to lead our choir as they sing "Worthy Is the Lamb" accompanied by Mr. Don Wertzen.
[time=108] [MUSIC]
[time=125] [ Singing "Worthy Is the Lamb" ]
[time=306] It always thrills our hearts to focus our attention on the person of Jesus Christ and to know that he alone is worthy of our praise.
[time=315] As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Don Wertzen is a guest in our facilities today playing the piano for us, sharing something of a personal testimony.
[time=324] Welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=326] It's great to be back again.
[time=328] I know you were here four years ago, the very first patriotic panorama my wife and I attended.
[time=333] And we knew the name Wertzen, but we didn't know who.
[time=336] There are several Wertzen and Christian Wert, and you're related to some of them.
[time=339] Well, I'm the scribbler. I'm the composer.
[time=342] My dad Jack Wertzen is an evangelist, and my sister-in-law Christine is the recording artist.
[time=348] You may have heard her sing on Christian radio.
[time=351] We've not only heard Christine sing on Christian radio, but she's been here two or three times.
[time=356] And Word of Life is an excellent camp that we've sent our young people to in the past.
[time=361] With all that background in Christian service, how did you become a writer and a ranger of Christian music?
[time=366] Well, I was hearing music from the time I was a little taught.
[time=371] My dad was on radio and television in those days, and I was surrounded by some of the finest Christian musicians.
[time=379] And immediately I developed a great interest in music, and I'll never forget just kind of tinkering around on an old upright piano
[time=389] and trying to imitate what I'd heard on records.
[time=392] My older sister had the audacity to suggest that I needed piano lessons.
[time=396] My first piano lesson I was presented with a bright red shiny rectangular shaped book called "Teaching Little Fingers to Play"
[time=403] with some great masterpieces in it, like here we go up a road to a birthday party and ending with a wigwomb.
[time=411] You're not going to play those for us today. I know that.
[time=414] Well, I was really kind of hoping I could.
[time=417] I know that being an encouragement to people like me with no musical ability, but you've written many, many songs.
[time=424] You're going to play some of them for us today. What are some of the ones our people might be most familiar with?
[time=428] The first song of mine that became pretty well known was yesterday, today and tomorrow, and then "Where the Is the Lamb".
[time=436] "Love with When", "Unbanded Grace", "Finally Home", a lot of people have been comforted by the chorus of "Finally Home",
[time=444] but just think of stepping on shore and finding it heaven, touching a hand and finding it gods,
[time=450] of breathing new air and finding it celestial, of waking up in glory and finding it home.
[time=456] Those are a few of the better known ones.
[time=458] You know, Don, I think every one of those songs that you've just mentioned are regulars here.
[time=463] "Love was When" was part of a living Christmas tree cantata that we've done.
[time=468] All of our hearts thrilled to finally home. I've got to make a word of explanation.
[time=473] This morning, on another broadcast, on Day of Discovery, Don Wertzen was also interviewed, and you wore this exact same suit.
[time=481] So people are wondering how I got all the way from Florida up here so quick, right?
[time=486] Right, and one of the broadcasts is live, and one of them is pre-recorded, we won't tell you which.
[time=491] But these are two different days, and we're glad you're here sharing with us.
[time=495] One of the things that you might be able to help us with is, what part do you see music playing in the life of a believer or in the life of a church, Don?
[time=502] Well, I really feel like most Christians don't realize the determinative position,
[time=509] the strategic position that music should have in our life.
[time=512] Most of us just take it for granted, and yet when you search the Scripture, the Old Testament is full of references to worship and praise.
[time=521] And the New Testament says that when we're filled with the Word of God, Colossians 3, we come under the control of the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 5, and of the things that result that Paul talks about, the first two he mentions are making music.
[time=537] You have to do with making music, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, making melody, singing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[time=545] And it also occurs to me that music is very important because when this old earth goes up in smoke in the end time,
[time=554] we're going to have music and eternity.
[time=557] And we'll be singing the praises of the Lamb in heaven and glory for all of eternity, forever and ever.
[time=564] I think that makes it extremely important in the life of the Christian.
[time=568] I wouldn't be surprised if when we get to heaven, as the book of Revelation says, we'll be singing "Worthy is the Lamb." I won't be surprised if it's not your arrangement once we get there.
[time=577] Well, I've often wondered if we'd sing "Gathers or Handles or Mine." I don't know.
[time=583] I'll vote for yours. Thank you for sharing with us today, Don.
[time=587] Don's moving his way to the piano now that he can play a piano solo for us.
[time=592] The title of that song is "Love was When." We're so thankful to have you with us today and to have your musical ability shared in a way that lifts our hearts to praise God.
[time=603] Thank you, Don.
[time=630] [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=763] Hello. Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=772] With me is my friend Don Kruger.
[time=774] Good morning, Don.
[time=775] Good morning, Pastor Rick.
[time=776] My name is Rick Hawks.
[time=778] We have a special musician with us today, Mr. Don Wertzen, who you've already had the opportunity to see.
[time=785] Thank you for joining us.
[time=787] I hope that during these days you'll be receiving a letter from me.
[time=791] Many of you probably received it in the mail during the last few days or perhaps you'll be getting it in the days ahead.
[time=798] In that letter, I sent you a prayer reminder of some of the needs of the Bible Hour.
[time=803] We listed the needs of various staff people, such as myself, Don Kruger and Dale Sigland.
[time=811] Also, we mentioned our financial needs, the need we have to pay for the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=818] And as you read through those prayer lists, we pray that you'll be thinking of us daily,
[time=824] and that little card will be a reminder to you to think of us and that you'll pray for us often.
[time=830] Then, when you receive the letter, please take the time to read it so that as you read the letter, you can be well informed of the needs of the Bible Hour.
[time=840] Your friendship is so important to us at this time, so please take the time to read the letter,
[time=846] all the information, and be praying for us.
[time=849] We have some financial needs at this time and trust that this letter will outline those needs for you and that you'll take this as an opportunity to send a special gift to help support the Bible Hour.
[time=860] Many of you have already told us that you are behind the Bible Hour with your prayers
[time=866] and also with your finances, and we appreciate that.
[time=869] We want to encourage you to continue to do that.
[time=871] That is an encouragement to us and a help, and you can be a real help to us if you continue to do that.
[time=877] Last week, you had an opportunity to meet one of our friends, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=883] Ken is on our staff here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and he works in a lot of different areas, but the main ministry he has is the Ministry of Counseling.
[time=892] He is the Director of the Live Counseling Center and is a licensed psychologist by the State of Indiana.
[time=899] He got his doctorate degree in Psychology at a Christian institution, Rosemeade Graduate School of Psychology, and he's prepared a little booklet which we'd like to share with you.
[time=910] And Don has that booklet with him this morning.
[time=913] Pastor Rick, the booklet is called Remedy for Negative Thinking.
[time=916] It's a tremendous little booklet and has lots of good ideas for those who are immersed in thinking negatively.
[time=925] The Word of God has so many principles that tell us that we should be thinking high thoughts and good thoughts, positive thoughts.
[time=931] And this is a helpful booklet for those who are not able to do that.
[time=935] How negative thinking starts, leaving God out of our thinking.
[time=939] God gives us the right to choose conflict in the mind.
[time=944] Dr. Ken meets many people who come to him, and they are just engulfed with negative thinking.
[time=950] And his whole burden has been the idea of reaching these people before they get so depressed that they need his counsel.
[time=959] And this little booklet is a help on the back of the book.
[time=963] In the back page, there are some extra scripture verses that are a help.
[time=967] Many of you know these scripture verses are just a reminder.
[time=970] Romans 1, 21, and 24. Romans 8, 6, and 7.
[time=974] It's a good little booklet and we'd like you folks to be able to have this booklet.
[time=978] If you're interested, please send to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=988] Send and ask for the booklet by Dr. Ken Nichols, Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=994] And we hope you'll just sit right down today and write an ask for that book.
[time=998] Thank you, Don, for sharing that information.
[time=1001] I know Dr. Ken has a burden for what he calls preventative counseling.
[time=1005] Help for each of our personal, spiritual, and emotional lives before we reach the point of crisis.
[time=1012] This little booklet, Remedies for Negative Thinking, is a great resource in preventative counseling.
[time=1018] Write to us today. Write the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1027] Be thinking of us this week. Pray for us.
[time=1030] And if God enables you, won't you help with the financial needs of the Bible Hour.
[time=1035] Thank you.
[time=1042] [SILENCE]
[time=1052] [MUSIC]
[time=1067] [ Singing ]
[time=1283] Thank you, ladies, for that beautiful singing and that heart that would turn our attention to the fact that God's grace is infinite.
[time=1290] It is not bound that there isn't a reservoir of love in God that can never be taken away.
[time=1297] Don Wurtsen wrote that song and he also wrote the next song that we're going to hear sung.
[time=1302] This next song is not nearly as popular or as well known because it takes a very talented voice to do that.
[time=1310] It takes some voice that has a powerful, majestic tone and some ability to sing a rather high baritone.
[time=1316] And we have just the young man with Mr. Keith Brodigan.
[time=1320] Now, if you were here a couple weeks on Sunday night, you heard some news that you may have missed.
[time=1325] If you're just a Sunday morning attender or part of our Bible Hour family, that news is that Mr. Keith Brodigan is engaged to be married to Ms. Starr Narwald here on the 21st of November at 4 o'clock.
[time=1339] I'm going to come. I've got a reserve seat.
[time=1343] That wedding is open to the church family and we're looking forward to that day.
[time=1368] We love Keith and Starr and the ministry they have in the Lord.
[time=1372] And as soon as he regains his composure, Keith is going to sing for us this morning.
[time=1377] And the song that he'll be singing again was written by Mr. Wurtsen.
[time=1380] It's entitled The Day That I Met Jesus.
[time=1393] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=1551] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1563] Well, that's just tremendous, that great reminder that Jesus lives, and that He lives within our hearts.
[time=1571] If today you leave not remembering any other fact, would you today learn that truth, that Jesus Christ is alive, and that He lives not just in heaven, but He lives within the hearts of those who had put their faith and their trust in Him?
[time=1587] Let's pray together.
[time=1589] Our Father, we pray that in these next moments as we open your word, as we study the pages of Scripture that the Spirit of God would take the message that you wrote and penetrate our hearts, piercing us, dividing our hearts asunder, separating us, knowing the thoughts and intents, that we might see Jesus Christ, that He might see us.
[time=1611] For it's in His name we pray, amen.
[time=1615] Joseph was one of those unique young men who had the ability to flaunt all that he possessed to the agony of his brothers.
[time=1626] His Father gave him a coat of many colors, and this coat represented the straw that broke the camel's back.
[time=1635] For years his brothers had labored under the fact that he was the apple of his Father's eye, and that Joseph was the recipient of his Father's favoritism.
[time=1644] His brothers were enraged at this final act of jealousy when Joseph paraded the beautiful coat in front of them, and their anger grew so great they determined that they were going to kill him.
[time=1657] But one of the brothers was a bit more economically minded than vengeful, and he decided that they'd be far smarter to tell their Father that Joseph was killed, but sell Joseph into slavery and pocket the prophets.
[time=1671] So the plot was implemented.
[time=1673] An animal was killed, and Joseph's beautiful coat was taken and drenched through mud, mutilated, and returned to the Father with the explanation that a wild animal had killed the younger brother.
[time=1686] In the meantime, Joseph was sold into slavery.
[time=1689] In to Egypt he found his way and ultimately became a prisoner in a jail.
[time=1697] But through the workings of God, God gave a dream to Pharaoh, and he gave to Joseph the ability to interpret that dream.
[time=1704] And so Joseph came out of prison and rose up to great prominence as the prince in Egypt.
[time=1711] As the hand of God would have it, a great famine hit Israel.
[time=1716] And Joseph's brothers had to work their way south out of Israel to Egypt.
[time=1722] And there they came and stood before the prince of Egypt asking to buy grain,
[time=1728] not knowing that the prince before whom they stood was their brother Joseph.
[time=1734] In a moment of revelation, when Joseph told them that he was their brother, the brother they sold into slavery, their hearts failed them for fear.
[time=1747] And they were greatly afraid that Joseph was going to strike out with great vengeance,
[time=1753] but Joseph's words were these.
[time=1756] What you did to me, you intended for evil, but God intended it for good.
[time=1764] What you did to me, you planned it to be evil, but God had a plan, and he planned it for good.
[time=1771] And we learned in the pages of the Old Testament in the life of Joseph that God is in control.
[time=1778] I remember leading a Bible study of the camp, and the passage was entitled, "Don't Get Shook, God's In Control." Apostle Paul wrote a letter entitled Philippians with that same message, "Don't Get Shook, God's In Control." Many times Paul wrote to the Church of Rome saying, "Oh, I'd love to come to present Jesus Christ to you that I might have fruit among you."
[time=1805] In Acts he said, "I'm setting my course to Jerusalem, and from there I must go to Rome."
[time=1811] Paul made it to Rome, but surprising, he made it as a prisoner.
[time=1817] And in Romans he tells of his desire, in Philippians he writes of the fulfillment.
[time=1824] And so in Romans we hear the great heartbeat to go.
[time=1829] In Philippians we discover the fulfillment.
[time=1832] Philippians chapter 1 verse 12.
[time=1836] "But I would, you should understand, brethren, that the things that have happened unto me
[time=1843] have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,
[time=1849] so that in my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places.
[time=1856] And many of the brethren in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds,
[time=1862] are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
[time=1867] Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some of good will.
[time=1876] The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely supposing to add to my affliction in my bonds,
[time=1884] but the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.
[time=1892] What then? Not withstanding.
[time=1896] In every way, whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached.
[time=1903] And in that I do rejoice. Yay, I will rejoice."
[time=1911] The apostle Paul spoke of a great desire to go to Rome, not knowing that God's passport was through chains and imprisonment.
[time=1921] His great desire to go.
[time=1924] But as he wrote from those situations and under those circumstances, he wrote this phrase, "The things that have happened unto me have happened unto the furtherance of the gospel." What he was saying was this, "It's been years since I was in Philippi, no doubt you've heard rumor of what's happened to me.
[time=1943] People of Philippi may have not known, whether Paul lived or whether he's put to death."
[time=1949] Paul said, "I want you to know that the things that have happened unto me were part of God's plan." Now, what were those things?
[time=1958] Well, after Paul left Philippi, he came south back towards Jerusalem.
[time=1962] And he was met by a prophet by the name of Agabus.
[time=1966] And Agabus warned Paul that if he was to go to Jerusalem, his life would be in danger.
[time=1972] Being of a determined heart and a committed spirit, Paul went.
[time=1976] Upon arriving there, he was apprehended by a mob and nearly lynched, except for the intervention of the Romans.
[time=1984] They placed him in the prison.
[time=1987] And for over two years, Paul suffered the humiliation of imprisonment
[time=1993] upon trial, upon retrial, upon mocking.
[time=1996] Many times, Paul was brought to repeat his same defense time and time again.
[time=2002] One time, there was a known plot that Paul was going to be transported from one location to another.
[time=2008] And a certain group of people developed an assassination plot.
[time=2012] And Paul was spared at the last moment, again by the intervention of the Romans.
[time=2018] Years went by that Paul was held in prison.
[time=2022] He could have been set free, except for it was more politically expedient for some of the rulers to hold him captive to please the multitude.
[time=2030] There was a time where Paul was given the opportunity to be set free if he would simply pass under the table a bribe.
[time=2038] But his character would not allow him to do that.
[time=2041] Finally, he leaves Jerusalem, having pled his right as a Roman citizen to appeal to Caesar.
[time=2048] On the voyage sailing from Israel to Rome, they encounter a great storm, so great a storm that they fear they're going to lose their life.
[time=2057] The Romans who are guarding the prisoners determined that their prisoners might escape and they should be put to death.
[time=2065] Paul's life is nearly taken again.
[time=2068] Instead, they revise the plan and allow them all to try to swim the shore.
[time=2073] Upon arriving on the shore, they come to an island, and there on that island they collect wood to build a fire.
[time=2080] And out of that wood crawls a deadly poisonous serpent that bites Paul.
[time=2086] Finally, they return on their voyage to Rome, where Paul has held as a prisoner in bonds.
[time=2094] Paul said these things that have happened under me have happened unto the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2101] You know, there's a tremendous lesson there.
[time=2103] The lesson that Joseph knew that God was in control, even when his brother sold him into slavery, even when he sat in a prison, Joseph knew that God was in control.
[time=2115] Paul now writes that same expression and says that God is in control.
[time=2123] The things that have happened unto me are not the ill-fated attempts of Jews and Romans to take my life.
[time=2129] They're part of the very plan of God to bring me to Rome.
[time=2133] There's a tremendous lesson of warning here.
[time=2137] A great calling does not necessitate great comfort.
[time=2141] You see, Paul had a great calling.
[time=2144] He was back in Acts chapter 9.
[time=2146] God called Paul, and he said, "Paul, you're going to proclaim my name before Gentiles and before kings." Now, you might think, "Wow, God commissioned me as a special preacher that proclaimed the gospel before kings.
[time=2159] My, the dignity that's going to come to my life." Oh, no.
[time=2165] Great calling does not necessitate great comfort.
[time=2168] Paul proclaimed the gospel before Gentiles.
[time=2171] And Paul proclaimed it before kings was not in great comfort.
[time=2176] You see, when Paul proclaimed the gospel before our king, Herod Agrippa, he proclaimed it as a prisoner.
[time=2184] Now Paul's in Rome, and he has opportunity to proclaim the gospel in Rome before Caesar.
[time=2191] But he comes, not with the robes of dignity and the air of majesty.
[time=2196] There's no pomp and circumstance as being played upon his arrival.
[time=2200] There's no official greeting at the airport where there's a shaking of hands between two political dignitaries.
[time=2206] Paul comes with chains about him, and he comes as a prisoner.
[time=2212] God calls us to a great calling.
[time=2215] But that does not necessitate a great comfort.
[time=2218] Well, Paul said these things happened under the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2223] That little word "furtherance" is actually a military term.
[time=2227] It refers to an advance, a pioneer advance.
[time=2231] It's like a military tactical strategic force that goes out and attacks
[time=2237] ahead of the main body to establish a beachhead, to make an in-road, to pioneer into the jungle to make room for the major assault.
[time=2247] And Paul said, "God is using these circumstances in my life to make a beachhead, a foothold in Rome for the gospel of Jesus Christ." And you know something that worked.
[time=2257] In Philippians 4, if you'll turn back just a few pages to chapter 4, verse 22,
[time=2263] Paul said this, "Greet every saint in Jesus Christ,
[time=2269] the brethren who are with me greet you.
[time=2272] All the saints greet you chiefly they that are of Caesar's household." You see, Paul was being held as a political prisoner.
[time=2281] And being held as a political prisoner, he had opportunity to share his faith with those who trafficked in the very palace of Caesar and they came to Christ.
[time=2292] And you see, God so used Paul that he turned his prison into a pulpit.
[time=2299] And Paul said these things have happened that the gospel might be further.
[time=2304] There are several ways within this passage and within the pages of the New Testament that we see that the gospel is further.
[time=2312] First, by Paul's actual witness, verse 13, so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places.
[time=2322] Luke tells us in Acts of the type of handcuffs that were used upon the apostle Paul.
[time=2328] It was a relatively short chain, several inches, maybe only a foot, and there was a shackle on each end.
[time=2334] And one of those shackles would be placed about Paul's arm and then connected by that short chain, another shackle would be placed about the arm of a Roman soldier.
[time=2346] Now these Roman soldiers were called the Praetorian Guard.
[time=2351] Augustus Caesar, known as Octavian, selected out 1,000 of the best military men.
[time=2359] They received double pay and special privileges.
[time=2363] These men were called the Praetorian Guard and their chief residence was in Rome to guard Caesar's palace.
[time=2371] It was to these men that the apostle Paul was chained night and day, 24 hours.
[time=2378] Four shifts a day, each man working six hour shifts, they were chained to the apostle Paul.
[time=2385] Now if you've ever studied much of the life of the apostle Paul, you can imagine what happened to those soldiers.
[time=2391] They came on duty, they were chained to Paul, and Paul would look him right in the eye and said, "Could I ask you a couple questions?" Suppose you were to die tonight.
[time=2400] Do you know for certain that you'd go to heaven?
[time=2403] If you were to die tonight, do you know for certain what you would say?
[time=2406] If God was to say to you, why should I let you into my kingdom?
[time=2410] Now we chuckled this morning because those are two questions we often use in evangelism to determine whether a person knows Jesus Christ personally.
[time=2420] I doubt that Paul used those exact same questions, but I know for fact that the content of the gospel was shared in a mighty way.
[time=2428] In such a powerful way that Paul could write to the Philippians and say, "The saints, the believers who are in Caesar's household, they greet you." How did they become Christians?
[time=2439] They came Christians because the man to whom they were chained shared with them, Jesus Christ.
[time=2445] As a matter of fact, the witness was so effective that they came to Christ and they told others, and the Romans were in fear when they learned that there were Christians in high places of government within the workings of Rome.
[time=2459] They were so concerned that they sent spies into the meeting of Christians, and they spies came back with this report.
[time=2467] They said they strangely worship in a place where there are no idols, there are no statues, there are no pictures.
[time=2474] They continually speak of this one named Jesus who was strangely absent, although they seem to believe that he's going to arrive at any time, and all how they love him and love each other.
[time=2489] Now how did that come about?
[time=2491] It came about because God sent an ambassador in chains to Rome, and Paul wrote 2 Timothy from Rome, and he wrote to his young friend, Timothy, and he said, "Timothy, I am here, treated as an evil doer.
[time=2505] I am in bonds, but the Word of God is not bound." And God used the witness of a prisoner to share the life-changing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=2518] The Roman imprisonment was God's plan of getting the gospel to Rome.
[time=2524] The chain that bound Paul was the very avenue that God was using to be his instrument
[time=2531] to share Jesus Christ, to a group of people who would otherwise not have that opportunity.
[time=2538] There may be some chains that bind your life today.
[time=2541] Oh, you probably aren't handcuffed to someone, but you may perhaps feel that there are some chains that bind you.
[time=2549] You may feel that you have some physical limitations.
[time=2552] You have some things about your body.
[time=2554] You have some arthritis that strikes your knees.
[time=2556] You have diabetes that infects your whole system.
[time=2560] You may be agonizing under cancer, and you say, "Oh, the chain that binds my life."
[time=2566] You may be sitting in a point of great emotional frustration.
[time=2570] You may feel that there are some chains within your family that binds you.
[time=2574] You've got children that just drive you up the wall and a husband that's worse.
[time=2580] Can you take a little word of comfort from Susan Wesley?
[time=2584] Susanna Wesley lived in the 1700s.
[time=2588] She had 19 children.
[time=2590] Now, if that's not enough to send chills up every woman's spine, think of this.
[time=2595] There were no washing machines.
[time=2598] There were no dryers.
[time=2600] There were no disposable diapers.
[time=2602] There was no Lysol.
[time=2604] 19 children in the 1700s.
[time=2608] No doubt in the life of Susanna Wesley.
[time=2611] There were times when she said, "I can't take these kids." Now, if you know anything about evolution, you know the evolution of children.
[time=2619] They start off very small as a rug rat, crawling across the carpet,
[time=2625] and they evolve up one level to that which we call, jokingly, a crumb crusher,
[time=2631] that as they crawl, they leave a consistent trail of crushed up cookies and crackers and sticky little things all in the carpet.
[time=2639] Then the next stage of growth is they become a curtain climber, and those sticky little fingers grab on the curtain in the upholstery and pull their way up and in the same time pull the curtains down.
[time=2652] It's not long before you have in your house a full-fledged yard ape running to and fro, leaving a path of total destruction.
[time=2660] Susan Wesley had 19 of those little bundles of joy in the 1700s.
[time=2667] And I'm sure there were times when she felt that she was bound to a kitchen, feeding 19 mouths.
[time=2674] I'm sure that as she washed diapers, she thought the trail would never end and it probably didn't.
[time=2680] But you know, there was something about those chains that were mighty in the hand of God.
[time=2685] For two of her sons played a tremendous influence in your life and in mine.
[time=2691] One of her sons name was Charles.
[time=2693] And Charles Wesley became a great hymn writer.
[time=2696] Perhaps you've sung "Heart the Herald" Angel sing "Glory to the Newborn King."
[time=2702] Charles Wesley wrote that song.
[time=2705] Perhaps you've sung "Jesus, lover of my soul." It was Charles Wesley who wrote that one.
[time=2713] Perhaps you've been caught up in the spirit and you've sensed the power of music when you've sang that "great hymn" and "can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood."
[time=2727] He for me who caused his pain.
[time=2730] Charles Wesley wrote that "great hymn, amazing love, and can it be."
[time=2738] He was raised in the godly home by a mother who saw the value of being a housewife
[time=2744] and of caring for children as an opportunity to build character in the word of God in the lives of her children.
[time=2751] Charles had a brother, his name, John Wesley.
[time=2755] John Wesley grew up with the discipline of knowing the word of God and he set his heart to be a missionary from England to a strange land called Georgia in the United States.
[time=2769] Wesley came and was greatly frustrated because he just didn't have the confidence of the word of God
[time=2776] and so he sailed back to England, defeated, and dejected.
[time=2780] Wesley got aboard a ship and that ship was also inhabited by some pietist.
[time=2785] A great storm hit that ship and Wesley feared for his life and wondered of his own soul.
[time=2792] But those pietists sat on the deck of the ship and sang praises to God.
[time=2797] The agony in the hall of that ship, Wesley cried out, "I came to convert the heathen, but who shall convert me?"
[time=2804] The ship made its way back to England. Wesley went to Aldersgate and there he got on his knees and he discovered that Jesus Christ was alive and he made his commitment to Christ.
[time=2815] John Wesley got on a horse and thought he had a lazy Sunday if he didn't preach at least five times.
[time=2821] So successful was the preaching of John Wesley that they called it the method.
[time=2826] And today we are blessed in this country by a history of great evangelists who were sent out by the Methodist founded by John Wesley.
[time=2836] Much of the evangelistic fervor that came through the first and second great awakening
[time=2842] in the history of this country came through the Methodist who preached the gospel Jesus Christ
[time=2848] because of their founder John Wesley, whose mother taught him the word of God and saw that home as an opportunity to train young men to be dedicated to Jesus Christ.
[time=2860] Perhaps you've got a different chain.
[time=2863] Your chain is your husband.
[time=2865] A rather inconsiderate barbarian direct descendant of Attila de Han.
[time=2870] And this would be lover of your soul was so kind that he left you the car to use one day
[time=2877] and put the keys in his own pocket and went off to work.
[time=2882] Jill Briscoe, famous writer of biblical books, wife of Stuart Briscoe, a great preacher,
[time=2889] tells about a time that her husband did that very thing to her.
[time=2892] Left through the car that she could go out and speak to a group of ladies, went off to work and put both sets of keys in his pocket.
[time=2901] She frantically tried to call and couldn't find keys anywhere.
[time=2906] She was running late and she finally discovered an extra set of keys.
[time=2911] She went out, got in the car, running late, drove past a group of gals hitchhiking and said, "Well, I'm already late. What's a few more minutes?" Stopped and picked up these young ladies.
[time=2922] She persuaded the young girls that they might want to come to the meeting where she was speaking.
[time=2927] So begrudgingly, they agreed to come, went to the meeting and sat through it.
[time=2932] One of those gals who she picked up hitchhiking accepted Jesus Christ and told Jill Briscoe this story.
[time=2940] I was a student in training to go into missionary work.
[time=2944] And I was so discouraged and so unable to understand the Word of God in the scriptures,
[time=2951] I didn't really even know that God was real.
[time=2954] And I said, "God, I want 30 days, and if in 30 days you don't convince me that you're real,
[time=2962] then I'm going to leave the missionary service and I'm going to leave life.
[time=2967] God, you've got 30 days." Jill Briscoe picked her up because she was running late.
[time=2974] Took her to a meeting, she heard the gospel and she accepted Christ and said to Jill Briscoe, "Today is the 30th day." Now, how did that happen?
[time=2984] It happened because a husband was either absent minded or a little bit inconsiderate,
[time=2991] but it also happened because there was a sovereign God that had sent two girls hitchhiking and wanted somebody to wait and time to pick them up that she could hear about Jesus Christ.
[time=3001] I don't know the chains that might bind your life.
[time=3006] The hurts and the frustrations, the agony of physical ailments, but I know that God is in control and that He has said that all things work together for good
[time=3018] to those who love Him and who are the called according to His purpose.
[time=3022] Joseph knew it from the prison of Egypt.
[time=3025] He knew it from slavery.
[time=3027] Paul could write about it from Roman handcuffed to the Praetorian Guard.
[time=3032] You can know it today.
[time=3034] Stories told about a professor at Union Theological Seminary.
[time=3039] The professor continually taught his young men that God was in control and that Roman's A28 was true that all things worked together for good.
[time=3048] He went home one day after class and discovered that his wife had been killed.
[time=3053] The president of that university came to visit him to be of encouragement and the professor sent back a message with the president.
[time=3061] The message was this, tell my students that Romans A28 is still true.
[time=3069] God is in control and He can use all things for good.
[time=3076] I don't know the chain that you might drag today, but I know that that chain might be the very instrument that God is using in your life that He might use you in a way that would be totally impossible to do if it wasn't for the chain.
[time=3091] There's a tremendous song that we've heard sung in our auditorium many times.
[time=3096] It's called "Praise of the Lord." And one of the phrases within that song is "Praise the Lord." For those chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise Him.
[time=3112] And God brings into every life a little bit of difficulty some adversity, some problems, some disappointments, some frustrations
[time=3122] that He might use those chains as a reminder that He is God and that He is in control.
[time=3130] And those chains not only remind us, but many times they become the very launching pad of opportunity that God has for us.
[time=3139] Paul would have not made it to Rome had it not been for the shackles that were about his arms.
[time=3147] Gilbrisco would have never had opportunity to share Jesus Christ with a girl intent on destroying her own life
[time=3154] if her husband hadn't kept the keys to that car.
[time=3159] God is in control.
[time=3161] Paul said the things that have happened under me have happened that the gospel might be furthered and it worked.
[time=3169] We see verse 13 says that Christ is manifest in the palace and in all other places.
[time=3178] There were those who became believers that actually lived in Caesar's palace.
[time=3184] The soldiers that were chained to Him became believers in Jesus Christ.
[time=3190] And they grew in their witness and they told others.
[time=3193] And there's a legend within the pages of the history of the church.
[time=3197] Of 40 soldiers committed to Jesus Christ who were tried by the Roman Empire and they were banished from the Roman Empire
[time=3205] placed out in the snow, stripped naked, placed there to die, guarded by other Roman soldiers, unbelievers.
[time=3213] And those naked men gathered together and they sang praise to Jesus Christ.
[time=3219] And they sang and one of them would die from exposure and another would die until there was just a handful left.
[time=3227] And they sang and their testimony was so real and it was so sharp that when the last one of them died,
[time=3234] some of the Roman soldiers who were there to guard them took off their clothes and walked naked and took their place
[time=3240] and sang the praises of Jesus Christ.
[time=3243] Those Roman soldiers would have never heard except for Paul witness to some other Roman soldiers.
[time=3249] And the Roman soldiers that guarded them would have never heard except where they were sentenced to die and they died singing praises to Jesus Christ.
[time=3257] Our God is in control.
[time=3261] It may hurt.
[time=3264] It may bring agony and disappointment to your life.
[time=3268] It took Paul through two years of trial in Jerusalem.
[time=3272] It took Paul a shipwreck.
[time=3274] It took a snake bite.
[time=3276] It took shackles in Rome.
[time=3278] It took prison money in Rome.
[time=3280] It ultimately cost him his life.
[time=3282] But he could say with confidence the things that have happened under me have happened that the gospel of Jesus Christ might be furthered.
[time=3290] Our God is in control.
[time=3295] Is you sing the praises of your God?
[time=3298] Would you witness to a friend?
[time=3300] There's such a success syndrome that says I've got to look sharp and be successful in order for people to accept me.
[time=3308] You discover something that the greatest witnesses in the Bible were those that witnessed under the greatest difficulty.
[time=3316] That's why we sing just as I am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me because Jesus Christ uses us
[time=3322] and accepts us just the way we are.
[time=3325] Limitations and all.
[time=3328] But would you know today that God is in control of your life and the hurt that you experience, the pain that you suffer,
[time=3335] the disappointment and the husbands that take the keys and the kids that climb the curtains are the very things that God has so determined in your life are his avenue of service for you.
[time=3347] You can trust him today. He is God and he is in control. Let's pray together.
[time=3354] This morning we shared a message that God is in control and that the Bible says that he is in control of everything
[time=3363] and that all things work together for good to those who love God and who are the called according to his purpose.
[time=3372] The Bible says that we can trust him but that trust begins when we receive Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.
[time=3381] You may not know what that means this morning.
[time=3384] You may be sitting in this auditorium or in your home saying I don't understand.
[time=3390] What is he talking about?
[time=3392] Jesus Christ said these words, "Behold, I stand at the door of your heart and knock.
[time=3398] And if any man hears my voice and will open the door, I will come in and I will live in his heart and he with me."
[time=3406] It's a simple act of faith that we invite Jesus Christ into our heart.
[time=3411] You may not understand all of the Bible. You may have questions and concern.
[time=3416] One man came to Jesus and said, "Lord, I believe, but help thou my unbelief."
[time=3422] Today you may not have all the answers but Jesus is the answer to the needs of your heart and you must receive him by faith.
[time=3431] Invite him into your heart and this morning you can pray and say, "Jesus Christ, I need you as my Savior.
[time=3438] I want you to come into my heart. I receive you." Won't you do that this morning? Ask Jesus Christ into your heart today.
[time=3448] Our Father, we pray. You've been sharing the Bible hour.
