[time=30] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=41] [[MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]]
[time=95] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=101] Good morning, we're so thankful that you've come on this Lord's Day to worship with us this morning.
[time=107] We've had a busy week, we've had a work day yesterday with over 100 people coming to work around the facilities of busy week with evangelism and business meetings,
[time=118] but today we've come that we might sing praises to our God and that we might preach God's Word.
[time=124] We're trusting today that the Word of God would be a tremendous encouragement to your life, and we welcome you this morning to our worship service and say a special good morning and welcome to our friends who are joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=137] We're going to hear from our choir now as they sing a beautiful hymn entitled "Shout 4th in Praise."
[time=144] And this particular number was written by Mr. Don Kruger, who is also directing the choir.
[time=150] Shout 4th in Praise.
[time=152] [[MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]]
[time=228] Shout 4th in Praise.
[time=239] Let let all heaven sing.
[time=246] Let all creation join the song, Shout 4th in Praise.
[time=257] Shout 4th in Praise.
[time=268] Jesus sent us.
[time=282] [[MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC] Since I started for the kingdom [MUSIC] Since my life he controls [MUSIC] Since I gave my heart to Jesus [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] The more that I love him or love he bestows [MUSIC] Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] Every need is supplying [MUSIC] Plant your sprays, maybe stone [MUSIC] Every day, my way gets brighter [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] The more that I love him, the more love he bestows [MUSIC] Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows [MUSIC] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows â™ª
[time=1366] Thank you, Dennis, for that reminder that God is faithful, and that when we serve him, the longer we serve him, the sweeter he grows.
[time=1387] I know if that song would have been written thousands of years ago, it would have been in delight for the Apostle Paul to hear,
[time=1395] "The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows." You know what is interesting is you go to the supermarket and you stand in the checkout line and you observe magazines,
[time=1406] and just to read some of the captions of magazines.
[time=1410] One particular magazine had a little subtitle at the bottom.
[time=1414] Scientists discovered the key to long life.
[time=1417] Another magazine promises that within this article there are 100 ways to make your marriage more meaningful.
[time=1424] And as you look at some of the captions, some of the titles, even some of the names of the magazines themselves,
[time=1431] they indicate a real quest to identify that which will fulfill life, that which can give purpose to life.
[time=1439] It's interesting that we from the modern age of technology are always striving to find more ways to give life more pleasure,
[time=1448] to get rid of more pain to extend life. Then I read in an interesting track this week that began with this statement,
[time=1457] "Science in medicine has done much to lengthen our life expectation, but can do absolutely nothing to give to our life, meaning."
[time=1468] I remember reading an article about an interview that a professor at Harvard University conducted with an incoming student.
[time=1475] He said to the student, "Why have you chosen to come to Harvard University?" The student said, "I've come that I could get a degree in law." The professor said, "Why is it that you're interested in getting a law degree?" He said, "That I might open up a law practice." The professor said, "Why would you like to have a practice in law?" The student said, "That I could gain an income and that I could live." The professor says, "And why is it that you want to gain an income?" He said, "That I can provide for my family and that my family and I might live, that I might have life."
[time=1513] The professor said, "And why is it that you want to live?"
[time=1519] That brilliant would-be student had no answer. Why is it that he wanted to live?
[time=1528] The Apostle Paul was not of that same mind.
[time=1532] He knew that his life had purpose and that his purpose was so compelling that he had within that such a driving force behind him,
[time=1541] that that purpose to life would drive him through life and even to the point of death.
[time=1547] And so Paul writes of that purpose in Philippians the first chapter.
[time=1551] And so this morning I would read for you Philippians chapter 1 verses 19 through 21.
[time=1558] Paul writes from a prison. He writes with a chain about one arm extended to the arm of a Roman guard.
[time=1566] But he writes of confidence and he writes of victory.
[time=1569] 1st chapter of Philippians verse 19, "For I know this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[time=1583] According to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed.
[time=1592] But that with all boldness as always, so now Christ also shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by my life or by my death.
[time=1605] For me to live his Christ and to die is gain."
[time=1611] The apostle Paul would write of the purpose of his life that he might magnify Christ, that he might magnify Christ in his body, and that he might magnify Christ in his body, whether it was by his life or by his death.
[time=1627] It's interesting to note though the little word expectation.
[time=1632] That little word is a composite of three parts of other words. It means to turn the head from.
[time=1640] What the apostle Paul was saying there was something in his life that gained his attention and turned his head away from everything else to that one central purpose.
[time=1649] Something that was such a driving goal in his life that it captivated his every thought.
[time=1655] I love to watch commercials and recently there's a commercial and it shows a tennis match and one guy hits it and it goes across and back and forth.
[time=1664] And the crowd is in eagerness with anticipation watching the volley back and forth.
[time=1670] And then the camera goes behind and focuses in on one particular individual as the head goes back and forth.
[time=1676] And she says, "My broker is E.F. Hutton." And suddenly every head turns and focuses in.
[time=1682] And everyone on the court, even the officials leaning back to hear what E.F. Hutton has to say.
[time=1688] And the tennis players have stopped and the ball trickles to a standstill because everyone wants to know what E.F. Hutton says.
[time=1695] There's a commercial and the implication is that the name of E.F. Hutton demands an eager expectation that which turns the head away from everything else because what is taking place is of such great value.
[time=1709] Well, there was a name that captivated the attention of the apostle Paul.
[time=1714] It wasn't a financial broker. It was the name Jesus Christ.
[time=1720] Jesus Christ so captivated Paul's attention that he was totally incapable of paying serious attention to anything else.
[time=1729] The name of Jesus Christ to the apostle Paul was mind-consuming and totally captivating.
[time=1735] As he would work from Jerusalem to Damascus, that he might persecute Christians, Jesus Christ would appear to him and so captivate his mind that he would consume his heart and intention for the rest of the life of the apostle Paul.
[time=1749] There would be a dedication to magnify Jesus Christ.
[time=1754] That sums up that central purpose of Paul that he might magnify Christ.
[time=1761] But yet with that great dynamic personality of the apostle Paul that just seems to be an eternal reservoir of excitement and of power, there is also concern.
[time=1773] For he said this in verse 20, "That in nothing I shall be ashamed."
[time=1780] When we think of being ashamed, we think of embarrassment.
[time=1784] Perhaps you can think of some rather embarrassing moments in life.
[time=1789] I remember as a swimmer competing, I entered a race, and I was so far behind that I literally thought I won.
[time=1796] I touched the wall, looked down the line, and there was not a soul there.
[time=1801] I didn't win. I was so far behind. Everyone else had finished, gotten out of the poem, dried off.
[time=1807] I was embarrassed. I was ashamed.
[time=1811] But that's not really what the apostle Paul was saying when he said, "I don't want to be ashamed."
[time=1817] That little word ashamed has within it the idea of to be disappointed.
[time=1823] You may have lodged back in your mind Isaiah's encouragement to wait upon the Lord.
[time=1829] Isaiah 40-31 says, "Yay, they who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
[time=1835] They shall mount up with wings like eagles. They shall run and not be weary and walk and not faint."
[time=1843] But you know, during those times when God calls us to wait upon the Lord, there's a great possibility that we'd be disappointed.
[time=1853] But Isaiah, chapter 49, verse 23 says this, "They that wait upon the Lord shall not be ashamed.
[time=1861] They shall not be disappointed." But you know, the apostle Paul was not speaking of disappointment, and that would God disappoint him.
[time=1870] He was saying that I might not disappoint God.
[time=1873] Paul had great confidence in his God.
[time=1876] He said, "I am not ashamed for I know whom I believe in, and I am persuaded that he is able
[time=1882] to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
[time=1887] To keep that which I have committed is really a financial term.
[time=1891] It refers to an individual going to the bank and putting a deposit in the bank and being confident that his deposit will be kept until the day that he comes to withdraw it."
[time=1903] Some of you may remember, October the 29th, a great day of disaster, not October the 29th, 52.
[time=1910] That's when I was born. That was a disaster for some.
[time=1913] But there was another October 29th, a little bit more significant.
[time=1917] It was back in 1929, when it seemed like the stock market was just the greatest investment.
[time=1923] And were those that made a deposit and made a commitment and to this financial scheme of investment.
[time=1929] October the 29th, 1929, the stock market crashed.
[time=1935] And no one could say, "I am confident that that company of which I have committed was able to keep it until the day that I wanted." The apostle Paul would say, "I have confidence in God." First, second Timothy, chapter 1, verse 12, "I am not ashamed.
[time=1951] I am not disappointed because I know he is able to keep that which I have committed."
[time=1957] But the apostle Paul was concerned about himself.
[time=1960] Would he be a disappointment?
[time=1962] And it does my heart good to know that the apostle Paul had concerns.
[time=1967] You know, so many times we have this success image that the Christian leader is so successful, and they never stumble, they never fall, they never get discouraged, but to know the apostle Paul would be concerned that he would not be ashamed that he would not be the disappointment.
[time=1983] But that his life might have boldness.
[time=1985] There might be a confidence that word boldness means to make a public display, a public testimony.
[time=1992] At the end of each service, we give a public invitation, and there are those that say, "Why give a public invitation?" Because Jesus Christ said, "Whosoever should confess me before men, of him what I confess before my father, and that we would have the boldness to not be ashamed
[time=2009] but to make public our faith in Jesus Christ." You know, the apostle Paul had a reservoir for confidence.
[time=2017] He had a reservoir where he would draw that confidence from.
[time=2020] Look at verse 19, it says, "For I know this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[time=2031] When the little word "salvation" occurs, that word can have a variety of meanings.
[time=2036] It can refer to the salvation.
[time=2038] I remember being a lifeguard.
[time=2040] Just a few weeks ago, I put into practice some of my life-saving ability.
[time=2045] As a lifeguard, you learn a lot of different techniques, and we're on a canoe trip, and it looked like some individuals trying to get their canoe out of the rapids, and someone said, "Rick, I think they're drowning." So like a hero, I jumped in and swam and put across chest care and started pulling him, and Ken Nichols said, "Rick, it's only about four foot of water." I really had two options.
[time=2065] I could have been a hero, or I could have just stood up and said, "Here." But the little word "salvation" can really refer to that which saves from a particular consequence.
[time=2074] Someone's drowning, you pull them out.
[time=2077] Someone's in the dilemma, and you provide a way of escape.
[time=2080] That's salvation.
[time=2082] Apostle Paul might have been speaking here of deliverance from prison.
[time=2087] He may have been speaking of salvation, deliverance from the eternal punishment of hell, because Jesus Christ had provided that escape also.
[time=2096] Basically, within the context, it's probably good that we understand that salvation refers to Paul as confident, not only that Jesus Christ can deliver him from prison, but that Jesus Christ has provided eternal salvation.
[time=2110] And so there is the need for Paul, with that confidence, to be able to stand.
[time=2115] He says he can do that through the supply of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2119] In the pages of John, the beloved apostle wrote about the last meeting
[time=2126] that Jesus would have with His disciples, and how we would prepare them for His death.
[time=2133] And in John chapter 14, Jesus promises them that He would send the Holy Spirit, and He said, "I will not leave you comfortless, but I will send you another comforter."
[time=2144] And so the promise of the supply of the Spirit is that God would give comfort in the time of need.
[time=2151] But also in John the 14th chapter, Jesus said that He shall bring to remembrance, and He shall teach you all things that the Spirit of God would not only bring comfort, but that He would also bring counsel.
[time=2164] And then in the 15th chapter, John records Jesus as saying that the Spirit of God would give to them courage.
[time=2173] And then in the 16th chapter, Jesus said these words, "The Spirit of truth shall come, and He shall convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, that the Holy Spirit would give not only courage, but conviction." So the apostle Paul would sit in a Roman prison with a burning desire, knowing that he wanted to magnify Christ, but then in magnifying Christ there would need to be the supply of the Spirit of God for comfort, for courage, for counsel, for conviction.
[time=2209] And with the supply of the Spirit, then he could magnify Christ, his driving, consuming purpose.
[time=2217] You know, I have to ask the question.
[time=2219] How can I magnify Jesus Christ?
[time=2223] How can a wicked, sinful human being magnify our Holy God?
[time=2229] How can a frail body that gets battered and bruised and is weak?
[time=2235] How can that be used to magnify and to declare the majesty of God?
[time=2241] What can I give to Him?
[time=2244] What could this poor wounded soul bring that would magnify the name of Jesus Christ?
[time=2252] It's important that you know the word magnify does not really mean to add to.
[time=2258] The word magnify means to show greatness, to declare, like a telescope.
[time=2267] Scientists and astronomers tell us that some of the most powerful stars are so distant that we scarcely see them on a clear night.
[time=2276] But when a scientist looks at that star through a telescope then there begins to be the revelation of its beauty, of its radiance, and of its power.
[time=2287] And we are the magnifying glass, the telescope, that takes the distant God of heaven and brings Him very near.
[time=2296] The apostle Paul said that I might magnify Him in my body.
[time=2301] For you see, God lives in His children.
[time=2305] And if He is to be seen at all, He must be seen in the lives of His children.
[time=2313] The Shekinah glory of God is a term that refers to that external appearance of the glory of God.
[time=2320] Perhaps you remember Moses, one up on Mount Sinai, and there encountered the glory of God.
[time=2327] And there would be a bush and that bush would burst forth into flames, but not be consumed.
[time=2333] And so impressive would the glory of God be that the apostle Paul would speak about that same glory,
[time=2340] that as Moses's face was lit up with the glory of God, so our lives could reflect the glory of Jesus Christ.
[time=2349] God does not live in buildings.
[time=2353] God is not inhabited in this auditorium.
[time=2356] He is not inhabiting the sanctuaries of the majestic cathedrals of Rome, of France.
[time=2363] He does not inhabit that beautiful dome of Notre Dame.
[time=2367] God only inhabits the lives of people.
[time=2371] But you say, I remember the glory of God came into Solomon's temple.
[time=2375] But do you remember Solomon's prayer?
[time=2378] When he said, "Oh God, thy glory and thy person is so great that the firmament in the sky cannot contain it." Let alone a building made with hands.
[time=2389] When Jesus Christ was upon this earth, he said, "I am the light of the earth.
[time=2396] If men follow me, they shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life."
[time=2402] But there was a transfer that took place, that as Jesus had three years to minister, to be the light of the world, that there was a transfer.
[time=2411] And so when Matthew, the fifth chapter he says to his followers, "You are the light of the world." So let your light shine before men that they will see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
[time=2428] Howard Hendricks tells the story of flying into Dallas and there was a storm that was about and the plane was being held up about 20,000 feet.
[time=2437] And the plane was circling and trying to make approach, but the weather just was not agreeable.
[time=2442] They were having ground trouble.
[time=2444] And trying to pacify the flight of the people that were on that flight,
[time=2450] the stewardess came out and they offered cocktails and soft drinks and little bags of pretzels.
[time=2456] And there was one man that every orbit, he ordered one more round of the spirit.
[time=2460] And before they were even close to landing, he was pretty well full of the spirit.
[time=2465] It wasn't the Holy Spirit.
[time=2467] And the more he drank, the more obnoxious he became.
[time=2470] And he began to denounce the stupid airline and the dumb pilot and the ground control.
[time=2476] Why couldn't they just land this plane and he had places to go?
[time=2479] And he just grew more and more obnoxious.
[time=2482] There's this one steward, as Howard Hendricks tells about, who just was so gracious and so kind, was sympathetic to his frustration
[time=2491] and never denounced him and ridiculed him and spoke back hustily.
[time=2496] She was just so gracious.
[time=2498] This happened time and time again.
[time=2500] And finally, the plane landed and everyone left and the stewardess was busy cleaning up.
[time=2505] And Dr. Hendricks said to her young lady, "I just want you to know how impressed I was with the way you handled that rather obnoxious gentleman.
[time=2513] You're truly a credit to the American Airlines and I know that your employer must be proud of you."
[time=2519] And I said, "Oh, sir, I don't work for American Airlines." He said, "You're kidding." "You took all that grief and you don't even work for American Airlines?" She said, "No, sir. I work for Jesus Christ." "Oh, wouldn't it be a delight today if our lives so magnified Jesus Christ
[time=2540] that as individuals saw the character and the conduct of our lives, it demanded an explanation. And where those that came and sought out the explanation,
[time=2550] we would say, "I don't work for Phelps Dodge.
[time=2553] I don't work for mutual security. I don't work for Parkview Hospital.
[time=2558] I don't work for industrial harvester. There aren't many that do.
[time=2562] I work for Jesus Christ."
[time=2569] "A life that demands an explanation. Who do you work for? Who do you represent?"
[time=2576] The apostle Paul said, "Oh, that I might magnify him." You know, John the Baptist had that attitude.
[time=2583] John the Baptist probably was one of the most popular preachers in all of the nation of Israel.
[time=2589] The multitudes came out to the wilderness to see him.
[time=2592] Could you imagine holding church in the wilderness?
[time=2595] We can't even get them to park across the street.
[time=2598] And here they came to the wilderness to hear John the Baptist.
[time=2602] Great multitudes.
[time=2604] But now there's this new individual, Jesus Christ.
[time=2608] And the multitudes are starting to follow him.
[time=2610] And some of the followers of John say, "John, we were reading in the Gallup poll and it says the ratings are slipping. You better do something." He said, "This is prime television time. The Nielsen ratings are going to go down.
[time=2623] Let's get this show together. This Jesus is taking over in popularity." And John simply said this, "He must increase and I must decrease."
[time=2635] Men and women, that is the key to magnifying Jesus Christ.
[time=2639] That I must decrease.
[time=2643] You know, the greatest hindrance to people seeing Jesus Christ in my life is me.
[time=2650] I am a human.
[time=2653] Because I am a human, I possess some of those general attributes of all humanity.
[time=2659] Arrogance, pride, bitterness, strife, self advancement,
[time=2666] and every one of those is the opposite of what needs to be in our life so that others can see him.
[time=2673] You know, I love to greet you on Sunday morning and I'm not picking on anyone.
[time=2678] And I appreciate your encouragement.
[time=2680] But you know that so many times people come out and say, "Boy, I love that joke. I love to laugh too."
[time=2688] And it's good that we have joy in this house that we laugh.
[time=2691] But you know, if what you remember, the jokes, boy, what a failure.
[time=2697] And there are those of you who come out and say, "Oh, I like that history." You know, I've had more requests for a little book on strange things that happen in the White House
[time=2706] than we've had requests for cassette tapes about the message so far.
[time=2710] And you know, I love history too.
[time=2713] But if what you really remember is the little bit of history that FDR offered hot dogs to the Queen and King of England,
[time=2720] or that Gerald Ford came to his own wedding in one black shoe and one brown shoe, you know, boy, we've really missed the point.
[time=2728] And if you really just remember one powerful anthem the choir sang
[time=2734] and it was so exciting to hear those men singing that brovesto male voice,
[time=2740] you missed the point.
[time=2742] You've only seen the choir and you've only heard the music.
[time=2746] And you've only laughed at the joke and you've only remembered the funny little quirks of history than what you have seen as a human singer and a human preacher.
[time=2757] And old today that from the Word of God and from the songs that we sing,
[time=2763] we would see Jesus Christ and that He would be magnified in our body.
[time=2768] It's so important that we decrease, that He might increase.
[time=2774] I was so excited this week some businessmen in our church called, and they wanted to know if we could have lunch together.
[time=2781] And as soon as they offered to buy, I was sure that my schedule would afford the time.
[time=2786] And we went down to their office and they just really wanted an opportunity to share about this new business they began.
[time=2794] And they shared that their name was kind of a double name.
[time=2797] It not only referred to their type of business, but it also referred to their belief in Jesus Christ.
[time=2804] And so that when someone might perhaps ask about their name, they could not only tell them about designing, but they could tell them about the master design of Jesus Christ.
[time=2814] And these men developed a little logo and they began to explain to me how it was equilibrium and stress was working against stress.
[time=2822] And that particular design was an architectural scheme.
[time=2826] But then they began to see, but look at the Christian life in here, and how Jesus Christ brings balance.
[time=2831] And they're hoping, they're hoping that someone will look at that logo and say, "What does this mean?" And they don't want to tell them about design and schematics and structure and stress.
[time=2841] They want to use that as an opportunity to tell them about Jesus Christ.
[time=2845] Could you imagine the response if all of us had that desire to magnify God in our business?
[time=2853] You know, it's so important today that we don't confuse magnifying Jesus Christ with being a singer or a preacher or a missionary.
[time=2861] Do you know as I go around town and I knock on a door and I attempt to share my faith in Jesus Christ, if they don't know who I am, they listen. And they're interested.
[time=2872] But if they know that I am a preacher, they kind of sit back and say, "Oh yes, he's a preacher." He's supposed to say all those kind of things.
[time=2881] But when you say it, it shocks him to death.
[time=2885] And the greatest witness to Jesus Christ is not a pulpit.
[time=2889] It's a life. God lives in people, and we can magnify Him in our body.
[time=2897] And oh that each of us this week would burn with the desire to magnify Jesus Christ in our body.
[time=2905] The Apostle Paul would say, "Not only in my life, but in my death." Do you know in this country there was a great history of those that believed in something that was worth dying for?
[time=2917] I remember reading the graded dress of Patrick Henry to the house of Burgesses in 1600s. And he stood out before those people and he said, "Is life so dear? Is peace so sweet
[time=2933] that it is to be bought at the price of chains and slavery?
[time=2938] God forbid. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death." And there was a desire to believe in something that was worth dying for.
[time=2951] And when they were about to hang an American sailor, his only cry was, "I only regret that I have one life to give for my country." But somewhere between 1600s and 1700s and 1981 we've come up with this philosophy that there is nothing worth dying for.
[time=2971] And men and women, the tragedy of that is this, that once an individual believes that there is nothing worth dying for, they quickly deduce that there is nothing worth living for.
[time=2986] What would you live for? What would you die for?
[time=2990] I'm amazed at the depth of commitment people make to something that they will never be the beneficiary of.
[time=2997] I'm amazed at the life-giving commitment that people have to that which is not eternal.
[time=3004] A young man was engaged to a young gal.
[time=3007] He went into Mexico to go to school and he came across a group of people who were communists.
[time=3013] They so persuaded him, in his doctrine, that he broke his engagement and wrote this letter to his girlfriend.
[time=3022] He said this, "We communists have a high casualty rate.
[time=3027] We are the ones who get shot and hung and lynched and tarred and feathered and jailed and slander and ridiculed and fired from our jobs.
[time=3039] We are in every way made as uncomfortable as possible.
[time=3044] We are certainly imprisoned and killed.
[time=3048] We live in virtual poverty.
[time=3051] We turn back to the party, every penny we make, above that which is absolutely necessary to live off of.
[time=3059] We communists don't have time for money, for movies, for concerts, for t-bone steaks, for new homes or fine cars.
[time=3070] We've been described as fanatics.
[time=3073] Our lives are dominated by one great overshadowing factor.
[time=3078] We struggle for world communism.
[time=3081] We communism, communists have a philosophy of life which no amount of money could buy.
[time=3087] We have a cause to fight for.
[time=3089] We have a definite purpose in life.
[time=3092] We subordinate our petty personal selves into a greater movement of humanity.
[time=3099] And if our personal lives seem hard, if our egos appear to suffer through subordination to the party, then we are adequately compensated by the thought that each one of us,
[time=3113] in his small way is contributing to something new and true and better for all mankind.
[time=3121] There is one thing in which I am in dead earnest, and that is the communist cause.
[time=3130] It is my life.
[time=3132] It is my business, my religion, my wife, my mistress, my sweetheart, my hobby, my bread, and my meat.
[time=3140] I work at it in the daytime and I dream of it at the nighttime.
[time=3145] It holds on to me.
[time=3146] It grows not lessening as time goes on.
[time=3149] Therefore, I cannot carry on a friendship, a love affair, or even a conversation without relating it to the communist party which both drives and guides my life.
[time=3161] I evaluate people, books, ideas, actions according to how they affect the communist cause and by their attitude towards it.
[time=3171] I have already been in jail because of my ideas and if necessary, I am ready to stand before the firing squad.
[time=3180] Can you imagine that type of commitment and devotion to a political cause
[time=3186] that will probably end his life and at that point he has absolutely nothing to gain?
[time=3194] But you know, we come.
[time=3197] When we come, we say, "Oh, I love him and I want to magnify him in my body."
[time=3203] But does that type of commitment reflect my commitment?
[time=3207] I really don't know.
[time=3209] And I can't just challenge you today to evaluate your own heart.
[time=3213] I have to evaluate mine.
[time=3215] Is Jesus Christ my bread and my meat?
[time=3218] Can I carry on a friendship?
[time=3220] Do I evaluate every affair of business in my life on that one purpose?
[time=3225] Paul said he did.
[time=3227] He said, "I evaluate it that whether I live or die, I want to magnify Christ."
[time=3234] You know, it's so easy to say I would live for a cause and I would die for a cause.
[time=3239] But most of us don't know that for which we would die until the moment arises.
[time=3246] But the man who wrote these words, the apostle Paul, nowhere have he spoke.
[time=3251] He was the frequent target of assassination plots.
[time=3255] He had been in prison many, many times.
[time=3257] He wrote from a prison.
[time=3259] He wrote under the sentence of death, unless Caesar intervened, he was a dead man.
[time=3264] Not only that, there was a point in Paul's life that as he made a missionary journey into the city of Lystra,
[time=3271] there were those that were hostile to his message and they bound him and they took him outside of the city and they circled about him and they stoned him and they stoned him until they believed that he was dead.
[time=3283] Now that same man who had already been stoned for Jesus Christ would say,
[time=3291] "I am willing to die for him." But you know there's a far more important question.
[time=3299] The question is this, would you live for him?
[time=3304] Would you live for him?
[time=3307] You see, those that can die in a moment of heroics are in a spontaneous response to a need
[time=3316] but to live for him demands every day of our life.
[time=3322] Oh, that I might magnify him, that I might magnify him in my body.
[time=3331] Would you magnify him in your body?
[time=3334] Would you magnify him in your body, whether it meant your life or your death?
[time=3341] That's how the apostle Paul had come to live.
[time=3344] So that in verse 21 he could say, "Whether I live, it's for Christ.
[time=3348] If I die, it's Christ. For me to live is Christ and to die is game."
[time=3355] There was a great Christian who lived in the fourth century by the name of John Christosum.
[time=3360] And John Christosum was brought before the emperor and the emperor was trying to threaten him to denounce Christianity.
[time=3367] And the emperor said this, "I'll take away from you your property." And Christosum replied, "You cannot take away my property for my treasure is in heaven."
[time=3378] Then he said, "I'll take away your loved ones." And he said, "You cannot take away my loved ones. They're already in heaven." "Then I'll take away your life." And Christosum said this, "You cannot take away my life because my life is Christ.
[time=3393] And if you take it, I'll go to be with him." And that puts you in solitary confinement. John Christosum said, "You cannot put me in confinement because he said,
[time=3404] "I will never leave you nor forsake you." The apostle Paul would say, "For me to live is Christ and to die is game."
[time=3416] If we were to survey men, the four closest employees in your business, what would they say that you live for?
[time=3425] If we were to ask your family, "What does your mother live for?" What would they say?
[time=3433] Before you answer the question, I would die for him.
[time=3437] You must answer the question today. Would I live for him?
[time=3441] Let's pray together.
[time=3443] This morning, as we've studied the book of Philippians, we've talked primarily to Christians.
[time=3449] But the most important thing today is that you know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior,
[time=3455] and that you invite Him in your heart. You could pray and ask Him to come in and be your Lord and Savior.
[time=3461] Pray today and invite Him into your heart.
[time=3465] Our Father, it's the desire of our life.
