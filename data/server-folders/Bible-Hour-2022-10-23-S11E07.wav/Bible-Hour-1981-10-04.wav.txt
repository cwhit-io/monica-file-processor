[time=19] >> From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=43] >> Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=45] >> We want to welcome you a good morning on this Lord's Day
[time=51] and say a special word of welcome to two groups of people.
[time=56] First, you who are visiting here today as a part of our friend day were so thankful that you've come to visit with us this morning and to worship together.
[time=65] Then we also want to say hello to our television family, the Bible Hour, who are joining us this morning for this worship service.
[time=72] We're looking forward to today's service.
[time=74] We have special guests with us, the sunlight quartet who are going to sing for us.
[time=79] We're going to hear from star in our world one of our own musicians, but right now the choir is going to lead us in a great hymn of praise under the direction of Mr. Don Krueger.
[time=90] [MUSIC]
[time=97] >> Enter into this gift, thanks given.
[time=101] Enter into this course with praise.
[time=104] Enter into this gift, thanks given.
[time=108] Enter into this course with praise.
[time=115] Be thankful after me, oh blessed and make alone, bless his name his way.
[time=129] Enter into this gift, thanks given, enter into his course with praise.
[time=140] Enter into this gift, thanks given.
[time=144] Enter into this course with praise, for the Lord our God is good.
[time=154] His mercy is everlasting, and his truth and merit to all.
[time=163] Enter into this gift, thanks given, enter into this course with praise.
[time=182] with praise, thanks given, enter into this course with praise.
[time=197] >> I know that that great hymn of praise lifted your hearts,
[time=204] and we're so thankful for the ministry of music that's able to take the word of God and to penetrate our heart that we might know something of the majesty of God.
[time=213] This morning we have as our special guest, the sunlight quartet.
[time=218] It was in the spring, I believe, of this year that we came to meet them for the first time when they sang here on a Sunday evening service, and at that time they so thrilled our hearts
[time=229] with their ministry of music, and this morning they're going to sing for us and then tonight also, and now they're going to sing for us the first day in glory,
[time=239] the sunlight quartet.
[time=240] [MUSIC]
[time=245] >> Oh, it's a great, great morning, you're first day in heaven when you stroll down the Golden Avenue, there are mansions left and right, and you thrills every side,
[time=255] and the saints are always smiling, saying, how do you do?
[time=258] Oh, it's a great, great morning, you're first day in heaven when you realize you were in days are through, you'll be glad you're not idle, and it's a time to reach your Bible, it's a great morning for you.
[time=271] >> Well, I had a dream, I now confess I hated to awake, I dreamt I was an angel at the Great
[time=277] Burly Gate, well St. Peterson.
[time=279] >> Howdy all, where have you been?
[time=281] >> No, you've got your mansion ready, so come on in.
[time=284] >> Well, it's any rain, morning, just to act as a guy.
[time=288] >> We spread his wings a time or two, and he learned how to fly.
[time=291] It's a great, great morning, you're first day in heaven when you stroll down the Golden Avenue, there are mansions left and right, and you thrills every side, and the saints
[time=302] are always smiling, saying, how do you do?
[time=304] Oh, it's a great, great morning, you're first day in heaven when you realize you were in
[time=310] days are through, you'll be glad you're not idle, and it's a time to reach your Bible, it's a great morning, a great morning, what I have been today.
[time=326] >> Good morning, and good morning to you.
[time=336] Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=339] It's been exciting to be a part of the Morning Worship Service.
[time=343] I love that song that the sunlight quartet just sang about the first day in glory.
[time=348] Won't it be exciting to see Jesus Christ for the very first time, and to know him personally
[time=354] and look straight into his eyes and see the Savior who died for us, boy, that song just was a tremendous encouragement to me, and you know, your letters have also been a real encouragement to both Don and I.
[time=366] We thank you for writing those letters to us, they keep our spirits floating high.
[time=370] And we want to encourage you to continue to do just that, send your letters to us and tell us that you've been listening to the Bible Hour, encourage Pastor Rick, I really appreciated your messages, Pastor Rick, and I know our people have out in the television audience because they've written, and we want you to continue to do just that.
[time=387] Write your letters of encouragement to us.
[time=389] >> Don, you know, next week we have a special guest with us, Dr. Wilbert Welch, who is the President of Grand Rapids Baptist Bible College and Seminary.
[time=399] He's been here before, and our people have just loved his ministry.
[time=402] I hope you'll make a special effort next week to watch the Bible Hour and perhaps even
[time=408] go so far as to invite a friend to join you that you might share with them the life-changing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=415] We have something we'd like to share with you.
[time=418] You remember last week that Dr. Ken Nichols of our staff joined us to share with you a little booklet entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=426] Don, why don't you share a little bit about this booklet with our viewers?
[time=430] >> This is a very practical book, Pastor Rick.
[time=433] It's called Remedies for Negative Thinking, and many of us are involved in thinking thoughts that are negative and not positive.
[time=440] And as we continue to do that, we experience ill health, ill-emotional health, and that
[time=446] is not good for us.
[time=447] And the Word of God tells us that, and Dr. Ken has written this very, very practical book on Remedies for Negative Thinking, it is from a biblical aspect.
[time=458] It's very, very practical, and even though Dr. Ken is a licensed psychologist, it's written very, very down to earth, very practical for ordinary laymen to be able to read.
[time=469] It has some subtitles like overcoming the conflict that you experience in your life.
[time=473] The Bible is the first step to overcoming this conflict, talking with God, every thought
[time=480] being brought into captivity.
[time=481] It's a tremendous little book, and we like to offer this to you.
[time=484] If you'd like to have this book, please write to the Bible Hour.
[time=489] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we would be just delighted
[time=497] to send you this book.
[time=498] It's entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking, and it's written by our own Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=504] >> Thank you, Don.
[time=505] I know that just knowing Ken Nichols is a real encouragement to my life.
[time=509] He has a tremendous ministry of what he calls preventative counseling, helping us think biblically before we begin to encounter different problems in our spiritual or emotional life,
[time=520] and we'd love to send you this booklet.
[time=522] If you'll just write to us today, write to the Bible Hour, Box 15000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=530] zip code 46815.
[time=534] Thank you again for joining us today, and now as we go back to the morning service, we're going to hear again from the Sunline Quartet, and also from our own friend, Star Narwhalte.
[time=545] Thank you today.
[time=546] Take this opportunity to share Jesus Christ with a friend, and invite them to join you to watch the Bible Hour each week.
[time=569] Let me see this world, dear Lord, as though I were looking through your eyes, the world
[time=597] you were, but a world for which you died, let me kneel with you in the garden, through
[time=616] my eyes with tears of agony, for if once I could see this world, the way you see, I
[time=635] just know, lights are you more faithfully, let me see this world, dear Lord, through
[time=661] your eyes, when men loved your holy name, when they beat you, and spat upon you, Lord,
[time=680] let me love them as you love them, just the same, let me stand high above my petty problems
[time=697] and breathe for men, hell bound eternally, for if once I could see this world, the way you see, I just know, I'd serve you more faithfully, I'd serve you more faithfully.
[time=727] Thank you, Starr, for that beautiful song that calls for our devotion to Jesus Christ.
[time=746] Next week we want you to make a special effort to be with us as we have as our guest, Dr.
[time=752] Welch, Dr. Wilbert Welch is the president of Grand Rapids Baptist Bible College and Theological
[time=758] Seminary. He's been here several times in the past and has always had a tremendous ministry of encouragement. We hope that you'll make a special effort, he'll be with us next Sunday morning and next Sunday evening. Also, for those of you who are watching the Bible
[time=774] Hour today in Fort Wayne, tonight the sunlight quartet will be back with us here in this auditorium at seven o'clock and we'll hear a special ministry of music from them. They've
[time=785] come back now to sing for us a favorite of mine, Praise the Lord, the sunlight quartet.
[time=809] When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams and your hopes have
[time=818] been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes and you feel the urge within you
[time=827] to submit to earthly fears. Don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear.
[time=837] Praise the Lord, he can work through those who praise him. Praise the Lord for our God
[time=847] and have its praise. Praise the Lord for those chains that seem to find you.
[time=858] There's only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him.
[time=870] Now Satan hears a liar and he wants to make us think that we are paupers when he knows
[time=881] himself we are children of the king. So lift up the mind, he shield the faith for
[time=889] the battle must be won. We know that Jesus Christ is risen. So the works already done.
[time=898] Praise the Lord, he can work through those who praise him. Praise the Lord for our God
[time=909] and have its praise. Praise the Lord for those chains that seem to find you.
[time=918] There's only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him.
[time=930] Praise the Lord, he can work through those who praise him. Praise the Lord for our
[time=942] God and have its praise. Praise the Lord for those chains that seem to find you.
[time=951] You serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him.
[time=960] Praise the Lord when you praise him when you praise him.
[time=977] When you praise the Lord.
[time=1001] Thank you. In Psalms the Bible tells us that God inhabits the praise of his people.
[time=1012] That means he literally lives with inside us. We like to close our portion of music
[time=1018] in this service with a song taken straight from scripture, a song we really enjoyed.
[time=1022] It gives each one of us strength, taken from Psalms the 27th chapter, which states the Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
[time=1032] The Lord, he is the very strength of my life. We entitled this song, David's Song.
[time=1038] The Lord is my light and my salvation, who shall I fear?
[time=1096] If God be for us, then who can be against us?
[time=1107] Who can be against us?
[time=1118] Are he the Lord is with me?
[time=1134] The Lord is my strength and my redeemer, who shall I fear?
[time=1163] Although I know, I walk through the valley.
[time=1173] I know, I fear, although I know.
[time=1191] He is with me.
[time=1201] The Lord is our light and our salvation, who shall I fear?
[time=1220] Who shall we fear?
[time=1259] Let's pray together.
[time=1268] Our Father, we are thankful this morning that you are our God, who cares about our lives.
[time=1274] When we put our trust in our faith in Christ Jesus, there is a confidence that can come to our lives, that we need not be afraid.
[time=1283] And Father, our prayer this morning is that in this hour, as we study your Word, the Spirit of God would bring to our lives the reality of salvation in Christ Jesus.
[time=1294] That those who know Him would be encouraged today to know that in Him is life, life eternal.
[time=1301] And that through the teaching of your Word, lives would be strengthened, that spiritual growth would take place.
[time=1307] Most of all, Father, if there are those today who hear your Word and don't know Christ, don't know the life and salvation that He offers, the forgiveness of sins that is in Him.
[time=1319] Father, we pray that this morning your Word would penetrate their hearts, that they would see none other than Jesus Christ through the spoken Word.
[time=1328] We pray this, that Jesus Christ might be magnified and glorified. Amen.
[time=1335] The great American poet, Robert Frost, said this, "Two paths diverged into the woods, and I chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."
[time=1350] What Robert Frost was saying is that life is full of choices, that each of us in the affairs of our daily life make decisions.
[time=1360] There is within the scheme of making decisions, opportunities for input, the values of people around us, leadership from those we respect, but all of us make choices.
[time=1373] In his poetry, he said, "There are two paths, and I chose the one less traveled by."
[time=1381] What Frost was saying is there seems to be a popular trend in life. In a given time in history, a culture, a society takes on a mentality, a set of values, and the people within that society begin to flow in a commonly traveled path.
[time=1399] The will of the majority, Richard Nixon, often spoke about the silent majority, that general trend that our cultures seem to be flowing on.
[time=1409] But Frost also spoke of an alternative, a choice that could be made, and as he reviewed his own life, he said, "I made a choice, and I chose a unique path."
[time=1421] He said, "In choosing that unique path, my choice has made all the difference in life."
[time=1428] Writing Shakespeare and Julius Caesar spoke about the value of choice, and in his work, Shakespeare had Julius Caesar say these words.
[time=1441] "There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune, omitted all the voice of their life is bound in shallow and in misery."
[time=1458] What was Shakespeare saying? He was saying that men and women face single decisions in life. Just like the tide of an ocean crest at a given point, if an individual chooses wisely at that opportunity, then their life is characterized by the good fortune of that choice.
[time=1477] But should the individual come to that point of decision in their life and come to that point of choice and omit the decision, then the rest of their life is spent in the shallows and in misery, choice, making decisions?
[time=1494] You and I make decisions day by day, and many of those decisions not only influenced that given day, but the entire character and nature and destiny of our lives. Zachary Taylor was a general in the Mexican War in the 1840s. He was a frugal man. He didn't like to spend money.
[time=1514] And a letter came to him one day, postage due, and Zachary Taylor not wanting to spend money determined that if somebody thought they had something to say to him, then they ought to have the decency to pay for it, and he refused to pay postage on the letter.
[time=1528] The letter was sent to inform him that he had been nominated for the office of President of the United States of America.
[time=1537] He said, "Oh, I don't make those type of choices. I mean, my mail is not nearly that important. The only thing I get is bills, and I'm not making decisions that really influence the presidency of the United States."
[time=1551] Well, to me, it's interesting to look back to the year 1960, John F. Kennedy, the Democratic nomination, Richard Milhouse Nixon, the Republican. It really looked like it would be a typical Republican victory.
[time=1566] For two terms, I had led the nation successfully. Nixon was his vice president. The grand old party was popular. Kennedy was too young, many said. Other said he comes from a minority background. Kennedy really didn't have a chance. Nixon was the sure winner.
[time=1583] I remember that election. I was a sixth grader. As a sixth grader, they had us running and mock elections. I was Richard Nixon, and I was sure that I was going to win.
[time=1597] Somehow, you already know the rest of the story. But you know in that selection, for the offices of President of the United States, that when broken down, Kennedy beat Nixon by one vote per precinct.
[time=1614] That means that long line that you stand in every second Tuesday, every Tuesday that follows the Monday of November. That long line, if one person had gone the other way, we'd have had a different president.
[time=1631] Choices. You and I make choices daily. And those choices may, at a given moment, seem relatively insignificant. They may seem irrelevant to the affairs of your life. They may seem to be choices that will force you to go against popularity.
[time=1649] But it could very well be that you'll make a choice in your life that will completely affect your destiny where you spend eternity.
[time=1660] Some of you've made some rather important choices. You made a relatively important choice, men and women, when you chose where you would go to college. More than any other factor in your life where you go to college tends to determine who you marry.
[time=1676] That was an important choice. You may not have realized that when you chose to go to a different school that more people meet their spouse based upon where they go to college than any other single criteria.
[time=1688] You made choices in your life. Men, do you remember when you stood in front of a preacher in a gray three-piece suit? And he asked you a question and you answered, "I do." It affected the rest of your life, didn't it?
[time=1701] We make choices that affect the rest of our life. Sometimes those choices seem crowded in amidst the affairs of a given day. Sometimes they seem to be a nuisance and a long to-do list. They seem to be crammed in between picking up the kids at school and getting them to the athletic practice, getting the dog to the place to get its haircut and picking up some groceries for dinner and a phone call from your husband to say, "He's bringing guests home for summer."
[time=1730] And it seems that life's important decision somehow get crowded in the life and perhaps many of us have lived ignoring life's greatest question.
[time=1741] What would be life's greatest question? I believe this morning life's greatest question occurs in Matthew chapter 27 verse 22.
[time=1752] Pontius Pilate is standing before an angry mob on one hand and a bound Jesus of Nazareth on the other hand.
[time=1763] It's his desire to let Jesus go, but the mob is calling for the release of a local insurrectionist by the name of Barabbas.
[time=1774] And Pilate asks life's greatest question and he says to the mob, "What would you have me to do with Jesus who is called the Christ?"
[time=1786] I'd like to paraphrase that exact same question this morning and take the role of Pontius Pilate and ask you those same words.
[time=1797] What will you do this morning with Jesus who is called the Christ?
[time=1804] Within the pages of the New Testament, there are four books which we call the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=1813] Each of them give to us a historical account of the life of Christ.
[time=1818] Many of them overlap in their dialogue, but each of them contribute something uniquely to the historicity of the life of Christ.
[time=1828] Matthew tells us something of Christ's trial before Pilate.
[time=1833] Mark gives us a much more abbreviated account and Luke gives to us a unique event that is not included in any of the other Gospels.
[time=1843] John also includes another unique event not included by the Synoptic writers.
[time=1849] And as we weave together the trial of Jesus Christ, the question is what would happen with this person Jesus of Nazareth?
[time=1860] What would you do with him if you were Pontius Pilate?
[time=1864] You know, there's really not a great deal known about Pontius Pilate.
[time=1867] History doesn't record a great deal about him.
[time=1870] Famous historians like Suetonius say relatively little.
[time=1873] Josephus has but a few reference.
[time=1876] He wasn't that well known of a political figure in his day.
[time=1881] It wasn't until the writing of the New Testament about 30 years later that Pilate becomes a significant figure in history.
[time=1891] Little Sunday School group was together and the teacher assigned the Boys and Girls a project of drawing a picture about Christmas.
[time=1898] One little boy drew an airplane. He put in the airplane four people.
[time=1903] And the teacher said, "What does that have to do with Christmas?" And he said, "Well, don't you remember when Herod was killing all the babies?" And the Bible says that there was a flight to Egypt and that's the flight to Egypt.
[time=1916] The teacher is a little bit perplexed. He said, "Well, who are these people?" And he said, "Well, you see this lady? That's Mary. That's baby Jesus's mommy." And the baby is Jesus. And this man in the back is Joseph.
[time=1929] And the teacher said, "Well, who's this man?" He said, "Well, that's Pontius, the pilot." It could be this morning that you don't know a whole lot more about Pontius Pilate than that little Sunday School student.
[time=1942] Pontius Pilate was a Roman military provincial governor.
[time=1947] The Romans, when they conquered a group of people, liked to give to them some sense of autonomy,
[time=1953] of self-rule, of religious freedom, and they would put a military battalion of men,
[time=1959] a company of men, under a Roman governor, a military leader who would control them.
[time=1965] Pontius Pilate was given the responsibility of Jerusalem, the greater problems of Judea
[time=1971] and one problems to the North, Samaria.
[time=1974] Now, I'm not a great historian, but what I do know of history is if I could have been a Roman governor anywhere in the Roman Empire,
[time=1980] either gladly taken any spot other than the spot that was given to Pontius Pilate.
[time=1986] There has always been more trouble focusing in on Jerusalem than any other place on the entire globe,
[time=1993] and Pontius Pilate's day was no exception.
[time=1997] Now, come standing before this governor is a group of religious Jewish leaders,
[time=2004] and they're bringing to Pilate a criminal bound, and they come and they stand before him,
[time=2010] and they ask him to try Jesus.
[time=2013] And in Luke 23, we encounter one reference of the trial of Christ before Pilate.
[time=2021] And in this trial, we discover that Pilate really thinks the whole thing is rather insignificant.
[time=2028] He stands there and he looks at Jesus, and the Jews come and say, "This man has perverted the nation."
[time=2035] He's telling people not to pay their taxes, not to obey Caesar.
[time=2039] He calls himself Christ. He makes himself a king.
[time=2044] Pilate's a little bit bored, I believe, with the whole affair, and he looks at Jesus and he says, "Are you a king?"
[time=2050] Jesus says, "It is so, or yes I am." Pilate says, "I find no fault in him." Dismiss the case.
[time=2060] You see, Pilate really didn't think this Jesus was all that significant.
[time=2064] He was a busy man. He had job pressure.
[time=2067] There were problems that he had to deal with.
[time=2070] He didn't have time for this insignificant Jesus who stood before him as a mockery of a trial,
[time=2077] the suspect of a Jewish plot.
[time=2081] Jesus was far too insignificant for Pilate. I mean, he had to control all of Judea.
[time=2087] Josephus tells us that about this time, Pilate had moved a military group from Caesarea to Jerusalem during the night.
[time=2096] As that military troop came, they bore brazen images made out of bronze of Caesar,
[time=2103] and they hung them around the city as they did everywhere in the Roman Empire.
[time=2107] Well, the Jews would not allow these images in their city because they believed that they were making a god out of a Caesar
[time=2114] and they wouldn't have their city defiled religiously.
[time=2117] And an angry mob gathered outside of Pilate's palace, demanding that he take him down.
[time=2124] Rising to the occasion, Pilate surrounded that mob with his military might.
[time=2130] Swords drawnly marched at the crowd, and Pilate said, disband, or your heads will roll.
[time=2137] And those Jewish people knelt to the ground, pulled back their cloaks, and bore their neck, and said, "We will die."
[time=2144] Now, what do you do?
[time=2147] Pilate had to give in.
[time=2149] He turned the soldiers away. He took the images of Caesar down, the Jews won. He had problems.
[time=2155] Mount Gerasim in Samaria, just to the north.
[time=2159] There were a whole group of Samaritans that gathered there for political insurrection.
[time=2164] They were going to overthrow the Romans, and Pilate had to respond.
[time=2169] He had to go. He had to put those problems down.
[time=2172] There were always problems in Jerusalem, in Judea and Samaria.
[time=2177] He didn't have time to wonder about this one called Jesus.
[time=2182] He was far too insignificant. He had a busy schedule.
[time=2186] He didn't have time to answer life's greatest question.
[time=2191] Well, you know, Pilate is not the only one who lives under stress.
[time=2196] Many of you here this morning live under a great deal of stress.
[time=2200] This morning, in talking with Dr. Nichols, our staff counselor, he just came back from a retreat, a weekend of oneness, where couples spent time together, focusing in on their marriage, and he asked them to identify what the greatest strain was on their marriage.
[time=2215] I guessed finances. That wasn't correct.
[time=2218] The greatest strain was the stress of life, trying to keep up with life.
[time=2225] Alvin Toffler wrote in Future Shock about the tremendous stress that change brings into our life,
[time=2232] and many of us cannot keep up. There's pressure.
[time=2236] Many of you this morning have agreed with Pilate that Jesus Christ is far too insignificant to demand any of your time.
[time=2244] You're too busy. You're too busy. You're determined to make it in business.
[time=2249] And there's pressure to work overtime and to get projects completed and to get the goals obtained.
[time=2255] You don't have time for Jesus.
[time=2257] And when you come home, your wife's always there reminding you that you promised to paint the living room before the family reunion, which was yesterday.
[time=2267] Pressure. Strain in life.
[time=2270] The insurance man calls and tells you you need to upgrade your insurance, and you know how persistent an insurance man can be.
[time=2278] And you've got your wife wanting it painted, your boss wanting more work, your insurance man wanting an evening to upgrade your insurance, and you'd just assume die.
[time=2287] Pressure. Stress. You don't have time for philosophy and religion and debate.
[time=2294] You've got three teenagers. You can't keep food on the table.
[time=2298] They get up from the table and the three of them run off in six different directions.
[time=2302] You've got too much pressure.
[time=2304] And Jesus Christ is far too insignificant to demand your attention, to demand your time.
[time=2312] No. Just to miss him. Just to miss him. Send him away.
[time=2318] You know, there are so many that are committed to success in life.
[time=2323] That they climb the proverbial ladder of success to discover at the top that it was leaned against the wrong wall.
[time=2333] What ladder are you climbing this morning?
[time=2336] What is it that brings stress in your life that takes the important things and relegates them to insignificance?
[time=2343] What are you doing today with life's greatest question?
[time=2347] What will you do with Jesus who is called the Christ?
[time=2351] Pilate said he's too insignificant. I've got too many problems.
[time=2355] There's too much pressure. I'm on the ladder. I want to get out of this Jerusalem.
[time=2359] I'm on the ladder. I want to go to Rome and lead in the great empire.
[time=2364] Oh, I don't have time for Jesus. I've got to keep peace in some area.
[time=2369] I've got to keep peace in Jerusalem. I can't control this mob of Jews and you want me to worry about Jesus?
[time=2375] I don't find any fault in him.
[time=2378] You know what Pilate was saying? He was saying he's no threat to my life.
[time=2382] Let him call himself a king. He's no threat to my life.
[time=2387] Have you dismissed Jesus as insignificant?
[time=2392] Well, he demands far greater attention than you're willing to give him this morning.
[time=2396] And he demanded far greater attention than Pilate was willing to give to him.
[time=2401] Pilate wanted just to dismiss the whole affair, but the Jews kept bringing it up and bringing it up and bringing it up.
[time=2409] And finally, Pilate heard that Jesus came from Galilee and he said, "Aha!" That's not my problem.
[time=2416] If he's from Galilee, he's a Galilean and Herod, the tetrarch. He's in charge of Galilee.
[time=2422] That's in the north. That's Herod's problem. Get him out of here.
[time=2427] And he tried to delegate the decision to someone else. He sent him away to Herod.
[time=2433] Now, Herod, he was excited about that. He had heard about Jesus. He had heard about the miracles of Jesus.
[time=2438] And he was excited that Christ was coming.
[time=2442] Herod just happened to be in Jerusalem. Pilate sends Christ over to be tried by Herod.
[time=2447] And Herod hopes that Jesus is going to put on one of his little side shows.
[time=2451] He had really liked to have a little goblet of water and have Jesus turn it into wine.
[time=2455] Or maybe to have Jesus take a small little amount of fish and bread and feed a great pilot.
[time=2462] Send him over and Herod thought, "Boy, this will be neat. I'll get to see some magic.
[time=2466] I'll invite some dinner guests over and we can have this Jesus entertain us." But Jesus was not willing to be an entertainer.
[time=2476] And Herod was disappointed and sent him back.
[time=2479] So the question comes back to Pilate. Pilate tried to dismiss him as insignificant.
[time=2484] He tried to dismiss him as someone else's problem.
[time=2489] This morning you may say Jesus is someone else's problem.
[time=2493] You know men, we need to face our spiritual responsibilities within our family.
[time=2499] It is unfortunate that in this country the men lack spiritual leadership.
[time=2505] It is so commonly known that the men do not make spiritual decisions in the family
[time=2512] that many religions in America now put their emphasis on women.
[time=2516] Because the men say it's not my problem.
[time=2519] I work five days a week, forty hours I put in overtime.
[time=2523] Sunday is my only day off. It's somebody else's problem.
[time=2527] I'll let my wife make the decision. She wants to go to church, fine.
[time=2531] She doesn't want to go to church, fine. She wants to take the kids, that's fine.
[time=2535] It's not my problem.
[time=2538] You know in 1952 Norman Rockwell was so aware of that truth, that American men ignore their spiritual responsibility that he used it as the cover of the Saturday evening post.
[time=2550] He drew a picture of a mother all dressed up for church.
[time=2554] She had her custom 1952 suit on.
[time=2557] She had her little hat with the partial veil that pulled down just over the hairline.
[time=2562] Her white gloves. She was marching out the door.
[time=2565] Right behind her was the lookalike daughter. Little girl had her white gloves.
[time=2569] She had a pocketbook that was just about as big as she was.
[time=2572] And third in the marching order was Junior.
[time=2576] It was obvious that he wasn't used to these Sunday going to meet and close.
[time=2580] He had one tail out and one tail in, and the pants just seemed a bag and the coat was too small.
[time=2586] And you could tell he wasn't real excited about going to church.
[time=2590] But in the foreground sat the father, still on his pajamas, hair looking like an explosion in a mattress factory.
[time=2597] Unshaven pajamas and bathrobe on, sitting, reading the comics and the sports pages with a cup of coffee.
[time=2606] And the caption was Easter Sunday morning.
[time=2611] You know what Rockwell was saying is he drew that picture?
[time=2614] Norman Rockwell was saying that we as men have delegated spiritual leadership.
[time=2620] We said it's someone else's problem.
[time=2622] If my life is not what it ought to be, my wife can take the kids to church.
[time=2627] And we have made Jesus someone else's problem.
[time=2631] We know Herod sent him back. But in Luke 23, verse 8, it says this.
[time=2637] And that same day, Pilate and Herod made friends together for before they were at enmity with each other.
[time=2646] Pilate and Herod never got along.
[time=2650] Pilate sends Jesus to Herod, Jesus is sent back, and somehow Pilate and Herod become friends.
[time=2657] The reason is this, that Jesus Christ demands a decision and there is no neutrality with him.
[time=2664] You are either for Christ or you are against him.
[time=2668] You either accept him or reject him, and Pilate and Herod found one thing in common, they were against Jesus Christ.
[time=2676] And that made friends out of them.
[time=2678] Nothing will bring two enemies together than a third enemy that threatens both of them.
[time=2685] There is no neutrality in Christ, and there became a new political alliance between Pilate and Herod, those who are against Christ.
[time=2695] You may think this morning that you can be neutral.
[time=2698] There is no neutrality with Jesus Christ.
[time=2701] You are either for him or you are against him.
[time=2704] Americans love to be neutral.
[time=2706] There was a particular sensitive bill on the floor of the Senate.
[time=2711] A freshman senator was asked how he was going to vote, and he said, "Well, some of my friends are for it, and some of my friends are against it, and I am for my friends." No, Americans don't like to be neutral.
[time=2725] They like to avoid the issue, and Jesus Christ demands an answer.
[time=2730] What will you do with him this morning?
[time=2733] The story is told.
[time=2734] I am sure it is not true, but it is fun to tell.
[time=2737] A young man in the Civil War who didn't want to take sides, so he put on a blue coat and grey trousers and got shot at from both sides.
[time=2745] You may think this morning that you can go halfway with Jesus Christ.
[time=2750] You can kind of stand in the middle, and you don't want to get real excited.
[time=2755] You don't want to be anti-Jesus.
[time=2757] You don't want to get real hot or real cold.
[time=2759] You just want to be kind of warm in the middle.
[time=2763] You know what Jesus said to that? I would, that thou were cold or hot.
[time=2768] But because thou are neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth.
[time=2774] There is no neutrality with Jesus Christ, and two enemies found themselves friends in that they were against Jesus Christ, because there is no neutrality in him.
[time=2784] This morning you must make a decision.
[time=2786] The decision is what will you do with Jesus?
[time=2789] You can accept him, or you can reject him.
[time=2793] Pilate tried to dismiss him as insignificant.
[time=2795] He tried to pass him off as someone else's problem.
[time=2799] Then he discovered that it was really a religious matter, and he didn't believe in that religion.
[time=2805] He said, "Jesus is a Jew. You're asking a religious question.
[time=2809] Do you have a trial? Try him yourself.
[time=2812] I don't dabble in religion." You know, Pilate had his own religion. He was a Roman.
[time=2821] He believed in the gods and the goddesses of the Roman pantheon.
[time=2825] He believed in many gods. These Jews believed in one god.
[time=2829] He believed that any god could save him. These Jews believed there would only be one messiah.
[time=2834] They had different religions. And Pilate said, "That's not my religion.
[time=2839] You figure it out yourself." And he tried to avoid the issue again, saying it's a religious problem, and I don't believe in that religion.
[time=2846] No doubt many of you this morning are saying, "I came to a Baptist church, and this is exactly what I expected."
[time=2852] A lot of talk about Jesus Christ and asking him to your heart.
[time=2856] And I just don't believe that Baptist religion.
[time=2859] My friend, can I share with you this morning that that which is a claim of Jesus Christ that you must believe on him and receive him by faith is not a Baptist religion.
[time=2869] That everything we've said this morning about Jesus Christ is what Martin Luther believed about Jesus Christ.
[time=2875] The great reformation started by Martin Luther as the roots of the Baptist church.
[time=2882] And so if you come from a Lutheran background this morning, we haven't said anything that isn't true of what Martin Luther believed.
[time=2888] We haven't said one thing this morning that was not originally a part of the beliefs of the Roman Catholic church.
[time=2896] That salvation was in Christ and in Christ alone.
[time=2900] One of the greatest theologians of the Roman Catholic church, Saina Geston, came to Christ by faith and his life was miraculously transformed.
[time=2909] This is not a Baptist religion.
[time=2911] We haven't said one thing this morning that's not a part of the Apostles Creed, which many of you say in your church is week after week.
[time=2919] Pilate said, "It's a religious question, and I don't dabble in religion." But the issue of Jesus Christ is the greatest question of life, and you cannot avoid it as being a religious question.
[time=2933] What would you do with Jesus?
[time=2935] Would you try to say he's too insignificant?
[time=2938] Life has too much stress, too much pressure for you to focus in on Jesus.
[time=2944] Would you say that he's someone else's problem?
[time=2948] It's not my decision to make.
[time=2950] Or would you say that's a religious question?
[time=2953] And I don't argue about religion and politics.
[time=2956] I go to a different church, and this sounds awful, Baptist-ish to me.
[time=2961] But you try to ignore it because it's not part of your background, not part of your home religion.
[time=2969] But the Jews kept pressing on.
[time=2971] They kept demanding the Pilate triumph.
[time=2973] So finally, Pilate comes and makes it a matter of public appeal.
[time=2979] Luke 23, verse 13.
[time=2983] And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
[time=2990] said unto them, "You have brought this man unto me as one that perverted the people,
[time=2997] and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man,
[time=3005] touching the things of which you accused him." No, nor yet Herod, for I sent you to him and lo, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
[time=3019] I will therefore chastise him and release him.
[time=3025] For of necessity, Pilate must release one unto them at the feast.
[time=3030] And they cried out all at once, saying away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas,
[time=3038] who, for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder, was cast in the prison.
[time=3044] Pilate, therefore willing to release Jesus, spoke again a second time to them, and they cried, saying, "Crucify him, crucify him." And when he said unto them, "The third time, why, what evil hath he done, I have found no cause of death in him, I will therefore chastise him and let him go."
[time=3067] And they were urgent with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified, and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
[time=3076] And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
[time=3082] Pilate tried to dismiss him, he looked at Jesus, he said, "Oh, he's true and significant,
[time=3089] I don't find any fault in him, release him." And the Jews said, "Oh no, we want to put him to death." And Pilate said, "Fine, take him to Herod, he's Herod's problem." And Herod sent him back.
[time=3102] And he said, "Well, it's a Jewish matter, you decide." And they said, "You decide." And he finally said, "I'll turn it to the people." Every year, they released one prisoner.
[time=3113] And Pilate was certain that if he just made it a matter of popularity, that the people would decide and he wouldn't have to make any decision.
[time=3121] Amazing thing is that the people decided for Barabbas.
[time=3127] Pilate was listening to the crowd and he was hoping the crowd would give him the answer he wanted.
[time=3132] He wanted to release Jesus, he wanted to send him away.
[time=3136] But the crowd called for Barabbas.
[time=3139] You know, I observe that there are many people today that want the crowd to make their decision about Christ.
[time=3145] They want to do what they hear people are doing.
[time=3149] My friend, if you'll listen for voices today, you won't hear many voices calling the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3156] You'll hear the voice of materialism.
[time=3158] You'll hear the voice that says, "You've only got one life.
[time=3162] Accomplish what you can. Gain what you can. You can't take it with you. Get it now." Materialism. It's the philosophy of life in this country.
[time=3171] You'll hear that voice. Not the voice calling for Jesus.
[time=3175] You may hear the voice of complacency.
[time=3178] Someone asked the question, "What is the greatest problem in America?" Apathy are indifference and the answer came back, "I don't know and I don't care."
[time=3188] Complacency. If you listen to voices today, you'll hear the voice of complacency saying, "Oh, it's no big deal.
[time=3195] You know, I don't want to be a religious fanatic." I heard a good definition of religious fanatic.
[time=3202] A religious fanatic is anyone who loves Jesus more than you do.
[time=3209] Anyone who loves Jesus more than you do.
[time=3212] And if you listen for voices, they'll tell you, "Oh, don't be a Jesus freak. Don't be a Baptist."
[time=3218] Just kind of stand complacent in the middle. That's the voice you'll hear.
[time=3223] Or you'll hear the voice of sex. Every time you open a magazine, sex will be the medium of sales.
[time=3229] Every time you turn on television, sex will be the language that is spoken.
[time=3233] And the commercial will tell you, "Only go around once. Grab for all the gusto you can." If you listen for voices today, you'll hear the drumbeat of sex far louder than the drumbeat saying, "Obey Jesus Christ."
[time=3248] Homer, in writing the Great Epic, the Iliad and the Odysseus, takes the hero Odysseus, Ulysses,
[time=3257] and he has him working his way back from the Trojan War to his home.
[time=3263] And there's an entrapment that comes. It's called the sirens, that enticing, wooing noise
[time=3269] that calls a man away from his destiny and bids him come to the seductive voices of the sirens.
[time=3277] And Homer was writing about the seduction of life that you can be seduced and drawn away when you listen to voices.
[time=3286] This morning, would you listen to the voice that calls for Jesus Christ? Pilot began to listen to the voices,
[time=3293] and he thought for sure that the popularity of the people would make the decision for him.
[time=3299] He desperately did not want to release Christ. Within the count of Luke four times,
[time=3305] Pilot said, "We found no fault in him. He's innocent. Let me release him." And continually, the people said, "Give us Barabbas. Place yourself 2,000 years ago.
[time=3319] You're in a great crowd of people. You're gathered outside the palace of Pontius Pilate.
[time=3325] And they're giving a choice. Jesus or Barabbas, whose name would you yell?
[time=3332] You know, there's an amazing amount of similarities between these two men, Jesus and Barabbas.
[time=3339] One is this. You have to choose one or the other." A strange thing we discover is that Barabbas was a name given to him, and his real name was Jesus.
[time=3354] Origin, a church historian of the second century, traces back and points out that both men on trial that day had the name of Jesus.
[time=3365] Amazing similarities, but there were differences.
[time=3369] One man came and said, "I'm come that you might have life, that you might have it more abundantly." The other one came and was a murderer and an insurrectionist.
[time=3379] One came preaching the kingdom of God of love. The other came of war and strife.
[time=3386] And each of these men represent an answer to a problem.
[time=3389] Barabbas said, "I've got the answer. Overthrow the Romans." And Jesus said, "I've got the answer. Believe on me, and you'll have life everlasting."
[time=3400] And what faced that angry mob that day was a choice?
[time=3404] Will they accept God's provision for life? Or will they accept man's provision?
[time=3409] Barnabas says, "I'll live my life. I'll do it my way." Jesus said, "Do it my way." And the great choice in life is what will you do?
[time=3419] Will you accept Jesus Christ and invite him into your heart?
[time=3422] Will you receive him as Savior by faith?
[time=3425] Will you bow your heart in prayer and say, "Jesus, I know I'm a sinner, and I surrender my heart to you.
[time=3431] I invite you by faith to come into my heart." Would you receive him this morning?
[time=3436] Or would you say, "No, it's my life. Give me Barabbas. Let me grab my own life.
[time=3443] Let me shake my own destiny. It's my thing. I'll do what I will do.
[time=3447] Don't talk to me about surrender. You and I must make the choice.
[time=3452] What will we do with Jesus Christ? There's no neutrality.
[time=3455] Will you accept him, or will you reject him?" You've been sharing the Bible hour.
