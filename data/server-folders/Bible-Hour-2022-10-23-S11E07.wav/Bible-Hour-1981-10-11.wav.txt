[time=30] That her of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible
[time=46] Hour. Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=76] Good morning and we welcome you to our morning worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=84] Church. We're thrilled today that you've come to worship with us. We want to say a special word of welcome to our television audience, the Bible Hour, and tell you that we're delighted that you're joining with us, that we might worship God this morning. We have as our special guest Dr. Wilbert Welsh. Dr. Welsh is the president of Grand Rapids Baptist College
[time=105] and Seminary. He's been here to speak before and we're so much looking forward to his message today. But right now we're going to hear a great anthem of praise from our choir
[time=117] under the direction of Don Kruger and they're going to sing for us. Now let us all praise God and sing the sanctuary choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=147] We pray that we may hold with one at four in our joyful voices praise.
[time=161] Sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah.
[time=224] Now let us all praise God and sing our great Redeemers praise.
[time=235] And we may hold with one at four in our joyful voices praise.
[time=244] Sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah.
[time=254] Sing Hallelujah.
[time=268] Thank you choir. That was a delightful anthem of praise. We're so thankful for the ministry of music that we have here. As I mentioned earlier, we have Dr. Welsh with us as our pulpit guests. Welcome today, Dr. Welsh. We were talking backstage, and I mistakenly
[time=284] said he is the president of Grand Rapids Baptist Bible College and Seminary, and Grand Rapids
[time=290] is not a Bible college, is it? No, it is not. It has a history of starting off as an institute. And oftentimes, like in Baptist circles, they did not know where they were going when they started. And so it became then a Bible college and eventually
[time=305] moved into a full liberal arts Christian college. And that's an important distinction to know.
[time=311] There's a difference between a Bible college and a Christian liberal arts school. Now Grand Rapids is definitely a Bible oriented school. How many hours of Bible is available at that school? 89 hours in the college plus what they could obtain in the Seminary Division, a graduate school. So beyond that, I think we have 17 majors that go beyond the Bible
[time=332] major and about 23 minors. That's an extensive program. That's what we mean by liberal arts
[time=338] college. They have a tremendous Bible department that's the foundation for all studies and then a great number of other majors. We're so thankful you're with us today. I had an opportunity at being at Grand Rapids, and it's a school designed for me in their Seminary building. They have a swimming pool. Now that's unique. That swimming pool, we never would
[time=358] have a swimming pool in a Baptist Seminary. That happens to be an enlarged baptismal pool. Right. And the large baptismal pool. They're ministering to the total man there.
[time=369] Right. It's a tremendous thing. We have to train the seminarians how to do it and that's a good place. Oh good. I knew I went to the wrong school. You knew that too, did you?
[time=378] Oh yes, I did. Well that's a delightful school to be at and I've had several opportunities to visit there. And a delight to be here this morning too. But by the way, is there anything you can do about this Coliseum Drive so man can get here when he thinks he's going to get here? That is a problem. We have a boulevard through town called Coliseum Boulevard, which is the world's longest, most narrow parking lot. I thought as I went down the thing that maybe we ought to take up an offering to help them with their light system. I'm sure the city fathers would appreciate that. We were talking this morning that all of us were looking
[time=411] forward to his coming and when he wasn't here at a quarter after for the first service, I was looking forward to his coming a lot more than others because I know on your shoulder that duty would fall at that time. Earlier you shared that you've just come back from the mission field. Could you tell us a little bit about that?
[time=427] Well yes, about four and a half years ago, Mrs. Welch and I had said we would like to visit mission fields in a ministry, not as a visitor, not as a camera clicker. And we had the opportunity
[time=438] of visiting 37 mission fields in three different periods of time covering about 300 or rather
[time=444] about 170 days altogether. Our last one was in South America and we were there with about
[time=451] 200 missionaries in their own fields coming together for seminars. I think we spoke in
[time=459] 52 days 170 times.
[time=461] Wow, that's a workout.
[time=464] We have tremendous excitement about missions right now in our church because we have several young couples heading out to the mission field along with several individual single people who are going out to serve Christ. Could you just share with us for a moment the title of your message and what we should be looking forward to hearing and the rest of the service?
[time=482] Yes, yes, happy to from 2 Peter 1-3. You can be memorizing that a little right now. I'll
[time=488] be asking you to do it 2 Peter 1-3 on God's provision for rich Christian living.
[time=492] Great, thank you Dr. Wells for sharing with us and we're looking forward to your message.
[time=497] Now we're going to hear from Keith Brodygan who is in no way a stranger to us and he's not a stranger to Dr. Welsh either because Keith Brodygan attended Grand Rapids Baptist
[time=508] College and he is a gifted musician who's turned his talent over to the Lord and he's going to sing for us now. Mr. Keith Brodygan.
[time=532] [MUSIC - 234 seconds]
[time=790] Hello, I've been looking forward to this time of sharing with you the Ministry of the Black
[time=797] Hawk Baptist Church through the Bible Hour. I have with me this morning my friend Don Kruger
[time=803] our Minister of Music and we have several bits of information we'd like to share with you
[time=809] this morning. The first thing I would like to share with you is a letter that we have received from one of our Founders Club members. Your letters are a great encouragement to us in these days and one viewer writes and has said this I have been praying during the transition of pastors
[time=825] at the Black Hawk Church. You have my support in daily prayers. I am on a limited income but I am
[time=833] faithful in my support of the Founders Club. May God bless you in your ministry. This letter was
[time=840] a tremendous encouragement to us to know that this friend is praying for us and also being faithful
[time=847] and helping support the Founders Club. We so much appreciate your gifts. We love to share the ministry
[time=854] of God's Word with you and the special music that we have each week. But all of that is dependent
[time=860] upon the faithfulness of people helping to support this ministry. Pastor Rick I don't know if everybody
[time=866] is aware of the fact that the Bible Hour supported almost completely by the Founders Club. Our church
[time=874] supports it some but we are very very dependent on those who are in the Founders Club to help us in this ministry. Without you this ministry really cannot go on. So we certainly appreciate your support and your faithfulness and thank you so much for this letter. That is such an encouragement to us. It really is and we want to take this time just to say a special thank you to you for supporting
[time=896] us in your prayers and financially. It is not possible to be with you today through this ministry of
[time=902] television if it were not for your loving compassionate gifts and prayers. And as a way of saying thank
[time=910] you we have something we'd like to offer you. We shared it with you in the past. It's a booklet entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking. A few weeks ago you met our friend Ken Nichols. He is a
[time=921] psychologist on our staff. He is a man who has gifted an area of counseling and he has a booklet
[time=927] that he's written entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking. And I want to ask Don Kruger if he would share with you a little bit about the book that Ken has written. Pastor Rick this is a tremendous little booklet Remedies for Negative Thinking that is very practical and very biblical and it tells
[time=943] how that we can have victory over the problems of negative thinking. We all have thoughts that are negative at times. I have thoughts that I am not very happy with negative thoughts
[time=954] but a person who constantly thinks negative is a person who is overcome and obsessed with these
[time=961] thoughts. And to that type of person Dr. Ken in particular writes this book Remedies for Negative
[time=967] Thinking. For instance under the topic overcoming the conflict he shares with us the fact that every
[time=973] thought should be brought into captivity and that's a scriptural principle. The Bible is our first step
[time=979] in overcoming negative thinking and then talking with God or prayer. A very very practical little
[time=985] book that we want to share with you on Remedies for Negative Thinking. If you'd like one of these books send to us here at the Bible Hour box 15000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and we will send
[time=1000] this book to you. Make sure you write today for Remedies for Negative Thinking. The Bible Hour box
[time=1007] 15000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815. Don today we have a special guest in the pulpit here at the Black
[time=1016] Hawk Baptist Church Dr. Wilbert Welsh. Dr. Welsh was been on our broadcast just a few minutes ago
[time=1024] as you got to meet him when I interviewed him and he gave you some information about the school.
[time=1030] Grand Rapids Baptist Bible College in seminary where he's the president. Dr. Welsh is a capable
[time=1036] communicator and excellent preacher and I know you're going to be encouraged by his message today and we just want to ask you to be a faithful viewer of the Bible Hour and perhaps invite a
[time=1047] friend into your home and share the ministry of God's Word with them. I'm looking forward to Dr.
[time=1053] Welsh's message in just a few minutes but again let me encourage you to write today to the Bible
[time=1059] Hour box 15000 Fort Wayne Indiana zip code 46815. We would love to hear from you and we would also
[time=1068] like to send you Dr. Ken's book entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking. God bless you.
[time=1089] My past with its sin and sin. My guilt and despair. Jesus stood on him there
[time=1117] and calvary covers it all. Our nearer than all that the world can impart is the message that came
[time=1141] to my heart how that Jesus alone born I sinned in a door and calvary covers it all.
[time=1166] How blessed the fall that is sold by him God shall be hid in a glory on high where we're gladness
[time=1188] and strong I'll be one of the strong and calvary covers it all.
[time=1206] Calvary covers it all. My past with its sin and sin. My guilt and despair. Jesus stood on him
[time=1231] there and calvary covers it all. My guilt and despair. Jesus stood on him there
[time=1255] and calvary covers it all.
[time=1284] Thank you black hawk singers for sharing with us through music the sufficiency of Jesus Christ
[time=1290] that he covers every one of our sins and washes them all the way calvary covers it all. It was about
[time=1299] three years ago at this time at least three years ago this week that George and Mary Lantman began
[time=1305] a ministry here entitled super 60s and I'd like to ask George and Mary if they'd come up to the
[time=1311] platform and join me at this time. Three years ago they began a ministry to senior citizens senior
[time=1318] adults here in the Fort Wayne area. I believe on that first occasion you had 34 people is that correct
[time=1325] 34 people and over the time that they've been here in three years God has blessed their ministry
[time=1332] of sharing the gospel and a word of encouragement and a fellowship time with senior adults that on their third anniversary they trusted God for 350 people. That seemed like a great venture of faith
[time=1344] to me because they'd never had 300 people before but God so blessed their ministry that this Friday
[time=1350] we had over 430 senior adults with us on Friday morning in the ministry of super 60s one of the
[time=1360] great ministries of our church that touches people lonely people sometimes people don't have anyone
[time=1366] else except for the Lord Jesus Christ they now have two choice servants George and Mary Lantman who
[time=1372] love them and care for them and we are so thrilled at the way God has blessed their ministry and we want to honor you today with the thanks of our hearts and say God bless you and thank you for
[time=1383] not retiring from the Lord's work George and Mary Lantman thank you. Thank you.
[time=1396] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1420] Thank you. We love all of you and I want to make it public that we praise God for what he did. It's
[time=1426] not us it's him. He says call upon me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things.
[time=1433] I had little faith that we set up for 360 and God gave us 434 and so he did that and I want to
[time=1440] thank him I want to thank my wife for what she does and all of those who help us they made it all
[time=1446] possible and thank you because we love each one of you. Thank you God bless you. It really takes
[time=1454] a special wife who likes to make baloney salad sandwiches for 435 people. God gave George just
[time=1463] the right help mate for that and Mary. We're so thankful for their ministry and our church and
[time=1469] George is a retired naval officer but he's not retired from serving Jesus Christ our lives belong
[time=1475] to him and Jesus should be the Lord of all and so Allen Lenna Peterson come to sing for us now
[time=1481] Jesus be the Lord of all. It's the theme for these next days as we enter into a special time in the
[time=1488] ministry of our church that Jesus be the Lord of every area of our life. Someone said if Jesus
[time=1495] is not Lord of all he's not Lord at all. They've come to sing for us today in the ministry of music
[time=1502] Jesus be the Lord of all.
[time=1532] In my heart are kingdoms of a world that's of my own kingdoms that are only seen by myself
[time=1554] and God alone in the past where I try to hold my world. It just seemed to fall apart so please
[time=1572] Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingdoms of my heart. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all.
[time=1598] Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingdoms of my heart.
[time=1611] Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all.
[time=1624] Jesus be the Lord of all.
[time=1646] I guess I only fooled myself when I said I had healed and all for in a secret corner of my heart
[time=1662] was a kingdom that did not fall. I surrender now make my heart hearth through all the ruins
[time=1676] of kingdoms both great and small for if you're the Lord of everything then you're not Lord at all.
[time=1694] Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all.
[time=1740] Jesus be the Lord of all. Jesus be the Lord of all. The kingdoms of my heart.
[time=1767] Amen. May it always be so that Jesus is the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart. Dr. Welsh needs no
[time=1777] other introduction as you've met him this morning as we had a chance to interview him. We're so thankful for his coming and ask God's richest blessing on your ministry with us today. Thank you Dr. Welsh
[time=1788] for coming. I appreciate the opportunity of being with you friends and to share with you the wonderful
[time=1797] Word of God. We've been in Fort Wayne many many times ministering in the many churches of this
[time=1804] area and so we've become acquainted with a little bit of the outreach of this church that God has so wonderfully wonderfully blessed and I'm glad to be a part of it today with you.
[time=1814] We want the Word of God the precious Word of God to have a central part in the service
[time=1821] and so would you open your Bibles with me to second Peter the first chapter. Second Peter the first
[time=1828] chapter. While verse three will be our text to which we will come in a moment I'd like for you to
[time=1836] have the setting of verse three in these first 11 verses of this first chapter. Simon Peter
[time=1846] a servant in an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith and I may
[time=1853] comment as I go along he's talking to believers that is those who have placed their faith in Jesus
[time=1860] Christ and faith is called precious because of what it will do for us and the relationship it gives
[time=1867] us to the Lord who have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God.
[time=1874] And again he reminds us it's not our righteousness but a righteousness which we gain when we trust Christ of God and our Savior Jesus Christ. Verse two grace and peace be multiplied onto you
[time=1886] not added but grace and peace be multiplied through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[time=1893] And if you want grace and peace to be multiplied in your life he tells us the means the modus operandi
[time=1900] that it comes through knowledge but a very special knowledge the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[time=1906] Lord. The text according is his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life
[time=1913] and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to and I would retranslate this a little
[time=1920] to his glory and his excellence by which that is his glory and excellence by which are given
[time=1928] unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine
[time=1934] nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and now he gives a word of
[time=1941] admonition and beside this that is beside the matter of what we have in Christ and these wonderful
[time=1947] provisions and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge
[time=1956] and to knowledge self-control and to self-control patience and to patience godliness maybe ought to stop and say that no one becomes holy in a hurry you'll notice the progressiveness
[time=1970] of this add add add and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[time=1979] kindness love for of these things these attitudes these graces if these things be in you and abounds
[time=1987] they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[time=1993] Christ on the other hand but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see a far off
[time=1999] and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins a word of admonition then from Peter to the
[time=2005] readers of his epistle where for the rather brethren give diligence in verse five giving all diligence
[time=2013] add add add and in verse 10 give diligence to make your calling and election sure
[time=2021] for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior Jesus Christ
[time=2033] God never intended his children to be victims of Satan's strategies and he has strategies he never intended that those of us who are called by his name and we're in the wonderful family of
[time=2045] god he never intended that we should be depressed too often we are never intended that we should be
[time=2052] defeated too often we are never intended that we should be full of doubts and too often we are
[time=2061] he never intended that we should have no joy in our sonship he wants us to have that emotional
[time=2067] tone of warmth and vibrancy the joy of the lord is our portion too often we do not have it
[time=2074] he never intended us to be without the peace of god he said at his heritage when he couldn't give us stocks and bonds and securities and the clipping of coupons as dividends
[time=2086] he could not give us houses and lands but he said I can give you something my peace I give unto you it would be wonderful as believers as part of god's family we always
[time=2098] displayed the peace of god that passed with all understanding and he never intended that our
[time=2104] home should be destroyed that was never god's intent that there should be disruption disharmony
[time=2111] in the breaking up of homes but it's happening all over america and around the world he never intended that there should be the lowering of standards of spiritual conduct as a president of
[time=2122] a christian college and a seminary with a great many students coming to us every year
[time=2128] one thing seems to be coming through clearly to me over the last 22 years of my presidency there
[time=2136] and that is little by little there is the erosion of high biblical standards and they come to us
[time=2144] wondering oftentimes how much can I do and still be called a christian but rather and rather not
[time=2152] what can I leave out of my life to be a better christian i'm rather appalled at that and god never intended this he made ample provision for us if you'll remember from david's writings
[time=2165] and everyone here and in our audience would know the 23rd Psalm or some portion of it probably the one chapter that more people know than any other chapter in all of god's word
[time=2176] the lord is my shepherd but move down through that till you come to verse six the last verse
[time=2183] and he says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
[time=2190] and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever look at the confidence there and the blessedness of this man of god starting where we have to start if we don't start there the lord is my shepherd we can't end up at the end where it says surely goodness and mercy so follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever that's his confidence paul had the same confidence he said there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus verse one of roman's eight and you move through the 39 verses and you
[time=2221] come to the last verse well verse 37 it starts but he says what shall separate us from the love of god tribulation distress persecutions and he ends up by saying i am persuaded that nothing can
[time=2233] separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and i've mentioned this that's standard but our practice somehow does not come up to the standard i remember one time hearing
[time=2246] a man tell he didn't quite know what to give one who'd serviced him a little bit and he said by the way what's the average tip and the man replied immediately the average tip is one dollar and he handed him a dollar and he looked up at him surprised that you are the first man that ever came up to the average well i wonder here if we don't have sometimes that we're way below the
[time=2267] average david is saying there's a confidence paul is saying there's a confidence in the provisions
[time=2274] of god and we have not brought our practice up to the average there's a premise then that i would
[time=2281] see here if we look at the overall perspective a premise is this that god never asked me to be
[time=2290] anything or to do anything but with that request makes it possible for me to be and do that what he
[time=2301] has asked i heard dr. robert thomas ketchum say that in my church where i passed it i would
[time=2309] assume that was about 30 years ago and it stuck with me i wrote it down in my own words it's not
[time=2315] exact it's a little paraphrase but the premise is simply this god will never ask me to be anything
[time=2321] or to do anything but with that request he will make it possible for me to be or to do that very
[time=2329] thing you see god does not tantalizingly tease us with goals and objectives which cannot be obtained
[time=2336] it doesn't dangle something out in front of us for which we we can ever week to which we can ever attain then someone may ask well if that is true and it is true if that's the if that's the premise
[time=2349] and it's a true premise then what's the the problem if the if the provisions are there and the provisions
[time=2356] of god are there abundant provisions then why the failure and i think we can give you
[time=2362] at least a resemblance of an answer on that one of the reasons may well be that we are ignorant
[time=2370] of the provisions did you notice in verse two through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
[time=2379] did you notice in verse three through the knowledge of him that have called us dear friends i must know about my provisions before i can ever call upon them
[time=2390] to illustrate it let me just draw out of our own home life
[time=2396] mrs. Welch is here with me this morning let me say that in grand rapids we have
[time=2404] a certain arrangement it's not the best arrangement there must be something better
[time=2410] but it's our own particular arrangement the arrangement is simply this i put money in the bank and she takes it out evidently there's a little bit of relating to this here i noticed one man just felt to see if his rib was cracked
[time=2429] in the uh but what really bothers me about the arrangement is that she's better at her work
[time=2436] than i am in mind and for the illustration just suppose we come to the end of near the end of the
[time=2444] month and i'm sitting down reading a paper enjoying it when she says from the little desk which is
[time=2451] hers Wilbert do you know how much we owe this month well i don't know i've turned that over to her
[time=2459] and frankly i don't want to know i like to have peace of heart you know i don't want to know
[time=2465] and she tells me anyway it's very difficult to enjoy your paper after that
[time=2471] then she says and i know the second question is coming then she says just like the second she was
[time=2478] going to drop uh Wilbert do you know how much we have in the bank having heard the answer to the
[time=2485] first question i really don't want to hear the answer to the second question i'm suspicious but she tells me you don't enjoy anything after that by and by you get up and sit down with her and try to figure out which one can be delayed to the
[time=2502] 15th i'm sure you and the affluent fort Wayne area never have any problems like that we do
[time=2509] now area now again let us suppose that some wealthy philanthropist who knows what we are doing
[time=2515] goes down to old Kent Bank and says to the teller there i know Dr. Welch and i don't want him to have
[time=2524] any financial worries anxieties i want that that there should be ample supply and so he says to the
[time=2532] teller i'd like to deposit to the account of W. Wilbert and Merle E. Welch the sum of one million
[time=2539] dollars i wish someone would one time but let's just you know it's an illustration you understand
[time=2548] the reality and the illustration are not related um but then he deposits one million dollars it's
[time=2556] over with the transaction is completed it's a fact dear friends unless we become informed
[time=2564] of that deposit to our account we will operate at the end of every month with all the anxieties
[time=2571] and the concerns as though it were not there you follow that do you not you see i can come to
[time=2578] the needs of the hour and said oh if i just had this if i just had that i could do it when actually
[time=2585] there is a million dollars to my account but unless i am informed of that i cannot act upon it
[time=2591] and it may very well be that in the wonderful grace of god we have had ample provision made for
[time=2599] us in heaven's deposit charged to our account but unless i am informed of it i will act with all
[time=2607] the anxieties the concerns the doubts the loss of joy the loss of peace as though the deposit had
[time=2613] never been made well i want us this morning in the time we have to examine just a little of
[time=2619] what god has done for us one reason may be as we have said my ignorance the second reason may be
[time=2627] i know but i do not exercise the faith to drop on it and the third reason may be even more serious
[time=2634] than that that i know i'd like to drop on it but there is an attitude within me or there is a style
[time=2642] of life so in contradiction to the will of god that he cannot bless me as he would like to
[time=2650] less in so doing he tacitly approved what he cannot approve did that come out too long
[time=2659] could i pick it up and just drop it back to a three grooves you know i said that one time in
[time=2668] the chapel and some young man came up to me afterwards and said dr welch how many grooves are there
[time=2675] in a record i mean i won't son i never thought about i don't know he said there's only one groove
[time=2686] it's a long one i hate brilliant students like that
[time=2696] so could i just pick it up and drop it back and eat of an inch in there and say this the third reason
[time=2702] may be that god cannot bless us like he would like to bless us because there may be attitudes
[time=2710] dispositions or actions within us so contradictory to his design and plan and will that for him to
[time=2717] richly bless us would be tacitly saying i approve what you're doing such as maybe you sometime have
[time=2724] wanted to give a tricycle to your little child but just before you make the presentation there is there is an act of knotting us and you say oh i can't do it now it's a long time
[time=2734] and it may be that god is handicapped if i may put it that way in reaching his children because
[time=2742] of us now let's look at the provisions here and note first of all in the text of verse three the
[time=2748] resource of the provision the resource of the provision according as his divine power
[time=2755] i trust we do not question the resource here and the adequacy of it the fullness or the
[time=2763] sufficiency of god's power to provide we only need look about us and see the adequacy of his power
[time=2772] the god of creation these jewies people when they wrote about their god they they had a concept
[time=2779] of a tremendous god the heavens declare the glory of god the firm that show with his handiwork
[time=2785] are you aware today i'm i'm sure you read just as i do you know this that out in the galaxies of
[time=2793] space there are stars now we think that we're something here we're eight thousand miles through 25,000 miles around and there's a moment out there about oh what is it around 200,000 miles away
[time=2807] it takes about two and a half seconds i think for round trip on on the light and there's a sun
[time=2813] out there 93 approximately million miles away takes the light eight minutes to get here 186,000
[time=2821] miles a second are you aware that there are stars out there that could be placed in between
[time=2829] this earth the circumference of this earth and it reached all the way to the sun 93 million miles
[time=2835] in diameter who made all of that and when we behold the the greatness of his creative acts
[time=2842] we ought to raise the question who am i to ever doubt the sufficiency of god's power
[time=2851] now let's move from that what has that power done and i look at the second
[time=2857] item here in the text not just the resource of the provision but what has the provider done
[time=2863] and i noticed in the action of the provision according to his divine power half given
[time=2869] half given uh the english language does not always faithfully convey what the original language
[time=2879] does here this happens to be a perfect participle we would maybe use the past tense and say god gave
[time=2889] but it doesn't say that god has given god hath given the old king james god hath given
[time=2895] now what's the difference in here well one has a continuous action maybe can be demonstrated in
[time=2901] this way i oh not often but i have gone out to hunt and i get out there and i can't find anything
[time=2910] i come back and maybe in a moment of disgust that i have spent those hours and not anything
[time=2918] visible and by and by i take my nice gun and aim it up at a knot in a tree and pull the trigger and
[time=2924] the bang is and i've had some satisfaction at least i shot the gun and my wife says to me as i come in what did you get anything that's a stupid question i mean if i had anything you wouldn't need to ask i'd be dangling it holy of luck out hey it's like when you go fishing do you ever have your wife ask you did you catch anything if i catch anything i blew the horn a block down the road
[time=2948] if i don't catch anything i shut the motor off a block down the road sneak in sneak back out did you get anything i said no but i shot the gun and i mean by that past tense
[time=2961] it's over with ah but i come home some afternoon and i sit down in the chair and
[time=2968] i'm reading away enjoying daguard and landers sylvia porter hallowese
[time=2978] you don't have a probably in this wonderful spiritual church you don't even read the funny
[time=2985] paper once i know i can't stand people who don't read funny papers
[time=2992] they upset me they make me feel miserable i read everything there are things i don't like
[time=2998] but i read it to see why i don't like it so i'm reading away and she says to me wilbert
[time=3004] how would you like in fact if it's very she says honey how would you like to turn on the holes
[time=3010] what a question i'm an honest man like saying how would you like to carry out the garbage
[time=3018] well i just love it no not at all right i'd like to say no i don't want to it rather stay here but
[time=3025] when i consider the alternatives i yes i'd be delighted to let me just finish this paragraph
[time=3034] and i finish it and i go out and turn on the holes she's a good administrator and a few minutes later
[time=3040] just before the evening music oh did you turn on the holes now listen i say yes i have turned on
[time=3049] the holes but i mean something by that that what i did that can be pinpointed in a moment's time i
[time=3056] went out and did something that the results of my having done that continue to flow to this present moment you with me on that now and that's what this present participle verb means here in this
[time=3068] language god hath given and god in history through the person of jesus christ did something for me
[time=3076] that brings a provision in my behalf that flows and flows and flows to the present hour
[time=3082] and it has never diminished and if i walk away with an empty teacup it isn't because the provision
[time=3090] is not flowing he turned it on at calvary so that our needs can be met now that's the action of the provision you see dear friends we are theist not deist
[time=3106] a deist is one that says god created an established natural and operational laws and then went off
[time=3114] and left it we are theist we believe in a god who not only was active then but is active today in his
[time=3121] creation and especially active in behalf of his own who are in the family of god we are his we're
[time=3129] prone to forget oh how prone we are to forget well here is the greatness of god's action toward me
[time=3138] half given and i need to note the extent of the provisions all things all things god hath given
[time=3146] according as his divine power hath given i could say notice the recipients unto us
[time=3153] put your name in there this morning put my name in there this morning have given on to us
[time=3160] not someone else we are the recipients of the action of god in that abundant provision
[time=3166] and given unto us but now i want us to note the extent of the provision that is all things all things god's provisions far exceed our needs
[time=3178] just as the provision of an ocean far exceeds the needs of a teacup can you imagine putting all of
[time=3187] our needs together today going out to the ocean the pacific or the atlantic and standing at the shore
[time=3196] and being timid unitedly to dip in our teacups to have our needs met less in some way we exhaust
[time=3204] the resources of the pacific put all your needs put all your needs to gather one great bundle
[time=3210] and let god meet those needs immediately and there would be no less supply of resource
[time=3218] all things all things i've been discovering through my life how great those all things are
[time=3227] i've never yet i haven't come to the end i've been walking with the lord now and
[time=3234] sometimes more closely than others since 16 years of age i have not exhausted them i remember the
[time=3244] night i was saved i knew just a little bit about what god had forgiveness then that night i was born again but i didn't know his provisions for me back a few years ago about 40 years ago right now one day mrs welch asked me to marry her
[time=3262] well that's my story that's my version if she were telling it she would have some perversion i'm
[time=3272] sure you know uh and we talked about it for a while i finally gave in
[time=3278] and we stood in front of a minister and he said will found he said i will said to me will
[time=3285] down i said i would then he said something like this i now by the authority invested in me
[time=3291] as a minister and a representative of the state pronounce you husband and wife not man and wife
[time=3297] if a man isn't a man by then it's too late never i could understand why the manuals marriage man is always a man and wife i mean no preacher has a capacity of making the man a man if he's not already a man i pronounce you husband and wife the name of the father of the son or
[time=3313] the holy ghost amen and i knew in that hour as we walked out of that church i knew i had a wife
[time=3319] but i did not know what a wife i had don't we smile about it but wait you went through that you see it's taken these 40 years 39 years and
[time=3331] coming up 40 it's taken all of these years of walking together working together and laughing together and crying together it's taken this time of standing by a bedside praying hand in hand
[time=3343] for god to spare a sick loved one in our own particular case as with many of you there's that
[time=3349] time when you walk out to a cemetery and place there one of your own body but in all of this you
[time=3356] were not learning that you had a wife you were learning what a wife you had the supplement the
[time=3362] compliment of all that you need when i walked down those tall steps from that country church
[time=3369] that sunday night i knew i had a savior but i didn't know what a savior i had i wish i could get that across it's taken all these years of serving him and walking with him
[time=3381] to discover a little bit about his greatness and so i see here something of the extent of his provisions and the provisions are public he said he's such a table before in the presence of mine
[time=3392] enemies why would god place our table out in front of the enemies i'll tell you why he wants
[time=3398] those who are on the outside as he wonder what wonderful things we have who are on the inside so he makes it public right out there and he wants them to see the grace we have and the
[time=3408] patience we have and the joy we have and the love we have he wants all of that to be seen
[time=3414] so those are the all things what about the reality of your christianity today
[time=3420] then would you note if you're just taking a little note on that the scope of the provisions all things for life and godliness life and everything we need in this life and all that we need for
[time=3432] our godliness and then i think you must close it out by noting the channel the channel through
[time=3439] the knowledge and we need to know him today if we do not know jesus christ we're not on the right
[time=3446] foundation but if we know jesus christ it's a greater knowledge of him that brings us into
[time=3452] contact with the wonderful provisions of god shall we pray together
[time=3459] and we would ask our friend you've been sharing the bible hour if as a result of this program you have made a decision about
