[time=20] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=28] [singing]
[time=49] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=54] We want to welcome you this morning to our second worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and say a special hello to our television family who are joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=66] We're looking forward to this opportunity today to study God's Word together, to sing praises, and to hear special songs that will minister to our hearts.
[time=76] Today we're going to hear from star in our world, strictly feminine, and the men singers, but right now, our choir is going to sing a song for us entitled "Redeemed", and that is a great hymn reminding us that Jesus Christ has forgiven our sins.
[time=90] He has redeemed us from the slave market of sin, the choir singing redeemed under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=98] [MUSIC]
[time=107] [singing]
[time=136] Redeemed and so happy in Jesus' full language, my rapture can tell.
[time=146] I know that no light of His presence would lead us continually well.
[time=153] Redeemed, redeemed from the blood of the land.
[time=160] Redeemed through His infinite mercy, His joy, and forever I am.
[time=168] [MUSIC]
[time=173] I know I shall see in His beauty the King in blue's mighty mind.
[time=190] [singing]
[time=200] Redeemed, redeemed from the blood of the land.
[time=207] [singing]
[time=225] That is a great anthem of praise, and if you're like me, you found yourself singing along with the choir.
[time=232] Now, the choir doesn't appreciate that when I sing along, but I enjoy it, and that is a great reminder that Jesus Christ has forgiven all of our sins, we've been redeemed.
[time=242] One of our favorite soloists here at the Bible Hour is Mr. Narwhal, soon to be Mrs. Keith Brodigan.
[time=249] We appreciate her ministry of music, and she comes to sing for us clean before my Lord, I stand.
[time=257] [MUSIC]
[time=264] Clean before my Lord, I stand, and in me, not one blemish does He see.
[time=278] When I placed all my burdens on Him, He washed them all from me.
[time=291] Oh, why did I wait so long to learn such a living song?
[time=306] And how could I stay so close without seeing Him? Never seeing Him?
[time=321] Clean before my Lord, I stand, and in me, not one blemish does He see.
[time=335] When I placed all my burdens on Him, He washed them all from me.
[time=348] So why do you wait so long to learn such a living song?
[time=362] And how can you stay so close without seeing Him? Never seeing Him?
[time=377] Clean before my Lord, I stand, and in me, not one blemish does He see.
[time=392] When I placed all my burdens on Him, He washed them all from me.
[time=405] He washed them all from me.
[time=418] [MUSIC]
[time=435] Good morning, Don, and good morning to you, our friends of the Bible Hour who have joined us today to worship together.
[time=442] We're so thankful that you're watching this program this morning that we can share a ministry of encouragement to your life.
[time=449] It really thrills my heart to hear the choirs they sing great hymns of praise to God.
[time=454] That does something for us personally, in our spiritual life.
[time=457] The psalmist said that it is good to praise God.
[time=461] And then also the special musicians who sing Star Narwhal has always been a favorite of mine.
[time=466] The clarity of her singing just really is refreshing, isn't it, Dar?
[time=471] And we're thankful that you've joined us today and are watching this telecast.
[time=475] And I'm looking forward to sharing with you a message from my heart from Philippians 1-21 where the Apostle Paul gave the code of his life when he said for me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[time=490] We want to communicate with you often, and we're thankful for this time in the middle of the telecast just to share with our friends and the television audience.
[time=499] But also this week, I wrote a letter to many of you, and perhaps some of you got it in the later days of this week, or you'll get it early next week.
[time=508] In that letter, I shared with you a little bit about the financial needs of the Bible Hour.
[time=513] Of all the things I could possibly talk about, the thing that I enjoyed the least is talking about money.
[time=520] You know, Don, talking about money is a little bit difficult because people don't often understand why television ministries have to ask for money.
[time=529] There have been people in the past who perhaps have broken trust in the way they've used money, and there are now agencies in our country that are looking into matters of how money is being raised and how it's being used.
[time=542] And we just want to take this time to explain a little bit to you about our financial position and how we raise the money needed for the Bible Hour.
[time=551] First of all, absolutely every penny that is given to this ministry goes right into the broadcasting of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=561] Money is not diverted from television into other special projects, whether it be at this church or anywhere else.
[time=569] Our finances come from two sources. First of all, the Founders Club, and those are the faithful loyal people who really make this ministry possible.
[time=578] Last week, we shared with you a letter about one individual who wrote just to encourage us that they were going to continue to give as a member of the Founders Club.
[time=588] The Founders Club pays for over half of the cost of producing and providing the Bible Hour to our television family.
[time=597] The other part of the financial need comes through special gifts.
[time=601] And so from time to time, we write to you the people who enjoy the Bible Hour and the people who God touches through the Bible Hour.
[time=610] We write to you to let you know of our financial need because it's from you that the other half of our financial support has to come.
[time=617] So we're asking you this week to be praying about how you might help the Bible Hour.
[time=622] It's our desire to share the Gospel with just as many people as God would give us opportunity.
[time=628] It's a biblical principle that funds and finances come from the people who are the beneficiaries of the ministry.
[time=637] So we're asking you to read that letter and to prayerfully consider what God would have you to do.
[time=643] We also want to share some information with you of some spiritual value.
[time=647] Over recent weeks, Don has been telling you a little bit about a booklet called "The Ready Reference Guide."
[time=653] And now we have a new booklet we want to share with you entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=658] Don, would you share just a little bit about that booklet?
[time=661] Well, Pastor Rick, one of the most practical books that we have ever offered on the Bible Hour is this little book, Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=669] It is filled with good thoughts and good helps for overcoming the idea of thinking constantly of negative thoughts.
[time=679] And some people are obsessed with thoughts like this.
[time=681] It's normal to have a negative thought now and again, but there's a balance between the negative and the positive, and the positive, but people who are inundated with just plain negative thinking really need help.
[time=692] And this book is very, very practical for that.
[time=695] In fact, some of the parts of the book are God's plan really works.
[time=701] Let me just read a part that says, "But once we have asked for God's help, we must all hold on to our side of the divine cooperative.
[time=709] We must fill our minds with thoughts pleasing to God by opening his word and letting our minds feed on his truth."
[time=716] That's a very practical thought.
[time=718] And this is filled with practical thoughts on how we can overcome negative thinking.
[time=723] If you'd like one of these books, we'd be just so delighted to send you one.
[time=727] Write to us the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=742] In the past, we've shared with you that we're looking forward to several special guests coming and sharing in the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=750] Next week, we have Mr. Ron Soussek, an evangelist coming.
[time=754] He was with us this summer, wasn't he, Don?
[time=756] Yes, he was.
[time=757] Ron Soussek is a tremendous evangelist.
[time=759] And those who were in our Bible Conference this summer remember him.
[time=762] And he was a blessing to all of us.
[time=764] Well, we've invited him back to be a part of our pulpit supply list for this fall.
[time=771] And he's going to be with us.
[time=772] We're just delighted that he's going to be with us.
[time=774] He comes from my neck of the woods.
[time=776] And so that kind of makes him kind of special to me.
[time=779] He comes from New Jersey.
[time=781] He lives now in York, Pennsylvania.
[time=783] He is the announcer on the Fort Lauderdale Bible Television Program.
[time=789] With Dr. James Kennedy.
[time=792] I couldn't remember who that was, but he is their announcer and Diane, his wife, sings on that program too.
[time=798] Ron is going to be with us and we're just delighted for that.
[time=801] I'm looking forward to his ministry too.
[time=804] I first met him when he spoke at the Chapel University Park shortly after I became a Christian.
[time=810] And then I've heard him two or three times since then.
[time=812] And God has always used him to encourage my life.
[time=815] I'm looking forward to that.
[time=817] And I know you'll be blessed by his ministry next week.
[time=820] Thank you again for joining us today.
[time=822] And I'm thankful for this special time for Don and I just to talk with you people for a few moments.
[time=828] And we just want to thank you who have provided for the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=834] And we're so grateful for your faithful support.
[time=837] God bless you.
[time=838] And if you'd like to write to us today, please write to the Bible Hour.
[time=842] Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=846] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=847] That's Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=851] Don, we have a special sponsor for the Bible Hour today, don't we?
[time=854] Yes, Mr. John Kranning from Peru, Indiana.
[time=858] And we're just so delighted that he has been helping us.
[time=861] And he is an associate sponsor for today.
[time=863] We thank you, Mr. Kranning.
[time=865] God bless you and have a great day.
[time=874] Thank you, Mr. John.
[time=895] Thank you, Mr. John Kranning.
[time=913] Please open your heart to hear his voice and be His such an every joy.
[time=923] Praise the Lord for this is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=928] Rejoice and be glad there is.
[time=932] Lift up your voice and sing to Christ the living King.
[time=936] Joys and be glad.
[time=949] The ladies have just sung for us a familiar call to worship that we'd love to hear them sing.
[time=954] They're going to sing another song for us now, a familiar song, but they're going to do it in a new form of harmony.
[time=967] Sing your like a shepherd lead us.
[time=977] Much we need thy tender loving care.
[time=986] In thy pleasant pastures feed us.
[time=996] For our youth thy wondrous folks prepare.
[time=1005] Set Savior above we pray.
[time=1016] Look down in love today into our hearts thy joys impart away.
[time=1028] Sing your like a shepherd lead us.
[time=1039] Mine forever more will always be.
[time=1050] Sing your like a shepherd lead us.
[time=1059] Much we need thy tender loving care.
[time=1069] In thy pleasant pastures feed us.
[time=1079] For our youth thy wondrous folks prepare.
[time=1094] Look down in love today into our hearts thy joys impart away.
[time=1111] Sing your like a shepherd lead us.
[time=1123] Mine forever more we will always be.
[time=1135] Sing your like a shepherd lead us.
[time=1158] A good reminder of the love of God that he guides us promises to be the shepherd of Psalm 23 to give guidance to our life.
[time=1172] A few weeks ago we had a special group come in who we really enjoyed and appreciated who ministered to our hearts called the sunlight quartet.
[time=1180] We have our own quartet here and they told me this morning they are changing their name from the min singers to the moonlight quartet.
[time=1188] I'm not quite sure that's actually going to happen but we so appreciate their ministry.
[time=1193] We are going to sing a song for us today entitled Oh Father in Heaven, the min singers.
[time=1210] Oh Father in Heaven, we honor your name.
[time=1240] We watch your kingdom to come, we watch your will to be done here on earth as in heaven above.
[time=1264] Give us this day, please give us our daily prayer and forgive our sins just as we have done for others.
[time=1293] Please don't bring us to temptation.
[time=1324] But deliver us, oh deliver us from the evil one.
[time=1342] For yours is a kingdom, yours is a power to you.
[time=1355] We give glory now and forever more.
[time=1378] Amen, amen, amen.
[time=1398] And from our hearts we add a final amen.
[time=1402] This rills my hearts to hear songs that sing about the reality that we're not really a part of this kingdom but that we have a far greater home.
[time=1411] We labor for a far greater cause and our final kingdom is Jesus Christ.
[time=1416] I don't know whether this is really appropriate or not but I often like in church to half-time in a football game.
[time=1423] I don't mean half-time when the band comes out and you sit and watch the band.
[time=1427] I mean half-time for the players.
[time=1429] Some of you probably played football and you know what I mean.
[time=1433] You play a half of a game and there you get dirty and battered and bruised and sometimes a little bit behind on the scoreboard.
[time=1441] And you go down into the locker room and your coach usually does two things.
[time=1446] He gives you a little pep talk, gives you a little bit of encouragement to go out for that second half.
[time=1452] Then also they take time for some instruction. We always had a chalkboard and our coach would draw circles and axes representing offensive and defensive players and he would give us some instruction about the second half.
[time=1466] Life in many ways is like a football game.
[time=1469] Six days a week we labor fighting a battle.
[time=1472] We're not only a game but an actual battle.
[time=1475] Then on the seventh day we come to this place to worship the study God's word that our hearts might be encouraged.
[time=1482] Not just for an emotional pep talk but that we might be genuinely encouraged of God.
[time=1488] That we might study His word and that we might be instructed.
[time=1491] And so we've met today to worship, to sing praises to God.
[time=1495] We've met to be of encouragement one to another.
[time=1498] We've also met that we might study God's word and receive instruction how we ought to live for these next days.
[time=1504] Let's begin by turning in our Bibles to Philippians the first chapter.
[time=1509] Paul was a great man of God. He was one who loved athletics.
[time=1514] Paul often wrote using a metaphor or a figure of speech out of the realm of athletics to drive home an illustration of a point that he was trying to make.
[time=1524] Paul was a tremendous motivator of people.
[time=1527] He had the ability to speak with eloquence, to attract crowds, to communicate the word of God.
[time=1533] And in Philippians he gives to us some instruction, some encouragement as to how we should live.
[time=1540] Philippians chapter 1 verses 20 through 26.
[time=1544] According to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed.
[time=1552] But that with all boldness as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by my life or by death.
[time=1564] For me to live is Christ and to die is game.
[time=1570] But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor.
[time=1575] Yet what I shall choose, I know not. For I am in a straight between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better, and nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
[time=1595] And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith, that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by coming to you again.
[time=1615] Within this passage of Scripture we come to one of the most famous statements of the Apostle Paul in Philippians 1-21, where he said, "For me to live is Christ and to die is game."
[time=1630] In many ways this verse represents something of a code or a creed, perhaps a motto of the life of the great Apostle Paul.
[time=1639] For me to live is Christ and to die is game. Many organizations develop within their work a concept of a creed or a motto, something that becomes a rallying point, a point of definition for that organization.
[time=1654] I want to grace theological seminary. And there in the wall in one of the chapels they have their creed or their motto.
[time=1661] It says, "To know him and to make him known, that represents their purpose, their creed." Some of you grew up in the scouts and you remember the motto, "To be prepared."
[time=1673] It's a motto, a little code that represents something of the philosophy of the scouts.
[time=1679] As a student of history we read and we come to the great person, Socrates, who was looking for that which would give direction to his life, who was looking for a motto, went to the oracle of Delphi, and there at the oracle of Delphi he was given that which would guide his life.
[time=1694] In the oracle said, "Know thyself, know thyself." Paul had a motto, a creed, something that gave direction to his life, it was this, "For me to live is Christ and to die is game."
[time=1710] That's a noble goal. That's an awful lofty creed for me to look at today.
[time=1716] I'm not quite sure that my life measures up to that creed. How about you?
[time=1722] As we look for definition and direction in life, something that would represent our conduct and our character, to say, "For me to live is Christ and to die is game."
[time=1733] Perhaps that's something we don't see within our reach today. We can't quite obtain that level of dedication.
[time=1740] But you know it's important for us to know that these are the words of a man who's known Christ for 25 or 30 years. He's been an apostle.
[time=1748] This is the words of a mature man, someone who has struggled and come through life walking with Christ.
[time=1755] These are not just the words of lofty, youthful idealism. These are just not the words of one that just likes to quote off at a prayer meeting and talk about their own spirituality.
[time=1766] These are the words of one of the greatest men of God who've ever lived.
[time=1770] And yet they can not only be an example for us, they can be a challenge at which we can strive towards.
[time=1778] Paul was speaking of a relationship that he had in Christ. We have a relationship in Christ, each and every one of us.
[time=1785] And many times I liken the relationship that we have with Christ to the relationship we have with our spouses.
[time=1792] They start off as rather boyish and immature.
[time=1796] But then they grow to a point of decision. And after that decision a sense of responsibility and sometimes even frustration.
[time=1804] And then finally to a point of recommitment.
[time=1807] Men, can you remember when you first found somebody you really liked? I mean this girl was special and you really liked her.
[time=1815] And you wanted to let her know that, but you weren't quite brave enough in junior high just to walk up to somebody.
[time=1821] And so what you usually did is you went to one of your friends and you explained your predicament.
[time=1827] And then your friend went to her friend and he began to explain your feelings to her friend.
[time=1834] Well she understood that and she went to her friend who you like and explains it.
[time=1839] Now she's not brave enough to respond so she sends the message back through her friend who tells your friend.
[time=1845] And in the meantime a new guy moved in the block and took her away from you.
[time=1850] Do you remember some of those times of dating and immaturity and how your heart was simply attracted but you just didn't quite know how to cope with it?
[time=1858] I remember in our lockers in junior high they had these little slots in and that was to let the aroma of your gym stuff out.
[time=1865] But those slots were really helpful because if you liked someone you could write a little note and tuck it in that slot.
[time=1873] Do you remember those notes used to start off?
[time=1876] I love you and then you scratch out love and you put like.
[time=1880] You know you don't want to be too forceful at first.
[time=1882] I like you.
[time=1884] Magic question.
[time=1885] Do you like me?
[time=1888] Then you followed that with two little boxes.
[time=1891] One little box and it said yes, not a little box and it said no.
[time=1896] And then at the bottom you put a little PS.
[time=1898] The PS was this.
[time=1899] Don't say maybe.
[time=1901] And then being a crafty sly person you would wait until the bell rang.
[time=1905] You'd go out in the hall with your note meticulously folded up and you'd keep that hidden in your pocket so no one would know what you're up to.
[time=1912] And you'd walk by their locker.
[time=1914] And you'd wait until just about everybody else was back in class and no one could see you.
[time=1918] And you'd take that note and flick it in that slot of their locker and you'd wait for days for them to discover that note and to return it the same way in your locker.
[time=1928] I can remember checking my locker eight ten times a day.
[time=1931] No note ever came back.
[time=1934] Would you remember those young years of romance and excitement.
[time=1938] How there was just this gleeful optimism and used to sit and the daydream.
[time=1943] You know there are many that daydream about their spiritual life.
[time=1946] All the things they love to do.
[time=1948] You know they just love to serve Jesus Christ in a great way.
[time=1951] But it's really just this youthful dreamy idealism.
[time=1956] Kind of like the notes in the locker and the daydreaming through algebra class.
[time=1962] But you know there comes a point in our relationship men and women.
[time=1966] When we go past the daydream and we become serious and we come to a point of decision.
[time=1971] And we ask someone if they'll marry us and they'll be our partner for life.
[time=1975] You know after that decision reality begins to set in.
[time=1979] Someone once said that two can live as cheap as one. He lied.
[time=1985] Two people don't live as cheap as one.
[time=1988] I don't think two people live as cheap as two.
[time=1991] When we first got married we had to take out an eight hundred dollar loan in order to pay a little bit of school off.
[time=1999] And I lived in an apartment and I rented one room cost ten dollars a week.
[time=2003] We went out to get apartments.
[time=2005] I thought two can live as cheap as one. Ten dollars a week at the high twenty was a hundred and thirty five dollars.
[time=2011] And it was over a garage.
[time=2013] We lived in an apartment the size of a garage.
[time=2016] A hundred and thirty five dollars.
[time=2019] Suddenly the reality of marriage was beginning to set in.
[time=2023] And then there became a real dilemma.
[time=2026] I had to be at school at seven thirty. She had to be at work at eight o'clock.
[time=2030] Men have you ever tried to get your wife ready a half hour early?
[time=2035] That's pressure. There's dilemma.
[time=2038] How are you going to solve that?
[time=2040] Some of the realities began to set in in life.
[time=2044] Sometimes there's even frustration and disappointment.
[time=2048] But then there comes the walk of maturity and a time of recommitment.
[time=2053] Now that you really understand life, you really understand marriage.
[time=2057] There's a time for recommitment.
[time=2060] And it's good in our marriages no matter where we are to renew our commitment to each other.
[time=2065] Thrilled my heart a year ago to see Earl and Marianna Dixon recommit their love to each other.
[time=2071] Marianne's gone to be with the Lord now, but last year they went through a wedding ceremony recommitting their love to each other.
[time=2082] A recommitment. Our spiritual life often follows that same trail.
[time=2088] I remember coming to Christ.
[time=2091] I'd come from a home that we were all new Christians in my teen years.
[time=2095] And my concept of Christianity was that it was for women.
[time=2098] My mom was a Christian. My sister was a Christian.
[time=2101] I wasn't a Christian.
[time=2103] And my mom would have little Bible studies and these ladies would come.
[time=2107] And they'd come on Tuesday morning.
[time=2109] And they would sit around with their Bibles open in their tea and in all their nice clothes.
[time=2114] And they'd have a Bible study about noon I came in in the summer time from swim practice.
[time=2119] And I looked at that and just couldn't believe it.
[time=2122] Now the last thing I wanted to be was a tea-toten Bible study in Christian.
[time=2127] That was women. That's what Christianity was to me.
[time=2131] But then I met a man's man, an all-American football player who loved Christ.
[time=2137] And suddenly that youthful idealism came. I could be a Christian.
[time=2141] I could be just like David Burnham, great football player.
[time=2145] The man's man, preacher. I'll become a Christian and be a preacher.
[time=2149] That was youthful idealism. I didn't know what I was talking about.
[time=2153] But you know there came a point later in my life where I made a decision.
[time=2156] That decision was to invite Christ in my heart.
[time=2159] Later another decision came. And that was to go into the ministry.
[time=2163] Now that's far beyond the youthful idealism. This is time for deciding.
[time=2167] But you know when I made those decisions I didn't know of many of the cost.
[time=2171] Many of the responsibilities. Many of the consequences.
[time=2175] I love to swim. I swam competitively. And I thought well then I'll just go study for the ministry.
[time=2180] I'll go to a Christian school that has a swimming team and there I can have the best of both worlds.
[time=2186] To the best of my knowledge in 1971 there wasn't a school in the country that was a Christian school
[time=2192] that had a swim team. I ended up at a school that didn't even have a swimming pool.
[time=2196] They had a lake. It was mucky. I had to give up swimming.
[time=2200] That's a small cost but not an 18.
[time=2204] And then you begin to discover when you want to go into the ministry.
[time=2207] You go to college and then there's graduate school and you discover you get ripped off men in graduate school.
[time=2213] If you go get at most master's degrees it takes you one year.
[time=2217] You go into theology and it takes three or four years. Cost three or four times as much.
[time=2221] Begin to count the cost. Did I really want to do that?
[time=2225] It was a time of rediscovery. Time of recommitment.
[time=2229] One of the things that thrilled my heart just a few years ago.
[time=2233] Noel Irwin sang a song at our home church back in Akron, Ohio.
[time=2237] Now the thing that was thrilling was not that Noel had such a great voice.
[time=2241] He wasn't a singer at all. He was a preacher. Noel was in his 70s.
[time=2245] Middle of a great concert, they asked him to sing. And he sang these words.
[time=2253] "Since I started towards the kingdom, since my life he controls,
[time=2259] since I gave my heart to Jesus, the longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows."
[time=2267] Recommitment was saint of a minister of the gospel in his 70s.
[time=2273] The longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows.
[time=2277] No, much of the Apostle Paul's life was like that.
[time=2281] He came to know Christ en route to persecuting Christians.
[time=2285] He was on his way to Damascus that he might persecute Christians or rest them.
[time=2289] Perhaps even kill him. The Apostle Paul held the coats of those that stone Stephen.
[time=2295] But on that journey Christ spoke to him in a real way. He appeared to him as a great light.
[time=2300] And he said, "Saul, Saul, why persecute us thou me?" And Saul said, "Who is it, Lord? Who is it, Lord?" The voice said, "I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecute us." And Paul said, not knowing that which the future wouldn't counter.
[time=2317] "Lord, what would you have me to do?" On that first occasion Jesus Christ told him that he would speak before Gentiles and before kings.
[time=2326] It seemed great to the Apostle Paul.
[time=2329] There was this great enticement of being the spokesman for God.
[time=2332] But later the hardships came.
[time=2335] Later there came the missionary journey where he'd be stoned outside of Lystra.
[time=2339] Then there came the Jews who would lay hands on him who would actually beat him 39 times.
[time=2345] One short of death.
[time=2347] There became the hardships in the life.
[time=2350] Paul would say a word of recommitment in Philippians for me to live as Christ and to die is gain.
[time=2359] It reflects the consummation of a lifelong relationship.
[time=2364] And yet as we read those words today they can give to us direction for our life.
[time=2370] What would be the motto of your life?
[time=2375] I don't know that there's one of us today that live and walk with the same conduct and the same character.
[time=2381] The same intensity and drive as the Apostle Paul.
[time=2384] But what would be the conduct of our life?
[time=2387] What would be our creed and our code?
[time=2389] Fill in the blank.
[time=2391] For me to live is blank and to die is blank.
[time=2396] What would you fill in this morning?
[time=2398] What would you say out of your life?
[time=2402] Would you say for me to live is fame and to die is to be forgotten?
[time=2409] Would you say for me to live today is wealth and fortune?
[time=2414] But to die is to leave it all behind.
[time=2418] Would you say for me to live today is my family and my friends and to die is to be alone?
[time=2428] What would be the creed of your life?
[time=2431] Our work, our family, our fortune, they're all noble goals.
[time=2436] But what would be the goal of our life?
[time=2438] Now many of us men have made the goal out of success.
[time=2442] We labor.
[time=2443] We're what the new society is called the workaholics.
[time=2446] We like to work and the more we work, the more we like to work.
[time=2449] We come home, we complain about the hard day and the pressure, but really we choose to bring it on ourselves.
[time=2454] For us to live is to work.
[time=2457] What would you fill in the blanks?
[time=2459] For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[time=2463] Lofty words, difficult words to obtain and to match.
[time=2467] But yet they begin to set an example for us and somewhere we're in that relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2473] Somewhere between that boyish idealism and those little notes we stuck in the locker and true love and commitment.
[time=2481] Somewhere between attraction to Christ and actually singing the longer I serve in the sweeter he grows.
[time=2488] Where are we this morning in our own individual walk with Christ?
[time=2492] Paul not only gives to us his creed, but in verse 22 through 23 he outlines his choices.
[time=2499] But if I live in the flesh, that is the fruit of my labor.
[time=2504] Yet I shall choose I know not, for I am in a strait between two having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better nevertheless to abide with you in the flesh is more needful for you.
[time=2521] Paul said Paul looked at his life.
[time=2523] He looked at the option of life.
[time=2527] What would attract him?
[time=2529] You know, but for Paul life was Christ.
[time=2532] It was that which absolutely consumed him.
[time=2536] Life is what you're alive to.
[time=2538] My wife is alive to shopping.
[time=2541] I'm utterly dead.
[time=2542] I cannot think of anything more boring to do than to go shopping, just to go out to one of the stores and to look.
[time=2549] And I go, you know, and I've got one kid under one arm, one of the other and smiling, isn't this?
[time=2554] I am dead to shopping.
[time=2556] You know, it doesn't matter what department we're in.
[time=2559] Even if it's the athletic department and we're going by footballs and bats and tennis rackets, I'm dead to shopping.
[time=2566] I just don't like to shop.
[time=2568] We can go through the hardware department.
[time=2570] I can see some new bits for a router and different tools.
[time=2573] I just would rather not be there.
[time=2575] I'm dead to shopping.
[time=2576] But there's one department that makes me come alive.
[time=2579] It's ties.
[time=2581] I love to shop for ties.
[time=2583] I don't know why that is, but I love the shop for ties.
[time=2587] Doesn't matter.
[time=2588] Nice store, crummy store.
[time=2589] Oh, look at their ties.
[time=2590] You know, look how wide they are in their pattern.
[time=2593] I think this would match this and this might match another.
[time=2596] I'm alive to ties.
[time=2598] I wore this tie just to share it with you this morning.
[time=2601] This tie is somewhere between 12 and 13 years old.
[time=2604] You may remember that back in ties were about this wide.
[time=2607] You could substitute them for a tablecloth.
[time=2609] This was one of those wide ties.
[time=2612] I like this tie and I took it to a tailor and I asked him to cut it down.
[time=2617] I'm alive to ties.
[time=2618] He wouldn't cut it down.
[time=2619] I did it myself.
[time=2621] I'm not going to show you the back of this tie.
[time=2627] I just laid it down.
[time=2628] I took a big red magic marker on the backside and I marked it where I went.
[time=2632] I cut it, ironed it, and I almost glued the backside of it.
[time=2637] You can't tell that so I can wear my favorite tie today.
[time=2642] I'm alive to ties.
[time=2643] You know, all of us have little things that make us come alive.
[time=2646] What makes you come alive?
[time=2648] Is it the football games on Monday night?
[time=2651] Do you come alive for that?
[time=2652] Do you come dragging in the house, growling about what a day you had, and suddenly at eight o'clock to come alive?
[time=2660] I do that sometimes too.
[time=2662] A lot of things make you come alive.
[time=2665] What makes you come alive?
[time=2667] What gives your life zest and vitality?
[time=2669] What makes you excited?
[time=2671] The Apostle Paul was sincerely and genuinely Jesus Christ made him come alive.
[time=2679] You know, in my heart there's a lot of things that make me come alive.
[time=2682] Football does.
[time=2683] Basketball sort of.
[time=2685] Baseball not at all.
[time=2687] Ties do.
[time=2688] Food does.
[time=2689] One of my favorite sports is eating.
[time=2692] It's all year round sport and never out of season.
[time=2694] It makes me come alive.
[time=2696] You know, there's also a part of my heart that comes alive to Jesus Christ.
[time=2701] I trust today there's a part of your heart that comes alive at the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2707] You know, the Apostle Paul was a man who had reached a great level of spirituality.
[time=2711] I'm not there.
[time=2712] I don't know where you're at, but I'm not where he was.
[time=2715] But you know, we're on a journey.
[time=2718] We're not actually part of this kingdom.
[time=2720] We're part of another kingdom and Christ should be ever increasing so that as we grow each day, we can say that we're coming closer to this great creed for me to live as Christ
[time=2731] in the dais game.
[time=2733] What makes you come alive this morning?
[time=2736] For Paul Christ was the beginning of life.
[time=2740] Everything that he was before he came to Christ, he counted as an utter loss.
[time=2745] Paul was an educated man.
[time=2747] He was a man of letters.
[time=2748] He was a student of Gamalia, trained at the University of Tarsus.
[time=2753] Paul was a man of religious background.
[time=2755] He was a Pharisee.
[time=2756] He was a religious leader.
[time=2759] Paul was of the right nationality.
[time=2760] He was not only a Jew.
[time=2761] He was a Benjamin.
[time=2762] He was from the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2766] But Christ is what made him come alive.
[time=2768] It wasn't his education.
[time=2769] It wasn't his nationality.
[time=2771] It wasn't his background.
[time=2772] It wasn't his citizenship.
[time=2774] Christ made him come alive.
[time=2776] Christ was not only in the beginning of life, he was the driving force of his life.
[time=2781] Christ was also the end to which he lived and he would die.
[time=2785] For me to live is Christ.
[time=2788] And to die is gain.
[time=2790] Now it's interesting to talk about death.
[time=2793] We don't like to talk about death in our society.
[time=2795] Have you ever listened to an insurance man?
[time=2797] They say, "If something should happen to you." You know why they say it?
[time=2802] No one wants to sit down and say, "Well, suppose you were to die." You know, we don't like to talk about death.
[time=2808] Suppose something was to happen to you.
[time=2811] In many ways, the job of the funeral home is to take that one who's dead and as much as possible make them look like they're alive.
[time=2821] And so the appropriate thing that we're supposed to say is, "Oh, they look just like they're sleeping." You know, to be honest, I've never seen anyone who was dead that didn't look dead.
[time=2831] Never seen one that really looked like they were asleep.
[time=2835] We don't like to talk about death.
[time=2837] So we want to cover up the body with makeup and we want to hide it with euphemisms.
[time=2842] But here is one that like to talk about death, the Apostle Paul.
[time=2847] He'd talk about death as great gain.
[time=2850] He would say, "For me to live is Christ and to die is gain." That doesn't ring true.
[time=2857] Most of us don't think of death as gain.
[time=2861] And there have been those that wrote and they've written about death and in their writing about death, the only game they can see is it's the end of life's misery.
[time=2870] Shakespeare wrote Hamlet and the words of Hamlet were that he "distained life but he feared death more."
[time=2878] So Hamlet raises the question to be or not to be.
[time=2883] That is the question whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[time=2893] or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die, to sleep.
[time=2901] No more and by sleep to say we end the heartache, the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.
[time=2908] Oh, 'tis a consuming consummating thought devoutly to be wished.
[time=2914] What was Hamlet saying?
[time=2916] He was saying that life is so bad.
[time=2919] His uncle had killed his father.
[time=2921] His uncle then married his mother and claimed the throne.
[time=2925] And Hamlet was to avenge his father's death.
[time=2929] And he looked at life and with its fortunes and its slings and arrows he said, "Oh, it would just be better to die."
[time=2935] Was that really the mind of the apostle Paul?
[time=2938] Was life so bad?
[time=2940] Was life so brutal that he just wanted to give up?
[time=2944] And therefore death was gained because it was an escape?
[time=2947] You know, there's some of that philosophy in our culture today.
[time=2951] There was a German existential philosopher by the name of Karl Jaspers.
[time=2956] And Jaspers says to know that life has meaning as impossible.
[time=2960] For the only thing that gives meaning to life is one great experience.
[time=2964] It's a personal experience.
[time=2966] Therefore, you can't communicate it to someone else.
[time=2969] And there were those students who couldn't find life's great experience.
[time=2973] And Jaspers said, "Perhaps life's great experience is a terminal experience." And some of his students took him seriously and entered into a terminal experience of death.
[time=2984] Looking for meaning in life.
[time=2986] Is that the apostle Paul?
[time=2988] Was he a lonely existentialist who really couldn't find fulfillment in life?
[time=2992] That each challenge just was followed by another challenge and the most exciting thing you could think of was absolutely boring.
[time=2999] And so he looked for a terminal experience and he'd say, "Death is gain." Oh no.
[time=3004] Listen to what Hamlet said as he thought about death.
[time=3008] He said, "For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come.
[time=3013] When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause.
[time=3020] There's the respect that makes calamity so life long.
[time=3026] Who would bear the burden to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death,
[time=3034] the undiscovered country from whose born no traveler returns, puzzles the will,
[time=3041] and makes us rather bear those ills we have than to fly to others that we know not of.
[time=3048] And thus conscience does make cowards of us all." Hamlet was saying, "Oh, I would choose to die, except that I don't know what's around in death's corner.
[time=3059] I don't know what's there, and therefore my desire for life supersedes my desire for death
[time=3065] because I'm afraid it's a country that no one returns from.
[time=3070] And conscience does make cowards of us all." And all saying then, "I'd love to die and be gained to escape my troubles, but not really because I don't know what's around the corner.
[time=3083] All new. Christ was the resurrection.
[time=3088] And Paul had seen the resurrected Christ and he knew what was around the corner.
[time=3093] For Hamlet, life was misery and death was agony.
[time=3098] But for Paul, life was blessing and death was much more.
[time=3102] For Hamlet, death was stepping out of the light and groping in the dark.
[time=3107] But for Paul, death was stepping out of the dark and into the marvelous light of Jesus Christ.
[time=3116] Paul was not afraid to die.
[time=3118] He was not afraid of what was around the corner.
[time=3120] He didn't loathe life.
[time=3122] He wasn't looking for the existential experience, the great cop-out.
[time=3126] Paul loved life.
[time=3128] Life was Christ, but death was gain.
[time=3132] Death was gained not as an escape from the persecution of the Romans, for the personal problems and tragedies of life.
[time=3140] For Paul, death was gained for two reasons.
[time=3143] First of all, that he would be with Christ.
[time=3147] More than anything else, the Apostle Paul wanted to be with Christ.
[time=3152] He said, "For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ."
[time=3161] Christ was everything to Paul and he wanted to be with him.
[time=3167] It is not uncommon nor is it wrong that when someone loses their spouse
[time=3174] and their golden years of life, that many times they look forward to death to be reunited to that spouse because there's a love bond there.
[time=3182] For Paul, the love bond was Jesus Christ.
[time=3186] And for him to die was to be with Christ.
[time=3190] But secondly, it was not only to be with Christ, it was to be like Christ.
[time=3194] For the Bible says that when we see him, we shall be like him before we shall see him as he is.
[time=3201] Paul would become like Christ.
[time=3203] We will become like Christ when we go to be with him.
[time=3207] I don't know about you, but Paul and I both suffer from spiritual schizophrenia.
[time=3212] Have you ever had that problem?
[time=3214] Paul wrote about it in Romans 7.
[time=3216] He said, "That which I would, that which I really want to do, I don't do."
[time=3222] And those things which I got up this morning, I said, "Lord, I'm not going to do that anymore." I've already done it twice today. It's not even lunchtime.
[time=3232] There's a schizophrenia almost.
[time=3234] It's our personality that inside us, the old man wants to do this and the new man says, "You ought not to do that." The new man said, "You ought to do this." The old man said, "I don't want to do that." Paul knew of that struggle.
[time=3246] And he knew that when he went to be with Christ, he would be like Christ.
[time=3251] Do you know that in heaven, we're not going to need to go on diets?
[time=3256] And when we go on one, if we choose to, we'll have the willpower to stay on one.
[time=3262] Willpower. Character.
[time=3264] That becomes just like Christ.
[time=3266] That we possess the very likeness of Christ.
[time=3268] The Bible says, "When we see him, we shall be likened, for we shall see him face to face."
[time=3274] In 1 John, chapter 3, verse 1.
[time=3278] Death was not an escape for Paul.
[time=3280] It was great gain.
[time=3281] It was to be with Christ and then to be like Christ.
[time=3285] But Paul says he's caught in a straight.
[time=3288] He doesn't know.
[time=3289] He'd like to be with Christ, but nevertheless, verse 24, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
[time=3297] He wanted to serve, so he left it in the hands of God.
[time=3301] And then he spoke with confidence, having this confidence, that I know I shall abide and continue with you all for the furtherance of your joy in your faith.
[time=3310] Paul expected deliverance from prison.
[time=3312] He was willing to live for Christ.
[time=3317] So Paul was outlined before us.
[time=3319] First of all, a code, a creed, that which we could live by.
[time=3322] Not that we're there today, but it simply outlines the challenge of how we ought to live.
[time=3327] Then not only with that does he give us a code and a creed, but he outlines the choice that he faced.
[time=3333] To live was to live for Christ.
[time=3335] It made him come alive.
[time=3337] To die was great gain.
[time=3339] Great gain.
[time=3341] The choice.
[time=3342] And then the confidence to know that he would serve Christ whether he lived or died.
[time=3347] No, there are three great historical figures alive at this time.
[time=3353] There was Nero, the emperor.
[time=3356] There was Seneca, the philosopher, and there was Paul, the apostle.
[time=3362] Nero, the emperor, was adopted by Claudius, came to power at an early age, trained by the
[time=3369] philosopher, Seneca, aided in his military struggles and leadership by Brontas.
[time=3375] And he rose to power.
[time=3377] He was a gifted man, a good administrator.
[time=3380] He was a gifted man, very capable in the arts.
[time=3383] But he was a man who had a hunger and a quest for pleasure.
[time=3386] And he slowly deteriorated his own empire in his greedy quest for personal pleasure.
[time=3392] So greedy was the power and pleasure that he killed his own mother, then his wife, then rather anyone who threatened him.
[time=3399] He lived for pleasure.
[time=3401] He even took the life of his two.
[time=3404] Seneca's.
[time=3405] Because Seneca's represented a different philosophy.
[time=3408] The philosophy that says life is not for pleasure.
[time=3411] Life is for duty.
[time=3413] And Seneca taught of the stoic philosophy of a duty of life that a form that you had to be following.
[time=3420] But Seneca took his own life in misery.
[time=3425] Nero took his own life.
[time=3427] But Paul would save evil life and leave a death.
[time=3431] Only Jesus Christ can give the confidence to face life and to face death.
[time=3436] An emperor doesn't have it.
[time=3438] A philosopher doesn't have it.
[time=3440] Only an apostle who has Jesus Christ in his heart.
