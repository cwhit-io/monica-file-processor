[time=0] In Fort Wayne, Indiana we present the Bible Hour.
[time=4] Sing my soul, my sleep, my dream, I'll bring the warm, I'll bring the warm, I'll bring the warm.
[time=41] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=47] We want to wish you a very good morning today and are delighted that you've come to worship with us.
[time=53] We want to say a special hello to our many, many friends who are joining us at this time for the Bible Hour.
[time=60] We have today as our special guest Mr. Ron Susig.
[time=64] Ron has been here before to speak in our summer Bible conference and we had a tremendous hour in our earlier service this morning.
[time=73] Many, many people today made their decision to make Jesus Christ Savior of their life and have received him.
[time=80] Others today for the first time made a commitment to Christ that he would be Lord.
[time=85] We encourage you to give us 100% of your time and your attention in these next hours that you might experience the life-changing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=96] We're so thankful that you've come to worship with us today and will begin by a hymn of praise as our choir leads us under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger as they sing, come now found of every blessing.
[time=126] (Music)
[time=156] I am bound for the kingdom who you go, glory with me, I live through your praise alone.
[time=173] (Music)
[time=181] (Music) (Music)
[time=196] (Music)
[time=233] There is a ring within our hearts that says amen. We've come today to praise God. One of the reasons we have to praise him is for the people within our congregation that he has raised up to serve his name.
[time=248] I have with me this morning a friend Mike Ballast who God has called into Christian service and Mike you've got an exciting future ahead of you.
[time=258] God has called us to be missionaries to Japan to the Japanese nation less than 1% of the Japanese population are Christians.
[time=267] Even though there is only 1% of the population that has come to Christ that these are particularly opportune days to present the gospel in Japan.
[time=276] Yes Rick, the missionaries over there say that this is probably one of the greatest opportunities for revival in Japan since World War II. There are some really good signs that people are starting to respond to the gospel.
[time=290] Mike, I understand that part of that reason is because people are becoming atheists which sounds strange to us but how does it happen that the gospel is more advantageously proclaimed in a day when people are turning to atheism?
[time=304] Many of the Japanese people are turning their back on the old religions and the old traditions and now are claiming they've taken surveys every year since World War II and less than half of the people in Japan claim any religion at all.
[time=317] The result of that is that they have a big vacuum in their lives and a wonderful opportunity for Christians to present the gospel and the claims of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=326] You know Mike, I'm excited about that opportunity and I'm so thankful that God has raised up servants from our congregation but people live under kind of a strange belief that Christian workers are different than other people.
[time=340] I remember telling kids when I was a youth speaker that I was born a human, it wasn't until later that I became a pastor but really we're just people. How did God take you as a regular person and motivate you to become a missionary?
[time=353] Well I felt the Lord leading me into Christian service and full-time Christian work when I was in high school and following seminary my wife and I and our four children were in the pastorate for six years and during that time the Lord laid a real burden on our hearts for Christian education.
[time=369] And teaching and I went to school to sharpen those kinds of tools the Lord had given me and during that time the Lord brought several things together one of them was the tremendous need in missionary schools, schools for missionary kids.
[time=384] We're going to be teaching at the Christian Academy in Japan dealing with Christian young people there, children of missionary parents and then also there's a tremendous need in Japan especially for Christian education in the churches.
[time=397] The churches in Japan Christian education is almost non-existent.
[time=401] In fact many times while the adults have church the kids are outside playing and I really think that it's important for the next generation if the Japanese church is going to have an impact on their nation to reach these kids.
[time=414] Mike I'm excited about that that someone is being called to work in a foreign field but particularly with teenagers.
[time=421] 90% of the people who come to Christ make their initial decision for Jesus Christ before the age of 18 while their hearts are tender and sensitive I'm glad God's called you there.
[time=433] You're going out with far eastern gospel crusade correct and that mission board although we don't understand it has in the hand of God suffered a great tragedy.
[time=443] And his own planning and his own time in God has taken five of your co-labors home to be with him through a tragic accident.
[time=451] Yes there was an airplane on September 13th they were on a trip with the ministry in mind and the airplane a twin engine bonanza went down in the ocean in the Pacific Ocean.
[time=463] We lost a former director of the mission very important missionary statesman as part of far eastern gospel crusade and several very key people in the Alaskan field and we're distrusting that the Lord has that all in his plan and is going to direct our mission from this point on.
[time=480] We have no idea why God chose to do that but we're thankful that even though he's taken some Christian servants home to be with him that he's called others to replace him.
[time=490] During this past month one of the executives of the crusade came and talked with me and was so excited about Mike and Carolyn ballast and is counting on them not only to be missionaries to the field of Japan but to become representatives leaders within the whole crusade.
[time=507] Mike we thank God for your testimony and your desire to serve him. God bless you. God calls each one of us to serve him. Sometimes he gives us a pulpit. Sometimes he calls us to a far away country but he calls every one of us to serve him right where we are.
[time=525] You don't have to wear a suit. You don't have to preach. Each one of us serve Jesus Christ. I trust today that you're a servant of Christ.
[time=534] A young man has a special gift which with he uses to serve Christ. It's the ministry of music and Keith Brodygan comes to sing for us using the gifts that God's given him. He could have called 10,000 angels.
[time=555] They bow the hands of Jesus. The garden where we pray. They let him through the streets in shame.
[time=572] They spat upon the saviour so pure and free from sin. They said crucify him and has to blame.
[time=589] He could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and setting free. He could have called 10,000 angels.
[time=617] But he tried alone for you and me.
[time=631] Upon his precious head they placed a crown of thorns. They laughed and said behold the king.
[time=646] They struck him and they cursed him and mocked his holy name. All alone he suffered everything.
[time=665] And when he cried, it finished.
[time=690] He cried his way to die. Salvation's won just when he was born. He could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free.
[time=719] He could have called 10,000 angels.
[time=732] But he died alone for you and me.
[time=761] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour. We have a special day today, don't we Don?
[time=768] We sure do with evangelist Ron Susack. He was with us this past summer and our people enjoyed him thoroughly and we're so glad that we can invite him back and he's here this day. I'm looking forward to it.
[time=779] I am too. But first of all we want to thank some very special people. Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Blocker are associate sponsors of the Bible hour today.
[time=788] Their special gift helped make this broadcast a possibility. We also have another associate sponsor, Mr. Curtis Uthene.
[time=796] We're so thankful to both of these families for allowing us to present today's Bible hour message and special music for you today.
[time=805] We appreciate their gifts that they have sent so that we can share God's Word with you on this beautiful day.
[time=812] Don has some information he wants to share with you about a booklet entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=818] Pastor Rick this tremendous little book written by our own Dr. Ken Nichols is so helpful and so practical and so many people have responded to it.
[time=826] We're just delighted that we're able to offer this to our television family and we want to give it to those who have yet not written in.
[time=834] Remedies for negative thinking is so practical. It's written by a professional, somebody who is studied in the field.
[time=840] And for instance if you were to take one of the subjects the mind at peace you'd find that Dr. Ken shares with us Bible reading prayer and fellowship with the Holy Spirit is an essential in order for us to have remedies for negative thinking.
[time=855] If you would like this book please send to the Bible hour that's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 and we would be glad to send this little book to you.
[time=869] I understand you had some struggles with negative thinking yesterday.
[time=873] Yes I did. My lawnmower didn't quite work the way I wanted it to. In fact it hasn't worked for a couple of weeks and I had just brought it back from the repairman and it still didn't work. I need this book myself.
[time=885] Well you're not the only one that needs that book all of us do. As a matter of fact we've been sending out over 300 of these booklets each week to people just like you who've written in to ask for this booklet.
[time=897] That's one of the special ministries of the Bible hour of putting Christian literature in the hands of people who are going to read it and apply it to their lives.
[time=906] And if you'd like this book just write to us today at the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=914] Again we have a special guest today but I'm going to wait a few minutes to tell you about that because I want to share with you a little bit about the financial needs of the Bible hour.
[time=925] Perhaps this past week you've received this letter from me. If you haven't you might be receiving it in just the next few days.
[time=932] What I've tried to do is to outline for you some of the financial needs of the Bible hour.
[time=938] It's important that you understand our financial position. We have existing about a $17,000 deficit that we have been carrying for many months.
[time=948] Each week the cost of the Bible hour is a little over $5,000. People sometimes ask how can it possibly cost that much?
[time=957] Well most of the cost goes directly into the purchasing of airtime and the production cost.
[time=964] As a matter of fact neither Don nor I or Dale Siglin have one penny of salary that comes from the Bible hour.
[time=971] All of the cameramen and the technicians who work to produce this show come as volunteers.
[time=977] The money that you send goes strictly into the production of this particular ministry.
[time=983] And we want to encourage you to write in today and to send us what you can as a love gift to help this ministry continue.
[time=991] I'm sure Pastor Rick that there are many people who have listened to the Bible hour who have not written to us.
[time=996] Thank you for those who have but I'm sure there are many many thousands who have not written. We would like to encourage you to sit down today.
[time=1003] Write a letter and tell us that you're listening to the Bible hour. You're being blessed by the messages by Pastor Rick and our special guests.
[time=1010] And then send your gift. We would appreciate it so very very much.
[time=1014] You know it is true that there are many many people who watch regularly that we don't even know about.
[time=1019] Many times when I go to the malls or the hospital I bump into people who let me know that they watch the Bible hour.
[time=1026] Then I'm always worried what my kids are doing at that time. I understand you met somebody who recognized you yesterday at a peculiar spot.
[time=1033] Yes I did and it was just delighted to talk with that person and fellowship with them and good to know that they were listening to the Bible hour.
[time=1040] You know Don is a famous garage sale shopper and that's where he was recognized yesterday but it's good just wherever we're at to get a chance to meet you.
[time=1048] Thank you for introducing yourself as we just bump into each other at different places here in the Fort Wayne community.
[time=1055] And won't you write in today and let us know that you're watching the Bible hour and help us financially.
[time=1061] We'd love to hear from you. And again today we have a special guest Mr. Ron Sousa.
[time=1067] Ron Sousa is from North Jersey. He studied at Essex Fell's Bible College and that's my part of the woods where I come from.
[time=1075] And we're just delighted that he's going to be with us evangelist Ron Sousa.
[time=1079] You stay tuned in just a few minutes you'll hear his message.
[time=1082] I've had opportunity to hear him speak several times. When I first became a Christian back in Akron, Ohio he was a guest speaker at the church I was attending.
[time=1091] Then when I was a student studying the Bible at Grace Theological Seminary I worked as a sound man in one of the auditoriums and Ron was a speaker on that occasion.
[time=1100] And finally he was just here in July and our people were thoroughly encouraged and appreciated his ministry.
[time=1107] And so we're going to go back to the service right now and hear some more encouraging music and then hear a message from Mr. Sousa.
[time=1115] Thank you for joining us today and again a special thanks to our associate sponsors Mr. Curtis Euthin and Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Blocker.
[time=1124] God bless you and have a great day.
[time=1130] [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=1191] If you know his name, if you know Christ Jesus, if your life's been changed by knowing his love, if you have been born again and the spirits in control, and you can't keep it to yourself, you've got to tell it everywhere.
[time=1220] You've got to tell it everywhere that you go. You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has won.
[time=1239] You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has done.
[time=1255] [MUSIC]
[time=1281] My life's complete. Now I can't give it to myself. I've got to tell everybody our needs. You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has won.
[time=1307] You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has won.
[time=1324] Everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has won. You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere. You've got to tell it. You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has won.
[time=1353] You've got to share it. All the wondrous things that God has done. You've got to tell it. You've got to tell it. Tell it.
[time=1370] That is an exciting song that calls us to be evangelist wherever we are to tell people about Jesus Christ. I hope that this day will be a great encouragement to you that you're going to determine in your heart that today I'm going to tell at least one person about Jesus Christ. If not today, surely this week.
[time=1391] We have coming as a special guest two weeks from today, Dr. Wendell Kempton, who is the President of ABWE Association of Baptist for World Evangelism. He's a tremendous man of God, an effective speaker, and I know you'll want to join us just two weeks from today as he ministers to us.
[time=1411] We have now to sing for us, Lenna Peterson, and after Lenna sings a good old familiar hymn, Trust and Obey, our guest for the day, Mr. Ron Susick, is going to come and proclaim God's word to us. Prepare your hearts as Lenna sings, Trust and Obey.
[time=1441] With the wand in which I hope his word, but a glory he sheds to the world. While we do his good word, he abides with us to you, and with all you'll just stand over.
[time=1471] Trust and Obey, it is no other way to be happy with Jesus, but to trust and honor.
[time=1492] But we never can call the delights of his love, until the autumn we lay, for the favor he shows, and the joy he bays to us.
[time=1520] Work for them who will just stand over.
[time=1529] Then when our ships wait, we will say that his feet, though we'll walk by his side in the wind.
[time=1547] But he says we will do, where he sends we will go, and never fear only a trust and Obey.
[time=1564] Trust and Obey, it is no other way to be happy with Jesus.
[time=1580] But to trust and honor.
[time=1588] Trust and Obey, oh there's no other way to be happy in Jesus.
[time=1607] But to trust and honor.
[time=1628] Shall we pray together?
[time=1631] Father, we thank you for those powerful words so well sung.
[time=1636] We pray that Thy Holy Spirit will stir them deeply in our being.
[time=1642] As we go through the events of life that many times bring us to where Job was, where we would almost dare to begin to question you.
[time=1653] And remind us of your words to so many men in the past.
[time=1658] We are the clay, you are the potter. We have no right to say to the potter, what are you doing?
[time=1665] Grant to us that ability to trust and obey.
[time=1670] I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
[time=1675] Well it's good to see all of you who are wonderfully gracious and not angry with me for being a bit longer in the previous service and making it a very tight squeeze for you to get by all the people that were leaving and to be here now.
[time=1690] So thank you for your graciousness and kindness and it's good to be here again.
[time=1697] My wife and I are always spoiled when we're here.
[time=1700] We really enjoyed our time last summer and in fact Diane said as I was leaving home yesterday, please say hi to everyone.
[time=1707] So hi to everyone from Diane.
[time=1710] And by the way, Rick Hawks is a special person to me and I only learned today that his wife's maiden name was Bird and that Miss Bird married Rick Hawk.
[time=1727] And now I'm beginning to understand why they're flighty people.
[time=1732] I had to get that out of my system before trying to preach, you understand that.
[time=1737] But tonight, by the way, I'm going to be speaking on how to escape the prisons of your mind.
[time=1744] We all suffer battles with inferior feelings, some unnatural superior feelings.
[time=1751] We all fight battles and inner wars with our minds and I want to bring a message entitled "How to Escape the Prisons of your Mind" and I really hope that you'll plan to be here for that tonight.
[time=1765] Now this morning, would you join me please in your Bible in the book of Colossians chapter one.
[time=1771] Colossians chapter one and I'm going to preach this message in reverse today.
[time=1777] I'm going to begin with the end of the message first.
[time=1781] Then I'm going to go back and we're going to work our way back to the end.
[time=1786] Now I'm doing that because I read books that way.
[time=1789] I'll often read the last chapter first to find out what the author concluded.
[time=1793] Then I go back to find out how he got to that conclusion and that helps me remember the book.
[time=1798] And so I'm going to begin this morning with the conclusion of the message.
[time=1803] Then we're going to go back and find out how the Apostle Paul got to this great conclusion.
[time=1809] Now the end of the message.
[time=1812] Colossians chapter one, verse 18, I'm reading from the new international version.
[time=1819] Speaking of Christ, and he is the head of the body, the church.
[time=1826] He is the beginning and the first born from among the dead so that in everything he might have supremacy or total control.
[time=1839] Now think that through.
[time=1841] Jesus is the head of the church, the first born from among the dead,
[time=1847] that in all things, the attitudes of your heart, the thoughts of your mind, the decisions of your life,
[time=1856] who you marry, where you go to college, where you work, how long you work there,
[time=1862] that in all things he might have total control.
[time=1869] Now if you're a non-Christian or if you're a carnal Christian, you may be having a negative response to that.
[time=1878] In your heart you may be thinking, "Now wait a minute.
[time=1882] Didn't God give me a brain to think on my own?" Well, yes he did.
[time=1889] But I want you to think about that for a moment.
[time=1892] What does it mean for Christ to be the head of the body, the head of your life?
[time=1898] Some years ago I was speaking at a camp for the handicapped and many of the people there suffered from cerebral palsy,
[time=1907] which is damage to the motor part of the brain.
[time=1910] Now they had fine minds, many of them had masters and one man held two doctorates in philosophy.
[time=1918] There is nothing wrong with their reasoning abilities, but because there is damage to the motor part of the brain,
[time=1926] their bodies would writhe in spasms.
[time=1929] They couldn't control the movement of their arms or some couldn't even speak.
[time=1935] Now your brain right now is sending signals to your nerves and muscles that are racing between 300 and 3000 miles an hour.
[time=1946] The reason you're able to sit right now is because your brain is commanding your body.
[time=1953] These people have damage to the motor part of their brain and so their coordination is gone because the brain cannot get the signals out to the nerves and to the muscles.
[time=1964] And so their bodies writhe and there is really no nice way to say it.
[time=1969] Their bodies are out of control.
[time=1972] There is lack of coordination.
[time=1975] Why?
[time=1976] Because the brain cannot get its commands to the body.
[time=1979] Now listen carefully.
[time=1982] I want to make three statements and you may not agree.
[time=1987] First of all, I am convinced that every major problem we have in a church whereby there is a church split,
[time=1996] it comes inevitably because someone or some people are refusing to take orders from the head of the church, Jesus Christ.
[time=2007] Now let me move closer home.
[time=2010] I believe that every marital conflict bar none is rooted in one person or both persons refusing to take orders from the head of the church.
[time=2027] Jesus Christ in their attitudes and actions and decisions towards each other.
[time=2033] Now you may think Ron, you don't understand my situation.
[time=2037] Well, I've been in the ministry now nearly 20 years and I am within my own self sure that I'm right in saying every marital conflict bar none is rooted in how well you are receiving and responding to orders from the head of the church, Jesus Christ.
[time=2059] Now I'm going to touch on a sacred calf.
[time=2064] I am not a psychiatrist although I at one time gave serious thought to being a psychoanalyst and I read in the field as much as I can of counseling and psychology.
[time=2078] But I am ready to say this, I personally am convinced that apart from brain damage, every inner war that you face, every emotional conflict, every unresolved psychosomatic symptom, whatever it may be, is all rooted in your ability or refusal of ability
[time=2104] to respond to the command center of the universe and your life, Jesus Christ.
[time=2112] Jesus Christ came to become the head of the body and he doesn't command the body, the church worldwide as a massive blob, he commands the church worldwide and we may be talking upwards to a billion people by commanding each individual personally.
[time=2133] And I believe that any Christian anywhere in the world who is not living in surrender to the head of the church Jesus Christ throws the body of Christ worldwide into a sad spasm.
[time=2154] That's how important you are to the body of Christ worldwide.
[time=2160] Now how can the Apostle Paul come to this incredible conclusion that Christ wants to be the head of your life?
[time=2168] That Christ expects you as Paul said to bring every thought into captivity to him, that Christ expects you to bring every emotion into captivity to him.
[time=2180] Christ expects you to bring every attitude, every decision into surrender to him.
[time=2186] What right does Christ have to have that kind of awesome authority over your life?
[time=2194] Let's go back to verses 12 or rather verses 13 and 14, they read this way speaking of God.
[time=2202] For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=2214] Pause there. In the world there are only two kingdoms.
[time=2221] There is the kingdom of darkness under the authority of Satan and there is the kingdom of the Son of God under the authority of God himself.
[time=2232] And every single person in the world falls into one kingdom or the other.
[time=2238] You are either serving the kingdom of darkness or you are serving the kingdom of the Son of God. Now listen carefully.
[time=2245] The secular humanist tells us there is a third kingdom called the kingdom of man whereby you do your own thing independent of God and Satan.
[time=2255] There is no third kingdom. Every thought of your mind, every attitude of your heart, every emotion, every decision, everything you do will either serve the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom of the Son of God, one of the other.
[time=2276] To picture that in your mind picture the city of Berlin, Germany which today is divided by a wall.
[time=2285] I am sensitive about that wall because I have relatives who are locked in communist Berlin under the deadly impact of atheistic communism.
[time=2296] My own family heritage has been destroyed by that ruthless takeover.
[time=2302] I probably could not find my family records in a small town where my grandfather was raised because of the destructiveness of that war.
[time=2311] I would love if someone could blow that wall away and my relatives could rush to free Berlin and we could communicate again.
[time=2320] While that is not possible in Berlin, Germany today, that is a good picture of the problems on planet earth.
[time=2329] There is a wall dividing humanity.
[time=2333] One side of that wall is the kingdom of darkness under Satan.
[time=2338] The other side of that wall is the kingdom of the Son of God, under God.
[time=2344] And there is no way humanly possible for any human to get over, under, around, or through that wall.
[time=2356] And every person ever born in the history of the world has been born into the kingdom of darkness automatically, according to the Bible.
[time=2368] And proven by our lifestyles as our sin nature lives out as we grow.
[time=2375] There is no world religion that can scale the wall.
[time=2383] There is only one way for you to get from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God.
[time=2390] And that is, and you'll have to excuse the crudity of this illustration through one hole that was blown in that wall.
[time=2401] And that hole was blown there by Jesus Christ when he shed his body and blood in payment for the fact that you and I were born into the kingdom of darkness
[time=2412] and for the sins that we committed while in that kingdom.
[time=2417] He shed his body, shed his blood in payment for our condition that we can now pass by faith out of the kingdom of darkness
[time=2427] and enter into the kingdom of the Son of God, passing through that one and only hole in the wall, over which reads the words,
[time=2437] "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes unto the Father but by me."
[time=2445] And you pass through the body and blood of Christ and the forgiveness of God and by faith you enter the kingdom of the Son of God.
[time=2453] Now, listen carefully.
[time=2456] There is only one thing in all the world that can hold you in the kingdom of darkness.
[time=2464] It is not Satan.
[time=2466] It is not the world.
[time=2468] It is not the way you are raised.
[time=2470] It is not your religion.
[time=2472] It is your will.
[time=2475] There is a hole in the wall.
[time=2477] The blood of Christ has been shed.
[time=2479] The body has been broken.
[time=2481] The forgiveness of God has been extended.
[time=2484] You can pass freely through that hole now and enter the kingdom of the Son of God.
[time=2491] The first reason why Christ has the right to command every area of your life is that he shed his body and blood to get you out of the kingdom of darkness
[time=2501] and into the kingdom of the Son of God.
[time=2504] Raisin number two, verse 15, "He is the image of the invisible God."
[time=2512] God, who is invisible, no man has ever seen him.
[time=2516] He is spirit, has done all that he can to reveal himself to you so that in your span of life on earth you can be absolutely sure that you have found the real
[time=2530] and living God.
[time=2533] First of all, God has revealed his power and Godhead in the creation of infinite space and it is all here to reveal himself to you.
[time=2548] God has revealed his handiwork in the firmament.
[time=2552] Every time you see a sunset, you see the beauty of God.
[time=2556] Every time you look into infinite space, you see the illustration of God's omnipresence.
[time=2563] Every time you see the power of atomic explosion, you see an illustration of God's omnipotence, his all power.
[time=2575] But God wanted to be so sure that you did not go through life and miss knowing the real God.
[time=2584] No possible mistakes, no chance of ending up in a false religion, a false cult.
[time=2591] God wanted to be so sure that you had every possible chance to know him properly.
[time=2598] He stepped on this planet in a human body, the body of Jesus of Nazareth, and Jesus of Nazareth was the eternal sovereign invisible God living in a human body.
[time=2616] That's why Jesus said, "I and the Father are one. If you're looking at me, you're looking at the Father. Don't be afraid of me. I did not come to condemn you. I came to save you."
[time=2629] Jesus was God walking on this earth.
[time=2636] Anything you need to know about the invisible God, you can know by reading the Gospels, the life of Christ. He was God.
[time=2643] We know, for example, that God has a deep personal love for people.
[time=2649] We see Jesus, who is God, in the middle of a very busy day, a tremendous crowd had gathered, and the disciples saw his fatigue.
[time=2659] They were concerned for his sake, and they began to shoot children away, and Jesus stopped everything.
[time=2665] Stopped everything in motion for a child to come over, sat him on his knee, and said, "Allow the children to come unto me of such as the kingdom of God."
[time=2677] We also know that God will have absolutely nothing at all to do with sin.
[time=2683] Don't ever try to justify divorce, remarriage, lying, cheating, stealing, whatever you may be trying to cover up or justify in your life.
[time=2695] I did it because I was offended, and I had a right to do it, and all the foolish reasoning we engage in don't ever do it.
[time=2703] Jesus, who was God, was confronted by a woman taken in adultery. They said, "What are we going to do?"
[time=2712] Jesus did not say to that woman, "Go and sin only when you need a meaningful relationship."
[time=2720] As many modern thinkers listening to the doctrines of demons are telling people today.
[time=2728] Jesus said to that woman an eternal absolute of God that he brought from eternity when he looked into her eyes and said, "Go and sin no more."
[time=2743] That is an eternal absolute from the heart of God. He'll never change.
[time=2750] But we also know that while God will never compromise with your inner mind, he loves you enough to die for it because we see Jesus God hanging on a cross.
[time=2764] With those at his feet laughing, scoffing, spitting, sneering, damning, doubting, and they're hung Jesus saying, "I love you."
[time=2779] We know all we need to know about God for this life by the study of the life of Jesus because Jesus was God walking on earth in a human body.
[time=2792] That's the second reason why he has the right to command your life and mind. He was God revealing himself to you in every way possible.
[time=2799] The third reason, verse 15, Christ is the first born over all creation.
[time=2807] I was leaving my home one day and an older couple were standing on my doorstep and they wanted to talk and I could tell immediately what cult they were from.
[time=2817] And so I said, "I'm in a hurry. We've got to get to the point quickly." I said, "I have a feeling that you're going to say to me, would you turn to Colossians 1-15?" They beamed and said, "Yes." I said, "Fine, would you turn there and read it?" They did quickly.
[time=2832] I said, "Now I have a feeling you're going to tell me that the word first born, listen carefully, means time of creation."
[time=2841] And that Jesus was the first thing in time that God created and then Jesus having been created as a little God then created everything else.
[time=2854] And they said, "Yes." I said, "Wrong."
[time=2860] The Greek word first born can mean time of creation, but it also means position over creation. You got those two words, time or position.
[time=2874] This verse cannot refer to time. Jesus was never created. He as sovereign God eternal holds the highest first born position over all that he created.
[time=2889] Now how do we know that it means that? And by the way, if it doesn't, if it means that Jesus was the first thing in time that God created, then Christianity falls to shambles and we are no more than another world religion or cult.
[time=2903] Jesus must be seen as eternal God. Why? Well, I'm going to play a game with you.
[time=2913] How many here, and don't be afraid to respond, believe that the Bible is sacred knowledge revealed by God. Raise your hands.
[time=2923] All right, that's almost all of it. How many here won't raise your hand no matter what I said? Few of you too. How many here believe that science is sacred knowledge revealed by God? Raise your hands.
[time=2936] Uh oh, we got a few. Well, I'm with a few of you. And here's why.
[time=2943] Anything you see in life that man has not distorted by sin is sacred knowledge revealed by God to reveal God. The universe was made by God. How do you not call that sacred?
[time=2957] The knowledge of the universe is revealing what? According to Romans 1, revealing the Godhead bodily. You're seeing the Godhead in the universe. Oh, my friend, that makes it sacred. Science, whether it knows it or not, is sacred revelation of God.
[time=2976] Now, it's not the same revelation as the Bible. The Bible is a different part of revelation, but it is all divine revelation. Now, listen carefully.
[time=2986] When science or scientists catch up to the Bible, science and the Bible will agree perfectly. Now, there are some areas where they have already agreed.
[time=3003] For example, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and I'm not advanced in science, so I have to confess that I know a lot more about thermodynamics than I know about thermodynamics.
[time=3017] However, what I do understand of thermodynamics is that matter and energy cannot create itself nor destroy itself. The universe could not get here on its own. It cannot leave on its own.
[time=3033] You can change matter from one form to another, matter to energy, heat, heat, energy, matter, but you cannot create or destroy. It is telling us that science has never created one thing in the history of the world.
[time=3046] It discovers and develops what has already been created, but it never creates.
[time=3054] For Jesus to have been the Creator, and we know that by the next phrase in verse 16, which reads this way, for by him all things were created, for him to be the Creator, he could never have been created.
[time=3070] First, science tells us that, and science has finally, after thousands of years, caught up to what the Bible said 2,000 years ago, when in Hebrews 11-3 we read, that things which are made were not made by things which do appear. The Bible and the science agree.
[time=3092] Science tells us something created cannot create. The Bible tells us something created cannot create. For Jesus to have created all things, he himself could never have been created.
[time=3106] Now what is that saying? That's big theology. What does that mean to you when the rubber meets the road? Simply this. Jesus as God holds the highest position over all things that he created.
[time=3122] If you, my friend, are not living in total surrender to Jesus Christ day by day, you are missing the whole reason for which you were created. You're out of step with the whole universe. You've missed it all.
[time=3141] I don't care how intelligent you are. I don't care how great you are in your occupation. It makes no difference. You're out of step with all of existence.
[time=3153] Now the next two reasons are born out of that reason. The next two reasons why Christ has the right to command your life in mind. Verse 16 reads this way, "For by him all things were created, things in heaven and earth, visible, invisible, thrones, powers, rulers or authorities, all things now watched the next two prepositions.
[time=3177] All things were created by him and for him. He is the proposer, the mastermind of all things, as well as the purpose. He's the reason you're here. He is the way you got here. He is the reason you're here."
[time=3197] Now, you might be saying, "Ron, you've been out of college too long. Don't you know that we are ooze, that ooze out of ooze and solidified, and now we're oozing back into ooze? Don't you know that we came out of a lineage of apes?"
[time=3214] Now, my friend, if you really believe that I would be hesitant to argue with you because I'm sure you know your ancestors better than I do. But the Bible is trying to tell you that Jesus masterminded your very being. You are here by him and for him.
[time=3233] Well, my friend, you're only fulfilling that purpose of existence as you are bringing every thought into captivity, every emotion into captivity, every decision into captivity and conformity to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3247] If you're not doing that, you're absolutely out of step with all of life. You've missed it. That's why you're having a lot of problems finding yourself, a lot of problems putting life together.
[time=3258] The next reason why he has the right to command your life in mind, verse 17, he is before all things. Now, that's kind of poor English. Why doesn't the Bible say he was before all things?
[time=3271] Why does the Bible say he is before all things? Well, it may be poor English, but it's good theology. When you're eternal, there is no was. You know what I mean? You with me?
[time=3285] Jesus is before the foundation of the world right now. Jesus is in this meeting right now. Jesus is at the end of the universe right now.
[time=3297] All right, now, what does that mean to you? That's big theology. What does that mean to you as shoe leather right now?
[time=3304] I had a young couple come to me a little over a year ago and they were just drained pale as they held in their arms a baby that was born with the veins and arteries to the heart all reversed.
[time=3318] And the doctor said very few children can ever survive the operation and the operation must be done after the child is at least a year of age if the child can survive the year.
[time=3331] And there stood those parents and I've never seen such hurt and fear as in that young beautiful mother who held that baby and said, "I can't let him die."
[time=3344] What do you say then? I turned them to this very verse and I put my arms around each of them and I said, "Now listen to me with both ears and hear me in the bottom of your souls."
[time=3358] Jesus is at the point of conception right now. Jesus is in the pregnancy. Jesus is in that development of the heart.
[time=3369] Jesus is at the beginning of the operation. He is in the middle of it. He is at the end of it right now. Trust Jesus.
[time=3380] Will you? And they said, "Yes." And when they did, you could see the peace take command.
[time=3389] I'm here to tell you that that young couple did come through that operation and by the grace of Christ, that child is alive today.
[time=3401] Whether the child lived or died, they had committed themselves to believe Jesus Christ. That's what it means to believe in Christ, making him the absolute command center of your life.
[time=3417] Then the final reason that Christ has the right to command your life and mind, verse 17 continues and...
