[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] (bells ringing) - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=89] Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=93] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=122] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=130] - Good morning, and welcome to this morning worship service
[time=136] at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=139] This is the second worship service of the day, and we had a tremendous crowd here for the first hour, and we were so thrilled and encouraged by Dr. Wendell Kempton, our speaker for today.
[time=150] Dr. Kempton is the President and the Leader of the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=157] He is a man who is gifted of God in the area of communicating God's word, and we're looking forward to hearing from him today.
[time=165] But now to prepare our hearts, in the lead us in worship, our choir is going to sing for us under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=174] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=428] - I trust that this morning you could sing along with the choir that you know that your redeemer lives because Jesus Christ lives within your heart.
[time=438] That is a great anthem of praise this morning, a testimony of lips.
[time=443] And I have a friend with me this morning who's going to share a testimony out of his life.
[time=448] This is Dick Godfrey.
[time=449] Dick happens to have a profession that all of you have heard about.
[time=453] He is a Kirby Vacuum Cleaner Salesman.
[time=457] In the early hour I asked all the people to raise their hand who've been called on by a Kirby Vacuum Cleaner Salesman and instructed the rest of them to sign up on the registration form.
[time=467] And I don't know how many cards came in, Dick, but Dick has a testimony to share with you.
[time=473] He is one of 10,000 Kirby Salesman in the world.
[time=477] He just happens to be the second most productive one of them.
[time=481] We're quite proud of that, but more than that, we're proud of the testimony he has in Christ.
[time=486] Dick, God's given you a way of blending your faith in Christ in together with your work, hasn't he?
[time=491] He sure has.
[time=492] The Bible tells us that if we trust in the Lord with all of our hearts and lean not unto our own understandings and acknowledge him in all of our ways, he'll direct our paths.
[time=501] And I try to take that as a formula for my work.
[time=503] Well, you've shared with me some exciting experiences of how that has worked out and one with an elderly lady one day after evangelism class.
[time=513] Well, my wife drugged me out here to this church about 14 months ago, I didn't want to come.
[time=518] And the Lord has blessed us tremendously ever since.
[time=520] And she even encouraged me to get into the evangelism program.
[time=524] I said, well, you can't go on Thursday nights.
[time=526] You're out of town every week.
[time=527] And somebody come up with the idea, have it on Tuesday mornings.
[time=531] And so the Lord's blessed me.
[time=533] And I had an opportunity the other day after one of the classes that we'd left to pull into a driveway and talk with an elderly lady.
[time=540] And I, after talking to her, I asked her if she'd reached the place in her spiritual life where she'd know for a certain and if she was going to die tonight, she would go to heaven.
[time=548] And she shared with me that she didn't think anybody could really know that.
[time=552] And I told her about the discovery that I had made in line in my life and the discovery that a lot of you have made.
[time=557] And I told her that I wanted to share with her the greatest story that was ever told about the greatest man that ever lived.
[time=563] And she said that I could.
[time=564] And she prayed with me when we were through and accepted Christ into her life.
[time=569] If I wasn't parked in the driveway, I would have flown home.
[time=572] We're glad that you landed safely back here to share that with us.
[time=577] But it's so thrilling to know that God uses people right in the walk of their life to share the life-changing power of Christ.
[time=584] It's not something that just happens on a Sunday morning in an auditorium.
[time=588] But Christ said, you shall be witnesses every day.
[time=592] We're thankful for that word of testimony.
[time=595] And yet you've had some other experiences, too, haven't you?
[time=598] I was in a home about a week and a half ago, and I got into the home, and after talking to them, I tried to let them know in some way that I'm a Christian.
[time=606] And this lady said, well, what church are you with?
[time=608] And I said, I'm with the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, and I was happy that I could say that.
[time=613] And she said, my, my, she said, I didn't think I would ever get the opportunity to meet anyone from the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=620] And she wanted to touch me.
[time=622] [LAUGHTER] And I shared with her about the praise that we gather in all the homes that I get into.
[time=631] I've heard about the Bible hour years before I ever came to this church.
[time=636] And I shared about the praise that we get from all over.
[time=639] But I said to her that maybe the Lord might speak to her about maybe another way that she could support the Bible hour through her finances.
[time=647] And she shared with me that she wasn't going to think about it anymore or she wasn't going to pray it out about it anymore.
[time=652] She was just going to send something this week.
[time=654] She'd thought about it long enough.
[time=656] And I would suggest to anyone here or anyone out there that if you've been thinking about it, just stop thinking about it and go ahead and do it.
[time=664] And the Lord will bless you.
[time=665] Now Dick is no longer with Kirby.
[time=667] He's joined our staff as minister.
[time=669] [LAUGHTER] That's not true.
[time=671] But we're thankful for your sensitivity to God and to His Word.
[time=674] And you're still growing as a Christian.
[time=676] I'm still growing.
[time=677] But we're thankful God's doing some great things in your life, isn't he?
[time=681] He sure is.
[time=682] And after leaving there and discussing the problem of finances with her about the Bible hour, the Lord spoke to me.
[time=688] And I spoke to my wife.
[time=690] And we decided that maybe we could be a little bit more part of the program.
[time=693] And I have a check in my pocket today for the Bible hour.
[time=696] And I can say, if you've been thinking about it, don't put it off.
[time=699] Go ahead and do it.
[time=700] The Lord will bless you.
[time=701] Thank you, Dick.
[time=702] You remind me of the passage in 2 Corinthians, the 8th, chapter in the 5th verse where it says, "First they gave their lives to Christ, and then they gave their gifts." I'm thankful that your life's given to Christ and for your testimony today.
[time=716] Lord bless you.
[time=716] Thank you, Dick.
[time=718] We're thrilled as a congregation to have people who give of their time, of their talent, and of their treasure to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=727] You know, we do not give to a church or to a television ministry, we give to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=733] First of all, we give by giving Him our heart.
[time=737] Then we follow by giving Him the talent that we have.
[time=740] And we have two very talented people who've dedicated that to serving Jesus Christ.
[time=745] Keith Brodygan, and soon-to-be star of Brodygan, but for today, star in our world, have come to sing for us a song of praise.
[time=753] [MUSIC]
[time=756] Amazing grace will always be my son of grace.
[time=770] For it was grace that put my liberty.
[time=779] I'll never know just why he came to love me so.
[time=789] He looked beyond my fault and saw my need.
[time=801] I shall forever lift my eyes to Calvary,
[time=812] to thee the cross where Jesus died for me.
[time=823] How marvelous the grace that called my fault is so.
[time=836] He looked beyond my fault and saw my need.
[time=849] I shall forever lift my eyes to Calvary,
[time=861] to thee the cross where Jesus died for me.
[time=873] How marvelous the grace that called my fault is so.
[time=888] He looked beyond my fault and saw my need.
[time=901] Hello, and I trust that you're having a good day,
[time=915] and we're thankful that you've joined us today in the Bible hour.
[time=920] We have a special guest with us this morning, Dr. Wendell Kenton.
[time=924] We'll be telling you a little bit about him in a moment, but I want to welcome back my friend Don Kruger, who was away last week, holding evangelistic meetings in Pennsylvania.
[time=934] Don, how were those meetings?
[time=936] Pastor Rick, they were tremendous.
[time=938] We had a good time.
[time=939] It was at the Bible Fellowship Church in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
[time=942] And people were saved, and it was just a blessed time.
[time=945] My brother and I get together once in the spring and once in the fall for evangelistic meetings, we used to do this years ago.
[time=951] We were together for almost 10 years, and now we get together every spring and every fall.
[time=956] It was really tremendous.
[time=958] Well, I'm glad to hear that report, but I'm more thankful that you're back with us.
[time=962] We missed you last week and are thankful that you're with us today.
[time=966] And we're also thankful for our many Bible hour viewers who are with us today.
[time=971] Although we haven't met all of you personally, we rejoice every time we hear from you through the mail.
[time=977] I just want to encourage you to write in during these days.
[time=980] Many of you have written, and then we appreciate that, and we would like you to continue to do that.
[time=984] Pastor Rick is encouraged when we receive letters that tell us that you're praying for us and that you're behind us financially.
[time=992] We really appreciate it.
[time=993] Please continue to write those letters.
[time=995] And if you would write us today, write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1003] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1007] And if you would like, we'd like you to request this little booklet entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=1014] From time to time, we offer different pieces of literature to our family and the television audience.
[time=1020] And this has been one of the most popular booklets that we've ever sent out.
[time=1025] As you know, it's written by one of our staff members, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1029] Ken is a licensed psychologist.
[time=1032] He's been educated.
[time=1033] He has a doctor's degree from a Christian school of counseling.
[time=1037] The Narrowmore School called Rosemead Graduate School of Psychology.
[time=1041] Inside the booklet, there are many, many helpful topics.
[time=1045] One of them is, in everything, give thanks.
[time=1048] That's a good slogan for us to think about during these Thanksgiving days.
[time=1053] To be thankful, under God, we'd like to send this to you if you would just write to us and request this booklet.
[time=1060] Write to the Bible Hour box, 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1068] Once again, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1072] Pastor Rick, many of our people who have been writing in about this booklet have been mentioning how that they don't only understand it.
[time=1078] It's easily understood, but that it's very, very practical.
[time=1081] And so I appreciate those letters that people have told us that it is an understandable and practical book.
[time=1087] And if you haven't written, please do.
[time=1090] Remedies for negative thinking.
[time=1092] It's a tremendous little book.
[time=1093] And we'd love to send it to you today.
[time=1095] It's been an encouragement to many, many people.
[time=1098] And I know it would be, to your life also.
[time=1102] Today our special pulpit guest is Dr. Wendell Kempton.
[time=1105] We're just so glad to have him here.
[time=1107] Rick, tell us something about Dr. Kempton.
[time=1109] Well, Dr. Kempton has been here before for a special enrichment conference for missionaries that we hosted way back in 1979.
[time=1118] That was the first opportunity I had to hear him speak.
[time=1122] And he thoroughly encouraged and challenged my heart and mind.
[time=1126] It was a tremendous time of enrichment, not just for the missionaries, but for me also.
[time=1131] And then Don this morning, as I was in the building earlier, several of our people, such as Keith Roddigan, who was at Grand Rapids Baptist College in Seminary.
[time=1140] Keith mentioned that he or Dr. Kempton speak there.
[time=1143] And it was really an encouraging and special time.
[time=1146] And so we're anxious to get back to the service right now so that we can hear Dr. Kempton's message.
[time=1152] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1155] We'd love to share God's word with you.
[time=1158] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=1159] If we could send you this booklet, Remedies for Negative Thinking, write to us today.
[time=1164] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1170] 46-815. God bless you, and have a good day.
[time=1192] And you are my everything, my highest joy and price.
[time=1204] You meet my needs in every way, with grace that set is false.
[time=1219] For you are my everything, my food and drink today.
[time=1230] You need to boast and meddle-screen, and guide in a special way.
[time=1244] Since I am your own precious sheep, you watch me even when I see.
[time=1256] You have become my all in all.
[time=1262] You always lift me when I fall.
[time=1268] Lord, you are my everything, my highest joy and price.
[time=1281] You meet my needs in every way, with grace that set is false.
[time=1298] Lord, you are my everything, my highest joy and price.
[time=1324] You meet my needs in every way, with grace that set is false.
[time=1339] Lord, you are my everything, my shelter and huge friend.
[time=1350] You are my great inheritance, whose blessings never end.
[time=1364] You build me with love in the night.
[time=1369] You fill me with complete delight.
[time=1375] Your presence fills my heart with joy, which nothing ever can destroy.
[time=1387] Lord, you are my everything, my highest joy and price.
[time=1403] You meet my needs in every way, with grace that set is false.
[time=1416] Lord, you are my everything.
[time=1436] The process of the Christian life is a principle of replacement, replacing ourselves in every
[time=1443] area of our life with Jesus Christ, till we come to the point that we can sing, Lord, you are my everything.
[time=1451] These days we have been talking a great deal about the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[time=1457] I hope that today you know I am a Savior.
[time=1460] If not, this could be the day that you could make that decision.
[time=1464] Then as Savior, you would move on to allowing Him to be the Lord of your life.
[time=1469] Keith Brodygan comes now to sing for us a song entitled, "The End of the Road."
[time=1499] Sweet relief from all care will be waiting with her when I come to the end of the road.
[time=1516] When the long days enter the journey's oar, I shall enter that blessed road, and the
[time=1536] Savior I love will be waiting for me when I come to the end of the road.
[time=1561] When I come to the end of the road, and the foes that be set, God will make me forget.
[time=1585] I come to the end of the road, just a kate open wide, and a friend by my side, when I come
[time=1604] to the end of the road, that is all that I ask, as a crown for my task, when I come
[time=1622] to the end of the road, and the long days enter the journey's oar, I shall enter that blessed
[time=1641] road, and the Savior I love will be waiting for me.
[time=1662] When I come to the end of the road.
[time=1686] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1688] We have as our speaker today Dr. Wendell Kenton.
[time=1691] Dr. Kenton is the president and the leader of the Association of Baptists for World
[time=1697] Evangelism.
[time=1698] It's been our delight to meet him earlier this morning, he's been here before, he reminds
[time=1704] me of the verse in John where it says of the Lord Jesus Christ that we beheld His glory.
[time=1710] Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=1715] I've met many, many men, capable of proclaiming the truth.
[time=1720] Dr. Kenton is one of those men, but he also possesses that other quality of grace.
[time=1726] He's a man who knows of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and its characteristic of his walk.
[time=1732] Dr. Kenton, we're delighted that you're with us today.
[time=1735] We praise God for your coming and rejoice that you're with us.
[time=1740] Thank you very much, Pastor Rick.
[time=1743] I'd like for you to take your Bibles this morning and turn to Hebrews, the 11th chapter, one
[time=1749] of the most famous chapters in all of the Bible.
[time=1754] While you're turning to that portion of Scripture that's found in the New Testament, I want to tell you of a phone call that I receive back in the month of May of this year.
[time=1765] An attorney friend of mine by the name of Jim was calling from Seattle.
[time=1770] He had just arrived back from a two-and-a-half-hour luncheon.
[time=1774] He was all excited, and since he knew that I have some kind of a ministry toward the
[time=1780] world, he said to me, he said, "Wendal," he said, "I had a terrific opportunity to listen
[time=1788] to a lecture today, and I want to share it with you." We had lunch together with all the city leaders, and then he said, "George Gallup of the Gallup
[time=1800] Polls got up and lectured an hour and a half on the five greatest problems confronting
[time=1807] the world today." And Jim said to me, "I thought you'd be interested in knowing what they were." And I said, "I sure am," and he said, "Please write them down." So I begin to record them, number one, according to George Gallup, political insensitivity.
[time=1826] And that is so true, because if peoples of the world are not sensitive to their leadership,
[time=1833] it's not too long that they lose their respect.
[time=1837] And without the respect, the leaders are not able to really move their countries in the
[time=1844] direction which they want them to go.
[time=1847] And then he said, "The second greatest problem facing the world today is drugs."
[time=1854] And that is a truism.
[time=1856] I personally gave five years of my life, along with my wife, to help those who had that particular
[time=1864] problem in their life.
[time=1866] And since that time, it increases every day.
[time=1870] Whether you are in Hong Kong or in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the drug seen today is the number
[time=1877] two problem that faces our world.
[time=1881] And then number three, alcoholism.
[time=1884] There are sections of the world where there is just about a constant problem of anebriation.
[time=1893] And there are many ills that follow that particular disease of alcoholism.
[time=1904] Number four, and listen to this one, it's nearly unbelievable.
[time=1908] But according to George Gallup, he said, "The number four problem facing the world today
[time=1915] is the lack of biblical knowledge." You see, dear folks, there's something about the Bible and the knowledge of the Bible that
[time=1925] brings stability and strength and confidence.
[time=1931] For if you amass enough Bible knowledge, you're finally going to be introduced to a person
[time=1937] called the Lord Jesus Christ, who was the greatest man that ever lived in all of world
[time=1944] history and human history.
[time=1947] And then he said, number five, the severe decline of moral and ethical principles.
[time=1956] Those are five great problems.
[time=1959] George Gallup says they're the greatest that face the world today.
[time=1965] And there are things that seem to be impossible to cope with.
[time=1971] That's the reason why I've chosen for my topic this morning.
[time=1976] The one thing that is impossible with God, I've heard it said that all things are possible
[time=1983] with God.
[time=1984] That is not true.
[time=1987] God is limited in certain ways and today we're going to discuss with you.
[time=1993] In fact, it's not going to take just but a few moments.
[time=1997] And you're going to find the one thing that is impossible with God.
[time=2004] Some of our hypnology and some of the choruses that we sing about all things are possible.
[time=2011] That's not true.
[time=2013] All things are not possible with God.
[time=2017] And so if you would please take your Bibles and look down at the most famous chapter in
[time=2023] the book of Hebrews, we'll immediately find out that one thing that is impossible with
[time=2030] God, just by the simple reading of the text.
[time=2036] We take a slice from Hebrews 11 chapter and look at verse 6 where it says, "But without
[time=2045] faith it is impossible." I repeat, "But without faith it is impossible to please him, for he that cometh to God must
[time=2059] believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
[time=2068] So already we know what the answer is to the text.
[time=2073] The one thing that is impossible with God is that there is no way that we can please
[time=2080] God unless we have faith.
[time=2085] Now there are three things that are involved with faith, or three things about faith that
[time=2091] I'd like to share with you this morning.
[time=2094] First of all, faith is an invisible.
[time=2098] No one has ever seen faith.
[time=2102] And yet it is of extreme importance.
[time=2107] Secondly, faith is an intangible.
[time=2112] No one has ever reached out and grabbed a hold of faith.
[time=2117] But yet faith to the Christian is that which must grab a hold of him.
[time=2124] Thirdly, faith must be inculcated.
[time=2131] For without faith there is no way we can please God.
[time=2138] Now the Bible clearly speaks about three kinds of faith, each of which have subpoints under
[time=2146] them.
[time=2148] The first kind of faith that is taught about in the Bible is saving faith.
[time=2154] You see the word salvation is a very important word to world history.
[time=2161] And the people today throughout the world, they need to be saved.
[time=2167] A lot of people think that they can be saved through being baptized or through being a member
[time=2173] of a particular denominational church.
[time=2176] That is not true.
[time=2177] That is not spoken of any place throughout the entirety of the Scriptures.
[time=2183] However, the Bible clearly speaks that no man has ever become eternally linked to God
[time=2191] without saving faith.
[time=2196] Let me just share it with you this way.
[time=2199] Paul wrote the words for, "By grace are ye saved through faith."
[time=2205] And that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.
[time=2213] You can go any place in the world.
[time=2215] And if you meet another Christian, you're going to find that he got saved the same way
[time=2221] you got saved and got saved the same way everyone else got saved by faith.
[time=2229] The Bible speaks of saving faith.
[time=2233] Secondly, the Bible speaks about living faith.
[time=2239] You see, the motor to the Christian life is faith.
[time=2243] The Christian life will not go down very far, go down the road very far, unless there is
[time=2251] that motor called faith in your life and mine.
[time=2255] In fact, the Christian life is operative on the principle of faith.
[time=2262] Now, if you have your Bibles there, just turn, if you would, back to Hebrews, the tenth chapter.
[time=2270] And you'll just see one little phrase there that's very important.
[time=2276] Down in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 38, now it says, "Now the just shall live by faith."
[time=2289] I want to repeat to you, no one has ever lived a victorious, vivacious, virile Christian
[time=2297] life without living faith.
[time=2303] Now I have some great news for you.
[time=2305] The Bible speaks of another kind of faith, something that we very seldom speak about,
[time=2312] but it's part of the Scripture.
[time=2315] The third kind of faith is dying faith.
[time=2321] Everyone has to die.
[time=2325] Unless the rapture comes, Jesus Christ comes again, everyone is going to have to march
[time=2331] down through that road, and then all of a sudden, either expectedly or unexpectedly,
[time=2339] we're going to die.
[time=2342] Now the Bible speaks here in Hebrews 11 chapter about those who died in faith.
[time=2350] Notice, please, in verse 13, he speaks of it in this way, "These all died in faith."
[time=2359] You see, there's only two ways to die.
[time=2362] You either die outside of faith or you die in faith.
[time=2369] If you die in faith, that enables you to walk through the door into eternal life.
[time=2379] And oh, what a wonderful thing that is.
[time=2383] Be all of us, don't have to live life before, too long before we meet people who have suffered
[time=2391] the loss of loved ones.
[time=2394] And it's an amazing thing how you can go to these memorial services and funeral services
[time=2401] and immediately you know whether the person died outside of faith or if he died in faith.
[time=2410] You see, if you die in faith, there is a triumphant note because there's victory, you see, that's
[time=2418] being experienced because Jesus Christ died, was buried and rose again.
[time=2428] Then we have the assurance, those of us who have been saved by faith, that because Christ
[time=2434] lives, we also shall live.
[time=2439] Paul was speaking about the fact that Christ was resurrected from the dead.
[time=2444] For the believer in Jesus Christ, one of the most beautiful things he can ever experience
[time=2450] is to die in faith because it just opens the door into eternal life, that's what it does.
[time=2459] That's a beautiful thing to see what God has given to us in the scriptures about faith.
[time=2466] Now, if you look down there with your eyes on that verse, we want to just read a little
[time=2473] bit further, but without faith, it is impossible to please him, for he that cometh to God must
[time=2483] believe that he is.
[time=2487] I want to stop there long enough to say that there have been many definitions written about
[time=2493] faith, some of them are one sentence in length, others cover an entire paragraph.
[time=2500] I would like to give you this morning a one word definition of faith.
[time=2509] It's right here in the text, it's believe, that's the word.
[time=2514] You see, faith and belief is married in the scriptures, they're inseparable.
[time=2523] Now isn't it strange that this portion of scripture written for the early Jewish believer
[time=2531] who had accepted the Messiah?
[time=2535] There is reference to the fact that you've got to believe that God is.
[time=2545] You see, they suffered from the same thing we suffer from, Satan in his insidious methodology
[time=2553] comes throughout our Christian experience and at times, sows seeds of doubt.
[time=2563] If he can just get us to the place where we can doubt what God said, he can get us further
[time=2572] to the point where we can doubt the historicity and authenticity of the eternal existence
[time=2582] of God.
[time=2586] I want to share with you the following, the Bible does not set out to prove the existence
[time=2593] of God.
[time=2596] It rather assumes the existence of God.
[time=2604] And I, you'll notice it in Genesis, the first chapter in the beginning God.
[time=2612] But you see back then they were having problems, just like we're having problems today.
[time=2618] We're living in a world that is nearly coming unglued.
[time=2624] We're living in a world where we no longer have an anchor for our souls.
[time=2632] You know why my friends, because through humanism and secularism, they have taken the eternal
[time=2639] spirit, invisible God, and they've removed him from our way of life.
[time=2647] And it will not work, my friends.
[time=2649] You see, man has been basically created so that he could have fellowship with this invisible
[time=2656] God.
[time=2659] Israel was having problems with this.
[time=2662] There were over 3 million gods that existed during the time of Israel's history.
[time=2670] And that, my friends, can bring some confusion after all, which God is right.
[time=2676] There are so many ancient religions that preceded Christianity.
[time=2685] And Israel had every right in the world to try to find out which God was right.
[time=2691] That's the reason why in Deuteronomy Moses writing in the 6th chapter as if he wanted
[time=2697] to pick up a giant megaphone and he cries out here, "Oh, Israel, there is but one God."
[time=2710] And then over in the next chapter he writes these words.
[time=2714] Deuteronomy the 7th chapter in verse 9, "No therefore that the Lord, the Lord, the Lord
[time=2721] thy God, he is God."
[time=2728] The faithful God who keepeth covenant and mercy with those that love him and keep his
[time=2735] commandments unto a thousand generations.
[time=2739] My friends, that's what you call longevity.
[time=2742] If you have time, and I think we do this morning, let us take our Bibles and turn
[time=2751] back to a prophet called Isaiah.
[time=2755] In Isaiah the 43rd chapter there's some interesting words that's been recorded.
[time=2766] The Holy Spirit of God led Isaiah to write the following words.
[time=2772] In verse 10 it says, this is Isaiah 43 and verse 10, "Ye are my witnesses, Seth the Lord
[time=2781] Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and understand
[time=2794] that I am He, before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
[time=2803] I even am the Lord Jehovah, and beside me there is no Savior.
[time=2812] I have declared and have saved, and I have shown." Just please, if you would, over in page on chapter 45 of Isaiah, just let me read a few
[time=2828] other verses.
[time=2830] In verse 5 it says, "I am the Lord Jehovah, and there is none else.
[time=2837] There is no God beside me.
[time=2840] I girded thee, though thou hast not known me, that they may know from the rising of the
[time=2847] sun, and from the west that there is none beside me.
[time=2851] I am the Lord Jehovah, and there is none else." Notice verse 12, "I have made the earth, and created man upon it.
[time=2863] I even my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their hosts have I commanded."
[time=2873] You know, there are many arguments that result in the fact that there is a proof of a superior
[time=2880] supreme being, and I have heard some of them, and it's interesting, just recently I heard
[time=2890] a group of astrophysicists talking about the greater light that's pocketed 93 million
[time=2898] miles away.
[time=2900] It's called in today's nomenclature the sun.
[time=2906] And I wonder how in the world it got there, and the force and the energy, in fact they
[time=2916] said that in the first one second of the sun's operation, it expelled more energy in one
[time=2926] second than has been used in the entire history of mankind up till today.
[time=2935] Now I want to tell you folks how that thing got there, called the sun.
[time=2941] God used His son, the son's name was the Lord Jesus Christ, and it's accurately recorded.
[time=2948] It's a historical fact.
[time=2950] Jesus Christ spoke the greater light into existence and placed it up there, some 93 million
[time=2960] miles from us, and it's placed right where it ought to be.
[time=2966] Well, listen, my friends, we have every right in the world to understand that there are
[time=2975] not many roads to God.
[time=2978] There is only one road.
[time=2980] God did not want to confuse mankind with all of the religions, ancient and modern and
[time=2986] all of the cults.
[time=2988] He said, "There's only one way that you can get to me, and that's through my son, Jesus Christ." And in this verse, he says, "Without faith it is impossible to please him, and he that
[time=3003] comes to God must believe first of all that he is."
[time=3013] And although the Bible does not set out to prove the existence of God, I stand before
[time=3019] you today and tell you there are at least 66 good reasons why I believe in the existence
[time=3028] of God.
[time=3029] Listen to it, please.
[time=3031] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, all the way through to the book of the Revelation.
[time=3040] It's called in the Greek language, the Biblios.
[time=3044] We call it today the Bible.
[time=3046] It's a collection of 66 books, 39 in the Old Testament, 27 in the New Testament, recorded
[time=3056] over a period of some 1600 years by some 42 authors.
[time=3062] All these books divinely given to us to communicate that God loves us.
[time=3069] And there's hope for mankind through his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3074] It's the only story of redemption that exists.
[time=3079] The historicity and authenticity and the veracity of the Word of God called the Bible
[time=3086] cannot be debated.
[time=3087] In fact, just this past week, the Hebrew scholars have now released the information
[time=3093] that over the past 200 years they have thought that three men recorded Genesis.
[time=3101] Those of us who have believed the Bible literally have said for years that Moses was God's instrument
[time=3108] of recording what he wanted to be recorded in the book of Genesis.
[time=3113] Now this week they have finally put all of the information necessary in the computers.
[time=3120] And they push the button and the computer prints out one author.
[time=3129] My friends, our faith upon the existence of God is based upon the Word of God.
[time=3137] That's the reason why it's very important for you to have an association on a day-by-day basis with the Word of God.
[time=3148] Notice down in this passage of Scripture that he says, "We not only have to believe
[time=3156] that he is, but that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
[time=3166] Two things that are required of the believer.
[time=3170] I am so concerned about this particular aspect of the Christian life that is a Christian
[time=3176] being possessed with faith, that I am speaking about it this service and will give a part
[time=3184] two of it tonight.
[time=3187] Because I repeat what I said at the beginning, "No one has ever lived a Christian life in the 20th century in any kind of successful manner unless they had their hearts pregnant
[time=3201] with faith." Now we have seen in the text that a Christian must believe that God is, that is the Christian,
[time=3214] and secondly we must believe that he is a rewarder.
[time=3219] Now it's based upon the condition, and we want to speak about it at the outset, he is
[time=3226] a rewarder of them that meets the condition.
[time=3231] Those that diligently seek him.
[time=3236] It's interesting that we have our lives so structured that we sort of hit and run when
[time=3247] it comes to our relationship with God.
[time=3252] We do things in such a hurry when it comes to this matter of practicing fellowship with
[time=3261] a holy God.
[time=3266] Here in the Bible it says he is the kind of a God that loves to give good gifts to his
[time=3273] children.
[time=3274] He likes to reward us.
[time=3279] You're going to find that once you become a believer in Jesus Christ and you're saved by his grace, something takes place, and that being that you begin to walk down that road
[time=3290] a little bit.
[time=3291] You find out that everything in the Christian life operates on the principle of faith.
[time=3297] You can't see out there in the future.
[time=3300] The eye of faith is the only thing that helps you out.
[time=3304] The second thing you're going to find out is that after you walk down that road a little bit, testing is going to come.
[time=3312] And as that testing comes, it comes for one reason, and that is to strengthen your faith.
[time=3318] When you walk a little bit further, and the blessing of God comes upon you, that's the way he rewards you.
[time=3325] And I know how you feel, you feel just like all of us.
[time=3329] God, I am so unworthy for you to bless me in this way.
[time=3335] Because you see, we're all sinners.
[time=3338] And for those of us who have been saved, we've been saved by grace through faith.
[time=3346] That was not even of ourselves.
[time=3349] So now we have an eternal relationship with God, but from time to time we continue to sin.
[time=3357] And God in his holy manner continues to bless us by forgiving us of our sins.
[time=3368] You know, I want to tell you this morning that none of us deserve what God has poured
[time=3376] down upon our lives.
[time=3378] I report to you again the Bible clearly teaches for those who diligently seek Him.
[time=3385] He is going to reward us.
[time=3389] We don't spend enough time talking about God rewarding his children.
[time=3393] Let me give you an illustration.
[time=3396] In 1979, my wife and I in Jack Wertzen were the first religious leaders allowed to go
[time=3402] into communist China without having to go through five days of communist orientation.
[time=3409] We also were the first ones to take boxes of Bibles and take them through their customs
[time=3417] and have that approved by customs.
[time=3420] It's a real story of the grace of God, miracle after miracle took place.
[time=3426] We used to have missionaries in prison in China, so when we got on that airplane finally with
[time=3432] our Bibles and our Gospels of John's and our Chinese tracks, we knew that God had gone
[time=3438] before us and prepared the way.
[time=3441] It was a wonderful thing what God had done.
[time=3444] And there were times and days when my wife, all by herself, would go two and a half hours
[time=3450] alone down a street.
[time=3452] And I'd go down another street and Jack Wertzen would go down another street.
[time=3457] And everyone we came in contact with, we shared with them in Mandarin and in Cantonese, a little
[time=3463] leaflet about the greatest person that has ever lived in all of human history, the Lord
[time=3469] Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[time=3473] You know, thousands of people we spoke to and we only found one person that had ever heard
[time=3479] the name, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3484] We came out of China with a great burden that we should do something.
[time=3488] And so we felt as though that we ought to expand our little Bible college and train Chinese
[time=3494] young people so that they could go in and spread the Gospel of Christ in the communist China.
[time=3500] But it was going to take a large amount of money.
[time=3503] We found out that for $650,000 we could buy additional space.
[time=3509] We had 10 weeks in order to believe God for that $650,000.
[time=3516] I must make this short, but I want to tell you that we had 180.
[time=3523] You've been sharing the Bible hour.
[time=3526] If as a result of this program, you have made a decision about your relationship to Jesus Christ.
[time=3532] We would like to send you some material which will help you.
[time=3535] Please write to us and indicate the nature of your decision.
