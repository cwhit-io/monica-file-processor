[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=48] in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=52] Thank you, my soul, my name, and the thee.
[time=59] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[time=66] And since my soul will save, I'll leave.
[time=74] I'll bring the hope, I'll pray.
[time=82] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=96] What a joy it is this beautiful morning to hear your voices lifted in praise, singing how great thou art.
[time=104] We've come this morning to our second worship service that we could praise God through the singing of our voices and through the study of His Word today.
[time=113] We welcome you this morning to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=116] If you're a visitor, thank you for joining us.
[time=118] It's good to see all of our regular people.
[time=121] We want to extend a special welcome to our friends who are joining us at this time for the Bible Hour.
[time=128] Today we're going to hear some special music that I know will encourage you and give you strength within your soul.
[time=135] And today we're going to hear from the choir as they sing for us, "No one understands.
[time=140] They're under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger." [MUSIC] the world understands why Jesus, He's afraid me I'm compared.
[time=162] We give that the throne of mercy, He is waiting for you there.
[time=174] No one understands why Jesus, when the days are dark and real, No one is so near, so
[time=190] dear as Jesus, can stir every care on me.
[time=206] No one understands why Jesus, every holy season feels.
[time=218] We tenderly whispers from court and the broken heart he hears.
[time=231] No one understands why Jesus, when you wander on the way.
[time=257] No one understands why Jesus, when the days are dark and real, No one is so near, so
[time=286] dear as Jesus, can stir every care on me.
[time=312] Was the apostle Peter who wrote in his first epistle, cast all of your care upon him, for
[time=323] he cares for you.
[time=326] God cares about you this morning, regardless of your station or your circumstance in life,
[time=332] he cares for you.
[time=335] Steve Maria Gardner have come to sing something of the care of God as they speak of the love of God singing, love reaching Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=346] His love went on longing and his love went on reaching.
[time=374] I passed the shackles of my mind, and the world of the Father became Mary's little son,
[time=397] and his love reached all the way to where I were.
[time=415] And now today God is still reaching down in love through his Son, even though we have
[time=421] been already judged, and according to scripture every one of us has been condemned because of our sin, nevertheless God reaches down, reconciling us to himself.
[time=433] Because of the sacrificial gift of Jesus Christ on Calvary, God can cleanse and adopt
[time=439] you into his family even today, to as many as receive him, to them he gives the power to
[time=445] become the sons and daughters of God.
[time=450] Still is longing and his love still is reaching.
[time=464] I passed the shackles of my mind, because the word of the Father became Mary's little
[time=485] son, and his love reached all the way to where I were.
[time=502] And I passed the shackles of my mind, and his love reached all the way to where I
[time=517] was born.
[time=520] And I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and I passed the shackles of my mind, and the longing and reaching became Mary's little son, and his love still reaches
[time=550] next to where we are.
[time=573] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=575] Each Sunday morning Don and I look forward to this time in the middle of the broadcast just to talk with you who are friends in the television audience.
[time=584] It's an enjoyable time for us.
[time=586] We always appreciate when people write us and tell us that they're listening and encouraging us, and we really, really appreciate you being there this morning.
[time=594] Yes, thank you for your many letters of encouragement sharing with us that God's word is encouraging
[time=600] your life and in strengthening you spiritually, and we love to hear from you, and if you'd like to write to us, write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code
[time=614] is 46815, and if you would like when you write to us, request the little booklet that
[time=621] we've been offering for several weeks now entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=626] It's been written by our own friend, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=630] It's an excellent little booklet on how to cope with some of the frustrating things that come up in life.
[time=636] Don has a copy of that with him, and he'd like to share a little bit about that with you.
[time=640] Pastor Rick, the people who have been writing us have been telling us how very practical this book is and how they can understand it, and we appreciate the fact that we can send this out to you.
[time=649] It is practical, and it is understandable.
[time=651] There's a section in here called Conflict in the Mind.
[time=654] It says for Christians, the will and the imagination are often in conflict, and then Dr.
[time=659] Ken goes on to tell us how that we can get those into sync together.
[time=664] A personal daily fellowship with God is missing, and when that is the case, then a carnal imagination will take over.
[time=671] It's a very, very practical book.
[time=673] In the back, there are some additional verses of Scripture that you might turn to for extra help and extra aid in trying to overcome negative thinking.
[time=681] The book is entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking, and we'd love to send it to you.
[time=686] That's right to us, the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=703] We do hope that we hear from you this week and that you request this little booklet.
[time=708] Many of you have not only written in requesting information, but you've sent financial support
[time=714] to this ministry.
[time=715] You are deeply appreciative of that.
[time=719] The Bible Hour is made available by the sponsorship of the Founders Club and special people just like you who send in finances.
[time=727] Perhaps last week you remember my friend Dick Godfrey shared a word of testimony, how he visited in the home of a lady on a regular business call trying to sell vacuum cleaners,
[time=738] and they discovered that each other had a mutual interest here in the Black Hawk Baptist Church and in the Bible Hour.
[time=745] And as they talked, she discovered that there was a financial need and said she was going to think about doing something.
[time=751] Dick just encouraged her to not think about it, but to do it.
[time=755] I imagine there are many of you in that exact same mode of thinking that today you've been thinking about it.
[time=761] Wouldn't you please help this ministry?
[time=763] The Bible Hour is made possible by people just like yourself who give.
[time=767] We'd love to hear from you today.
[time=769] We'd love to send you this special booklet.
[time=772] We have a special guest coming next week.
[time=774] His name is Dr. Paul Dixon.
[time=776] I believe he's been a friend of yours for many years.
[time=778] Hasn't he done?
[time=779] Yes, we've been in evangelistic campaigns together many times.
[time=782] He spoke at a manual Baptist Church in Toledo, and I was the song leader there, and I appreciate his ministry very much.
[time=788] He has been here several times to speak.
[time=790] Most recently, a year ago this past summer for the summer Bible Conference.
[time=795] I remember him speaking very vividly out of the book of John.
[time=799] We're looking forward to his coming.
[time=801] He has been most of his time in the ministry and evangelist, going to many, many different
[time=807] churches, and he has an extraordinary gift of communication deep inside into the Word of God, and that special ability to make it practical to you and I.
[time=818] Right now he is the president of Cedarville College, one of the premier schools of Christian education in our country.
[time=825] We're looking forward to his coming, and I trust that you'll be joining us next week.
[time=830] Thank you again for watching the Bible Hour and for writing your notes of encouragement and for your financial support.
[time=837] God bless you and have a great day.
[time=860] [MUSIC]
[time=884] Living below in this old simple world, I be a comfort and a pawn, driving along to face
[time=909] the world. I am a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a
[time=1065] comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort and a comfort.
[time=1090] [MUSIC] >> Well, that is some lengthy service to the Lord. We appreciate the fact
[time=1100] that we are the beneficiaries of that. Tell us, how did you two meet together? Did you just computer match up that you had good voices and they blended and so you came together?
[time=1111] >> We actually met while traveling with a group called the Spurlows before that. Steve and I were involved in Youth for Christ. We were at the same places all the time but never met. So it took the group to get us together. >> I let her answer that because my version
[time=1124] is a little different. >> I remember last time I heard you say that, you said that Maria saw me from a far off and she shook her head. No, no, it wasn't quite. >> Oh, yes, yes.
[time=1137] >> She doesn't have a mic right now either. So she doesn't have any choice. >> I control that. >> She probably won't get it back. Well, you know, a lot of people think that you just come here to sing. But this is really your church home, isn't it? How did you locate here? >> Steve and I have sung here probably seven or eight times before we actually moved
[time=1156] here and we found that the people here at Blackhawk were always so loving and receptive of us in our ministry that when we decided to move back to the Midwest, this was just a very logical place to come. No problem at all deciding. >> We're so thankful that you picked this place to call your church home and that you share in the ministry here. You know, I know many people probably have the misimpression that every time you sing that we pay you an honorarium. But that's not true, is it? >> No, that's not a bad idea.
[time=1184] >> You'll vote for that one. >> No, that's true. We travel, we are full-time
[time=1190] traveling and singing on the road. But this is a situation because it's our home church
[time=1196] where we give gladly of our time and we feel that we receive a great deal back by just being involved here. >> I'm glad you feel that way because we certainly do feel like we're going to receive a great deal out of the fact that you sacrifice and give of your time and your talent and your treasure to the Lord and share with us. God bless you and we sure appreciate your friendship. >> Thank you. >> Thank you, Stephen Maria.
[time=1218] Just before the morning message, Don Kruger is going to come and sing a song for us about the Lord Jesus Christ and his death for us.
[time=1239] >> Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=1333] Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe, sin had left a crimson stain, he washed it white
[time=1355] no, Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe, I will do as he combines, I'll stay, I'll
[time=1381] give I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe, I owe.
[time=1405] >> Thank you, Don, for that reminder that Jesus Christ loves us and that he gave us all
[time=1414] for us and now all to him I owe, I don't know if you experience some of the same things
[time=1421] that I experience in my own life and in our home but there are certain little words or phrases that always get a reaction, we have a two year old and here's a guaranteed way
[time=1432] to get a reaction, Rachel, it's time to go to bed, suddenly, you know, no go to bed,
[time=1439] play games, you know, and there's this, mention that word bed and there's a reaction, there's another phrase around our house that gets a reaction as I open up the checkbook and I see a whole list of checks written but the balance isn't done, I say honey, did you
[time=1454] balance the checkbook, that gets a reaction, there are little things in our life that get a reaction, here's a word that gets a reaction from most of us, taxes, does that ever give you a reaction when you think of taxes?
[time=1467] One lady gave me a little article this week from our church, it was on taxes, it was a story about a man who had moved into this country and he asked a Native American what
[time=1478] the flag meant to him, the Native American said well our flag is related to our taxes,
[time=1484] red, white and blue and has stars, for you see whenever we think of our taxes we get red, when we open up the notice from Uncle Sam of how much we owe we turn white as a
[time=1495] ghost, we turn blue as we try to pay them and if we don't we see stars, well taxes often
[time=1502] get a reaction, don't they, but you know in the church there's a word that'll get a reaction
[time=1509] every time, it's the word money.
[time=1512] Whenever a church talks about money suddenly their motives become suspect, all that church
[time=1518] ever wants is money, all those TV preachers ever ask for is we need your money, send us
[time=1524] your check today, it gets a reaction, many times there are those that question the motives
[time=1530] of a ministry, there are those that question the financial integrity of how money spent
[time=1536] money gets a reaction, it's a difficult thing to talk about when we speak of the area of
[time=1543] treasury and the stewardship of what we possess financially, yet in the word of God it gives
[time=1550] us instruction of all the passages of the Bible I believe that 2 Corinthians the chapter
[time=1556] teaches us the most about the area of financial stewardship because it teaches out of example,
[time=1563] if you want to learn something learn by example, so I invite you to turn with me if you will
[time=1569] to 2 Corinthians the 8th chapter, the Apostle Paul wrote a letter to the church of Corinth
[time=1577] and in that letter he cites an example, I'm going to read for you and I invite you to
[time=1583] follow along in your Bibles as I read 2 Corinthians the 8th chapter verses 1 through 9, moreover
[time=1593] brethren we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia,
[time=1602] how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty
[time=1610] abounded unto the riches of their liberality, for to their power I bear witness, yay and
[time=1620] be on their power they were willing of themselves, begging us with much entreaty that we should
[time=1629] receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints, and this
[time=1638] they did not as we had hoped but first gave themselves to the Lord and unto us by the
[time=1648] will of God, in so much that we besought Titus that as he had begun so he would also
[time=1657] finish in you the same grace also, therefore as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance
[time=1668] and knowledge and diligence and in your love to us see that you abound in this grace also,
[time=1678] I speak not by commandment but by occasion of the earnestness of others and to prove the
[time=1685] sincerity of your love, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was
[time=1693] rich yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich,
[time=1702] actually this is teaching by example, it's what you might call this morning a stewardship testimony, Paul writes to the church of Corinth about the example the testimony of the churches
[time=1715] of Macedonia, now what were those churches, primarily when we think of the churches of Macedonia we should think of three particular churches that we encounter in the book of Acts,
[time=1726] the first the church of Philippi, Paul wrote to that church and Epistle entitled the Book of
[time=1733] Philippians, we've been studying that in recent weeks, a second church in Macedonia was the
[time=1739] church of Thessalonica, we have two letters to that church, first and second Thessalonians,
[time=1745] the final church, one of the churches that receives a great commendation in the Bible, that third church is the church of Berea, the Apostle Paul went to that church, they received
[time=1757] the word of God and Luke said they were more noble than the Thessal and icons, for they searched the scriptures diligently to see if these things were true, those three churches are
[time=1767] located in the far northern part of Greece called Macedonia, if you can picture Greece as a long
[time=1774] peninsula that comes down from Europe into the Mediterranean Sea at the north eastern side on
[time=1781] the Aegean Sea is Macedonia and those three coastal cities Thessalonica, Philippi and Brea,
[time=1787] then that country of Greece narrows to a very small isthmus and then it bronze again into the
[time=1794] Peloponnesus the five pronged southern extremity of Greece where that narrow isthmus is Corinth,
[time=1801] Paul writes to these people of Corinth giving to them a testimony, a way of example of these churches of Macedonia and he speaks of their giving, I selected this passage this morning
[time=1814] because it speaks so clearly and so directly, there are times that as you study the scriptures you seek for an outline that would rise out of the text they'll give organization but yet within this text it is obvious what the apostle is speaking of and his outline is apparent. First
[time=1831] of all he says that their giving was out of grace, listen to the phrase in verse one, moreover brethren that is we want to make known to you the grace of God, it was giving out of
[time=1846] grace and the first thing that we need to discover in this passage is that in the New Testament we
[time=1852] give out of grace and not out of law, listen to these verses, verse one, the grace of God, verse
[time=1860] six, the last phrase, the same grace also, verse seven, therefore as you abound in everything and
[time=1868] he lists faith, utterance, knowledge, diligence, love, here's the key phrase that you abound in
[time=1875] this grace also, verse nine, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, verse 19, it says,
[time=1885] and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace.
[time=1893] In the Old Testament there was a law, a law, a moral obligation that an individual had to give
[time=1902] and the law stipulated what that amount was to be. There are those who confuse biblical truth and
[time=1909] take the law out of the Old Testament and bring it to the New Testament, they do not understand the
[time=1916] teaching of the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament for the Apostle Paul wrote
[time=1922] in Romans the sixth chapter, we are not under law but under grace, but not only do most people
[time=1928] confuse that which is an Old Testament doctrine and apply it to the church, equating the church in
[time=1934] Israel as one and the same when they are not in the scriptures, they really don't understand the Old Testament either because every time I hear someone speak of the law and that the church is
[time=1945] the tithe, they speak of 10%. The Old Testament does not speak of a 10% tithe, yes there was one
[time=1953] tithe that was 10% that went to support the Levites in the priest, however there was a second tithe
[time=1960] of an additional 20%, total, two 10%, totaling 20%. However every third year there was a third
[time=1971] tithe of 10%, averaged out that's 23 and one third, however every seventh year there was an
[time=1979] additional tithe that was given, then every 50th year was a year of Jubilee, seven times seven is
[time=1987] 49 and after they went through seven cycles of seven, the 50th year in the Old Testament, all debts
[time=1993] were relinquished, the people gave far far more than 10%, far more than 23 and a third percent,
[time=2001] so when we speak of giving in the New Testament we are speaking of grace giving, not giving out
[time=2008] of the law, if we did we would not focus in on the figure of 10%, notice if you're not convinced by
[time=2016] the word grace read this same chapter verse eight, the apostle Paul says, I speak not by
[time=2023] commandment but by occasion, what are you saying is I'm not writing you to command you to give,
[time=2029] I'm simply writing because there is a need and an opportunity, this occasion has sponsored the
[time=2035] appeal, so today when we give to the Lord Jesus Christ we do not give out of obligation to a law
[time=2041] to a mathematical figure, now can I be honest with you this morning as a pastor and someone
[time=2047] responsible for the finances of a church along with a board of deacons and the staff, we're responsible for the finances of this church, $1.3 million, we're responsible for the finances of
[time=2060] the Bible hour ministry and there comes a carnal desire in my mind not to teach the fact that
[time=2067] the New Testament says that we give by grace, you say what is that carnal desire, it's the
[time=2073] desire to avoid the point because there are many many people today who give 10% and if they knew
[time=2079] God didn't demand that as a law they'd stop giving that 10% and my carnal mind says well then don't say you know you got to keep the 10% coming, now today we don't give because of law and we
[time=2091] do not give by manipulation, it's not the job of the pulpit to manipulate people so as to build a
[time=2098] sense of obligation or debt that we give because we have to give it's the law, now the Bible says
[time=2104] we give out of grace, God was not obligated to give His Son, He gave out of grace, therefore it
[time=2111] says in verse 9 for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that for your sakes He gave up the riches of heaven and accepted the poverty of earth, we give to God the same way we give today
[time=2124] out of grace, the apostle Paul says I do not speak by commandment, I speak because there's
[time=2132] opportunity to give, these people gave voluntarily, that's brought out again in verse 4 listen to
[time=2138] this, beseeching us with much in treaty that we would receive the gift, now could you imagine the
[time=2145] situation, here's the apostle Paul and these people have money they want to give and they've got to beg Paul to give the money, it's usually the collector begging the people to give, now could you imagine next Sunday morning if we announce that men and women we've got everybody we can as
[time=2161] an usher, we've gotten all the people to know how to count the money, there's too much money coming we don't have enough ushers to pick it up and enough counters to count it, please stop giving,
[time=2172] I said that in the first service and someone started singing oh that will be glory for me, but you know that's exactly what happened here, Paul said you can't give and they said oh please
[time=2183] let us give, you know it's usually the collectors doing the begging, we need your money, send us
[time=2191] your money, I remember listening to a radio broadcast about 10 years ago, I don't know who it was, it's probably best and it was an eloquent message, deep resident voice very unlike mine and very
[time=2203] majestic, he pronounced all the words just right, see I even said just right wrong, it's just right,
[time=2210] he pronounced just right and he just said everything perfect and then at the end of that message he
[time=2216] said now if the Lord has been blessing you through this ministry and if the Lord has been building up
[time=2222] your spiritual life through this same deep majestic voice and then suddenly his attitude and his
[time=2228] voice snapped and he said and you haven't been giving then you're nothing but chintzy, you're cheap and he won after those people and I thought good grief, what is this guy after, my heart
[time=2238] for Christ or my money, you know there is a danger of manipulation, there's a danger of contriving,
[time=2247] there's a danger that we give people impression that they have to give 10%, 23 and a third percent,
[time=2253] every 50 years they got just like these youths, no men and women this is not the nation of Israel, this is the church of Jesus Christ, it was brought about by the grace of God and today we give
[time=2264] out of the grace of God, not by coercion, not by manipulation, not out of guilt we give this morning
[time=2272] out of love, well secondly Paul not only teaches that we give out of grace, not out of the law,
[time=2278] he teaches that we give out of sacrifice not out of abundance, look with me at verse two,
[time=2285] speaking of the churches of Macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of
[time=2292] their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality, you know what he
[time=2298] was saying, he was saying that these people were not the affluent people, these people were not
[time=2304] the wealthy people who could give out of their abundance, you know many people give out of their
[time=2310] abundance, there's nothing wrong with that but these people's giving was sacrificial, there are
[time=2316] those that begin during the last days of December to figure out their income tax and if they sense
[time=2322] they're going to have to pay too much tax then they simply give more money away so to bring their income tax bracket down they don't pay as much taxes, they're giving out of abundance, that's not
[time=2333] wrong but yet the bible teaches that as we give many times it becomes sacrificial, we give not out
[time=2341] of our surplus but even out of our need, listen to how he described these people out of their great
[time=2348] trial of affliction, do you know what their trial was and their affliction, one of the things was
[time=2355] taxes and inflation, Macedonia was an area of Roman domination, Philippi was a Roman colony,
[time=2364] Thessalonica and Maria were Roman captives, the Romans would extract excessive taxes
[time=2372] out of these people and the taxes had to diminish the income of the people and had left the economic
[time=2379] area depressed, they needed Reaganomics, however they didn't have that and the taxes just kept
[time=2386] increasing and increasing to the land actually became impoverished, out of that situation these
[time=2393] people gave but personally it says they gave out of their deep poverty, that little word poverty
[time=2400] comes to mean a beggar, someone that actually lives hand to mouth, these were not the affluent
[time=2406] people that were giving, these were the poor that give, do you know the same things true in our country, internal revenue service relinquished some figures that on an average people last year
[time=2418] 1980 who made between $4,000 and $6,000 gave on an average of $425, it's about 10 percent,
[time=2430] now you need to understand that those people are below the poverty level, those people not only don't pay taxes, when you and I pay taxes we get money back called earned income credit, these people in this low economic condition gave $425 as an average about 10 percent, in the same
[time=2451] article it went on to say that people between $30,000 and $50,000 income, the upper class,
[time=2459] the financially affluent, those people gave as an average of $869, about 2 percent,
[time=2468] you see people do not really give sacrificially, the poor do, the wealthy only give out of their
[time=2479] abundance, that's why Jesus Christ said of the widow that she gave the most, flip back if you will
[time=2486] to this passage, mark the 12th chapter, mark 1241 you'll encounter some interesting
[time=2492] statements by the Lord Jesus Christ, says this in verse 41 and Jesus sat opposite the treasury
[time=2501] and behold the people cast their money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much,
[time=2508] that was the $30,000 to $50,000 bracket and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two
[time=2515] mites which make a following, now a mite was the smallest coin in the Roman Empire, you might call
[time=2521] it a penny, a cent, she came by, took two cents out of her pocket and said here I'll give you two cents, but listen to Jesus' commentary on what she said and he called unto his disciples and
[time=2534] saith unto them, verily I send you this poor widow has cast in more than all those who cast in the
[time=2542] treasury, you say wait a minute, she just gave two pennies and in the verse above that it said the rich came and they cast in much, explanation verse 44, for all they did cast in of their abundance
[time=2557] but she of her want did cast in all that she had even her living, you see what the Bible was saying
[time=2565] here, it is saying that the people of Macedonia gave sacrificially and their small sacrificial gift
[time=2572] before the Lord was a greater value than those that gave out of their abundance, is the Bible condemning giving out of abundance, no it's not, it's not condemning at all, it's simply
[time=2583] exalting those who give at a point of sacrifice, you know I have to weigh my own heart, I don't know
[time=2590] that I really sacrifice very much, if I was to list out the things that I sacrificed it would
[time=2597] really begin to form a list of luxuries, people do give out of sacrifice, the challenge God's
[time=2604] got to my own heart is that I would live sacrificially, sacrificially, well not only did they give out
[time=2611] of grace, did they give sacrificially, they gave joyfully, listen to verse two, how then in a great
[time=2619] trial of affliction the abundance of their joy, these people gave with a joy for heart,
[time=2625] look down to the next chapter, 2 Corinthians 9 verse 11, every man according as he is purposed
[time=2634] in his heart so let him give, not grudgingly or a necessity for God loves a cheerful giver,
[time=2643] you know what the Bible saying is we give him to the Lord, we ought to give cheerfully, it says first of all we ought to purpose in our heart and as we purpose in our heart our purpose ought to be out of joy, if this morning you give and you are a little bit bitter at the church because they are
[time=2659] asking for money and you give and you're grudging in your heart and you really don't want to give,
[time=2666] Bible says you're giving out the wrong attitude, you probably ought not to give, I was talking this over with Ken Nick was he's oh no don't tell him if they're not giving joyfully don't tell him not to give just send him across the street to the counseling center and we'll teach him how to be joyful as they give for forty dollars an hour and then we'll tie four dollars that ten dollars
[time=2684] this morning you give joyfully you know if you really come today and you find that in your heart
[time=2691] you're upset the offering bugs you that just really bugs you and whenever the church talks about money
[time=2700] you just begin to want to know about their motives and how much old so-and-so gets paid and how much
[time=2706] they spent on something that just look like frills if it really bugs you this morning if you get upset
[time=2714] to give the Bible says maybe ought not to give says to purpose in your heart so you give joyfully
[time=2720] this morning see men when we don't come here to give a 10 tie we don't come here to give out of
[time=2726] obligation it's not my role to manipulate you to whip you into an emotional frenzy
[time=2732] to coerce you to give and then tomorrow when you sat down saying I can't believe I gave all that
[time=2738] money and your heart's better oh no the Bible says that these people gave because they love God
[time=2744] and they gave a grace gift they gave sacrificially but most importantly they gave out of a heart
[time=2751] that was full of joy then it says they gave generously the last word listen to verse two again
[time=2758] the abundance of their joy added to their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their
[time=2766] liberality they gave liberally they gave generously you know one of the favorite quotes that I've learned
[time=2775] comes out of the life of Jim Elliot that missionary to the aca indians who not only gave of his time
[time=2782] but he gave his life to those people he said this he is no fool who gives that which he cannot keep
[time=2791] to gain that which he can never lose you know this morning we give if we give generously it's because
[time=2800] we know we're giving that which we cannot keep to gain that which we could never never lose
[time=2806] as you give this morning tonight today in the morning tonight as we take offerings
[time=2812] we give out of a generous heart because we know we're giving to the work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=2819] and that will never never fade away we're generous in our giving did you know that as you meet today
[time=2825] you're in one of the most generous giving churches that we know of our people are giving people we
[time=2832] thank God for their gifts not only that do they give their money they give of their time we had a
[time=2838] school play here last night Leon Pippen was the director of that play all morning he's been ecstatic
[time=2844] he could not believe the numbers of people that gave of their time even at midnight to restore a
[time=2851] building from a play to a church auditorium this is a giving body of people you are surrounded by
[time=2857] generous people these people of Macedonia gave generously they gave joyfully they gave
[time=2866] sacrificially and they gave out of grace verse three for to their power I bear witness Jay and
[time=2873] beyond their power they were willing to give of themselves what the apostle Paul was saying they were giving according to their ability they were giving according to their ability but they were
[time=2883] giving even be on that you know there is a New Testament formula for giving giving let me invite
[time=2890] you to turn to that first Corinthians chapter 16 verses one and two give us a simple little formula
[time=2898] for New Testament giving first Corinthians 16 one and two now concerning the collection
[time=2906] for the saints as I have given order to the churches of Galatia even do you here's the formula upon
[time=2914] the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him and store as God has prospered him
[time=2920] that there be no gatherings when I come here's the formula first of all we give regularly it says
[time=2927] on the first day of the week first formula we give regularly second part of the formula
[time=2935] let each one of you secondly it's a responsibility of all of us you know those that say oh yes but
[time=2943] giving is a spiritual gift isn't it yes it is well I don't have the spiritual gift of giving
[time=2949] therefore I'm not supposed to give oh no I don't know that I have the gift of evangelism
[time=2956] but I'm I exempt from sharing the gospel no I'm not Jesus said for all of us to go into the world
[time=2963] I may not have the gift of teaching does that mean that within my own home I don't teach my children of Jesus and his love for them oh no I must teach I must evangelize and even if I don't
[time=2974] possess the gift of giving it says it is a responsibility of each of us let each one of you
[time=2980] and then finally we give regularly responsibly thirdly out of our resources as God has prospered
[time=2989] him God says that we give as he is given to us we give back a portion to God that according
[time=2997] to how he is prospered us can you remember that three point outline we give regularly we give out
[time=3004] of responsibility that each of us bear and then finally we give according to how God has prospered
[time=3010] us you know these people Macedonia met that formula Paul said they gave according to their
[time=3016] power their ability they matched the formula but then it says but they did more they did more they
[time=3022] went beyond their ability a super giving people who gave beyond what they normally could and the
[time=3031] Bible even takes it further it says they gave of themselves look at verse five and this they did
[time=3038] not as we had hoped but they first gave themselves to the Lord and unto us by the will of God
[time=3046] you know giving comes from one of two sources today you can give out of your billfold or you can give
[time=3053] out of your heart you know stewardship and lordship are not divorced they are one in the same
[time=3062] that is we give our life to God he begins to possess every area of that life and so we sing Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart but if Jesus is not Lord then you struggle because
[time=3076] your heart doesn't want to give and there's compelling so you give out of your billfold not your heart but you see the priority of dedication to Christ first that we give ourselves to him
[time=3087] this Christ possessed you today I remember a song by Keith Green that a phrase of it sticks in my
[time=3094] mind he said this quoting some verses of scripture put together to obey is better than sacrifice
[time=3103] I don't need your money I want your life to obey is better than sacrifice I don't need your money
[time=3114] I want your life you know this may sound strange even counterdictory to things you hear God does not
[time=3122] need your money I was at the mall bought a new tie yesterday the man shared with me that he watches
[time=3130] the Bible hour he said you know I don't worry about finances he said the guy I work for he owns cattle on a thousand hills and if I get hungry he's just going to slaughter me one of them fatted calves lord owns cattle he doesn't need our money he wants our lives and then when he possesses us
[time=3148] and when he owns us in stewardship really doesn't become a consequence of our life
[time=3154] to obey is better than sacrifice I don't need your money I want your life have you given your heart
[time=3160] to Jesus Christ today is he the lord of your life these people knew him as lord let's review how
[time=3168] they gave they gave out of grace they gave sacrificially they gave with a joyful heart
[time=3176] they gave generously they gave beyond their ability they gave of themselves to the lord
[time=3183] you know finally I believe they gave imitating Jesus Christ verse nine for you know the grace of
[time=3191] our lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that through his
[time=3198] poverty you might be made rich you see Jesus was the original giver and when we come to know Christ
[time=3206] then we begin to meet the author of giving himself story is told by Charles swindell in his book
[time=3214] improving your serve of a little boy world war two had just ended london had been bombed by the
[time=3222] Germans u.s. soldier had stayed to help rebuild the city for many orphans in many windows little
[time=3230] orphan boy leaned his forehead against the glass of a bakery and through the glass he could see his
[time=3236] donuts were being taken out of the bakery the little orphan boy was hungry but he had no money
[time=3243] the soldier driving by saw that and he pulled over and he kind of stood behind a little boy for a moment observed what was taking place and he said little boy did you like some donuts little boy
[time=3255] wanted some so the soldier went in and he bought the donuts came out and gave them to the little boy started to walk away there was a tug on his coat little boy reached out and pulled on the
[time=3266] soldier's coat soldier said yes little boy said mr are you god mr are you god
[time=3275] you see we are never more like god than when we are giving whether it be our time our talent
[time=3285] our treasure mr are you god bible says that for god so loved the world that he gave his only
[time=3296] begotten son first nine for you know the grace the giving of our lord jesus christ
[time=3306] that though he was rich he possessed all the glory and wealth that was a heaven
[time=3312] he became poor you know when jesus left heaven he came to the earth he didn't come to a castle
[time=3318] he didn't come to a palace he didn't come to a nice home in the suburbs jesus came and said these words the foxes have holes and the birds have nests but the son of
[time=3329] man hath not wear to lay his head though he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor that we
[time=3339] through his poverty through his suffering through his death we might be made rich what are those
[time=3345] riches Ephesians tells us now we are made to sit in the heavenlies with christ jesus we possess
[time=3351] the riches that belong to god jesus said lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths
[time=3360] come and eat where rust comes and corrode where thieves break through and steal he said lay up
[time=3368] for yourselves treasure in heaven for their secure jim melly it said he is no fool who gives up
[time=3375] that which he cannot keep to gain that which he can never lose jesus christ gave up all of heaven
[time=3383] to suffer and to die for my sins and for yours and though he was rich he became poor that we might
[time=3391] be rich in christ today do you know him a savior are you like these people in verse five that did
[time=3400] more they not did only what paul hoped but they first gave of themselves have you given your heart
[time=3408] to jesus christ this morning you know you may have been busy this last 35 minutes during this message
[time=3415] building a barrier between you and god you might have been building the barrier that said that church talks about money too much i don't like churches that talk about money and so you've
[time=3425] been building barriers and now that becomes a barrier so you don't have to accept christ as your savior because they talk about money you may have built a different barrier you say oh i know a christian yeah i work with one of those i know how they talk but i also know how they live
[time=3440] he's a hypocrite and so you place this man between you and christ you build a barrier
[time=3446] during these last moments have you been building a barrier or would you by faith receive christ
[time=3452] is your savior i pray that you will let's bow together this morning as we've studied god's word
