[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (bell ringing) - From the Convocation Center
[time=58] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we present the Bible Hour.
[time=64] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=94] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=97] - Good morning, and welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=104] for our second worship service this morning.
[time=107] It's been a tremendous morning as we've heard Dr. Paul Dixon speak on the great passage of the Bible, "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." And at this time, we want to say a special hello and welcome to our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=125] We begin our service this morning with a great hymn of praise from our choir under the direction of Don Kruger.
[time=132] They sing because he lives.
[time=135] (gentle music)
[time=147] (singing in foreign language) [MUSIC - 229 seconds]
[time=399] It is because Jesus Christ lives that we have gathered here today.
[time=404] We have arisen Savior.
[time=406] He died for our sins, but he's alive today.
[time=410] And because Christ lives, we worship him this morning.
[time=414] We have a special guest with us today.
[time=416] Her name is Marsha Ives.
[time=418] She is the sister of Barb Padilla in our church.
[time=421] She is a gift in music and she comes to share for us a song that is entitled, "It is My Desire".
[time=430] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 331 seconds]
[time=770] Well Rick the purpose of the ministry is to have a more direct ministry to our viewers.
[time=776] We do that right now through mailings and letters, but we wanted to have an opportunity to help people who are dealing with specific problems such as loss of a loved one,
[time=786] spiritual problems, things of that nature.
[time=788] Well that sounds exciting.
[time=790] I know many of you who I've talked to have shared that right in the middle of the service, you're wrestling with a spiritual need.
[time=798] We just love to have someone to talk to.
[time=800] This makes it a reality for you.
[time=802] Exactly how it will work Ed.
[time=804] Well it's really simple Rick.
[time=806] During the hours of the telecast there'll be a number available for our viewers to call
[time=812] and there'll be lay counselor or lay Christians manning the phones to encourage them,
[time=818] counsel with them, pray with them, whatever their need may be.
[time=822] Will that be just during the hours of the Sunday service Ed?
[time=826] It's only on Sundays and the hours are between 9 a.m. on Sunday and 1 p.m.
[time=834] and then 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Sunday evenings.
[time=838] I see.
[time=838] Well that's great.
[time=840] What that means then is during the Sunday morning services when you're watching it, they'll come a number up on the screen, a telephone number and you simply call that number and you'll be able to be in touch with a trained counselor who would love to share with you
[time=854] and pray with you according to God's Word how you can deal with the problem you're wrestling with.
[time=860] Most of these people have been trained by you and Dr. Ken Nichols haven't they?
[time=864] That's right.
[time=866] Well great.
[time=866] We're so thankful for this new ministry that you'll be able to participate in.
[time=870] We trust that as you receive mailings from us that tell you a little bit about this
[time=876] that you'll begin praying that this ministry will become a reality.
[time=880] When are we targeted to begin this Ed?
[time=882] It would be the first Sunday in January, the beginning of the year.
[time=886] I might add that even though there's limited time now we hope to expand the time that we
[time=894] will have the telephone line available.
[time=898] Well that would be exciting.
[time=900] So it begins January the 1.
[time=902] Hopefully and prayerfully we're trusting that God will supply the financial needs of the
[time=908] Bible hour and I hope that you'll be praying about being a part of that financial need.
[time=914] If we're able to raise the $20,000 we need during this month of November then we have the green light to go ahead and begin this new and very, very personal ministry on the
[time=924] 1st of January.
[time=926] Wouldn't it be great if we could expand it beyond just the Sunday hours so that any time people needed help that they could call in but we're looking forward to beginning that
[time=936] and we're looking forward to you helping us financially to do that.
[time=940] I'd love to hear from you, won't you write us today?
[time=944] Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=950] The zip code is 46815 and while you're writing you may want to request a very helpful booklet
[time=958] entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=962] Don Kruger has one of those booklets in hand and a word to share about that.
[time=966] This is a tremendous little book that we've been offering and I might say Dr. Ken is a new writer for our Bible hour but people have been responding tremendously to him and we've
[time=976] gotten as much response if not more than other offers that we've had on TV and we really appreciate
[time=982] that and I know that you folk have been enjoying this little book.
[time=986] Isn't it true that you use this in counseling Dr. Ed?
[time=988] That's right.
[time=990] We find it to be a very helpful tool.
[time=992] And people have been saying that too as they've written into us and one thing I appreciate
[time=998] about the book is I enjoy hearing what other people have to say.
[time=1002] What does Pastor Rick think or what does Bible, another Bible commentator think?
[time=1006] But this little book is filled with what God thinks and what God says.
[time=1010] For instance under the topic the Bible is our first step in overcoming negative thinking.
[time=1018] The statement from God's word is and be not conformed to the world but be transformed by
[time=1024] the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[time=1030] It's so important for us to know not only what people say but what God says about a particular
[time=1036] subject and this is what God has to say.
[time=1040] If you would like this book we'd like you to write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 that's 15000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and we'll get this book to you.
[time=1052] Remedies for negative thinking.
[time=1054] Thank you Don.
[time=1056] In just a few moments we'll be returning to the church service and we're looking forward to today's message from Dr. Paul Dixon.
[time=1064] Dr. Dixon is the president of Cedarville College.
[time=1068] He himself went to college at Tennessee Temple in Tennessee and then he went to Temple Seminary
[time=1074] and graduated with a master's of divinity degree in 1964.
[time=1078] Then for 14 years he traveled all over the United States speaking about Jesus Christ as an evangelist.
[time=1088] God's given him some very special opportunities.
[time=1090] During the past year he has led chapels in the locker rooms of professional baseball teams
[time=1096] just before the games on Sundays.
[time=1100] He's been with the Cincinnati Reds and the Atlanta Braves, the LA Dodgers.
[time=1104] A whole host of teams invite him in to speak because he has such a great message about
[time=1110] how Jesus Christ can change people's lives.
[time=1112] I know you'll enjoy his message today and that his message will be of strength to your life.
[time=1118] But just before we go back to the service let me again encourage you to write in.
[time=1124] We'd love to hear from you, won't you write today to the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana?
[time=1132] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1136] Now as we go back to the service a group of ladies minister to us their name is strictly feminine
[time=1142] and their song will help prepare our heart to receive God's Word today.
[time=1154] [MUSIC]
[time=1172] An angel from love ago, then down to a pillow, and to Mary whispered love.
[time=1188] Call his name Jesus.
[time=1196] Fear not the words I say, God has spade Lord you today.
[time=1206] You shall bring forth the Son and call his name Jesus.
[time=1220] Cherish that beautiful name.
[time=1228] Cherish that wonderful name.
[time=1236] Cherish that natural's name.
[time=1244] That name is Jesus.
[time=1252] [MUSIC]
[time=1270] When all has come and gone, His name shall still live on, so magnify it loud and strong,
[time=1282] that wondrous name of Jesus, Jesus.
[time=1294] Cherish that beautiful name.
[time=1302] Cherish that wonderful name.
[time=1310] Cherish that magical's name.
[time=1318] That name is Jesus.
[time=1326] Cherish that beautiful name.
[time=1334] Cherish that wonderful name.
[time=1342] Cherish that fabulous name.
[time=1350] That name is Jesus.
[time=1360] [MUSIC]
[time=1388] Thank you ladies for reminding us of the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and our Savior.
[time=1394] Each week we like to share a testimony with you, just letting you meet people, a part of our church,
[time=1400] or friends that are visiting.
[time=1402] And I have my friend Jack Ventil standing one step below me, and he's still taller than I am.
[time=1408] How tall are you, Jack?
[time=1410] 6'8".
[time=1410] He is the second man who's been a giant that I've interviewed, and I've learned that we're not going to stand back.
[time=1416] We're just going to compensate by standing on extra steps.
[time=1420] In the first service this morning, I brought my little stool out with me and sat it down, stood up on top of that, but I was afraid I'd fall off of it and didn't want to do that.
[time=1428] Jack, how did you happen to come to our church, and how long have you been here?
[time=1432] Well, over three years ago we moved out to the northeast section of Fort Wayne,
[time=1438] and we were looking for a church that ministered to us as a family, that had programs for the entire family,
[time=1444] but also that was a Bible believing and evangelistic church.
[time=1448] And so we found Blackhawk and we came here.
[time=1452] Well, I'm glad that you came.
[time=1452] One of the first years Jack came, I was playing on a church basketball team, and the first thing we did was sign Jack up for basketball.
[time=1460] I'll tell you, it can be awful intimidating when you start going to the basket against a guy with 6'8,
[time=1466] and his arm reach makes it about 11 and a half feet.
[time=1470] It looks like it's above the basket from my view anyway.
[time=1472] Well, besides basketball, Jack, you've been a part of our choir, part of our evangelism ministry.
[time=1478] Your wife has been the secretary for all of our work in this emphasis of Jesus, be the Lord of all,
[time=1484] and you have a testimony to share too.
[time=1486] Well, it's often been heard that you cannot outgive God, and most of the time this is always presented in the financial aspect.
[time=1494] Now, I believe that firmly to be true, but the other areas of stewardship, which is time and talent,
[time=1502] I also believe that that is an area where you cannot outgive God, and I found that to be true in my own life.
[time=1508] And I know that many people here that is involved in the ministries of the church in other areas can go right along with me what I'm going to say.
[time=1516] I got back into evangelism this quarter again this fall, and the first thing you think of is it's going to take time.
[time=1524] It's another night out, it's time during the week that you have to spend studying your verses, remembering the outline.
[time=1530] But that time doesn't matter because when you get together and you go out visiting,
[time=1536] people that have visited us here at Blackhawk, we present the gospel, people accept Christ.
[time=1542] You see those people in their heart, you know they've accepted Christ, they get plugged into the ministries at Blackhawk here, become actively involved in loving Christ,
[time=1552] and then again, they get plugged into more ministries and spreading the gospel.
[time=1556] It's just a joy to see people react that way and being able to be a part of it.
[time=1562] And also in the choir, how again you think it's going to take time, which it does,
[time=1568] but the ministry back to us is choir members, how Don ministers to us with a word each week,
[time=1574] and also the songwriter.
[time=1576] You know, I feel kind of fortunate in the choir that we get to hear the song many times and we get to remember the words a lot better than the people here just get to hear the song once.
[time=1586] And so, you know, there's many areas that God blesses us as a family because of our involvement in the ministries of the time and talent besides the financial.
[time=1596] No, Jack, there's a verse in the Bible that says exactly that.
[time=1598] Jesus said, "Give, and it shall be given back unto you."
[time=1604] Good measure, pressed down, shaken together.
[time=1606] That means it's not like a pretzel box.
[time=1608] That when you open it for the first time, it's already half gone.
[time=1612] He says he shakes it down as we give, he gives back to us.
[time=1614] And I'm glad that you're a part of our ministry, giving of your time and your talent, and to know that God gives back to you is a way of encouraging all of us that we're to be serving Jesus Christ
[time=1626] in any way and in every way we possibly can.
[time=1628] Thank you, Jack, for your testimony and being with us today, and I'll see you on the ball court.
[time=1634] Well, we're encouraged each week as we meet people.
[time=1636] One of the joys of the ministry is seeing people just like you and I influencing others for Christ.
[time=1644] We often think it's the celebrity, the specialist that wins people to Christ, all of us can.
[time=1650] Whether we have a talent in evangelism, in choir, we can serve.
[time=1656] Stephen Maria come now with their talent to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and to minister to us
[time=1662] by singing about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1666] [MUSIC] Jesus is the sweetest name I know [MUSIC] And He's just the same as His lovely name [MUSIC] And that's the reason why I love Him so [MUSIC] The Lord Jesus is the sweetest name I know [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, He means all the world to me [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, without Him where would I be [MUSIC] He's like a cool drink of water on a hot summer's day [MUSIC] A light in the darkness that drives fear away [MUSIC] He's a pillow for a weary brow, a shelter for of the call [MUSIC] Jesus is all of these and more to my soul [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus [MUSIC] There's just something about that name [MUSIC] Sister, Savior, O Jesus [MUSIC] Like the fragrance after the rain [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, O Jesus [MUSIC] Let all Heaven and Earth proclaim [MUSIC] He can keep us, will all pass away [MUSIC] But there's something above the name ♪
[time=1916] Thank you, Stephen Maria, for preparing our hearts for the message this morning.
[time=1922] We have with us today Dr. Paul Dixon. Dr. Dixon is the president of Cedarville College.
[time=1928] He's been here to speak several times in the past.
[time=1932] For 14 years he was a traveling evangelist and he's literally gone to all parts of the United States.
[time=1938] And in recent years he's developed a rather special ministry in that he has invited often to speak in chapels before the games of professional baseball players.
[time=1950] This past year he's had the opportunity to be in chapel with the Philadelphia Phillies,
[time=1956] the Cincinnati Reds, which is probably his favorite team being close to home, the world champion Los Angeles Dodgers and several other teams.
[time=1964] He's a man of God with a ministry and he comes today to share with us a message
[time=1970] that God has laid upon his heart, Dr. Paul Dixon.
[time=1974] Thank you Pastor Hawks, it's a privilege to be back at Black Hawk.
[time=1982] We thank the Lord for what he's doing here in this church and I appreciate so much the faithful support that you give us at Cedarville College.
[time=1992] We get many young people from this church, from the school, from the community
[time=1998] and I appreciate the faithful financial support as well.
[time=2002] I want to share with you just a few things about what God is doing as you pray for us at the college.
[time=2008] We have 1,657 students enrolled this year.
[time=2014] That's a growth of 157 over last year.
[time=2018] We've grown 472 students in the last three years.
[time=2024] Now that's an amazing statistic when you realize that's almost a 40% growth in three years.
[time=2030] People are always asking, why?
[time=2034] Is there so much interest in what you're doing at Cedarville?
[time=2038] I think there are many answers to that question, but perhaps Tim LaHaye has summed it up well.
[time=2042] His daughter graduated from Cedarville and Tim said Cedarville has uniquely put together
[time=2048] an academic excellence with an emphasis upon evangelism
[time=2054] and discipleship, a spiritual warmth and fervor.
[time=2060] And that is our objective.
[time=2062] We have an exceptional academic program.
[time=2064] Business is our largest major, almost 400 business majors.
[time=2068] A very fine teacher education program with certification from the State of Ohio.
[time=2074] Tremendous science program with pre-med and 80% of our young people who've applied to med school have been accepted.
[time=2082] We just had approved on Friday by the Ohio State Board of Nursing
[time=2088] our brand new Bachelor of Science of Nursing program
[time=2094] that is now beginning with this fall quarter.
[time=2096] We started pre-engineering this year.
[time=2100] We have a social science major with pre-law and many of our young people going to some very prestigious law schools.
[time=2108] We also have psychology, music, phys ed, language, speech and broadcasting with our own radio station.
[time=2116] Obviously, many disciplines along with our Bible major where you can go and prepare for what God wants you to do.
[time=2124] But we blend that with Christian service, our young people being in 350 churches in the last 12 months, 100 young people on the mission fields in the last 12 months, we had them in mainland China, Australia, Brazil, the Philippines, Scotland, Germany, Israel, you can begin to see why people are interested in what we're doing.
[time=2146] We thank you for your prayers.
[time=2148] We'd encourage you to go out on the table and pick up one of our Cedarville College view books, especially you perspective college students
[time=2156] and the parents who are interested in knowing more about the college.
[time=2160] And then we have our beautiful torch magazine that now goes to 70,000 people
[time=2166] all across America free of charge every quarter.
[time=2170] And we'd like for you to pick up a sample copy and fill out one of the free subscription blanks, leave it on the table, or give it to me, or you can just write me at the college, just Paul Dixon, Cedarville College, Cedarville, Ohio, and we'll see that you get the torch coming into your home every quarter.
[time=2188] Take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to the book of Romans, Chapter 10.
[time=2194] If there is one verse in the Bible, that has been used to lead more people
[time=2202] to Christ than any other verse.
[time=2204] It is the verse that I am about to read.
[time=2208] It is found three times in the Bible.
[time=2212] The first time in the book of Joel, Chapter 2, verse 32, the second time in the book of Acts, Chapter 2, verse 21,
[time=2222] and then in Romans 10, 13.
[time=2226] As I read it, it states, "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord
[time=2232] shall be saved." I preach this message with a twofold purpose this hour,
[time=2240] number one, so that those who know not Christ might understand how they can be saved and receive Christ today.
[time=2250] Number two, so that those of us who do know Christ as our Savior,
[time=2256] might have a tool whereby we can perhaps simply explain
[time=2262] the gospel to our friends and loved ones.
[time=2264] Before I explain this verse, I like to anticipate a question.
[time=2270] Many people upon hearing the gospel respond by saying that's too simple.
[time=2276] There has to be more to it than that.
[time=2280] So let's keep a finger in Romans 10 and turn to 2 Corinthians, Chapter 11
[time=2286] for the answer to "Is the gospel too simple?" 2 Corinthians, Chapter 11.
[time=2296] The third verse, the Apostle Paul writing to those at Corinth states,
[time=2302] "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[time=2308] craftiness or subtlety, so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." Now, if you look up from your Bibles, Paul is afraid of something.
[time=2322] What is it?
[time=2324] Well, he says, "I'm fearful that by one means or another, hook or crook, just like the devil in the Garden of Eden, tricked Adam and Eve.
[time=2334] So he's going to work on your minds, the devil, boys and girls, right down here in the front, great to see you.
[time=2342] Always works on the mind." That's why the Bible says he is the father of lies.
[time=2350] That's why the Bible says there are doctrines of demons.
[time=2356] He attacks the mind.
[time=2358] And the Scripture says, in this particular passage, he works on our minds to confuse us.
[time=2366] Did you ever wonder why there are so many denominations?
[time=2370] Well, you can go into one church and they say receive Christ,
[time=2376] but that's not enough.
[time=2376] You have to be baptized too or you'll go to hell.
[time=2380] Someone else says, "Receive Christ, you don't have to be baptized, but you have to hold out into the end." And it's up to you and Christ to get you to heaven.
[time=2390] Or someone else says, "Receive Christ, but also you have to keep the law if you want to make it to heaven."
[time=2400] Gets confusing.
[time=2402] And Paul says that that's the objective of the devil to get us away from the simple gospel that salvation is all in Jesus
[time=2412] Christ and what He did for us on Calvary.
[time=2416] My friend, that's of God.
[time=2420] And whenever you hear anything else added to it, that's not of God.
[time=2424] The Scripture says that's of that old serpent, the devil.
[time=2428] With that in mind, that it is simple.
[time=2432] Let's see just how simple.
[time=2434] Go back to Romans chapter 10.
[time=2436] I want to give you a simple outline to write down or to memorize, but to take home with you this morning.
[time=2444] Number one, Romans 10, 13 gives us God's proclamation.
[time=2450] God's proclamation.
[time=2452] "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[time=2462] They tell me that Jimmy Carter had a book on his desk when he was
[time=2468] in Washington that had every promise he made to us as American
[time=2474] people when he "canadated" for that office.
[time=2480] Now what he was saying by that being on his desk is that it was his intention to keep every promise.
[time=2488] But you know, and I know, he didn't.
[time=2492] Now we have a new president from the other party.
[time=2498] And I don't know that he has a book, but I know that when he campaigned, he gave proclamations.
[time=2506] He made promises, and now he's already telling us that some of those, he's not going to be able to keep.
[time=2514] Now I don't fault President Carter, nor President Reagan,
[time=2520] because we don't have a dictatorship.
[time=2524] We have a democracy, we have a republic, and he has to work with a Senate and a House.
[time=2530] He has a Congress, and there are compromises to be made, and that's how our system works.
[time=2536] But I want you to know that when God makes a proclamation,
[time=2542] he keeps it.
[time=2544] When God gives a promise, he honors it.
[time=2548] Whenever God goes on record, you can bank on it, and he is said for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
[time=2556] What does that mean?
[time=2560] What does it mean to be saved?
[time=2562] Well, it's interesting.
[time=2562] There was a plane that crashed in South America.
[time=2568] Everyone was killed on that plane with the exception of one lady.
[time=2574] And when the rescuers were coming upon the plane, she heard them coming and started screaming.
[time=2580] And you know what she was screaming?
[time=2584] Save me.
[time=2586] Somebody rescue me.
[time=2588] Somebody deliver me.
[time=2590] Someone help me.
[time=2592] Someone save me.
[time=2594] That's what it means.
[time=2596] In fact, in Joel, if you want to check it out, it says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be delivered.
[time=2604] From what?
[time=2610] The pilot flew into Fort Wayne this morning.
[time=2612] The pilot was Don Allen, one of our graduates.
[time=2616] We were in the school plane.
[time=2618] And we were flying through clouds.
[time=2622] He likes to call it soup.
[time=2626] And at about 5,000 feet, we broke through the clouds.
[time=2630] You talk about a beautiful morning.
[time=2634] That sun shining.
[time=2636] Above those clouds, it was so peaceful.
[time=2638] I felt so secure.
[time=2640] Now if I would have been flying, I would have needed rescuing.
[time=2644] Delivering.
[time=2646] But with Don, everything was fine.
[time=2650] You feel secure this morning?
[time=2652] Everything's going well.
[time=2654] What do you need rescuing from?
[time=2658] Hell.
[time=2662] My friend, you die in your sin and you'll go to hell.
[time=2668] I am preaching to scores of people this hour who are in danger of losing your eternal souls.
[time=2678] You say I don't believe in hell.
[time=2682] Well, you're like a lady who was in a meeting that I was preaching in Ohio.
[time=2686] I gave the invitation.
[time=2688] People were responding.
[time=2690] This lady came forward and she didn't stop with the pastor right up to the platform.
[time=2696] I stuck my hand out.
[time=2698] I didn't know what was coming.
[time=2700] It was most unusual.
[time=2700] I said as I usually do, why are you coming?
[time=2704] She said I'm coming to tell you I disagree with everything you said.
[time=2708] Now that's unique.
[time=2710] It doesn't happen every service and I'm glad.
[time=2716] I said specifically, what bothered you?
[time=2720] What troubled you?
[time=2722] I said you preached on hell and I don't believe in hell.
[time=2726] I said I'll tell you what I'll do.
[time=2730] I will meet you in the pastor's study to talk about it after the service.
[time=2734] She said fine.
[time=2736] She was waiting.
[time=2736] She was loaded.
[time=2738] She was ready for bear.
[time=2740] I walked in.
[time=2740] We sat down.
[time=2742] Her first response.
[time=2744] I want you to know.
[time=2746] The only thing I believe in the Bible is what's in red letters.
[time=2752] That's different.
[time=2756] I said let me make sure I understand you correctly.
[time=2758] You only believe a red letter addition of the Bible and that that's in red.
[time=2764] Right?
[time=2764] Right.
[time=2766] You see what she's saying?
[time=2766] There are red letter additions to the Bible.
[time=2768] Some of you boys and girls may have them and that means that everything Jesus said is in red.
[time=2774] Now it's all the word of God but especially in the gospels when Jesus was upon this earth
[time=2780] and he would speak they'd put it in red.
[time=2782] I said lady that's all I want to use.
[time=2784] I won't use anything in black letters.
[time=2788] Today I will just use everything in red letters for you.
[time=2790] Even though I believe the red and the black, I'll just use the red.
[time=2794] You know why I could say that?
[time=2798] Because the word hell is found 24 times in the New Testament and Jesus used it 22 of the 24 times.
[time=2806] No one preached so much about hell and judgment and condemnation and wrath as the Son of God.
[time=2812] You can't have one without the other if you believe in Jesus.
[time=2816] You have to believe there's a hell and my friend there is and you need rescuing from it.
[time=2822] That's not all.
[time=2826] Too many times we have the idea you get saved and that's for heaven.
[time=2832] No, no.
[time=2834] I'm preaching to people here this morning who need their homes saved.
[time=2840] Your family's rescued.
[time=2842] Husbands and wives who are at odds with one another.
[time=2850] Your home is in shambles.
[time=2852] Parents are having serious difficulty with your young people, young people with your parents.
[time=2858] I want you to know when Jesus comes in there's hope for that home.
[time=2864] There's help for that home.
[time=2866] Christ is in the family saving business and you don't have to wait until you get to heaven to experience that.
[time=2876] He's also in the life saving business.
[time=2878] There are people here this morning who could stand and tell you how Christ changed their lives.
[time=2884] We have a lot of exciting things at the college but I'm obviously into athletics and I'm a strong supporter of our athletic program.
[time=2896] We have tremendous teams, men and women.
[time=2900] We in the NAIA went to the Nationals in basketball last year in Kansas City.
[time=2904] We've gone to the Nationals in tennis 11 out of the last 13 years.
[time=2908] We went to the Nationals in golf two out of the last three years.
[time=2912] And we just started our new basketball season.
[time=2916] Our new athletic center.
[time=2918] 70,000 square feet tenth of a mile indoor track.
[time=2922] Three racquetball courts tremendous facility.
[time=2924] We had 2,000 people there last night.
[time=2928] 75 piece bet ban.
[time=2930] And you've never had an experience like being in a Cedarville college ball game.
[time=2934] It is something else.
[time=2936] But we had our own invitational tournament and we won it.
[time=2942] And we really didn't pick off soft teams either at a tough game last night.
[time=2946] Muskingum College or NCAA Division III.
[time=2952] But one of the reasons we have that tournament is we bring in these teams.
[time=2956] And right before the training hour, the training dinner three o'clock yesterday afternoon,
[time=2962] we got them in a room and I said, "Guys, I want to tell you how to be saved." And I stood up there before, I don't know, 50, 60, managers, players, coaches,
[time=2972] athletic directors and gave them the gospel.
[time=2976] And six guys raised their hands and said, "Pray for me, I need to be saved." Five from one team.
[time=2982] It's a tremendous time of interaction. I'm praying that they will be saved.
[time=2986] But during the game, halftime, Coach Callan came over to me and he said,
[time=2992] "One of the athletic directors says that this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to him being here."
[time=2998] He said, "He can't believe what he's witnessing.
[time=3000] Why don't you go over and talk to him? I didn't have time." And I went over and he shared this with me.
[time=3004] He said, "Paul, I got saved two years ago." He said, "I just got married in June." He said, "It's great to be married, but I want you to know that Jesus Christ has changed my life."
[time=3018] He's in the life-saving business as well as the soul-saving business and the family-saving business.
[time=3026] But how do you get something so good?
[time=3028] We see God's proclamation, what's God's proposition?
[time=3032] Well, let's look at the verse.
[time=3034] "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, gets it. Shall be saved."
[time=3040] Now, I want you to notice, boys and girls, what it doesn't say.
[time=3044] Check me out in your Bibles. Does it say, "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the church, shall be saved"?
[time=3050] Does it say that? No.
[time=3054] But how many people have you met? Are you saved? I'm a Catholic.
[time=3060] Are you saved? I'm a Presbyterian.
[time=3064] Are you saved? I'm a Lutheran. Are you saved? I'm a Baptist.
[time=3072] Baptist.
[time=3076] I have patience with our Roman Catholic friends.
[time=3080] I have patience with our Lutheran friends and our Methodist friends and our Presbyterian friends, but I don't have any patience with you, Baptist.
[time=3088] Who in the world ever heard of a Baptist going to heaven because he was a Baptist?
[time=3096] A Baptist church never saved anyone. The Black Hawk Baptist Church, I remember when the church was started,
[time=3102] I held the first evangelistic meeting in this church.
[time=3108] But this church has not saved anyone since the day it started to this day, and it never will.
[time=3114] This church, no church, can save you. It's not whosoever shall call upon the name of the church,
[time=3120] yet how many people think they're going to heaven because they're church members?
[time=3124] Doesn't say whosoever shall call upon their own name shall be saved either.
[time=3132] If I say, "Johnny Bench"?
[time=3136] You know why you know the name Johnny Bench? A name is who you are and what you've done.
[time=3142] If I say Kenny Anderson, obviously you can tell I'm partial to Cincinnati.
[time=3146] Kenny Anderson, you know who that is because of who he is and what he's done.
[time=3152] A lot of people think they're going to heaven because of who they are and what they've done.
[time=3158] I don't care who you are. I was recently, two weeks ago, speaking in a church and in walked
[time=3164] United States Senator from that state.
[time=3170] Fine. It's a privilege to preach to him.
[time=3174] It was an honor to talk to him after the service.
[time=3178] But that's not going to get him to heaven.
[time=3180] I don't care what your name is. I don't care who you are.
[time=3184] It's not your name. The scripture says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=3190] Shall be saved to who he is and what he's done.
[time=3194] Jesus Christ the Son of God who shed his blood on the cross for you and for me.
[time=3202] A rose from the dead and it's this Christ and only this Christ who can forgive you
[time=3208] and save you and take you to heaven.
[time=3210] But you notice you have to call?
[time=3216] There has to come a time in your life when you say I need help.
[time=3220] I am a sinner and in repenting a change of heart and mind about that sin you turn
[time=3226] to this Christ who died for you and who lives.
[time=3230] And you call out into him in hope and faith.
[time=3234] And you call out into him from your innermost being from your heart.
[time=3238] Oh God I'm a sinner and I know you died for me and I want you to come into my heart and forgive my sin and save my soul right now.
[time=3248] That's God's proposition.
[time=3252] But who can do this? God's perimeter.
[time=3258] This building has an outreach. It has a perimeter wherever the walls would touch.
[time=3264] The question is what is the outreach of the gospel?
[time=3268] What is the perimeter of the gospel?
[time=3270] Who can be saved? Answer.
[time=3272] The verse says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=3276] Shall be saved. Teenager that means if you are in the depths of sin you're on drugs.
[time=3284] You're in alcohol.
[time=3286] You're living a loose life.
[time=3288] You can be one of the whosoever's today.
[time=3290] That means if you are a teenager who never would use profanity has never touched a drop of liquor.
[time=3300] Never been on drugs. Never committed illicit sex. You can be saved today.
[time=3308] Those in the depths of sin. Those in their morality and self-righteousness whosoever.
[time=3314] Those who are church members but never saved can be saved today.
[time=3318] Those who've never darkened the door of a church or perhaps would be in this service for the first time ever being in a church in your life.
[time=3326] You can be saved today whosoever means the old and it means the young.
[time=3338] I remember preaching the ordination of a friend. His name was Weldon.
[time=3344] He invited me to go to North Carolina and preach that ordination and I did and I sat in on the questioning.
[time=3352] And the first question is Weldon, when did you get saved? He said when I was six.
[time=3356] I was attending a revival meeting with my father and every night the deacons would get together in a room
[time=3366] and they would pray for people to be saved and I'd kneel right next to my daddy.
[time=3372] One night I was praying next to my daddy for people to get saved and all of a sudden it hit me.
[time=3376] And you're not saved? I determined I was going to get saved that night and I walked out
[time=3382] and the preacher preached the gospel and he gave the invitation and I walked down the aisle and received Jesus Christ as my Savior and was saved when I was six years old and I'll never forget it.
[time=3392] After he gave that testimony, another preacher raised his hand and said, "Weldon, you're 31 years old. That was 25 years ago. Don't you doubt you were saved when you were six?"
[time=3404] And you'd have to know Weldon. Not many people can say this.
[time=3408] Weldon looked at that man and said, "Sir, I have never doubted my salvation one time."
[time=3418] Because he said, "Sir, there are only two things necessary for salvation. Number one, a willing sinner."
[time=3428] Number two, a capable Savior. When I was six years old, I was willing, Jesus was capable.
[time=3438] He forgave my sin, saved my soul, and I don't have to die. Isn't that great?
[time=3448] It's just that simple. And what I would like to encourage everyone of you to do
[time=3456] is to take advantage of that glorious, great offer of salvation this hour.
[time=3464] Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved right now in this auditorium
[time=3472] and right now watching over television bow your head and receive Christ today.
[time=3478] Would you bow with me all over the auditorium?
[time=3482] With every head bowed and every eye closed, I want to ask you this question.
[time=3486] Do you know that if you died right now you would go to heaven?
[time=3492] Can you say beyond any shadow of a doubt?
