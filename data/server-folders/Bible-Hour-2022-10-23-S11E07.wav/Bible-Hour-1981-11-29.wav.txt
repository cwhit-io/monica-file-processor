[time=78] - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=90] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=97] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=107] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=112] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=124] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=133] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center
[time=139] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=142] - Good morning and welcome to our morning worship service
[time=149] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=152] Earlier this morning, many of us gathered for an early morning worship service and what an encouragement it was to hear the special music of our choir and our guest today, Steve and Barbara Musto.
[time=164] And I know that this hour will be a special encouragement to you.
[time=168] We have as our speaker today, Dr. John Valleo of Clark Summit Baptist Bible College.
[time=174] He'll be sharing a message with us today about the life of Judas.
[time=179] I know it'll be a tremendous encouragement to you today.
[time=182] We welcome you this morning and say a special good morning and welcome to our many friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=189] We hope that today's service will be a note of praise within your heart.
[time=194] It begins with our choir leading us as they sing for us, Hallelujah, what a savior.
[time=200] They're under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=204] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=365] Hallelujah, what a savior.
[time=379] The word hallelujah means to praise the Lord.
[time=384] We have a special treat today in that our children's choir is coming to sing for us.
[time=390] The scripture says, train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=394] And when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=398] It is good that we have a program of training children music that they might learn early in life to sing praises unto God.
[time=406] We counted a real privilege in our church that we have a children's program.
[time=411] And they've been under the constant teaching and good direction of Mrs. Diane Medert.
[time=417] And this morning she'll be playing the piano and Mr. Don Kruger, our minister of music, will be leading them as they sing.
[time=424] Our children's choir, all of God's children singing, hallelujah.
[time=429] [MUSIC]
[time=435] Lord, we thank You, hallelujah.
[time=475] Hallelujah.
[time=481] Lord, we praise You, hallelujah.
[time=538] [APPLAUSE]
[time=551] Thank you, young men and women.
[time=553] We appreciate your music and your talent that you've dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=559] I'm sure that we have a few extra grandmothers either here today or watching by television, looking for the smiling face of their proud little one.
[time=569] We have special guests with us today, Steve and Barbara Musto.
[time=572] They have a talent of music and they share it often across our country.
[time=577] We're fortunate to have them.
[time=579] We're fortunate to have them with us today.
[time=582] They come to sing for us at this time, hand in hand.
[time=585] There has never been a friend like Jesus.
[time=597] I have never found a friend so true.
[time=605] When I'm weak, and then my steps grow wayward,
[time=614] then He comes to me with strength anew.
[time=621] We will stand in hand through this pilgrim land,
[time=633] here in the far of day.
[time=641] But so will leave this land of night.
[time=649] For that land is so bright, there by Lord and light, we'll stay.
[time=670] Let me recommend this friend so faithful.
[time=677] We will understand your deepest need.
[time=688] For he walked this lonesome path before us,
[time=696] and his able every step to lead.
[time=705] We will stand in hand through this pilgrim land,
[time=720] here in the far of day.
[time=729] But so will leave this land of night.
[time=737] For that land is so bright, there by Lord and light,
[time=753] we will stay.
[time=764] Hello, and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=774] I have my good friend Don Kruger with me this morning.
[time=777] And each week, we look forward to this time of just taking a few minutes to talk personally with our television viewers.
[time=786] Don, how are you today?
[time=787] Fine.
[time=788] Had a good Thanksgiving and enjoyed the few days with my family.
[time=791] How about you?
[time=792] Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
[time=793] Only I ate too much.
[time=794] I don't know whether you ever do this, but we ate with my family at 12 and two hours later, we're eating with my wife's family, so I've got some dieting to do in the next few days.
[time=804] Same here.
[time=806] We have several special guests with us today.
[time=809] We've already met Steve and Barbara Musto.
[time=812] Don't they have a tremendous ability to communicate biblical truth through the ministry of singing?
[time=818] We're going to hear from them later in the service today, and I know that their ministry of music will be a special encouragement to your heart.
[time=825] They blessed my heart already today.
[time=827] Don, we have a special guest coming to speak for us today too, don't we?
[time=831] Dr. Ballio is a dear brother and a tremendous communicator of the gospel.
[time=837] He was the pastor of the Cedar Hill Baptist Church in Cleveland for 19 years.
[time=841] He is now the professor of Bible at Grand Rapids at Clark Summit, Baptist Bible College
[time=848] and a tremendous speaker and I'm looking forward to him.
[time=851] I am too.
[time=852] We are very fortunate to have both Dr. Ballio here today and the Musto's, and I know that's
[time=858] going to mean a very special time for you and I as we watch the Bible hour today.
[time=863] The God could use that ministry to encourage our hearts.
[time=867] I'd like just to take a few minutes to give you some good news, some encouragement about what the Bible hour is doing in people's lives.
[time=875] You remember last Sunday, Dr. Paul Dixon from Cedarville College was here and spoke.
[time=880] The next day on Monday, a lady from our church was visiting a friend and she said, "I was
[time=886] watching your church on television yesterday and what a tremendous message that Dr. Dixon
[time=892] had." And they began to talk back and forth and before the discussion was ended, the lady from our church had the opportunity to share personally how Jesus Christ could help her friend so she
[time=903] could know she had eternal life.
[time=905] And Dawn, right there in the kitchen, she invited Christ into her heart.
[time=909] Now that's what it's all about, isn't it, Pastor Rick?
[time=912] It really is.
[time=913] And those things happen from time to time and we hardly ever get to find out but what a special encouragement it is when someone calls and lets us know that a friend accepted Christ or someone who was sick was encouraged by the ministry of the Word of God.
[time=927] We want to encourage you to write in.
[time=929] Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=935] The zip code is 46815.
[time=939] And we have a booklet to share, don't we, Dawn?
[time=941] Yes, the booklet is the one that we've been sharing in the last few weeks and you have been very responsive about it but there are still probably people who have not written in and asked for this book by our own Dr. Ken Nichols Remedies for negative thinking.
[time=954] It's a tremendous little practical little book.
[time=957] It is from God's point of view.
[time=960] Many times we in our counseling say, well, this is what the book says or this is what we think you should do.
[time=965] This book says this is what God says to do.
[time=969] If you have problems with negative thinking or friends who have such problems and you'd like to share some of God's Remedies with them, you get this little book, Remedies for negative thinking.
[time=979] Write to us the Bible hour, that's box 15,00015,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=989] We'd love to send this book to you.
[time=992] The reason why we've been sharing this same booklet with you week after week is because so many people have been writing in and wanting a copy of Dr. Ken's booklet, Remedies for
[time=1002] negative thinking.
[time=1003] So write today if you would like a copy.
[time=1006] If you recall last week, we introduced you to another friend of ours, Mr. Ed Ward, who will be the director, hopefully the director of the Bible hour prayer counseling line.
[time=1017] That is a new ministry that we're hoping to begin with your help on January the 1st.
[time=1023] What that would allow to happen would be for someone who's watching the Bible hour and senses a spiritual need in their life, perhaps they want to accept Jesus Christ, but they need some personal help, or it may be that they have a problem in their own life with
[time=1038] a mate, with one of their children, and they'd like someone to pray with them, someone to talk with them, someone who can point out the appropriate verses in the Bible.
[time=1048] We want to have the Bible hour prayer counseling line to help those type of people.
[time=1053] In order to do that and to add a new expense to this ministry, we need to raise $20,000
[time=1059] during the month of November.
[time=1061] Now don't misunderstand, the counseling line won't cost that much.
[time=1065] What we're saying is we need to meet our current expenses before we have the freedom to add more expenses, and during the month of November, the cost of the Bible hour is in excess of $20,000.
[time=1077] Wouldn't you consider helping us, maybe writing today and sending some financial help for the Bible hour, and allow this ministry to continue not only as it is, but allow it to grow and allow us to add the Bible hour prayer counseling line.
[time=1092] Don, how can someone use that line?
[time=1095] Well, when they feel the need or the urge to call us, they simply do that between the hours of 8 a.m. in the morning and 1 p.m. on Sundays only, and then 6 in the evening
[time=1107] to 9 p.m.
[time=1109] I know it's been true in my life when God has spoken to me through a message.
[time=1113] If I do something immediately about it, some kind of response or some kind of promise to the Lord, that's always very effective in my own life.
[time=1121] And so we find the need for people to do that, so that if when God is speaking to your heart through the ministry of the Bible hour, Pastor Rick or one of our guest speakers, you pick up your phone, and it's between the hours of 8 or 1 p.m., Sunday mornings, we'll have
[time=1135] people there who can talk to you and help you with your own spiritual needs.
[time=1139] And once again, that will begin in January.
[time=1143] So wait for the day of January before you look for a number to call.
[time=1146] But then you call if we could help you.
[time=1149] Wouldn't it be great if people who wanted to know Christ a Savior could simply pick up their telephone and call and talk to a train counselor who could share with them from God's Word how they can have eternal life?
[time=1161] Once you consider helping making that possible and helping the Bible hour with its current expenses, write to us today.
[time=1168] Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1176] Thank you for joining us again today, and now we're going to return to the service with Stephen Barbara Musto, singing for us again.
[time=1194] And I know God, my Savior, my family, for my mercy Lord, for me, as in paths of righteousness,
[time=1208] my soul out of the store again, and me, at me in fastest grade, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm
[time=1220] crazy with a soul, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=1245] I wish of what I love in kindness, I wish of what I love in kindness, I wish for
[time=1273] what I love in kindness, I wish of what I love in kindness, I wish of what I love in
[time=1295] kindness, I shall exalt my name oh Lord, I shall exalt me, I pray to sing, I shall
[time=1315] exalt me, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=1319] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=1345] Amen, we've had a good morning of praise songs, hallelujah, hallelujah, and now Barbara
[time=1360] is going to sing for us a final note of praise this morning, a very, very popular and well-written
[time=1367] musical number that she sings so well, praise the Lord.
[time=1384] When you're up against a struggle that shatters all your dreams and your hopes have been cruelly
[time=1393] crushed by Satan's manifested schemes, and you feel the urge within you to submit to
[time=1402] earthly fears, don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear, praise the Lord, he
[time=1415] can work with those who praise him, praise the Lord, for God in habits, praise, praise
[time=1426] the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you, serve only to remind you that they've
[time=1433] got powerless behind you when you praise him, now Satan is a liar and he wants to make us
[time=1447] think that we are paupers when he knows himself, we're children of the king, so lift up the
[time=1456] mighty shield of faith, the battle must be won, we know that Jesus Christ is risen, so
[time=1463] the work's already done, praise the Lord, he can work with those who praise him, praise
[time=1473] the Lord, for God in habits, praise, praise the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind
[time=1483] you, serve only to remind you that they've got powerless behind you when you praise him,
[time=1494] praise him, when you praise him, when you praise him, when you praise him, the Lord,
[time=1521] thank you, that was good preparation for our hearts as we now turn our attention to God's
[time=1542] Word, God has sent us his messenger today, Dr. John Bauyo, Dr. Bauyo was a pastor for
[time=1549] many many years in Cleveland, Ohio, most recently he is a member of the faculty of Clark Summit
[time=1555] Baptist College in Clark Summit, Pennsylvania, we're appreciating his presence today and
[time=1561] I know that his message will be a special encouragement to your hearts today, Dr. John Bauyo.
[time=1575] Special delight to be here and enjoy this tremendous music by Stephen Barbara Musto,
[time=1582] it was a great day for me and a lot of other people when I found out I couldn't sing, I
[time=1589] didn't always know that, I went to see a man in the hospital once and thought I'd cheer
[time=1595] him up, so I sang to him and when I finished I was telling him goodbye and I said I hope
[time=1602] you get better, he said you too, I don't think the Mustos need to get any better, the greatest
[time=1612] thing God ever made was human personality, far greater than flaming suns or shining
[time=1619] stars, planets hanging in space, one human being, made in God's image, it's why it's
[time=1630] such a tragic thing to take human personality and squander it, make junk out of it.
[time=1638] Because God made us in his image nobody is a nobody, nobody's junk, even a man without
[time=1645] Christ is worth saving, everybody is worth salvaging.
[time=1651] In presenting truth God has marched across the stage of history of various personalities,
[time=1658] some of them are God's tall men who bother magnificent lives challenge us to go that
[time=1664] road and live that life, you have a record of people like that in Hebrews chapter 11,
[time=1672] some people however are red lights flashing, God warning us not to live that way, not
[time=1679] to go that road, and such a man is Judas, perhaps one of the most tragic personalities
[time=1687] in all of the Bible is Judas, we read about him not only in the gospels but also in the
[time=1693] book of Acts chapter 1, this is just prior to Pentecost, and Peter is talking about Judas,
[time=1701] he says man and brothers the Scriptures must needs have been fulfilled which was spoken before by the prophet David concerning Judas who was guide to them who took Jesus, for
[time=1715] he was once numbered with us, how interesting the juxtaposition of those sentences, those
[time=1724] words, he was guide to them but once he belonged to our company, that procession that came
[time=1733] up the pathway into the garden of Gethsemane, these soldiers who came to take Jesus prisoner,
[time=1742] this company of unbelievers, these hostile to the Son of God was led by Judas, and yet
[time=1748] Peter reminds us that on one occasion he had been numbered with that great company of the apostles, the most elite company in all the world, who would not have been honored
[time=1759] to have been counted among Peter and James and John and Nathaniel and all the rest of them that we know as the apostles of Jesus Christ, he once marched with the apostles but
[time=1770] he changed over to the drumbeat of hell, what did he do it, what was his motivation, what
[time=1778] caused him to move from the society of the apostles to the company of the damned, well
[time=1786] he did it for thirty pieces of silver, do you ever stop to wonder why people want money,
[time=1793] I think for the average person money is synonymous with happiness, you know if I have a lot of
[time=1799] money I'll be happy, now they interpret that happiness variously, they may think well
[time=1808] I can buy everything I like, money means possessions and possessions means happiness, for some people
[time=1816] it is prestige, you know I'll have status if I have money, I'll be looked up to, I'll be admired and so I want money because I want prestige, for some people it's power,
[time=1828] if I just had enough money I could do whatever I wanted to do, I would have power, somebody
[time=1836] was asked once who had a lot of money if it made him happy, he said well it makes me powerfully independent, what he meant was it is power, it is that, I saw a celebrity
[time=1847] being interviewed on television in one occasion and the interviewer asked this well-known lady
[time=1853] what she desired most of all in the world for her daughter and she thought a minute she responded happiness and then she added a question, isn't that what we're here for,
[time=1867] well I don't think so, as far as I know a pig in the mud with a son on his back is happy
[time=1874] and cows are contented, they tell me, I suppose it's true I never heard of one having a breakdown
[time=1882] I think maybe we ought to be here for something more than pigs and cows, I'm not suggesting
[time=1888] of course that God wants us to be miserable, God didn't make us to be unhappy but at the same time there must be something more to life than simply happiness, in fact happiness
[time=1899] is a by-product, it's something you stumble over on the right road, it's something God
[time=1905] throws in, it is not something you live for, you live for God, you will be happy, you live
[time=1911] for happiness and you will be unhappy, I've heard people say well you know I just do as I please, well you keep on doing it pretty soon you won't be pleased with what you're doing because that kind of philosophy of life always leads to sadness and gloom, Judas
[time=1926] has been offered of course a great potential in Jesus Christ, Peter mentions that when
[time=1932] he said he had obtained part of this ministry, what ministry, apostolic ministry, the privilege
[time=1939] of presenting God's truth to a lost and needy and perishing world, the privilege of representing
[time=1945] the God of the stars and the God of salvation, the privilege of going out as the personal
[time=1951] representative of Jesus Christ, that's no small matter and certainly the compensations
[time=1959] for it would not be a small matter in this life or in the world to come, but Judas rejected
[time=1965] the offer of Jesus Christ and thought he was buying happiness, but what he really was buying
[time=1972] was a miserable life, his own suicide and the perdition that followed it.
[time=1981] I think maybe we ought to remind ourselves that all of the punishment we get in a world to come we purchased in this life, everything Judas bought with the wages of iniquity he
[time=1992] deserved for we reap what we sow.
[time=1998] Do you ever wonder why Judas committed suicide?
[time=2003] I've just sat at times and meditated on what was it that propelled him out across the valley
[time=2011] of the Kidron up the other side in order to take his own life?
[time=2015] After all he got what he wanted, didn't he?
[time=2018] He wanted money, he got his 30 pieces of silver, why wasn't he satisfied?
[time=2023] What was it that drove him to despair?
[time=2028] Well Judas knew of course that Jesus was innocent.
[time=2032] He cried when he brought back the 30 pieces of silver and tried to return him to the priest.
[time=2036] I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood.
[time=2043] Judas was suffocated with guilt because he knew the claims of Christ were true.
[time=2048] I'm quite sure after he had done his dastardly deed that he remembered the life, the messages,
[time=2054] the ministry of Jesus Christ, indeed he could not forget.
[time=2059] He would have remembered for instance that time when he was with the other disciples in a little boat on the Sea of Galilee.
[time=2066] We call it a sea, it's really a lake, 13 miles by 7 miles, it's sort of like a little
[time=2072] saucer hills round about, all around, not high hills but just ring the little lake.
[time=2079] The winds whipped down sometimes with sudden gust and they whipped that lake into a wild fury and on very short notice the waves can be wild and lives can be in jeopardy.
[time=2091] It was so on this occasion.
[time=2094] These men were used to the Sea of Galilee but they were afraid and they come rushing to Jesus who was asleep in the back part of the boat and they cried, "Master don't you care
[time=2105] that we perish?" And Jesus stood up and rebuked the wind, quite literally it reads, "He muzzled the wind.
[time=2113] This strong wind that was blowing and creating tossing waves died down and the waves that
[time=2120] were curled up high and threatening the boat now curled up like little dogs who were being a master and lay quietly at the feet of Jesus and Judas remembered." Oh yes, he would have remembered.
[time=2131] He would have remembered the time that Jesus went into the home of a little girl.
[time=2136] A man had urged Jesus to come because his little girl was sick.
[time=2141] Before Christ got there the girl had died.
[time=2144] Some suggested they do not go any further but he said, "Just believe, just trust."
[time=2150] When they go into the little girl's room and those mourners on the outside mock him when he said, "She's not dead, she's sleeping," sleeping as a word for "Christian dead."
[time=2162] She was indeed physically dead.
[time=2165] In Christ with Peter, James and John walk into the room with a parents, "Bottie of a little girl, now corpse, lying on the bed, newly dead, no doubt still warm, but dead."
[time=2179] When Christ reaches out the hand of love and compassion and omnipotence, and life leaps from the fingers of the Son of God to the corpse of a little girl, and she rises.
[time=2190] And Christ said, "Give her something to eat, she's hungry." I'd like to see the faces of those mourners as Jesus and Peter and James and John and the
[time=2200] parents walked out of the room and pass that company again the little girl was there alive.
[time=2207] And Judas was on the outside too, knowing she had died, knowing she was raised again, and knowing Jesus had raised her.
[time=2214] Oh yes, Judas would have remembered.
[time=2217] He would have remembered the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=2220] The Bible is quite clear that they often, as the Bible says, resorted thither, that is, they often went to the garden.
[time=2229] This was a time quite frequently when Jesus would spend intimately with his disciples.
[time=2236] And Judas would listen to the rise and fall of the voice of the Son of God as he heard
[time=2242] the sound of the wind and the trees.
[time=2244] And he would have spoken of God, heaven and eternity and forgiveness and life.
[time=2252] And Judas' heart would have burned within him.
[time=2255] But he resisted all of the entreaties of Christ and the messages of Christ and the miracles
[time=2261] of Christ and hardened himself against the invitations of the Savior, not only to him
[time=2267] but to others.
[time=2268] Oh yes, he would have remembered.
[time=2271] He would have remembered all those miracles when the blinds were made to see and lepers were cleansed and the lame walked and the dead raised he would remember.
[time=2283] Now the memory scorches his conscience and he rushes out up the hill, takes that little
[time=2291] sash or belt girdle it's called around his waist which was used of course to tie up the
[time=2297] loose flowing tunic of the wearer hung himself on a tree.
[time=2304] That sash wasn't made to support human weight, doubtlessly it broke immediately.
[time=2309] And he fell impaled on the rocks below and Peter puts it very plainly.
[time=2314] He was so ripped open that all of his bowels gushed out.
[time=2319] You see the tragic sight of Judas, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.
[time=2328] Interesting isn't it that the last words of Judas validates the claim of Christ as to whom he was.
[time=2336] Christ said I am the father of one, you couldn't say that.
[time=2341] He said if you've seen me you've seen the father, no mere human being could ever say that.
[time=2346] He said I'm the way no man comes to the father but by me I can say I will show you the way to God I cannot say I am the road to God.
[time=2356] You see Christ claimed to be God and he was crucified on the charge of blasphemy.
[time=2364] Oh I know the charge later on before the political authorities was treason but that was not the original charge of the real one which means of course that if Judas had turned in a guilty
[time=2376] person one guilty of blasphemy he would have been obeying Old Testament law.
[time=2383] After all in the Old Testament a man who was guilty of blasphemy had committed a capital
[time=2389] crime and Judas would have said you know this man is a blasphema, I've turned him in, I've obeyed Old Testament law, I've done what's right he certainly would have felt no guilt about it but Judas dying words were it is innocent blood.
[time=2408] Judas himself validates the claims of Christ as to his identity.
[time=2416] Some of you may say well you know I have, I've heard about Christianity, I've heard the gospel, also I've observed some Christians and I've been in some churches and I've been
[time=2427] disappointed in some Christians, I've been disappointed in some churches, well it's understandable
[time=2434] because in a way churches are like hospitals we don't come called we're well, we come to
[time=2440] get healed, we come to be made better, we come not only to be saved but to make progress
[time=2446] in Christianity, I notice also that many times when folks are disappointed in Christians they don't pull out, as an example some noble character like the Apostle Paul they'll find
[time=2457] some little sick sheep somewhere and compare himself to him and say you know I'm better
[time=2463] than he is but so suppose some of the best at times have disappointed you, whatever you
[time=2472] may say about some of Christ's followers, one thing you can never say is that you've been disappointed in Jesus, Christ has never failed, we sing it sometimes don't we, Jesus
[time=2485] never fails, Jesus never fails and he never has, I've known many a person to say I wish
[time=2492] I'd come to Christ sooner, I've never heard anybody say I'm sorry I came to Christ for
[time=2499] salvation, Jesus indeed never fails, I suppose some day as you stand in the presence of
[time=2507] Christ if you're without the Son of God the thing that will burn your conscience and sear your soul is the fact that you've rejected him, you know John in Revelation tells us that he saw in heaven the Lord Jesus as a lamb, a lamb as it had been slain which means
[time=2525] the marks of Calvary are still upon the incarnate Son of God and some day you will stand in
[time=2532] the presence of incarnate love with the marks of his compassion still upon you and a thing
[time=2539] that will burn your soul like codes of fire is that you would not have him, we Christians
[time=2548] sometimes sing Fanny Crosby's well-known song Safe in the Arms of Jesus, safe on his
[time=2555] gentle breasts, thereby his love or shaded, sweetly my soul should rest, heart to the voice of
[time=2564] angels born in a song to me over the fields of glory and over the jaspous sea but not
[time=2573] for Judas, if Judas said anything it all be over the field so bloody and over the burning
[time=2580] sea. Peter is talking about Judas in Acts when he says concerning him, I think one of
[time=2590] the most frightening awesome things in all of scripture, he said Judas by transgression
[time=2597] fell that he might go to his own place, what do you mean his own place? Well Judas carved
[time=2610] out an eternity of place that is compatible with the life he lived with the decisions
[time=2616] he made with the person he became, he went to his own place. As I read that I couldn't
[time=2624] help but think of the words of the Lord Jesus Christ when he said to his disciples in John chapter 14, "Just prior now you understand the Calvary, don't be troubled because I said
[time=2635] I'm leaving, after all I am going to prepare a place for you." His own place, the place
[time=2645] you prepare for yourself an eternity or the place Christ is preparing for those who believe
[time=2651] in him. We sometimes say it a prepared place for prepared people. In the book of John chapter
[time=2659] 1 we read that all things were made by him, without him was not anything made that was made. Let's put it very simply, Jesus Christ is the world's creator. He made the stars,
[time=2670] the planets, the flowers, the butterflies, the grass, the trees, he's the creator of the universe. Now he is the one who's preparing another place, a place for us. Say he did
[time=2684] pretty well when he made this world, didn't he? World terrifically complicated, fabulous in beauty, vast in dimensions, in many ways incomprehensible. We brag about what we know.
[time=2700] God has made a universe so great that we don't know anything about any one thing, everything
[time=2706] about any one thing. We certainly don't even know something about everything. All we know is some things about some things. And what a universe it is. Whether you look at it telescopically
[time=2718] or microscopically, you realize you can go out on a cloudless night and look up into the
[time=2724] sky and see stars 800,000 miles away with light traveling about 186,000 miles per second.
[time=2733] Fabulous universe. You don't have to look through a telescope. God has made even little
[time=2740] things marvelously. Do you ever look at a butterfly, the beauty of its wings, the symmetry of its
[time=2749] wings, the engineering that went into it? And did you ever take a butterfly's wing and
[time=2755] feel the wing and fuzz comes off in your fingers? Do you know they've discovered that
[time=2762] all that fuzz is multiplied thousands of feathers? These are all tiny feathers. Quite
[time=2773] a world God has made. Jesus Christ has created. You know even worms are remarkable? You say,
[time=2785] "Well, worms aren't my favorite subject." I studied worms in a laboratory in university,
[time=2792] heard about one girl who said that she was in lab studying worms. She says, "I've learned more about worms than I ever wanted to know." But they are fascinating. You know worm has a nervous system and two brains in its little head? Did you know that you can cut off a
[time=2808] worm's head and it will grow another one? And remember what it had with the old head?
[time=2818] But it's true. And snakes are fascinating. Women don't like them. But they're still
[time=2827] fascinating. You know what a snake is doing when he sticks his tongue out? He's not really
[time=2833] being rude, you know. What he's doing, he's bringing air in over his old factory organ,
[time=2839] or we say it crudely, he's got his nose and his mouth. And he brings an air so he can smell. By the way, some snakes have heat pits. They respond to body warmth and they hunt
[time=2854] by means of this heat pit as they get closer to the prey and the grass. And then they can
[time=2861] sense the heat of the animal. God's made a remarkable world. It seems to me that as
[time=2870] you look about the universe, you ought to be interested in the world that Christ is preparing.
[time=2874] The heaven he's getting ready for believers. Some measure at least God has given us some
[time=2880] indication of the glory and the beauty of it. C.S. Lewis said that music is spoken of as being in heaven because more than anything else, music comes close to expressing the inexpressible.
[time=2892] And heaven can't be fully expressed to us. Now we'll have to experience it. And all this imagery that is used of heaven, walls of jasper and gates of pearl and streets of gold
[time=2902] and tree of healing and the lamb is the light and the temple of it. All of the language
[time=2908] that God has given to stimulate our imaginations, to let you know something of the glory and the purity and the beauty of a new Jerusalem. But you just won't be in that place. He went
[time=2920] to his own place. He was a man of sin. He goes to a place where sinners will be. He was
[time=2926] a man of shame. He'll go to a place of shame. He was a child of darkness. He will go into out of darkness. He was a man of wickedness. He shall suffer the punishment of a holy God. For those of us who have received Christ as Lord and Savior, God has forgiven us. God
[time=2943] has changed us. Someday God will transport us and we will be compatible with the place He's been preparing for us. It's a place of light. We've been made children of light, translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love. Our shame has been removed. We've been made now the sons of God, as John so eloquently puts
[time=2963] it in 1 John chapter 3. We've been made children of glory. We're going to be in place of brilliance and glory and peace forever. Jesus said one thing about Judas though that
[time=2976] seems startling when first you read it. He said good for that man by whom the Son of
[time=2982] man is betrayed if he'd never been born. Let's put it simply. Jesus said it would have been a good thing if Judas had never seen the light of day. Did Jesus said that? Yes. Suppose
[time=2995] now however you went to the mother of Judas when she's still holding that little baby in her arms and you say you know it's too bad your baby was ever born. I'm quite sure
[time=3006] she'd be indignant. She said oh don't say that. After all she said this little baby holds all of our dreams and aspirations our hearts and lives are bound up in this little bundle of life and we've named him Judas and the word means praise, honor. And I'm sure
[time=3023] she's saying this child we've named Judas because we want him to be a praise to God in honor to his parrots. But you wait a while and Judas is growing up in Judea that's the
[time=3036] southern part of Palestine the educational center and the religious center of the land in that day. You go one of his playmates and you say you know been a good thing if your friend Judas had never been born. I think you might have gotten this kind of response.
[time=3050] Oh you shouldn't say that after all he has potential he's intelligent he's a good boy
[time=3057] and we voted him the most likely to succeed. Well you wait a while and he joins the apostolic
[time=3063] band. Now surely he's with the best company in the world and you don't have to worry about Judas any longer. He'll do all right won't he? And so you go up to the apostolic band and you say you know been a good thing if your companion Judas had never been born.
[time=3079] And Peter would have answered because he always did and he would have said oh don't say that.
[time=3085] After all we all believe in Judas. After all we made him the treasurer of the apostolic
[time=3091] band you do not make the man treasurer that you don't trust. They believed in Judas but
[time=3101] Judas was always the pretender always the hypocrite. The Bible tells us that no man calls Jesus Lord but by the Holy Spirit. If you acknowledge Christ as the Lord of your
[time=3112] life God has been working in your life and the essence of salvation is that you trust
[time=3119] Jesus enough to move under his management you make him the Lord of your life whose whoever
[time=3127] she'll call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. With a heart man believeth under
[time=3133] righteousness with confession the mouth makes confession unto salvation but Roman says you
[time=3139] confess Jesus as Lord. A woman taken in adultery was asked of Jesus does no man condemn thee
[time=3147] and she said no man Lord and surrendered to his control and he said neither do I condemn thee.
[time=3154] Judas never acknowledged the management of Jesus the right of Jesus to control him
[time=3162] he never called him Lord anyplace in the gospels always the pretender never suspected by the
[time=3170] disciples in fact when Jesus said it the last supper one of you shall betray me
[time=3176] none of the apostles said uh-huh I know who it is I suspected him all is Judas. Judas is the one
[time=3183] instead of that each apostle responded by saying Lord is it I in plain language Lord could I do it
[time=3192] I wouldn't want to do it I don't think I would do it but I know my own depravity my own perversity Lord maybe Lord could I do it nobody said I think Judas is the one
[time=3204] and when Judas went out into the night to perform his dastardly deed of betrayal
[time=3210] the bible writer says that the rest of the apostles thought he was going out either to buy
[time=3216] some food for the Passover or to give some money to the poor you know why because that was typical
[time=3224] of Judas it was just like Judas to go ahead buy the food get everything prepared have the meal ready when they came it was all done good Judas or he gave to the poor after all he had the bag he
[time=3239] was the treasure he was the one who ordinarily went out and distributed money to those who were in need what the apostles never had known was he'd been taking his own little commission out of it
[time=3250] right along they didn't know that he was a thief they didn't know that he had fooled them all
[time=3259] every time I read about Judas I think of him as as being known as good Judas I think of Shakespeare's great play Othello certainly one of the most moving and dramatic
[time=3270] tragedy is at Shakespeare ever wrote you remember that the villain in the play is Iago
[time=3276] Iago hates Othello and so he plots to deceive him he convinces him that his wife Desdemona has
[time=3287] been guilty of infidelity and finally as the minister of justice Othello kills Desdemona
[time=3296] only to learn later that he's been manipulated by Iago but it's quite interesting that all through
[time=3303] the play Shakespeare has a little adjective in front of Iago's name it's just like a constant
[time=3310] refrain in the play honest Iago honest Iago honest Iago good Judas good Judas good Judas
[time=3322] a pretender he was the hypocrite all the way
[time=3328] Judas certainly one of the most tragic characters we've ever encountered
[time=3339] and as we look at his life we have to go back to his parents and now say you know it had been a good thing if your son had never been born and his mother would agree now
[time=3351] yes it was too bad I ever gave him birth that he ever saw the light of the sun or smelled the
[time=3358] fragrance of flowers felt the warm sun on his cheek or the embrace of a friend that ever came
[time=3367] into God's world and to go out so tragically into an everlasting tradition you go back to his friends and classmates in Judea and they would agree and you go back to Peter
[time=3377] now and Peter would say yes by transgression Judas fell that he might go to his own place
[time=3385] the place he carved out for himself eternity you know if I came to you and told you that it
[time=3392] had been a good thing if you'd never been born I'd rather imagine you'd be indignant you certainly would not be happy with my statement can I say with all compassion that if you've come into God's world and will not acknowledge
[time=3407] the God who brought you into it if you have come born once experienced all the blessings
[time=3415] of God's common grace and yet spurn Jesus Christ who loved you died on Calvary's cross for you
[time=3422] suffer damnation for your redemption if you will not have him it would have been far better
[time=3428] that you'd never seen the light of day known the love of friends or the joys of this life
[time=3434] to find it apart this life and know the darkness of a Christless eternity forever
[time=3442] are two verses of scripture that always think up together one of his verse that has God speaking
[time=3449] which he says I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked God says when a man who is wicked
[time=3456] and all have sinned and come short of God's moral glory everybody without Jesus Christ is
[time=3463] sinful and unforgiven any who will not have him certainly is lost
[time=3470] God says no pleasure no pleasure but for the saved he says precious precious in the sight of the Lord
[time=3479] is the death of his saints when a saint when a child of God dies is not only precious to the
[time=3488] saint to go home to glory it is precious to God shall we bow in prayer and if you're without Jesus
[time=3497] Christ now is the time to come today is the day to do something about it tomorrow may well be too
