[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=63] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the word of God.
[time=70] They're preaching centers on God and the Lord of God.
[time=88] They're preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=99] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=104] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=116] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour Musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=125] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=135] - Good introduction.
[time=136] Welcome this morning.
[time=137] We're delighted that you're here with us.
[time=139] I want to say a special good morning and welcome to those who are joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=145] We have some special music coming up.
[time=147] Mr. David Miller will be singing along with Strictly Feminine and our children have lined the auditorium who will be singing later for us today.
[time=155] But we begin our worship this morning with a great anthem of praise.
[time=159] Glory to God in the highest.
[time=161] Our choir sings under the direction of Mr. Don Prueger.
[time=167] And some play that was with the angel of multitudes of the heaven leaders.
[time=173] Praise in God in saying...
[time=175] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=283] - That will always stir our hearts when we think of the
[time=292] greatness of our God.
[time=293] And I hope that today you are singing within your own hearts Glory to God in the highest.
[time=299] We have our children's choir coming to sing for us this morning.
[time=303] This is the Sunshine Choir.
[time=305] Last week we had another choir of children.
[time=308] Today these are our first, second, and third graders who are coming to sing for us.
[time=313] The Bible says train up a child in the way he should go.
[time=317] And when he is old, he will not depart from it.
[time=320] Music is a wonderful way to train children in the Word of God.
[time=324] Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Wendell have labored with them, teaching them Christian music.
[time=329] Much of what they sing comes straight out of the Psalms, the scriptures, the Word of God.
[time=333] They're here to sing for us today.
[time=335] The chair choir, or the Sunshine Choir, excuse me, under the direction of Mrs. Clark.
[time=341] [MUSIC]
[time=344] Some one hundred make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
[time=349] All ye lands serve the Lord with gladness.
[time=354] Come before his presence who is singing.
[time=357] Know ye that the Lord he is God.
[time=362] It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves.
[time=367] We are his people, and the sheep of his pastor.
[time=371] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise.
[time=378] We thank the one to him, and bless his name.
[time=383] For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting, and his truth is led to all generations, some one hundred.
[time=396] [MUSIC]
[time=404] Make a trip, but listen to the Lord.
[time=409] All ye lands, come before his presence who is singing.
[time=418] He is God, he is God.
[time=426] To make a trip, but listen to the Lord.
[time=431] All ye lands, come before his presence who is singing.
[time=440] He is God, he is God.
[time=448] For the Lord is good, his mercy is everlasting,
[time=465] is true in difference to all generations.
[time=476] We are his people, his sheep that hath made us.
[time=488] [MUSIC]
[time=496] Make a trip, but listen to the Lord.
[time=500] All ye lands, come before his presence who's singing.
[time=509] He is God, he is God.
[time=525] [MUSIC]
[time=534] Hello, I trust that you're having a good day today, and I hope that the spirit of Christmas is already beginning to fill your heart.
[time=542] With me is my good friend Don Kruger, who I'd like to brag on just a little bit this morning.
[time=547] Many of you know that every year we have a living Christmas tree performance of a concert here.
[time=553] Actually, we'll be doing that how many times this year?
[time=555] 15 times, Rick.
[time=556] 15 times.
[time=558] We'll fill this auditorium with people coming to hear in music the joy and the happiness of Christmas.
[time=565] And the reason why I'm bragging about Don this morning is he has written a cantata entitled God wrote the song, and that will be sung here 15 times.
[time=574] And some of the music that you'll hear later today by one of our group, Strictly Feminine, is one of Don's own arrangements.
[time=581] He wrote not only the music, but the lyrics also.
[time=583] Isn't that correct?
[time=584] That's correct.
[time=585] Well, we're certainly proud of Don and thankful for his talent that's dedicated to the Lord.
[time=591] Next week, we have a special guest coming to join us here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and he'll be speaking to you on the Bible Hour.
[time=598] His name is Dr. Robert Gromacki, and I understand that you and he are friends.
[time=603] Yes, Pastor Rick Bob Gromacki and I shared a platform at a Bible conference.
[time=608] I drew and sang, and he was the Bible teacher a few years ago, and he and his wife Gloria have been very good friends of Janet and mine for the last few years.
[time=617] Well, we're looking forward to him coming next week.
[time=619] He is a teaching professor at Cedarville College.
[time=623] Many of the students from our church attend Cedarville College, and we've had many, many people who have graduated from Cedarville College, who have been here to speak, or who are presently on the faculty there.
[time=635] You may remember Dr. Paul Dixon, who was here just a few weeks ago.
[time=638] He's the president of that same school, a great number of godly men serving Christ in Christian education, and we're looking forward to Dr. Gromacki being with us next week.
[time=649] You may recall that over the last weeks, we've been talking to you about the Bible Hour Prayer Counseling Line.
[time=657] We shared with you that we needed to take care of our existing finances before we could go ahead with that new project.
[time=664] At this point, we do not have the freedom to take on a new assignment in this area of the prayer counseling line until our finances are completely caught up, and we're being responsible for our past financial needs.
[time=679] I trust that you'll be prayerfully considering helping us.
[time=683] Many of you may have received a letter about that, and I hope that you haven't just laid that aside and forgotten about it, but that you'll write in today in response to the opportunity to provide for the Bible Hour Prayer Counseling Line.
[time=696] Along the same discussion of counseling, we've shared with you for several weeks about a little booklet entitled Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=704] This will be the last week that we'll offer this little booklet to you.
[time=708] We'll be offering some other helpful Christian literature, but literally, hundreds of people have written in for this little booklet, and we'd like to share it with you.
[time=716] I know it'll be encouragement to your life.
[time=718] We had one lady write in and just tell us how that book was such an encouragement to her.
[time=723] This lady writes past to Rick, please send me your book by Dr. Ken Nichols, Remedies for Negative Thinking.
[time=729] This is something that I have been struggling with and am in great need of.
[time=734] Usually, I have to miss the program, the Bible Hour, but today, I was able to catch it.
[time=738] I started weeping, and I knew that God had arranged it so that I could see your program and hear of this booklet.
[time=746] I am seeing a Christian's counselor at the present time and certainly need help.
[time=751] This tremendous little book, Remedies for Negative Thinking, has been something that we've been giving in the last few weeks, as Pastor Rick said, and we have gotten a tremendous response more than we had ever thought or hoped.
[time=762] It's a tremendous little book, and it has the idea of thoughts that are constantly on the downward trend, negative thoughts.
[time=771] And when we have these thoughts, we become very depressed.
[time=774] And sometimes, we can have this kind of pattern in our lives and not even realize it, but this book is a help for things like that.
[time=781] So if you're like this lady, and you need some help in the line of negative thinking, please write to us the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=795] That's the Bible Hour Box 15,015,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=804] And we'd be glad to send you this little book.
[time=807] It'll be a great help to you, as I'm sure it's been to many others, too.
[time=811] You know, Don, there's not a one of us today that really couldn't use this little booklet.
[time=815] Every one of us struggles with anger, our resentment, our frustration, negative emotions.
[time=821] Some of them are listed as the fruits of the flesh, contrary to the fruits of the spirit.
[time=826] And this little booklet will help every one of us live victorially in Christ Jesus.
[time=831] I hope that you'll write today.
[time=832] Ask for this little booklet.
[time=834] Thank you for joining us, and now we're going to return to the worship service and be encouraged through the ministry of music, as strictly feminine sings for us one of the songs written by our own minister of music, Don Kruger.
[time=847] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=849] Won't you write in?
[time=850] Send to us for this little booklet.
[time=852] Perhaps even help us with the financial needs.
[time=855] God bless you.
[time=867] And there were, in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=874] [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=1035] (dramatic music) - Thank you ladies, that was a beautiful reminder that Jesus Christ was born.
[time=1044] He came into the world as a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.
[time=1048] There's life ended on a cross.
[time=1049] When he died for you, he died for me.
[time=1053] Now that he's arisen, he lives that he might live within our hearts and that we might serve him.
[time=1058] Serve him as instruments in his hands, bringing the gospel of good tidings and peace to all men.
[time=1065] David Miller comes to sing for us a song that captures that message.
[time=1069] Most of the words written centuries ago by St. Francis of Assisi, put a modern tomb that will speak your heart.
[time=1076] Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
[time=1079] Mr. David Miller.
[time=1080] (upbeat music)
[time=1095] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=1296] (gentle music) - Amen. Thank you, David, for leading in that song which should be the prayer of our hearts, that God would use us and that He would make us instruments within His hands, bringing peace to this city, to this country, and to a world in crisis.
[time=1315] Let us bow and pray together to that end.
[time=1318] Our Father, it's the desire of my heart that in these next moments, that I would be an instrument in your hand, that I might be no more selfish than an impersonal scalpel in the hand of a doctor, that you might use my life and use your word and your spirit to speak to hearts today.
[time=1337] And God made each one of us leave this auditorium after hearing your word with our lives encouraged and challenged to be instruments in the hand of God in whose name we pray, amen.
[time=1351] Writing about life in the United States during the roaring '20s, Sinclair Lewis wrote a work entitled "Elmer Gantry." Many of you probably read that as high score college students as required reading in an American literature course.
[time=1367] Perhaps you saw the televised movie "Elmer Gantry" as it was portrayed by Bert Lancaster.
[time=1373] One way or the other, most of us have heard of Elmer Gantry.
[time=1378] Elmer Gantry is the story of an American, a vangelical preacher revivalist of the roaring '20s.
[time=1386] Sinclair Lewis writes, not just a story, but an indictment against Christianity.
[time=1393] You see, Elmer Gantry has all the charisma that if he was here today, no doubt, he would be able to draw a great crowd.
[time=1401] He had the persuasive ability to capture the attention of a great audience.
[time=1407] He had the stature and the ability just to make people want to be around him.
[time=1413] An oh impressive and eloquent was his style of preaching.
[time=1418] Elmer Gantry, but it's more than a story.
[time=1423] It's an indictment.
[time=1424] For Elmer Gantry was a charlatan.
[time=1427] Elmer Gantry was the classical example of a hypocrite, one who preached one message and who walked a completely different one.
[time=1437] Elmer Gantry.
[time=1441] The tragedy of that story is not that it was written
[time=1447] and it stands as a criticism of born-again, fundamental Christianity.
[time=1452] The tragedy is that in many ways, it's a true story.
[time=1457] Many ways Elmer Gantry lives today,
[time=1463] here, in your life and in mine.
[time=1467] For see, Elmer Gantry is simply a make-believe character designed to represent people who talk, but they don't match their talk with their walk.
[time=1480] Conduct.
[time=1482] The Apostle Paul was greatly concerned about conduct in the life of believers.
[time=1488] I invite you to turn with me to Philippians, the first chapter and verse 27.
[time=1493] Earlier in first Philippians, Paul has talked about his own situation.
[time=1498] He's in prison, in Rome.
[time=1500] He's being held by the Praetorian guard of Caesar's household.
[time=1505] He's being held as a prisoner for the gospel of Christ.
[time=1508] He writes a great letter of personal victory.
[time=1511] He says, "For me to live is Christ, and to die is game." But then in verse 27, he turns the attention away from himself onto the people of the church of Philippi.
[time=1524] First chapter of Philippians, verse 27.
[time=1528] Let your conduct be as it become with the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else am absent, I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit and with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=1548] And in nothing, terrified by your adversaries, witches to them, an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God.
[time=1561] For it is given unto you in behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.
[time=1570] Having the same conflict that you saw in me and now here to be in me, conduct.
[time=1578] Is it really important?
[time=1580] I mean, is conduct of a Christian all that important?
[time=1583] Oh, I know that Sinclair Lewis can write a critical review, but is it really that important that God would write about your conduct in mine?
[time=1592] I believe it is.
[time=1594] The sentence begins, only let your conduct be as become with the gospel.
[time=1601] Many of you are studying from a King James Bible.
[time=1603] That's what I have here this morning, but mine is a slightly revised one.
[time=1607] It changes that little word conversation to the word conduct.
[time=1611] In 1611, when the translation of the King James Bible was done, conversation meant something greatly different than it means today.
[time=1619] Today, if we refer to our conversation, we might refer to a phone call that you and I had in recent days.
[time=1626] We might talk about an encounter where we bumped into each other at a shopping center and exchanged a few words.
[time=1632] But conversation really does not need to be limited just to our verbal usage of words.
[time=1639] It refers to the conduct of our life.
[time=1643] But even if we trace back a little further, I believe we get an insight into this word, which gives us an understanding of what the great apostle was writing about as God so inspired him.
[time=1655] For you see that little word that we're talking about, whether you translate a conduct or conversation comes from a compound form of a Greek word simply stated as polis, polis.
[time=1667] You use that word a lot.
[time=1668] You say, "Oh, I don't, sure you do." Little word means city.
[time=1672] Have you ever heard of Indian app polis?
[time=1675] Polis, city of Indiana.
[time=1677] Minneapolis, polis, meaning city.
[time=1681] Annapolis, city, polis.
[time=1685] But it also has a broader term.
[time=1687] You may be familiar with the word politics or political.
[time=1691] It comes from that same word.
[time=1693] Actually, the meaning of that word is to be a citizen.
[time=1698] Now that has an important understanding that we understand context.
[time=1702] Paul was a Roman citizen.
[time=1705] Years before he came to the city of Philippi and there he was arrested.
[time=1710] He was put in chains.
[time=1711] He was beaten with stripes.
[time=1713] He was locked into prison and held.
[time=1716] But he was a Roman citizen.
[time=1720] During the night they discovered that he was a Roman citizen and they came the next morning quickly trying to release him because it was illegal to so treat a Roman citizen.
[time=1730] Citizenship was important.
[time=1733] Now Paul was being held prisoner in Rome, the capital of the empire.
[time=1739] And he writes to Philippi.
[time=1741] Philippi is not a conquered city.
[time=1743] It is not a city like Athens where military might took it over.
[time=1747] It was not a city like Jerusalem where there were station Romans keeping the law.
[time=1751] Philippi itself was a Roman colony.
[time=1754] The people to whom Paul wrote were citizens of Rome and they understood with that citizenship not only came opportunity, there came responsibility.
[time=1766] So Paul writes with a background, people understanding words and understanding their own situation.
[time=1772] He now writes about citizenship.
[time=1775] That idea is developed elsewhere by Paul.
[time=1777] He tells us in Ephesians 2,8, 19 that we are a part of the citizenship of the household of God.
[time=1787] Flip back one or two pages in your Bible to Philippians chapter three and verse 20.
[time=1794] Paul writes about citizenship.
[time=1796] Same word he says for our citizenship, our conversation is in heaven.
[time=1804] From whom also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1809] Do you understand what he was saying?
[time=1812] He was writing to a group of people who were proud Romans.
[time=1816] They were the conquerors of the world and a man could bear no greater title than to say that I am a Roman citizen.
[time=1826] It was something that would be said with great pride.
[time=1829] There would be a special privilege that would be afforded to Roman citizens.
[time=1834] Those privileges of opportunity, they could never be enslaved.
[time=1838] Never.
[time=1839] They had the privilege that they could never be imprisoned and held without a trial.
[time=1845] They had the privilege that never could be laid to their back.
[time=1850] They were privileged people.
[time=1852] But they also knew responsibility.
[time=1855] For you see, these men, many of them, came to be colonized in this city as a land bounty.
[time=1861] They were given land as a reward for their service in the military.
[time=1866] Many of them fought at the Battle of Actium 30 BC when the forces of Octavian met the forces of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra and won the monumental battles of history.
[time=1879] Octavian won and became the first to repeat the name Caesar who comes to us in history as Caesar Augustus.
[time=1886] And these men knew the responsibility that had gotten them the citizenship of Philippi.
[time=1893] Now he writes to them and says, in effect, you're not citizens of Philippi.
[time=1898] You're not citizens of Rome.
[time=1900] Your citizenship has been withdrawn and moved to heaven.
[time=1904] Therefore, it affects our conduct.
[time=1907] We no longer live as Romans.
[time=1910] We live as Christians.
[time=1912] It demands a change in our conduct.
[time=1915] So in the first chapter when he says, let your conduct, your citizenship, be worthy of the gospel.
[time=1924] Worthy of the gospel.
[time=1927] No, Paul was saying he was to say that there was to be a behavior that distinguished them as part of a particular nationality.
[time=1937] Although it wasn't a nation of men, it was a heavenly nation.
[time=1941] That there was something about their behavior that was to reflect that they were believers in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1948] There was responsibility.
[time=1950] Notice the word worthy.
[time=1952] It occurs countless times in Scripture.
[time=1954] Let me read a few of those for you.
[time=1957] Ephesians 4-1, walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.
[time=1963] Paul was writing to the church of Ephesus and said, as Christians, you walk worthy of that calling.
[time=1968] And as you walk in obedience to Christ, the Bible says, God even makes a man's enemies to be at peace with him.
[time=1975] We walk worthy.
[time=1977] First Thessalonians, chapter 2, verse 12, walk worthy of the God who have called you into his kingdom and into his glory.
[time=1986] We are a chosen, called people.
[time=1988] And with that choice and with that calling comes, responsibility, responsibility.
[time=1995] Because you see in antiquity, a name meant something.
[time=2000] A name meant something.
[time=2002] Perhaps you enjoy watching some of the reruns of the old movies of the days when chivalry and knighthood were alive.
[time=2010] And men literally fought and died simply to defend honor in their name.
[time=2016] Because a name meant something.
[time=2019] Today, one of the most meaningless names that could be given is the name Christian.
[time=2025] Why is that?
[time=2026] Why is it that the name of Jesus Christ is a name that is above every name?
[time=2031] And yet it's one of the most meaningless terms.
[time=2035] Today, Christian describes anyone who lives in this country, who is neither a Jew, nor a Muslim, or an atheist.
[time=2043] Everyone is a Christian.
[time=2045] It came through the ranks of the Danish kings that once they had been conquered by the Germans and forced into Christians, they began to name their kings, Christian.
[time=2057] So if you would read about the history of Denmark, you'd read of Christian the first and Christian the second and Christian the third, many of them who never believed in Christ.
[time=2067] But they took a name.
[time=2070] The Bible says that that which we are called is worthy.
[time=2073] We're to be worthy of a kingdom.
[time=2075] That demands that there be an obedience between our walk and our talk.
[time=2079] John wrote in 1 John chapter 2, verse 6.
[time=2082] And if you like pronouns, you'll love this verse.
[time=2085] John wrote and said, "He that says that he is in him ought to walk is himself also walked." Let me put some nouns in there.
[time=2094] The one who says, "I am in Christ." That individual ought to walk even as Jesus Christ walked.
[time=2100] You know, men and women, the Bible demands as Christians that we'll be obedient to the Word of God.
[time=2107] And if there's a fear that I have in this era of Christianity, it's that we become far too eclectic, far too indiscriminately blending together of ideas.
[time=2117] It's not uncommon to hear a humanistic philosophy on this hand, a situational ethics philosophy over here.
[time=2124] Over here, a behavioral model that allows for development based upon environment, depleting human responsibility.
[time=2132] And an individual brings all these together and says, "I am a Christian." And then as they speak, they begin to speak, representing not the Word of God, but their own philosophy.
[time=2143] And then we dangerously do it in our own lives.
[time=2147] This morning, there are those today that name the name of Christ, but their walk is one of their own philosophy.
[time=2155] Joseph Fletcher wrote a book entitled "Situational Ethics." The basic philosophy is that there are no fixed absolutes, but that every situation has its own right and wrong.
[time=2171] I'm amazed at the number of Christian people who I meet in their home.
[time=2175] They come to the office.
[time=2176] They want counsel.
[time=2177] And yet their philosophy is not built upon the Word of God, is based upon their situation.
[time=2183] They say, "I know what the Bible says, but you don't understand my situation.
[time=2189] Men and women, I have to respond.
[time=2191] I know your situation.
[time=2193] You don't know the Word of God.
[time=2195] It demands a walk." Joseph Fletcher began that book with a story.
[time=2200] A man comes up to a young lady.
[time=2202] The man is known as a fluent and wealthy.
[time=2205] One of the known millionaires in the community.
[time=2208] He says to the young lady, "Would you sleep with me tonight if I was to give you a million dollars?" She said, "Yes, I would." He said, "Then would you for $500,000?" Yes, I would.
[time=2220] Would you for $100,000, I suppose so?
[time=2224] Would you for $10,000?
[time=2227] Yes?
[time=2229] Would you for $1,000?
[time=2232] The lady responded in anger, "Just a minute.
[time=2234] What do you think I am?" He said, "Young lady, that's already been established.
[time=2239] We're just haggling about the price." He said, "Oh, that's a crude story." You know that it's the exact philosophy that many live with today in this church?
[time=2250] Know that the morality that they place upon their own life is completely situational?
[time=2255] Well, they may not surrender purity based upon money, but they would on another situation.
[time=2261] Loneliness, companionship, hurt, so I'm striking back to hurt.
[time=2266] Do you know that there are many situationalists today that would never prostitute their body for money, but they would for their own selfish reason, and their responses, "Oh, oh no, I'm a Christian.
[time=2281] You just don't understand my situation." God understands your situation.
[time=2287] He knows the hurts.
[time=2288] He knows the brokenness of life.
[time=2290] He knows the pressure and the frustration, but he writes with the force of an absolute.
[time=2298] And Jesus said this, "If you love me, keep my commandments.
[time=2304] If you love me, keep my commandments." And there are those that come with a liberal theology that says, "God is love, and therefore anything that I do is in love is of God, and therefore whether we're married or we're not married, if we love each other, it's of God." And then they can apply all the Christian compounds.
[time=2325] We've prayed about it.
[time=2327] God opened the door.
[time=2329] The situation was miraculously provided by God.
[time=2333] Men and women, God is not a situationalist today.
[time=2337] He demands obedience in our conduct.
[time=2340] And he said, "Let your conduct be.
[time=2343] Come the gospel of Christ. Let it be worthy.
[time=2347] Let our lives represent Him as citizenship.
[time=2349] We have responsibility.
[time=2351] Not only as citizens, but more than that, we are ambassadors.
[time=2356] We are chosen, selected representatives.
[time=2359] If Christ is to be seen at all, He is to be seen in you and I.
[time=2365] Elmer Gantry, the story of a man who talked one message
[time=2371] and walked a completely different one.
[time=2374] Say, "Oh, is it really important?" Yes, it is.
[time=2378] It's really important.
[time=2380] It's so important that God said that our sins cost Him the life of His own dear Son, that therefore we have been bought with the price, and we are not our own.
[time=2391] Therefore we are to glorify God in our bodies, and it is to be reflected in the conduct of our lives.
[time=2400] Then He says, "Let your conduct be as become with the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs." No, He was saying.
[time=2411] He had written to them earlier in the same chapter, saying, "I'm hoping to be released from prison and to come see you." But if I don't make it, you walk just the same.
[time=2421] You walk just the same.
[time=2424] What He was saying is He understood human behavior.
[time=2427] And some of us have one behavior when someone is watching and a completely different one when someone else is not watching.
[time=2434] I understand that principle.
[time=2436] A few weeks ago, I was going to repair the muffler on my own car.
[time=2439] I was confident that I could put that new muffler on, where I ran into trouble, was trying to get the old muffler off.
[time=2447] And I called up the particular company where I bought the new muffler.
[time=2450] I said, "I can't get this off.
[time=2451] If I bring the muffler back and my car back, can you put it on?" Sure.
[time=2454] If I'm there in one hour, can you take care of me right away?
[time=2458] Yeah, no problem.
[time=2459] I got there just as I said.
[time=2461] In about one hour, that was noon.
[time=2464] Thought I'd be out right away.
[time=2466] He said, "Well, that'll be about five, maybe six o'clock before we'll be able to even get to it." And I had a wedding at three o'clock.
[time=2475] I could just feel the heat starting down around my leg.
[time=2477] You know, it was coming.
[time=2478] I really-- boy, I was going to give it to him.
[time=2481] I was going to tell him that I was the guy that called an hour ago, and he told me he could do it.
[time=2486] And what kind of business was this anyway?
[time=2488] And before I open my mouth, I said, I wonder if this guy watches the Bible hour.
[time=2492] So I said, "I understand.
[time=2498] We all get busy.
[time=2500] I'll call my wife.
[time=2500] She'll come pick me up and you can have the car." A sudden change of behavior.
[time=2505] Why?
[time=2507] Because I was afraid somebody'd look, say, short guy, curly hair, blue eyes.
[time=2512] I've seen that guy somewhere before.
[time=2515] And I was certain that as soon as I gave him a piece of my mind, and I couldn't afford to lose any either.
[time=2522] But as soon as I told him how I felt about the situation, he'd say, "Ah, aren't you from Black Hawk Baptist Church?"
[time=2531] And when that thought came into my mind, demanded a change in behavior.
[time=2537] Can you be trusted when no one's looking?
[time=2540] As a student, when a teacher gives an examination, and then in the middle of that examination, the teacher walks out of the room for just a few minutes, can you be trusted when no one's watching?
[time=2554] Remember, as a college student, going into the classrooms bigger than this auditorium, there would literally be dozens of televisions hanging from the ceiling.
[time=2561] And as you came into the room a little time ago, man, it was 2 o'clock, and the TVs would automatically come on, and there was your education.
[time=2569] Now, tests came every other Friday.
[time=2572] The tests were also on the television.
[time=2574] 800 people in one room, one graduate student sitting at a desk moderating 800 students.
[time=2582] Question comes up.
[time=2583] The second president of the United States was George Washington, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, none of the above.
[time=2590] And you're sitting there thinking some kid over in the other room yells, "Oh, I know that one.
[time=2594] It's John Adams." Would you write down John Adams even if you thought it was George Washington?
[time=2599] Can you be trusted when no one's there to watch?
[time=2603] By the time that monitor got over there to find out who yelled that answer out, the next question was up, and a kid over here was yelling out the answer.
[time=2610] And the whole test was given, and the answers were shouted at every question.
[time=2615] Would you put down what they said?
[time=2618] Or would you put down what you thought, even though you knew they were right?
[time=2624] Could you be trusted when no one was watching?
[time=2627] Can you be trusted in business?
[time=2631] I mean, if the way you conduct your business was as public as this message is today, could you be trusted?
[time=2638] Would there be some areas that you wish weren't part of that discussion?
[time=2642] If people probed into your personal life with the same intensity that they probed into the life of Richard Nixon, could you be trusted?
[time=2653] Or do you just trustworthy when people can see when people watch?
[time=2660] Also, Paul said, only you let your conduct be as become with the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else I be absent, I will hear of your affairs.
[time=2671] I remember being a student at a Christian college.
[time=2675] It was in a small town, as you went into that town, there was one little place, little dinner counter that was open late at night.
[time=2683] My friend and I used to go in there a couple times a week, 50 cents for Hamburgs, that tells you how long ago it was, 50 cents for Hamburg, and we had to study talk to the people that worked there.
[time=2694] We were known as college students at a Christian college.
[time=2697] They liked to tease us a little bit, ask us how our prayer life was doing, just general little teasing.
[time=2704] Then one day we're sitting at that counter, about five o'clock, a bunch of the locals came running in and boy did they have a story to tell.
[time=2711] Just a few minutes before a young man got caught shoplifting in one of the department stores, and wouldn't you know.
[time=2720] They said guess what school he goes to.
[time=2723] I said I don't know what schools he goes to.
[time=2726] He goes to your school, your Christian school.
[time=2730] And then they laughed, they begin to describe how he took things and stuffed them into his pants and they laughed and they laughed and they said yeah, tell us all about Christianity, tell us all about it.
[time=2743] Does conduct make a difference?
[time=2745] Yeah, it really does.
[time=2749] We're to walk worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ, whether anyone's looking or whether no one's looking at all.
[time=2758] Perhaps Elma Gantry's here today.
[time=2761] Perhaps there's a little bit of him in me and also in you.
[time=2766] The Bible challenges us to represent Christ as citizens and as ambassadors for Jesus Christ.
[time=2774] How then should our affairs be conducted?
[time=2777] It says whether I'm absent or present, I hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=2789] Paul said I want to hear that you're standing for Christ, that you're not being moved about by the situation, that you're not being challenged by someone godly individual to change your conduct, but that you're standing.
[time=2804] And that word stand means to take a military position, one braced for the battle.
[time=2809] Are you standing today?
[time=2813] Are you like the man that James wrote about?
[time=2816] When he said the double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways, he's like the wave of the sea, lifted and dumped and tossed and thrown by the wind, whether so ever the wind wants.
[time=2829] You like the wave of the sea or today or are you standing for Christ?
[time=2832] You've counted the cost and you're standing for him.
[time=2836] Over 12 years ago, I received Christ a Savior.
[time=2840] The night I walked forward in a large auditorium, they sang this song.
[time=2845] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=2852] Though no one joined me, still I will follow.
[time=2860] Could you stand today if you were to stand alone?
[time=2863] Would you stand for Christ in a job where there's ridicule
[time=2870] and they love to point out all of the omergantries of this day?
[time=2875] Would you stand?
[time=2876] Would you be embarrassed?
[time=2878] There was not another person in your office complex.
[time=2882] Could you sing though no one joined me?
[time=2885] Still I will follow.
[time=2887] Would you stand for him?
[time=2889] Then the apostle describes that as conduct as how we ought to stand.
[time=2894] He says this, that you stand fast in one spirit and in one mind.
[time=2899] He speaks of standing united, standing together with singleness of mind, with singleness of purpose.
[time=2906] I'm so thankful that God gave us the book of Philippians to study in these days and that He saw range the balance of speakers that came in and the opportunities that I had to share with you that today we come to this passage because I really believe there's a threat to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2924] You say, oh no, we're gonna hear about money again.
[time=2926] No, I'm not gonna talk about money because the great threat that is ominous in the future, the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the greatest one has absolutely no financial value to it.
[time=2938] It's not the absence of a senior pastor.
[time=2941] The greatest threat to this body of people that we'd lose unity, that we'd lose oneness of spirit and oneness of mind.
[time=2949] Do you know where unity has been broken in history?
[time=2954] Unity has been broken in history by selfishness.
[time=2959] When an individual looks at a complex situation and they look at that situation and the only eyes through which they can see are their own eyes.
[time=2967] And there are those today that may be in danger of breaking the unity of these people, this body, because they look only through their own eyes.
[time=2978] Far too often, people have said, well, I don't really think our church needs and they begin to name a ministry.
[time=2987] It's always a ministry that doesn't touch their life.
[time=2991] I don't understand why we need two counselors on our staff, probably 'cause they've never wanted someone to talk to them that could help them.
[time=3001] Well, I think that my kids made it fine through the public schools and I don't see the need for a Christian education.
[time=3008] See through their own eyes, therefore, because they don't need it, nobody needs it.
[time=3014] Well, I really don't understand why this church stands behind television.
[time=3018] Could be because they've never known someone who came to Christ through this ministry.
[time=3023] Could be because they've not had a loved one that was racked with pain and couldn't go to church.
[time=3028] The Word of God came into their homes and gave them confidence in their heart.
[time=3032] Could be because no one in their family is an unbeliever and won't come to church, but we'll watch it on television.
[time=3040] Yet, within that, there are problems.
[time=3045] There are struggles, but yet there doesn't have to be the division, because you see, division is caused by selfishness when one person says, all I want is this, all I care that we ever have is a Sunday morning service, so I can preach.
[time=3058] So not selfish, yes it is.
[time=3061] You see, God's give-ness, every ministry that's here, that's the desire of my heart that that which God's give-ness will be able to maintain, but yet the demands that there be a unity of spirit.
[time=3072] There are those today that would divide this congregation because they don't like something.
[time=3077] You know, my friend, no matter what we did here, you'd find something that you don't like.
[time=3083] I listened to my own messages.
[time=3084] I haven't found one of those, I liked yet.
[time=3089] Did you come this morning because you like me?
[time=3091] I hope not.
[time=3093] Did you come this morning because you like the choir?
[time=3096] Sincerely, hope not.
[time=3098] Did you come here today because you love the Lord Jesus Christ and you've chosen this place to worship Him and to serve?
[time=3104] Oh, with the God that that was each of our heart today, that we've come to worship and to serve.
[time=3109] You know, one thing I've discovered is the people that serve the hardest, complain the least.
[time=3115] You know, if you've come today to serve, you're not going to have a problem with other ministries.
[time=3120] You're going to rejoice that even though something doesn't touch your life that it touches the lives of other people, that there be a unity of spirit and a unity of mind.
[time=3130] Paul says that we are to stand in the first description of how we stand is that we stand united.
[time=3136] There be no division within the body.
[time=3139] Oh, there can be disagreement.
[time=3141] There's far difference between disagreement and division.
[time=3145] How far greater difference that we stand united.
[time=3148] Secondly, that it says that we stand striving.
[time=3152] I don't like to use the Greek words simply to impress you.
[time=3155] I like to use them when they tell you something that you already know and you just didn't know it.
[time=3161] Let me tell you what you know about this little word striving.
[time=3165] It's a little word composed of two different words, soon ethlongtoes.
[time=3170] Now let's break, soon means with, together.
[time=3173] Now let me pronounce that word in English, athletics.
[time=3178] Athletics, you know that word.
[time=3180] You're going to go home and watch football today.
[time=3183] And that is an excellent illustration of this word.
[time=3187] It means to strive to work together like athletes on a team.
[time=3192] Some of you men have played some football and you remember being alignment and how you protect the passer.
[time=3199] The key thing in past blocking is that each man on that line has a coordinated team effort that is they step out and block and recoil back.
[time=3209] They set up a perimeter that cannot be penetrated or broken and they stand together.
[time=3215] They strive to keep the enemy out.
[time=3218] They don't want a scene to be broken through.
[time=3221] God said that we are to stand striving.
[time=3224] Do you know that it takes effort to maintain a church ministry?
[time=3228] That it takes effort to produce a living Christmas tree?
[time=3231] You may come to a living Christmas tree every year and you say, oh, that's just beautiful.
[time=3234] Boy, they must have worked all night putting that together.
[time=3237] Oh, now all night for about the last four months.
[time=3240] You know, it takes effort to maintain a church.
[time=3244] It takes effort to maintain a ministry.
[time=3247] It takes effort to maintain a godly home and a marriage that's meaningful.
[time=3252] You know that it takes effort to walk in Christ.
[time=3256] And the Bible says that we are to strive with the stretching straining of an athlete, of an athlete.
[time=3263] Paul must have went to the games often because the Bible's full of illustrations out of the realm of athletics.
[time=3271] Paul often saw the agony in the face of a wrestler as he was striving to defeat the individual.
[time=3279] I'm sure that he saw the pain in the marathon runner as he would make his way through that 26 plus out course.
[time=3286] Paul probably saw the callous feet, the emaciated body of individuals that fought in the pentathlon at the end of that battle.
[time=3296] He said, we are to strive for the gospel.
[time=3299] You know, men and women, you may say, but I thought God said it.
[time=3302] If you simply pray and ask believing, I'll give you what you want.
[time=3305] And I ask God to give us a million dollars to take care of television and sculpture.
[time=3310] That's true.
[time=3311] God says to pray and he'll answer.
[time=3313] But he also says that we're to strive.
[time=3316] We're to strive.
[time=3317] We're to pour our life into effort to serving him.
[time=3320] And this church needs the effort and the striving of every one of us.
[time=3325] And then if we are to lock arms and we're to brace each other, and as we strive, we can fulfill the next thing that he says.
[time=3333] And in nothing, terrified by your adversaries.
[time=3336] Are you afraid?
[time=3338] Are you frightened when you pick up that church bulletin and it tells you what the budget is and how much came in?
[time=3343] Do you shake and tremble?
[time=3344] Well, I do.
[time=3345] The Bible says we shouldn't, though.
[time=3348] It says that we should not be afraid of our enemies.
[time=3350] And if you want to know all God said about that, you'll have to come back tonight.
[time=3354] So we invite you to do that.
[time=3356] Paul said this.
[time=3357] First of all, he says, let your conduct be of becoming the gospel that you stand.
[time=3362] And here's how we're to stand in these ways.
[time=3364] First, he says that we're to stand fast with one mind.
[time=3368] Stand united.
[time=3369] Secondly, we're to stand striving.
[time=3371] That means the poor fourth effort.
[time=3374] Thirdly, he says that we are to stand unshaken or confidently.
[time=3378] Fourthly, he says we should be standing ready to suffer.
[time=3382] And then fifthly, he says that we are to stand with him.
[time=3386] We'll cover the rest of that tonight in detail.
[time=3389] But this morning, do you understand that Jesus Christ died for you?
[time=3393] And if you have, by faith, received him as Savior, you are now a citizen, not just of this country, but you're a citizen of the family and the kingdom of God and it demands obedience to your walk.
[time=3405] And while God understands your situation, he demands with absolute obedience in our life.
[time=3411] Perhaps this morning, you don't understand that because you've not yet come to Christ by faith.
[time=3417] Because you've not invited him by prayer in your life.
[time=3420] You've never opened your heart and parents that, Lord, Jesus Christ, come into my heart.
[time=3425] I want you to be my Savior.
[time=3428] Perhaps today, the words that have been spoken, are words that were addressed to someone else because you're not yet a citizen in the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[time=3438] May I today encourage you, may I invite you to pray a simple prayer that says this.
[time=3445] Lord Jesus, I want you to be my Savior.
[time=3448] I believe you died for my sins.
[time=3450] I want you to come into my heart and be my Savior.
[time=3454] You know, that prayer does absolutely nothing miraculous in the sense that it gives you a feeling or a sensation, but it does something miraculous in the records of heaven.
[time=3464] That you're transferred out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his glorious light.
[time=3468] And the Bible says, if we will, by faith, receive Jesus as Savior, that we will be born again.
[time=3474] That he will come into our heart and he will begin making us a new person.
[time=3478] It says, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.
[time=3481] All things pass away and all things become new and that citizenship of which we spoke this morning becomes a reality.
[time=3489] You today invite Jesus Christ into your heart as Savior.
[time=3494] I pray that you will.
[time=3495] A father this morning, it is our prayer.
