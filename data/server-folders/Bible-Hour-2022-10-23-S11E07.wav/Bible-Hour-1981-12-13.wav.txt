[time=60] (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=88] Each week Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=95] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=106] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=112] Included in today's service will be a family time Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=122] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour Musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=132] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=142] - Now at this time we want to welcome all of you who've joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=147] All of you can notice that this is not a typical Sunday morning here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=154] Behind me stands our Living Christmas Tree, alive with choir members waiting to sing to you the praises of God at this Christmas season.
[time=164] We're enjoying this Christmas with the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=167] We have 15 concerts this year with over 20,000 tickets out.
[time=172] We're expecting great crowds later today and throughout the week.
[time=176] There are no more tickets available, but we're looking forward to the opportunity to minister to those who will be coming during this holiday season.
[time=184] I hope this is a very Christ-filled Christmas for you.
[time=189] This year's Living Christmas Tree is doubly special for us because this year's music was written and arranged by our own minister of music, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=199] The cantata that he produced bears the title, God wrote the song.
[time=205] So at this time Don is coming to direct the choir in two numbers from that cantata.
[time=210] The first is shout forth in praise and the second is God wrote the song.

[time=551] - Hello and welcome to the Bible hour during this Christmas season.
[time=556] I hope that you're having a delightful holiday time and that your family is getting together these days for Christmas.
[time=563] My daughter is screaming in the background and in a moment we're gonna introduce you to all of our families.
[time=569] But you know best of all amongst the Bible, our families, Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=574] Don is our minister of music and this is a very special time for he and our whole church because we're in the middle of a beautiful Christmas pageant entitled The Living Christmas Tree.
[time=585] And what is so special about it this year, Don wrote the music.
[time=589] It's a cantata with the title God wrote the song.
[time=592] Don, how is the cantata going this year?
[time=595] - Well we've had five performances already past the rick and it's been going real well and you just can imagine for me what the thrill is to have my own choir doing my own music.
[time=605] It just is really exciting.
[time=606] - Well Don, it's not only thrilling for you but for all of us.
[time=610] We have over 20,000 tickets out of people coming during the 14 public performances of this cantata and it's a very, very special way to share the joy of Christmas.
[time=621] And we're thankful for you and for your daughter who's now screaming in the background.
[time=626] Christmas is for children and we've got children here today.
[time=630] Another member of our Bible, our family who you know is Dale Sigland.
[time=634] Dale is our producer and director and he's really the brains behind this operation in case you were trying to figure that out.
[time=641] Good morning Dale and welcome.
[time=642] - Good morning Rick.
[time=643] - Glad you've joined us here today.
[time=645] In just a few moments we're gonna introduce you to each of our families, to the Krueger's and the Siglands and the Hawks's but we wanted to take a few minutes to talk to you during this Christmas season.
[time=656] I hope that your families are getting together and this is a joyful time.
[time=660] It is here at our church.
[time=662] One of the things that we're working on besides the living Christmas tree is a special love offering.
[time=668] Starting this month we'll be asking our people to consider giving a special love gift to the Lord.
[time=674] It's the end of the year, it's Christmas time and both of those making an appropriate time to share some of the good things that God has given to us with one another and with the ministry that God has given to us.
[time=687] We'd like to ask you to join with the Black Hawk Baptist Church as the Bible our family and be a part of a special Christmas offering.
[time=696] In the next days many of you who've written into us will receive a letter from us explaining to you some of our financial needs as it relates to the Bible our.
[time=706] But could we ask you to consider during this Christmas season to send a gift to the Bible our?
[time=712] We'd so much appreciate that as we've shared with you often the cost of television is expensive and week by week we're not quite meeting the expenses, so over the last 13 weeks we've accumulated a sizable deficit and we're hoping to erase much of that by the end of the year with special love gifts at this Christmas time.
[time=733] If you'd like to participate in that please write to the Bible our box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=740] The zip code is 46815.
[time=744] Well now it's time for you to meet some of the noises you've heard in the background.
[time=748] We want to introduce you to our families.
[time=750] Each of us have our families here today and it's always special when we get a chance to introduce them to you.
[time=756] I'm going to start off by introducing you to the Dale Siglin family.
[time=760] They're down here all the way to the end.
[time=763] Dale, why don't you introduce the different members of your family?
[time=766] - We're glad to.
[time=767] This is my wife, Mary Kay, who is a nurse.
[time=769] This is my oldest son Steve, who is 15.
[time=772] Mark is 12 and Sarah is just about to be nine.
[time=775] - Just about to be nine.
[time=777] - When's your birthday, Sarah?
[time=778] January 18th, so your parents ever try to give you just one present for your birthday and one for Christmas are usually make out pretty well.
[time=787] - Make out pretty well.
[time=789] - I'm glad for that.
[time=790] Mark, what do you expect under the Christmas tree this year?
[time=793] - Odyssey.
[time=794] - And what is Odyssey?
[time=796] - The TV video game.
[time=798] - TV video game, what are the chances that you're going to find that there this year?
[time=802] - Very good.
[time=803] - Very good, have you been looking in the closets and under your dad's bed?
[time=807] You just are counting on that.
[time=809] Steve's been a friend of mine.
[time=810] When I was the youth pastor of the church, we had a lot of activities together.
[time=814] Steve, you're a freshman this year.
[time=817] What activities are you involved in at school?
[time=819] - I'm a soccer and I manage basketball team.
[time=822] - You manage the basketball team and he's been on the soccer team.
[time=825] Steve's a part of our school, Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=828] Next to the Siglands is the Kruger family and I will guess that you know many of them.
[time=834] Don and his wife often sing duets here in our church and you may recognize Janet also as a part of our musical group entitled Strictly Feminine.
[time=843] Why don't you introduce all of the members of your family?
[time=847] - Now when Rick says all the members, he's meaning our 19 year old son who's not here and yes he is our son and he's at Cedarville College and this is our John, he's five years old and John you can smile to the camera, that's right.
[time=863] And this is Julianne.
[time=864] Honey, you wanna look at the people over there?
[time=866] Julianne, she's nine months old.
[time=870] - Well that's what the Kruger's found under the Christmas tree this year as a new baby girl.
[time=874] John, what do you think of having a new sister in your house?
[time=877] Do you like that?
[time=878] - Yeah.
[time=879] - Do you like that?
[time=880] Would you like another one?
[time=881] You don't like it quite that well.
[time=883] Well we're glad that you're with us today, the whole Kruger family.
[time=887] Down here on the end is some people that are very close to me.
[time=890] This is my family.
[time=892] My wife Kathy is holding our two little girls.
[time=895] Why don't you introduce each of them honey?
[time=897] - This is Rebecca, who's 11 months and this is Rachel who just turned two years old.
[time=901] - Rachel, who's girl are you?
[time=903] - Hey.
[time=904] - Who's girl?
[time=905] - She said daddy's girl, I don't know whether you picked that up, but took me months to train her to say just that.
[time=912] Well these are our little Christmas joys.
[time=914] They're dressed alike, they don't act alike, except for when one's bad, they're usually both bad.
[time=920] We're so thankful you've joined us today.
[time=922] Christmas is a family time and we wanted to share our families with you.
[time=927] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=929] We so appreciate your faithful support of the Bible Hour, both in prayer and in encouragement and also financially.
[time=936] We trust that you'll be praying and considering a special love gift at Christmas time this year for the Bible Hour.
[time=943] Again, we encourage you to write to us at box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=950] The zip code is 46815.
[time=953] And most of all, we hope that this is a very special Christ-centered Christmas for you.
[time=959] And from all of us to all of you, Merry Christmas.

[time=1471] - This year's cantata follows the theme of an old-fashioned Christmas.
[time=1476] So the Black Hawk singers are dressed in some old-fashioned clothing, but the message is to remind us not to let the busyness and the commercialism of today rob the message of Jesus Christ, that you could have an old-fashioned Christmas with Him reigning in your heart.
[time=1493] This morning we have a message that relates to Christmas from Dr. Robert Grimacki, who was a part of the faculty at Cedarville College.
[time=1503] He's a very young-looking man.
[time=1505] He looks about 35.
[time=1507] And then this morning he announced that he was one of the professors and teachers of Dave Jeremiah.
[time=1512] He looks 10 years younger than Dave.
[time=1514] I wish he was here to let me rib him a little bit.
[time=1517] I'm sure he's getting his licks in on me out in California.
[time=1521] But this morning we welcome Dr. Grimacki to our church.
[time=1524] And invite him now to share with us the message that God has given him to give to us.
[time=1530] Dr. Robert Grimacki.
[time=1533] Well, thank you, Rick. Christmas comes early.
[time=1537] That was a nice gift, my almighty.
[time=1541] Flattery will get you everything, right?
[time=1544] It's a real joy to be here at Black Hawk.
[time=1549] I told the first service that way back in 1970, Dave Jeremiah invited me to speak to his congregation.
[time=1558] And in that time they were meeting in two trailers that were put side-by-side.
[time=1564] So it's been a long time and it's been great to see how God has used Dave and the staff here and the good people here at Black Hawk.
[time=1573] Praise God for the outreach of the gospel here in Fort Wayne and through the television ministry.
[time=1581] That song that the Black Hawk singers just sang is a very appropriate to the message.
[time=1588] Why can't Christmas just be Christmas?
[time=1591] What is Christmas?
[time=1593] The Apostle Paul wrote in Galatians chapter 4, verse 4, "When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman." That's Christmas.
[time=1609] Christmas is no accident.
[time=1611] It was all within God's design and purpose when the fullness of time was come.
[time=1619] God is never early and God is never late.
[time=1623] It was the right time for His Son to become man and 2,000 years ago, God the eternal Son came into this time-space universe and came into the womb of Mary and was born.
[time=1643] He came to become man and to go to the cross to redeem.
[time=1648] Now when we think of the virgin birth of Christ, we need to realize that there are three who had a very important part, God obviously, Mary and also Joseph.
[time=1664] In this morning, I want us to focus our attention on the birth announcements that are contained in two of the Gospels in Matthew and Luke.
[time=1673] I invite your attention first of all to the Gospel of Luke.
[time=1678] Luke chapter 1, and look with me at verse 26.
[time=1683] It says, "In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth." Now when you come to the Gospel account of our Lord's birth and to this announcement, immediately the supernatural will grip you.
[time=1706] We are not talking about something that is natural, something that occurs every once in a while.
[time=1714] No, this event occurred only once in the history of the world.
[time=1719] We're going to read about angels.
[time=1721] We're going to read about the Holy Spirit.
[time=1724] We're going to read about God the Father.
[time=1729] And when you come to the virgin conception and birth of Jesus Christ, you move into the realm of the miraculous.
[time=1737] You move into the realm of the supernatural.
[time=1741] Jesus Christ is no mere man born of mortal parents.
[time=1747] No, is God manifest in the flesh?
[time=1751] And Paul calls this the mystery of godliness.
[time=1755] And here we read in Luke 1, 26, that in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel came.
[time=1762] What is the sixth month?
[time=1764] Well, later on, if you look at verse 36, in order to authenticate the fact that Mary would be the mother of the Messiah,
[time=1775] the angel said, "Behold, thy cousin Elizabeth." She hath also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
[time=1786] And so we are in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy.
[time=1790] Who's Elizabeth?
[time=1792] Well, Elizabeth is the wife of Zacharias.
[time=1795] And if you look at the first part of Luke chapter 1, you'll find that Zacharias was told by the same angel that he and his wife would become the parents of John the Baptist,
[time=1809] the forerunner of Jesus Christ.
[time=1811] And Isaiah says, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness make ye ready the way of the Lord." And John was that person.
[time=1821] And with Elizabeth six months pregnant with John, the angel came to Mary and said, verse 27, says, "He came to a virgin as spouse to a man whose name was Joseph."
[time=1835] Mary was a virgin, folks.
[time=1837] A virgin at the time of conception and a virgin at the time of birth.
[time=1842] You will read in some books written by men of religion that Mary was not a virgin.
[time=1849] They'll say that Jesus was born of Mary and Joseph, either in a proper marital relationship or in an illicit relationship.
[time=1860] That's blasphemy.
[time=1861] Some have even suggested that Jesus was born of Mary and a Samaritan man.
[time=1867] After all, Nazareth was near the border.
[time=1869] And the critics of Jesus later on said, "Don't you have a demon and aren't you a Samaritan?
[time=1875] Where is your father?" That subtle inference, though, was blasphemous.
[time=1882] Jesus Christ did not begin to exist at conception.
[time=1887] He always existed as God the Son.
[time=1890] And Mary was a virgin.
[time=1892] The Scripture is clear on that.
[time=1894] She was betrothed.
[time=1896] She was a spouse.
[time=1897] In that day, in that culture, Jewish parents could betrothed their children.
[time=1903] Or a couple could betrothed themselves.
[time=1906] We don't know what the situation was with Mary and Joseph, but they were legally married.
[time=1912] There was a contract binding them in marriage, and yet they had not come together to consummate it in a physical way.
[time=1923] We're told that she was of the house of David.
[time=1927] If you just turn briefly over to chapter three, you'll find there a very lengthy genealogy.
[time=1935] What do you do when you come to a genealogy in your devotional reading?
[time=1940] I imagine you just skip on until you find a narrative.
[time=1944] And yet it's true that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable.
[time=1951] There must be some reason why God gave so much space to genealogies.
[time=1957] Well, here in Luke chapter three, you actually have the genealogy of Mary, and it goes back in verse 31 to David through Nathan.
[time=1967] Mary could trace her physical ancestry all the way back to David through Nathan and then David all the way back to Abraham and back to Adam.
[time=1978] And so she is of the house of David, and we're told the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=1984] Now look at verse 28.
[time=1986] And the angel came into her and said, "Hail thou that art highly favored." He greets her, "Hail," and then he says something about her.
[time=1996] Now, if you have an authorized version, you'll see that the words "thou that art" are in italics.
[time=2003] "Hail highly favored one." What does it mean to be a highly favored one?
[time=2012] That word contains within it the word greets.
[time=2017] "Hail one who has been graced by another." "Hail one who has received grace from God" is the meaning of it.
[time=2028] He doesn't say that Mary is full of grace or that Mary is full of favor or that she is gracious in and of herself.
[time=2038] No, she has been graced by someone else.
[time=2042] And that someone is God.
[time=2047] You and I, who have been born again, have been graced also.
[time=2055] The Apostle Paul said, "For by grace are you saved through faith." And that, not of yourselves, it's the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.
[time=2067] And you and I have received the grace of God.
[time=2071] We are what we are by the grace of God.
[time=2074] Praise God for that.
[time=2077] We've been saved, we've been gifted.
[time=2080] All of our life is an expression of God's grace.
[time=2085] And Mary could say the same thing.
[time=2088] There wasn't anything special in and of herself that God would choose her.
[time=2095] She became what she was by the grace of God.
[time=2099] And the angel is saying that to her.
[time=2102] Hail, highly favored one, one who has been graced by another.
[time=2106] The Lord is with you, blessed art thou among women.
[time=2111] Now that's a fantastic statement.
[time=2113] He doesn't say, "Blessed are you above women." No, he's not exalting Mary to a position that she does not deserve.
[time=2123] And yet she needs to be praised for that position that God is using her.
[time=2130] Blessed art thou among women, not above women.
[time=2134] And then this word blessed is interesting.
[time=2136] Again, it means one who has been blessed by another.
[time=2140] The angel is not saying, "Mary, you are blessed in and of yourself, and therefore you can bless others." Oh no, only God can do that, folks.
[time=2150] Just turn the page or further on in chapter one in your Bible.
[time=2156] And look at verse 67.
[time=2158] I want you to see a contrast in this word blessed.
[time=2163] When John the Baptist was born, his father Zacharias was able to speak.
[time=2170] It's amazing about Zacharias because he did not believe that he and Elizabeth would have a child in their elder years.
[time=2179] He came dumb for the next nine months.
[time=2181] He couldn't speak.
[time=2182] I think some of you ladies would like your husbands to be like that for nine months.
[time=2187] But when the baby was born, his mouth was opened, and the spirit of God came upon him,
[time=2194] and he became a prophet.
[time=2196] And according to chapter one, in verse 67, it says, "And his father Zacharias was filled
[time=2202] with the Holy Spirit in prophesied, saying," now what did he say?
[time=2206] "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel." You see that word, blessed?
[time=2211] It's close to the one that's used for Mary, but it's different.
[time=2217] You law Gaetos.
[time=2219] Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.
[time=2222] It's the same word that Paul used in Ephesians chapter one.
[time=2226] Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.
[time=2235] You see, only God is blessed in and of himself.
[time=2239] And because he is blessed, because that's one of his qualities, one of his characteristics,
[time=2245] he can then bestow it on others.
[time=2248] He's done that with you and with me.
[time=2251] Just think you and I chosen in Christ before the foundation world.
[time=2255] In him, forgiveness of sins were accepted into the beloved one.
[time=2260] What wonderful spiritual blessings those are.
[time=2263] And Mary also had been blessed by the blessed God.
[time=2269] Blessed are you among women, among women, he says in verse 28.
[time=2274] Now look at verse 29 with me, folks, in Luke 1.
[time=2278] It says, "And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying.
[time=2284] And cast in her mind what manner salutation this should be." Well, you would be too. How many of you have ever seen an angel?
[time=2293] How many of you have ever talked with an angel?
[time=2296] You're in a room and all at once an angel appears and speaks to you.
[time=2300] You would be startled and you would be amazed.
[time=2303] Just a natural response.
[time=2306] Then the angel said under fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
[time=2312] You see that?
[time=2313] Now that word favor is what you have back in verse 28, highly favored.
[time=2318] You have found grace. You found favor.
[time=2322] Where is it? It's with God. It's not in you, but it's with God.
[time=2328] Folks, I hope that at this Christmas season that you have found grace with God.
[time=2335] It's not to be found in me. It's not to be found in anyone connected with Blackhawk.
[time=2341] It's not to be found in any human being. It's to be found with God.
[time=2348] Oh, to have that grace, the grace of salvation, and the grace that sustains you day by day.
[time=2356] You find that with God. He's the source of it.
[time=2360] It says, "You have found grace with God. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb.
[time=2365] You shall bring forth the Son, and you shall call His name Jesus."
[time=2372] What a marvelous name Jesus from the Hebrew, Jehovah is salvation.
[time=2380] What a name. Call His name Jesus.
[time=2384] Then he says this, "He shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the highest."
[time=2391] He doesn't say, "He shall become the Son of the highest." No, no.
[time=2397] When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son.
[time=2404] He was the Son before He was sent. He was the Son before He was made of a woman.
[time=2411] No, He shall be called the Son of the highest. He doesn't become the Son of the highest.
[time=2418] When the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His Father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.
[time=2431] Folks, there are three key words there.
[time=2436] Throne, house, kingdom. Do you see those?
[time=2441] Why are they so important? Keep your finger there.
[time=2444] Come on back with me to 2 Samuel 7.
[time=2449] Way back in 2 Samuel 7, and in verse 16, God made a promise to David.
[time=2457] David lived about a thousand years before Jesus Christ.
[time=2463] And in this promise, in this covenant, God said something to David that has lasted down through the years.
[time=2471] He said, "Thine house, and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee, thy throne shall be established forever."
[time=2479] Do you see those words? House, kingdom, throne.
[time=2484] And what the angel Gabriel was telling Mary is this, that those promises that God gave to David are going to be fulfilled in your Son.
[time=2495] He will be the Son of David. Whenever Jesus asked His critics, "Who's the Messiah?"
[time=2503] They were right on this answer. They said, "He's the Son of David." That's right.
[time=2508] Your Son will be the Son of David. He'll be the Messiah. But more than that, He'll be the Son of the highest.
[time=2513] The Son of deity, two natures in one person, God become man, the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2523] Now Mary's response in verse 34 is not a response of unbelief, it's just a question of, "Well, how can it take place?"
[time=2532] She says, "How shall this be, sing I know not a man?" Well, she knew what a man was. She was married to one, legally.
[time=2541] She knew the difference between female and male.
[time=2545] But of course, she's using the word "no" in an intimate way.
[time=2549] "How shall this be, sing I know not a man sexually, intimately?"
[time=2557] By the way, from her own lips, she is admitting that at this point in her life, she is still a virgin.
[time=2563] "I know not a man." Now here's the answer.
[time=2567] And look at it closely, folks. It's very, very important.
[time=2571] The angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
[time=2588] Mary, this is how it's going to occur.
[time=2591] The Holy Spirit of God is going to fill you. The Holy Spirit of God is going to envelop you.
[time=2600] He's going to surround you, and in that moment, God the Son will come into your body and into your womb and into your ovum, and life will be conceived apart from male fertilization.
[time=2615] From that point, cell mitosis will take over, and you'll have the development of the fetus for nine months.
[time=2625] That's how it's going to take place. No man involved. God's involved.
[time=2632] Now folks, that's a miracle.
[time=2635] Oftentimes we talk about the virgin birth. Really the miracle of the incarnation is in the conception because Mary's term of pregnancy was normal.
[time=2648] Her delivery was normal. Now a stable is not the best place to have a baby. I think you ladies would prefer a hospital.
[time=2657] But there have been babies born in Volkswagen's, I've been told. Elevators, taxicabs. That's rather awkward.
[time=2669] No, the miracle is in the conception. That is when God became man.
[time=2675] Now look at verse 36.
[time=2677] It says, "And behold, I cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived the son in her old age, and this is the six months with her who was called barren for with God, nothing shall be impossible." That's right.
[time=2691] You believe that folks?
[time=2693] When God says that he's going to do something, he'll do it.
[time=2699] And everything that God does is good, perfect, and just. Everything that God determines and does is a reflection of his very being with God. Nothing shall be impossible.
[time=2716] And look at verse 38. Mary said, "May it happen." She says, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." She says, "I'm now available."
[time=2730] She says, "I am willing to do what God wants to do in and through my life."
[time=2736] Mary is a remarkable woman, and we do deserve to praise her for her contribution to the redemptive purpose of God. Let me just take you for a moment over to chapter 1, verse 46.
[time=2752] Mary then left to visit Elizabeth. And in verse 46, Mary on that occasion praises God for what's taking place, and she says, "My soul death magnified the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior."
[time=2769] Mary needed a Savior just like you and I do. The only person who needs a Savior is a sinner. At some point in her life, she admitted to God that she was a sinner. She could not save herself, and she realized that only God could do it, and she trusted him and received salvation.
[time=2792] "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." She did that. I hope you have too.
[time=2799] She went on to say, "He hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden, for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed." All generations. That means 1981.
[time=2811] And you and I ought to call her blessed. And by the way, that's another different word. This is the word happy. It's the same word that's found in the Beatitudes. Blessed are the pure and blessed are the peacemakers.
[time=2824] Mary is happy to know that God is using her. If you're being used by God, you're happy too. Joyce in the Lord all the way, and again I say rejoice. There is joy in serving the Lord. There is no joy outside of the will of God. They'll call me blessed.
[time=2845] Now I want you to turn with me to Matthew chapter 1. I want you to see Joseph's part in all of this. Sometimes Joseph is almost the forgotten man. And although he had nothing to do with the physical conception and birth of Christ, yet he had a very important part to play in God's program.
[time=2872] Now look at Matthew chapter 1 and verse 18. It says, "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise, when as his mother, Mary was espoused to Joseph." Now Matthew says the same thing that Luke does. And that is that they were legally betrothed. Then it says, "Before they came together, before they had sexual relations, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."
[time=2901] It wasn't very long before Mary could not conceal the fact that she was pregnant. And when Joseph discovered it, what could he think? He knew that Mary had just gone into the hill country to visit Elizabeth and maybe Mary met somebody there, younger, more handsome, maybe Mary had an illicit relationship.
[time=2927] What could Mary say? She could not defend herself, could she? Stop and think about it. Put yourself in her shoes. How could she defend herself? She could say, "Now Joseph, I know what you're thinking, but it didn't really happen that way. Here are the facts, believe it or not."
[time=2951] One night I was in my bedroom and this bright and shining light appeared like that one over there. And all at once I could distinguish that there was a form there at the foot of my bed.
[time=2966] And the closer I looked, it looked like a man and he spoke and he had a man's voice and I found out that his name was Gabriel, but really it wasn't a man, it was an angel. And you know what this angel told me, Joseph? He told me that God would come upon me, the Holy Spirit would come upon me and I would have God's baby. And this baby that I'm carrying is really God's child. Believe it or not.
[time=2993] Would you believe that? No way you would believe that. Joseph said, "I've heard a lot of tales at the corner barbershop in my time, but that one." How could she defend herself? There's no way. God had to explain the situation to Joseph and he did.
[time=3013] Look at verse 19. It says, "Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man," right. Joseph was a safe man. He tried to live according to the will of God. He tried to live according to the Mosaic Law as a good Jew.
[time=3029] And he realized that in Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse 1 that if he found uncleanness in his betrothed wife that he should put her away, that he should give her a bill of divorcements, he did not want to pass on his inheritance and his birthright to a child that was not really his.
[time=3051] And so he could not go ahead with the marriage. And yet we are told in verse 19 that he loved her. Says not willing to make her a public example.
[time=3061] She's ridiculed him. She's disgraced him. But he doesn't want to drag her out into the street and say, "Look what Mary's done to me. Stoner." No.
[time=3071] Quite often you may be wronged. And your first reaction is to grab that person and shout it from the housetop. Look what this person's done to me.
[time=3081] But love covers a multitude of sins, folks. And sometimes the best thing to do is to keep it as private and quiet as possible.
[time=3093] And that's what Joseph wanted to do. He says that he was going to put her away or divorce her privately, not publicly, but he was going to go ahead with it, the divorce.
[time=3103] Well, look at verse 20. He went to bed. And that night an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream.
[time=3113] Now in the text it says the angel of the Lord, in the authorized version. If you have a reference Bible, you'll see that the word "the" is not there. It really says "an angel of the Lord."
[time=3125] When you study Scripture, you need to look for those little differences. The reason for that is this, that in the Old Testament you read about the angel of the Lord.
[time=3136] And in the Old Testament the angel of the Lord is a reference to God the Son before the incarnation. God the Son is the one who manifested God to man.
[time=3149] And he took on human form in the Old Testament to reveal God's purposes to man. He was not human. He just simply took on the form, much like angels did.
[time=3161] But after the incarnation, after the virgin conception, the phrase "the angel of the Lord" disappears from the New Testament.
[time=3172] And the reason for that is that God the Son has become incarnate, and he's Jesus Christ, and is one mediator between God and man.
[time=3180] It's the man Christ Jesus. You don't find that. The Spirit of God guiding the New Testament writers to make that observation.
[time=3188] Now this angel said to Joseph, "Joseph thou son of David." Now Joseph was the son of David too. If you take a look at Matthew, the opening verses, you'll find here the genealogy. This is the genealogy of Joseph.
[time=3204] And Joseph had royal blood in his veins. He could trace his background to David through Solomon and through the kings. You see that in verse 6.
[time=3214] Carpenter, yes. But he also had royal blood prevented by the Roman occupation, prevented by the Jewish religious rule. But nevertheless, he was a son of David.
[time=3230] He says, "fear not to take unto thee, marry thy wife," or that which is conceived in here as of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3235] Actually, he's trying to encourage Joseph to do it. Once Joseph finds out that Mary had been controlled by the Spirit, and that Mary's child was really of the Holy Spirit, and that child is really God the Son, he might fear even a touch her physically.
[time=3260] He might even be afraid to take her by the hand and walk across the street. You might think, "Well, she's too holy. I dare not defile her." No, Joseph. Fear not to take her.
[time=3276] She shall bring forth a son, and you, Joseph, you call his name Jesus. When the father claimed, or when the father named the child, in that day, he was claiming the legal paternity of that child.
[time=3294] And Joseph was to name him in order that people might recognize this is the son of Joseph and Mary, and the birthright of Joseph, the right to rule as one of the kings. That right would go to Christ.
[time=3313] Of course, he wasn't the real son of Joseph, but you name him. You call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. That's why he came, folks. What's Christmas all about? When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons, he came to save.
[time=3340] In the concert last night, it was so beautifully portrayed that the Christ in the cradle is also the Christ of the cross. He came to die for you and for me. He'll save his people from their sins, and then it says, "This is done that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, and we have a quotation from Isaiah 7, 14, that great, great passage.
[time=3365] Behold, of virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth his son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, God with us."
[time=3374] What's remarkable about that prophecy, folks, in the Hebrew is this, that it points out that she is to be a virgin, not only at the time of conception, but also at the time of birth.
[time=3387] It actually says the pregnant virgin shall bear a son. Now, you can be a virgin, can't you ladies, at the time of conception, but you are not a virgin nine months later.
[time=3401] But Mary was to be a virgin both at the time of conception and nine months later at the time of birth.
[time=3410] That's why we talk about the virgin birth. It is correct, virgin conception, virgin birth. Now, look at verse 24.
[time=3418] And Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord, had been him and took unto him his wife. He brought Mary into his bedroom.
[time=3426] I take it, he brought her into his bed. Everybody in the community thought that they were consummating the legal betrothal in a physical way.
[time=3435] But actually, verse 25 says, he knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son. He didn't know her intimately, but he did not know her intimately until after the birth of Jesus.
[time=3453] Why? Because if he had known her intimately before, it would have violated the fact that she had to be a virgin both at conception and birth.
[time=3464] And Joseph, in total obedience to the will of God, is also under the direction of the spirit of God and is being used of God to fulfill Scripture.
[time=3476] He knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he, Joseph, called his name Jesus.
[time=3486] Isn't that a wonderful account? The Word of God, how Matthew and Luke join forces and by the Spirit of God are able to give to us this.
[time=3498] Has he saved you from your sins? Can you really say, I have found grace with God through the gracious Son of the Lord Jesus Christ?
