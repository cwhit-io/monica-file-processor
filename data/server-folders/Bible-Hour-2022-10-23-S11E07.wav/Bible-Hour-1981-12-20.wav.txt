[time=70] Welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=73] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the word of God.
[time=80] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion,
[time=86] and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=91] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=96] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger
[time=102] will share with you special information concerning the Bible hour.
[time=107] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=117] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=127] And at this time, we want to welcome those who are joining us today for the Bible hour behind me as the living Christmas tree filled with double life today.
[time=137] This is not our adult choir, this is our youth choir, and it is alive.
[time=141] They've been practicing for many months now.
[time=144] Jim Richard, our youth pastor, has assembled them together, and Emily Pippen has been training them in music,
[time=150] and they're going to sing for us now two Christmas songs, the Living Christmas Tree Youth Choir.
[time=156] [MUSIC]
[time=176] The Virgin Mary had a baby boy, the Virgin Mary had a baby boy, the Virgin Mary had a baby boy, and they said that his name was Jesus.
[time=194] He come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom, he come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom.
[time=214] [MUSIC]
[time=239] He come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom, he come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom.
[time=258] [MUSIC]
[time=284] He come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom, he come from the glory, he come from the glorious kingdom.
[time=304] The Virgin Mary had a baby boy, the Virgin Mary had a baby boy.
[time=324] [MUSIC]
[time=347] A soft light is glowing, a gentle is glowing, and it's early more.
[time=357] The angels are singing, those ends are ringing, the baby is born.
[time=367] Always and I cherish the evening, oh, in the well.
[time=386] [MUSIC]
[time=412] Always and I cherish the evening, oh, in the well.
[time=437] The hope is growing, there's peace of our flowing, the wonder is done, this joyful receiving by only believing in the Father's Son.
[time=456] Always and I cherish the evening, oh, in the well.
[time=497] [MUSIC]
[time=514] That was well done, what an encouragement it is to hear our young people sing praises to Jesus Christ.
[time=521] This is a busy time of year with the living Christmas tree, we've had 13 concerts, we've got two more to go, I wish I could invite all of you to come back.
[time=530] You're welcome too, you just won't be able to get in, the tickets have been gone for over a month now, but it's such a joy to share on the outreach ministry of the living Christmas tree.
[time=541] For our youth choir is going to sing for us, there shall never be another.
[time=567] Never be another man to walk up on the sea, never be another man could die for you and me, never me.
[time=596] [MUSIC]
[time=599] Never be another garden or it just meant that night in prayer, never be a mother in Tony, like the one accomplished man, never be, never be.
[time=628] [MUSIC]
[time=632] Never be another, never be another, never be another man, never be a son, like the one that jumped for me.
[time=661] [MUSIC]
[time=664] Never be, never be, never be, never be another man to carry God's own son,
[time=689] never be another Joseph, to raise a chosen one, never be, never be, never be, never be, never be.
[time=711] Never be another, never be another man, never be a son, like the one that jumped for me.
[time=740] Never be, never be, never be, never be, never be, never be, never be, never be.
[time=769] Never be, never be, never be.
[time=795] Hello, I'm sure you've noticed it's Christmas time here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and I hope that you enjoyed the youth living Christmas tree choir. Christmas is a very busy time for us particularly for you, isn't it, Don?
[time=808] Extremely busy, but very, very exciting, Rick.
[time=811] The reason why Don is so busy is we have a Christmas cantata that we do several times in total, how many concerts will there be, Don?
[time=819] This afternoon we'll do our 14th and 15th concert, and we've been doing them over 10 days.
[time=825] Well, that will wear both Don and the choir out, and I know that it's been an encouragement for each person that's had a part in it.
[time=832] We expect about 16,000 different people to come to this year's musical.
[time=837] That makes it our largest outreach except for the ministry of television.
[time=842] This year is a special year for us with the Living Christmas Tree because the cantata that our choir is singing is entitled, "God Wrote the Song," and it was written by a good friend of mine and a good friend of yours.
[time=853] He's sitting with me. Don, tell him a little bit about the cantata, would you?
[time=857] Well, I'm just thrilled, Rick, that Singspiration has taken this cantata and published it, and people have been using it around the country.
[time=864] And you can just imagine what it would be to direct this cantata in your own church with your own people, so we've just been having a very exciting time.
[time=872] It's a cantata that I've written over the last few years, and it explains how God used the wise men in the shepherds and the angels and Mary and Joseph to tell the whole world that a Savior is born.
[time=885] And what we're trying to get across in this cantata is not just that the Savior, the baby is born, but that a Savior, the Savior, the world has come, and that He can be the Savior of anyone who believes.
[time=897] And one of the highlight songs in this is a song that I wrote about seven years ago.
[time=901] It's called "No Room Tonight," explains that if Christ would come tonight, would you be able to say, "Yes, welcome into my life, Lord Jesus?"
[time=908] For me, that is the highlight. It comes in the middle of the cantata, but that always just speaks to my own heart, asking people if they have room for Jesus Christ in their life.
[time=919] Don, it's a beautiful cantata, and I'm sure thankful for the talent that God's given you, and that I've had a chance to be a part of this year's living Christmas tree.
[time=927] Rick has been preaching each night, giving a segment right after our wise men song, and that has always been really a blessing and an encouragement to the people telling people that wise men today who know still seek Him, wise men still seek Him.
[time=944] I appreciate that, Rick.
[time=945] We wish we could invite you to join us, but for over a month, all the tickets have been taken for this year's living Christmas tree, but we have a chance to share part of it with you these last two Sundays on television.
[time=956] We have something else we'd like to share with you also.
[time=959] That's this new daily Bible study called Timeless Insights.
[time=963] This is a daily walk version of a New Testament study.
[time=967] We've jokingly called the daily walk the monthly leap, because we have had so much reading to do.
[time=973] This slows down the pace a little bit and allows you to study through the New Testament in one year.
[time=979] Why don't you share just a little bit about the book, Don?
[time=982] It's a tremendous little book, Rick. It has quotes in it from great men like G. Campbell Morgan and D.L. Moody, and little thoughts insights for every single day.
[time=993] It's something that I'm sure you would like to have, and if you would like to write to us, we'd be glad to send you your copy of Timeless Insights right to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, 1-5-000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 4-6-8-1-5, and we would be just delighted to share this with you.
[time=1011] Timeless Insights thoughts for every single day quotes and practical helps for you by great men like G. Campbell Morgan and D.L. Moody.
[time=1020] Write to us at the Bible Hour at Box 15,000, 1-5-000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 4-6-8-1-5. We'll rush your copy.
[time=1031] We would love to hear from you today requesting Timeless Insights. We'd also like to ask you to be praying and consider supporting the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=1041] Over the past 13 weeks, our deficit has accumulated to a sizable amount. We've had some ongoing expenses from the early days of the ministry.
[time=1050] So as we close out this year, we are somewhere around $50,000 behind in our need of finances.
[time=1058] Won't you please consider supporting the Bible Hour during this Christmas season?
[time=1063] God bless you, and we trust that you'll have a great day. Merry Christmas.
[time=1078] And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God under a city of Galilean named Nazareth to a virgin,
[time=1086] who was spoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=1093] And the angel came in unto her and said, "Mary, Mary, the Lord highly favored, the Lord is with thee.
[time=1116] Blessed are thou among women, for thou shalt conceive and bear a son.
[time=1129] Thou hast from favor with God.
[time=1136] Mary, Mary."
[time=1144] And when she saw him, she was troubled at his say and considered in her mind what manner of greeting this should be.
[time=1152] And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast thou favored with God.
[time=1159] And behold, thou shalt conceive and thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall clone his name, Jesus."
[time=1189] But while Joseph thought of these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,
[time=1198] "Joseph, Joseph, fear not to take unto thee, Mary, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1218] She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[time=1231] For he shall save his people from their sins, Jesus, Jesus."
[time=1255] Thank you, Dave and Peggy, that beautiful song about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, that they just sang for us was written, and as a part of Don Kruger's Cantata, God wrote the song.
[time=1266] Now, Dave and Peggy prepare our hearts through the ministry of music by singing for us what a wonderful name is Jesus.
[time=1275] What a beautiful name is Jesus, what a beautiful name to me.
[time=1300] Whisper to the Virgin Mary heralded by choirs of angels, name of him who came to save his people from their sins.
[time=1312] What a beautiful name, a wonderful name, what a beautiful name is Jesus.
[time=1327] What a beautiful name is Jesus, what a beautiful name to me.
[time=1340] Isaiah called him wonderful, the counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, and the coming prince of peace.
[time=1352] What a beautiful name, a wonderful name, what a beautiful, wonderful name is Jesus.
[time=1378] It is good for our hearts to focus in on the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, not just at Christmas time,
[time=1385] but each day and each moment of our life, that our attention and our devotion beyond him.
[time=1391] God has sent us a messenger today, Dr. Martin Clark.
[time=1395] He is a member of the faculty of Cedarville College.
[time=1398] We've had a number of good people come and speak to us from Cedarville.
[time=1402] Dr. Paul Dixon, about a month ago, the president of Cedarville came and then recently last week, Dr. Robert Kramaki.
[time=1409] You're in good company and we welcome you and invite you today to lead us in our study of God's Word, Martin Clark.
[time=1424] As you open your copy of God's Word this morning to Matthew chapter 1, let me tell you what a joy it is for me to be here and to be here last night to receive the wonderful ministry of the living Christmas tree.
[time=1437] What a time of spiritual enrichment and refreshment that was for me.
[time=1442] And then to be able to share with you this day some thoughts from the Word of God concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1451] In Matthew chapter 1, we'll begin reading, please, in verse 18, and I invite you to follow in your copy of God's Word as I read.
[time=1461] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise or in this way.
[time=1467] When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
[time=1476] Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.
[time=1484] While he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying,
[time=1490] "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
[time=1498] And she shall bring forth his son, and thou shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins."
[time=1506] Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying,
[time=1512] "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth his son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,"
[time=1521] which being interpreted is God with us. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his Word.
[time=1530] The situation in this text is this. Joseph and Mary were engaged to be married.
[time=1537] And it was the custom of that time in that part of the world that when a couple became engaged or betrothed,
[time=1547] that the engagement period usually lasted about a year. And during that year they were perhaps more engaged than we think of engagement here.
[time=1556] That is to say the bond was almost a covenant or a contractual bond to be married, and it was so strong that in order to break an engagement,
[time=1567] they had to go through the process of writing a bill of divorcement. And that is to say that you couldn't just break an engagement
[time=1574] by breaking an engagement. You had to get divorced. And so it was much more serious and much more binding situation
[time=1583] than we think of in our society in terms of engagement. But at any rate, that's the situation in which they found themselves.
[time=1591] And then all of a sudden during this year period, Mary is found to be pregnant. Now Mary knew what was going on,
[time=1600] because prior to this, the Lord had given her a message through an angelic announcement that she was chosen to be the one who would bear the Messiah.
[time=1611] So she knew what was going on. She probably didn't understand it anymore than, well, perhaps she understood it more than you and I,
[time=1618] because she's the one that experienced it. But yet there was a great mystery there, and she recounts this mystery in one passage of Scripture that we have recorded for us.
[time=1627] But yet, as she knew what was going on, Joseph did it. Perhaps she had tried to explain it to him. Perhaps she had tried to explain what was happening in her life.
[time=1640] But can you imagine trying to understand an explanation like that? Try to put yourself in Joseph's place for a little while.
[time=1649] And that would be a very difficult place to be in, I would imagine. In that society, if that were to happen, he would have felt defrauded. He would have felt wronged.
[time=1660] And many people would have taken a rather cruel or vindictive approach. Joseph, the text tells us, was a just man. Apparently he was a very kind man.
[time=1671] He wanted to follow with the law and the custom dictated for the time, but he wanted to find a way to do it that was most kind, most compassionate, most temperate.
[time=1682] And so he wanted to put her away privately. That is to say, go through this divorcement procedure which the custom allowed, but to do so in a way in which Mary would not be scandalized in the small community in which they lived.
[time=1701] Surely, Joseph must have been upset and discouraged and confused about the whole situation. And it's in the midst of that that God speaks to Joseph.
[time=1713] And he speaks to him through the angelic messenger, the message that we read just a moment ago. Let's look at some of the things that he said.
[time=1723] Through his angel to Joseph concerning Joseph and Mary's situation. First of all, he assures Joseph that Mary has not been untrue to him.
[time=1735] He also tells Joseph that Mary's pregnancy is unlike any other pregnancy. That is, that which had been conceived in her was of the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit.
[time=1751] Now you understand perhaps that God has a variety of ways in which to produce human bodies. I dare say that every one of us who are here this morning have our human body as a result of a physical union between a man and a woman, a mother and a father.
[time=1770] But you see, God is not limited to that. On one occasion, he made a human body without either a father or a mother when he fashioned Adam from dust.
[time=1781] And on another occasion, he made a human body with a man and not a woman when he created Eve from a part of Adam.
[time=1792] And on this occasion, he made a human body from a woman without a man. So God is not limited to the way in the ways in which he can produce human bodies.
[time=1805] And he tells Joseph that this conception and birth is unlike any other. He goes on to say that the child that's going to be born is going to be a male.
[time=1817] Now, some of us who have awaited the delivery of our children have awaited with some anticipation wondering is it going to be a boy or is it going to be a girl?
[time=1828] And Mary and Joseph didn't have that experience, however. They knew from the beginning that it was going to be a boy.
[time=1835] It was going to be a male and the name was to be Jesus. Jesus is the Greek form of the Old Testament Hebrew name Joshua.
[time=1846] Jesus and Joshua are the same names just in different languages, you understand.
[time=1852] Now, when the angel told Joseph that he was going to name this child Joshua or Jesus, I suppose Joseph would have thought, well, what's the big deal about that?
[time=1863] It's a very common name. There are many Joshua's running around our community already.
[time=1870] Because you see, it was the hope and the dream of probably most all Jewish mothers that their son was going to be the promised deliverer.
[time=1881] The word Joshua means Jehovah's deliverer in Jehovah is salvation.
[time=1887] And they were in hopes that their son would be the one who was coming in fulfillment of prophecy to bring deliverance to Israel.
[time=1897] But notice that though his name was going to be a common name, that is a name like many children of the time shared.
[time=1905] And though the people were hoping for a deliverer, a redeemer, yet this announcement was yet different than the other announcements.
[time=1915] Because you see, this one was to deliver his people not just from the tyranny of Rome or from some hard economic times or from the discouraging situation of a national humiliation.
[time=1929] He was going to deliver his people from their sins. That's quite a deliverance.
[time=1936] And that's a deliverance unlike any other Joshua could ever have done.
[time=1942] Notice that in this message also we see that this Jesus was going to be different from other Joshua's.
[time=1950] He was going to be great. His greatness was going to be unequal.
[time=1953] Because you see, all people have people. That is, we have a people.
[time=1957] Whether we are born into a society or a culture or an ethnic group, we say, "That's my people. I have an identity with that people."
[time=1966] And so we all have people in that sense, people to whom we belong.
[time=1971] But notice that when he says he will save his people from their sin, he's not only talking about the fact that there is a people to whom Jesus would belong.
[time=1981] He's also saying there's a people who would belong to Jesus.
[time=1986] And that's different, isn't it?
[time=1989] It shows his exaltation even in this announcement.
[time=1995] And Mary's son would fulfill Old Testament prophecy.
[time=1999] Then the angel quotes a part of Old Testament prophecy concerning the coming Messiah, Isaiah chapter 7.
[time=2006] And verse 14 is quoted in verse 23 of the text, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth his son, and they shall call his name Immanuel."
[time=2018] And then Matthew adds the interpretation, which being interpreted is, "God with us."
[time=2027] Mary's son would fulfill Old Testament prophecy.
[time=2030] "A unique person," Isaiah prophesied, "would come in a unique way."
[time=2037] He will be Immanuel, that is, "God with us."
[time=2043] And in this name, we have the message of Christmas and the heart of the gospel.
[time=2050] God with us.
[time=2053] You see, Jesus is God.
[time=2056] He is God the Son.
[time=2059] And Jesus being God is also with us.
[time=2064] That is, Jesus became fully human.
[time=2068] He is with us in every way except sin.
[time=2074] Now why would God be with us in this way?
[time=2079] We shall see in a few moments that God took on human form to become our substitute.
[time=2085] To pay a penalty that we could not pay.
[time=2088] To do for us what we could not do for ourselves reconciling us to God.
[time=2096] I think we have to admit, don't we, that we all have a need to experience the presence
[time=2103] of God in our lives.
[time=2106] Aren't there times, usually particular times when we need to feel that God is with us?
[time=2114] You see, we were created for fellowship with God.
[time=2118] Genesis chapter 1 reminds us that God created man in his image, in his likeness.
[time=2126] And it recounts for us the fellowship that God had with Adam and Eve.
[time=2131] We were created for fellowship with God.
[time=2135] We might be with him, that he with us.
[time=2138] But something happened to destroy that relationship that was the sin that entered the world through
[time=2145] the transgression of Adam.
[time=2147] And all of a sudden, that which had been a mutually rewarding and enjoyable relation
[time=2153] of fellowship was disrupted by sin.
[time=2157] And what frustration they found themselves in and what frustration we often find ourselves
[time=2163] in today.
[time=2164] Because you see with the advent of sin into the world, we still had the same need for oneness
[time=2172] and fellowship with God.
[time=2175] But we've erected a barrier to the fulfillment of that need.
[time=2180] And we have thus frustrated ourselves grievously.
[time=2187] In the history of the world, we have seen the sensed need of people to have God with them
[time=2194] in a variety of ways.
[time=2196] As people have progressed in their fallenness, they yet needed to have the sense of God with them and in many societies and in many cultures.
[time=2206] This took the form of idolatry.
[time=2208] Because you see, if you feel that you have a need for your God to be with you, why don't you fashion your God in some image, perhaps out of stone or out of wood or out of clay,
[time=2218] make an image to represent him.
[time=2221] And if you can go to a place of worship where that image is, you can feel that you are with God and God is with you.
[time=2229] Or better yet, if you have some images like this that you could put on a shelf in your home.
[time=2236] Whenever you were in your home, you could look at that shelf and you could see those images and you would have the realization that your gods were with you.
[time=2245] Some people even took to making smaller gods, gods that they could carry with them here or there.
[time=2251] How would you like to have a pocket God?
[time=2255] What a discouraging situation.
[time=2258] Some people want to have a symbol of the presence of God that they could carry with them or perhaps put on a chain around their neck or something like that.
[time=2265] What a distorted view of God that represents.
[time=2268] But yet it shows us that these people had a sense of a need for the presence of God with them.
[time=2275] But having denied the true God, they fashioned an image that they thought they could use to represent God with them.
[time=2287] And how frustrating that became.
[time=2290] Perhaps you have had special times when you wanted to feel the presence of God in an unusual way.
[time=2297] Those lonely times perhaps have doubt.
[time=2300] Frustration and confusion in your life where you've wondered, "Is God really there?"
[time=2307] Or more so, "Is God really here?" Perhaps during those times of loneliness when you have had an experience of loss.
[time=2316] An experience of disappointment.
[time=2320] A time of suffering.
[time=2322] And you have cried out, "Where is God when I need him?"
[time=2328] See, we have a need for the sense of the presence of God in our lives.
[time=2333] Those times that are lonely because of the struggling that goes on inside of us with regard to the purpose of life, the meaning of our lives.
[time=2341] Those times when we're struggling for direction in our lives, God knowing our needs has provided a variety of things in the past to show us that He is with us.
[time=2351] In Old Testament times, for instance, you recall that there was a period of time when the people had a tabernacle and later a temple.
[time=2358] And in both structures there was a room called the Holy of Holies.
[time=2361] And within that Holy of Holies was the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=2366] On the top of the Ark of the Covenant were two cherubim carved there.
[time=2370] And between these carvings of cherubim was the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=2377] And the people could not see that because only one priest once a year could enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for the nation's sins on the day of atonement.
[time=2387] But yet the people knew it was there.
[time=2390] And when it had come there had been a great cloud to demonstrate that it was there.
[time=2395] So the people knew that the presence of God was demonstrated in their midst in that way.
[time=2400] And what a comfort that was for them because that led their procession as they went here and there.
[time=2406] They used it wrongly at times.
[time=2408] In one time they went into battle and they wanted God to be with them, but they didn't particularly want to be with God.
[time=2414] That is their hearts were far from God, but they used the presence of God as demonstrated by the Ark as a kind of good luck charm.
[time=2421] And they took it into battle with them and what happened.
[time=2425] They lost the battle.
[time=2427] They lost the Ark.
[time=2429] They lost that visible symbol of the image of the presence of God for a while.
[time=2439] You know when we realize our need of salvation we need to know that God is Immanuel.
[time=2445] He is with us.
[time=2446] Because when the Spirit of God begins to work in our lives drawing us to salvation we become impressed with the fact that God is transcendent.
[time=2453] He is great.
[time=2454] He is high and lifted up.
[time=2456] And we need to know that.
[time=2459] But you see if that's all we know then what we find out is that God is above us.
[time=2468] While the Spirit works in our lives to bring us to salvation we also become aware that God is holy.
[time=2475] And one of the expressions of the holiness of God is his law.
[time=2479] And we have violated that law.
[time=2482] And we stand condemned under that law and we need to know that.
[time=2487] But if that's all we know we get the impression that God is against us.
[time=2493] But then when we hear the gospel and we hear that God loves us.
[time=2498] And that God in his grace has sent his son in our form to pay the penalty for our transgression against the law of God.
[time=2507] And to reconcile us to himself then we see that God is with us.
[time=2515] The message of the gospel is wrapped up in the word Immanuel.
[time=2521] And how we need to know that God is with us.
[time=2527] As we focus on this phrase yet further.
[time=2531] Let's emphasize for a moment that it is God who is with us.
[time=2537] The conception and birth of Jesus Christ is the incarnation or the putting on of flesh of God the Son.
[time=2548] John chapter one begins this way. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God.
[time=2556] The word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.
[time=2560] All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made.
[time=2566] And then we read, "And the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us."
[time=2573] Isn't it great that he dwelt amongst us?
[time=2576] The word became flesh and lived where we live.
[time=2581] And we beheld his glory. The glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth.
[time=2590] You see the invisible God became visible in human form.
[time=2594] I suppose he could have become visible in other forms as well had he chosen to do so.
[time=2599] I suppose that he could have written his message across the sky with some kind of display of planets or some kind of shooting comet.
[time=2610] But had he put on this cosmic extravaganza we would have been impressed with the existence of God, his majesty perhaps,
[time=2620] for the heavens do declare the glory of God.
[time=2626] But yet we would not have known that he is with us because he took on human form to show that.
[time=2634] We can look into the heavens and see the glory.
[time=2638] But it is when God assumed human form that we found out that he wanted to be with us.
[time=2646] First Timothy we read that God was manifest in the flesh.
[time=2654] God revealed himself in a way with which we can identify.
[time=2660] We need to know not only that God is out there, but that God is here in a very intense, intimate, personal way.
[time=2671] For he created us to experience his own presence.
[time=2676] In Colossians chapter 2 we read that in him that is in Christ all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form.
[time=2688] You see when Jesus took on human form that did not diminish his deity in any way.
[time=2695] All fullness, all deity was dwelling in him.
[time=2703] I've been asked a question several times, perhaps you have too.
[time=2707] I find it most disconcerting and challenging when the question comes from my children.
[time=2713] And some time back they asked me the question like yours perhaps I've asked you, Daddy, what is God like?
[time=2722] I remember one time an adult said to me he said, "Hey my kids asked me what God was like and I said God was a circle."
[time=2730] I thought my goodness. He said then I decided God was a triangle.
[time=2734] I didn't know exactly what he was getting at there either and I'm sure his children didn't.
[time=2739] Because you see we cannot describe God in mathematical figures or two dimensional kinds of drawings for God is a person.
[time=2748] And I came to the conclusion as I'm sure you did too.
[time=2752] That when these young searching hearts are inquiring with that childlike faith that Jesus prized, Daddy, what is God like?
[time=2767] What we need to do is tell them about Jesus.
[time=2771] Because Jesus said he that has seen me has seen the Father.
[time=2777] If you see me you know what God is like. Now isn't that exciting?
[time=2785] Because he came in a seeable form. He came in a touchable form.
[time=2790] What a startling realization this message must have been to Joseph that day.
[time=2796] He probably was confused and despondent about the situation that he faced with Mary not understanding what was going on.
[time=2806] And now he hears the girl to whom he is engaged is going to bear the Messiah.
[time=2814] Now he of all people had no problem believing in the virgin conception and birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2821] I say of all people because once again if you put yourself in his position and if you had heard what Mary no doubt told him about her condition what would you have said?
[time=2833] You would have said yeah sure I believe that and you would have become even more skeptical.
[time=2842] And it was in that time perhaps when God came to Joseph and gave him this message.
[time=2851] But you notice that he didn't have any trouble believing in the virgin conception and birth of Christ.
[time=2856] There are many people in our society today who do have trouble with that.
[time=2861] They dismiss that. They try to hold on to a concept of Jesus without that because they don't understand that God could have made a form for his son in any way other than their form was made.
[time=2873] But you see the key to Joseph's understanding was that this was not just Jesus.
[time=2881] This was Immanuel. Now that was the key to his understanding because you see he understood that God
[time=2889] was assuming human form. Now that in itself is miraculous.
[time=2894] Would you expect God to perform a miracle in a non-miraculous way?
[time=2899] Of course not. This was a unique person.
[time=2905] And he would have a unique beginning in his incarnate ministry.
[time=2913] The Messiah will be God. Not merely a human deliverer to straighten out Israel's discouraging relationship with Rome.
[time=2921] But the God man who would save his people from sin were he not Immanuel he could not be Jesus.
[time=2928] Because every person at that time knew that only God could forgive sin.
[time=2934] Remember on a one occasion Jesus forgave someone their sins and they accused him of blasphemy.
[time=2941] Because in saying that he forgave that man of his sin they were saying you are saying that you are God.
[time=2948] And they were right. They were wrong about him being blasphemous.
[time=2953] They were right in acknowledging that he was saying that he was God.
[time=2959] But you see that's what Immanuel means. God with us.
[time=2964] He was the God man. Sin is a rebellion against an infinitely holy God.
[time=2971] Consequently it has infinite consequences and demands an infinite payment.
[time=2978] Now you and I can't make a payment like that. You understand?
[time=2981] Because any payment that we would make would be tainted by our sin to begin with and would be finite by its very nature.
[time=2987] But God the infinite one can make that payment. But yet if he made it just for us without the incarnation we would wonder if it's for us.
[time=2999] But yet when he assumed human form we knew that he was with us.
[time=3004] And when he assumed human form we see the infinite one paying an infinite penalty as only God could do and paying it for us as only man could do.
[time=3015] This is Immanuel. God with us.
[time=3023] And finally let us focus on the fact that it is God who is with us. We have seen that he is God.
[time=3032] I hope that we understand that with clarity. But now let us see that he is with us.
[time=3037] The phrase with us does not just speak of his omnipresence. The term omnipresence refers to the fact that God is everywhere.
[time=3044] There is no place that we can go where he isn't. The 139th Psalm reminds us of that. We can't go anywhere even in the uttermost part of the sea or the earth.
[time=3056] But what we will be in the presence of God. But you know when we think of the omnipresence of God sometimes we can think of that in a rather impersonal way.
[time=3066] But the word Immanuel reminds us that this is not an impersonal thing that God is communicating to us, but it's intensely personal. God with us personally.
[time=3080] It's not just that he is there. It is that he is here. There's a big difference there isn't there.
[time=3090] The form that he assumed was really human. I don't think that we are stretching anything to say that as a baby he needed to be nursed.
[time=3102] He no doubt needed to be burped. He needed to be changed.
[time=3109] The Scripture says that as a child he grew in wisdom and in stature and how the all-knowing God can grow in wisdom is beyond me, but it says that he did.
[time=3122] As a child running around the streets there, if he were to stub his toe on something, his toe would hurt just like yours does when you stub your toe.
[time=3134] If he were with Joseph in the carpenter shop and he were trying to do some of the things that Joseph was doing and in the process hit his thumb with a mallet, that thumb would smart just like yours does when you hit it with a hammer.
[time=3149] You see, he experienced what we experience. He learned to laugh. He learned to cry. He learned the experience of thirst and hunger and disappointment.
[time=3161] He went through the nitty gritty of life, both the exhilarating and the exhausting.
[time=3170] John writes at the beginning of his first epistle, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life."
[time=3183] Well, that life was manifest and we have seen it and we declare it to you. You see, God, the invisible one, came in a form that we could identify with that could be touched, that could be seen, that could be heard.
[time=3198] And we need that. His incarnation was significantly human. Scripture says, "For we have not a high priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin."
[time=3213] He really experienced the pressures and the hassles that we do. This gives us comfort and confidence for he knows why we pray as we do. We know that he knows why we struggle as we do and why he alone is without sin.
[time=3228] And he is not with us today in the same incarnate form. Following his death and resurrection, he ascended bodily into heaven.
[time=3235] You cannot reach out and touch him as John said that he did in 1 John chapter 1. But does this mean that he is no longer with us, not at all.
[time=3247] His incarnation does not have to be perpetual to be significant. For he has given us his word, the incarnate word has given us a record which is the word of the living God.
[time=3264] He indwells us with his spirit following our salvation. He who was filled with the spirit without measure fills us with his spirit.
[time=3272] He assumes significant residence in the lives of believers. Now he's not incarnate in us in the same way that he was incarnate in his own flesh during those years.
[time=3283] But he is in our lives by his spirit. He is conforming us to his character in his image. And we have significant assurance that he is with us in a very real way.
[time=3293] During those times of challenge, such as the disciples faced, when Jesus said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you."
[time=3308] What a challenge. And yet he says, "And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." What comfort, what encouragement in that challenge.
[time=3319] And some of you have been where the psalmist spoke of when he wrote, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me."
[time=3334] And what comfort that brings. I mentioned a moment ago that to be Savior he had to be Emmanuel.
[time=3342] The opposite side of that coin is equally true. To be Emmanuel, you are Emmanuel. He must be your Savior, your Jesus.
[time=3351] Do you need this morning the assurance that God is with you?
[time=3356] I encourage you to trust in Christ as your Savior.
[time=3360] Realize that you cannot save yourself. Realize that Jesus made full and complete payment for your sin. And trust in him.
[time=3370] And his substitution for your eternal life. This is the message of Emmanuel.
[time=3377] God with us. Charles Wesley wrote, "Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord, late in time behold him come, offspring of a virgin's womb, veiled in flesh, the Godhead seed, hail the incarnate deity, pleased as man with men to dwell."
[time=3405] Jesus, our Emmanuel. I trust he is your Emmanuel because he has been your Jesus. Let us pray.
[time=3416] Our gracious Father, we thank you that by your infinite grace and love for us, you made this plan of salvation possible.
[time=3426] And not only do you save us, but you stay with us and what it encouraging and comfortable.
