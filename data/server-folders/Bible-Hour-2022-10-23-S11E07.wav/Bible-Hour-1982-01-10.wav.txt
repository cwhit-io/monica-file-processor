[time=0] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] Welcome to the Bible Hour. Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=77] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=88] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=93] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prooger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=104] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=114] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=124] Welcome today, a great number of people who are usually able to go to church but who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=131] On these cold winter mornings, it's a special blessing for us to be able to share the ministry of the Word of God and the music that brings praise to the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=141] With all who are not able to be in church because of the snow conditions and the blizzard conditions, it's minus 64 chill factor.
[time=149] I know that many of you are at home today watching the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Thank you for joining us, and we trust that today will be a time of encouragement in your life spiritually as a result of the ministry that God has for you during this hour.
[time=164] We have as our special guest speaking for us today, Dr. Don Jennings, and we'll introduce him to you in a few moments, share with you some background about him.
[time=174] Our choir has gathered through the snow and they've made it, we're appreciative of their extra effort to be here today, and they sing a great hymn of praise to begin our worship, that hymn from the Messiah by Handel, the Hallelujah Chorus, the sanctuary choir under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=204] (singing in foreign language)
[time=354] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language)
[time=411] (singing in foreign language) - Our hearts sing along with them praises
[time=428] to our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=430] You have to ask what causes 50 to 60 choir members to make their way through a blizzard condition and hundreds of people to fill this auditorium even on a day like this.
[time=441] It's because Jesus Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=445] It's the desire of our heart to proclaim his name in every way possible through a church service through the ministry of television.
[time=452] We're looking forward to this entire hour as Dr. Don Jennings comes to speak to us.
[time=458] He is associated with the Baptist World Evangelistic Mission Board and he is in charge of their International Department of Evangelism and Enrichment.
[time=468] He speaks to missionaries and nationals alike holding crusades and meetings in this country and around the globe.
[time=475] For over 20 years he has served as a pastor of a local church and we are looking forward to hearing from him later in our service.
[time=483] But now Lena Peterson comes to sing for us.
[time=486] Lena is a talented musician who's given ability as consecrated to Jesus Christ.
[time=492] We know that even on a day of snow that Christ walks with us wherever we go and Lena sings for us, Christ be with me.
[time=500] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 121 seconds]
[time=631] Christ be before thee, Christ be behind me, King of my heart.
[time=644] Christ be within me, Christ be below me, Christ be above thee,
[time=657] Christ ever too long, Christ be within me, Christ be within me.
[time=684] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=686] I'm glad to welcome my friend Don Krueger back with me today and before you adjust your television set, he's recently back from Florida and is boasting a beautiful tan.
[time=696] Tell us a little bit about your trip, Don.
[time=698] Well, Rick, the trip was just a very, very delightful time.
[time=701] I'm not too sure I liken back into this below zero weather, but we just had a very, very
[time=707] enjoyable time, very relaxing, one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever spent in Florida with 80 degree temperatures and we just really, really enjoyed it very, very much.
[time=716] But it's good to be back.
[time=718] Good to be back where it is minus 12 below zero, wind chill factor, 64.
[time=724] My water is frozen, the driveway is shut off.
[time=727] I hope that we have a few people joining us live today here in our services, but we're so thankful that on these cold mornings, when so many churches aren't able to meet and people can't get out, we're thankful that we can share the message of God's love with you through television.
[time=743] Don just came back from Florida and we want to take a moment to tell you about an opportunity for you to go to Florida.
[time=750] This year, we are sending a group of people who are super sixties, part of our ministry
[time=756] with George and Maryl Antman to Florida.
[time=759] The details are available if you would call the church office at 749-8524, but I have
[time=767] some of the information with me and I'd like to share it with you right now.
[time=771] They will be leaving and going by bus on January 27th and returning February the 9th.
[time=778] So that is just a matter of days away.
[time=781] The cost is $315, which covers every expense except for your meals en route.
[time=788] So your meals down there are paid for, all of your expenses.
[time=791] The only thing you need to have extra money above the $315 is for your meals going to
[time=797] Florida and returning on the trip home.
[time=800] We're going to New Smyrna Beach and we'll be staying at Indian River Lodge.
[time=805] They have been there before as a group of super sixties, Don.
[time=809] You know a little bit about that trip, I believe.
[time=811] Well last year, they came back from their trip from Florida and they were just so excited.
[time=815] It's not just a time for vacation in the middle of the cold weather, but it is a Bible
[time=822] conference experience and there's good Bible teaching and good special music.
[time=826] They have a wonderful, wonderful time and if you'd like to be a part of it, we'd like you to just write into the Bible hour and then we will send you information concerning
[time=836] this.
[time=837] Now it's just a few weeks ahead.
[time=838] As Rick said, I think it's January 27th that begins so that you need to get your reservation
[time=844] in very, very quickly, but you'll really enjoy it right to the Bible hour.
[time=848] Don, it might even be better for them to call today because time is getting short.
[time=853] Tell us here at the Bible hour and ask for the super sixties office, the number is 749-8524.
[time=862] During the beginning of this year, it's a wonderful time to go to a Bible conference with a group of Christians in Florida and because it is the beginning of the year, we have some literature we want to share with you.
[time=873] It is called Timeless Insights.
[time=876] It's a Bible study program that takes you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=881] We've been offering this book Bible study, Timeless Insights in the last few weeks and
[time=888] we're going to be offering it to you through the month of January and it's something that you will enjoy.
[time=893] It's a devotional book and statements from great men like John Calvin or Jonathan Edwards,
[time=899] the preacher and scholar along with biblical truths for every single day.
[time=904] It's a daily devotional guide and I think you might enjoy it.
[time=907] If you'd like it, please write to the Bible hour.
[time=910] Box 15,000-15-000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=918] This is a tremendous little book and I always like a little devotional book along with my regular devotions Rick and I think this is a practical little guide called Timeless Insights
[time=928] and it's from the Word of God.
[time=930] If you want it right to the Bible hour, box 15,000-1500 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and
[time=939] we'll send it right to you.
[time=942] During recent weeks we've heard from many of you and we cannot tell you enough how greatly we appreciate your financial gifts and your words of encouragement.
[time=951] I have some excerpts from a couple of letters that we received in recent days that I'd like to share with you.
[time=957] One person writes and says, "Dear Pastor Rick, we want to help the Bible hour.
[time=963] It has been a blessing as often as we can't get out on Sundays.
[time=967] This is probably one of those Sundays with our blizzard conditions." Then another person writes, "Dear Pastor Rick, we pray that you will be able to continue
[time=977] on the air in South Bend.
[time=980] People in this area need to hear the Word of God.
[time=984] On behalf of all of us here at the Bible hour, we want to thank each one of you who've written a note of encouragement, who've prayed for us personally and privately, each one of you who've sent a financial gift.
[time=996] We're so thankful and appreciative of those gifts.
[time=999] We're not out of the woods yet.
[time=1000] We would appreciate hearing from you today with a financial gift of help.
[time=1005] Come back to us today at the Bible hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1013] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1016] Let me repeat that address one more time.
[time=1019] The Bible hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1029] God bless you and I trust that the music and the message of today will encourage your heart and strengthen your faith in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1064] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=1215] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers, for drawing our attention in a dynamic way to Jesus Christ.
[time=1221] It is our purpose in life to bring praise to His name.
[time=1225] I trust that within your heart there is the desire to sing, "May Jesus Christ be praised."
[time=1231] Again, we know that many of you today could not make it to your church and are joining us for television.
[time=1237] We're delighted to have you on this special snowy occasion joining us here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1244] Let me just encourage you that we would love to know that you're watching and ask you to write into the Bible Hour.
[time=1250] Our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1255] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1259] And I'd like to say just a word of encouragement to those of you who could not make it to church on this snowy morning.
[time=1265] Your church, as well as our church, depends upon the faithfulness of your giving.
[time=1271] And many times when there's a day that a church cannot meet, that church suffers because people do not make that up on the next Sunday.
[time=1279] So regardless of where you go to church, I trust that today you'll be a faithful steward of what God's given to you.
[time=1285] And mail your contribution in to your own church today.
[time=1289] And again, we'd love to hear from you on the Bible Hour.
[time=1292] I hope that you'll make a special effort next Sunday to worship in the House of God.
[time=1297] It was interesting this morning as I listened, and then I heard words from a friend of all the churches that were closing down.
[time=1304] And then Norm Whistler shared with me that on a Christian station, their verse for today was Hebrews 11 or 1025,
[time=1312] which says, "Not to forsake the assembling of yourself together." Then they went into a list of churches that were closing.
[time=1319] Well, just apply that next Sunday and worship in your church that you might assemble together to praise the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1328] We're glad to have the croogers back from vacation.
[time=1330] They've been traveling on the road, and they were on the road about 26 or 27 hours making it back here,
[time=1337] practicing their singing along the way.
[time=1339] And the song that they were going to sing is entitled "I'm Sheltered in the Arms of Jesus." And that was a special blessing to them as they traveled.
[time=1347] Don and Janet Kruger sing to prepare our hearts for God's message today.
[time=1377] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=1576] Thank you Don and Janet for reminding us of the love of God.
[time=1582] Now it's my privilege and pleasure to welcome and introduce to you our speaker for the day Mr. Don Jennings.
[time=1590] He is a part of the team of the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism.
[time=1595] He is the Director of the Department of what they call the International Board of Evangelism and Enrichment.
[time=1602] He has a tremendous ability to communicate the Word of God and it's a delight to welcome him here today.
[time=1609] Dr. Don Jennings.
[time=1615] Thank you Pastor Rick and good morning friends here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and those who are watching by way of television.
[time=1621] On this cold morning I have found here in this Fellowship of Believers a warm-hearted reception.
[time=1628] A warm-hearted church with a heart-warming message.
[time=1632] And I trust that that can be conveyed to those who are beyond this building this morning as well as to those who are within it.
[time=1640] It's a privilege to be back here at Black Hawk for we've had the opportunity many times to share the Word of God from this platform
[time=1648] and missions conferences, Bible conferences, various spatial meetings.
[time=1652] And so it's a joy to be back with you today.
[time=1656] I thank you for your interesting and support of our missionaries.
[time=1661] Missionaries under a number of boards. This is a missionary church with great missionary vision and outreach around the world.
[time=1668] And we thank you for including in your missionary vision the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism
[time=1675] and for contributing to my personal support as I travel around the world ministering the Word of God.
[time=1683] We just returned from a two-month ministry in Papua New Guinea and Australia on December the 14th.
[time=1690] And we leave January 13 for two months again this time in Japan, in Hong Kong, in Red China, in Thailand and in Bangladesh.
[time=1704] And for the congregation here we would solicit your prayers on our behalf and on behalf of those to whom we shall be ministering.
[time=1714] Now we are here gathered in the House of God this morning to focus our attention upon the Word of God.
[time=1720] And I have a message that fits right into our hearts like a hand fits right into a glove.
[time=1728] And you know that is exactly the way the Word of God is. It fits right into our lives.
[time=1735] And so I would like to direct your attention to a passage of Scripture this morning that is so very practical.
[time=1741] So often when we read portions of Scripture we have our heads in the clouds so far that there is no practical application of the truth to our lives.
[time=1755] In other words we are so heavenly minded we are no earthly good.
[time=1759] But I believe you can bring this truth right into your life and make it applicable right in the area in which you live and work.
[time=1768] That is God's truth meets us where the rubber meets the road.
[time=1772] And we want to get right down there where we live and find out whether or not God is involved with us in life.
[time=1780] And I am sure that you will find so many have that God is involved in our lives.
[time=1787] I would direct your attention to Psalm 139 this morning.
[time=1791] And while you are locating that portion of Scripture I would like to pay a political tribute to the Word of God.
[time=1798] I see my Lord in the Bible whenever I chance to look.
[time=1803] He is the theme of the Bible the center and the heart of the book.
[time=1808] He is the rose of Sharon the lily fair.
[time=1811] Whenever I open the Bible the Lord of the Bible is there.
[time=1816] Now he in the books beginning gave the earth its form.
[time=1819] He is the ark of safety to bear the brunt of the storm.
[time=1822] The burning bush of the desert and the budding of Aaron's rod.
[time=1826] Yes the face of my Lord I discover whenever I open the Word of God.
[time=1831] He is the lamb upon Mount Mariah the ladder from earth to sky.
[time=1836] The scarlet cord in the window and the serpent lifted high.
[time=1839] The smitten rock of the desert and the shepherd with staff and crook.
[time=1843] Yes the face of my Lord I discover whenever I open the book.
[time=1847] He is the seed of the woman the Savior virgin born.
[time=1850] He is the son of David whom men rejected with scorn.
[time=1853] The Lord of eternal glory whom John the Apostle saw.
[time=1857] The light of the celestial city the lamb without spot or flaw.
[time=1861] The bridegroom coming at midnight for whom his people look.
[time=1865] Yes whenever I open the Bible I see my Lord in the book.
[time=1871] And it is my desire that we shall see the Lord today in the Word.
[time=1876] The text that I would use for the message this morning to preface this passage in Psalm 139
[time=1884] is found in John's Gospel chapter 20 and verse 27 and a statement made by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1892] He said to Thomas in the upper room behold my hands.
[time=1900] Behold my hands.
[time=1904] And so this morning I would like to talk to you about the hands of God.
[time=1912] In Psalm 139 beginning in verse 1 and reading the first ten verses we read these words.
[time=1942] "Thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me.
[time=1948] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[time=1951] It is high. I cannot attain unto it.
[time=1955] Whether shall I go from my spirit or whether shall I flee from my presence.
[time=1960] If I ascend up into heaven thou art there.
[time=1964] If I make my bed in sheal thou art there.
[time=1967] If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me.
[time=1974] And thy right hand shall hold me." Here in Psalm 139 we have the words hand or hand of God occurring three times.
[time=1988] And to those phrases I would call your attention as we obey the admonition of Lord Jesus Christ who said behold my hands.
[time=2000] A visitor, Dr. English a minister of the word of God to the Philadelphia Art Museum inquired as to where Rodin's famous painting "The Hand of God" was being displayed.
[time=2019] The curator at the museum informed Dr. English that that particular painting "The Hand of God" by Rodin had not arrived at the museum yet.
[time=2029] When the minister was early by a few days he had seen the announcement in the paper that it would be there and he had come prematurely.
[time=2039] He left and some days later received a telephone call at home from the director of the museum and this is what the director said.
[time=2049] Dr. English "The Hand of God" is here.
[time=2054] Dr. English thanked him very courteously and hung up the phone and chuckled to himself.
[time=2061] My friend, in a very real sense, "The Hand of God" is here.
[time=2068] Not the painting, but the person is here.
[time=2072] Jesus Christ said behold my hands.
[time=2077] And he said those words to a doubter, doubting Thomas.
[time=2083] But those words are spoken to all of us.
[time=2087] I think there is much we can learn in studying the hands of God.
[time=2093] The psalmist was excited about the fact that God has hands.
[time=2099] You say what is different about that, nothing different about it.
[time=2103] But that is a truth that should come crashing in upon our spiritual sense of hearing with thunderous tones.
[time=2112] Because if God has hands, can he use them in my life, in my behalf,
[time=2119] in this life, in this work of day world, for his glory and my good?
[time=2126] And the answer is a resounding yes.
[time=2130] God's hands are operative on our behalf.
[time=2136] Now here in these three verses to which I will call your attention in Psalm 139,
[time=2143] we have the statement "The Hand of God." And depending upon the context in which we find this statement, it means different things.
[time=2153] And you find the phrase "The Hand of God" throughout the Bible.
[time=2156] In some places it refers to God's providence, that is his overruling bounty and goodness and favor and help to the children of men.
[time=2167] In other passages it refers to God's presence.
[time=2171] Often we read "The Hand of the Lord was with them" or "with us," referring, of course, to the presence of God.
[time=2178] In other passages, when we find the words "The Hand of God," those words are referring to the power of God.
[time=2186] And truly there is great power in the hands of God.
[time=2190] You find also that in some instances the term "The Hand of God" refers to God's preservation.
[time=2198] In other cases it is referring to God's punishment.
[time=2202] Job said "The Hand of the Lord was heavy upon me." Now with this background, I would like to call your attention to these three occurrences in Psalm 139 where we find the words "The Hand of God" and see what they mean to us personally for today.
[time=2221] First I call your attention to verse 5 of Psalm 139.
[time=2227] And the psalmist says, "His hand is up on me."
[time=2233] His hand is up on me.
[time=2236] And then we read in verse 10, "His hand leads me," and again in verse 10, "His hand holds me." Now would you look at my hand a moment as I illustrate my sermon in a very simple way this morning?
[time=2253] When David said, "God's hand is up on me," this is the posture of God's hand.
[time=2263] God's hand is up on us.
[time=2266] And then David said, "His hand leads me," this is the posture of a leading hand.
[time=2273] And then David said, "His hand holds me." And those three postures or positions of the hand
[time=2285] have a wealth of meaning for those who are the children of God.
[time=2291] And I ask you at the outset this morning, is God's hand upon you?
[time=2296] Is it leading you?
[time=2298] And is it holding you?
[time=2301] Notice first David said, "His hand is up on me." That is his grace for service.
[time=2309] His grace for service.
[time=2312] God places his hands upon various ones of his children for specific mediums of service.
[time=2322] But God places his hand upon all of his children for service in a general way.
[time=2329] I would like to call your attention to the fact that in the book of Ezra, Ezra employs this term, the hand of God, a number of times.
[time=2338] And I would like to call your attention to these occasions.
[time=2342] In Ezra chapter 7 and verse 6, we read that God's hand is upon me,
[time=2348] sending me, Ezra said.
[time=2352] When God places his hand upon us, he may, by that act,
[time=2358] be sending us on a mission for his glory.
[time=2363] That mission may be across the street, it may be across the hallway, it may be upstairs on the next floor in our office building,
[time=2374] it may be in another county or state or another country, but how wonderful it is to have the hand of God upon us commissioning us
[time=2385] to serve him.
[time=2387] We are ambassadors for the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=2392] It is like being knighted by royalty to have the hand of God placed upon us
[time=2399] for any work anywhere in the world.
[time=2403] Again, as Ezra said in Ezra chapter 7 and verse 9, I was sustained or strengthened by the hand of the Lord,
[time=2414] whom God sends, he sustains.
[time=2418] We need not fear going out for God anywhere in this world,
[time=2424] standing up for the Lord anywhere in this world, because we need to remember that the finger of God that points the way is attached to the hand that supplies the need.
[time=2437] And Ezra realized that, and he said the hand of God was upon me,
[time=2443] enabling me, sustaining me, because he had sent me.
[time=2449] And this is the heritage of those upon whom the hand of God has been placed for service.
[time=2456] And I read that, and it encourages me.
[time=2459] And I hope that it encourages you this morning also.
[time=2462] When God places his hand upon us to send us, that same hand is upon us to sustain us in the ministry and in the work.
[time=2471] Furthermore, Ezra said in Ezra chapter 8 and verse 31, that the hand of God was upon him protecting him.
[time=2481] We thank God for the knowledge that whom the Lord loveth,
[time=2487] he chasteneth, and he cherishesth, and he protects.
[time=2494] Lo, I am with you always, even under the end of the Word.
[time=2498] We cannot go anywhere where he is not.
[time=2500] And Ezra realized that the hand that sent him and the hand that sustained him was the hand that was safeguarding him.
[time=2507] How can I be safer anywhere than in the circle of his care?
[time=2512] Thank God that we can claim this same blessing that the psalmist was talking about.
[time=2519] His hand upon me speaks of his grace for service.
[time=2525] And what a wonderful truth that is, and the psalmist exclaimed here in Psalm 139 and verse 5,
[time=2533] after he had comprehended something of this great truth, he said, "Thou hast laid thine hand upon me." And then he adds in verse 6, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[time=2545] It is high. I cannot attain unto it." In other words, he was saying, "Oh God, thou art such a great God." And this truth that you have hands and that those blessed hands, those holy hands,
[time=2561] those powerful hands have been placed upon me.
[time=2566] And he was overwhelmed with this knowledge.
[time=2571] And it ought to bless us today as well.
[time=2575] Here in the 20th century, the same God, the same hand, and he is willing to place that hand upon those who humble themselves before him,
[time=2585] owning him as their God and as their Savior.
[time=2589] In my first pastorate, almost 30 years ago, there was a family, the head of which was a deaf mute.
[time=2598] This man was a unusual man or a gifted and talented man.
[time=2603] He was a telegraph operator on the Norfolk and Western railroad.
[time=2608] Now one might wonder how a deaf mute could be a telegraph operator.
[time=2613] I understand that he was a very, very good one because other noises that ordinarily would affect a hearing person did not bother him.
[time=2624] And so he could just place his hand upon the telegraph key and feel the vibrations
[time=2630] and read the message and pass it on without any interference from outside.
[time=2637] And he had taught his six children and his wife the Morse Code.
[time=2643] And this is what took place every evening when he came home from work in his home.
[time=2650] They had a large round oak table.
[time=2655] And after they had eaten their evening meal, the table was cleared.
[time=2660] Everyone sat around the table with hands on the table is a beautiful sight to behold.
[time=2667] And then the father would reach over to the one nearest him and he would tap out a message
[time=2675] on the hand of the one near him.
[time=2678] And then that message would be passed around the table like that.
[time=2681] And then he would check it as it came back on this hand.
[time=2686] And then he would pass and that's how they communicated as a family.
[time=2690] And it was a sweet Christian family, a tightly nipped family.
[time=2695] Now there is a message in that for a Christian.
[time=2698] God wants us to keep our hands on top of the table, you know, under the table dealings for the children of God.
[time=2707] And God can place his hand upon our hands.
[time=2710] There is a song, the chorus of which goes like this, oh the touch of his hand on mine.
[time=2717] Oh the touch of his hand on mine.
[time=2721] There is grace and power in the trying hour by the touch of his hand on mine.
[time=2734] The Psalmist said, he has placed his hand upon me.
[time=2740] What a privilege, what a blessing.
[time=2743] His hand upon me, that is grace for service.
[time=2748] Then I want you to notice in verse 10 that the Psalmist said, his hand leads me.
[time=2756] His hand upon me for service, his hand leading me, that is guidance for shepherding.
[time=2769] His hand upon me, grace for service.
[time=2772] His hand leading me is guidance for shepherding.
[time=2778] Now I want to be very practical and very simple in relating to you some wonderful thoughts,
[time=2788] at least to me they are wonderful, simple yet sublime about the hand of God as it leads us.
[time=2799] First of all, would you think with me along these lines?
[time=2807] Now if God has my hand, and the Bible says he does, if God has my hand, then he must care.
[time=2821] Now that's simple, but it's overlooked isn't it, it's sublime.
[time=2827] If God has my hand, he must care, and he does care.
[time=2832] First Peter 5-7 reminds us to cast all of our care upon him for he, Carith, for us.
[time=2844] And the next time you get discouraged or snowed under, remember that if God has your hand,
[time=2852] he cares, does Jesus care when my heart is pained too deeply for Mirth and song?
[time=2862] As the burdens press and the cares distress and the day grows weary and long?
[time=2869] Oh yes he cares, I know he cares, his heart is touched with my grief.
[time=2876] Remember he cares, he cares, and because he cares he holds my hand.
[time=2884] But there is a second simple yet sublime thought.
[time=2888] If God has my hand, he cares.
[time=2892] If God has my hand, he must be near.
[time=2899] Would you ever try to hold hands with someone at a distance?
[time=2904] It is very, very difficult, it is impossible to do.
[time=2910] Last year, Mrs. Jennings and I were ministering in a very fine church.
[time=2917] And at noon time the pastor, like in most cases, they do, took us to lunch.
[time=2925] And when we returned from the noon meal, we drove back in the church parking lot,
[time=2931] which was a huge parking lot, to get our vehicle.
[time=2935] And as we entered the church parking lot, the pastor's wife was sitting in the back seat with my wife
[time=2942] and she leaned forward and said to her husband, honey, do you see and called a young boy,
[time=2950] a young girl by name, do you see them there walking across the parking lot?
[time=2954] He said, yes.
[time=2956] Now this is the way they were walking across the parking lot.
[time=2959] The boy had a handkerchief in one hand and she had the other end of it in her hand,
[time=2966] and they were walking across the parking lot like this.
[time=2970] And the wife said to the husband, yes, that's all right, that's permissible,
[time=2976] that's a Bible's length between them.
[time=2981] And I chuckled, but the pastor and his wife didn't.
[time=2986] And I made this remark, when we were dating, I would not have been happy with rules like that
[time=2999] that said we couldn't hold hands.
[time=3002] I said, that's too impersonal.
[time=3004] They didn't laugh at that either.
[time=3009] Now rules are fine.
[time=3012] And if you're inclined to make rules like that, that's your business.
[time=3017] But I am glad that God doesn't hold us apart like that.
[time=3021] He holds our hands.
[time=3024] And David said, his hand leads me.
[time=3028] And it's difficult, if not impossible, to hold hands with someone at a great distance.
[time=3036] I'm glad that God holds my hand because that indicates that he cares
[time=3042] and that indicates that he is near.
[time=3045] Dear, so very dear to God, dearer, I could not be.
[time=3049] For in the person of his Son, I am just as dear as he.
[time=3053] Near, so very near to God.
[time=3056] Nearr I could not be.
[time=3058] For in the person of his Son, I am just as near as he.
[time=3065] And Jeremiah 23, 23 has this question asked by God.
[time=3071] Am I not a God at hand?
[time=3074] God is here, friend.
[time=3077] God is there where you are.
[time=3080] And I hope that God is leading you.
[time=3084] I want you to notice something else.
[time=3087] If God has my hand, he must care.
[time=3093] If God has my hand, I need not fear.
[time=3099] That's self-evident.
[time=3102] We go through life, fearful.
[time=3105] We are afraid of the heights.
[time=3107] We're afraid of the depths.
[time=3108] We're afraid of the light.
[time=3109] We're afraid of the darkness.
[time=3110] We're afraid of the heat.
[time=3111] We're afraid of the cold.
[time=3113] We are fearful about people.
[time=3115] We're fearful about places.
[time=3117] We're fearful about things.
[time=3119] But it's wonderful to know that if God has my hand, I need not fear.
[time=3125] Listen to these words from Isaiah 41 verse 13.
[time=3129] "I, the Lord thy God, will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, fear not, I will help thee."
[time=3138] And then again the Psalmist said, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear."
[time=3146] Now there is no period there.
[time=3148] "I will fear no evil, for thou art with me." And he is.
[time=3154] And we need to reckon upon that.
[time=3156] We need to believe that.
[time=3158] That the God who has hands has our hand.
[time=3163] Consequently, we do not need to fear.
[time=3167] I visited a cemetery in London, England where John Ripon, the great hymn writer,
[time=3173] the great preacher, the predecessor at Spurgeon's Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, is buried.
[time=3180] And he wrote these words that we often sing.
[time=3184] "Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed, for I am thy God, and will still give thee aid.
[time=3191] I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand."
[time=3200] Thank God that he has hands and that that hand can be upon us and that his hand can lead us.
[time=3210] That to me is a great encouragement.
[time=3213] We are leaving on January 13th for Bangladesh.
[time=3217] I've been there before ministering the word of God.
[time=3221] With one of our missionaries, we were hunting one night.
[time=3225] You hunt at night in Bangladesh.
[time=3227] There are so many people, it's the most overcrowded, underfed nation in the world according to the United Nations.
[time=3235] And there are so many people that what game they have does not come out in the daytime.
[time=3239] And so we were hunting in the home of the Bengal tiger at night.
[time=3244] The moon is so bright that you take binoculars.
[time=3247] You stand in the edge of the jungle and look out across the rice patties in the fields and look for the game.
[time=3254] And we were hunting one night, the moon was so bright, we started across a rice paddy.
[time=3259] You could read a newspaper at one o'clock in the morning without any additional light.
[time=3264] We got about the middle of that rice paddy which was larger than a football field.
[time=3269] And suddenly the clouds obscured the moon and it became so dark we could not see where we were walking.
[time=3276] And so I stopped.
[time=3278] Now here is the picture, we have a guide, our missionary, my guide and myself.
[time=3285] I thought they had stopped also but they kept walking.
[time=3289] I didn't hear anything and so in a moment I said, "Are you here?" No answer.
[time=3295] And I found that I was standing in the middle of that rice paddy with no one else around.
[time=3300] And I said, "Oh my, I hope they miss me." And I stood there for some moments and suddenly someone touched me.
[time=3307] And it was my guide who had gotten across the other side and had missed me.
[time=3311] And it come back and he touched my hand.
[time=3315] And he lifted my hand and he placed it on his shoulder as he turned to go in the direction which we were going.
[time=3322] And he placed his right hand on top of his hand as it rested on his shoulder so that here I am now.
[time=3327] My hand is on his shoulder, my gun is over my shoulder and he tugs and we start going across that rice paddy like this.
[time=3336] I'm very unsure, very careful.
[time=3339] But you know we twisted and turned and finally zigzag and got across safely.
[time=3346] We got to the other side and I was very relieved.
[time=3350] And as we walked on through the jungle it seemed as though the Lord said to me, "Son, that is the way it is with you and me." You just stay in touch and stay on the trail.
[time=3364] I've never made a mistake.
[time=3366] I'm too good to be unkind to wise to make mistakes.
[time=3369] I've never made a wrong turn, never lost a case.
[time=3372] I've never gone down.
[time=3374] I'll take you through.
[time=3376] And that's the way it is, friend.
[time=3379] Thank God for the hand that leads us.
[time=3382] He never makes any wrong turns.
[time=3384] Then David uses the phrase one more time in verse 10.
[time=3388] And he said, "His hand holds me." Now his hand upon me, that is his grace for service.
[time=3394] His hand leading me, that is his guidance for shepherding.
[time=3397] And his hand holds me, that is his grasp for security.
[time=3403] Oh, how I thank God for the security we have in the Lord's Jesus Christ.
[time=3409] First of all, there is reassurance in his paternal grasp.
[time=3415] Jesus said in John 10 verse 28, "My sheep hear my voice.
[time=3419] I know them, and they follow me, and I give to them eternal life.
[time=3423] They shall never perish.
[time=3425] Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
[time=3428] Oh, my friend, we are secure in the paternal grasp of God,
[time=3435] hidden in the hollow of his blessed hand.
[time=3437] Never folk can follow.
[time=3439] Never traitors stand.
[time=3441] Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care.
[time=3443] Not a blast of hurry can touch the spirit there.
[time=3447] And then there is renewal in his promised grasp.
[time=3451] Thank God for this promise.
[time=3453] In Isaiah 41-10, "Fear thou not for I am with thee.
[time=3458] I will strengthen thee.
[time=3460] Ye I will help thee.
[time=3462] Ye I will uphold thee by the right hand of my right hand.
[time=3466] Of my righteousness.
[time=3468] Thank God for the promise of renewal in his grasp.
[time=3473] And then there is redemption in his pierced grasp." In John chapter 20 from which we got our text, we read that Jesus said as he held forth his hands, "Nail pierced hands, behold my hands." There is redemption in the pierced grasp of the Lord Jesus Christ.
