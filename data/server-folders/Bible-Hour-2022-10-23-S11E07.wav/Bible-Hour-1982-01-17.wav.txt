[time=57] Welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=60] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=66] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=77] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=83] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prooger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=94] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=103] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=111] To the Bible Hour for our friends who are joining us, by that means welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=120] We've canceled our first service this morning because of the cold, but we've got a crowd of people who've come to worship the Lord this morning.
[time=127] The Bible says they that come to God must worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[time=132] And so we must open up our hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=136] The choir now leads us in that admonition to open up our hearts.
[time=140] Our hearts.
[time=170] We are now in the Holy Spirit.
[time=946] [MUSIC][MUSIC] Truth and beauty and happiness [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] Hell in heaven [MUSIC] Peace and rest [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] Joy and happiness [MUSIC] For he missed you [MUSIC] I've everlasting and free [MUSIC] All that I've found [MUSIC] Is all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] Hell-pumpred healing grace [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] Welcome pardon [MUSIC] A hiding place [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] Love and sunshine [MUSIC] Praise the truth [MUSIC] Oh, feel that [MUSIC] And blessings unfold [MUSIC] Well, for tomorrow [MUSIC] And well, for today [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC] It's all in the name of Jesus [MUSIC]
[time=1196] Only one life so sweet will fast, only what's done for Christ will last.
[time=1216] Only one chance to do is win.
[time=1225] So give to Jesus all your days.
[time=1230] It's the only life that fails, but you will call.
[time=1236] You have won one life, only one life.
[time=1247] It matters only to how much you may own.
[time=1256] The place says you've been for the people you've known.
[time=1265] For it all comes to nothing when placed at His feet.
[time=1274] It's nothing to Jesus, just memories to keep.
[time=1285] Only one life so sweet will fast, only what's done for Christ will last.
[time=1303] Only one chance to do is win.
[time=1311] Give to Jesus all your days.
[time=1315] It's the only life that fails, but you will call.
[time=1321] You have won one life.
[time=1328] Only one life.
[time=1338] The days pass so swiftly, the months come and go.
[time=1349] The years melt away like the new fire and snow.
[time=1359] It's winter to summer, summer to fall.
[time=1369] Our love brings winter, then death comes to come.
[time=1378] Only one life so sweet will fast, only what's done for Christ will last.
[time=1396] Only one chance to do is win.
[time=1404] Give to Jesus all your days.
[time=1408] It's the only life that fails, but you will call.
[time=1414] You have won one life.
[time=1424] Only one life.
[time=1438] [AMEN] Thank you, Marlene.
[time=1444] We appreciate your ministry of music that prepares our hearts to study God's Word that we might know His Son.
[time=1451] To whom to know is to know life eternal.
[time=1455] There's a famous poem out of the history of our country.
[time=1459] It's called The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.
[time=1463] I remember my favorite line out of that, and I was a youth as a student of history, just pictured myself as Paul Revere.
[time=1470] Standing on the opposite side of the river, looking at the Old North Church, and that line in my mind is,
[time=1476] "If by land in two of by sea, and I on the opposite shore shall be."
[time=1482] Paul Revere is perhaps one of the most famous, and rightly so, men of the history of this country.
[time=1488] In his midnight ride to warn the colonies of the British coming, as they marched out of Boston, he gave warning, Paul Revere.
[time=1497] But you know that Paul Revere was not alone in that ride.
[time=1501] As a matter of fact, Paul Revere really didn't do most of it.
[time=1504] He rode off by horse, got word to Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British were coming,
[time=1511] and Paul Revere was arrested before he ever made it to any of the cities to warn the people.
[time=1517] Most of us know Paul Revere.
[time=1519] Probably very, very few of us have ever heard of William Dawes.
[time=1523] And even less of us, the man by the name of Dr. Samuel Prescott.
[time=1529] But it was William Dawes and Samuel Prescott that warned the colonies that the British were coming.
[time=1536] Paul Revere never made it.
[time=1538] You know, it seems that in history, sometimes one person gets the credit of the work of two or three or four people,
[time=1546] and somehow it just doesn't seem fair.
[time=1549] This nation owes a debt of gratitude to men that we will never even hear of in our history books.
[time=1555] You know, the Church of Jesus Christ has the heritage of great men like the Apostle Paul.
[time=1560] But there are others that we've often never even heard their names mentioned.
[time=1566] Everyone who's touched the pages of the Bible knows of the Apostle Paul.
[time=1571] Most people who've spent a little time in the pages of the New Testament know the name Timothy.
[time=1577] And perhaps even a few this morning could give a brief biography of Timothy, but not too much information.
[time=1584] But I would venture to say that relatively few of us even know the name of Apaphroditus, Apaphroditus.
[time=1593] He like William Dawes and Samuel Prescott don't seem to have the notoriety, but he was a true servant of God.
[time=1602] And one of the chief characteristics of being a servant of God, of being triumphant in service, is a selfless nature.
[time=1610] Someone who gets so lost in the needs of others and in serving Jesus Christ, they don't even have time to wonder about themselves.
[time=1621] And whether they'll be remembered, or if someone paid attention, or whether anyone even noticed their labor.
[time=1627] Apaphroditus was such a man.
[time=1630] Timothy and Paul were such people.
[time=1632] They all possess the chief characteristic of a triumphant servant of Jesus Christ, and that is selflessness.
[time=1640] Paul Revere and Paul the Apostle are known.
[time=1645] What about those who labor in this congregation who work in areas that never receive any notoriety?
[time=1652] Are they less important to God?
[time=1654] Oh no. As a matter of fact, the book of Philippians is trying to state a message that the servant is humble.
[time=1663] And when a servant is humble, he trusts in God to lift him up.
[time=1668] Paul has been writing principles about servanthood, principles about the Christian life.
[time=1673] He wrote in chapter 2 verses 1 through 4 about being like-minded, of having a spirit of unity and not a divisive spirit.
[time=1682] In chapter 2 verses 6 through 7, he talked about the Lord Jesus Christ and the principle of being humble and self-effacing.
[time=1691] In the next verses 12 through 16, he talked about conduct and being joyful and having a positive attitude that we don't do anything with murmuring or grumbling or disputing.
[time=1702] Then he wrote about our conduct, and he gave principle after principle after principle.
[time=1709] It would be very easy for us as Christians to come to the length of that list and go, "Good grief.
[time=1715] No one can live by that standard. There isn't anyone." You know something I've learned?
[time=1722] The Bible often drops in illustrations to tell us something.
[time=1727] That is to tell us even though we can't be perfect, that we are to strive.
[time=1731] At this point, after all these principles by the Spirit of God, Paul drops in three people as illustration of those that worked out their salvation, those that were strivers for the Kingdom of God, those who were self-sacrificing, selfless people.
[time=1748] Paul, Timothy, and Epaphroditus.
[time=1751] I invite you to turn with me to Philippians chapter 2 verses 17 through the end of the chapter.
[time=1758] Paul is now applying illustrations.
[time=1762] I love to study history, and people say, "Oh, I can't stand studying all those lists of dates and those boring places."
[time=1770] I think dates and places can be boring, but people can be interesting.
[time=1774] If you study history from the perspective of people, it can come alive.
[time=1779] So Paul wants his principles to come alive so he does it through studying people, verse 17.
[time=1786] Yay, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.
[time=1797] For the same cause also, do you joy and rejoice with me?
[time=1804] But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.
[time=1815] For I have no man like minded who will naturally care for your state.
[time=1822] For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ.
[time=1828] But you know the proof of him, that as a son with the Father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
[time=1837] Him, therefore, I hope to send to you presently as soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
[time=1846] But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
[time=1852] Yet I thought it necessary to send to you a pathroditus, my brother, and companion in labor,
[time=1861] and fellow soldier, your minister and messenger to my need.
[time=1867] For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because you had heard that he had been sick.
[time=1876] For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death, but God had mercy upon him, and not on him only, but on me also,
[time=1886] lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
[time=1890] I send him, therefore, the more eagerly that when you see him again, you may rejoice and that I may be less sorrowful.
[time=1899] Receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all gladness, and hold such in reputation.
[time=1906] Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service towards me.
[time=1915] Three individuals, Paul, Timothy, and the pathroditus, dropped into the illustration of principles.
[time=1922] And I believe what Paul was doing for us is he's giving us an opportunity to look at the lives of people that we might see characteristics of the servant of Jesus Christ,
[time=1932] but that also in seeing those people that we can have confidence that we can serve him today.
[time=1938] I'm often stirred on by examples and illustrations. I often say that I was born about 200 years too late.
[time=1946] When I was a young boy, Johnny Tremaine was my hero.
[time=1950] Maybe you remember that Walt Disney series, Johnny Tremaine, and they used to sing about the Sons of Liberty.
[time=1956] Boy, I would have loved to bend a patriarch. I dumped more tea out of the British boats into the harbor of Boston than all those people put together in my imagination.
[time=1965] I was stirred by the example of a young Johnny Tremaine. Examples can encourage us.
[time=1972] So Paul gives us these three examples. First his own life, because they knew Paul well.
[time=1980] He does that very, very briefly. He only gives himself but one verse.
[time=1986] But then he talks a little bit longer about Timothy, someone that they had known, but he spends most of the time with the pathroditus.
[time=1993] But the life of Paul, three characteristics within Paul's life that make him the servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=2001] The first one is this. He was a totally selfless individual. Notice what he says.
[time=2009] "Yay, yes, if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith."
[time=2015] Paul was sitting in Rome. He was about to be tried by Caesar and there was a very great likelihood that he would be found guilty and put to death.
[time=2027] And Paul said, "I am ready. I am willing to be sacrificed upon the altar of your faith."
[time=2034] You see, it was preaching the gospel to people like the Philippians that merited Paul's trouble and imprisonment.
[time=2043] And he was so selfless that he continually went against the advice of people that said, "Paul, if you keep preaching, if you go to Jerusalem, if you go to this city, they're going to put you in jail and they'll take your life."
[time=2055] But he was such a selfless individual. He won everywhere that God would have him give a word of testimony. He was selfless.
[time=2063] And now he says in prison, "Facing possible execution, I'm ready. If it means that I should be sacrificed, I'm ready."
[time=2073] That word "sacrifice" means a drink offering, a libation. Both within the Book of Leviticus and within Jewish and pagan customs, there was often the sacrifice of wine.
[time=2086] An animal would first be sacrificed, and it would be placed upon the altar.
[time=2091] And then once that animal had been burnt, while the coals were still hot, a cup of wine would be poured as an additional sacrifice, and it would be instantly burn up and taken away in smoke.
[time=2105] Paul says, "I'm ready for my life to be taken up, burned up, completely consumed, my life obliterated. I'll go up and smoke."
[time=2114] Paul said, "I'm ready." He had that selfless nature of a true servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=2122] And then secondly, Paul had a confidence in the face of death. Now that may sound strange that Paul looked forward to death, but if we studied again the first chapter, we'd discover that Paul spoke boldly.
[time=2135] He said, "I'm ready to live. I'm ready to die for me to live is Christ, and to die is game."
[time=2141] Was he some type of demanded masochist who loved pain and thought that death was the ultimate trip?
[time=2147] You know there are existential philosophers that today say there's no meaning to life, and if you want to find meaning to your life, you'll only find it in a terminal experience.
[time=2155] Is that what Paul was saying? Oh no, he was saying that for him to be absent from the body was to be present with the Lord.
[time=2165] And he had confidence. One of the opportunities that is mine, and not necessarily, but sometimes, strangely so, a joyful one, is a funeral.
[time=2177] Each year we probably have within our congregation twenty, twenty-five funerals.
[time=2182] And as I go to those funerals and conduct many of them, you know there's a difference between the death of one who knows Christ and the death of someone where there is not.
[time=2193] That's certainly. You can not only sense it in the going to heaven as that one dies, but you can sense it in every member of the family.
[time=2204] There are those that face death today with confidence. Can you say that you're confident today to die?
[time=2211] That if your life should be taken away today, that you're confident that you know for sure that you're going to heaven?
[time=2218] A nurse was asked during the 1700s if she would be the attending nurse for a gentleman in England who was terminally ill and about to die.
[time=2228] She asked one question. Is the man a Bible-believing Christian? The answer was why yes he is, why do you ask?
[time=2238] And the nurse said, "I attended Voltaire at his death, and for all of the money of Europe, I would not again see an infidel die."
[time=2251] What was the difference between Voltaire and Paul? Was it that one was more intelligent? Paul was a genius, but Voltaire has been called the father of the Renaissance.
[time=2262] He is the great humanist. Was it intelligence? No. Was it success in life? No. Voltaire was an extremely successful man.
[time=2272] It was simply faith in Jesus Christ that Paul could say, "I know whom I have believed it, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him."
[time=2284] Are you like Paul today that you're confident in the face of death? Are you like Voltaire? Will you die in anguish? Will you die in fear?
[time=2294] Today you can have that confidence. You can have that same subtle assurance that the great apostle had if you'll simply today receive the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=2305] If you will invite him in, he gives you the promise of John where he says, "He that believeth on me has everlasting life."
[time=2313] The whole message of the Bible is that you might know that you have eternal life and that you might live with that confidence.
[time=2320] And Paul was not only a selfless man, he was one who died with confidence. Today, if you were to die, are you confident?
[time=2330] Are you 100% certain that you will see heaven? Have you put your faith in Jesus Christ? Oh, I pray that you have.
[time=2339] Then the third thing about the apostle Paul, anticipating his life being taken up as a sacrifice, his attitude was not only confident, but he said, "In that I joy and I rejoice."
[time=2349] He says, "I get happier and happier just at the thought." Paul, thirdly, was undeniably joyful.
[time=2357] If Philippians teaches us anything about success and happiness in life, it is this, that happiness is totally derived apart from our circumstances.
[time=2370] Many of the people in life who have the most miserable lot are indeed the happiest, and some of the people in life who have every occasion to rejoice are the most miserable.
[time=2383] Some of the television shows depict less than a Christian concept of life, and some of the most popular ones now plot a drama, a family struggle, a political struggle, a business struggle.
[time=2396] But there's a message in there if the Christian watches, a message that we can use to the world, and that is this, do you ever see anybody in a soap opera, or a late night drama who is truly happy in life?
[time=2412] No, you do not, because you see, happiness is not political power, it's not business success, it's not sexual experience, happiness in life is to know Christ.
[time=2422] And Paul could say in these circumstances, one, he's about to die, secondly, a paphroditeist who's come to help him nearly dies on him, the Philippians haven't sent the financial help, they had promised to him, and Paul said, "I'm happy, I rejoice."
[time=2439] He was an eternal optimist, I heard a story, you may be familiar with it, about a little boy who was a definition of an optimist.
[time=2447] The story goes that this little boy on Christmas morning on the farm was instructed by his dad to go out to the barn, and there he would find a big pile of manure, and he was disheveled out of the barn.
[time=2459] That little boy ran out there, picked up the shovel on Christmas morning, and began throwing out manure as fast as he could onto the cart with this explanation.
[time=2469] This is great, with this much manure, there's got to be a pony around here somewhere, that's an optimist, that's a young man who was undeniably joyful, he was in a bad circumstance up to his nose, but he was happy, he was joyful, you know, Paul was an optimist.
[time=2488] He wasn't a blind optimist though, I mean people from day to day who simply believed that tomorrow is going to be better, somehow, some way tomorrow is going to be better.
[time=2498] Tomorrow could have been worse for Paul, but his happiness was not dependent upon his situation.
[time=2504] Well here's the illustration of life of Paul, a triumphant servant is someone who is selfless, secondly someone who is confident, and thirdly someone who is joyful.
[time=2517] Would you be a servant of Jesus Christ today, and it begins by denying yourself.
[time=2523] It begins with having confidence in Jesus Christ, and Dwight O. Moody said, and Jerry Falwell reminded us of it this summer, that God never used a discouraged man.
[time=2535] Look back in chapter 2 at verse 14, and take this imperative and apply it to every area of your life that you possibly can. Do all things without murmuring and disputing, don't grumble and complain.
[time=2551] You disqualify yourself from being a joyful servant of Jesus Christ, because a servant of Jesus Christ is one who is confident and who is undeniably joyful, in spite of, not because of the circumstances.
[time=2567] Well Paul doesn't talk about himself a great deal, he wants to say something about Timothy, his young companion, and so he says of Timothy, but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly under you.
[time=2582] And there is one of the keys again of a servant, Timothy represents to us a servant of Jesus Christ in four ways, according to this passage. First he is a set one.
[time=2594] The servant of Jesus Christ must be willing to go wherever Jesus Christ wants him to go, it could be the church service on a cold Sunday morning when it's 15 degrees below zero.
[time=2606] What a delight to see you here this morning, not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together. And so many times when we talk about sending we think, oh, here we go, another, send the missionaries to Africa message.
[time=2618] I believe that's a good thing to do. You know God would have us to serve him today, and we have opportunities to serve, but there must be a willingness.
[time=2628] Timothy had a willingness to be sent. He was willing to be sent by Paul anywhere, and that's literally true. If you had the time to study Corinthians, you would discover that Paul said the same thing to the church of Corinth.
[time=2642] I'm going to send Timothy to help you. If you read Thessalonians you would discover Paul said to the church of Thessalonica, I'm going to send Timothy to help you.
[time=2652] If you read the books of Philemon and Philippians, and if you read the book of Ephesians, you would discover that Timothy was with Paul in prison many times.
[time=2663] If you studied the book of Acts, you would discover that Paul took Timothy with him on his second missionary journey, and the only reason why he wasn't with Paul on his third missionary journey is Paul sent him somewhere else.
[time=2675] Timothy was willing to go. Do you know what the very first word of the great commission is? Go. Matthew, go. Mark, go. John, you shall be sent.
[time=2689] That doesn't necessarily mean we transfer nationalities that we change our location, but it means that there's a willingness of heart that we are going to be aggressive about telling others about Jesus Christ.
[time=2701] Timothy had a willing heart, a servant of Jesus Christ who is triumphant, must be willing.
[time=2707] Then it says, "Not only that Timothy was going to be sent, that I may be of comfort to you when I know of your state, for I have no man who is like minded, no one who has the same spirit as Timothy."
[time=2723] One of the keys to being a servant of Jesus Christ is to have an agreeable spirit. He was like minded. That means he was not divisive.
[time=2734] Back in chapter 2 verses 1 through 4, Paul was writing to people saying, "If there's any comfort in Christ, if there's any love of the brethren, if there's any fellowship of the Spirit, then be of one mind."
[time=2748] Paul was saying, "Here is Timothy. He's like minded. He's of one mind. He is an agreeable person." Agreeableness.
[time=2756] Oh, the sweetness that develops in some Christians as they grow older in the Lord. Some people just grow older, but those that grow older in the Lord, there's a sweetness, an agreeableness that can grow up in their heart.
[time=2770] Some, when they're young, they've got everything figured out. They know how to do everything, and their way is the right way.
[time=2777] But one of the characteristics of a servant of Jesus Christ is a gentle, sweet, agreeableness. Timothy was agreeable. Paul didn't have to argue with him, reason with him, debate with him.
[time=2790] Paul could simply say, "We need you to go," and Timothy would go. He was like minded. He wasn't of a double mind.
[time=2797] Then it says, "For I have no one like minded who will naturally care for your state." He had a pastoral heart.
[time=2807] You know that you can be a pastor without a pastor's heart, and that you can have a pastor's heart without being a pastor.
[time=2815] One of the gifts of the Spirit of God is that of pastoring. You may have that gift.
[time=2823] I know of people in this local church that have the gift of pastoring. They have the tremendous ability to have a well of love that never grows empty.
[time=2835] And they just love people. They care about people, and it's not a duty. Well, somebody needs me, and I really don't want to go, but I've got to keep my...no.
[time=2846] There are people here today that love people, and they naturally care about them. Timothy was one of those people. He just loved people.
[time=2857] You know, one of the joys of being a part of this church is knowing you people. In this past week, we needed to check the membership.
[time=2865] And so Dale Siglin, when I sat down, we went through all the names of people, just making sure it was up to date.
[time=2872] Then when Dale left, I sat down in my office, and I thought, "Lord, you've given us so much in the way of people who serve, and who care, and who labor."
[time=2882] And this church has a great debt because we have a lot of Timothy's people who care.
[time=2889] And a servant of Jesus Christ is one who cares, naturally, about others.
[time=2894] They don't have to be prompted or stimulated or enticed. They naturally care about people.
[time=2901] Do you know that will be the chief need in the future of the church is a natural care for people.
[time=2908] Our society is becoming so impersonal that people are being lost in the shuffle.
[time=2913] But the church of Jesus Christ must be the place where they come and they discover that people care.
[time=2920] A servant of Jesus Christ is someone who naturally cares about others.
[time=2925] And then, fortunately, that chief characteristic comes up again, verse 21.
[time=2930] For all, seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ.
[time=2934] But you know the proof of Timothy. Paul was saying, "Yes, there are those that only care about themselves."
[time=2941] But you know the proof of Timothy, how he labored like a son with a father.
[time=2947] How did they know the proof? Because Timothy had been with Paul at Philippi, and they had seen his conduct and his selfless nature.
[time=2955] Others seek their own, but not Timothy.
[time=2958] He seeks the things of Jesus Christ and how we can serve others.
[time=2963] You know, I'm afraid that Paul may have had two other men in mind.
[time=2967] Two men in the Bible were Christians and who are spoken of with great denunciation.
[time=2973] One is Demas, for he loved this present world.
[time=2979] Paul said, "For all seek their own." Demas sought the things of this world rather than the things of Christ.
[time=2987] For which do you seek?
[time=2989] Then there's a second individual, a leader in a church. His name, diographies, third John.
[time=2997] The Bible describes diographies with this phrase.
[time=3001] He loves to have the preeminence.
[time=3008] He likes his name on everything. He likes his picture on everything.
[time=3013] He likes everyone to know that he had a part of it, seeks his own.
[time=3019] But Timothy was unique in that he had the chief characteristic of a servant of Jesus Christ, a selfless nature.
[time=3028] Then Paul comes to someone who they knew well.
[time=3032] For you see, it was a paphroditus who lived in Philippi and was sent the nearly 800-mile six-week journey from Philippi to Rome to minister to the Apostle Paul.
[time=3044] Now, Paul is writing this letter and he's going to send it back in the hand of a paphroditus.
[time=3052] And he writes to them saying, "You know what a servant of Jesus Christ is, for you know a paphroditus."
[time=3059] And now he's going to describe him as a servant of Jesus Christ with several terms.
[time=3064] The first of which is a brother.
[time=3067] Do you know that when you become a Christian, that you become part of the brotherhood of Jesus Christ?
[time=3073] But that is far different than the brotherhood of militants of the last decade.
[time=3079] There were those in the '60s and the '70s that developed in minorities a militancy and an identification with each other as brother.
[time=3088] But their brotherhood became a divisive, dividing old versus young, rich versus poor, black versus white, haves versus have-nots.
[time=3096] And the term brotherhood became a divisive term.
[time=3100] But in the Scripture, the term brother is a term of endearment, a term of love, of relationship.
[time=3107] Because Jesus Christ had the power to bring a Paul and a paphroditus together.
[time=3112] They were different people.
[time=3114] A paphroditus was a Greek, a Gentile, a barbarian, Paul, a Jew, a Pharisee, an arrogant one
[time=3124] who believed that he was chosen and in Paul's life the most despicable thing that he could think of was association with the Gentiles.
[time=3134] Now how does this Gentile hater and this Gentile come to the place where they call each other brother?
[time=3141] Is Jesus Christ? He can change hearts.
[time=3144] You see, the problem of divisive hearts is not a new problem.
[time=3148] The generation gap is not a new problem.
[time=3151] Cultural gaps are not new problems.
[time=3153] I have a quote to share with you.
[time=3155] A man said this, "Our youth now loves luxury.
[time=3160] They have bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect for older people.
[time=3165] Children nowadays are tyrants.
[time=3168] They no longer rise when their elders enter the room.
[time=3171] They counter-dick their parents, chatter before a company, gobble their food and tyrannize their teachers."
[time=3177] Do you know who said that? It wasn't my dad.
[time=3181] That was Socrates. He lived 400 years before Jesus Christ.
[time=3186] You see, this concept of a divisiveness between youth and adults are black versus white.
[time=3194] It comes from the heart of man. You know that Jesus Christ truly loves all the children of the world.
[time=3199] Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight.
[time=3204] And he would make of all nations one brotherhood.
[time=3207] And the spirit of a servant of Jesus Christ is that he views all men as brothers and he loves each one.
[time=3217] Servant of Jesus Christ calls every Christian brother and has that love.
[time=3222] Secondly, Paul describes him as a companion in labor.
[time=3227] He wasn't afraid to work.
[time=3229] You know, if you want to talk about fellowship, you can do a great deal and you can talk about Coy and Nia fellowship groups and little cell groups.
[time=3238] But you know, to sit around and to pray together is good fellowship.
[time=3243] To worship together is good fellowship.
[time=3245] But you know where true fellowship comes?
[time=3247] It comes when you labor together for Jesus Christ.
[time=3250] The dearest friends that I look back with over the ten years that I've been serving the Lord
[time=3256] are those that we've labored together, labored together.
[time=3260] Servant of Jesus Christ is one who labors.
[time=3263] Then he describes him as a fellow soldier.
[time=3266] Paul was speaking of those Roman military phalanxes.
[time=3270] The Romans devised a new strategy for open field battle.
[time=3274] They developed huge shields that would protect the man's entire body.
[time=3278] Then they would line up side by side, each man with his shield and his left hand, and a spear protruding in his right hand.
[time=3285] And they would line up shoulder to shoulder so their shields would have a solid wall.
[time=3291] Then they would march in cadence singing.
[time=3294] And the enemies of Rome actually fled in battle just at the noise of that solid wall coming.
[time=3300] And Paul said of paphrodite, he says, "March side by side with me." When he speaks of a soldier, he's speaking of suffering, that it costs.
[time=3310] And the servant of Jesus Christ is one who's willing to suffer.
[time=3315] And then, in closing, as our time is near an end, he was a selfless gambler.
[time=3324] A paphrodite was a selfless gambler.
[time=3328] He came to Paul at the risk of his life.
[time=3331] He was nigh unto death that he might meet and minister to the need of the apostle Paul.
[time=3336] And look with me, if you will, at verse 30.
[time=3340] Because for the work of Christ, he was nigh unto death, not regarding, not regarding his life to supply your lack of service to me.
[time=3353] He was reckless. He was what Howard Cosel describes a running back, one who runs with selfless abandonment.
[time=3362] That's with paphroditis. He was one who just denied self and he did what needed to be done selflessly.
[time=3369] But I call him a selfless gambler because that word recklessly refers to a gambler.
[time=3374] It means someone who cast the dye with all the stakes, double or nothing, on one throw.
[time=3382] And paphroditis said I've got one chance to help Paul and he went at it recklessly, totally selflessly.
[time=3389] The servant of Jesus Christ needs to be a selfless gambler, someone who risks all to serve Jesus Christ, someone who demonstrates a selfless spirit.
[time=3401] There are a lot of different characteristics, but there are two that come up every time.
[time=3408] One is the willingness to go. Paul traveled his whole life telling others about Christ.
[time=3417] Timothy was sent from one place to another. A paphroditis journeyed 800 miles being ill.
[time=3423] The servant must first be willing. And then secondly, the common characteristic of all of them is selflessness.
[time=3433] But you know earlier, we spoke about confidence. Confidence not only in life, but in the face of death.
[time=3440] We talked about brotherhood and the bringing the lies together. How does that happen? How does one become a servant of Jesus Christ?
[time=3448] It happens when an individual by faith bows their heart and says, "Lord Jesus Christ, I believe you are my Savior.
[time=3456] I want you to come into my heart. I invite you to come in." Won't you make that prayer today? Oh, if you understand anything of the Word of God, know that Jesus Christ must come into your heart.
[time=3469] You can have the confidence of eternal life. Let's pray together.
