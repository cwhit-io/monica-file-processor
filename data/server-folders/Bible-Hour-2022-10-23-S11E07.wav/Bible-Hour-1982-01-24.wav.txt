[time=91] - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=94] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the word of God.
[time=101] They're preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=112] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=117] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=128] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour Musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=137] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=148] We welcome our friends for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=152] We know that during these cold, snowy, icy mornings that we have a few more friends watching the Bible Hour than usual, and we were preempted last week here in Fort Wayne because of a special telethon.
[time=163] And it's great for us to have this opportunity to share with our friends through television, the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[time=170] We begin this morning with our choir singing for us, and they're going to sing under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger, "What Grace Is This?" (piano music playing)
[time=205] (singing in foreign language) [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=264] (piano music playing) [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=384] - Thank you, Choir, we sing of Grace today because it is the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that has given us eternal life.
[time=392] And we meet this morning with confidence that God cares for us.
[time=396] And when you're confident towards God, then you can sing notes of praise.
[time=401] You can praise him with your heart.
[time=402] You can render to him your highest praise.
[time=405] David Miller comes to sing for us a song with that exact same title, my highest name is Jesus Christ.
[time=412] My highest praise, David Miller.
[time=415] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=561] - Hello and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=579] I look forward during our service to these few moments just to talk with our friends who are part of our television audience.
[time=586] Don Krueger is with me this morning.
[time=588] Hello, Don, how are you?
[time=589] - I'm fine, Rick, how are you?
[time=590] - Good, I'm doing well too.
[time=592] This is the third Sunday in a row when the temperature's been below zero.
[time=597] The winds have been blowing.
[time=599] Right now our parking lot would make one of the best ice skating arenas in the city, I'm sure.
[time=604] - Yesterday they were skating over on the parking lot across the street.
[time=607] - Is that right?
[time=608] - Well that gives you an idea just about what the weather's like here.
[time=612] It is cold, it is windy and it is icy.
[time=616] During the day of Friday and Saturday it warmed up and all the snow melded turned in the water and then it hit those sub-zero temperatures and it's ice again.
[time=625] Because of that I'm sure that many people weren't able to get to church today and have chosen to stay home where it's warm and safe and are worshiping with us this morning on the Bible Hour.
[time=636] - We welcome you particularly if this is your first exposure to the Bible Hour.
[time=641] My name is Rick Hawks and I'm one of the pastors of our church, Don Kruger is another pastor.
[time=647] His responsibility is in the area of music.
[time=649] What should our people be looking forward to today in the ministry of music, Don?
[time=654] - Well we've just listened to the choir sing and the Peter Sings are singing Al and Lena and then Lena Peterson is going to sing a solo along with Dave Miller singing a solo also.
[time=665] Well that's something that we are looking forward to and this morning I'm gonna have an opportunity to open up God's Word and to speak to you about joy.
[time=674] You know there are many counterfeits in life.
[time=676] Some people try to substitute a temporary happiness for true joy in their heart.
[time=683] I'm looking forward today to telling you God's plan for our joyful rejoicing life.
[time=688] But right now we have some other things that we'd like to share with you.
[time=691] One of those is a daily devotional book called Timeless Insights.
[time=695] - Pastor Rick this is a tremendous little book.
[time=697] It's not just another devotional book.
[time=700] It stands out as one of the best I think.
[time=703] We were using it just recently in our staff meeting.
[time=707] We had a staff retreat where we went away for a couple of days of planning and this is a tremendous little book.
[time=711] We enjoyed it each morning we looked at it.
[time=714] Some of the things it has is a scripture verse for every day and then an explanation of that scripture verse and then some tremendous thoughts by some men who have gone on before or men who know the word of God some tremendous theologians like for instance.
[time=728] This one contains the scripture verse in the book of Acts, Acts 1-8.
[time=734] You shall receive power and you shall be witnesses unto me.
[time=737] And then a little nugget from G. Campbell Morgan who is a tremendous man speaking about the fact that a missionary is one who tells the gospel wherever he is not just on a foreign field.
[time=749] And then there's a little response for the believer to have in his own heart and life as he reads the word of God.
[time=757] It's a tremendous little book.
[time=758] We offer this to you and we'd love for you to write in.
[time=761] If you do write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, 1-5-0-0-0, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 4-6-8-1-5 and we'll be glad to send you your copy of Timeless Insights.
[time=775] It's a tremendous little devotional book we recommend it highly.
[time=779] Don, one of the things that I enjoy about Timeless Insights is its systematic nature.
[time=784] I remember as a new Christian several years ago that when I came to opening God's Word to study it for daily devotional, I just kind of flopped the Bible open and read till something caught my eye.
[time=795] But this little booklet takes you through the New Testament chapter by chapter.
[time=799] In the whole year, you'll cover the entire New Testament.
[time=802] It's a great systematic Bible study.
[time=805] We'd like to send it to you.
[time=807] Why don't you write to us today?
[time=809] Jot down this address, the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=816] The zip code is 4-6-8-1-5.
[time=819] Down over recent weeks, we've received countless letters of encouragement and support for the Bible hour.
[time=825] Many people have helped us financially, but I want to talk to you about a different financial problem today.
[time=830] And it's not ours, it's your churches.
[time=833] You know, when your church misses services because of the weather, are they?
[time=838] Don't have a good attendance.
[time=839] Hundreds of people don't come to church.
[time=842] And when they don't come to church, many of them are not faithful in their giving.
[time=846] Your local church needs your attendance and they need your support.
[time=850] Wherever you go to church, please make every effort to worship there whenever you can and when you can't.
[time=857] Don't let that affect your giving.
[time=859] Send today to your local church, your place of worship, your love, gift and offering that they might be financially stable in the days ahead.
[time=867] I know that would be a tremendous encouragement to your pastor.
[time=871] Thank you again for joining us today.
[time=873] Don and I are looking forward to sharing the rest of the service with you, the music and the message from God's Word.
[time=879] We want to thank a very special person today and that is Martha Flack.
[time=884] She has sponsored the Bible hour today.
[time=887] She watches it on WPTA channel 21 here in Fort Wayne and she is sponsoring the Bible hour in memory of her husband, Donald J. Flack.
[time=897] Thank you all, God bless you and have a great day.
[time=900] (soft music)
[time=924] [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=1061] (soft music) - Thank you, Al and Lenna.
[time=1068] To sing about prayer and the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ that he would hear our prayer, but also that we would hear him, that we'd be sensitive to him.
[time=1077] How does an individual come to the place where they have that relationship with Jesus Christ?
[time=1082] How can a sinner be made right in God's eyes and have the right to pray to him?
[time=1087] Lenna sings for us now, "Since I Have Been Made Right." (soft music)
[time=1095] [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=1244] - Thank you, Lana.
[time=1252] I trust this morning that the spirit of Jesus Christ has filled you with his love.
[time=1258] Paul listed nine things that represent the fact that Jesus Christ is alive in our heart.
[time=1264] He called them the fruit of the spirit and the first was love.
[time=1269] And the second was joy.
[time=1272] And the third piece.
[time=1274] Love, joy, and peace.
[time=1277] In recent weeks we've been studying together through the Book of Philippians.
[time=1281] And that book is a book that talks a great deal about love and even more of joy.
[time=1287] As a matter of fact, that word, joy, or one form or another of it occurs, 18 different times in the short spans of 104 verses.
[time=1296] God's word has a message for you and I that he loves us and he desires that our lives might be joyful.
[time=1305] As a matter of fact, in 1st John, the fourth chapter, God said, "These things have I written unto you "that your joy may be full." So many times we misunderstand God's plan for our life.
[time=1319] So many think that God desires to take something away from our life to rob us of happiness, to subtract everything that is of value and to leave us empty.
[time=1329] When the truth is, Jesus said, "I'm come "that you might have life and that you might have it "more abundantly." Does that mean that God therefore is going to take control of the circumstances of life and he's gonna so range it that everything just goes well?
[time=1345] That means that if I'm a Christian then I don't have to worry about unemployment.
[time=1349] No, I don't believe so.
[time=1351] We could have some testimonies this morning that that's not exactly the plan.
[time=1355] Does that mean that everything is going to fit into place?
[time=1359] No, it doesn't.
[time=1360] What it does mean is that God can give to your life confidence and fulfillment in spite of those circumstances.
[time=1366] I invite you to continue your study with us in the book of Philippians by turning to Philippians chapter three.
[time=1373] We've been studying Philippians for months and I don't even have to look.
[time=1377] My Bible just flops open and I hope yours opens easily because of much use of study in the word of God.
[time=1385] Philippians the third chapter and today we'll be studying verses one through three.
[time=1390] I would like to read them for you at this time.
[time=1393] Finally, my brother, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1398] To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not grievous, but for you, it is safe.
[time=1407] Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of concision, for we are all the circumcision who worship God in spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.
[time=1422] Let's pray together.
[time=1424] Our Father, it is the desire of our heart this morning that you would speak to us through your word.
[time=1429] We might know you and we might know your will for our lives.
[time=1433] For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1436] There are counterfeits in life.
[time=1441] I remember being about 14 or 15 years old and our family of four went down to a local ice cream stand.
[time=1447] My dad bought some ice cream and some milkshakes and he gave the waitress a $20 bill.
[time=1452] She accepted that as a good $20 bill.
[time=1455] Gave him his change, you might not get much change today, but back then you got quite a bit of change.
[time=1460] She gave him the change back and we went home and never thought more about it till the police came the next day.
[time=1466] Wanted to know where my father got that $20 bill.
[time=1469] It was a counterfeit.
[time=1471] He had received it, believing it to be a valid $20 bill.
[time=1475] He had passed it along believing that it was a genuine $20 bill.
[time=1480] It was received as a genuine $20 bill by a waitress.
[time=1486] But the truth of the matter is it was counterfeit.
[time=1489] It was not real and the test of time proved it.
[time=1494] Do you know that there are counterfeits that you and I often buy today believing they're genuine?
[time=1500] Paul is speaking about the genuine nature of the Christian and that it is joyful.
[time=1506] The counterfeit is happiness.
[time=1509] So many today believe that because I am happy in life, therefore I have the joy that the Bible speaks of.
[time=1516] Others believe that they are going to gain happiness not through Jesus Christ, but through success in different areas of their life.
[time=1524] Happiness is a counterfeit to joy.
[time=1527] Happiness is experience and circumstantially related.
[time=1532] That is that if things go well in my life, if my business is successful and my marriage is successful, then I am happy.
[time=1541] However, that happiness goes when the circumstances become adverse.
[time=1546] Joy, the true gift of the spirit, is that which endures all time, the proof being the life of the Apostle Paul.
[time=1553] He's in prison.
[time=1555] He is without finances.
[time=1556] He has basically been left alone and he writes a great letter of encouragement and of joy.
[time=1563] Confidence and joy.
[time=1565] Well, our world has other counterfeits.
[time=1567] God speaks of love and the counterfeit in our culture is sex.
[time=1572] Society says that if you're lonely, if you're devoid of love, then what you need to do is reach out and become involved in the sexual experience.
[time=1579] And then through sex, you'll find fulfillment.
[time=1581] It's a counterfeit.
[time=1583] It'll rob you of your self-concept.
[time=1585] It'll depreciate you in the eyes of your friends.
[time=1588] It'll leave you empty.
[time=1589] It's a counterfeit.
[time=1590] Sex is not love.
[time=1592] God promises peace in his word, but our society comes with a counterfeit.
[time=1597] Security.
[time=1598] That is, if I have a good job and if I have money in the bank and I have savings and I've got most of my mortgage paid off and my car's running okay and I know that my family's doing all right, I'm secure.
[time=1609] And when that security can be robbed in the moment, there were those who were part of this congregation that a year ago were secure.
[time=1618] And today, they are not.
[time=1620] Peace is something that transcends even the insecurities of life.
[time=1626] So when we speak about values in the Word of God, it's important that we're not deceived and that we don't buy a counterfeit.
[time=1634] Now Paul starts off as most of my seminary professors did.
[time=1638] He starts off chapter three by saying, finally, the reason why I say that he's like my seminary professors, Paul is nowhere near to done.
[time=1645] He's only halfway through.
[time=1648] Somehow our teachers, and you probably remember them, say, I just wanna share with you one more thing and then 10 more things follow.
[time=1655] Paul's not nearly done.
[time=1657] Perhaps what he's saying finally of final importance or chief importance is this, to rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1665] If you wanna look back, look back, if you will, verse 17.
[time=1668] Paul says, yes, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.
[time=1677] Paul himself is possessing this joy and what he's saying to them is I want you to be joyful and I want you to be happy, so I know you.
[time=1687] You're saying, oh yeah, but Paul didn't know about my husband.
[time=1691] If he had to live with my husband, he wouldn't have been so confident.
[time=1696] Paul said, if you'd known the guy I worked for, you knew my boss and you wouldn't even begin to talk about joy.
[time=1702] Don't know that Paul necessarily knew your husband or knew your boss, but the God who inspired Paul, he knows your husband, knows your boss.
[time=1713] You know what he did?
[time=1714] He wrote a statement, "Rejoice in the Lord." He didn't write it as a suggestion.
[time=1718] God didn't say, my therapy for your miserableness is that you'd be happy, that you'd be joyful.
[time=1724] Wasn't a recommendation.
[time=1726] Actually, men and women, God has commanded us to be joyful.
[time=1730] Now this particular passage is gonna focus in on how to be joyful or at least to protect that joyfulness.
[time=1736] But this morning, I'd like to look at a few other concepts to help prepare you.
[time=1740] You may be asking today, then how can I know the joy you're speaking of?
[time=1745] First of all, to be joyful, you must be a Christian.
[time=1750] Now let me back up and say this.
[time=1752] I believe today that you can be genuinely happy and not be a Christian.
[time=1756] I know that's a fact.
[time=1757] I have friends, I can remember in my own life.
[time=1760] Before I came to Christ, I was happy.
[time=1762] But I wanna point out there's a difference between days of happiness and the genuine joy that Jesus Christ offers.
[time=1769] A joy that transcends the trials of life.
[time=1773] You must be a Christian to experience that joy.
[time=1775] Let me explain to you why.
[time=1777] In the 15th chapter of the Gospel of John, Jesus takes an illustration.
[time=1783] The illustration is that of the vine and the branches.
[time=1788] What he is saying is just as there's a master vine in the great harbor and branches shoot off and from those branches come forth fruit.
[time=1797] He's saying that I am the eternal vine and you are my branches.
[time=1800] And when you are drawing your life from me, then you'll produce fruit.
[time=1805] What is that fruit?
[time=1807] Paul tells us love, joy, peace, patience, long suffering, goodness, meatness, gentleness, faith, self-control.
[time=1816] How can we have joy?
[time=1817] We've gotta be drawing our life from the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1821] He is the vine, we are the branches.
[time=1824] Now many of you know a lot more about cars than you know about farming.
[time=1830] So let me just take this illustration.
[time=1832] If you want your car to run, then you have to have a fuel line going to that car.
[time=1838] And if your engine is detached from your fuel line, you can try to start it and it will not start because it is not drawing its energy in the spiritual sense, its life from the source.
[time=1850] The source is Jesus Christ.
[time=1852] And we draw our life from him.
[time=1854] And when we draw eternal life from him, the birthright, the genuine birthright of a Christian is joy.
[time=1862] You know, one of the things that I am so encouraged by is when I talk to many of you.
[time=1867] And I know of your circumstances and I hurt for you.
[time=1871] My heart actually anguishes for many today who've lost jobs without really any hope of regaining one.
[time=1878] Others whose spouses have ignored them, perhaps even leaving them.
[time=1882] And I know of your circumstances, but yet you still have confidence in God.
[time=1888] You still have joy because God is your source of joy and he'll give you the strength and the confidence to transcend your circumstances.
[time=1897] But you cannot know joy without being a Christian.
[time=1900] There are two groups of people today that may be listening and who are not Christians.
[time=1906] There are those today and I'm sure that there are some in this auditorium.
[time=1909] We welcome you, we thank you for coming.
[time=1912] But you've made a decision in your life that you are not going to accept Jesus Christ.
[time=1916] You've rejected him, you do not acknowledge him as Lord and Savior, but you're trying to duplicate.
[time=1923] You're trying to counterfeit copy the joy of a Christian by happiness.
[time=1929] Men and women, I'm confident that you may find some temporary happiness.
[time=1933] But I also know that happiness has the wings of a bird and the fleet of a gazelle.
[time=1939] And as quickly as it comes, it goes.
[time=1942] The joy of Jesus Christ is that which sustains the believer amidst the worst of opportunities.
[time=1949] But it only comes when you receive Christ.
[time=1951] But there would be a second group.
[time=1953] There would be those today that believe they are Christians and are not.
[time=1957] They're trusting in the fact that they've come to church this morning.
[time=1960] You may feel like you came today because that would please God.
[time=1964] And he would be so happy that he had looked down upon your life with favor and he would say to you, well done enter into my kingdom because you go to church.
[time=1972] Men and women, that's not true.
[time=1973] Now we want you to come.
[time=1974] We're glad you're here.
[time=1976] But coming to this church service will not gain you entrance into heaven.
[time=1981] Nor will it gain you the joy that the Bible speaks of.
[time=1984] How does a person have the joy?
[time=1986] The Bible says by coming to Jesus Christ and receiving him into a heart.
[time=1991] Is he gonna make life better?
[time=1992] Not externally, but internally, he will.
[time=1996] He said, "I am come that you might have life "and that you might have it more abundantly." Jesus said, "I didn't come to rob you of joy.
[time=2004] "I didn't rob you.
[time=2005] "I came to give eternal life and abundant life." Then to be joyful, first of all, you must be a Christian.
[time=2014] Secondly, to be joyful, you must be an obedient Christian.
[time=2018] I am amazed at the number of people that think that they can circumvent God's clear will and arrive at the same perspective as joy as if they had obeyed him their whole life through.
[time=2033] Let me turn your attention and I'll ask you to flip back in your Bibles to John chapter 15.
[time=2039] John chapter 15 verses 10 and 11.
[time=2044] This is the passage I just referenced, the vine and the branches, John 15 verses 10 and 11.
[time=2053] If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love.
[time=2063] These things have I spoken unto you that your joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full.
[time=2071] It's not only imperative to have the joy of knowing Christ by believing in him and being a Christian, but you must be an obedient Christian.
[time=2079] Let me go back to my poor illustration of a car.
[time=2082] If that fuel line is detached, then there is no energy.
[time=2085] There is no life the car cannot run.
[time=2088] But suppose you are a Christian and your fuel line is attached.
[time=2092] It can become clogged.
[time=2095] In these days, it can become frozen.
[time=2098] Now, fuel line frees up.
[time=2100] By the way, most of those things you dump in, I found don't work in my car.
[time=2103] If you've ever had fuel line frees up, are an engine blocked or a filter clogged, you discover that even though you have gas in the tank and you have a line and it's all plugged together that it doesn't run because there's blockage.
[time=2117] Men and women, you may be plugged into Jesus Christ.
[time=2120] There may be a line attached.
[time=2121] You may sincerely have received him, but there's blockage that is disobedience to him and sin.
[time=2127] Therefore, you cannot draw the joy from Jesus Christ that he offers to you.
[time=2133] Many of the Psalms, most of them were written by David.
[time=2137] Most of them were written by David when he is being pursued and hounded by King Saul.
[time=2143] Out of anger, out of vengeance, probably out of mental disorder, Saul seeks to take David's life.
[time=2150] Most of it over jealousy.
[time=2152] For once David had killed Goliath, the attention went from Saul onto the little shepherd boy David and the woman began to sing a new song.
[time=2160] They sang, "Saul has slain his thousands." But David is 10,000 and the jealous angry man pursues the life of David.
[time=2170] David flees to the wilderness.
[time=2171] He's alone, living in a cave and looks out.
[time=2176] And he sees his enemy, King Saul, with a whole army compassed about against him.
[time=2181] He writes that Psalm with great confidence.
[time=2186] Psalm 27, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom then shall I fear?
[time=2193] The Lord is the strength of my life of what shall I be afraid." Now how can a man write with such confidence?
[time=2200] How can he write with such certainty and joyful expectation?
[time=2204] It's because he walked with God himself and David was the apple of God's eye.
[time=2209] And you see, even the circumstances of being pursued under death could not rob David of his joy or of his confidence.
[time=2217] There's another psalm that David wrote, "Saul 51." Psalm 51 is not one of confidence.
[time=2225] It's not one of joyful expectation.
[time=2228] It's one of pain.
[time=2229] It's one of a broken relationship.
[time=2233] It's one where sin had clogged the fuel line and the joy was being robbed.
[time=2240] Psalm 51, "David said and sinned did my mother conceived me, and iniquity was I born." And he laments before God the fact that he is a sinner.
[time=2250] And he cries out to God.
[time=2253] In verse 12, he says, "Oh God, return unto me the joy of my salvation." Can you be a believer today in sin?
[time=2260] Yes, you can.
[time=2262] Can you be a believer today in living apart from Jesus Christ?
[time=2267] Yes, you can.
[time=2269] Sin, disobedience bars us from the joy of knowing Jesus Christ.
[time=2275] You see, you would think that because Jesus Christ gives joy in eternal life, that Christians would be the most joyful people on the earth.
[time=2282] Many of you look like you've overdosed on prunes today.
[time=2286] Not a whole lot of joy every Sunday morning in this place.
[time=2290] Why is that?
[time=2291] Because you and I struggle with sin.
[time=2293] And our sin robs us of the joy of knowing Jesus Christ.
[time=2298] But David wrote a Psalm that gives to us a promise.
[time=2302] Psalm 1, "Blessed." That word, "Blessed" comes from the Latin, "Vietos," which means to be happy or to be joyful.
[time=2308] So you can say, "Joyful." Psalm 1, "Joyful is the man who walketh not in the counselly and godly, or siteth in the seat of the scornful, or standeth in the way of the sinner.
[time=2320] Happy is the man who is not disobedient.
[time=2322] But in contrast, verse two, "His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law that he meditate day and night.
[time=2331] And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, which bring forth fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not wither.
[time=2338] And whatsoever he doth shall prosper." Joy comes first of all to be joyful.
[time=2345] You must know Jesus Christ.
[time=2346] Whom to know is to know life eternal.
[time=2349] Secondly, we must be walking in obedience with him.
[time=2353] One poet has written these words, "O how tedious and tasteless the hours, and Jesus no longer I see.
[time=2364] Sweet song, sweet music, sweet flowers.
[time=2367] You have lost all their sweetness to me." Perhaps this morning you sit back and you look at some days of your life as a believer, and you look back at the excitement and the genuine joy that you used to have.
[time=2381] And you can remember your enthusiasm and your vivacious, gregarious, bubbling nature, losing forth with the love of Christ.
[time=2390] And somehow, you're like a loaf of bread that's been exposed in the open air for two days.
[time=2395] You're dry, crusty, and your life seems to crumble in the hands of God.
[time=2402] Oh how tasteless and tedious the hours, when Jesus no longer I see.
[time=2408] No music, no song, no flowers.
[time=2411] They have no joy for me.
[time=2414] Has something robbed you of your joy?
[time=2417] Did you break your relationship with Jesus Christ by sin?
[time=2421] Oh, then pray as David prayed.
[time=2422] Oh God, return unto me the joy of my salvation.
[time=2427] Today we've said if you would be joyful, then you must be a Christian.
[time=2431] Secondly, if you would be joyful, you must be an obedient Christian.
[time=2435] Now we come back to Philippians chapter three, verses one through three, which tells this.
[time=2441] If you would be joyful today, you must be a free Christian.
[time=2446] You must be free today.
[time=2448] You must be free.
[time=2450] Paul encountered a group of people that were obstacles, that were obstinate, and that actually hounded him and attracted him from his ministry, that actually tried to take his life.
[time=2462] But worse than all that, the Paul, they sought to pervert those that he had won to Christ by placing them in bondage and robbing them of their freedom.
[time=2474] He speaks of them in verse two.
[time=2477] Beware of dogs.
[time=2480] Beware of evil workers.
[time=2483] Beware of concision.
[time=2486] Three different terms actually referring to one single group of people.
[time=2493] Acts tells us of these people.
[time=2496] You see, as Paul went from point to point in his missionary journeys, there was a group of men that followed him and pursued him with two goals in mind.
[time=2506] Goal number one to destroy the apostle Paul, and they nearly succeeded.
[time=2511] They got hold of him at Lystra, and they drug him outside of the city, and there they stoned him, and they stoned him till they believed that he was dead.
[time=2522] But he was not dead, and God raised him up to be an apostle and to preach the gospel.
[time=2529] But these men had a second goal, bent more than just on the destruction of Paul, bent on the perverting of those that he had won to Christ.
[time=2538] And what they did, they would move in.
[time=2540] Paul would enter a city.
[time=2541] Maybe that city would be Iconium.
[time=2543] And their Paul would lead people to Christ, and he would lead for another city, Derby.
[time=2548] They would come into Iconium.
[time=2550] They would instruct the people that what Paul said was only partially accurate, and that they must become Jews.
[time=2560] That they had to obey the law, that they had to keep God's ceremonial law, that if they wanted to please God, they had to perform sacrifices.
[time=2568] If there were going to be God's people, they had to be circumcised.
[time=2570] If they were going to gain any favor from God, they had to obey the feast days.
[time=2574] They said, you have to be under the law.
[time=2579] God said, beware.
[time=2582] Beware of dogs.
[time=2584] And when I think of a dog, I think of a cute little house pet, maybe a gapping French poodle, a little chihuahua.
[time=2591] You know this little barking little nuisance that we often treat better than our children.
[time=2596] When the Bible speaks of dogs, it's not talking about this little house pet.
[time=2601] It's talking about a vicious, dangerous animal.
[time=2606] Think of a pack of wolves when you think of dogs in the Bible.
[time=2609] For in the city of Jerusalem, there were packs of dogs that roamed the streets.
[time=2614] To the south of the city, there was a valley called the Valley of Henna.
[time=2619] You have heard the expression, "Gahenna Hellfire." That refers to that valley where all the trash and the refuge of the city was dumped, and there was a continual fire burning that refuge.
[time=2630] These dogs would run through the valley of Henna, eating the garbage.
[time=2635] But it wasn't safe to take the garbage down there.
[time=2638] You had to go armed because these dogs would attack people and eat them.
[time=2643] God's speaking when he speaks of dogs of a vicious animal, a devouring animal.
[time=2649] God calls those that would put Christians into bondage under the law of dogs.
[time=2654] The term "dog" is the most significant term of derision in the Old Testament.
[time=2660] Jesus was portrayed in prophecy, hanging on the cross in Psalm 22.
[time=2666] And they said dogs had compassed about him, referring to the most debased wicked people.
[time=2672] Isaiah 56 tells us of that same expression, the dogs that came after the Messiah.
[time=2678] Job lamented the dogs that tormented him coming after his sores, not that they simply licked his sores, but they were actually waiting like a vulture for him to die, that he might eat his flesh.
[time=2691] And God says that those who would place Christians under bondage are dogs.
[time=2697] He said, "Beware of those dogs." He also said, "Beware of evil workers." Now what Paul was doing is he is in every one of these expressions, turning the Jews own terminology against them, and not the Jewish nation, not the Jewish religion, those who were simply of the Jewish faith that were perverting the gospel.
[time=2717] First of all, the Jews called the Gentiles dogs.
[time=2721] Now Paul turns the table and says, "No, you're the dog.
[time=2724] You're like a raving, mad, rabby-full dog pursuing what I've left behind." Secondly, he calls them evil workers.
[time=2733] They believed that they were going to have them because they were good workers.
[time=2737] They thought that they merited God's favor because they kept the Sabbath.
[time=2741] They believed that they pleased the Father because they sacrificed animals, and they believed by their obedience to the ceremonial law that God would be well-pleased with them for their good works.
[time=2754] The truth of the matter is that their good works were actually evil works.
[time=2758] They were not only not bringing themselves to God, they were pushing themselves further and further away from God.
[time=2766] The third thing he describes them, he says, "Beware of concision." The word "concision" and "circumcision" are very similar in the language of the Bible.
[time=2776] One refers, however, "concision" to bodily mutilation.
[time=2782] And Paul said, "You're not the circumcision of God.
[time=2784] You're the mutilated." And he takes those three plays on words to turn around and to say, "Beware of legalizers." Beware of those who would rob you of your joy by adding to the Word of God.
[time=2798] And then he begins to say, "What then is the joyful Christian?" Not only who are we to be aware of, but what are we to be?
[time=2807] He says this, verse three, "For we are the circumcision.
[time=2811] We are the true believers who," and three descriptions, first of all, worship God in spirit.
[time=2819] Do you know that these people did not worship God in spirit.
[time=2822] They worshiped Him in form.
[time=2824] They were very concerned about which place was the right place to worship.
[time=2830] There were those of the Samaritans that said, "We worship in Mount Gerizim." The Jew said, "No, you worship in Mount Zion.
[time=2837] You worship in Jerusalem." They were not only concerned about the location.
[time=2841] Their concern about the form was that it had to be at an exact right day.
[time=2847] You had to go, and they meticulously guarded the Sabbath day.
[time=2851] And there were those that would not worship any day, except for the Sabbath day, sundown Friday, the sundown Saturday.
[time=2858] They were so concerned about the form and the sacrifices and the libations be performed precisely in exactly so.
[time=2868] Jesus encountered one such person, a woman of Saikar, a woman of ill-repute, and a well.
[time=2875] And she begins to ask questions about the form and how ought we to worship and where should we worship?
[time=2880] And Jesus says this, "God is spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth." Do you know today that God's not nearly concerned about whether you're here on Sunday as He is concerned that your heart and your spirit beat after Him?
[time=2897] And if you worship Him, oh, it's good to worship in the house of the Lord.
[time=2901] The Scripture says not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.
[time=2905] Men and women, we worship not on the day, not in the form.
[time=2910] We worship in spirit.
[time=2912] Those whose hearts please God.
[time=2915] Secondly, those who rejoice in Christ Jesus, that word rejoice is better translated boast.
[time=2922] Those whose only pride and claim in life is that they know Him.
[time=2926] Paul said, "God forbid that I should glory, except for in the cross of Jesus Christ my Lord." By whom I am crucified to the world and the world is crucified to me, Galatians 6, 14.
[time=2940] Jeremiah, the prophet, said, "Let the mighty man not boast in the strength or the wise man err in his wisdom, but let him rejoice in that he knows God." Men and women today, the church of Jesus Christ suffers from false pride.
[time=2956] There are people today who are boastful and they're proud.
[time=2960] Remember, going to a church long before I was a Christian.
[time=2963] And every three months, they gave a perfect attendance pin.
[time=2967] So you could get one every three months for a year.
[time=2970] By the time this one young man was about 16 or 17 years old, Floyd, he had so many perfect attendance pins, he made General Eisenhower a balance shame.
[time=2979] I mean, this guy was decorated.
[time=2982] And he was so proud of his attendance in church.
[time=2987] He became a badge and a credential that I attend church.
[time=2991] Therefore, I am spiritual.
[time=2993] And God said, "Don't boast in anything but Jesus Christ." You know, those today that are proud, they're proud of their own personal convictions.
[time=3002] And men and women, I believe you ought to have convictions.
[time=3004] I believe you ought to maintain your convictions with tenacity and we'll talk about that in a moment.
[time=3009] But you know there are those today that are proud.
[time=3012] They say, "I am spiritual because I never drink any alcoholic
[time=3018] beverages, therefore I am spiritual." And they're proud, they're so proud.
[time=3023] There are others that somebody mentions a film, a movie, and they say, "Oh, I'm never going to do that." And it becomes a spiritual badge, a credential that which they boast.
[time=3034] These men were boasting that they worshiped on the right day and they worshiped with the right sacrifice.
[time=3039] And God said, "Don't boast in your religion.
[time=3041] Simply boast in that you know Christ." And that is the most humbling thing you can boast in.
[time=3046] Have you ever seen someone drown and be rescued and have them boast about being rescued?
[time=3053] Didn't you see me out there and I was tremendous?
[time=3055] I was down there boo-boo-boo, and this guy rescued.
[time=3057] And think that they're great?
[time=3059] No, they're humble, they're thankful.
[time=3061] And the boast in Jesus Christ simply means that we're saying, "Well, I'm thankful that he's redeemed me." Thirdly, those that have no confidence in the flesh.
[time=3071] No confidence in the flesh.
[time=3074] And a woman may I encourage you not to use these words.
[time=3080] "Well, I would never." The Bible tells you that you are in great danger.
[time=3087] 1 Corinthians 10-12 says this, "Beware, when you think you stand, lest you fall.
[time=3096] Without naming names, we could spend this hour speaking about different Christian leaders who proclaim with great boldness conviction only to break those conviction." Men and women don't have any confidence in your flesh.
[time=3116] Believe your convictions.
[time=3117] Strive to live by them.
[time=3119] But don't be confident that you're going to live superior to the rest of us.
[time=3124] There were those who were confident that they could keep the law.
[time=3128] Do you remember the rich young ruler that came to Christ through the arrogance of that young man?
[time=3133] He came to Christ and he said, "Good master, what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?" Without asking the question, answering the question, Jesus probes and he asks, "Have you heard the law?" And he said, "Yes, I've heard the law and the arrogance." He said, "And I have kept the whole thing." Men and women, he had confidence in the flesh.
[time=3156] And his confidence in the flesh kept him from Jesus Christ.
[time=3159] And he walked away.
[time=3161] Don't have any confidence in the flesh.
[time=3165] Now I'm going to make application.
[time=3168] Some of you will not particularly enjoy this.
[time=3171] Don't say it to be divisive.
[time=3174] I say it because this is exactly what this passage is teaching in the way of application.
[time=3180] Paul is speaking about a group of people who came and what they did was they added laws to the Word of God.
[time=3189] And in adding laws, he robbed the Philippians of their joy.
[time=3193] Here's Paul's logic.
[time=3194] Rejoice in the Lord and if you want to rejoice in the Lord, you've got to be aware of legalizers.
[time=3200] Now men and women, I possess two personal convictions.
[time=3204] Let me share these with you and they are personal convictions.
[time=3207] It's important that you understand that they are simply my convictions.
[time=3211] I live by them.
[time=3212] I believe them.
[time=3213] However, they're convictions.
[time=3215] One is I do not drink alcoholic beverages.
[time=3220] The other is I do not go to secular films.
[time=3223] Those are personal convictions.
[time=3225] I live by them.
[time=3226] Now let me explain something to you this morning.
[time=3230] If you make either one of those an absolute you sin.
[time=3237] The most dangerous thing that you could say this morning and it is said often is that it is a sin to drink.
[time=3246] Men and women, if you say that, you have denied yourself of eternal life because Jesus Christ is then a sinner.
[time=3258] And if he sinned, he was not capable of saving you and I.
[time=3263] And there are those today that want to add laws to the Word of God.
[time=3268] Men and women, I believe you ought to have convictions.
[time=3270] I believe you ought to study the Word of God and develop convictions.
[time=3273] I believe you ought to be keenly sensitive to how you're influencing other people.
[time=3280] And I believe you ought to live by those convictions as I do.
[time=3284] Men and women, you danger greatly when you say to someone else that they sin because they don't keep your personal conviction.
[time=3293] And what you do is two things.
[time=3295] You rob yourself of potential joy because you begin to add list upon list upon list upon list, you become a legalizer.
[time=3303] Not if you hold it as conviction, but when you set it up as an absolute and secondly, you rob other people of joy simply because they do not have the same personal conviction that you do.
[time=3316] I believe in my convictions for me.
[time=3320] I do not believe in them for everyone.
[time=3322] I had a friend at Talbot Theological Seminary who said there was a point in my life where I absolutely said it is wrong to drink wine.
[time=3331] He said, "Then God called me to be a missionary in France." You know, it's a whole different culture here.
[time=3337] They didn't go through the 1920s temperance movement in the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Hillsborough, Ohio, 1881.
[time=3346] They didn't have the great prohibitionist campaign of Henry Beecher Stowe.
[time=3351] They did not go through the culture that we went through.
[time=3354] And in their culture it is not an issue.
[time=3358] He said, "I learned that over there that if I was to be effective for Christ, then I was to participate in their culture, just as you participate in a culture here.
[time=3366] I know the danger of robbing someone else of their joy and of robbing someone else of the opportunity to have the freedom in Christ and the joy simply because they have different convictions." Now, if you're a conservative and I'm basically I'm a conservative, then we are often a little bit more proud because we can say, "Why don't?
[time=3386] And I don't, and I don't, but men and women in this issue.
[time=3390] It is not a matter of conservative versus liberal." Romans tells us that neither he is conservative or he is liberal who is right.
[time=3398] It is he that does not judge the other one's servant.
[time=3400] It is he that lives by his conviction.
[time=3402] It is he that lives by faith and he that can accept the brother who differs.
[time=3407] And Paul was writing about a group of people that came and they added to the law and he called them dogs.
[time=3412] He called them evil workers and he called them the party of mutilation.
[time=3417] And there are those today that are mutilating Christians because of simple difference of personal conviction.
[time=3423] Men and women, you're welcome here today if your conviction's different than mine.
[time=3426] Live by your convictions.
[time=3430] I believe as men we ought to have convictions and establish them in our home.
[time=3434] I believe as a church we ought to have convictions.
[time=3437] I believe as a Christian school we ought to values, but we can teach values and we can teach convictions without equating them that thus say at the law when God never said it.
[time=3448] This morning I stood up and I lamb blasted liberals for not believing in Genesis account of creation of knowing the art you would praise me.
[time=3456] If today I castigated the liberals that doubt the historicity of the person of Jesus Christ, that would be praised because they're terrible.
[time=3463] They detract from the word of God.
[time=3466] But you know that God holds in the same disdain, those that add to his word.
[time=3471] And revelation tells us if any man add to these words, let the curse of this book be added unto him.
[time=3477] And if you haven't read the book of Revelation, trust me, you should not want any of those things to befall your life.
[time=3483] How can you be joyful today?
[time=3485] First of all, you can be joyful today by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, by receiving him into your heart by faith.
[time=3494] Secondly, today you can be joyful if having received Jesus Christ, you'll walk in obedience.
[time=3500] He'll return you the joy of your salvation by simply confessing your sin to him.
[time=3505] And finally, you can have joy today if you're walking free in Christ.
[time=3509] Blessed is the man whose heart condemns it not.
[time=3511] Live by your convictions, but live freely from the convictions of others.
[time=3516] Garden, don't hurt another, don't cause another to stumble, but live free in Christ today.
[time=3522] Let's pray together.
