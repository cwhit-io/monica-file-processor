[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] (bell ringing) (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=80] Each week Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the word of God.
[time=87] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=98] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=103] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prooger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=114] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour Musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=123] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=131] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=138] For those of you who are in Fort Wayne, you know that this is a cold, snowy, blowy, icy, frozen day.
[time=146] We've packed our auditorium with about 30 people.
[time=149] Normally we have about 1,200 people here for our morning worship services, crowded into two services.
[time=156] Today we have you all centered here on the floor.
[time=159] We're thankful you've come, but we're thankful today for the opportunity to share the Bible Hour with many of you who would be at your church.
[time=168] Thank you for joining us on this special day.
[time=171] Some of you will be watching this broadcast two weeks delayed in Indianapolis, Chicago, and South Bend.
[time=177] And if it's sunny, the day you see this, don't think that we've lost our minds.
[time=181] It's just two weeks delayed for you.
[time=183] But we can worship God even this morning.
[time=187] With the snow and with the cold, I'm reminded of the words of the Apostle Paul when he said that I am bound as a prisoner for Jesus Christ, but the word of God is not bound.
[time=197] I'm thankful that God's given us television as a way of sharing his word on these cold and clement mornings.
[time=204] We not only can share God's word with you, but the ministry of music also.
[time=208] Steve and Maria Gardner have ventured out into the cold.
[time=211] They live about 12 miles away, but they've made it this morning that they might lead you in a time of praise singing for you about the Lord Jesus Christ, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=222] (upbeat music)
[time=232] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=346] He has done great things, he has done great things.
[time=369] He has done great things, bless his holy name.
[time=381] For God is the King God, and the power, and the glory forever.
[time=399] [MUSIC]
[time=422] Welcome to the Bible Hour, this morning on this sixth, our fifth snowy morning.
[time=427] I'm not sure how many it's been, but it seems like every morning we welcome you and reference the fact that it's cold, snowy, icy, the wind is blowing, and it's just wretched outside. Welcome, Don. Glad to have you with us this morning.
[time=441] Glad to have you with us, too, Pastor Rick. I got here before you, and we understand you had a little problem.
[time=446] Oh, just a little bit. I left the house at about 7.30 this morning to get here in my
[time=452] two-minute drive to the church, and when I got out, I got stuck once in our addition, and then I thought, boy, I'm going to make sure I have plenty of gas, and I went to the gas station, got stuck in a snow drift in the middle of the gas station parking lot. No one was there, the attendant couldn't make it in this morning, so I'm rocking back and forth trying to get my car out, and then the battery goes dead because it kept stalling, and stalling, and stalling.
[time=476] Finally, though, I met a good Samaritan who gave me a jump, got some gas, and made it here about an hour and a half later. Did you have any trouble?
[time=484] Well, we're having company today at our house. We're supposed to have company, and I don't suppose those folks are going to be able to arrive, and my wife looked at the roast this morning and she said, "I don't think that's going to be enough. Maybe we better go get something else." So I was at Rogers parking lot at about 8 o'clock this morning, picking up some chicken and some things like that, and I got stuck in my driveway on the way back, and while I was at Rogers, something very interesting, I saw some people who were filling up their basket, and they said that they were on their way to church, but after they looked at the roads, in fact they live in countryside near you, and they said as they looked at the roads, they just knew that they were not going to make it, so they decided to fill up with groceries, and they'd be able to be in their place if they're going to be stuck for a couple of days with a lot of groceries. So I said, "Tune into the Bible hour this morning at 11 o'clock. If you can't go to your own church, come on to ours." So maybe those folks are listening, and I hope you are.
[time=542] What is a terribly cold morning out there, but you know your story about those people who couldn't make it to church this morning reminds me of a biography that I read one time. In London, England, over 100 years ago, a young man of about 17 or 18
[time=556] years of age, did determine which was the best church to go to, and what he should truly believe, this young man set out on a tour of all of the great churches of London, trying to find a true relationship with Jesus Christ and a church that could minister to him. And one cold morning, he had set out to go to a church that he'd predetermined to go to, and as the snow blew and blew and blew, halfway there he realized he would never make it, and if he did, he'd be way past the time of the service.
[time=586] He turned around to go home, and as he turned around he saw one little church open, just kind of a storefront church. It was a primitive Methodist church. The young man went in, only six other people made it to church that morning, and the preacher did not.
[time=602] And after a while they decided that one old gentleman should at least say a few words since people had come. He was a coal miner, an uneducated man, not skilled in either speech or in knowledge of the Bible.
[time=614] But he got up and he spoke, and he referenced the book of numbers where if the people of Israel looked up to the brazen serpent they would live. And Jesus' statement about himself that if he be lifted up he will draw them in unto himself. And this coal miner simply made this simple message, look and live. Look to Jesus Christ and live. Look and be saved.
[time=638] That young man accepted Jesus Christ that morning, went on to be the greatest preacher, perhaps, in the history of England. That young man was Charles Haddon Spurgeon. So God's got a plan even in weather like this. That's a tremendous story, Pastor Rick. It really is. You think that on a day like this nothing good could be accomplished.
[time=658] But that isn't true in the life of this man. That's really true.
[time=662] God is sovereign and he's in control. I sit and I say which one of us is in charge of praying for good weather and let's get him out of there and get another prayer boy you're in there because we love to fellowship together. And on these cold snowy mornings we don't have that chance.
[time=678] But God's got a plan. He's got a purpose in these events and we know he's sovereign. You know Paul wrote from prison and he said I'm bound for the gospel of Jesus Christ. But the word of God is not bound. And you know this morning I'm thankful for our opportunity through television to share with you the life changing power of Jesus Christ. And we are going to have a great opportunity to talk with many, many new friends today who never have seen the Bible hour but because they could make it the church today they're joining us. Welcome to you our old friends and our new friends. And we have something special we want to share with you. The ministry of the word of God is not bound and can be applied to your life every day. Don has some information to share with you about a meaningful approach to Bible study.
[time=730] Pastor Rick we have this little book called Timeless Insights that we've been offering to our television friends. And as you say there are some new ones that are watching and maybe this is just for you this morning. It's a little devotional guide.
[time=742] It has something for every single day in the month.
[time=746] We want to send it to you so it could be a help to you in your devotional life.
[time=750] It is a tremendous little book. It has a verse of scripture at the beginning of every one of these pages for every day.
[time=758] And then it has a timeless insight. That is some word from some great man who has lived and gone on. Like for instance.
[time=766] Is that are you in there? I think I'm going to be in but I'm not as yet. No I'm not in there. I wish I were.
[time=774] Harry Ironsides. Men like Harry Ironsides.
[time=778] And Jonathan Edwards. Like for instance.
[time=782] Here is a story on Jonathan Edwards right in the middle. It's not a part of one of the days devotional but it talks about Jonathan Edwards the preacher and the scholar.
[time=790] And throughout this book this particular issue there are a lot of little nuggets of what Jonathan Edwards had to say about certain verses of scripture that we have here. This is a tremendous little book.
[time=802] And I know you would enjoy it if you just write to us. The Bible Hour.
[time=806] Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815.
[time=810] We would love to send this little book with timeless insights to you. That's the Bible Hour. Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815.
[time=822] Right today and maybe this is just the reason why you are home watching our program today. That could be.
[time=830] Don I've had constant encouragement from people to say oh we're so thankful that we're using that daily devotional.
[time=838] We had tremendous response to our booklet The Daily Walk. But people seemed to like this better. The Daily Walk took us through the entire Bible one year. We jokingly called The Daily Walk The Monthly Leap because you had to read four and five chapters a day and it was easy to get behind and then you'd read and read and read to get caught up and we called it The Monthly Leap.
[time=858] But this booklet just takes you through the New Testament alone in one year makes it a shorter passage to read and a little bit more meaningful and so enjoyable. Just this week I was in the hospital visiting a lady from our church. One of the first things she had to say was how much timeless insights meant to her because she had so much time on her hand. She was in mid-February. She's less than here in January. But it's such a tremendous little booklet. We're glad that we can share it with you. Won't you write to us today? Write The Bible Hour.
[time=890] Box 15,000. Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=894] 46815. We know that many of you are faithfully involved in a church of your own and just happen to be joining us today.
[time=902] May I give you a word of encouragement from me and from your pastor and that is this. Your church is not only committed to serving Jesus Christ but they're committed to serving Him with you and they're dependent upon you in many ways. You may sing in the choir, teach Sunday school or in some way you're helping but every one of us can help in the financial ministries of our church. And when a church misses a Sunday we miss our only real day of income and your church budget probably is suffering tremendously this year because of so many snowy Sundays.
[time=938] We know you've joined us today but we want to encourage you to send your regular gifts to your church. The place where you worship regularly that they might be financially secure in these difficult days of bad economy and frustrating days of bad weather. It would mean much to your pastor. If you would take the time to mail it in even this week and then we'd encourage you to think of the Bible hour too. Many of you are long time friends some of you are new friends. We continually encounter a need for finances our costs are always increasing and people are not able to give as they used to but perhaps God would lay it upon your heart to support the Bible hour today. Even if you can't send a financial gift we'd love to hear from you. Whether you're an old time friend or a new listener today if you've joined us for the Bible hour today please write to us. Don would you give them that address one more time?
[time=994] That address is the Bible hour. 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815 Now be sure to write to us right today and ask for the timeless insight devotional guide. That's the Bible hour box 15,000 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815. In just a few minutes we're going to hear some more good music
[time=1019] Pastor Rick from Steve and Maria Gardner. They live out in the country but they were able to get in because they have a van and I don't know if they're going to be able to get back but they're here and I've enjoyed their good music so far and we're going to hear some more good music from them in just a few minutes.
[time=1033] I'm looking forward to that and also for my opportunity to share with you how you can triumph in loss. This is the tax season and people are calculating their profit and loss financially.
[time=1045] But if you've taken a spiritual inventory of your life, have you audited your relationship with Jesus Christ?
[time=1051] I invite you to do that with us today. Join us for the rest of the Bible hour for special music and a message from God's Word. God bless you.
[time=1067] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=1096] And sorrow would lie, so sinful, so weary, like that would I be.
[time=1115] The blessed rock of age, I'm hiding in thee, hiding in thee.
[time=1142] The blessed rock of age, I'm hiding in thee.
[time=1172] How oft in the cards, when pressed by the foe,
[time=1186] have I fled to my refuge, and breathed out my woe?
[time=1200] How oft in when trials, like sea billows rose, have I hidden in thee,
[time=1217] hold thou worth my soul, hiding in thee, hiding in thee,
[time=1239] the blessed rock of age, I'm hiding in thee, hiding in thee.
[time=1269] Thank you, Marie, I know that song will be a tremendous blessing to many, many people.
[time=1275] Not only do we have a snow storm, but many of us encounter the storms of life, and Jesus Christ is the blessed rock upon which we can stand.
[time=1283] We're so thankful that you came this morning, you don't live right around the corner like I do.
[time=1288] How far away is it?
[time=1289] Well, I heard you say 12 miles, I guess that's probably pretty close.
[time=1292] It's over the river and through the woods that way always.
[time=1296] Mr. Grandma's house, no doubt.
[time=1299] Well we're so appreciative of the fact that you came out this morning to sing and to be a part of this ministry, to share the gospel through music with these people.
[time=1308] Would you just take a moment and tell people a little bit about your ministry?
[time=1311] I know that particularly our television family sees you almost every other week, but probably they don't know a great deal about you.
[time=1318] Just tell them a little bit about your ministry and what you do on a weekly basis.
[time=1322] Rick, we've been traveling full time in a traveling ministry for almost 12 years, and that means we go all over the country and sometimes out of the country to minister to people, and we don't have a normal week or a normal month, it's different every week.
[time=1337] Sometimes we're home two days, sometimes we're home five days, it just depends on like this week we go to the West Coast for a week, so we're just kind of all over and we love what we do.
[time=1346] Do you need someone to go along to the West Coast maybe?
[time=1348] Just particularly if you want a last week in Detroit you wouldn't have cared too much.
[time=1352] No, I was busy last week.
[time=1355] We're so excited about your ministry, and again just so appreciative of your friendship.
[time=1360] Many people don't realize, particularly through the television, that Steve and Marie are part of our church.
[time=1366] They joined our church about a year and a half, two years ago now, and they've just served in every way they possibly can.
[time=1372] We appreciate their friendship.
[time=1374] They're going to sing again for us now.
[time=1376] What are you going to sing at this time?
[time=1378] Leave me to Calvary.
[time=1380] Well, I know that it'll be a blessing to our hearts.
[time=1383] Thank you and thank each one of you for joining us today for the Bible Hour and for church here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1391] You deserve perfect attendance pins for being here today, but we're now going to listen to you as you minister to us through music.
[time=1398] Lead us to Calvary.
[time=1417] King of my life, I crown thee now, thine shall the glory be me.
[time=1427] Let's I forgive thy thorn, crown, brow, lead me to Calvary.
[time=1440] Let's I forget thy agony.
[time=1447] Let's I forget get sinning, let's I forget the love for me.
[time=1461] Leave me alone to Calvary, may I be willing, Lord, to them.
[time=1475] Lately my cross for thee, even my birth, a grief to the shame that thou hast poured
[time=1491] me.
[time=1502] Let's I forgive thy agony, let's I forget the love for me, me to Calvary.
[time=1519] Don't let me forget get sinning, I can't forget your agony, let's I forget your love
[time=1541] for me, me to Calvary.
[time=1562] Thank you for turning our eyes to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and to Calvary.
[time=1568] As they were singing I was standing behind the curtain and we have a window off to the side and I can see the wind still blowing, the snow coming down, but it reminds me of the truth that God said, "Though your sins be a scarlet, they shall be as wool, though they be as crimson, I shall wash them, white as snow." It was at Calvary that Jesus Christ forgave our sins and he washed them all way.
[time=1592] If we would simply allow his spirit this morning to lead us to Mount Calvary and to see
[time=1598] the person of Jesus Christ and his death for us, we would then realize the beauty of this
[time=1604] day because it pictures the forgiveness of sins that's in Christ Jesus.
[time=1610] With the wind still blowing, the snow still coming down, I need to announce both to those of you who are here in our auditorium and those of you who are part of Blackhawk Baptist Church at home this morning that we will not have an evening service tonight.
[time=1624] I was a holdout.
[time=1625] I kept saying, "We ought to wait, it's going to turn better and we'll really feel bad if we announce there's no church tonight," and then the sun comes out and the wind stops blowing and I got a tremendous response from the rest of our staff.
[time=1638] We're going to get 12 inches, they're saying, and we won't have church tonight, but we hope next week that we can worship together in this place.
[time=1646] I invite you now to open your Bibles to the Book of Philippians in the third chapter.
[time=1651] In these winter days, we're studying through Philippians chapter 3, we're taking an inductive study where we go verse by verse and we analyze what the text has to say.
[time=1662] Rather than this morning for us to study the opinions of man, we need to study the opinion of God, what God has to say about us.
[time=1670] This is the tax season, it's a time of inventory and business, it's a time for auditing in
[time=1676] corporations, and it's good for us to take an inventory of our spiritual life.
[time=1681] This past week I went over to Winona Lake where I had my taxes done, and they did an assessment of where I was financially, and in doing that they look at your assets, that which you possess,
[time=1693] that which you have is of value and your liabilities, your indebtedness, and they measure the two together to determine an individual's net worth, and that gives indication of where you
[time=1704] are financially.
[time=1706] We do that annually, the government insists that we fill out taxes.
[time=1710] Businesses take the time to get an outside firm to come in and audit, to examine exactly where their books are, where they are at financially, to give accountability to their clientele
[time=1721] and to their investors, but also that they might know their exact cash and financial
[time=1727] position.
[time=1729] Businesses take an inventory where they go through their store and the inventory, that which they possess, and you know I stopped and thought how important that would be for you and I to audit our lives spiritually, to take an inventory of what we possess and
[time=1745] what we lack, and to determine what is our net worth.
[time=1750] What are we worth this morning spiritually?
[time=1752] What are our assets and what are our liabilities?
[time=1756] I believe in Philippians the third chapter, Paul is talking about profit and loss.
[time=1761] He's talking about an inventory and audit, if you will, of his own life.
[time=1766] I believe it's important for us to set the background, and even though we'll only be speaking on verses 5, 6, and 7 this morning, I want to read the first four verses along
[time=1777] with those that we'll be studying today, Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1782] Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1786] To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not grievous, but for you, it is safe.
[time=1794] Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of concision.
[time=1801] For we are the circumcision who worship God in the Spirit and who rejoice in Christ Jesus
[time=1807] and have no confidence in the flesh, though I might also have confidence in the flesh.
[time=1815] If any other man thinketh that he hath reasons for which he might trust in the flesh, I
[time=1822] more.
[time=1824] I exercise the eighth day, the stock of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews
[time=1831] as touching the law of Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the
[time=1839] righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
[time=1845] But what things were gained to me, those I count loss for Christ, yea, doubtlessly, and
[time=1853] I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[time=1860] for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refused, that I may
[time=1866] win Christ.
[time=1869] What Paul is doing is he has stated a word of warning, and that word of warning was to beware of dogs, to beware of evil workers, and thirdly to beware of concision.
[time=1879] What he was doing is he was referencing a group of people who taught false doctrine.
[time=1885] Their teaching was this, while they did not disclaim Jesus Christ as Savior, they said
[time=1891] that for you and I as individuals to be saved to know that we have eternal life and a home in heaven, that you and I must be keepers of the law, we must be obedient to Jewish tradition,
[time=1902] we must in fact obey the law that we might be saved by the law.
[time=1907] And as we studied last week, Paul said, oh no, God has said those who are truly Christians are those that worship him in spirit, not worship him in ceremony, but worship him in their heart.
[time=1918] And the true worshipers are not those who simply do good deeds while good deeds are good, but
[time=1924] they are those who rejoice, who boast in Jesus Christ, and thirdly those that have no confidence
[time=1931] in the flesh.
[time=1932] He was saying those that knew that they had no ability within their own life to earn salvation.
[time=1939] And then in verse four he says, if ever there was a man who could say, I have earned my way
[time=1945] to heaven, I have kept the law, I've done everything that God would demand.
[time=1949] If ever there was a man who could earn his way to heaven, Paul said, I'm the man.
[time=1955] I'm the man.
[time=1957] So in verses five and six he is going to give to us his pedigree, he is going to review for
[time=1964] us that which he believes to be his spiritual assets.
[time=1969] I believe that by the end of our study we will discover that his assets are truly liabilities.
[time=1974] But he begins to say if anyone could earn his way to heaven, then truly I'm the man.
[time=1981] He lists for us seven assets, the first asset, circumcised the eighth day, and our assets
[time=1990] that we will see, we will discover that some of those assets are inherited, some of them are acquired.
[time=1996] Now you may understand that financially.
[time=1999] You may have inherited something of a financial benefit from an ancestor.
[time=2004] Now you possess it, although you did nothing to deserve it, it was simply given to you as a birthright.
[time=2011] Other things that we possess as assets are things that we earn.
[time=2015] Money that we earn, we invest in certificates of bonds, our stocks.
[time=2020] We invest it and now it enhances our cash value.
[time=2023] That becomes an earned asset.
[time=2026] Paul begins by saying spiritually, my first asset is one which I've inherited, circumcised
[time=2033] the eighth day.
[time=2034] In the Jewish economy, the sign of the covenant between God and Abraham was circumcision.
[time=2041] God came to Abraham and to his wife, Sarah, when they were greatly advanced in age in
[time=2047] their 90s.
[time=2049] And he said, I'm going to make of you Abraham a great nation.
[time=2052] I'm going to cause your seed to multiply and fill the earth.
[time=2056] Abraham, out of your line, is going to come one who will bless the whole nation.
[time=2062] Abraham said, Lord, I'm 90.
[time=2066] I'm 90 years old and I don't even have a son, a daughter.
[time=2070] We have no children.
[time=2072] Lord how are you now in my old age going to multiply a seed that I don't have to fill the earth?
[time=2079] And when Abraham relayed this information to Sarah, it got such a response from her that she laughed.
[time=2084] She thought she was joking or that God was joking.
[time=2089] God was true to his word and he gave him a son and that son's name was Isaac.
[time=2094] And as a sign of the covenant, God said, you will take Isaac and you will circumcise him and it became a ceremony and a ritual, a mark of the Jews that said, these people are the people of the covenant and the Jews trusted in their obedience to ritual.
[time=2111] Their obedience to ceremony, that this ceremony was going to save them and if simply they
[time=2117] obeyed their ritual, then they would be pleasing to God and God would allow them entrance into heaven because they obeyed the law.
[time=2125] They said, we keep the ritual.
[time=2129] We do what God expects, therefore we are God's people and not the Gentiles.
[time=2134] We shall go to heaven.
[time=2136] We are part of his kingdom because we are circumcised.
[time=2140] Paul not only said, we do it, he said, we do it right, we circumcise on the eighth day.
[time=2147] You see in the law of God, it was on the eighth day that the baby boys were to be circumcised.
[time=2153] The Ishmaelites, the half brothers of Isaac circumcised but they did it at thirteen years
[time=2160] of age.
[time=2161] And there was tremendous rivalry between the line of Ishmael and the line of Isaac, both
[time=2167] of them were sons of Abraham, Isaac by his wife Sarah, Ishmael by a slave, Hagar.
[time=2173] If you see Abraham lacked faith and knowing that Sarah was barren and God said, you'll
[time=2179] have a son, he contrived his own plan.
[time=2182] And he said, for me to have a son, then I must take my wife's handmaid and Hagar, take her as my wife and I'll raise up a seed by Hagar.
[time=2191] And she bore and conceived and gave birth to a son and his name was Ishmael.
[time=2196] But there was a departure as there was rivalry and Ishmael left and Isaac stayed and they formed two dynasties, two lines, both of them claiming the inheritance and the birth rights and the privileges of being the sons of Abraham.
[time=2211] But Paul said, I am not an Ishmaelite, I am circumcised, I keep the ritual but I do
[time=2217] it in the right way on the eighth day.
[time=2220] But you know Paul wasn't the only one that trusted in ritual to save him.
[time=2225] There are hundreds, thousands, even millions of people today who are trusting in ritual
[time=2231] to save them.
[time=2233] You know there was a great danger with circumcision, Jeremiah the prophets spoke of it, that in
[time=2240] history the circumcision as a sign of the covenant lost its meaning and the true relationship
[time=2247] with God was lost.
[time=2249] And people stopped worshiping God in spirit and believing on him and they started trusting
[time=2255] in the external sign of circumcision.
[time=2258] And so Jeremiah the prophet warned the people to circumcise their hearts.
[time=2264] You know that there are today those who trust in ritual, they trust in baptism.
[time=2271] Are we against baptism?
[time=2273] No we're not.
[time=2274] We are a Baptist church.
[time=2275] This past Wednesday we baptized people.
[time=2278] Is that meaningless?
[time=2279] No it is not meaningless.
[time=2281] It has tremendous value as a symbol and as a sign but baptism saves no one.
[time=2288] And there are millions today who are trusting that their ritual of baptism is that which is going to please God and allow them entrance into heaven.
[time=2298] Could I explain to you what baptism is?
[time=2302] Baptism is simply an outward symbol of my inward faith.
[time=2306] This morning I wear a ring, this ring symbolizes the fact that I am married.
[time=2311] My wife's name is Kathy.
[time=2314] We were married and we took a vow and that vow was an internal commitment made public.
[time=2319] And then we exchange rings as a sign of our commitment.
[time=2324] A ring on the fourth finger of a left hand indicates marriage.
[time=2328] But should I take this ring off this morning, I'm still married.
[time=2332] Had I never put it on in the first place, I was still married.
[time=2336] Did you find this ring and I had lost it and put it on?
[time=2340] That ring would not make you married.
[time=2342] This ring is not marriage.
[time=2344] It is simply a symbol of marriage.
[time=2348] Baptism is not salvation.
[time=2350] It is simply a symbol that as we believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that
[time=2357] he was buried, we're lowered into the water.
[time=2359] And Paul said we are buried with him in baptism and as we are raised out of the water, pictures that we believe that Jesus Christ arose from the grave.
[time=2369] You see, baptism saves no one.
[time=2372] There's a misleading phrase, not a misleading phrase but a misleading interpretation of a phrase in 1 Peter 3.
[time=2379] And if you lift it out of context, you can make it say something that it doesn't.
[time=2384] Out of context it says this, baptism does now save you.
[time=2390] And there are those that say, "Aha, therefore, if I baptize my baby, or if I am baptized then I shall be saved," but it's out of context.
[time=2398] For the context says baptism does now save you, not the washing away of sins but a testimony
[time=2407] of a pure conscience before God.
[time=2409] What is it that saves us?
[time=2411] The pure conscience with baptism simply symbolizes.
[time=2415] It's so important that when you study the scriptures that you read context, you may have heard the story about a young man who took verses out of context.
[time=2424] He wanted to know God's will for his life.
[time=2427] So there's Bible and he roamed his finger on it, he planted it down and it said, "Judas went out and hung himself." He surely didn't like that as God's will for his life, so he flipped it back and he roamed it and he plopped it down and it said, "Go and do likewise." Well he didn't like that, so he tried one more time and put his finger down and it said, "What thou doest?
[time=2449] Do quickly." Now is that really God's will for his life?
[time=2452] No he ignored context.
[time=2455] Men and women, if you ignore the true teaching of the word of God, you'll be deceived and you'll believe that you have an asset in baptism and that baptism saves you.
[time=2464] Baptism saves no one, no one.
[time=2468] What can wash away my sin?
[time=2470] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=2473] Oh, precious, is that flow, that makes me white as snow.
[time=2478] Baptism saves no one.
[time=2480] And as Paul listed his assets, he says, "I have an asset in my ritual." There are those today that are deceived and they believe that the ritual of baptism will
[time=2491] save them.
[time=2492] Men and women, nothing in the form of ritual can make us acceptable in the eyes of God.
[time=2500] The second asset of the stock of Israel, of the nation of Israel.
[time=2507] Paul first was proud of his ritual, now he is proud of his nationality.
[time=2512] There was great intense rivalry between many nations, one in particular the Ishmaelites
[time=2519] and the Israelites.
[time=2522] Another nation, the Edomites, we've already discussed how there was tension between Ishmael and Isaac, two brothers, and there was national rivalry.
[time=2531] But then there were two other brothers, Jacob and Esau, Esau the first born, Esau the recipient
[time=2537] of the birthright, the beneficiary of being the first born.
[time=2541] But Jacob, the conniver, tricks him out of his birthright.
[time=2545] And Esau has to flee and leave the land in the promise of perpetuation to Jacob.
[time=2552] And now Esau's line becomes a new nation.
[time=2555] Esau, like the word Edom, both mean red.
[time=2559] And so the Edomites become intense rivalries with the Israelites.
[time=2564] And Paul now was going to brag of his nationality.
[time=2568] He said, "I am not just a Jew because I was circumcised and I follow the covenant of Abraham."
[time=2576] He now says, "I also follow the covenant of Jacob who was renamed Isaac and he was proud
[time=2582] of his nationality.
[time=2584] The Jews were the chosen people.
[time=2585] They were unique and they are unique this day in their relationship to God.
[time=2591] It was to the Jews that God revealed himself in his word.
[time=2595] It was to the Jews that God gave the forms of the Old Testament sacrifice which prefigured the birth of Christ.
[time=2602] And even this day, God has a special hand upon the nation of Israel and he is not finished
[time=2608] with Israel yet.
[time=2609] They are his people, but we are his people because we have received Christ as Savior.
[time=2616] But Paul said, "My second asset I have also inherited and that is I am of the right nation.
[time=2622] The blood of Israel flows through my veins." You know those today that believe that their nationality merits them favor before God?
[time=2632] Not just the Jewish people today.
[time=2635] You know there is an arrogance about Americans that we believe that because we are of this nation and we hold to the American values because we believe in liberty.
[time=2645] We believe in equality that those values that we possess as a nation make us pleasing to
[time=2651] God and therefore because of our national identification, God is uniquely blessing this
[time=2657] land and he will bless the inhabitants of this land with eternal life.
[time=2662] I've been a woman I'm thankful to be an American today.
[time=2665] I praise God for the liberty of this land.
[time=2668] As I read in U.S. News and World Report this week, the gross national product of the United
[time=2674] States this year will probably exceed the gross national product of the combined nations
[time=2681] of Japan, Germany, France and Great Britain, the next four leading countries in the free
[time=2687] world.
[time=2688] I'm so proud and thankful to be a part of this country but being an American may give you great freedom.
[time=2695] Being an American may give you great wealth but being American will not give you eternal
[time=2701] life.
[time=2702] Paul said I was of the stock of Israel.
[time=2705] I had the blood of Israel flowing through my veins but he also learned the truth of the New Testament.
[time=2711] The Bible says this in John chapter 1 verses 11, 12 and 13, Jesus came unto his own but
[time=2720] his own received him not, therefore to as many as received him to them he gave the power
[time=2726] to become the children of God even to them that believe on his name.
[time=2731] Those who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh but of the will of God born
[time=2737] not of blood, that phrase is saying not of blood, we must be born spiritually.
[time=2744] Our national birth does not merit us an asset spiritually.
[time=2749] It can actually be a great liability.
[time=2751] You may be sleeping spiritually today because you believe that your asset of nationality
[time=2757] will save you.
[time=2759] Paul's third asset born of the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2764] Oh, Benjamin, the favorite son of all of the sons.
[time=2770] Jacob had 12 sons and the last son, Benjamin was his favorite son.
[time=2776] He was special because Benjamin was born of Rachel.
[time=2781] Rachel was the love of Jacob's life.
[time=2783] So much did he love her that he labored seven years to earn the right to marry her from Laban, her father.
[time=2790] And then Laban tricked him and said all right now that your seven years are up you can marry but you must marry my oldest daughter, Leah, because the oldest must be married before the youngest.
[time=2799] And then he married Leah and he labored seven more years for Rachel.
[time=2805] Do not believe that the Bible even condones let alone encourages polygamy.
[time=2810] It was simply a custom of that day and while we do not approve of polygamy, we must acknowledge
[time=2816] the fact that Jacob loved Rachel more than anyone else and she gave birth to a son and
[time=2823] his name was Benjamin.
[time=2825] And Benjamin became the pride of his life and Benjamin became the special tribe of Israel
[time=2831] so that when the kind came for the judges and Deborah and other judges need to summon
[time=2837] mighty warriors to defend the land.
[time=2840] They summoned 300 right handed stone throwers of the tribe of Benjamin to defend the nation
[time=2846] and they defended it.
[time=2847] And Benjamin was a special tribe.
[time=2850] And the nation of Israel said we would have a king they looked for a man of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, King Saul.
[time=2857] Oh, and then there came a special time of devotion of the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2864] Upon the death of Solomon, Rehoboam remained loyal, not wise but loyal.
[time=2869] Jeroboam led a nation unto apostasy.
[time=2873] When nations went and disobeyed God, Judah stayed and one other tribe stayed loyal to
[time=2879] God.
[time=2880] It was the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2883] To be a Benjamin I meant that you were a leading family of the day.
[time=2887] It would be like being a Kennedy or a Rockefeller or a Carnegie today, was a name of great prestige.
[time=2893] It was a name of significance.
[time=2895] It was a name of tradition, good, moral, religious tradition.
[time=2901] These were the faithful ones, and Paul said my family gives me an asset that my name has
[time=2907] value and my name brings a ring of loyalty to God.
[time=2912] And his third asset is that he was of the tribe of Benjamin, but he later discovered
[time=2920] that his name could not save him.
[time=2923] The name Paul of Tarsus, the name Paul, a student of Gamelia, the name Paul who could
[time=2930] translate all the way back, name after name, name after name, and trace his ancestry back to Benjamin.
[time=2937] His name could not save him.
[time=2939] For the scripture says there is salvation and no other name.
[time=2942] Neither is there another name given under heaven by which men must, the imperative must
[time=2950] be saved than the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2955] Paul's assets are turning into liabilities, circumcised the eighth day, born of the stock
[time=2961] of Israel, born of the tribe of Benjamin, his fourth asset is also inherited.
[time=2969] He said I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews, now Paul was proud of his religion.
[time=2976] He's been proud of his ritual, he's been proud of his nationality, he's been proud of his family, now he turns with pride to his religion.
[time=2985] He was a Hebrew born individual, born of Israel, born of Benjamin, but he said I am a Hebrew
[time=2992] of the Hebrews.
[time=2993] What he is saying is I'm not just a Hebrew by birth, I am a Hebrew by my faith that distinguished
[time=2999] him in two ways, it distinguished him religiously in that there were Hebrews by birth who were
[time=3005] apostates, they had turned away from the word of God and Paul said I am sticking to the religion of my fathers and he was proud of his religion, but also distinguished him from
[time=3016] late converts in life, proselytes, Gentiles who believed in God and feared the Lord and
[time=3023] trusted in his word who converted themselves to Jews and Paul said oh while there are proselytes
[time=3030] I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews, he was proud of his religion.
[time=3036] He believed that by his religion he would be saved and there are those today that believe that their religion will save them.
[time=3044] There are Catholics who believe that because they are Catholics they will go to heaven and they're proud of the history of their church and they can trace their ancestry back to Peter.
[time=3055] They're those that are Lutherans today who are proud of their church and they're proud of Martin Luther that in 1517 at 749 a.m. on October the 30th that he nailed his theses
[time=3068] on the door.
[time=3069] We had to learn the date, the hour and the moment.
[time=3070] I had a Lutheran for a history teacher, they're proud of that, do you know they're a Baptist
[time=3077] today that they're proud that they're Baptist and they believe that being a Baptist and a member of this church or another Baptist church will save them?
[time=3085] Oh men and women whether you be Baptist, Lutheran, Catholic, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, no religion
[time=3092] can save you.
[time=3094] Religion is man's outward expression even sometimes his own attempt to reach God and
[time=3100] no religion can reach God.
[time=3102] Only God can reach down to man and save him.
[time=3106] Church membership cannot save you.
[time=3108] Oh don't be proud of your religion, don't have confidence in the flesh, it cannot save
[time=3114] you this morning, it cannot save you.
[time=3117] A story is told and I'll tell it against us this morning who are Baptist.
[time=3122] About this Baptist who died and was getting a tour of heaven and he was placed in one particular area and then another man died and went to heaven and Peter was giving him a tour also and as he gave this man a tour through heaven, they came to this wall and
[time=3138] Peter leaned over to the man and said, "Shh, don't talk now." And the man said, "Well what's the problem?" Peter said, "Well you see this wall, it divides heaven into two.
[time=3147] Most of us are over here but the Baptists are over there and we put this wall up because they think they're the only ones that are here.
[time=3154] Are Baptists the only ones in heaven?
[time=3156] No they're not.
[time=3158] Are Catholics?
[time=3159] No they're not.
[time=3160] Are Lutherans?
[time=3161] No.
[time=3162] Does church membership give you an asset that you can be saved?
[time=3166] It does not.
[time=3167] Paul said if any man could boast of that which he possesses, I could boast of my religion.
[time=3172] I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews but he found that he had no confidence in the flesh.
[time=3179] His fifth asset as touching the law of Pharisee, he was proud of his devotion.
[time=3188] He was proud of his devotion.
[time=3190] Now when you and I think of Pharisee, we think of an evil person.
[time=3194] You're locked into the gospels and it was the Pharisees that persecuted Christ.
[time=3198] It was the Pharisees that put him to death and it's the Pharisees that Jesus Christ announces time and time again.
[time=3205] But don't misunderstand.
[time=3207] These were good men.
[time=3209] These were moral men.
[time=3210] These were men of great devotion and sincerity.
[time=3213] I'm humored by their beliefs.
[time=3216] Their devotion to honoring the law was so particular.
[time=3219] Then Pharisee taught that it was all right for a lady to wash dishes on the Sabbath.
[time=3225] That was not work.
[time=3226] I'm sorry to disappoint you today ladies but they taught that that was not work.
[time=3230] But to throw the water, for the man to throw the water out of the window, that was work.
[time=3235] Because you see the water could hit the ground, land on the seed and cause the seed to grow and everyone knows that that's work.
[time=3242] So men as your wife forces the dishes today, that's all right.
[time=3246] But don't you pull the drain, okay?
[time=3248] We don't want you to work this day.
[time=3251] That was the kind of people they were.
[time=3252] They were so sincere in their devotion.
[time=3254] They didn't want to violate the law.
[time=3257] They were tremendously sincere people, self-persecuting to the point of obeying the law.
[time=3262] But Paul saying is here is that sincerity does not save you.
[time=3268] Do you know that you can be sincere and you can have the right attitude but you can be
[time=3274] sincerely wrong?
[time=3276] I believe that the pilot of that jet that left Washington DC flight 90 that crashed in the
[time=3283] Potomac sincerely believed that he was going to make it.
[time=3288] But sincerity did not lift that plane off the ground.
[time=3291] Why?
[time=3292] Because it was in violation of the laws of nature.
[time=3296] There was not enough thrust and left to compensate for the pull of gravity and the force of the drag in the plane crashed because it violated the law of nature.
[time=3307] Men and women, we can violate the law of scripture and trust in sincerity and be sincerely
[time=3314] wrong this morning and die in our sins because sincerity saves no one unless their sincerity
[time=3321] is placed in a valid object.
[time=3324] You might sincerely believe today that you can make it through this blizzard.
[time=3328] You might be sincerely wrong.
[time=3330] You trust it in a car that could not make it.
[time=3333] What can you trust in today that can save you?
[time=3336] Jesus Christ.
[time=3337] You can trust him today and he can save you.
[time=3341] Paul's next asset concerning zeal, persecuting the church.
[time=3347] Now he is proud of his enthusiasm.
[time=3350] Paul said I was not only a Jew and not only a Pharisee, I was enthusiastic.
[time=3354] I was zealous.
[time=3355] I was intensely involved.
[time=3359] You may think that enthusiasm today merits you favor in God.
[time=3363] You may sing in the choir.
[time=3365] You didn't today.
[time=3366] They didn't make it.
[time=3367] But you may be a Sunday school teacher in your church.
[time=3369] You may be a pastor this morning.
[time=3371] You may be a priest and be sincere and enthusiastic.
[time=3377] You can be enthusiastically unsaved.
[time=3380] Jim Kennedy of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church tells of their evangelism explosion program
[time=3386] and how pastors and priests come from all over the nation to be trained in evangelism.
[time=3391] And they're seeking that they might win others to the loss they discover that they themselves
[time=3397] are lost.
[time=3398] Are they enthusiastic?
[time=3400] Yes.
[time=3401] Are they zealous?
[time=3402] Yes they are.
[time=3403] Are they lost?
[time=3404] Yes.
[time=3406] John Wesley came to this country from England as a missionary to the savages into the colonists.
[time=3413] And he left frustrated in despair, not knowing where he was spiritually.
[time=3417] He got aboard a boat in Georgia and sailed home to England in a great storm.
[time=3422] Maybe a storm like today blew up.
[time=3424] And he feared for his life in the whole of the ship and in another area of the ship, a group of Moravian missionaries sang praises with great confidence.
[time=3433] And in anguish in his soul he said, "How can I fear for my life?" And they'd be so confident.
[time=3438] What do they have that I don't have?
[time=3440] And he began a search.
[time=3441] And he went to Alder's Dig Chapel in London.
[time=3444] And there John Wesley, the missionary for the first time received Christ as Savior.
[time=3450] Oh, men and women, you may be a member of a church, a deacon of on the board.
[time=3454] You may serve faithfully in Sunday school, but you may be trusting today in your enthusiasm.
[time=3460] Enthusiasm can save no one.
[time=3464] Paul's last asset concerning the law, blameless.
[time=3468] Paul was proud of his morality.
[time=3471] You may be a moral person today.
[time=3473] You may think that other people are sinners, but you and I are sinners.
[time=3478] When Paul added up all of his assets, they are a loss.
[time=3483] He has net worth with zero until he received Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=3490] This morning right where you are in prayer, I invite you right now to bow your head and to say this simple prayer, Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[time=3499] Come into my life and be my Savior.
[time=3502] He will come in.
[time=3504] Shall we pray together?
[time=3506] Our Father this morning.
