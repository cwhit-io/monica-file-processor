[time=30] >>Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=39] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=46] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=57] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=63] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=74] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=84] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=94] >>Good morning and welcome.
[time=95] We are delighted to be here this morning and to see this auditorium filling up.
[time=101] First hour we had a good full service, which is strange for this year.
[time=106] As a matter of fact, this is the first Sunday since January the third.
[time=110] We've had two services.
[time=112] As you who I see here this morning joined us last week for the Bible Hour because we had a blizzard of tremendous proportions that completely shut down our city.
[time=122] As a matter of fact, we crowded everybody into one service and into about three rows of that one service last week.
[time=129] We're delighted that you are here and are delighted that we have our friends joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=135] I'm looking forward to sharing with you profit and loss.
[time=139] I believe it will be a challenge for each of us to take an audit and an inventory of what Jesus Christ means in our life today.
[time=148] But before we do that, God has got some special music lined up for us and He is going to bless us through the ministry of music.
[time=155] Don Kruger is now directing our choir.
[time=158] He'll be singing for us a little later on.
[time=160] We'll hear from the men singers and we'll also hear from Lenna Peterson music that tunes our hearts to sing the praises of our risen Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=170] The choir sings for us now.
[time=172] God comes in love.
[time=212] He comes in love as we turn our hearts on.
[time=222] God comes in power.
[time=227] God comes our weak and empty lives to empower.
[time=232] God comes to fill them with sustaining praise.
[time=236] God comes in love.
[time=249] He comes in love as we turn our hearts on.
[time=362] Thank you, choir.
[time=363] There are a few key words out of the Bible that speak to us directly about God's relationship to man.
[time=370] And love perhaps is one of the very best of those.
[time=374] The Bible says that for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[time=379] But another word that describes God's love and relationship towards man is the word grace.
[time=385] Don Krueger sings for us now about the grace of God, a song entitled "Marvelous Grace."
[time=393] [MUSIC]
[time=407] Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
[time=423] yonder on cavalry's mount, outboard, there where the blood of the lamb was spilled.
[time=443] Grace grace, God's grace, grace that we'll part on.
[time=456] Twelve within grace grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[time=480] [MUSIC]
[time=488] Dark is the stake that we cannot hide, what shell of ale to wash it away.
[time=505] The look there is flowing, a craze inside, wider than snow.
[time=517] You may be today, grace grace, God's grace, grace that we'll part on.
[time=534] And cleanse within grace grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin.
[time=559] The grace of God is something that God gives to us, even though we don't deserve it.
[time=565] It's different than mercy, mercy is something that God withholds from us, that we deserve.
[time=572] In other words, hell should be ours, but God withholds it from us by His mercy.
[time=577] Heaven shouldn't be ours, but because of His grace, He freely gives it to us.
[time=585] And if you are longing to see His face, you can this moment His grace receive.
[time=609] Grace grace, God's grace grace that we'll part on.
[time=622] And cleanse within grace grace, God's grace grace that is greater than all our sin.
[time=651] Grace grace.
[time=663] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=665] We're so thankful that you've joined us.
[time=667] I have my good friend Don Kruger with me.
[time=669] Good morning, Don.
[time=670] Good morning, Rick.
[time=671] It's been a delight for us, these past snowy cold weekends, to share the word of God in the ministry of music with you through television.
[time=679] Because of the bad weather, many people who regularly attend church were not able to get to their church, and they stayed at home and watched the Bible Hour with us.
[time=688] We've heard from many of them letters of encouragement and requests.
[time=692] Don, you have one to share with us, I believe.
[time=694] This letter says, "Dear Pastor Rick, we want to say we really enjoyed your program this morning.
[time=700] We want to say thank you again and again.
[time=703] We haven't been able to go to church for the entire month of January, would you please send me a copy of Timeless Insights?"
[time=710] And I suppose we've gotten numerous amount of letters like this.
[time=713] Well, I've got one just like that to share with you.
[time=716] Dear Pastor Rick, I was home from church because of the weather, and I happened to listen to your program.
[time=723] Your offer of Timeless Insights is a devotional that I have been looking for.
[time=728] Please send me a copy.
[time=730] Many of the people who normally attend church were able to see the Bible Hour, and it was such an encouragement to them they wrote to us.
[time=737] And we do appreciate that.
[time=739] And as they wrote, most of them requested the booklet, Timeless Insights, a daily devotional guide that takes you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=749] Don, why don't you share a little bit about that with our friends?
[time=752] Well, I have been sharing the last couple of weeks, Pastor Rick, this little devotional guide, Timeless Insights, and I have a confession to make.
[time=759] I wasn't using it myself to this past week, and just looking through it and thumbing through it to get an idea of what it was like.
[time=766] But this last week, I used it as a devotional guide, and it is a tremendous one.
[time=770] I want to hardly recommend it to you.
[time=772] At the beginning, there's an introduction, a two-page introduction, on the book of Acts, and that's what this particular month's Timeless Insight guide
[time=781] is concerned with, the book of Acts.
[time=784] And the way it happens is you have a chapter, and every day gives you a new chapter, and then some comments on the chapter,
[time=792] and then a timeless insight from some great man of God, like Martin Luther or Spurgeon, or I don't know if your name is in here, Pastor Rick.
[time=801] I don't believe it is.
[time=802] Well, anyway, great men who have gone on before and have written commentaries have little thoughts on what that portion of Scripture in the book of Acts has to say.
[time=812] It's a tremendous little book, and I would like to recommend it.
[time=816] If you'd like one of these copies, send to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=825] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we'll send you one of your copies of Timeless Insights.
[time=834] You will really enjoy this, and I recommend it.
[time=837] Don, my name is not in there, because they usually wait until someone's much older.
[time=841] About your age, we'll probably start seeing people in there about that age.
[time=846] Don's a good friend, and we love to tease him.
[time=848] He's much younger than his hair looks, but boy is he in shape.
[time=852] He's a fine minister of music and a good friend, and I'm so thankful that he could share with you the ministry of Timeless Insights today.
[time=860] We've received many requests from this for this booklet, and we hope that you'll write requesting it today.
[time=866] We have a new guest with us today.
[time=868] Her name is Debbie Newen-Swander, and Debbie is our assistant producer of the Bible Hour.
[time=873] Along with that, Debbie handles all of our office coordination, and she has some thoughts to share with us today.
[time=879] Good morning. Each day, we receive many pieces of mail from our Bible Hour viewers.
[time=885] Because they think of the Bible Hour as our home church, many of them ask spiritual questions, and one that we've received many, many times reads, "Is it necessary for a person to be baptized to be a true Christian and to go to heaven?"
[time=898] What do you think about that, Pastor Rick?
[time=900] Well, Debbie, that's an excellent question, because baptism is a very, very important issue in the scriptures.
[time=907] As a matter of fact, when Jesus Christ gave the great commission, he commanded the church to baptize people.
[time=914] So baptism is very important.
[time=916] However, I believe that there are those who are confused about how important baptism is and mislead and think that baptism is essential in order for an individual to go to heaven.
[time=928] I believe that is not true. Although baptism is important, it is not necessary for an individual to be baptized to go to heaven.
[time=937] Let me explain to you how we come to that conclusion.
[time=940] First of all, here's a good principle for you to apply when you're trying to understand the Bible.
[time=946] Always interpret the clear passages of Scripture by examining them and using them as a guide to interpret the unclear.
[time=958] Now, let me illustrate that with this particular problem.
[time=961] There are a few verses that very closely link baptism to salvation.
[time=965] However, there are hundreds of verses that declare that salvation is by faith alone and there's no reference to baptism.
[time=973] For example, John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world that he gave us only begotten Son, that whosoever would believe have faith in him should not perish but have everlasting life."
[time=985] Romans chapter 10, "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." These two and countless other references tell us that salvation is by faith alone.
[time=995] These are clear passages.
[time=997] There are perhaps two or three passages in the Bible that are not quite as clear and baptism is closely linked to salvation.
[time=1006] Let me share one with you.
[time=1008] It comes from the Gospel of Mark and Jesus speaks and he says in Mark chapter 16 verse 15,
[time=1016] "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
[time=1021] He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." Now there's a passage that makes it sound like you must be baptized.
[time=1028] But if you keep reading, you'll find the answer.
[time=1030] "He that believe and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned."
[time=1037] Now notice that Mark was saying that baptism is important, that baptism logically follows faith.
[time=1043] But the thing that separates the lost from the saved is simply their faith because it goes on to say,
[time=1049] "He that believes not is damned, not he that is not baptized." So what we need to do is first examine the clear passages that teach it salvation is by faith alone
[time=1060] and use those clear passages for our theology.
[time=1063] And that will help us to understand an unclear passage.
[time=1066] And here the context tells us that salvation is by faith and baptism is important,
[time=1072] but it's not baptism that determines whether a person is lost or on the text "damned."
[time=1078] Baptism is important. Church attendance is important.
[time=1082] We're so thankful that you've joined us today.
[time=1084] But we hope that each Sunday you make a special effort to get to your church and when you can't.
[time=1089] Thank you for joining the Bible Hour.
[time=1091] We'd love to hear from you today and to send you timeless insights.
[time=1094] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1100] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1103] God bless you and we're looking forward to sharing the rest of our worship service with you now.
[time=1125] It is much when God is in it, labor not for wealth or faith.
[time=1139] There is a crown and you can win it.
[time=1146] If you go in Jesus' name, does a play sure called to labor
[time=1164] seem so small and little no?
[time=1171] Well, it is great if God is in it.
[time=1178] And he'll not forget his own.
[time=1185] In this much when God is in it, labor not for wealth or faith.
[time=1199] There is a crown and you can win it.
[time=1207] If you go in Jesus' name.
[time=1217] When our conflict here is in it, and our race on earth is run.
[time=1231] He will say if we are faithful, welcome home.
[time=1241] My child will die.
[time=1246] Little is watched when God is in it, labor not for wealth or faith.
[time=1260] There is a crown and you can win it.
[time=1267] If you go in Jesus' name, there is a crown and you can win it.
[time=1282] If you go, if you go in Jesus' name.
[time=1302] I like those songs with four-part harmony because I can always sing along.
[time=1313] I'll be with the tenor, one part and the bass and other in between every now and then.
[time=1319] But that's good music that tells us about the Lord Jesus Christ and his ability to take our life, even when there is just a little, and we find that there is great reward because he is in it.
[time=1330] Little is much when Jesus is in it.
[time=1334] Over the years, a young man with a tremendous ability to write music by the name of Andre Crouch has written a number of songs.
[time=1341] Perhaps the one that is most familiar, ministers the strongest, is a song entitled My Tribute.
[time=1348] How can I say thanks for the great things that God has done for me?
[time=1354] That a Peterson sings for us now. My Tribute.
[time=1365] How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me?
[time=1378] The things so undeserved, yet you gave to prove your love for all.
[time=1390] The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude.
[time=1402] All that I am, or ever hope to be.
[time=1411] I owe it all to thee.
[time=1418] To God be the glory, to God be the glory, to God be the glory.
[time=1436] For the things he has done, for with his blood he has saved me.
[time=1449] To God be the glory, for the things he has done.
[time=1469] Oh, I must leave my life, but let it be pleasing, Lord, to thee.
[time=1483] And should there be any praise, that it go to give a ring?
[time=1497] Come away, for with his blood he has saved me.
[time=1507] When his blood he has raised me, to God be the glory, for the things he has done.
[time=1536] Thank you, and that will long ring in our hearts, an attitude of unability to praise God for the things that he has done for us.
[time=1550] Let us begin by humbling ourselves and praying to God, asking him to take control of our hour and of our lives.
[time=1559] Father, we bow before you, with a humble heart, and with a thankful heart for the great things you have done for us in Christ Jesus.
[time=1567] Father, it is our prayer this morning, that as we open your word, we would not see a man or the philosophies of man, but that we would see Jesus Christ, him crucified and alive, reigning within our hearts.
[time=1581] For it is in his name we pray, amen. In the year 1869, September the 24th stands out as a red letter date called Black Friday.
[time=1594] Two men, one by the name of J. Gould, the other James Fish Junior, tried to develop a corner on the gold market.
[time=1602] What they did was to take much of their resources and finance them through a bank, turn the cash that they received, then into gold by purchasing gold on the open market.
[time=1615] They were so successful that they actually developed a corner on the market.
[time=1620] Because of that, they were able to control the gold prices, and the value of gold simply climbed and climbed and climbed every day.
[time=1628] Because the common market expected that gold prices would continue to escalate, individuals of little means went out, they mortgaged their homes, their furniture, everything they could possess at a bank, took the cash and invested it in gold.
[time=1645] However, it was such a problem of a panic in 1869. The United States Treasury opened up some of the gold that they had and sold it on the market, and the gold prices crashed, having tumbled down.
[time=1661] As a result of that, thousands of people who believed that gold was their greatest asset discovered it to be their greatest liability because they could not sell their gold back for anywhere near the price that they had borrowed money to purchase it with.
[time=1679] Their asset was now their greatest liability. During the roaring 20s, the commodities of stock rose in prominence and prestige, and individuals began to see high returns on their investments.
[time=1695] And once again, the same pattern took place. People without any liquid assets mortgaged their houses, their furniture, everything they could at a bank to take their cash and turn it into stocks.
[time=1708] The stock market began to show weakness on October the 24th, 1929, and the weakness started a panic, and instead of intense buying, there was intense selling, and five days later, October the 29th, 1929, the stock market crashed, sending this country into the greatest depression of its history.
[time=1732] And once again, people found that their assets, their stock, became their greatest liability because they could not sell their stock for near the money they had bought it for, and now they had a home, and a furniture, and all of their possessions as a liability with no ability to pay off those loans.
[time=1756] They were times in our life, and the things that we trust in as our assets turn out to be our greatest liabilities.
[time=1765] That not only happens in the financial arenas of life, but it happens spiritually too.
[time=1771] There are those today that believe they have great assets in their relationship with God, but they're going to discover at some point that their assets are their greatest liability.
[time=1784] One such individual was the Apostle Paul.
[time=1787] I invite you to open your Bibles with me if you will to Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1792] And then last week we studied some of the key verses of Paul's former assets in verses 4, 5, and 6 of Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1803] Today we turn our attention to Paul's liabilities and his new asset, Christ Jesus.
[time=1809] But let's begin by examining the text, and I shall read for you beginning with verse 4 through verse 9 of Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1819] Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any other man thinks that he has reasons for which he might trust in the flesh, I more.
[time=1831] Circumcised the eighth day of the stock of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee, concerning zeal, persecuting the church,
[time=1849] touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gained to me those I count for loss for Christ.
[time=1864] Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but refuse, that I may win Christ and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law.
[time=1887] But that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
[time=1896] Earlier in this particular chapter Paul writes a word of warning, a warning against the satanic influence of legalists and Judaizers.
[time=1907] Those who were teaching not to trust in Christ alone for salvation, but those who were teaching Christ plus works and Paul writes to his audience and he says, beware.
[time=1918] He calls them dogs and evil workers and men of mutilation, then he defines true faith in verse three, those who worship God in their hearts, those who do not boast in what they have done but those who have boasting and confidence in Christ Jesus alone.
[time=1937] And then finally, those who have no confidence in the flesh. Then Paul says in verse four, if there was ever a man, Paul said, who by the character and the conduct of his life could please God in his flesh, Paul says I am the man.
[time=1955] And he begins to list that which he thought to be assets, verses five and six. Paul was proud of his ceremony. He was circumcised the eight day, a tremendous asset in his esteem.
[time=1968] Paul was of the stock of Israel. He was not a proselyte. He was a born son of Israel. Moreover, he was of the tribe of Benjamin. He had the right family.
[time=1979] He came from the tribe of Benjamin. He was some of the notoriety of the day. It was the tribe of Benjamin that remained loyal when the nation went apostate. It was the tribe of Benjamin from which King Saul arose.
[time=1995] It was the tribe of Benjamin and the house and lineage of David of which the Messiah was predicted. Oh, to be of the right family. Certainly that merited favor in God's eyes, thought Paul.
[time=2007] He was not only proud of those things, but he was proud of his religion. He was a Hebrew born of the Hebrews. He had the right religion because it was the Hebrews that were the recipients of the oracles of God.
[time=2022] He had the right religion and he was sure that that pleased God. Not only did he have the right religion, but he had the right devotion.
[time=2030] He was a Pharisee, a meticulous observer of the traditions of his nation. He was devoted. More than devoted. He was enthusiastic. He was a zealot.
[time=2042] He was so concerned about the purity of the Jewish faith that he persecuted all who opposed, particularly the Church of Jesus Christ. And then finally he was proud of his morality. He was a moral man. He was an upright man. He could declare himself blameless.
[time=2059] And Paul said if there was ever an individual who could please God, then I'm the man. Perhaps this morning you view some things as assets in your life. You were baptized as an infant. You believe that's an asset that God will merit as beneficial to you.
[time=2078] Perhaps you were born of the right tradition. You may be sitting here this morning saying I've always been a Christian. You may be an intensely moral person. You may be able to say with Paul, I have confidence in the flesh.
[time=2094] But men and women, there was a day in Paul's life where he discovered that he didn't have any assets. That his assets were liabilities. The things that he trusted in to secure him in a right relationship with God were loss.
[time=2110] One day on the road to Damascus, he was struck down by a bright light. And he asked two questions. Question one, who art thou Lord? The answer? I am Jesus, whom thou persecuted. Question two, what will thou have me to do?
[time=2130] God gave him the instructions to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and to serve him. That took everyone of Paul's assets and made them a liability.
[time=2142] He lists for us at least two liabilities. The first liability, verse seven, those things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ. His first liability is his past attempt to please God.
[time=2161] And he's referring to those seven things. His ritual, his nationality, his family, his religion, his devotion, his enthusiasm and his morality. And he says I count them all but lost. Paul was saying my religion cannot make me right with God.
[time=2180] I believe Fritz Rittenauer's correctly defined religion as man's attempt to reach up to God. And by that definition, Christianity is not a religion. For Christianity is not man reaching out to God. It is God in love reaching down to man.
[time=2200] Paul's religion could not save him. Neither could his good works. All the things that he'd accomplished is a Pharisee. All the prominence of his moral conduct could not please God.
[time=2214] There is a great deal of confusion about the relationship of good works to salvation. One group misperceived and they believe they must do good works in order to be saved.
[time=2226] That was the apostle Paul before he met Jesus Christ. There's another group about whom Paul's writing now. Those are those who believe that they have Christ, but in order to be truly saved, they must obey the Jewish law and perform those good deeds and they boast in the flesh.
[time=2246] Paul is saying that good works cannot save you. All that he was in terms of his morality could not save him. Believe it is the navigators that use a bridge illustration.
[time=2258] An illustration where if you can picture one mountain over here and man isolated on that mountain and a second mountain over here and God isolated on that mountain and an inseparable valley between them, a valley that keeps them completely apart.
[time=2275] And so man begins to try to build bridges across to God. And one bridge is religion, but man's religion cannot reach up to God when the God can reach across to man.
[time=2286] Another bridge would be the bridge of good works. And someone may build a bridge that goes this far because they're not a very moral person.
[time=2295] But another bridge may go this far and they may come far closer to God because they're much more moral and they build a longer bridge.
[time=2303] The scripture teaches there's not a man that can build a bridge long enough to reach God because the wages of a sin is death.
[time=2312] And James tells us, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law yet offended one point is guilty of all."
[time=2320] Jesus said, "Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees, you shall know why see the kingdom of God."
[time=2330] There are those that believe that they're bridge because it's better than the next person's bridge is going to get them there.
[time=2337] Perhaps the illustration of a long jumper would help you.
[time=2341] I swam competitively in high school and when the season ended, I usually worked out with the track team. And you had to declare one event as your major emphasis.
[time=2350] And I wasn't about to declare it the mile or the two mile. I said, "I'm a long jumper. I couldn't long jump, but that's what I wanted to do."
[time=2358] We went to this big invitational meet. And we were all concerned, could we set the record? Could we make it as far as the person who had done the best?
[time=2367] And the man said, "Well, no one knows how far the best is because the person that set the record jumped over the pit."
[time=2374] You may have heard of him. His name was Paul Warfield.
[time=2377] And we began to see that there was a standard we could not match.
[time=2381] But now there's another individual who can long jump further than Paul Warfield.
[time=2385] Bob Beaman has jumped 29 feet two and a half inches to set the world's record.
[time=2391] He can jump much further than you or I or any other human. But men and women, if the event is to long jump from the shores of California to Hawaii, Bob Beaman will make it further than I will.
[time=2404] Paul Warfield will make it further. Some of you will, but no one will long jump to Hawaii.
[time=2411] And while some people may come either conducted morality much closer to a godly life, no one will approximate the life that God demands through good works.
[time=2422] And Paul said, "My religion and my good works are laws. I have counted my past efforts to please God as a complete failure, as a complete loss.
[time=2434] Religion is a good thing. But even a good thing can become a bad thing if it keeps you from the best thing.
[time=2442] A man's religion can damn his soul if it keeps him from Jesus Christ."
[time=2449] So Paul says his first liability was this, his past efforts to make himself right with God.
[time=2458] Verse 8, "Yay doubtlessly." This is a term of emphasis. This is an emphatic punch there.
[time=2464] He's saying, "Moreover, more than my past efforts," he says, "and I now count all things but loss."
[time=2473] Notice the change in verb tense from verse 7 to 8. Verse 7, "I counted past tense."
[time=2482] Verse 8, "I am counting, present tense." So Paul's second liability is his present efforts to serve God.
[time=2493] Paul was saying this, that even though he now trusted in Christ, the things that he had accomplished for God did not make him right with God.
[time=2503] Never confuse service for God to standing justified with God.
[time=2511] Our good works on this side of salvation do not merit a standing before God.
[time=2518] And here was the great apostle who had gone on three missionary journeys.
[time=2522] The man who had been imprisoned many times for Christ, the individual who had been physically abused, stoned unto death for Christ,
[time=2530] he said, "They count as loss. I count them as loss." Here was the man who planted more churches than any other apostle, both in Asia and in Europe.
[time=2540] He said, "I count them loss. They're nothing." As a matter of fact, he says, "I call them refuge, done, maneuver to be discarded."
[time=2550] That which is only fitting to throw the dogs the waste.
[time=2554] Paul says that there is no liability in human effort, whether it be the lost individual trying to please God by the character of his life
[time=2564] or the saved individual trying to please God today.
[time=2568] Louis Berry Shafer was asked what he would say if God asked him a reason for entrance to heaven.
[time=2575] Shafer said, "I would simply say Jesus Christ alone." The man said, "But wouldn't you say that you're the founder of Dallas Theological Seminary?" Shafer said, "That's a loss. Counts for nothing." The man said, "But you're an avid church girl or a Bible teacher and a pastor. Doesn't that count?" He said, "It's all loss. The only thing I can count on is Jesus Christ."
[time=2600] And what Paul was saying is two things to us.
[time=2603] If we're trusting in our good life to save us, it's not an asset. It's a liability.
[time=2609] The second thing is he's saying is once we've received Christ, we can add nothing to that position.
[time=2616] Oh, we're to serve God. We're to be moral. We're to be light and salt.
[time=2620] That does not add to our standing before God.
[time=2625] When Paul takes an inventory and he audits the books, he adds up his past assets and his liabilities.
[time=2634] He discovers that his net worth is zero. Nothing.
[time=2640] And he cries out to Timothy, "Oh, Timothy, I am the chief of sinners."
[time=2648] Men and women, if Paul could not earn a right standing before God,
[time=2654] we must fairly conclude that neither shall you or I.
[time=2659] Then what asset is it that a man can possess that can make him right with God?
[time=2665] For the rest of this chapter, verses 8 through 21, Paul is going to outline one asset with five benefits.
[time=2673] The asset, Jesus Christ. His name, our reference to him, comes up 17 times in this remaining chapter
[time=2682] because Paul is consumed with one thing, Jesus Christ and him alone.
[time=2687] But he's going to outline for us five benefits. This morning, we will discuss two of those benefits.
[time=2693] The first benefit, we will discover in verse 8.
[time=2697] Yay, doubtlessly I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord,
[time=2704] for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them, but done that I may win Christ.
[time=2711] The first asset is the knowledge of Christ.
[time=2715] Now, when the Bible speaks of the knowledge of Christ, I believe it speaks with three different levels of knowledge.
[time=2721] The first, I will call it preparatory knowledge. That is intellectual data that you may possess today.
[time=2728] You may intellectually understand that God became a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2733] You may intellectually agree with the fact that Jesus was not a man, he was not a lunatic, he was not a liar, he was the Lord God in human form.
[time=2742] That can be an intellectual fact that you will give a cent to today.
[time=2748] You may believe today in a preparatory way of knowledge that Jesus Christ lived a morally perfect life because he was not man, he was God, and that he died.
[time=2757] You may even believe this morning that he died for your sins.
[time=2761] You may believe in the miracle of the resurrection that Jesus Christ was not resuscitated, he was actually dead and God raised him up.
[time=2768] But you can believe all that this morning and not be saved because it is simply preparatory knowledge.
[time=2775] Knowledge that you need to prepare your mind and heart to be saved, but it lacks the second type of knowledge, which is personal knowledge.
[time=2785] The word Genosco, knowledge in Greek often means a knowledge by experience.
[time=2792] Far more than intellectual fact, it means to know personally.
[time=2798] I grew up in a tremendous home, godly parents, but none of us knew Christ personally.
[time=2804] We had great preparatory knowledge. I was baptized as an infant, I had ritual.
[time=2809] I was raised as a Christian in terms of a general concept. I had the right religion. I knew the right facts, but I lacked one thing.
[time=2818] I didn't know God personally.
[time=2820] I was like Thomas who heard the facts that Jesus Christ was alive and that he arose and who didn't believe.
[time=2827] But there came a day in Thomas life when Christ appeared unto him and he fell down in humility and said, "My Lord and my God, he made it personal."
[time=2837] That's what Paul's saying in this passage. He said, "Christ Jesus, my Lord."
[time=2843] It was a personal knowledge that encounter on the road to Damascus, brought the facts of Christ, personal, and you receive Christ by faith.
[time=2852] But there's a third type of knowledge and I really believe more than any of the other two.
[time=2856] This is the knowledge that Paul's referring to. I call it a progressive knowledge.
[time=2861] Do you know that when you come to know Christ as Savior, that is not the culmination of your spiritual quest?
[time=2868] It is the beginning. You have been born again. You have not been made dead. You've been made alive that you might live, that you might grow.
[time=2876] And so the pastor apostle Peter writes and he said that you might grow in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2885] The trouble with so many Christians is they're like a little boy who fell out of bed. And when his mother asked what happened, he gave this answer.
[time=2893] I stayed too close to where I got in. Many Christians are staying too close to where they got in.
[time=2902] They've received Christ. They've got him in their heart. But they haven't grown. They haven't progressed.
[time=2908] And so that asset remains stagnant. Yes, they are saved. But there's no growth because there's no accumulation of knowledge.
[time=2915] There's no intensity and study of the Word of God. There's no devotion in prayer. There's no conduct. There's no character. There's no service.
[time=2922] And their knowledge is stagnant. They stay too close to where they got in.
[time=2927] God's desire is not only that you would receive Christ and be saved, but his desire that you might grow.
[time=2933] That becomes a growing asset. And that's why Paul uses the superlative adjective that I might have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[time=2943] So many wrongly think of salvation today as fire insurance. I'll get saved. That'll protect me from the fire of hell.
[time=2953] But they don't know. It's an excellent way to live knowledge in Christ. And Paul says Christ is my asset.
[time=2961] And one of the benefits is knowing him. And he says I not only want to know him. I want to grow. I want to progress.
[time=2966] That I might win Christ. Was he speaking of salvation? No, he was not.
[time=2972] It was Paul who said back in chapter 1 verse 6, "I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you and me, he will continue it."
[time=2982] Until the day Jesus Christ comes, he was not fearing a loss of salvation. He was saying that I hunger and I strive like an athlete that I might win all that Christ is.
[time=2992] Oh, don't stay too close to where you got in. Paul's asset, Jesus Christ, the first benefit, knowledge, excellency of knowledge of Christ Jesus.
[time=3004] The second benefit we find in verse 9, "And that I might be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is of faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by faith."
[time=3025] Paul's second benefit was that in Christ he received the righteousness of God. God made an unbelievable transaction.
[time=3036] He traded all of our sins for all of Christ's righteousness. Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 5, 21 these words, "He Christ who knew no sin became sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God."
[time=3052] To give you an idea of how phenomenal that is, could you imagine if some of the major retailers where you have a credit card, J.C. Penney, Sears and Robuck, LS Air, Hudson's, all of the people who you've charged gasoline on, your master curse card, and all those other nice commodities you have, if all of your creditors called you and said, "If we changed our policy and all the people who now owe us money, however much money they owe us,
[time=3081] we're saying we owe them, and we want you to come in and pick out the merchandise of your choice." Now, just suppose that you had $400 charged at Penney's, and the manager of J.C. Penney's Glen Brook, Mr. Steidel, called you and said, "You've got $430 charged, and we switched all of our books around, and now you have $400 worth of credit. Come in and pick up your merchandise, please, whatever you'd like. You'd be mad. You'd be mad that you didn't charge $1,000 at that store."
[time=3109] Now, do you say, "That's ridiculous. No business can do that." But you know, that's how much God loves you today, that He took all of your sins.
[time=3118] And He took all the righteousness in Christ, and He made a transaction that we can have the righteousness of God imputed to us today, given to us.
[time=3130] And the books of our sin have been canceled for eternity, and the righteousness of God placed in its debt, if we will simply be found in Him.
[time=3138] By receiving Christ. And Paul tells us how we do that. We do that by faith.
[time=3144] But you know, the word "righteousness" means more than simply the forgiveness of sins.
[time=3149] We are in Christ. That means that we're cocks. You, every one of you who have received Christ, are now part of the body of Christ.
[time=3160] You're eternally linked with Him. He is the vine, and you are the branches for Corinthians.
[time=3167] Chapter 12, verse 13 says, "We are the body of Christ." And because we are eternally linked with Him, God views you and I in the exact same way as He views His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3182] And Jesus tells us that the Father loves us, just as He loved Christ Himself.
[time=3189] And Colossians tells us that when we have the righteousness of God, that we are complete in Him.
[time=3196] And so we can sing with confidence this morning. Christ is all I need.
[time=3202] Christ is all I need, all I need. More than that, we are declared perfect.
[time=3211] Forever. It is not a position which we have earned, but it is a place in which we stand.
[time=3220] God has caused us to stand acceptable in the beloved.
[time=3225] We have not been righteous on our own. We have not been justified on our own.
[time=3230] We have been declared by the eternal God, righteous.
[time=3235] Does a creditor have the ability to say to the one that owes Him money your debt is canceled and you now have value?
[time=3244] Yes, He does. That is exactly what God has done for us in Christ Jesus.
[time=3249] He has declared us in a position of good standing forever.
[time=3254] Hebrews chapter 10, verse 10 tells us that the righteousness we receive in Christ is once for all.
[time=3264] Once for all. That is if we receive Christ as Savior.
[time=3270] He comes into our life and we have a permanent stand as justified as forgiven.
[time=3277] Oh, the asset in Christ Jesus to know that we can have the excellency of the knowledge of Him.
[time=3283] That we can receive the righteousness which is by faith.
[time=3287] And Paul makes such a contrast. He says, "I don't want to be found in my righteousness.
[time=3291] Not my ritual. Not my ceremony. Not my nationality. Not my religion.
[time=3296] Not the righteousness which is of the law.
[time=3299] But the righteousness which is by faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=3303] Would you receive Him this morning by faith?
[time=3307] Would you claim the eternal asset of Jesus Christ?
[time=3311] Men and women, may I be lovingly blunt this morning to say, if you're trusting in your infant baptism, it's not an asset. It's a liability.
[time=3321] If you're trusting in your religion, it's not an asset. It's a liability.
[time=3327] If you're trusting in your conduct as a moral person, it's not an asset.
[time=3332] It's a liability. Take an inventory of your life today on what are you trusting?
[time=3339] In the audit of your life, there's but one asset that is acceptable to God.
[time=3345] It's the asset of Jesus Christ.
[time=3348] Have you received Him by faith?
[time=3351] Have you opened up your heart to Him?
[time=3353] Have you registered yourself as spiritually bankrupt?
[time=3357] You might have the asset of Jesus Christ.
[time=3361] I believe so many are going to have a Black Friday in their life.
[time=3365] A day when their investment in gold ceases to be an asset.
[time=3372] It becomes a liability. And their purchase of stock commodities are not going to serve them financially.
[time=3379] They're going to be bankrupt, not bankrupt here, bankrupt before God.
[time=3386] Would you bow with us in prayer and take a spiritual inventory and audit of your life?
[time=3393] I ask you a probing question this morning.
[time=3397] What assets are you claiming before God?
[time=3400] What is it that you're trusting in that gives you a right standing with Him?
[time=3405] The word righteousness means to be in a right standing.
[time=3410] Have you received Christ as Savior?
[time=3413] Have you claimed the eternal asset which alone can save your soul?
[time=3418] Have you made Him the Lord and Savior of your life?
[time=3421] If not, in this auditorium are at home watching on television.
[time=3427] You can pray and make this simple prayer your eternal asset.
[time=3432] Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[time=3435] Be my Savior. Forgive me of my sins.
[time=3439] Give to me the righteousness of Jesus Christ and the knowledge of Him.
[time=3445] Would you open up your heart turn this morning?
[time=3448] Heal alone as your entrance to heaven.
[time=3451] No religion, no good works. Christ alone can save you.
[time=3456] Father.
