[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible, Amen.
[time=33] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=40] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=51] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=56] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Krueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Island.
[time=67] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Island musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=76] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=85] - And we extend a special welcome to our friends who've joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=92] I'm looking forward to sharing a message with you about the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, how it can be real in your life and in mine.
[time=101] But before we do that, we have some music that I know will encourage you, minister to your heart, and bring praise to our Father and to our God.
[time=110] And so our choir sings for us now, Jesus, name of all names to me.
[time=117] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=346] Music has the ability to prepare our hearts,
[time=361] also to encourage our hearts.
[time=363] This past week as I was studying for the message that you'll be hearing in just a few moments, a song came to my mind that illustrated what I was studying.
[time=372] I couldn't actually think of the name of that song and I went down to one of the secretaries who's musically inclined and I said, "Now here's a few phrases of a song.
[time=380] Does that sound familiar?" She began to hum and then another gal came up and they hummed and they came up with 04,000 tongues to sing.
[time=388] Then I went and took my hymn book and began to read that and it was really an encouragement to my heart.
[time=394] Then this morning, without even knowing it, I was sitting behind the curtain just studying and reading over some thoughts.
[time=401] When I began to hear that song, Ron, you really ministered to my heart at about 8 15 this morning when you came in and practiced in power of music to lift our heart, to sing praise.
[time=411] I'm thankful for the ministry God's given, you Ron, and for the song that John Wesley's brother Charles wrote, Charles Wesley 04,000 tongues to sing.
[time=421] Thank you, Ron, for your ministry to us today.
[time=424] [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=625] - Welcome back to the Bible Hour.
[time=639] Each week during the middle of our worship service, Don and I like to take a few moments to talk personally with our friends who watch the Bible Hour week by week.
[time=649] We certainly do count you as dear friends and appreciate your letters of support, encouragement and enthusiasm for the ministry of the Word of God and the music that we're able to share with you each week.
[time=661] Don, last night I had an opportunity to go to Fort Wayne Bible College for a delightful concert.
[time=667] When I walked in, someone walked up to me and said, "Well, hello, Snow Pastor." They've been joining us each week that they couldn't get out for church.
[time=674] But I want to take this opportunity to give you a special word of encouragement.
[time=679] And that is this.
[time=680] Make every effort you can to attend your church.
[time=684] Don't become a homebody and become lethargic during these cold winter days.
[time=689] Make every effort to be in the house of the Lord and to worship.
[time=693] But thank you for joining us today and we pray that each week we can share with you something from the Word of God that will strengthen and encourage your life.
[time=702] From time to time we share with you financial needs of the Bible Hour.
[time=706] We have put together a newsletter that we want to send to each interested party in this particular ministry.
[time=714] This newsletter is called The Scroll.
[time=717] And this month The Scroll focuses in as a special issue on the financial status of the Bible Hour.
[time=725] It includes an article which I wrote about the philosophy of a television ministry.
[time=730] Then it tells you detailed information how the money that you send is spent, where each dollar goes, how it's used, what it costs us in different areas.
[time=740] I believe it'll be a tremendous help to you to understand this particular television ministry and the need for finances.
[time=747] We would like to send you a copy of The Scroll so that you can be an informed viewer of the Bible Hour.
[time=753] Won't you write today, write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=761] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=765] The scroll is one particular piece of literature we share with a select group of people who we call the Founders Club.
[time=772] They're a very special group.
[time=773] Don, could you just take a few moments and tell our friends about the Founders Club?
[time=778] Pastor Rick, the Founders Club is a group of dedicated Christians who love the Lord and love the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=786] And they faithfully every month support the Bible Hour with their gifts.
[time=790] Sometimes the gifts are $10 and sometimes they're much more.
[time=793] But we appreciate so much the support of those of you who are Founder Club members.
[time=799] Now some of you would like to be a part of this ministry and we would like you to do that.
[time=805] If you would like to find information as to how you can be a part of the Founders Club here at the Bible Hour, please write to us at the Bible Hour box 15,00015,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=821] Now Founders Club members receive every month something from the church.
[time=825] They give to us, we give to them.
[time=827] The Founders Club members receive the scroll.
[time=831] They receive a letter from Pastor Rick.
[time=833] They receive a little watch word, something to put on the desk for every month, a little word from the word of God, a little nugget of truth.
[time=843] And then they also receive timeless insights, the new devotional guide that we've been offering from week to week.
[time=849] And now if you'd like to be a part of the Founders Club, please write.
[time=852] We'd love to have you join our team.
[time=854] That's the Bible Hour box 15,00015,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=863] - Thank you, Don.
[time=864] It is characteristic of many television ministries to have to go from crisis to crisis financially.
[time=871] We do not enjoy doing that.
[time=873] So what we have decided to try to do is to put an all-out effort to find friends who will faithfully stand behind the Bible Hour each and every month.
[time=883] We're looking for a hundred new members of our Founders Club who will support us regularly.
[time=888] Then we don't have to make special appeals on a regular basis because we're just about to go off the air.
[time=894] We're looking for people who will make an investment.
[time=897] And when you make an investment, you expect something in return, a dividend on your investment.
[time=903] We want to send those who are part of the Founders Club, a little piece of paper with some great dividends listed on it.
[time=910] That paper includes a report back from people who watched the Bible Hour and God has used this ministry to touch their life for Jesus Christ.
[time=919] We want to share that good word of dividend with you.
[time=923] Won't you join the Founders Club today?
[time=926] Write to us at the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=935] Now we hope that you'll stay with us as we share through music the life-changing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=941] What an enthusiastic minister of music we have here in Don Kruger and the choir, the Blackhawks singers, Ron Hackett, Dennis and Ron singing for us today.
[time=951] It'll thrill your heart.
[time=953] Join us for the ministry of music.
[time=955] And then today I want to share with you the greatest resource of power that you can have in your life.
[time=961] Far more powerful than just a positive attitude.
[time=964] It's the resurrection power of Jesus Christ.
[time=967] It can be a part of your life.
[time=968] Stay with us.
[time=969] (upbeat music)
[time=997] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=1213] One of the most beautiful truths in all of the scriptures is that God loves us.
[time=1219] I want you to take your hymnals now and turn in them to hymn number 111.
[time=1223] No, it's 11, and we're singing "O Worship the King." We're going to ask those who are watching on the television to join right along with us.
[time=1231] The words are there, and we're going to be singing here in the congregation "O Worship the King."
[time=1237] We'll remain seated as we sing this great hymn together.
[time=1241] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=1303] - And thank you for that good singing.
[time=1305] Beautiful hymn, "O Worship the King." We trust that's what you are doing right now through the special music and then in just a few minutes as Pastor Rick comes and opens up the Word of God that this will be a means for you to worship the Lord.
[time=1318] I feel like I've had enough winter.
[time=1321] I don't know about you, but I think I've had enough snow, enough cold, and I'm ready for the next season to come.
[time=1328] I want blue jays and robins and crocus and all the rest, I want the spring to come.
[time=1335] A song that our male duet sings talks just about that.
[time=1339] It says the heart can be cold, but only God can bring back the springtime.
[time=1346] (gentle music)
[time=1358] # When in the spring the flowers are #
[time=1379] # Blue, mean, bright and fair # # After the grey of winter's gone # # Once again the lark begins its tuning #
[time=1395] # Back in the meadows of my home #
[time=1402] # Nor do my heart bring back the springtime #
[time=1412] # Take away the cold and dark of sea # # Or reveal me now sweet holy spirit #
[time=1424] # May I warm and tender be the great #
[time=1442] (gentle music) # Lord, make me like that stream # # That flows so cool and clear # # Down from the mountains high above # # I will tell the wild the wondrous story #
[time=1467] # All the precious dream filled with your love # # Lord, do my heart bring back the springtime #
[time=1479] # Take away the cold and dark of sea #
[time=1487] # Or reveal me now sweet holy spirit #
[time=1496] # May I warm and tender be the great # # Nor do my heart bring back the springtime #
[time=1512] # Take away the cold and dark of sea #
[time=1522] # Or reveal me now sweet holy spirit # # May I warm and tender be the great #
[time=1553] (gentle music) It is in the springtime when trees and plants and bushes look dead but come alive.
[time=1563] The Spirit of God has that same power in our lives that although we may seem dormant and stifled and dead, that God can make us come alive through Christ Jesus.
[time=1573] I've had that experience in my life and you can have it in yours today.
[time=1578] You will simply examine the claims of Jesus Christ, open up your heart and your mind to His word and examine who He is and the promises and the potentials and the power that He has readily made available to your life today.
[time=1594] I trust that today as we study, you'll make such an open heart available to Jesus Christ.
[time=1600] I invite you to pray with me to that end at this time.
[time=1604] Our Father, we bow before you, acknowledging that you are God.
[time=1609] Some of us have come this morning to worship you and to praise your name, to thank you for sending Christ to die for us.
[time=1617] We have received Him.
[time=1618] Others today, Father, come with an inquisitive mind, a heart that is searching.
[time=1624] Father, we pray that you would make yourself known to that heart this morning.
[time=1628] Others come with the spirit of apathy and indifference.
[time=1632] Father, we pray that you might jolt them, that you might cause their eyes to be open.
[time=1637] They might see Jesus Christ.
[time=1640] For it's in His name we pray.
[time=1641] [AMEN] The man by the name of Joseph Turner is one of the most famous artists in the history of England.
[time=1651] He received great recognition for his ability to paint landscapes and make them seem alive.
[time=1657] Perhaps his most famous work is called a snowstorm at sea.
[time=1663] And when Joseph Turner was asked how he was so able to depict the conditions of a ship in the middle of a snowstorm, he gave this answer.
[time=1673] It's simple.
[time=1675] I was there.
[time=1676] I know what it was like.
[time=1678] For I had myself lashed against the main mask of that ship and I stayed there through the duration of the storm.
[time=1686] A snowstorm at sea.
[time=1689] A painting by a man, but its uniqueness is because that man so wanted to know his subject that he could best depict it to others.
[time=1700] That reminds me of the life and the mind of the Apostle Paul who so wanted to know Jesus Christ that he could know him completely and fully and then be able to make him known to others.
[time=1712] That's the desire of the Apostle Paul and Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1716] So at this time I invite you to open your Bible that you might study with us this morning.
[time=1720] Philippians chapter three, we've been studying this chapter under the title prophet and laws.
[time=1728] Paul talked as though he had taken an audit of his life and he had calculated his assets and then he discovered his assets were really liabilities.
[time=1737] They were losses.
[time=1739] But he claimed a new asset, an eternal asset, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1744] And then beginning in verse eight, he outlines for us five benefits that Christ brings.
[time=1750] Last week we studied the first benefit was the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[time=1756] And the second benefit was the righteousness of Christ that Jesus Christ took our sins in a divine, tracks in transaction and exchanged our sins for his righteousness.
[time=1767] And now today we come to Paul's benefits number three and four.
[time=1773] Philippians chapter three, verse 10, that I might know him and the power of his resurrection
[time=1783] and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death.
[time=1791] Paul begins with a repetition.
[time=1793] One of the best teachers is repetition.
[time=1796] You know your ABCs this morning because somebody drilled them in your head repetitiously.
[time=1803] Paul uses repetition often, back in verse eight, he has already said that I might know him.
[time=1809] He talks about the excellency of the knowledge.
[time=1812] Now he repeats that for emphasis and he's going to give us two areas of knowledge.
[time=1816] But it's important we understand what Paul means by knowledge.
[time=1820] He is not talking about a cold creed or a dead dogma.
[time=1828] He is talking about a live personal, intimate knowledge.
[time=1833] He's not talking about an intellectual understanding of certain facts.
[time=1838] He's talking about something that begins to beat with a relationship.
[time=1843] There are two possible words a writer of the Greek language could use.
[time=1847] The first, Oida.
[time=1849] That word can refer to intellectual knowledge.
[time=1851] That which you deduce the use of logic and reason.
[time=1855] The second word, genosco, it means to know by experience.
[time=1859] To actually have the experience within your own personal background.
[time=1864] Paul uses the word for experience.
[time=1867] He's talking about a very personal term, a relationship.
[time=1871] So tied into relationships, as this word know, that it's used in the Old Testament and New Testament alike to describe the relationship sexually between a husband and a wife.
[time=1884] When the Bible spoke about Joseph and Mary and it said Joseph knew her not, meant that they had not entered into a physical relationship, intimacy.
[time=1895] Paul was saying that I personally, intimately, want to know Christ.
[time=1900] Not only is it a personal term, but it is a very progressive term.
[time=1904] By progressive, I mean that it's not a one time act and stagnant from that point on.
[time=1910] Paul had a unique conversion.
[time=1912] Each person who comes to Christ has a beginning, a point of consummation, a beginning point.
[time=1919] However, the walk with Christ is to be one of increasing knowledge, increasing knowledge.
[time=1927] So he says that I may know him.
[time=1929] Paul's known Christ for 20, 25, 30 years or more, but he still has a hunger to know him.
[time=1936] It's a progressive nature.
[time=1937] Do you know what separates a average mediocre athlete
[time=1943] from an exceptional standout?
[time=1946] It's desire.
[time=1947] It's hunger.
[time=1948] Someone once said that what separates the great athletes from all others is their desire to win.
[time=1956] They said that winning and success is 10% perspiration and 90% inspiration, desire.
[time=1965] I remember being a junior high football player and our coach would say, "Do you want to win and we'd cheer back?" "Yes, yes." "Are you hungry to win and we would growl?" And we'd go through all kinds of charades trying to get that inspiration up.
[time=1981] But he spoke about a hunger and an enthusiasm.
[time=1986] Are you hungry this morning?
[time=1988] I don't mean did you oversleep and you didn't have time for breakfast, but are you hungry this morning for Christ?
[time=1994] I'm hungry right now.
[time=1995] I don't eat breakfast.
[time=1997] I get a can of orange juice and I think that makes you hungrier.
[time=2002] But just as there's a churning in my stomach and a desire for food in your heart at this very moment, is there a hunger?
[time=2010] Do you have a desire to know Christ and to know him more fully if you do than you understand the heartbeat of the Apostle Paul?
[time=2018] Do you remember when you first fell in love with your spouse?
[time=2024] Do you remember how you were attracted to that person and then you met that person?
[time=2029] And there began to be a desire, not just to meet them and to know their name and to exchange a few conversations, but a desire to be with that person and an increasing desire?
[time=2040] Men, I pray that you never lose that fire on Valentine's Day.
[time=2044] I hope that she's just as special now and attractive and you have an appetite to know her as you never had before.
[time=2052] Do you know that you can have that same desire for Jesus Christ?
[time=2055] You can know him and love him and desire him more and more and more.
[time=2060] That was the heartbeat of the Apostle Paul and he wanted to know Christ in two specific ways.
[time=2067] There are a third and fourth benefit if you're taking notes today.
[time=2071] The first that he might know the power of his resurrection.
[time=2075] Now, if you want to be successful today, then you need to talk about success.
[time=2082] We are in the age of how tos, how to be happy, though married, how to raise your children and build character in their life.
[time=2091] How to lose fat, God's way.
[time=2093] This is the age of how tos.
[time=2096] If you want to whip up a crowd, if you want to boaster your ratings and your attendances, you want to have a great appeal on television as a religious broadcaster, then you must talk about success.
[time=2106] You know, there's a desire for success.
[time=2110] There are many who've exchanged the preaching of the gospel for the preaching of power, of positive thinking.
[time=2117] Success-orientedness.
[time=2119] I believe that God is concerned about success, but before you get real excited about our concept of power this morning and the power of the resurrection, you must understand that our fourth point will be that Paul wanted to know how to suffer.
[time=2132] And God is not necessarily a God who simply wills for everyone good health and great wealth.
[time=2139] There's a balance today and a discipline that is to be learned.
[time=2143] We live in an aspirin age.
[time=2146] And what I mean by an aspirin age is we have a desire to go home, take two little pills, put our feet up and the whole world is going to become better.
[time=2156] We have an instant society.
[time=2158] We want to be able to go home and to put our instant dinner into our microwave oven, press a button and have it ready and preferably in a disposable container so that when we're done, we can throw it away.
[time=2169] We have a McDonald's mentality.
[time=2174] You know that is not God's concept of life.
[time=2176] Now there's nothing wrong with an instant meal, instant coffee, instant breakfast, aspirin.
[time=2184] You know if it becomes your approach to life, you're going to have great problems.
[time=2188] If you simply want someone to read you a poem, a prayer and a promise and tell you life's going to be better, you'll be disappointed this morning.
[time=2194] The Bible speaks of the Christian life in the walk
[time=2200] as a struggle, as a fight, as a race and when Paul speaks of a race, he does not often speak of the 100-yard dash.
[time=2209] He speaks of the marathon.
[time=2211] I get tired thinking about that.
[time=2213] So as you come to our concept of power this morning, you must come to it to embrace it with a willingness to invest, not these moments on Sunday morning, but with a willingness to invest your life.
[time=2228] Paul says that I might know the power of his resurrection.
[time=2233] Let me invite you to turn back one book in the Bible to Ephesians chapter one and verse 19.
[time=2242] It's important that you understand the power of the resurrection.
[time=2246] Ephesians chapter one, verse 19.
[time=2249] By the Spirit of God through the pen of Paul, the same time in prison at Rome, a prison epistle, Ephesians chapter one.
[time=2258] He says, verse 19, that you might know what is the exceeding greatness of his power, speaking of God, his power towards us, you and I who believe in Christ, according to the working, the energizing of his mighty power.
[time=2278] Now there is a loaded statement.
[time=2280] He talks about the power of God, but he talks about the greatness.
[time=2285] Then he talks about the strength of God, but he talks about his might.
[time=2288] He's speaking in superlative terms.
[time=2291] And then he gives the final definition of the power of God that works in you and I.
[time=2297] In verse 20, the power which he wrought are worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead.
[time=2306] The very power of God that threw a stone away from a tomb
[time=2312] and that could raise the dead Jesus and cause him to be alive again forever more, that same power is available to you today.
[time=2323] May I suggest today that that far exceeds possibility thinking, the power of mental attitude.
[time=2330] I'm a believer in those things.
[time=2332] To be quite honest, I believe that winning and success is a state of your mind.
[time=2337] You perceive yourself as strong and capable and aggressive, you'll transmit that image to yourself and others, you'll believe it and others will believe it.
[time=2346] Losing is primarily a state of the mind.
[time=2349] You're either a leader or a loser, but you know that life is not simply a matter of turning your mind to the right channel, focusing in on the right program.
[time=2361] There are things that you can change through mind power, that there are things that you cannot.
[time=2367] One of the things that you cannot change by simply your mind is your relationship to God.
[time=2375] Paul speaks of the power of Jesus Christ,
[time=2381] the greatest power, more powerful than the strongest natural force moving water, more explosive than the most strongest power on earth, a nuclear explosion, the power of Jesus Christ, and it's available to you today.
[time=2399] May I share with you what that power can do in your life?
[time=2403] First of all, the resurrection power can bring you to Christ.
[time=2407] The Bible says that the preaching of the cross to those that perish is foolishness, but unto us who believe it is the power of God unto salvation.
[time=2419] You know, there are critics today that believe that the Bible is simply child's play.
[time=2425] It's simply stories, fables, and only the naive are the foolish believe in the Bible.
[time=2432] It's not uncommon for a university student or a businessman or a housewife to be approached with this particular mentality.
[time=2439] Oh, is that right?
[time=2441] You believe in Jonah and the whale?
[time=2442] You mean this guy got thrown overboard.
[time=2445] Big whale came and swallowed him.
[time=2447] He wandered around inside the Wells Valley for three days and three nights, and then the wild got sick and regurgitated him up on the beach, and there was Jonah.
[time=2455] Do you believe that, do you?
[time=2456] Do you believe that Old Mother Hubbard went to her cupboard, fetched her poor doggy a bone?
[time=2461] I suppose that you believe that Jack and Jill went down the hill.
[time=2465] There are those that ridicule a concept of a God that works in nature in a supernatural way, and the God that would reveal himself to man that he might be made known.
[time=2475] But can I share with you that the gospel is not foolishness and it simply does not appeal to the weak of mind?
[time=2482] If you want an example, you're reading of one today in the life of Paul.
[time=2486] He was one who was so eloquent, so gifted in the area of jurisprudence that he could defend himself before governors and kings, and they could not find fault in him.
[time=2497] He was one who could match his intelligence in his wits with the astounding philosophers of the day.
[time=2503] It was Paul who could confound the Greeks, the Stoics, those that had discipline, the Epicureans, those that sought after pleasure, and his wit was so sharp and cunning that he couldn't trap all of them and entice them to listen.
[time=2517] Do you know that he was one so gifted that he could say in a way of eloquence, words that would attract a hostile audience and cause them to respond?
[time=2528] You're reading today.
[time=2529] They're writings of a man of great intelligence.
[time=2533] There are those today's.
[time=2535] There are doctors in this auditorium.
[time=2536] There are lawyers.
[time=2538] There are men of science who are committed to Christ and every area of life, it is not intellectual suicide, but it does take the call of God upon your life.
[time=2548] And he says he is not willing that any should perish.
[time=2551] And if you'll respond to him, the resurrection power of Jesus Christ can give you a new life today, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=2559] The power that raises Jesus Christ from the dead can first of all bring you to Christ if you will simply respond.
[time=2567] Secondly, the resurrection power of Jesus Christ can give you the divine ability to live godly in Christ Jesus.
[time=2576] St. Augustine was a theologian of a supreme level.
[time=2580] He was a man who was very willfully sinful in his early life, converted to Christianity and became one of the greatest minds of the early days of the church age.
[time=2593] Living in about 400 BCE, he wrote several works, "The City of Man and the City of God." And he explained something I believe no one has put better.
[time=2603] Not is this, if you are living apart from Jesus Christ today, then you are free to sin.
[time=2611] You're free to live your own life.
[time=2613] You're free to involve your body with whatever desire you wish.
[time=2618] You're free to sin, but you are not free to not sin
[time=2624] because sin with its enticement leads to bondage and that bondage becomes a chain and Augustine spoke of his own slavery to sin.
[time=2633] But when he came to Christ, he said, "Now I am free, free not to sin." That's why we sang this morning.
[time=2642] Oh, 4,000 tongues to sing.
[time=2644] My great redeemers praise, why do we sing that?
[time=2647] Because he has broken the power of canceled sin.
[time=2650] He has set the captive free.
[time=2654] The power of Jesus Christ today can cause you to live godly in Christ Jesus.
[time=2658] It can give you the strength to walk in a way that you've never walked before.
[time=2662] And that power comes through an intimate relationship and walk with Christ.
[time=2667] Would you know resurrection power today then?
[time=2669] Walk with him, walk with him, hunger after him, grow.
[time=2674] You know that today there is great fear in our city.
[time=2679] There are people with great mental and emotional concerns.
[time=2682] You may have concern this morning about your future, about your job.
[time=2686] Someone saw a bumper sticker that said, "Will the last person to leave Fort Wayne please turn out the lights." There's great apprehension in this city, in our whole economy.
[time=2696] Do you have apprehensions this morning?
[time=2699] Do you know that never before in the history of the church is there a need for counseling?
[time=2704] Can I share with you that the resurrection power is the beginning of the answer to your fears, to your phobias, to your frustrations?
[time=2713] Because Paul said in 2 Timothy chapter one that God has given to us power, love and a sound mind.
[time=2721] A sound mind.
[time=2724] What that is saying is that the beginning of mental and emotional healing, foundation is Jesus Christ and in him there comes power for a life to be rebuilt.
[time=2737] Would you have the power to gain emotional and mental stability than no Christ, no am intimately, enter into an ongoing growing relationship?
[time=2748] There is no aspirin to rebuild your life emotionally, but there is power that can be tapped and drawn through a walk with Jesus Christ.
[time=2760] The power of God, it can save you, it can cause you to live godly in Christ Jesus, the power of God can give you a foundation for emotional stability, it can give you power and boldness in your witness.
[time=2775] Paul was a bold man, the disciples were bold men and they continually prayed for boldness in their witness and God gave you to them, the resurrection power will give you the confidence to stand for Christ.
[time=2790] We're going to give an invitation at the end of this service, an invitation for you to slip out of your seat down this aisle and receive Christ.
[time=2797] You may have wrestled with that for many weeks.
[time=2800] God will give you the boldness to make that decision if you'll so apply the power of God to your life.
[time=2806] Another thing that the power of God will do is that it will keep you, it will keep you.
[time=2814] One of the greatest phobias that besets Christians today is the fear that God is somehow, after dying for them, after loving them eternally, that God is somehow going to let go of them.
[time=2828] But you know God won't let go of you?
[time=2830] He said, "He that comes unto me, I warn, no wise cast out." The Bible says that we are put into the hands of God and God's hands of assurance are better than any hands of insurance.
[time=2843] You see, I'm going to have a not because I've got such a good hold on God, but because God has got such a good hold on me.
[time=2852] And the Bible says in 1 Peter, chapter one, verse five, that we are kept by the power of God unto salvation.
[time=2861] God won't let go of you this morning if you will come to Him.
[time=2865] Paul wanted to know more and more and more of that resurrection power.
[time=2871] This is the man that had the confidence to speak before Christ before Caesar.
[time=2876] This is the man who was willing to die in Lister by stoning.
[time=2880] This is the man who suffered in persecutions, imprisonment, and shipwreck.
[time=2885] He was a man with great power and he said, "There's more." And I want to know more of it.
[time=2890] Do you have that hunger this morning?
[time=2892] Oh, to know him, to know him completely.
[time=2895] And then Paul speaks of another benefit.
[time=2898] He speaks of the benefit of knowing the fellowship
[time=2904] of his suffering.
[time=2905] That's not a good word in 1982.
[time=2908] It's not popular to talk about suffering.
[time=2912] We want to talk about good things, positive things.
[time=2915] Let's keep the enthusiasm high.
[time=2918] Do you know God may have in your life plans for you to suffer?
[time=2923] Best share with you that it's not only a lie that God wills for everyone great health and good wealth, that it is the truth that God wills for us to suffer.
[time=2935] In 2 Timothy, chapter 3, verse 12, the scripture says this.
[time=2940] Yes, all who live godly in Christ Jesus
[time=2946] will suffer persecution.
[time=2949] Expect it.
[time=2951] Peter wrote in the first epistle in the fourth chapter, don't think it's strange.
[time=2955] Don't be shocked that you suffer.
[time=2959] First of all, when you understand the concept of suffering, expect it in your life.
[time=2966] God plans on Christian suffering.
[time=2968] Jesus said, in the world, ye shall have tribulation.
[time=2974] So many have come to Christ under false pretenses.
[time=2978] Because someone said, if you simply receive Jesus Christ today, then God's got a plan for you to be wealthy.
[time=2984] God's got a plan for you to be successful.
[time=2986] God's got a plan to heal your body.
[time=2991] And it's just an instantaneous thing.
[time=2993] Pray and receive Jesus.
[time=2995] And suddenly, everything's going to be better.
[time=2998] Men and women, God may be the glory one who brings the trials and the conflicts in your life.
[time=3005] And he says in his word that you should expect it.
[time=3008] Secondly, he says not only that you should expect it, but that you should rejoice in it.
[time=3014] Rejoice.
[time=3015] Is God some type of sadistic man?
[time=3018] He's like Marquis de Sade, who found fulfillment by persecuting and tormenting and abusing people.
[time=3024] Is that the kind of God that says expect and rejoice?
[time=3028] Persecution?
[time=3029] Oh, no.
[time=3030] He is also the father of every good and perfect gift that comes down from above.
[time=3035] God says that we rejoice because it is the preparation for growth.
[time=3042] Preparation for growth.
[time=3044] We should rejoice because we've been counted worthy to suffer for Christ's name.
[time=3049] That means someone saw Christ in us and decided that that was worth persecuting.
[time=3054] We should be rejoicing that someone saw that our witness was true for Christ.
[time=3059] There's two types of suffering.
[time=3060] They're suffering because of you.
[time=3062] And they're suffering because of Christ.
[time=3064] Don't mistake the two.
[time=3067] If you suffer as an evil doer, don't call that suffering as a Christian.
[time=3071] But rejoice.
[time=3072] Why?
[time=3072] Because someone saw Christ in your life.
[time=3075] Rejoice.
[time=3075] Why?
[time=3076] Because God uses the trials and the tribulations to produce growth.
[time=3082] So popular in our society today.
[time=3085] And it's a growing cult, a new neurosis,
[time=3091] a growing interest in what is popularly called S&M, sadomasochism.
[time=3098] People who are finding their fulfillment, either in abusing others or themselves, Paul was not a sadomasochist.
[time=3107] When he said rejoice, count it all a joy, he simply was one that could look beyond today's trials and problems and have faith in God that he's going to turn those trials into a benefit.
[time=3119] We used to have a poster in our school office that said this.
[time=3122] When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
[time=3126] No God's in the business of doing that.
[time=3128] Taking our trials and our problems and turning them in to our points of rejoicing.
[time=3134] Expect it.
[time=3136] Rejoice in it.
[time=3137] And thirdly, grow by it.
[time=3140] James chapter one gives us this formula.
[time=3144] God sends a trial into our life that that trial might produce patience.
[time=3150] So that that patience might produce growth into maturity.
[time=3154] It's a very unwise thing today to pray for patience when you understand that God will then send a trial into your life to produce it.
[time=3162] But God uses trials.
[time=3164] And so we should grow by our trials.
[time=3168] Did you ever wonder why David knew God so well?
[time=3172] Were you ever amazed at the intimacy between David and God that he could write the Psalms that he wrote?
[time=3178] Did you have a hunger to know God in that way?
[time=3181] How is it that David knew God so well?
[time=3184] May I suggest to you five reasons this morning why David knew God so well?
[time=3190] The first was a lion.
[time=3193] The second was a bear.
[time=3196] You see, David was a shepherd.
[time=3198] And a lion and a bear on different occasions came to attack his sheep and threaten his own life.
[time=3205] But David overcame that trial and that adversity by the strength of God.
[time=3210] And therefore, when the Goliath began the armies of Israel, David was ready.
[time=3217] And that's the third reason why David knew God so well because he met a Goliath.
[time=3222] And he could stand before King Saul.
[time=3224] And King Saul could mock David and say, you're just a boy.
[time=3228] He's a giant.
[time=3230] All of our armies are afraid of him.
[time=3232] What will you do?
[time=3233] And he could say, I met a lion and I met a bear.
[time=3236] And by the strength of God, I defeated him both.
[time=3239] And so shall I do to this felicity.
[time=3243] Because God gave him strength.
[time=3245] And when David defeated the Goliath, that prepared him for King Saul.
[time=3250] A jealous, intensely outraged King
[time=3256] who would pursue him tenaciously day after day, month after month, from city to city to wilderness in caves.
[time=3263] And David learned to trust God because of the tenacity of a King Saul.
[time=3269] And fifthly, David learned his walk with God because of a son by the name of Absolent, a rebellious son, a son who would betray his father, deny his values, try to usurp his throne, take his wives as his own.
[time=3285] That's where David learned his relationship with God.
[time=3288] He learned him in the crucibles of life.
[time=3290] He learned him as his life was being crushed and remolded in the hand of God.
[time=3296] He learned it because of a bear, a lion, a Goliath, a soul,
[time=3302] and an Absolent.
[time=3303] And so the pages of the Old Testament cry with intimacy of knowledge of God from the heart of David because he had learned to suffer.
[time=3311] Paul says that the end of his desire to be made conformable to the death of Christ.
[time=3317] In the Philippines, there are those that have themselves crucified.
[time=3321] That's not what Paul's speaking of.
[time=3323] He's not speaking of emasculating our body, of abusing it.
[time=3327] He's speaking of an attitude that we become dead to ourselves.
[time=3331] And so in Corinthians, he writes, I die daily.
[time=3335] He says to the Church of Galatians, I am crucified with Christ.
[time=3340] Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me.
[time=3347] This morning, we've spoken about two things-- power and suffering.
[time=3353] And the Christian life is a blending of both.
[time=3356] God would give you the power today to receive him as Savior if you'll simply invite him into your heart.
[time=3363] He'll give you the power today to live godly.
[time=3365] If you'll simply enter into a growing relationship with him, he'll bring trials in your life that he might mold you and make you into the Christian and the man of God, the woman of God that he wants you to be.
[time=3379] But it takes boldness.
[time=3380] It takes power.
[time=3381] It takes confidence in God.
[time=3384] I was so impressed with the courage of a high school girl who responded an invitation at Hicksville High School.
[time=3390] An invitation was simply to raise your hand if you would receive Christ.
[time=3395] This young lady knew what it meant to be persecuted early as a Christian.
[time=3399] Now she raised her hand, her boyfriend raised his hand, and pulled her down.
[time=3404] She raised it again-- the confidence, the willingness to suffer that type of ridicule.
[time=3411] You've got a young lady in our Christian school who last week sang a Christian song in a competition.
[time=3417] She sang the song her father's eyes.
[time=3420] The judge awarded her the highest rating at one.
[time=3423] Then he changed it to a two with this remark.
[time=3427] Young lady, don't use a music contest to advance your religious views.
[time=3433] There are going to be those today who will suffer for Christ-- ridicule and persecution.
[time=3439] But if you're not ashamed of him, he said he'll never be ashamed of you.
[time=3444] Let's pray together.
[time=3447] Right now, would you open up your heart and receive Jesus Christ in?
[time=3451] And by faith say, Jesus Christ, I'm willing to suffer.
[time=3455] I want you into my heart.
[time=3457] I pray that you will.
[time=3460] Father, we thank you this morning.
