[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] (buzzing) (buzzing) (buzzing) (buzzing) (buzzing) (buzzing) - Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=81] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=88] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=100] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=105] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prooger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=116] Also, on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour Musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=124] Now, here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=133] - We've come today to worship, to study, to praise God,
[time=139] to sing, that we might say to God, we love you, we adore you, we lay down our life before you.
[time=146] Have you made the decision in your life to surrender it to Jesus Christ?
[time=151] We'll be studying in the Word of God that he has a plan and a goal for each of our lives.
[time=156] And I trust that today, the Word of God and the music that we hear will be a special encouragement to each of us to follow Christ more closely, to love him more dearly.
[time=167] But now our choir begins our worship of a great hymn and they sing for us this morning under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=176] (piano music)
[time=201] (singing in foreign language)
[time=291] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (piano music) - And now let us all praise together with the use of hymn number 45.
[time=316] Guide me both out great Jehovah, hymn number 45.
[time=320] Shall we stand now as we sing this great hymn?
[time=323] (piano music) Every voice together in praise.
[time=329] (singing in foreign language)
[time=350] (singing in foreign language) - Those of you who are watching at home
[time=368] sing along with us, the words are there on your screen.
[time=370] The second stands are together.
[time=372] (singing in foreign language)
[time=409] - Night you and you may be seated.
[time=413] We want you to listen now to a beautiful, beautiful song.
[time=416] It's a song of testimony.
[time=418] Marlene Nichols sings it for us now, and tells us things in her life that are worth everything since she has trusted Christ.
[time=426] (piano music)
[time=439] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=646] - Hello, and thank you for joining us today
[time=669] for the Bible Hour.
[time=670] We're so thankful for these few moments just to talk with you friends in our television family.
[time=676] With me today is my good friend Don Kruger.
[time=678] How are you, Don?
[time=679] - I'm fine, Rick, how are you?
[time=681] - I'm doing well.
[time=682] - Hasn't been exciting the letters that we've received from pastors over these last few snowy Sundays telling us about the fact that we spoke about their church and their income on television.
[time=694] - It really has been a special encouragement for me to receive letters from pastors, even a few phone calls and one good friend from another church here in Fort Wayne took the time to stop me at a restaurant.
[time=706] Just to say thank you for the ministry of the Bible Hour and being sensitive to the needs of local churches.
[time=712] We really do hope and trust that you're a part of a church.
[time=716] The ministry of the Bible Hour is to reach out to people who aren't able to make it to church or to minister to people who make it home early from their church service or when our broadcast is at a time that you can join us.
[time=728] And we want to share in the ministry of local churches we are a local church and we're thankful that we could give encouragement to people to send their contributions to their home church and I trust that you did that.
[time=741] Today I'd like to ask you to consider helping us financially also in addition to what you're doing to help your church.
[time=748] The Bible Hour goes into the homes of countless numbers of people in the hospitals, in the prisons and we need help in order to make that ministry a possibility.
[time=759] We need you to consider joining the Founders Club.
[time=762] Don why don't you just take a moment and tell people a little bit about the Founders Club.
[time=767] - Sure Rick, the Founders Club is a tremendous group of people dedicated Christians all over this part of the country who watch the Bible Hour and are interested in getting the gospel out through this means and they support us monthly with their supports.
[time=781] Some may be $10 and many, many others much more.
[time=785] We certainly appreciate the gifts that many people have sent in.
[time=788] In that way they feel like they're a part of the Bible Hour and then we every month send to those people who are members of the Founders Club a letter.
[time=798] You write a letter to them.
[time=800] They also receive timeless insights which is our monthly devotional book.
[time=805] They receive a little watchword that they can put on their desk or their kitchen table.
[time=809] A little verse that is an encouragement every day and they are people who not only give but they're people who pray.
[time=817] Many of you people are out there who would like to be a part of this.
[time=820] We'd love to give you that opportunity.
[time=822] I want you to write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,15-000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15.
[time=829] And we would be glad to send you information about joining the Founders Club.
[time=836] - Don we have an aggressive goal ahead of us.
[time=838] We're hoping to enroll over 100 new Founders Club members.
[time=843] There are people who support the Bible Hour regularly every month, some for as little as $10 a month, others for considerably larger amounts, what they're able to give.
[time=854] If we can enroll over 100 new Founders Club members, that will go a long way to ensuring the financial stability of this ministry.
[time=862] Along with the things Don mentioned to you, we'll include a newsletter to you which we call the scroll.
[time=868] This month's scroll is dedicated to explaining to you exactly the financial needs of the Bible Hour and outlining where each gift is spent.
[time=878] We're so thankful for your support in prayer, in giving, and in sharing the gospel with other people.
[time=885] I hope that you'll stay with us for the rest of the ministry of the Bible Hour today.
[time=889] We're going to have some music that I know will encourage your heart.
[time=892] And then today from the Book of Philippians, I want to share for you what I believe to be God's goal for your life.
[time=899] Join us now.
[time=900] (gentle music)
[time=928] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1124] (audience cheering) - Thank you ladies for drawing our attention to the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1134] And Mary truly was unique woman to give her body, to give her life, to the hands of God to be used, however his will determined.
[time=1144] You know God not only has a will for Mary, he has a will for your life.
[time=1149] He wants to use you, he wants to use me.
[time=1152] And if we place our hands, our life into the hands of God, he has a plan for us, we can turn to him.
[time=1159] The men singers are going to sing for us in just a moment that we can turn to Jesus Christ.
[time=1165] But may I just share with you how appreciative we are of the ministry of Dave and Peggy Miller, being a part of our church.
[time=1173] They sing, they labor often, and God has a new location and a new plan for them.
[time=1178] The millers are going to be moving to St. Paul, Minnesota, and this is the last opportunity we'll have to hear Dave minister to us in music as a part of the men singers today.
[time=1188] We're so thankful that God gives to us the millers and countless other numbers of families who've come to serve, not just to sin.
[time=1196] The men singers sing for us now about our ability to turn to Christ because he truly cares for us.
[time=1203] (upbeat music)
[time=1211] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=1365] - Thank you, men singers.
[time=1373] And in particular, Dave Miller will miss you, but we hope to have you back soon from the cold land of Minnesota.
[time=1381] Wasn't supposed to snow today, but it's Sunday, so you should expect it just about every week.
[time=1387] That is a good song, "Where Can I Go but to the Lord?" Great multitude had come to Christ.
[time=1392] We're attracted to Him.
[time=1394] And then when the situation changed and it wasn't nearly so attractive, the multitude withered away, Christ turned to His disciples and said, "Will you two go?" Peter said unto Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go, for thou alone has the words of eternal life." We've come this morning to draw attention to the Word of God because in it, we can see Jesus Christ and we can see life.
[time=1420] So let us begin our study this morning by asking God to be our teacher and our guide as we search the scriptures.
[time=1429] Our Father, we thank You today.
[time=1431] You have spoken that You have made Yourself known to us and that as we study this morning, we do not simply study philosophy or history or science, but we study the book of life, "The Word of God." And Father, we also know that You not only give by inspiration Your Word, but You give by illumination, insight and understanding.
[time=1454] And we ask this morning that You illumine our hearts, that we're able to see not only Your Word, but to see ourselves in light of Your Word, that we might desire to know Christ more fully and to serve Him more.
[time=1468] For it's in Jesus' name we pray, eight men.
[time=1471] The story is told about a young idealistic, determined, enthusiastic preacher with many high ideals and he mounted the pulpit with this expression.
[time=1482] It's time for Christianity to overthrow communism, socialism, totalitarianism.
[time=1489] And in the middle of that, a lady in the back and elderly lady waved her cane and said, "Sunny, why you're at it?
[time=1494] "Can you overthrow rheumatism for me?" Well, we have ideals and high expectations, but someone said an ideal is that which all of us are supposed to respect and none of us are supposed to attain.
[time=1510] Is that true in your life that you have high ideals, but you really don't expect to meet those ideals, to fulfill them?
[time=1519] Is it true that you have goals and high and lofty goals, but you're really not hoping this morning to meet those goals?
[time=1526] I believe goals are important in every area of your life, particularly your spiritual life.
[time=1533] A very good book by Zig Ziglar is entitled "See You at the Top." It's a resource book and a motivational book for businessmen and women, teaching them how they can make it to the top of their business.
[time=1544] And in a little cartoon Zig Ziglar pictures of stairway in an elevator and a man standing in front of that.
[time=1551] But there is a caption, a tag placed upon the door to the elevator that says, "Out of order." You must take the stairs.
[time=1560] And in the stairs that Zig Ziglar builds to success as a business person, one of the important steps is that of goals.
[time=1569] Goals.
[time=1570] I believe he's correct.
[time=1572] Not only in a business sense, but in a spiritual sense.
[time=1575] If we are to be successful spiritual dynamic Christian, then it demands that there be a goal for us to pursue a goal to follow.
[time=1585] In Philippians, Paul tells us of such a goal.
[time=1589] I invite you to turn with me, if you will, in the book of Philippians to Philippians the third chapter.
[time=1595] And I'll read for you this morning, Philippians chapter three verses 10 through 14.
[time=1603] Now Paul has said back in verses one through seven that he is counting all things but a loss.
[time=1609] All of his past assets are now a loss, and he's gaining new benefits.
[time=1614] The first was the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[time=1617] The second was the righteousness of Christ.
[time=1620] The third was the resurrection power of Christ.
[time=1624] The fourth was the fellowship of his suffering.
[time=1628] And now we'll find the fifth benefit in Christ.
[time=1632] In verse 10, I read that I may know him and the power
[time=1638] of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering, being made conformable unto his death.
[time=1647] If by any means, I might attain unto the resurrection
[time=1653] of the dead, not as though I had already attained.
[time=1657] Neither were already perfect.
[time=1660] But I follow after, if that I may apprehend, that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[time=1670] Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do for getting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=1691] Paul is now speaking about a goal and ideal that he has for his own life.
[time=1697] Paul was a determined man, a man of great accomplishment.
[time=1701] But I believe that every man or every woman of great accomplishments is an individual who has great goals.
[time=1709] And Paul has a single goal, a divinely given desire that he gives to us in three ways in this particular passage.
[time=1718] Oh, God is in the business of giving divine desires.
[time=1722] God has a desire for my life, a desire for your life, a desire for each one of us to uniquely use us.
[time=1730] And yet he wants not only to have that desire in his heart, he wants to take that desire and put it in our heart.
[time=1737] Wouldn't it be a thrill this morning if you knew the desires and the goals and expectations that you have were given to you by God?
[time=1745] And the pursuit and fulfillment of your life was simply the pursuit and fulfillment of the will of God for you.
[time=1752] God divinely does place desires into the heart of people.
[time=1757] David declared that in Psalm 37, verse four.
[time=1761] He said, delight thyself also in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.
[time=1769] It's important that you understand that David was not saying he'll give you the object of your desires, but more than that, he'll give you the desires themselves.
[time=1778] Now how does one receive from God the desires that God would want that person to possess?
[time=1784] An appetite sent from heaven.
[time=1787] Well David said, by delighting yourself in the Lord.
[time=1790] Here we meet the Apostle Paul, a man who had a goal and a desire given by God.
[time=1796] Did he match the formula?
[time=1797] Did he delight in God?
[time=1799] Yes he did.
[time=1800] Remember the verses, immediately preceding those which we read this morning.
[time=1805] Paul said, I want to know the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[time=1811] Paul said, I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering.
[time=1818] Paul loved, delighted in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1822] Therefore God placed within him a desire and a goal.
[time=1827] That goal simply stated is to be like Christ.
[time=1833] But he's gonna describe that desire, that divine desire in three ways.
[time=1838] The first of which is verse 11.
[time=1840] If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection
[time=1846] of the dead.
[time=1847] Now here's what Paul was saying in this particular passage.
[time=1850] He is saying that I want to be in my life just like I am going to be in my resurrected life.
[time=1860] He is not speaking here on a hypothetical case nor is he speaking on a conditional case.
[time=1869] Conditionally in that he, Paul is saying, I hope that my life is good enough that I somehow make it to God's great resurrection.
[time=1878] Paul wasn't hoping that.
[time=1879] That was a certainty in his life.
[time=1881] He's the one that said in chapter one of Philippians, I am confident, being confident of this very thing.
[time=1888] That he who began a good work in you and me will continue it.
[time=1892] God will continue it.
[time=1893] Paul was confident.
[time=1895] It was Paul who said nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[time=1898] Height nor depth, principality nor power, nothing.
[time=1902] Paul was not saying conditionally.
[time=1904] I hope that I am part of the great resurrection.
[time=1906] I hope I attain that.
[time=1908] What he was saying is this.
[time=1911] I want to be in my life today a living resurrected person.
[time=1918] The Greeks, like we Americans, had this concept of death.
[time=1923] That when someone was alive, they're standing up.
[time=1926] And when someone is dead, they're lying down.
[time=1930] And so the word resurrection means to stand up again.
[time=1934] That's exactly the etymology of the word.
[time=1937] Resurrection is anostasis, meaning the stand on again.
[time=1942] The stand up again.
[time=1944] Now here's what Paul was saying.
[time=1945] He was saying, I so want to live my life and the power of the resurrection that I look like someone who is standing up again amongst those who are spiritually lying on their backs.
[time=1959] Well, you see, when I'm resurrected, and when you're resurrected, I'm not gonna have a frail feeble body that has indigestion and rheumatism and arthritis.
[time=1968] I'm gonna have a strong fit body and a strong fit mind.
[time=1974] I'm gonna have a moral completion that I will completely be delivered from the presence of sin and all live in heaven as a new resurrected person.
[time=1983] Paul was saying, that's what I want to be today.
[time=1987] The Bible says that we should have that as our same goal.
[time=1993] Now here's the proof of that interpretation.
[time=1996] You may say, well, that's just your interpretation.
[time=1998] I believe that Paul was saying no, that he's gonna die in the hopes that he'll rise again.
[time=2004] Let me invite you to read on the next verse and see if that makes sense.
[time=2007] Paul says, not as though I had already attained, neither were already perfect.
[time=2012] Now, if Paul was speaking of dying and being resurrected again,
[time=2018] would he have to write a disclaimer saying, I'm not there yet?
[time=2021] Oh, if Paul would have meant his resurrection, they would have said, oh, that's future.
[time=2028] But Paul's saying, now don't misunderstand, I'm not there yet.
[time=2032] Well, if you're alive, you don't have to explain that you're dead.
[time=2035] The joke that's often told about Baptist churches, if you go once, you get on their membership list.
[time=2041] And in order to get off the list, you have to die and send a letter from your new address.
[time=2046] Is that what Paul's saying?
[time=2048] That I've died and now I'm hoping that wouldn't make sense.
[time=2052] Only way it can make sense is if Paul was speaking about a resurrected life today.
[time=2056] And if you just look back one verse preceding it, you say he's prayed that he might have the power of the resurrection.
[time=2062] Paul says my goal is to be today what God ultimately wants me to be in Christ Jesus.
[time=2070] He states that in the second way in verse 12, not as though I had already attained, neither were already perfect.
[time=2080] Paul uses the word perfect in the sense of maturity and absolute completion.
[time=2088] The Bible, I believe, is a good book that needs a good commentary.
[time=2094] May I suggest to you the absolute best commentary to help you understand the Bible?
[time=2099] That commentary would be the Bible itself.
[time=2103] If you read the book of Genesis and it says the serpent was in the garden and you don't understand that, then read the book of Revelation and it'll tell you that the serpent was Satan himself.
[time=2112] You want to understand this concept of maturity then rather than read a commentary, I suggest that you read the Bible.
[time=2119] This is a very common word in the pages of New Testament, particularly a common word that comes from the pen of Paul.
[time=2126] The book of Philippians was written by Paul in prison at the same time that he wrote three other epistles, Philemon's, Colossians, and Ephesians, and many times when a person writes four letters, the same thing is on his heart and he repeats himself.
[time=2141] And so we'll find a repetition of this word in this concept in Ephesians.
[time=2146] So allow me to invite you to turn back one book in your Bible to Ephesians chapter four and verse 13.
[time=2154] Ephesians four, 13.
[time=2156] Paul writes and says, "Till we all come in the unity of faith
[time=2166] "and the knowledge of the Son of God unto," and here's our word, a perfect man, "unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Paul said, first of all, I want to live like a resurrected man.
[time=2182] I want to live so Christ-like that I look like I'm a resurrected man.
[time=2186] Secondly, he says, I want to be a complete man or a perfect man and here's what he meant by that, that he would have the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God that he would come unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[time=2202] That's what the word perfect means.
[time=2204] It means to grow in maturity till we become more Christ-like.
[time=2209] You know, the unfortunate thing that you and I do as Christians is this.
[time=2217] We become content with partial maturity and partial growth and partial obedience.
[time=2226] We struggle and we reach a plateau and we become content.
[time=2230] Rather than to take each step, we simply want to plateau off.
[time=2233] But God wants us to be completely mature.
[time=2236] He doesn't want partial growth or partial obedience.
[time=2240] Reminds me of the story about a man who filled his income tax out form, knowingly shorting the government of what he owed them and he went to bed.
[time=2247] He couldn't sleep and he couldn't sleep and he got up and he wrote another letter to the IRS and said, I couldn't sleep because I didn't pay you all the money I owed you.
[time=2255] Here's $50 and left it anonymously and put a PS on the bottom.
[time=2260] He said, if I still can't go to sleep, I'll send you the rest of the money that I owe you to.
[time=2264] That's where most of us are.
[time=2268] There are a lot of areas of struggle in our life and so we say, well, I'm gonna work on this one and then I'll just be content and I'll just be at my plateau and that's where I'll rest.
[time=2279] God said, what about these?
[time=2282] And you say, well, that's good for a preacher to say.
[time=2285] That's good for the apostle Paul to say, but you remember Ephesians 4, 13 says, "Till we all, all of us." That's not God's plan for Paul.
[time=2295] It's not God's plan for my life, that's God's plan for your life.
[time=2299] I'm not unique in that I'm a pastor and I often tell teenagers when I speak there that I was born a human being was until much later in life that I became a preacher.
[time=2309] I'm not unique, I'm not different from you, but God expects of me, he expects of you.
[time=2315] So important that you understand that God has a goal for your life.
[time=2320] Now, it's also important that you understand in that goal that God doesn't allow an excuse that the goal is too high.
[time=2329] There are many people who take this approach to the Christian life.
[time=2335] Well, if God expects perfection and God expects Christ's likeness,
[time=2344] I can never make that.
[time=2346] Therefore, I'm not gonna try, I'm not gonna try.
[time=2350] No one can do that, so why bother?
[time=2353] Paul was a man who understood the goal, but he said, I'm gonna pursue it, that's my desire to be like Christ, and he admitted, no, I'm not there.
[time=2364] But that didn't mean that he would quit.
[time=2367] And God doesn't take excuses when he lays before us the goal being made into the image, just like his own dear son.
[time=2376] That's God's goal for everyone.
[time=2379] First of all, that we would live like resurrected men and women.
[time=2383] Secondly, that we would grow in our maturity.
[time=2386] And thirdly, that same goal is outlined in a new way through the words of athletic competition.
[time=2393] Verse 14, I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2401] He talks about a mark, a target, a goal.
[time=2405] Now in that, he is saying to us that just as an athlete runs towards the finish line, so are we to run, to be like Christ.
[time=2419] What is the mark?
[time=2421] The mark is excellence.
[time=2423] Let's take it out of the race and think of a marksman with a rifle.
[time=2428] He has a target, concentric circles getting closer and closer and closer until there's a center bull's eye.
[time=2435] What Paul is saying is that's the mark.
[time=2437] I want to hit bull's eye with my life.
[time=2439] Every word I say, every thought I think, every act that I perform, I want to hit the bull's eye.
[time=2445] That's the mark that I am after.
[time=2447] So Paul says that his desire is to be like Christ and he gives that in three ways, to be a resurrected man, to be a mature Christian, no plat toes, but always striving upward.
[time=2461] And then finally, to hit the mark, to hit the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2469] Well with that desire, Paul couples it with energy.
[time=2472] He couples it with determination.
[time=2475] And I believe that he often draws out of the world of athletics because it represents determination so well.
[time=2483] Many of you men have been involved in athletics.
[time=2487] Many of you ladies have.
[time=2488] And so you'll understand something, the illustration of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2492] But so did these Greeks to whom he wrote.
[time=2495] They were the people who hosted the Olympic Games in the northern peninsula of Greece is where the games were often held.
[time=2503] Philippi is not far from that location.
[time=2507] So he's writing to a group of people experienced in the realm of athletics and also he describes determination in several ways.
[time=2517] First of all, he says, "Brother, I count not myself "to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, "forgetting those things which are behind, "reaching forth to those things which are before "I press towards the goal." Now here's Paul's determination in the phrase, "This one thing I do." That is a principle for success, not only in your spiritual life, but in absolutely every area of your life.
[time=2545] Paul didn't say, to quote Howard Hendricks, "These 40 things I dabble in." There should be a central purpose to each and every person's life today.
[time=2558] And that central purpose is this, I wanna be more like Jesus Christ.
[time=2564] That was Paul's one purpose.
[time=2566] That was Paul's one desire.
[time=2568] And that was the determined thing in his life.
[time=2571] And in Romans, Paul gave us the great doctrine of salvation.
[time=2576] And in Romans, he outlined very thoroughly God's plan of justification, God's plan of sanctification.
[time=2584] And he ends in Romans chapter eight by saying this, that God not only predestinated us and called us and justified us and in the future is gonna glorify us, but God did that for a purpose.
[time=2599] And his purpose was this, that you and I, to quote the text, might be made into the image of his own dear son.
[time=2611] Did that mean that Paul didn't care about eating?
[time=2614] No, I imagine Paul liked to eat.
[time=2616] He was a Baptist, he did anyway.
[time=2618] Did that mean that Paul did not have other interests?
[time=2621] I'm sure he had other interests.
[time=2623] What that meant though was Paul had a primary goal and everything else in life was subordinated to that one goal.
[time=2631] My number one goal, occupationally, is to be a preacher of the word of God.
[time=2638] That means as I approach this next week, I'm gonna do a lot of things.
[time=2642] I'll visit people in the hospital, I'll sit in meetings.
[time=2644] I already think we've had enough meetings for one year, but I'll go to some meetings.
[time=2649] I'll take time to do some visiting in homes and teach evangelism.
[time=2653] I'll be involved with the Christian school, but all of those things are subordinated to one thing, studying and preparing my mind and heart for next Sunday morning's message.
[time=2664] Everything is subordinated to that one chief responsibility.
[time=2667] That's where I'm at, occupationally.
[time=2670] But here's where you and I both should be spiritually.
[time=2673] I've gotta work, I've gotta provide for my family, I'm gonna be involved in recreation, I'm gonna overeat, but this one thing is the major goal that all other things are subordinated to, and that is I'm gonna be like Jesus Christ more and more every day in every possible way.
[time=2692] That's what he meant by this one thing I do.
[time=2697] Paul didn't say, therefore I'm gonna retreat into a monastery and I'm gonna sit there.
[time=2702] I'm gonna open my Bible, I'm gonna read my Bible all day and pray all night and eat crummy food.
[time=2707] Paul said I'm gonna live, but I'm gonna live with a major goal and now he describes his determination through three key verbs all out of the world of athletics.
[time=2717] The first one, verse 13, forgetting those things which are behind.
[time=2723] What he was saying, he's picturing a runner who forgets what's behind him.
[time=2729] Now I don't know if you've ever been involved in competition, but even if you're just an observer, there's one thing you'll notice.
[time=2736] The guy who is in last place never looks back.
[time=2739] There's nothing back there for him to see, but there's a tremendous danger when you're in the middle or particularly if you're in the lead to look back, to see how everyone else is doing, to see where the competition is at.
[time=2751] And the danger of looking back is that you cannot keep your eye on the goal, on the finish line, on the target.
[time=2760] And Paul was saying like a runner who only looks ahead, I never look back.
[time=2767] He was saying, I don't look back at all the things I've given up for Christ.
[time=2770] He said, I'm not looking back even positively of the things I've done for Christ.
[time=2775] Both of those are dangerous.
[time=2777] Don't look back at what you may have to give up for Christ, look forward to what he has for you.
[time=2782] And don't look back and say, well God, I've already done this and I've already done this.
[time=2788] You'll decide it's time to retire.
[time=2789] You've already done your share.
[time=2792] God says, you're no retirement in Jesus Christ.
[time=2794] Don't look back.
[time=2796] God told a unique woman one time not to look back, but she did.
[time=2801] I believe that God told Lot's wife not to look back because she had to make a choice.
[time=2806] Would she look ahead by faith that what God had for or would she choose to look back and want the things she's leaving behind?
[time=2814] And God brings all of us to that same point of choice.
[time=2817] We're gonna look ahead and say, God, what you want me to do at all pursuit?
[time=2820] Are we gonna look back and say, God, I don't wanna do that.
[time=2822] I wanna have all these comforts, all these other concerns.
[time=2826] The Bible says, don't look back.
[time=2829] Scripture says, no man when putting his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the service.
[time=2835] Don't look back.
[time=2838] The reason is you take your eye off of the target.
[time=2842] I swim competitively in high school and can I share with you some illustrations, but before I do that, I need to explain something.
[time=2849] That there are many pastors and Bible teachers who were all American football players or all state or all something.
[time=2855] In the world of swimming, the only all I was was all wet.
[time=2859] At the same time, there are some illustrations that I'd share with you this morning.
[time=2863] In a swimming pool, built for competition, each lane has in the center of that lane a black line at the bottom.
[time=2871] That's so you can swim straight.
[time=2873] But more important is at the side wall, at the end of that black line, which usually stops five foot from the wall, at the end of that wall is a cross, a black cross.
[time=2884] Now, the purpose for that is so that you can see the wall because at the rate of some of the excellent swimmers, they're swimming so fast, the water's coming in their eye so intently they can't see a white wall, except for that black cross gives them a goal and a target.
[time=2900] And you keep your eye on that target.
[time=2903] Now, some pools don't have that.
[time=2905] Sometimes as a swimmer, the target's there, but you take your eye off of it.
[time=2909] Can I tell you that's a very dangerous thing to do?
[time=2912] I've made the mistake in two ways.
[time=2914] If you don't look at that target, you're swimming down and you think it's time to do a flip turn where you throw your feet over and you're still 10 yards from the wall.
[time=2922] May I share with you, it's rather embarrassing to flip and to miss.
[time=2926] It's really hard to push off of water.
[time=2929] And you've got to stop, go back, touch the wall and by that time the race is over.
[time=2933] There's another danger too.
[time=2935] That is if you take the eye off the target, you can swim down instead of being five foot away from the wall, you can be two foot too close and flip and throw your body right out of the pool.
[time=2945] I've done that also.
[time=2947] Can I share with you that neither one of those experiences were very positive, but if you're successful, you keep your eye on the target.
[time=2957] You keep your eye on the goal.
[time=2959] Do you know how it is that you miss the target?
[time=2962] It's when you want to take a breath, look to the side and you see, how's everyone else doing?
[time=2968] God said, don't look around.
[time=2970] You know, there was another guy in his Christian life he wanted to look around, see how everybody else was doing.
[time=2974] Christ said to Peter, Peter, do you love me?
[time=2979] Yes, Lord, you know everything you know that I love you.
[time=2982] Peter, but do you really love me?
[time=2984] And Peter said, well, Lord, what about John?
[time=2987] Christ said, Peter, I'm talking to you.
[time=2995] Don't look around.
[time=2996] There's a tremendous tendency in our Christian life that we're running the race.
[time=3001] When we look around and say, well, I'm a lot better than that guy.
[time=3004] Therefore, I can slow down, I don't need to strive anymore 'cause I'm sure a lot better than the most of the people at that church.
[time=3010] As a matter of fact, did I tell you about and then they justify their complacency because someone else, that's a don't look around.
[time=3019] Forget it, forget what's behind you, forget it.
[time=3023] Secondly, he said, run, reaching forward.
[time=3028] A runner, as he approaches the tape, the finish line, he so leans forward that his feet have to run faster just to keep under the extension of his chest and arms, reaching for that goal, an anticipation and desire to be first.
[time=3044] That ought to be the character of our walk, that there's such desire that there's a reaching out to be more like Christ.
[time=3053] When Dr. Livingston came back from Africa, someone said, Dr. Livingston, are you prepared to go anywhere now?
[time=3060] He said, young man, I'm prepared to go anywhere as long as it's forward.
[time=3064] I know that that would be the characteristic of our spiritual life, that we're determined to go anywhere as long as it's forward for Jesus Christ forward.
[time=3076] Then the third verb, I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ.
[time=3085] Jesus, press.
[time=3087] It means the pressure to run, to go, to pursue.
[time=3092] There's a story told about a young man who left England and he went to the Alps of Switzerland.
[time=3098] He began climbing and he was climbing.
[time=3101] He became famous as a climber in that little community.
[time=3105] But one day he fell and was killed.
[time=3110] They buried him in a churchyard and there are only three facts about the young man.
[time=3114] His birth, date, the date of his death and this inscription, he died climbing.
[time=3123] I believe that's probably somewhere in the Roman Empire near the body of the Apostle Paul.
[time=3131] He died striving, climbing, running, pursuing.
[time=3138] You know God has a standard of excellence, not mediocrity, but excellence.
[time=3143] Do you know what makes a winner?
[time=3145] A winner is his determination that he will be first.
[time=3150] An athletic competition, when you're in a multi-heat meet, they usually have preliminary heats and then two final heats.
[time=3160] The first heat, they call the consolation heat.
[time=3163] Those are numbers seven through 12.
[time=3166] And then the championship heats, those that compete for one through six.
[time=3171] As a repeated contestant in the consolation heat, can I tell you something?
[time=3177] There is no consoling in being sixth through 12.
[time=3181] In a championship heat, there's very little satisfaction
[time=3187] in being second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
[time=3192] An athlete wants to be first and he labors to be first, and he strives and he forgets and he denies self and he reaches fourth because he wants to be first.
[time=3206] Paul's saying that is the pattern for the Christian.
[time=3209] There is a desire, not to come in in the consolation heat.
[time=3214] Doesn't wanna be an also rant.
[time=3216] He wants to be more like Christ in every area of his life.
[time=3224] Recently, evangelical Christians have come up with a new concept and a good concept.
[time=3230] That's to understand that the church is not primarily the place that you find lost people.
[time=3235] Unsay people do not get out of bed and say why better go get caught up on my religion this morning.
[time=3241] The message of the gospel has gotta go to the marketplace.
[time=3244] You discover in the book of Acts that Paul often went to the Agora, the marketplace.
[time=3249] And so Christians now are producing films, not to be shown in churches, but films that are Christian in their content and evangelical in their nature and soul winning in their performance and sending them into the secular markets.
[time=3262] Billy Graham has produced some excellent films, The Hiding Place in Johnny, and those films have gone out into the marketplace and had an influence for Christ.
[time=3272] And now a new film comes, Chariots of Fire.
[time=3277] Tells the story of the early 1900s and two runners destined for the Olympics, but they ran for different purposes.
[time=3284] One runner ran that he might advance his country,
[time=3290] the fame of his nation, and his own personal prominence.
[time=3294] But another runner ran because he believed that God gave him a gift and the ability to run.
[time=3300] And he ran that he might live for the glory of Christ.
[time=3302] Two runners, one race, two completely different purposes.
[time=3310] You're a runner this morning.
[time=3312] Can I ask you a question?
[time=3314] For what goal do you run?
[time=3317] What is the master target, the goal that you're stretching for, your striving for?
[time=3323] Is it to be more like Jesus Christ?
[time=3326] Oh, to be like the blessed Redeemer?
[time=3329] Is that the song of your heart this morning?
[time=3332] I want to make it confession.
[time=3334] I feel like I'm in good company.
[time=3336] I'm not there yet.
[time=3338] I like those little buttons that Bill Gothard puts out.
[time=3341] Please be patient with me.
[time=3343] God's not finished with me yet.
[time=3346] I haven't apprehended.
[time=3348] All that Christ has apprehended me for.
[time=3351] But I do know that he apprehended me to be more like him.
[time=3355] That's his plan for my life.
[time=3357] But I know too that it's planned for yours.
[time=3360] Men and women, you cannot use the excuse today that you don't have to strive because you know Rick Hawks, and he's not anything close to Christ like.
[time=3369] Therefore, you don't have to try.
[time=3371] Men and women, I know I'm not there.
[time=3374] But I do know that that's God's goal for my life.
[time=3377] And he will not give any excuse, attention.
[time=3383] He demands that I be more like Jesus Christ every day
[time=3389] and in every way.
[time=3391] For what race are you running?
[time=3394] What goal and what target have you focused your eyes on?
[time=3398] Are you forgetting the things that are behind?
[time=3401] Are you stretching forth to the things that are before you?
[time=3405] Paul said the benefit of Christ is the goal of the prize of the high calling of being more like him.
[time=3413] I pray that that's the goal of your life.
[time=3416] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3420] While we pray this morning, may I ask you to be honest with yourself as you listen.
[time=3425] Perhaps this morning you have not even begin to run the race for Christ.
[time=3430] You're living for yourself.
[time=3432] Perhaps this morning you look back at your life and you say, there was a time when I was a runner for Christ.
[time=3439] Somewhere I lost goals, I lost directions.
[time=3443] My life now is consumed with other things.
[time=3446] I ask you this morning, to be honest with yourself, have you received Christ a Savior?
[time=3452] If you have, are you pursuing Him?
[time=3456] If you have not, would you receive Him today?
[time=3460] Would you simply open up your heart and pray and invite Him in?
[time=3464] If you have already made that decision, have you fixed your goals on Jesus Christ?
[time=3470] Is the desire of your heart to be more like him?
[time=3473] Do you have that desire?
[time=3474] Do you have that determination that you're going to forget what's behind, reach to the fourth, and press towards the goal to be more like Christ?
[time=3483] Oh, how I pray, that's exactly what they'll do.
[time=3488] Our Father, we turn our attention to you.
