[time=60] - Welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=63] Each week Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=71] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=82] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=87] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible hour.
[time=100] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=109] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=118] - But we can welcome people to the Bible hour today who can join us for the ministry of television and that we might be encouraged today as we study God's Word to see Him in His Word and to hear us praises in His music.
[time=133] We have great hope as believers because we believe that Jesus Christ is coming again, that He is going to come for His church before the great tribulation and rapture us that we can be forever with the Lord.
[time=147] Our choir is going to sing for us now, a great hymn, a melody of hymns that talk about the fact that Christ will return, Christ returneth, our choir under the direction of Mr. Don Prueger.
[time=174] [MUSIC - 158 seconds]
[time=340] Now let's take our hymnals and turn in them to him number 232, and we'll sing a beautiful ole hymn close to thee, hymn number 232.
[time=349] [MUSIC]
[time=357] Everyone singing together.
[time=359] [MUSIC - 71 seconds]
[time=438] And thank you for that good singing. We're going to listen now to the music of our young people, our graded choir program, and we're going to be listening to the Sunshine Choir on my right hand side,
[time=449] and over here is all God's children on my left hand side, and really they're all God's children, and we're very, very glad to present them to you right now.
[time=457] They are going to sing a beautiful song, "Hallelujah, Hallelujah." [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=540] Each day Don and I look forward to this special opportunity, apart from the Morning Worship Service,
[time=546] just to talk with you friends who are joining us for television. Good morning Don and glad to see you here.
[time=552] Good morning Rick. It's always a delight for me to arrive early in our building and hear the people who are part of our music ministry
[time=560] rehearsing for the songs they're going to sing, and in my mind is just reverberating that last song we heard.
[time=566] You even said, "I hit a few notes right." The joy of that song is that it talks about being what Jesus Christ wants us to be,
[time=574] and following after Him till the race comes to an end.
[time=578] I know in just a few moments that particular song is going to encourage your heart and challenge you
[time=584] to pursue the goal being Christ-like. And I don't know whether you planned it that way, but that just fits hand in glove with what I have to share from God's Word today.
[time=593] Many of the times Rick, the Lord just works it out that way. You don't even plan it, and God has it figured out beforehand,
[time=600] and it works out so that what we have to say musically fits in with what you have to say from the Word of God.
[time=605] I know that God plans and is in control of everything, and I'm just looking forward to the rest of this service.
[time=611] The first part I know has been encouragement to many people, and I know that the music that we're going to hear is going to challenge us,
[time=618] and I trust that the message from God's Word will fortify your life.
[time=623] We like to talk to you as a family, and just to share with you what our needs are, what our ministry is.
[time=630] The Bible hour is a television ministry that goes into places where I'm not able to go, or Don's not able to go,
[time=636] or the choir can't go. It takes the ministry of this local church and broadens it to touch the lives of countless numbers of people.
[time=645] We need the support of a regular group of people whom we call the Founders Club.
[time=651] That is a special group of people who are committed to standing with the Bible hour on a regular monthly basis.
[time=658] Some people commit themselves to give 10, some people 50, there are some people that even give more than that, because God has enabled them to do that every month.
[time=668] Don, why don't you just tell our friends a little bit about what the Founders Club is?
[time=672] Well, Rick, the Founders Club is a group of people, like you were mentioning, who are interested in this ministry,
[time=678] and are not only interested in it in a prayer way, and watching it, but also are interested to give up their money.
[time=685] And many of you folk out there have given month after month to the Founders Club, and we appreciate that so much.
[time=691] Your gifts are needed, and they're necessary, and God is blessing your ministry.
[time=696] But then there are some of you who have not given, and you'd like to be a part of this.
[time=700] Those who are members of the Founders Club, who support us monthly, receive from our church a newsletter every month from Pastor Rick,
[time=710] and then they receive the Timeless Inserts, a devotional guide that we've been timeless insights, devotional guide that we have been talking about the last couple months,
[time=720] and then also they receive a watch word.
[time=724] It's a little kind of a plaque type thing that you fold up and put on your desk or over the sink.
[time=729] It has a scripture verse on it, and it reminds you of something that's very, very important from God's Word.
[time=735] Some of you would like to be members of the Founders Club, and we would love for you to do just that.
[time=739] If you'd like to, please write to the Bible Hour.
[time=743] That's the Bible Hour Box, 15,000, 1-500-000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15, and we'd be glad to give you information on how you can be a part of this ministry.
[time=756] Don, you know, many people have already responded and joined the Founders Club, and some people who've been longtime members have increased their commitment.
[time=765] And I just want to take this opportunity to give to you my heartfelt thank you and appreciation for being a co-labor and standing with us for the Bible Hour.
[time=776] Thank you so much for your longtime support, your faithfulness, and we appreciate your concern for our ministry of the Word of God.
[time=785] Thank you for joining us today, and now stay tuned and do not turn away as we have some very special music coming up, the song that I was telling you about that ministered to my heart so well.
[time=798] Be praying for us, particularly be praying that we'll be able to enlist and enroll over 100 new Founders Club members. I hope that you'll join me in praying towards that end.
[time=828] We'll leave more eternity to be more like your son, dear Lord. I've only just begun to be what you want me to be.
[time=857] Dear Lord, I'll live for eternity to be more like your son, dear Lord, until the grace is won.
[time=884] Be what you want me to be, Lord. I'll live so the world can sing.
[time=899] The image of your son, dear Lord, unite our hearts as one.
[time=915] Be what you want me to be, dear Lord. I'll live for eternity to be more like your son, dear Lord, until the grace of God.
[time=944] The grace of grace is won.
[time=958] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers. You always minister to my heart, but it just seems in the sovereignty of God today he uniquely chose that song because it fits right in with the concept of what we'll be studying in the Word of God.
[time=971] God called us to run a race to be like Christ, and here we have a song that teaches us that same concept. We're thankful for the ministry of music.
[time=981] In the bulletin, as you came in today, you should have noticed some special information about our television ministry.
[time=988] We're very excited about the ministry of the Bible hour and have extra reason this winter as so many people have been snowed in at their homes, and many churches were not able to meet that gave us an extended audience of people that we could share the Word of God with.
[time=1003] We're so encouraged by the kindness of our viewers and writing letters into us. We took the opportunity to lift some excerpts from each of the letters of encouragement and to share them with you.
[time=1014] There's 40 or 50 just words of encouragement and thanks that we wanted to share with you here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1022] If you're watching by way of television, we'd be glad to share it with you. If you want to write in for one of these, we'd be glad to send it your way.
[time=1030] It's a dividend just showing where our investment and our energy into television goes, and we're thankful for those words of encouragement.
[time=1038] The basic support of the television ministry comes through a group who we call the Founders Club, a group of people who faithfully support the Bible hour.
[time=1047] We put these in your hands today just so you would be aware of it, and if God would lead you to be a part of that, we're looking for a hundred new members to help our television ministry.
[time=1057] So we share that as way of information with you today. To prepare our hearts, to study God's word, Maria Gardner comes into saying a song for us that I know will speak to your heart.
[time=1068] It's a song that talks about the love of God and how He looks beyond us with our faults, our imperfections, and He sees our needs.
[time=1076] God cares for you today. He cares for you personally. He cares about you in spite of your faults, and He loves you and wants to meet your need.
[time=1086] Maria Gardner.
[time=1088] After being a Christian for 12 years, I wanted so much for my parents and my family to know Him too.
[time=1094] I was so excited the day my father told me that he and my mom had become Christians.
[time=1099] He then went to the piano and he sang a song for me that was so special, the first Christian song I ever heard him sing, a song that talks about redemption.
[time=1108] Amazing grace shall never be my song of praise.
[time=1121] For it was grace that bought my little team.
[time=1136] I do not know just why he came to have his song.
[time=1152] He looked beyond my heart and saw my near.
[time=1167] I shell for reverence, my eyes to happily.
[time=1182] To view the cross where Jesus died for me.
[time=1195] How marvelous the grapes that caught my father's sweet.
[time=1209] He looked beyond my heart and saw my near.
[time=1222] I shell for reverence, my eyes to happily.
[time=1236] To view the cross where my Jesus died for me.
[time=1250] How marvelous the grapes that caught my father's sweet.
[time=1265] He looked beyond my heart and saw my near.
[time=1295] Thank you, Maria.
[time=1302] The ministry of music is able to pierce our heart in a way that the spoken word cannot.
[time=1309] It is the ministry of music that seems to penetrate where our ears turn cold to just the spoken word.
[time=1316] God cares for you today.
[time=1318] He knows your needs, your shortcomings, your faults.
[time=1321] He cares for you, he wants to meet those needs.
[time=1325] Be best if we would take just a moment now and determine this time that we have before us over to God and ask him to speak to our hearts.
[time=1336] Our father, it is our prayer today that you would indeed speak to our hearts that as we study we would not simply study an academic pursuit.
[time=1345] There would be the spirit of God striving within our hearts, calling us to Christ, teaching us his way.
[time=1353] Oh father, may you have your way in this hour.
[time=1356] For it is in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1360] In the study of Greek mythology and Latin mythology, there are stories that are told that actually are given to illustrate principles.
[time=1370] One story is told about a young lady who was abandoned by her father and she was raised in the wilderness by a bear and grew up with a great deal of wit and cunning was beautiful and attractive.
[time=1382] So attractive that every man who saw or wanted to marry her.
[time=1386] But she did not want to marry any of them and they constantly were after her to marry them.
[time=1392] And so she devised a plan and the plan was this, because she was so fast she determined that anyone who wanted to marry her had to beat her in a foot race.
[time=1402] And then the consequence if you would lose the race was that you must die.
[time=1407] Many men tried, they failed, their life was taken.
[time=1412] But one young man truly loved her, his name Hippomenus. And Hippomenus was a fast runner, but was he fast enough to beat her.
[time=1422] He was given aid by Jason in the Argonauts and Aphrodite and they gave him three golden apples, beautiful attractive apples.
[time=1433] And as they came to the time of the race, Hippomenus hid those apples inside his garment.
[time=1438] And the gun was off and they were running and as they ran and ran she was definitely and clearly ahead of him.
[time=1445] But he reached into his garment and he rolled a golden apple out in front of her and it was so beautiful and so attractive.
[time=1451] She stopped and picked it up and looked at it, but then took off running again and caught up about halfway.
[time=1458] And so he took another of the apples and he rolled it out and knowing it was so beautiful she stopped again to collect it and pick it up.
[time=1464] And Hippomenus took the lead again, but as they neared to finish the line she had caught up and surpassed him.
[time=1471] So he took the final golden apple and rolled it on the ground in front of her.
[time=1475] And she stopped and picked it up as Hippomenus crossed the line and hid one.
[time=1481] How would was she beaten?
[time=1484] Was she beaten because he was faster?
[time=1487] Oh no, she was beaten because she was distracted from the goal.
[time=1493] Paul has described the Christian life in Philippians III chapter as a race and he encourages us to pursue it with the discipline and determination of a runner.
[time=1505] And so he writes illustrating the profile of a runner reaching for the goal and in Philippians the third chapter as we studied last week Paul said,
[time=1516] "This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, reaching forth to those things which are before, I press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[time=1530] Paul was saying, "I do not want to be distracted by what's behind me. I forget what's there and I lean as a runner leans in anticipation of the stretching of the chest to hit the finish line.
[time=1543] Paul says I lean towards my goal and that goal is to be like Jesus Christ.
[time=1549] I'm so thankful for the ministry of music that the Black Hawk singers had today that they sang, "Lord I want to be like thee."
[time=1557] That was Paul's goal and the goal that he sets down before us.
[time=1562] In this chapter 3 of Philippians we've talked about the life of the Apostle Paul verses 1 through 6 outlined for us his background.
[time=1570] Those things that he counted as gain but he now discovers that they're not assets their liabilities and he pushes them aside.
[time=1578] Then in verses 7 through 14 he talks about the new benefit in Christ.
[time=1583] He spoke about the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.
[time=1587] He spoke about the righteousness of Christ that our sins can be forgiven and God gives to us the very righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[time=1596] Very much like the story of the prince and the pauper, the two young boys who look so much alike, they were amazed when they met each other face to face.
[time=1605] Although they looked alike one young man was poor and impoverished the other a king and they exchanged places.
[time=1613] That's what Jesus Christ has done for us.
[time=1615] He the righteous son of God eternal and perfect exchanged places with me, a sinful man.
[time=1622] And I was given the garment of the righteousness of Christ.
[time=1626] Paul said that's my new benefit in him.
[time=1629] Not only is there the knowledge of Christ the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and the righteousness given but Paul said there is also the power of the resurrection to indwell us that we might run with power.
[time=1642] There's also the fellowship of his sufferings that we would be made conformable to Christ.
[time=1648] And Paul's last benefit was that he said that we should run with the goal, the benefit of the goal being Christ like.
[time=1656] However he's going to change here from verse 14 to verse 15.
[time=1661] There's an important change that distinction that we need to observe.
[time=1665] He's no longer talking in verse 15 about himself.
[time=1669] He's now speaking to his audience.
[time=1672] He changes from I and me the singular to the plural that he might include the people of Philippi but within the wisdom of God.
[time=1681] He was not just writing to a church 2000 years ago located on the Ignatian way.
[time=1686] He is writing to an eternal body of people of all believers.
[time=1690] He was writing to us today.
[time=1693] And so Paul changes with an emphasis with a direct application for you and for me.
[time=1700] He uses the pronoun we and us.
[time=1704] Verse 15 through 19 is our study for today.
[time=1709] Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded.
[time=1714] And if in anything he be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this under you.
[time=1720] Nevertheless as to which you have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same mind.
[time=1729] Brethren be followers together of me and mark them who walk even as ye have us for an example.
[time=1738] For many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.
[time=1750] Whose end is destruction?
[time=1753] Whose God is their appetite?
[time=1756] Whose glory is in their shame?
[time=1759] Whose mind earthly things?
[time=1762] Paul writes now instruction to a group of people who he loved, who he cared about.
[time=1769] And he wrote to them encouraging them to do these three things.
[time=1774] He told them what to follow, who to follow and just as importantly who not to follow.
[time=1782] Let us begin by looking at verse 15 and see who Paul says that we should follow and what we should follow.
[time=1791] He begins by saying this let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded.
[time=1796] Now it's important when you come to the Bible that you come prepared to study.
[time=1802] There's a little poster hanging one of our school rooms and it's this bear and this huge cuddly bear looking very lazy and lethargic has this caption below it.
[time=1814] And he's drinking at a fountain.
[time=1817] The caption says some come to the fountain of knowledge to drink.
[time=1822] I prefer just to gargle.
[time=1825] Just to gargle.
[time=1827] You know many come to the Bible and they don't come to drink of the Word of God.
[time=1832] They just come to gargle.
[time=1834] Maybe just a little poem today would make me feel a little better and a poem and a prayer and then a little promise to send me on my way.
[time=1843] And there are those that don't really like to study the Word of God but yet we are encouraging the Word of God to study that we might show ourselves approved.
[time=1851] A workman who needs not be ashamed rightly dividing the Word of truth.
[time=1857] May I suggest to you today that the key to your maturity in Christ is that you do more than gargle at the fountain of the Word of God.
[time=1864] But you drink and you drink with an appetite that can be never satisfied as we study this passage today.
[time=1871] It will be a study.
[time=1873] It will take work.
[time=1874] I invite you to apply your mind with me as we study.
[time=1877] Paul says let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded.
[time=1882] Now we come to that interesting word that we've talked about perfect.
[time=1886] What does the apostle Paul mean when he says perfect verse 12 he used it once before.
[time=1892] Not as though I had already attained.
[time=1894] Either were already perfect.
[time=1896] What Paul was saying here is he's using a word that speaks of maturity.
[time=1902] And he's saying I am not all that I ought to be.
[time=1905] I have not attained unto this perfect man that I will be when God resurrects me from the dead.
[time=1912] He says my goal is to live like that today but I haven't obtained.
[time=1915] I'm not completely mature yet.
[time=1918] Now if we take that meaning of maturity and we say it that's what perfection means.
[time=1923] What then did Paul mean in verse 15 when he used the same word.
[time=1927] I believe he meant the same thing.
[time=1929] Maturity.
[time=1930] Now he's talking about if you allow this term a relative sense of maturity.
[time=1935] He is saying those of you who are in the process of becoming mature the perfect man is the man who is maturing.
[time=1944] May I illustrate for you what I'm saying.
[time=1947] Relative maturity says we are what we ought to be for that stage in our life.
[time=1952] I have a little girl she's one year old one year just a little bit older.
[time=1957] And she's just an ideal little girl she lets her mother and father sleep through the night.
[time=1962] She's just ideal.
[time=1964] She's everything that a one year old ought to be.
[time=1967] She's healthy a little bit clumsy we see the doctor every week.
[time=1971] But she is just what she ought to be for a one year old.
[time=1975] Now however even though growth has taken place and she's learned to walk.
[time=1980] She's learned to say a few words.
[time=1983] She's just what she ought to be.
[time=1985] However if when she's 13 years old she's still walking around the house with a pacifier in her mouth.
[time=1991] And in diapers and she still looks at me and goes then there's a problem.
[time=1997] Why is that?
[time=1999] You know she's everything she ought to be at one year is old, 13 year old there should be different identifications that growth has taken place.
[time=2010] John writes and he says these words.
[time=2013] I write to you children.
[time=2015] I write to you young men.
[time=2017] I write to you fathers.
[time=2019] He was identifying that Christians are in different stages of growth.
[time=2023] What then is the perfect man.
[time=2025] It's the man who is in the process of growing.
[time=2028] And Paul says if a man is perfect then he'll agree or be like minded.
[time=2032] What is he agreeing with that which just Paul has spoken up.
[time=2036] That is that none of us are complete but that we are all to be strivers to be like Christ.
[time=2044] It is the mature mind that recognizes its immaturity.
[time=2050] And it is the growing man that recognizes is immaturity and seeks to grow beyond.
[time=2058] And Paul was saying those of you who are maturing growing Christians who recognize your need you're going to be of this same, same mind.
[time=2070] And in verse 16 he tells us let us walk by the same rule.
[time=2075] May I illustrate for you that a seed is everything that a seed ought to be.
[time=2080] But yet when it's planted in the ground it sends forth a stem, a little chute.
[time=2085] And that chute grows in the full blossom.
[time=2088] That's the process of maturation, of maturing.
[time=2092] And the seed of the Word of God is planted in our heart and we are born again.
[time=2096] But God's desire is not only for us to be born and to remain as an infant but that we would walk and that we would learn to grow.
[time=2104] In Christ Jesus to walk.
[time=2107] Now he recognizes something.
[time=2109] He recognizes that there were those that taught a false doctrine or maybe not taught a false doctrine but lived under a false assumption.
[time=2119] And that was that they were somehow living a perfect life today.
[time=2124] They didn't sin, they were above that, they did not sin.
[time=2128] Well first of all, may I tell you that that's not a true doctrine, no matter who you are you'll never reach that point.
[time=2135] Matter of fact John says you're in a very dangerous situation.
[time=2138] He said in 1 John chapter 1 if we say that we have not sinned the truth is not in us.
[time=2145] All Christians are in the process of striving but we're never there.
[time=2150] But if you encounter someone what do you do?
[time=2153] Paul said this and if anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal this even unto you.
[time=2161] If you don't understand that you need to grow then I pray that the Spirit of God will teach you that he'll reveal that to you that you might grow if you're otherwise minded today.
[time=2172] That's what Paul says we are to follow.
[time=2175] We are to follow the goal of being Christ like.
[time=2178] That is how we are to walk.
[time=2180] But the next phrase is where I would like to concentrate verse 17.
[time=2185] Brethren be followers together of me and mark them who walk even as you have us for an example.
[time=2194] In the area of psychology there is a study of a field what we call imprinting.
[time=2201] Imprinting is where one animal or human learns its behavior by copying the behavior of another animal or another human.
[time=2212] An interesting study was done with a little baby goose and I learned that that's called a gozling.
[time=2218] I'm not much of a farmer but Jim taught me that.
[time=2223] A little baby goose is a gozling so for you farmers here today they took a little gozling and as soon as it was born they quickly isolated.
[time=2230] So it saw no other geese.
[time=2233] They put it in the pen and they took a bladder of a ball like a basketball suspended it from a string and kept it perpetually bouncing.
[time=2240] And that's the only thing the little gozling ever saw.
[time=2244] And because it was open to imprinting and it was impressionable that little goose grew up thinking it was the bladder of a ball and went like this all of its life.
[time=2254] Why?
[time=2255] It had been imprinted upon.
[time=2257] We learn by examples more than we learn by teaching.
[time=2263] Examples.
[time=2265] I believe one of the most powerful advertisements I have ever seen is an advertisement against smoking.
[time=2271] Where there's a very attractive looking young man and his adorable little boy.
[time=2276] And the whole stage is the little boy just wants to be like daddy more than anything else.
[time=2280] So daddy's out there hosing off the car and he's right in the middle of it.
[time=2284] And daddy's walking through the woods and you can see the little boy stretching trying to make his steps laying just where daddy's laying.
[time=2291] And throughout this about 30 to 60 second commercial the little boy just copies his dad all the way.
[time=2298] And they sit down under a tree and as the dad crosses his legs the little boy does exactly the same thing.
[time=2303] And as the dad reaches down for a cigarette so does the little boy.
[time=2308] It illustrates something that we learn by example.
[time=2313] That's primarily I believe how human behavior is often learned.
[time=2318] I can remember participating in sports and many times our coach would sit us down in front of a television set
[time=2325] and he would play for us different plays that we could see them executed because you can learn a great deal
[time=2332] in athletics by studying the example of someone else.
[time=2337] Paul makes an almost unbelievable bold statement, he says this.
[time=2343] Brethren be followers together of me and mark them even as you have us for an example.
[time=2350] Paul was saying church of Philippi you want to pursue the goal being like Christ then follow me.
[time=2360] The confidence of a man who had so molded his life after Jesus Christ that he could say to others
[time=2368] you want to follow Christ then you follow me, confidence.
[time=2372] As a matter of fact there is more confidence in this little word followed than we may quickly notice.
[time=2378] This is the exact word if you just took the word right out of the language of the New Testament and changed the Greek letters in the English you would have our word mimic to copy.
[time=2388] Paul was saying you can mimic me.
[time=2392] They are proposed to you two very important questions of application today.
[time=2397] Question number one, who are you following?
[time=2401] I believe whether you are conscious of it or not at all conscious that you choose to follow other people.
[time=2408] You allow them to be your example, that is the whole marketing of advertising on television.
[time=2415] They try to make you think that if you'll use their product you'll be just like this person.
[time=2421] They try to make you think that if you've got ring around the collar just like this person's got ring around the collar and you use their detergent you won't have ring around the collar anymore and you won't be embarrassed when you see your husband go out the door.
[time=2434] Why is that? Because they are trying to create someone who you identify with and you'll say I want to be like that person
[time=2442] because we as human beings copy our behavior.
[time=2445] May I ask you today who are you following?
[time=2448] I believe that it's important in every one of our lives that we have heroes but I believe it's important that we carefully select our heroes.
[time=2459] Teenagers are hero worshipers.
[time=2462] If you go into the room of an average teenager you will find on almost every wall
[time=2468] either posters are cut out to the magazine of their favorite sports heroes or their favorite personality who is popular because of the media.
[time=2478] They're hero worshipers.
[time=2480] You know we as adults are just a little bit more settled but we are still hero worshipers too.
[time=2486] And what God is saying through the inspiration of the Apostle Paul is it's good to follow examples.
[time=2491] It's just important that we pay out who our example is.
[time=2497] The story is told about two lawyers who were arguing over which one's religion was better than the other and why you should go this way and he shouldn't go that way and the one lawyer said to the other.
[time=2507] Well if you know so much about the Bible tell me what the Lord's prayer is.
[time=2512] He said I know a lot about the Bible. It goes like this.
[time=2514] Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
[time=2517] The lawyer said boy you do know a lot about the Bible.
[time=2519] I guess I'll follow you to your church after all.
[time=2522] That's important that you pick out the right examples.
[time=2526] You know God says that our life is to be one of stepping or someone else stepped.
[time=2532] There was a man who became an example of my life shortly after I became a Christian.
[time=2537] He was the pastor who led me to Christ. His name was David Burnham.
[time=2541] And I'm sure that he didn't realize that I was sitting there ignoring every word that he said
[time=2548] just wanting to be like him.
[time=2551] You know it wasn't at the time that I was having those attitudes that I was even aware of him.
[time=2556] It wasn't until days went by that I realized that within my heart I wanted to be like this man.
[time=2562] It helped that he was an all-American football player and I was a scrawny little kid.
[time=2566] There was a little bit of attraction there but even his godliness I wanted to be like him.
[time=2571] He became my hero in the faith.
[time=2575] You know God outlines heroes force in Hebrews chapter 11 and they are set down as in samples.
[time=2581] That means examples that we should follow after them.
[time=2585] Who are your heroes today?
[time=2588] It's so important that you select wisely your heroes.
[time=2593] I say something to you young men and young ladies that just because an individual can carry a football
[time=2599] or they can dunk a basketball or they can play a music instrument.
[time=2603] Not to allow them to be your hero until you've examined the conduct and the character of their life.
[time=2609] If there's anything that concerns me about the music of this day and the television shows of this day,
[time=2616] it is the subtle transfer of allegiance and identification to people who are not examples that we should follow.
[time=2626] I'm far less concerned about the overtness and illusions to immorality on television
[time=2634] as I am concerned about the subtle way that it is made acceptable to us.
[time=2641] The way it's made humorous and the way people are portrayed as cool and free
[time=2647] and you want to be like them in every way and since they are sexually active if you want to be like them then you should be sexually active and our minds are being bombarded from the time the airwaves come on in the morning until they go off at night with models that are counter-dictory to the model God would have us to follow.
[time=2666] Is it a sin to watch television? No, please don't turn it off.
[time=2670] Is it a sin to pick the wrong examples? My friends, it's not only sin but it could be the most dangerous thing you could do in your life is to select the wrong example.
[time=2680] And Paul was able to say with confidence be followers of me.
[time=2684] Even as I'm a follower of Christ and he says Mark others he probably was speaking of Timothy and a paphrodite is two men that are mentioned in the book as godly servants but he was saying Mark out others that we might imprint, we might lead others by our example.
[time=2703] But there's another question besides the question, who are you following?
[time=2709] The question is what example are you setting for others to follow?
[time=2716] Do you know today that there are others that are measuring what Christianity is by you?
[time=2723] By your example, by your conduct, you're setting a pattern?
[time=2728] If you knew my father you would not only observe that we are very similar in physical size.
[time=2733] I'm five eight and a half, he's five nine. I'm not going to tell you he weighs about the exact same amount
[time=2741] just about ten more pounds more than the scale says you're supposed to weigh.
[time=2745] He weighs about the same, we wear the same size suit coat, we have the same type of curly hair
[time=2751] but it's not just physical appearance that you can link to genetics.
[time=2755] There's also a great deal of similarities in our philosophy of life.
[time=2761] My father taught us that if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing right and boy that was drilled into my head
[time=2768] and now I have that same value, that same sense of determination.
[time=2772] My dad was an athlete and it's not just a matter of learning athletic skills but I love the things that he loves.
[time=2779] I learn not only physical things but actual personality characteristics because my father's example was set in front of me.
[time=2787] I learned some philosophy and concept of the ministry because of David Burnham.
[time=2792] People are learning their philosophy and they're concept of a Christian by their examination of my life
[time=2799] and yes, your life and it's important that we be examples that lead people in the straight paths.
[time=2808] I think if there was ever a church that had caused to be proud, it was the Church of Antioch.
[time=2815] For in the study of the book of Acts, the Christians were called followers of the way.
[time=2821] Until Acts 11 and there at Antioch, they were first called Christians.
[time=2828] What an honor because you see the word Christian means to be like or a little Christian, Christ, little Christ Christian.
[time=2838] What was happening is those people were so Christ-like in their conduct and their behavior that people said they're just like Christ.
[time=2847] What a compliment.
[time=2849] Oh, that people could know by the conduct of our life and the example that we leave
[time=2855] where we stand, where we're at spiritually, that we would have a fit example.
[time=2863] Stories told about a man whose habit was every day to read the obituaries
[time=2869] and all his friends knew that was the first thing that he did every day, year upon year, and so they played a joke on him and they ran an obituary with his picture and a biographical study of his life.
[time=2881] He picked up the paper and read his own obituary one morning, called his friend said, "Did you read the morning paper?" He said, "I sure did. Tell me, Fred, where are you calling from anyway?"
[time=2893] You know, I'd like to die in people to know that if I called where I was calling from.
[time=2897] Now, if I die, don't expect a phone call, but I'd like there to be something in my life that people would know where I was and where I stood, how my steps were ordered.
[time=2907] God says that he uses us as examples, and the question we must ask is what type of example
[time=2913] are we living and leading?
[time=2916] Verse 18, "For many walk of whom I have told you often,
[time=2922] and now I tell you, even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ."
[time=2928] Paul was saying, "Now you have to mark your example carefully, because you are surrounded by men who are enemies of the cross of Christ." He was not speaking of people outside the Roman emperor who had persecuted them, the Roman centurion who had pushed them into the lion's pit.
[time=2945] I believe he was speaking about those within the church who were actual enemies for Christ.
[time=2951] Bertrand Russell wrote a book entitled "Why I Am Not a Christian" is a statement against Christianity.
[time=2961] But I believe that there are far more dangerous people here this morning than Bertrand Russell.
[time=2967] Bertrand Russell never claimed to be a Christian.
[time=2970] The people who are the true enemies and the dangerous ones are the ones that wear the name and play the game.
[time=2977] They're the ones who we call the mere professors, but not real possessors of the Son of God.
[time=2984] So Paul's got to describe them in four ways.
[time=2988] First he says that their end is destruction.
[time=2992] Their final destination is self-destruction.
[time=2996] It's the word perdition to be damnable, to be sent to hell.
[time=3000] And he says the end of their life is destruction, what they pursue will lead them to destruction.
[time=3007] Secondly, he says that they are those whose God is their belly.
[time=3014] I like the Scofield wondering it says whose God is their appetite.
[time=3018] Far more than just the growling of their stomach, but their appetite, the things that they want.
[time=3024] We've made many mistakes in the raising of our children, and one of them was to use this type of logic with Rachel, our two-year-old.
[time=3031] When we wanted to do something, we'd say, "Honey, would you take this and put it in your room?" That would make Daddy so happy and proud of you.
[time=3038] Well, she learned that logic very quickly.
[time=3041] And now she'll walk over and say, "I'd like a cookie." And I say, "Rachel, you can't have a cookie to dinner." But it would make me so happy.
[time=3050] And you try to deny her that, and she can use that line.
[time=3054] I mean, the wit and the talent, you know, the tears at the right time.
[time=3058] And she doesn't do it demandingly. She does it so hurt and bruised.
[time=3061] And she always, when she wants something, will preface it.
[time=3064] It would make me happy if Rachel could have, and then she tags on whatever she wants.
[time=3070] I'll tell you, that can get to a father.
[time=3074] But after about the 42nd time, I find myself Rachel.
[time=3078] I'm not primarily concerned about whether you're happy.
[time=3083] It's time for you to go to bed.
[time=3087] It's 9.30. We've gone to the bathroom.
[time=3089] We've had to drink of water. We've prayed for everything, including the window.
[time=3093] It is time to go to bed. I don't care what would make you happy.
[time=3098] You know, we joke. And that's all right in the two-year-old.
[time=3101] But, you know, there are Christians.
[time=3103] They got to make me happy, and they want to live by that philosophy.
[time=3108] There are not only those who are Christians, but it's the philosophy of our age.
[time=3112] That what determines my sense of values, my sense of ethics is it makes me happy.
[time=3118] Now, we laugh and it's sure about child.
[time=3121] It's the philosophy of the day.
[time=3123] And there are those that even try to rename Christianity as to say that Jesus died to make you happy.
[time=3132] I believe Jesus died to give you eternal life, and that if you know him, they'll come a sense of joy.
[time=3137] But he didn't die primarily to make you happy today.
[time=3141] Jesus died that he might forgive you of your sins, and you might learn to walk in obedience to him.
[time=3146] I'm far more concerned as a parent about whether my little girl Rachel is happy with a cookie or not.
[time=3153] I'm concerned of developing value and character and Christ-likeness in her life.
[time=3158] And far more concerned God is than if we'd be happy, as if we walk in obedience to Christ.
[time=3164] And there's a distinction between those whose desires to run a race to be like Christ and those whose God is their appetite.
[time=3173] Thirdly, he said whose glory is their shame, whose glory is their shame.
[time=3182] You know, there are people today that boast about that, which God says is sin and is shame.
[time=3190] And here again is the great danger of the media, of television.
[time=3195] Because it presents in a situational comedy, a hero, a hero who violates biblical standards,
[time=3203] and because of that, he is able to boast of his conquest.
[time=3209] The subtleness that comes and our heroes become villains, and our villains become heroes.
[time=3217] And the person who is ridiculed in the situational comedy is a person who has values and who lives by their values.
[time=3224] And the person who is a hero and who is glorified and exalted is the person who lives amorally.
[time=3232] And the glory in that which God says is their shame.
[time=3237] And finally those who mind earthly things.
[time=3241] Paul wrote to Timothy and he warned him about a man by the name of Demas.
[time=3245] He says Demas loves this present age.
[time=3249] Is it wrong to enjoy life?
[time=3251] I enjoy life. I enjoy too many things.
[time=3254] I have trouble getting through the day accomplishing all the things that are fulfilling and meaningful to me.
[time=3261] But at the same time, I know that the attraction of this world is always vying for my attention,
[time=3268] like three golden apples thrown out in a race to bait a runner.
[time=3273] There's always going to be something there to attract your attention, to draw you away from Christ.
[time=3278] To draw you away from Christ's likeness.
[time=3281] And there's always going to be in a church.
[time=3285] In this church, hypocrites, I walked into a hospital one day to greet a man who was hospitalized before I could say a word.
[time=3294] He said a lot of hypocrites in your church.
[time=3298] I said yeah, there are. One of them came to see you today.
[time=3302] I'm not what I ought to be.
[time=3305] I know that I'm an example to you. By the grace of God, I'm striving to be what I ought to be.
[time=3310] But with John Newton, I say, I'm not what I ought to be. I'm not what I want to be.
[time=3315] But by the grace of God, I'm not what I once was either.
[time=3319] And yes, there are hypocrites.
[time=3321] Yes, there are those who do not possess Christ as Savior, but they name the name and they play the game.
[time=3328] Men, if you're hiding today behind the fact that there are hypocrites, you're in great danger.
[time=3334] The southern preacher by the name of Robert G. Lee told the story of a submarine by the name of the squallist that sang to the bottom.
[time=3342] 240 foot deep.
[time=3345] They sent up a flare that sent die throughout the water in a buoy that went up and for 24 hours.
[time=3351] No hope was coming.
[time=3354] But finally, another submarine identified the spot and they lowered down the 10 ton diving hill that attached to the submarine squallist that was suffering.
[time=3363] And a few at a time, men could get into the bell and they were lifted up.
[time=3368] Robert G. Lee made this point.
[time=3370] He said there was not one man on that sunken sub that said, I won't get on that diving bell because a lot of the men and the other sub are hypocrites.
[time=3383] They simply went or there was a lifeline extended in a way of escape.
[time=3389] Jesus Christ offers a lifeline and a way of escape.
[time=3394] He wants to save you of your sins and forgive you and to make you whole.
[time=3399] Don't hide behind the fact that someone else is a hypocrite.
[time=3404] Or that someone else isn't all that they said they would be.
[time=3409] All men and women, we are sinking, deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore.
[time=3416] Jesus Christ seeks to rescue us.
[time=3419] He reaches down from heaven with a lifeline and said, who swerve would believe in him?
[time=3423] Should not perish, but should have everlasting life.
[time=3427] And don't hide today behind someone else, the shortcomings.
[time=3434] Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[time=3438] Will you serve the God of your appetite and run a race of pursuit, a fame and fortune?
[time=3444] Will you run a race in pursuit of Jesus Christ?
[time=3448] Who will you serve today?
[time=3451] Let's pray together.
[time=3454] Let's pray and receive him as Savior.
[time=3462] Invite him into your heart.
[time=3465] The very heart of today's message has been for those who know Christ to follow him.
[time=3471] But perhaps this morning you have not received him.
[time=3474] I pray at this time you will open up your heart and receive Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=3480] You won't hide behind anyone else, any cloak like someone else is a hypocrite.
[time=3486] I pray that you will receive him today.
