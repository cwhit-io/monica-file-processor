[time=0] [DING]
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=41] They're preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=52] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=57] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=68] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=78] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=87] We welcome at this time our friends who are joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=93] During the service today, we'll be looking forward to hearing from a special guest, Mr. Bert Kettinger.
[time=99] He's a man of tremendous commitment to Jesus Christ and the talent in the area of music that I know will do much to strengthen each of us in our hearts.
[time=109] We're looking forward to missions conference coming.
[time=111] Our theme has touched the world through me.
[time=114] And we have this beautiful logo, our theme this year, that was made for us by Mr. Robinson.
[time=120] And the theme is an appropriate theme that we would desire that God touched the world through each one of us.
[time=126] The name of Jesus Christ is worthy to be proclaimed.
[time=130] And so the choir leads us this morning.
[time=133] And a great hymn taken from the book of Revelation, "Worthy is the Lamb," our sanctuary choir under the direction of Mr. Don Krueger.
[time=142] ("Worthy is the Lamb," "Worthy is the Lamb,"")
[time=169] [MUSIC - 350 seconds]
[time=529] And thank you for that good singing.
[time=531] It is always a delight for us to have Mr. Burke Kettinger here.
[time=535] He sings on the Moody Bible Institute station.
[time=538] And those of you who are listening on the television from the Chicago area, he is a friend of yours, I'm sure you've heard him many times.
[time=545] It's always a delight for us to have Burke with us.
[time=548] We're glad you're here. Blessings on you, brother.
[time=550] Thank you, Don. I always enjoy coming back to Black Hawk.
[time=553] And I confess I've been especially excited about coming back this time because among other things this past year in recording a new album, I used one of Don Kruger's songs, and I just had to come and sing it.
[time=566] I really appreciate Don and his spirit and his leadership in the ministry of music here in this church.
[time=571] And that's meant much to me and his friendship has meant much as well.
[time=575] But this song is included in a medley of songs regarding the name of Jesus.
[time=580] The name the Bible tells us that is above every name.
[time=583] And of course to us who know him, that name is so very, very special.
[time=588] And I want to sing about that.
[time=590] [MUSIC]
[time=600] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=608] There's just something about that name.
[time=618] Master, Savior, Jesus.
[time=626] Like the fragrant after the rain.
[time=636] Jesus, Jesus, oh Jesus.
[time=644] Let all heaven and earth proclaim.
[time=654] Kings and kingdoms shall all pass away.
[time=662] But there's something about that name.
[time=671] That beautiful name.
[time=675] That wonderful name.
[time=680] From sin has power to free us.
[time=689] That beautiful name.
[time=694] That wonderful name.
[time=700] That matchless name is Jesus.
[time=715] What a beautiful name is Jesus.
[time=721] What a beautiful name to me.
[time=728] Whisper to the Virgin Mary heralded by choirs of angels.
[time=734] Name of him who came to save his people from their sins.
[time=739] What a beautiful name.
[time=742] A wonderful name.
[time=745] What a beautiful, wonderful name is Jesus.
[time=756] Yes, there's something about that name.
[time=771] A Jesus.
[time=779] What a delight it is to hear Bert Kenninger sing for us this morning.
[time=784] What a delight it is too to have you joining us for the Bible hour.
[time=789] Don, what type of voice would you say Bert Kenninger has?
[time=794] Besides absolutely beautiful, it's a baritone, a bass baritone voice.
[time=798] Isn't that a rich voice?
[time=801] Boy, it really is.
[time=802] I wish that I had one of those bravo majestic voices.
[time=804] I sound more like a squeaky little guy.
[time=806] You do okay.
[time=808] Well, that's because you're coaching me along and I appreciate that.
[time=811] It was all over and this month of March was going to come in like a lamb and stay like a lamb.
[time=816] Came in like a lamb but the lion came roaring back this week and many of us are blue and discouraged with all the snow.
[time=824] Well, I'm glad to be here myself and I think we're going to have a good congregation in spite of it.
[time=828] I'm sure we will.
[time=830] Speaking of the need to encourage each other during this time of winter and snow, we have a booklet that we'd like to share with you.
[time=837] It's called Your Ministry of Encouragement.
[time=840] There is a spiritual gift listed in the Bible, the gift of helps and I believe encouragement falls under that general idea of helping one another.
[time=850] This book is written by Dr. Clyde Nairmore.
[time=853] He's the president of the Nairmore Christian Foundation and many of us know of that because of Dr. Ken who had gone to that school.
[time=861] And this is a nonprofit organization devoted to the preventing and solving of human problems.
[time=866] It's a tremendous little book, Your Ministry of Encouragement.
[time=869] We've been offering different pamphlets and books on our Bible Hour telecast and you have been very responsive and you've written in for them.
[time=878] And I'm sure you're not going to want to miss this little book.
[time=881] If you would like to have it, please write to the Bible Hour box, 15,000, 1500,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=893] This is the kind of book that will be helpful to anyone.
[time=896] It talks about how that we should be encouraging our spouses.
[time=900] We should be encouraging our teachers, encouraging our friends, encouraging one another.
[time=904] A tremendous little book that meets the needs of just about anybody who watches the Bible Hour.
[time=909] One particular section in here that caught my attention was describing how grandparents can be using their time and their talent to encourage their family.
[time=919] And we hope that you'll write for this booklet today. As Don mentioned, Dr. Naramore is a close friend of Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=927] Many of you have written in and received a copy of Remedies for Negative Thinking, which Dr. Ken wrote.
[time=933] This is a book very similar in nature and I know will be helpful for you.
[time=938] Don, what should we be looking for musically in the rest of our service?
[time=942] Well, Burke Kettinger is going to be singing again and then we have a choral reading by some of our young people from our school.
[time=949] By the way, talking about school, isn't it time for registration?
[time=953] It is. Here at the Black Hawk Christian School, we are in the time of registering students for next year.
[time=959] And if you have any interest, make sure you listen later on in today's service as we will tell you exactly how you can do that.
[time=967] We look forward each week to having our time of encouragement with you.
[time=972] I believe the true source of any encouragement comes when people lovingly care about each other and share principles from the Word of God towards building up each other's lives.
[time=983] We're looking forward to sharing with you the Word of God as it's spoken in a choral reading as Burke leads us in providing music that will speak of the love of God.
[time=992] And today as I share with you how you can triumph through perspective.
[time=997] The Bible says that Jesus Christ is coming again and that should change our perspective.
[time=1002] It should give us an anticipation each day looking for Jesus Christ to come again.
[time=1008] And when he comes, he's going to make us into a new being to give us new bodies like his.
[time=1014] I'm looking forward to this opportunity to sharing with you what Jesus Christ has in our future.
[time=1021] Again, if you would like this booklet, your Ministry of Encouragement, right to us today at the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1032] The area code or excuse me, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1037] Thank you and God bless you.
[time=1062] [MUSIC - 223 seconds]
[time=1303] Thank you, and what a reminder that Jesus Christ is to be the pursuit of our life.
[time=1314] And to be like him is the goal and the pattern that Jesus Christ has set before us.
[time=1321] And God's given us his scriptures that we might know him, that we might learn to walk as he walked.
[time=1327] And one of the beauty of the scriptures is to hear them read.
[time=1330] And so we have a group of students from our own school, Black Hawk Christian School, who are going to come and present the Word of God in a living way.
[time=1338] It's called a scriptural chorus.
[time=1341] You may be familiar with choral readings.
[time=1343] These students from our speech class are going to present the 23rd and 24th Psalm
[time=1349] in a way that presents the majesty of the Word of God.
[time=1356] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=1359] He made it me to lie down in green pastures.
[time=1362] He leadeth me beside the still watchers.
[time=1364] He restored my soul.
[time=1366] He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[time=1370] Gave though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[time=1375] For thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[time=1380] Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[time=1385] Thou anointedst my head with oil, my cup runeth over.
[time=1389] Surely through this immersy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[time=1400] The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof, the world, and the day that dwell therein.
[time=1407] For he hath found the dick upon the seas and established it upon the floods.
[time=1413] Who shall sinned into the hill of the Lord?
[time=1416] Or who shall stand in his holy place?
[time=1420] Give me the hand and a pure heart.
[time=1426] Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully?
[time=1435] Who shall receive the blessings from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation?
[time=1444] This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob.
[time=1450] Lift up your heads.
[time=1452] O ye gaze.
[time=1453] And be ye lift up.
[time=1455] Ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
[time=1459] Who is this King of glory?
[time=1462] The Lord strong and mighty.
[time=1464] The Lord mighty in battle.
[time=1467] Lift up your heads, O ye gaze.
[time=1470] Even lift them up ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.
[time=1476] Who is this King of glory?
[time=1481] The Lord of hosts.
[time=1483] He is the King of glory.
[time=1485] Thank you, students.
[time=1492] The Word of God, and particularly the Psalms, were given not only that we might meditate upon them in our own heart,
[time=1499] but they were given to be proclaimed.
[time=1501] Some of the Psalms are addressed to the chief musician.
[time=1504] They were to be sung, they were to be spoken, and they were to be taught.
[time=1508] If you have an interest in Black Hawk Christian School, this is the time of year when we're registering new students,
[time=1514] and we'd love to have you call our church or school office.
[time=1517] The number is 749-8524.
[time=1521] Some of the classes are already filling up, and so if you are interested, we would encourage you to call quickly.
[time=1529] Mr. Bert Kettinger comes to prepare our hearts to study God's Word.
[time=1533] This morning, we'll be studying the expectation of heaven, and so he sings for us about that same truth.
[time=1555] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=1725] Thank you, Bert.
[time=1736] Just think of standing on shore and finding it heaven.
[time=1740] Apostle Paul wrote about heaven, wrote about the believer's identification with heaven,
[time=1746] the believer's anticipation, and expectation.
[time=1750] We come to our study of the Word of God.
[time=1752] Today we'll be looking at verses number 20 and 21 of Philippians the third chapter
[time=1760] and wanting to fit in with what the Word of God and the Spirit of God was going to have in this place.
[time=1766] Bert selected this song for Philippians 3 verse 20 says, "For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1779] who shall change our lowly body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body,
[time=1785] according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
[time=1795] Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 through 21.
[time=1800] Last week as we studied through the book of Philippians we came to some men who Paul commended
[time=1806] as examples to be followed.
[time=1808] He also identified some men that were not to be followed.
[time=1812] He described them in these ways.
[time=1814] He said their end is destruction.
[time=1817] Their God is their appetite, their glory is their shame who mind fourthly earthly things.
[time=1827] Earthly things.
[time=1829] And so verse 20 comes as a point of contrast.
[time=1833] Contrasted to those who mind earthly things we have our citizenship in heaven.
[time=1841] It's a matter of perspective, of identification and developing a reference point.
[time=1848] Every experience of life is determined not by that experience alone but by the experience of perspective.
[time=1858] It was over a decade ago that a spaceship circumorbed the moon.
[time=1864] The group of Russian cosmonauts said we've traveled through space and we have found no God.
[time=1872] No God.
[time=1874] It was near that same event.
[time=1877] The United States astronauts also circumorbited the moon.
[time=1883] And from their spaceship they sent a message back to earth and they read these words.
[time=1890] In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=1896] And they went on to quote Genesis 1 saying that God was indeed the creator of the earth.
[time=1905] The glory of the heavens show forth his handiwork.
[time=1909] Two groups of men.
[time=1911] One group of men went around the moon and they said we saw no God therefore there is no God.
[time=1918] Another group of men had the exact same experience.
[time=1922] Left this planet, went around the moon and they came and they said there is a God.
[time=1927] We've seen evidence of creative power.
[time=1930] Same experience.
[time=1932] What determined their attitude was their perspective.
[time=1937] Perspective is important in life.
[time=1940] We must choose our perspective.
[time=1942] Abraham Lincoln said that a horse is a good looking animal.
[time=1947] That is depending upon which end you are looking at.
[time=1950] Perspective makes a big difference.
[time=1953] We had a Siberian Husky in our family.
[time=1956] It was my sister's dog.
[time=1958] That poor dog living in Akron, Ohio a climate just like here in Fort Wayne had some miserable summers.
[time=1964] The dog was not at home.
[time=1967] And in the winter time it was just beginning to get comfortable.
[time=1970] But if we should get a big blizzard I mean just a deluge of snow.
[time=1975] And the temperature would drop far below zero.
[time=1977] That dog would gleefully run out into the snow, sit down in the biggest snow drift it could find and how with contentment.
[time=1986] It would dive notes first into the snow and just come up buried and it was as if the dog could laugh and smile because it was a Siberian Husky.
[time=1995] And it was at home.
[time=1998] I was freezing to death.
[time=2000] You see identification of perspective makes a difference in how we view a given circumstance.
[time=2008] Paul is writing to a group of people.
[time=2010] He's instructed them to follow the pattern of Christ.
[time=2013] He said to follow the example of godly men in Christ.
[time=2017] But now he speaks about perspective and that they were not to lose their perspective.
[time=2024] So in verse 20 he speaks of the perspective of identification.
[time=2030] He says for our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2035] That was a good word to use to the church of Philippi.
[time=2038] We need to understand that as god gave his word he gave it to all men of all peoples of all time.
[time=2044] But it's not just a mystical book that came from under a rock, it is a book that was born in human spirit directed by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2054] And there was a real man in history by the name of the Apostle Paul who wrote a letter to a real group of people the church at Philippi.
[time=2064] This letter is called the letter to the Philippians the people of Philippi.
[time=2070] And Paul chose this word citizenship of heaven because these people of Philippi were a unique people.
[time=2077] When the Roman military might would expand throughout the Mediterranean world they would capture and dominate the world.
[time=2085] And each city was brought under their domination from them was extracted not only allegiance but taxes for they were conquered people from every city.
[time=2096] Philippi was not such a city. It was not a conquered city. It was a Roman colony founded by Philipp the Macedonian.
[time=2106] Years later in 42 BC when the combined forces of Octavian later to be called Caesar Augustus along with Mark Anthony and 42 BC defeated the powers of Brutus and Cassius.
[time=2119] They established a military bounty. A land benefit for those who had served in the army a reward they gave them land and position in Roman colonies the colony of Philippi.
[time=2132] And so Philippi was not a conquered city it was a colony therefore if you went to that city you would discover that it was a miniature Rome.
[time=2141] They did not speak the indigenous language of the Greeks they spoke Latin the language of Rome.
[time=2147] They did not dress and adhere to the culture of the Greeks they were Romans and they maintained their unique identity.
[time=2155] They did not adopt the goddess system of the mythological pantheon of the Greeks they maintained their Roman concept of religion.
[time=2165] They were citizens of Rome and so as they were reminded that whatever they said in whatever they did they were at all times Romans Paul selects that same phraseology to say you are not citizens of earth you are citizens of heaven.
[time=2185] The Romans faced unique pressure to be squeezed into the same format as the Greeks that surrounded them but their call was to maintain their Roman identity.
[time=2198] I love how the paraphrase living bible treats Romans 12 1 and 2 it says don't let this world squeeze you into its mold but be a uniquely different person.
[time=2213] That's what Paul was saying you are part of this world but don't let this world squeeze you into its mold there are those whose God is their belly but that should not be you.
[time=2224] There are those that glory in their shame but that should not be you.
[time=2228] There are those whose mind and affection is set upon earthly things but in contrast our citizenship our identification is in heaven.
[time=2240] So perspective identification determines behavior. I believe that within the world in which we live we are observed as Christians to determine our identification.
[time=2254] I really believe that people look at us and they are looking for two things a combination of these thoughts.
[time=2263] The first thing they are looking for is someone who is real genuine as both feet on the earth who understands life who is a participant not someone who is isolated and withdrawn someone who they may say is so heavenly minded they are no earthly good.
[time=2281] The world is looking for someone who is successful, aggressive and an accomplisher and a participant in this life but someone who is at the same time different than they are.
[time=2298] Someone who is confident but not arrogant someone who is full of conviction but not full of condemnation someone who is meek but not weak.
[time=2315] Men who are men but not macho men, gentlemen if you will. The world is looking for an individual who is a combination of someone who is just like them but who is different from them in their identification.
[time=2334] The prayer of my life for you and for me is this God make me so common that every man can identify with me but make me so unique that my lifestyle demands an explanation.
[time=2349] That's what it means to be a citizen of heaven.
[time=2354] I saw a film about the life of Tom Landry, coach of the Dallas Cowboys. Films about 10 years old so the personalities are a bit outdated.
[time=2365] But the film is about the identification of a personality, of a man tremendously successful, a man who is excelled in his realm of employment, football coach.
[time=2378] They go from individual player to individual player asking them to identify what it is that they see in coach Tom Landry.
[time=2386] And they talked about his intellectual capabilities, they talked about his understanding of the game, they talked about his ability with people, they talked about his expertise and his discipline but the man that really hit the punchline was Walt Garrison
[time=2400] who stuttering and staring and said well coach Landry, what coach is, well Mr. Landry, well he's a Christian, he's a Christian.
[time=2410] There was something about Tom Landry, not only represented him as one of the greatest football coaches, but his lifestyle identified him as a Christian.
[time=2420] It's a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul was saying that our citizenship, King James, our conversation, our way of life, our identification is in heaven.
[time=2433] You know if your identification is in heaven that gives you a completely different perspective on life than if you're like the people on verse 19 who mind earthly things.
[time=2444] You know it begins to affect your values, you begin to think differently, you begin to treasure different things, you begin to hunger for different appetites.
[time=2456] Does the individual who is not born into the kingdom of God have a hunger for the Word of God? No he does not, it's foreign to him.
[time=2464] That comes when the Spirit of God comes in our life because he's a citizen of a new kingdom. Paul was saying to maintain the perspective of our identification.
[time=2475] Not only does he speak though about identification, he speaks of anticipation.
[time=2482] He said for our citizenship is in heaven from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2491] Do you know distinctly unique about the early church different from those of us gathered in this auditorium?
[time=2497] Was there eager, hopeful anticipation that Jesus Christ was coming again?
[time=2504] Let's read about that in the book of Thessalonians chapter 4, 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, a similar letter written by Paul, just as Philippi was written by Paul.
[time=2516] Written to a Greek people, Paul was writing in one place to Philippi, now he's writing to Thessalonica, another city, not too far removed.
[time=2526] In chapter 4 verse 16 he says this, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=2541] Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
[time=2550] Within the study of the Bible we call this doctrine, the doctrine of the rapture.
[time=2556] It says this that at any moment it could be right now, it could be another thousand years that at an unannounced moment Jesus Christ is coming.
[time=2570] He's coming to the clouds, there'll be a universal proclamation, the shouting of the archangel, the blowing of the trump of God, and miraculously every dead believer will ascend to be with him, and right on their heels will be those Christians who are alive.
[time=2585] That was the hope of the early church.
[time=2588] Now we don't have a great deal of need for that, because we're so comfortable, and while I love comfort we need to be careful that comfort does not lead to complacency.
[time=2599] I must be honest with you, it's not very many times that I sit and I say, "Oh I wish the Lord Jesus were coming today."
[time=2608] Do you know why that truth is strangely absent in your life and mine?
[time=2614] It's because we're so comfortable.
[time=2616] The early church was not comfortable, they were being persecuted, they were fed to the lions, they were impaled on a pole, lit as a torch at Nero's garden parties.
[time=2626] They were persecuted and distressed and cast down on every side.
[time=2630] They suffered peril and famine, nakedness, persecution, sword, they were sawn asunder, and so their hope was that Jesus was coming at any moment.
[time=2640] It's the hope of the church today.
[time=2642] You know the times when I want Jesus Christ to come again are not as often as they should be, because I'm too comfortable.
[time=2650] Well I can remember days when I hope he was coming, particularly a day when I sat as a seminary student with a Hebrew exam in my hand, and I wasn't sure which was the top and which was the bottom of the page.
[time=2662] Oh I wanted Jesus Christ to come back, sweet deliverance.
[time=2667] But you know there are those today who want him to come.
[time=2670] They want him to come now, because they don't have the comfort that we have.
[time=2675] There are people in this body who they are, there are loved ones being destroyed with the agony and the pain of cancer.
[time=2683] There are those that don't have loving family that support them and stand by them.
[time=2689] They suffer the brokenness and the trauma of relationships that have been torn apart.
[time=2693] There's a hurt in life and there's no comfort.
[time=2696] There are those that leave this culture and go to Poland or Russia or the continent of Africa and in unique countries like Uganda, where there's not freedom to meet like this.
[time=2709] You cannot name the name of Christ.
[time=2712] Freedom, there's persecution, and they look with anticipation that he's coming.
[time=2719] And how does an individual face the trauma and the brokenness and the pain of life?
[time=2724] They face it with the perspective of anticipation that he is coming and he's coming for me.
[time=2732] When is he coming? I don't know.
[time=2735] The Scripture says he comes as a thief in the night.
[time=2740] If we knew when the thief was coming we'd call the police and have them there to greet us.
[time=2745] We'd protect and prepare ourselves. We'd make every sure defense.
[time=2750] Like the Amishman who woke up in the middle of the night, picked up a school hunting rifle and went down to greet the thief.
[time=2756] And he said, "Thou knowest I be Amish and they'll knowest I be against violence, but they'll stand us where I'm about to shoot."
[time=2763] We'd make preparation.
[time=2767] We'd know that Jesus is coming and we'd live one type of lifestyle then in anticipation.
[time=2772] We would change because we'd know when he was coming.
[time=2774] He said, "Live and hope and confidence because I will come." I may say a word to you folks, that there is a great deal of interest on March the 10th.
[time=2785] That's the day when Jesus Christ is coming because Jupiter lies with March and the Jupiter effect is going to have so much of a gravitational pull
[time=2793] that the whole world's gonna end and Jesus coming.
[time=2796] May I say to you that that's an interesting concept, but the word of God says that no man knows the hour nor the time.
[time=2803] Now, if you're watching this broadcast in Chicago or South Bend, you can chuckle because it's already March 21st.
[time=2810] For those of us here, it's only the seventh and but in three days we'll be all right.
[time=2815] Jesus will come when no one thinks he'll come.
[time=2818] So soon as someone says, "I know when he's coming," you say, "Thank you.
[time=2821] Now I know when he's not coming because you can't know." You know, it's interesting that throughout history people have always said, "I know, I know, I know, and they've been wrong.
[time=2832] But he will come. He will come and he will rapture us out of here." Well, it's so important to be careful of the dates.
[time=2841] God says, "No one will know. I got a chuckle one day as I was listening to the radio." And there was this preacher meaning well, but he was sure that a certain individual was the Antichrist,
[time=2852] and he had research and come up with all this proof of why this individual was the Antichrist.
[time=2857] His broadcast was also two weeks delayed. And in the two weeks before his recording and the broadcast, the guy up and died on him, and that really messed up an otherwise brilliant work of scholarship.
[time=2869] I don't know when he's coming, but I do know that he is coming, and that brings to us a perspective of anticipation.
[time=2878] Then finally, Paul said that there is the perspective of expectation, verse 21, Jesus Christ,
[time=2886] who himself so change our lowly body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious body,
[time=2892] according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[time=2899] What is the expectation? Jesus Christ is going to change us. He's going to change us.
[time=2905] Many of you like alliteration, so I've got four Ps to share with you under this concept of expectation.
[time=2912] The first thing that I would share with you is here as a promise of God, that he's going to take our bodies,
[time=2918] and he's going to remake him like his body, that we're going to have a different body in heaven, a glorified body is the language of the Scripture.
[time=2928] We put a great deal of emphasis in our culture on the body.
[time=2932] There's a deodorant that will make you more sexy and will make people attractive to you.
[time=2937] There's a toothpaste that will make you more attractive.
[time=2940] There's every type of thing to enhance your body.
[time=2943] You know God's not primarily concerned about our bodies.
[time=2946] Matter of fact, he says these bodies are lowly.
[time=2949] King James uses the word vile. The word vile in 1611 did not mean what it means today.
[time=2955] It simply meant humble or lowly.
[time=2957] Today we think of something that is evil when we use the word vile.
[time=2961] He is not saying that our bodies are evil. He just says they're human.
[time=2965] They're lowly, and they're not at all the body with which we will inhabit heaven.
[time=2972] Now I remember a time in my life when I was involved in athletics and I was in great shape.
[time=2979] Last night I began to jog a little bit. I went out and I jogged and I really felt pretty good.
[time=2984] I calculated out by the way I felt and how long that I had run. I jogged between three and a half miles.
[time=2990] I really felt good about that. Just to double check this morning on the way in, I measured it.
[time=2995] It was about 1.1 miles.
[time=2999] It's a little bit of an age factor that creeps in.
[time=3003] There's another problem. It's called the pound per inch factor.
[time=3008] You know my body's changing and contrary to what the humanists say, it ain't getting better and better every day in every way.
[time=3016] I'm falling apart. I'm 29 years old. I can imagine what you 39-year-olds feel like.
[time=3022] Some mornings we wake up and we've got pains in places that we didn't know we ever had before.
[time=3032] These are human bodies and they're frail. They fall apart. They're susceptible to disease, to infection, to pain.
[time=3041] But God says there's a promise of a new body and there's a pattern that our body is going to be like his body,
[time=3049] the resurrected body of Jesus Christ. May I share with you that that body was physical and it was visible and identifiable?
[time=3057] His disciples recognized him. They saw him. Can I also share with you that it was a body that functioned?
[time=3064] That it could function? That he could speak? That he could hear? That he could talk?
[time=3068] For those of you who are Baptist, there's great news. Jesus ate in his resurrection body.
[time=3074] Proof positive that he himself was a Baptist.
[time=3078] I don't know that we're going to eat forever in heaven.
[time=3081] But I do know that our bodies can function and we can serve him and there is purpose to our life today and there'll be purpose to heaven.
[time=3088] We will not simply sit idly, but we'll serve him forever. Do you want to know the greatest thing about heaven?
[time=3094] As all of us are going to have a voice like birds and not like mine.
[time=3098] And I'm going to sing in heaven and the best thing about it is you're going to like it.
[time=3102] That's the pattern. We're going to have a body just like Jesus Christ and there's power.
[time=3107] How's God going to do it? He's going to do it by the power of God.
[time=3110] He said by the same power that he subdues all things, power of God.
[time=3116] Someone said, "Well, how is God going to raise our bodies?" Even the Bible says they returned to dust. One scientist said, "God's got this giant computer bank.
[time=3123] He's got all the DNA chromosomal structure and he just outputs a new one of us." Someone else says, "No, he picks up one of those specs of dust and he re-clones us." Can I tell you how he's going to do it? He's going to do it the same way he did it the first time.
[time=3136] He said, "Let there be and there was something that came out of nothing." And we came into existence and God's going to say, "Rise again and with a shout he's going to raise our bodies.
[time=3146] He's going to change us into a glorious body by his power." Well, we've seen today the promise. We've seen today the pattern and the power.
[time=3159] The most important thing is the principle. The principle is this.
[time=3163] This place is not our home. We're so journers. We're citizens set up to colonize the influence.
[time=3170] But the principle is that we do not live for this life and we do not live for this body.
[time=3175] Yes, there are those whose God is their belly. We are unique and the principle says that we live as citizens of a different country
[time=3183] and I need not be overly concerned with this body because I have a new body waiting for me.
[time=3191] Perspective or the difference that it makes an expectation.
[time=3196] Towards the end of the last century, two very prominent men in this country died near the same time.
[time=3203] One was Colonel Ingersoll, an intellectual giant in every right.
[time=3208] A capable communicator or respected man. A man committed in his intelligence and in his lectures to saying that there is no God.
[time=3218] The world came by chance. He loved to argue and debate that there is no God. There is no afterlife.
[time=3225] Colonel Ingersoll died. It was a point of despair and gloom and agony. Not only for him, but for his whole family.
[time=3235] It was a dark day of despair. And about that same time another man died.
[time=3241] And as he was approaching death and as he lay on his bed still conscious, his family came in and they began to pray that God would get strength to his body
[time=3249] and God would raise him up. And in the gentle way, the man said, "Oh no, don't pray for that. I'm going home.
[time=3256] And I'm anxious to see the Lord. Don't pray for that." How could one man go with confidence in another man with despair?
[time=3267] It's because the one man, the white almighty, knew Jesus Christ.
[time=3272] And he had within the perspective of death and expectation that Jesus Christ would say to him,
[time=3279] "Well done now, good and faithful servant. Enter into the reward for you." He would receive new body, a new hope.
[time=3288] Citizens of Heaven.
[time=3291] I was born into this country and by my physical birth I became a citizen of this great land.
[time=3298] It's not by physical birth that one becomes a citizen of Heaven. It's by a new birth.
[time=3304] Jesus said, "If you would enter into the kingdom of Heaven that you must be born again.
[time=3311] You must be born as a citizen of Heaven." The Bible says we do that.
[time=3316] When we by faith surrender our life to him and receive Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.
[time=3323] It is then that we not only become citizens of Heaven where we receive that identification, but it is then that we begin to have the heartbeat of anticipation, of looking for His coming,
[time=3334] a heartbeat of expectation, of what He's going to do when it comes and how I'll change our body.
[time=3342] What is your perspective today?
[time=3344] Do you mind earthly things? Do you live for this life?
[time=3348] Or are you a citizen of Heaven?
[time=3353] Let us pray together.
[time=3356] This morning as we've spoken, we've spoken about an identification that can only come
[time=3363] if you by faith invite Jesus Christ into your heart.
[time=3368] If you will surrender to Him, simply pray to receive Him as your Savior and not be ashamed of Him.
[time=3376] But you'll name the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3379] It's my prayer that you'll make that decision this very moment.
[time=3406] You have been listening to the Bible hour and sharing the Word of God with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3411] If as a result of Pastor Rick's message today you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,
[time=3418] we would invite you to pray this prayer with us right now.
[time=3422] Precious Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and that He died for our sins.
[time=3429] I realize that I am a sinner and at this moment I receive Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=3437] I transfer my faith from what I have been believing to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation.
[time=3446] I thank you that you have saved me in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3453] The words to that little prayer never saved anyone, but if in your heart you have really trusted Jesus Christ
[time=3460] and are depending upon Him alone for full salvation, the Bible says thou, shall be saved.
[time=3467] If you've made that decision, we'd like to send you this little booklet.
[time=3470] It's entitled Your Decision.
[time=3472] It'll be very, very helpful for the decision that you made this morning.
[time=3477] Earlier in our program today, we spoke of a book called Your Ministry of Encouragement.
