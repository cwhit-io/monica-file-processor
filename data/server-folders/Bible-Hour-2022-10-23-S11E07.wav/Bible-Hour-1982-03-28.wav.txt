[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=94] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=101] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=113] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=118] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=129] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=139] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=147] We welcome you this morning to our worship service.
[time=152] It was good to hear you sing those songs of praise.
[time=155] I'm delighted to see you here this morning and want to extend that same welcome to our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=163] It's truly a delight as a body of believers to study the Word of God together, to be able to share it within our own lives, to share it in the community through the ministry of television, but to study it ourselves and to have our lives built upon the Word of God is truly the strength of life today.
[time=180] So the choir sings of the power and the beauty of the Word of God, a song this morning entitled "The Bible Stands." Our sanctuary choir extolling for us the virtue of the Word of God.
[time=206] [MUSIC] The Bible stands like a rock and a tin [MUSIC] In the raging storms of time [MUSIC] His pages burn with a truth eternal [MUSIC] Let they glow with the lights of light [MUSIC] The Bible stands so that His may tumble [MUSIC] It will firmly stand when the earth shall come all [MUSIC] I will plant my feet on its first foundation [MUSIC] For the Bible stands [MUSIC] The Bible stands and it will forever [MUSIC] When the world has passed away [MUSIC] Just by His salvation it has been given [MUSIC] All is free since I will obey [MUSIC] The Bible stands [MUSIC] And when you stand when the earth shall come all [MUSIC] My voiceings are a spare foundation [MUSIC] For the Bible stands [MUSIC] The Bible stands [MUSIC]
[time=303] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=355] Now let's take our hymnals and turn them to him number 425.
[time=362] We're going to sing "My Faith Looks Up To Thee." Him number 425.
[time=368] And those of you who are listening at home, you join right ahead and sing along as we sing this great song.
[time=374] Everyone's standing together now as we sing.
[time=379] [MUSIC - 67 seconds]
[time=453] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=457] A beautiful story in the Word of God tells about a little boy who gave what he had to the Lord.
[time=463] And the Lord took it, blessed it, broke it, and multiplied it.
[time=469] In children's language, you might say, "What a bunch of lunch!" And that's what the boys and girls are going to sing for us right now.
[time=479] [MUSIC - 182 seconds]
[time=664] (guitar strumming) - Hello and once again, thank you for joining us
[time=675] for the Bible Hour today.
[time=677] We're midway through our service at this time, and Don and I have these few moments just to share a little bit with you personally who join us each week for television.
[time=686] Don, these are busy days for you with the Eastern Music Cal coming up.
[time=690] - Well, they sure are our pastor Rick, but they're exciting times because we're getting ready for the presentation of the Fourth Cross.
[time=697] It's a cantata that's written by Derek Johnson, and we're going to be holding it here in our Convocation Center.
[time=702] And there are lots of disadvantages to a building like ours, but there are advantages in that we're going to be able to stage what we're doing.
[time=710] On this stage with a scrim, we're going to be showing all the pictures of the last scenes of our Lord's life.
[time=717] The Lord's Supper, Gethsemane, Jesus in Pilots Hall, and we're all going to do it behind the scenes, and the choir will be standing along the front of the stage here.
[time=729] And it's a story that might have been.
[time=731] It's the story of Barabbas.
[time=733] It tells all the biblical facts, but then it suggests that Barabbas could have possibly come to trust Christ as a Savior.
[time=741] It's an exciting cantata and an exciting musical, and we're just looking forward to presenting it.
[time=747] - Well, for us here in Fort Wayne, that's two weeks from today, but for the people who are watching in South Bend and Chicago, the day you're seeing this particular church service from Black Hawk Baptist Church, it is Easter Sunday.
[time=762] And so we want to wish you a happy Easter to you, even though it's not Easter here.
[time=766] For those of you who are in Fort Wayne, there are still two weeks between now and the Easter music cow, which will be performed on Good Friday, Saturday, and Easter Sunday evenings.
[time=777] And if you would like tickets, we'd love to have you right to us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church or to call the church office.
[time=784] Obviously, it's too late for our friends in Chicago and South Bend, but for you people in Fort Wayne, we'd love to have you join us for this year's Easter music cow.
[time=793] Don, I'm looking forward to my part in that, and each time we have a special musical, it's a special opportunity for us to share through music the life-changing power of Jesus Christ.
[time=804] But the power comes through His Word.
[time=806] The Bible says that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.
[time=810] And you have a booklet to share with our people of how they can know God's Word.
[time=814] Pastor Rick, this is a tremendous little book that we have offered on other occasions here in our church.
[time=819] It's called Timeless Insights.
[time=821] Many of you have written in Fort and have gotten it and you use it as a devotional guide, and that's exactly what it is.
[time=827] It's a devotional guide.
[time=828] There's Bible scripture reading for every single day.
[time=831] Then there are some timeless insights.
[time=834] In other words, some suggestions by different men like C.S. Lewis and Johnathan Edwards concerning those particular scripture verses.
[time=844] And then there's always a timely response.
[time=846] How does this scripture affect your life and your walk with Jesus Christ?
[time=851] We'd love to send this to you.
[time=853] Maybe you have not received it yet.
[time=855] And we'd like to send it to you.
[time=856] Please write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=865] And then we'll send you this copy of Timeless Insights.
[time=868] It will be a great help to your devotions and your walk with God.
[time=873] I hope that many of you write in for this particular booklet to learn to study the Bible faithfully and regularly each day.
[time=880] We'd like to send it to you.
[time=882] We are going to share today that we wouldn't be with you.
[time=885] We know we can Fort Wayne, but we will be with you.
[time=888] Because of the flood that has hit our city in recent weeks, WPTA, who airs the Bible Hour here in Fort Wayne, has chosen not to have the Easter sale telethon, sensing the needs of our community to be so great, they thought it would be best not to air that.
[time=905] And so they'll be bringing you the Bible Hour next week.
[time=908] We're thankful for WPTA's sensitivity towards the community and the good friends they have been to the Bible Hour for many years.
[time=915] And we'll look forward to being back with you next week for the Bible Hour.
[time=919] Don?
[time=920] Pastor Rick, in just a few minutes, the Strictly Feminine Group is going to be singing, and then I'll be sharing a special number with the congregation.
[time=928] I wondered what you were going to be sharing with us.
[time=930] Well, we've been studying through the Book of Philippians throughout these winter months.
[time=935] However, last week it was friend Sunday, so we took time for a very special evangelistic message.
[time=940] And the week before that, it was a missions conference, so we had a missions message.
[time=944] But if you can remember back to three weeks ago today, we talked about the fact that our believers' hope is in the fact that Jesus Christ is coming again.
[time=954] Now, if we really believe that, it's going to affect our life.
[time=958] And so today, Paul tells us from Philippians 4 how the believer should walk because Jesus Christ is coming soon.
[time=965] I'm looking forward to sharing that with you.
[time=968] Once again, thank you for joining us.
[time=970] And if you would like a copy of our Daily Bible Study booklet entitled "Timly Insights," we want you to write to us today at the Bible Hour, write to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=986] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=998] [SILENCE]
[time=1008] [MUSIC]
[time=1023] Go ahead, write the nails in my hands, laugh at me where you stand.
[time=1036] [MUSIC]
[time=1056] There's no power on earth until I be down.
[time=1069] Death can't keep me in the ground.
[time=1075] Go ahead, and walk my game.
[time=1082] I love for you, is still the same.
[time=1088] Go ahead, and bury me.
[time=1095] But very soon, I will be free,
[time=1102] 'cause I'll rise again.
[time=1109] There's no power on earth until I be down.
[time=1115] Death can't keep me in the ground.
[time=1128] Go ahead, and say I'm dead and gone.
[time=1136] But you will see that you were wrong.
[time=1142] Go ahead, and try to hide the sun.
[time=1150] But I will say that I'm the one.
[time=1156] 'Cause I'll call again.
[time=1163] There's no power on earth can't keep me back.
[time=1169] Yes, I'll call again.
[time=1177] Come to take my people home.
[time=1183] [MUSIC]
[time=1203] Thank you, ladies, for reminding us of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1207] That He claimed to be the son of God, and He substantially backed that claim up with His bodily resurrection from the grave.
[time=1215] Not only did He rise from the grave, but He's coming back again for you and I.
[time=1220] We're thankful for the many people who share in the ministry of our church with their talents.
[time=1224] These ladies with their singing for a group of men in our church with their hands.
[time=1228] Gary Bowman designed this modesty panel, and the man by the name of Mike Ventrilla built it for us.
[time=1234] It helps us to convert our convocation center looking more like a sanctuary than a gymnasium.
[time=1240] So this morning, as you come to worship, don't look at the baskets, look at this beautiful piece of furniture.
[time=1245] We're thankful for the men that built that.
[time=1247] We really have almost no cost in that.
[time=1250] But really, worship is not a matter of whether our baskets are on the ceiling or crosses on the front.
[time=1256] It's a matter of the heart.
[time=1257] And so Don Krueger comes at this time to sing for us, to turn our attention to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1264] that we might worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[time=1267] Don?
[time=1281] You may ask me how I know, my Lord is real.
[time=1292] You may doubt the things I say, or doubt the way that I feel.
[time=1304] But I know He's real to me, He'll always be.
[time=1315] I can sense His hand in mine, and that's enough for me.
[time=1327] I will never walk alone, He holds my hand.
[time=1338] He will guide each step I take, and if I fall, He's there to understand.
[time=1350] Till the day He tells me why, He loves me so.
[time=1361] I can sense His hand in mine, and that's all I need to know.
[time=1380] Many friends that I have known, past me part, never stopped to see the teardrops in my eyes.
[time=1408] They may never, never know the pain I bear.
[time=1420] But my Lord is near to me, every sorrow shares.
[time=1431] I may never walk alone, He holds my hand.
[time=1443] He will guide each step I take, and if I fall, I know He'll understand.
[time=1455] Till the day He tells me why, He loves me so.
[time=1466] I can sense His hand in mine, that's all I need to know.
[time=1496] Thank you, Don.
[time=1497] We appreciate the ministry of music that takes our heart, our mind, and focuses in on the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1505] And I like that song that we began with this morning from our choir that told us about the Bible, that it stands and that we can trust it.
[time=1513] We're a Bible teaching, a Bible-believing church.
[time=1516] We believe that God so loved the world that He gave His Son, that whosoard believed in Him would not perish, but have everlasting life.
[time=1525] And if God was going to give us His Son that we might have life, then He would also give us a record of His Son that we might know Him.
[time=1532] And the Bible says these things are written unto ye that you may know that you have eternal life that you might believe on the name of the Son of God.
[time=1541] So without apology this morning, we study God's Word.
[time=1544] We believe it as a reference point for our life, a guide, a direction on how we should live.
[time=1550] I invite you to open your Bible with me this morning that we might study it together.
[time=1555] We've been going through the Book of Philippians during the fall, winter, and now into these spring months.
[time=1561] We've had a two-week leave of absence from Philippians.
[time=1564] Last week was friend day, and we had a special message for that day.
[time=1568] The week before was a missions conference, and we had a special message for that day.
[time=1572] But this morning, we're back in the Book of Philippians, and we're ready for chapter 4 verses 1 through 4.
[time=1580] But before we do that, we need to remind ourselves of the third chapter.
[time=1584] So I invite you to open your Bibles that I can read for you this morning, and you can follow along in yours silently.
[time=1590] And I'll read Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 through chapter 4 verse 4.
[time=1597] For our conversation or citizenship is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1608] Who shall change our vile or humble body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[time=1623] Therefore, my beloved, dearly brethren, and long for my joy and crowns, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
[time=1632] I beseech Uodius, and I beseech Sintake that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
[time=1638] And I entreat thee also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with many other my fellow labors whose names are in the Book of Philippians.
[time=1652] Names are in the Book of Life. Rejoice in the Lord, always, and again I say, rejoice.
[time=1659] Now the reason why I went back to read those two verses out of chapter 3 is that there is a logical connection between those two verses and what we saw this morning in chapter 4.
[time=1671] As a matter of fact, when God inspired his word through his spirit into the mind of Paul, he did that without reference to chapter and verses.
[time=1681] Those come centuries later simply to supply an index.
[time=1685] That would be great should you and I be able to come together this morning.
[time=1689] I could say, well, let's all turn to that part of the Bible where Paul talks about in Philippians being citizens, and we all just flipped right to the spot because we knew our Bible so well.
[time=1698] Unfortunately, we don't study as well as we should, and many of us could not do that, and so men have supplied chapter and references that we could turn and quickly identify.
[time=1709] Now the reason why I say that this morning is so you'll know that in the mind of God, and in the mind of Paul when he wrote this, that chapter 4 and chapter 3 go together, it's not a breaking point in terms of the flow of the passage.
[time=1725] Chapter 3 ends with three statements about perspective, the perspective of identification that I am a citizen of heaven, therefore that's going to change my behavior, my outlook on life.
[time=1738] That I have changed my perspective of identification.
[time=1742] There's also the change of the perspective of expectation.
[time=1746] What do I expect to happen?
[time=1748] What is my concept, my hope of the future?
[time=1751] My expectation has a different perspective than this world because I am expecting Jesus Christ to come again.
[time=1758] That changes how I live.
[time=1760] If you believe Jesus Christ is going to come before next Sunday morning, I am sure that your life would be different this week than it was last week.
[time=1769] If today I could say with certainty, he will be here next Sunday morning.
[time=1773] It changes our perspective.
[time=1775] Also, there's the perspective of anticipation. While society says live for the gratification of appetite, God says that we are to live not for this body but for the eternal body that he's going to give us when he remakes us.
[time=1789] There's the perspective of anticipation.
[time=1793] Now, what Paul was saying is if we believe we are citizens of heaven, if we believe he is coming back, then it is going to dictate how we live.
[time=1801] So chapter 4 begins with the little word, therefore.
[time=1805] Therefore is a connecting word.
[time=1807] It's saying here is a statement, you're a citizen of heaven, Christ is coming again.
[time=1812] Therefore, here's how you ought to live in light of those two perspectives.
[time=1817] And so we begin with chapter 4, lessons on living.
[time=1822] Now, if we read these first four verses, you should find a little pattern, a repetition that will give you a clue as to what the writer is saying.
[time=1830] The words repeated are these in the Lord.
[time=1834] Verse 1, stand fast in the Lord.
[time=1838] Verse 2, be of the same mind in the Lord.
[time=1842] Verse 4, rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1846] And so that formulates our outline for study this morning.
[time=1850] Stand fast in the Lord, be united in the Lord, and rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1855] First Paul says, knowing that he's a citizen of heaven, and knowing that Christ is coming again, that he is ready to stand fast in the Lord.
[time=1865] Now any of you who are parents and have taken long trips with your children, know the famous words that will come up early on that trip.
[time=1873] I see you whispering back and forth, you already know what those words are.
[time=1877] Are we there yet?
[time=1879] How much longer will it be?
[time=1882] I remember as the youth pastor of this church taking four trips to Florida, full of teenagers.
[time=1887] We go down I-69 and we head down I-75 all the way to Florida, 24 hour drive.
[time=1893] Somewhere between Huntington and Indianapolis, they say, are we almost there yet?
[time=1899] And I learned after four years, no matter where we are on the trip, I say, well it's probably going to be more than a half hour.
[time=1905] Now those are little words that you get tired of as parents.
[time=1908] Are we there yet?
[time=1909] You know what those little words represent?
[time=1912] They represent a desire to have it over with, to be done.
[time=1917] In life, God has called us to serve him, and he's called us to fight a battle and to stand in that battle.
[time=1925] And our profile is usually, Lord, is it over yet?
[time=1928] Are we almost there?
[time=1930] How much longer do I have to stand?
[time=1933] You know, one of the joys of the Word of God is that it tells us that God will call us to stand, but he gives us that calling the hope that we stand in the Lord.
[time=1942] Let's just take a moment and look at the phrase stand in the Lord.
[time=1947] It's primarily a military term.
[time=1949] It refers to a soldier who is standing in battle and it would be the cry of the commander that as the enemy is coming right up for hand-to-hand combat,
[time=1958] even though the odds may be overwhelming when the commander would say, "Stand and hold your ground."
[time=1965] There would be no bugle blowing retreat but to stand.
[time=1970] No, Paul was one who could write and tell people to stand because he was stood some of the great trials and battles of life.
[time=1978] Even from once he wrote, he was standing under a great trial.
[time=1982] He was a prisoner of Rome, being held prisoner with the sentence of death, a possibility in front of him.
[time=1989] Not only did he have that particular trial he was facing, he was facing the trial of constant antagonism.
[time=1996] Every time he went from a city to a city to a city, there were a group of malicious, vile men who sought to take his life.
[time=2003] And even one time came near to that at the city of Listera when they stoned him and gave him up for dead.
[time=2009] He had faced adversity.
[time=2011] But not only were there the physical adversaries, there were the spiritual ones.
[time=2015] That as he went from city and he would establish a church into another city to establish another church, there would be a group of people who would follow him and they would pervert the teaching of the Word of God.
[time=2025] They were Judaizers, they were dogs according to this book.
[time=2028] They were legalizers, those that added to the Word of God.
[time=2032] Not only was there that problem, but there was the problem within the churches.
[time=2036] There was tension, there was strife, and Paul could have been a discouraged, despondent man.
[time=2042] He was one who stood fast, and he stood in the Lord.
[time=2047] You know, it's important for us to understand that, for where we are as a church and as a body of people.
[time=2053] For many years we have stood for the Lord.
[time=2056] But we've stood in days when we were standing and moving forward, going with the flow.
[time=2061] We're no longer going with the flow men and women we are going against the flow.
[time=2066] For the first ten years of our church's history, we were strategically located.
[time=2070] We began here with two trailers stuck together here on the hinterland of the wilderness.
[time=2075] There wasn't anything around here.
[time=2077] When you thought of Blackhawk Baptist Church, you thought of this little mission station out there towards the reservations.
[time=2083] We were really on the outskirts of town.
[time=2086] During the first twelve years of our church's history, the town grew out to meet us.
[time=2090] Literally thousands and thousands of people moved in and became our neighbors.
[time=2094] And there was great population growth, and we went with that growth in a flow.
[time=2099] There were also days of economic prosperity.
[time=2102] 1977, 1978, 1979, there was a boom in the local economy.
[time=2108] Houses were being built right now.
[time=2110] A contractor is an endangered species.
[time=2113] There were those that had economic successes.
[time=2116] Now we live in a time when our nation is facing, perhaps, the greatest depression that is faced since the great depression of the days of FDR.
[time=2125] And so we struggle.
[time=2127] We're no longer a church that's going downstream with the flow of life.
[time=2131] We're a church that's trying to go upstream against the flow of life.
[time=2134] We're trying to fight population changes.
[time=2136] We're trying to fight economic reverses.
[time=2139] We're trying to fight inflation.
[time=2141] We're trying to fight unemployment.
[time=2143] And so we are a church that must now stand in adversity.
[time=2147] You know, the test of a church is not how does it go downstream?
[time=2151] But how well do you go upstream?
[time=2153] How well do you stand when the current of life pours in against you?
[time=2158] How well do we stand as a body of people?
[time=2160] How well do we stand as individuals when we're misunderstood?
[time=2164] Oh, it's great to exhibit character and conduct befitting a believer of Jesus Christ.
[time=2170] Everyone pats us on the back and tells us how wonderful we are.
[time=2174] What do we do when someone criticizes and someone complains?
[time=2179] What do we do when someone actually verbally assassinates our character and they attack us?
[time=2184] Then do we stand?
[time=2186] Paul was one who could say, "Stand fast in the Lord," and he was standing against the flow of life.
[time=2193] We're told that we are to stand for truth, for doctrine, that we are to stand for it and not be ashamed of it.
[time=2202] We're told that we're to stand for morality and ethical ideals and practices they live by.
[time=2208] We're told to stand.
[time=2210] You know, we're hardly ever told in the Word of God to advance.
[time=2213] We're usually told to stand.
[time=2215] Ephesians the sixth chapter is a great chapter about the warfare of the believer and it describes the armor.
[time=2221] And throughout that chapter it tells us to stand repeatedly.
[time=2224] Four or five times it says, "Stand," doesn't say advance.
[time=2228] Then if you take an analysis of the armor of God, you will discover that almost every piece of that armor is defensive.
[time=2236] A helmet, the defend from blows to the head.
[time=2239] A breastplate, the defend from the piercing arrows.
[time=2242] A shield, the ward off the blows of the enemy sword.
[time=2245] Shinpats, everything is defensive with one exception, the sword.
[time=2250] And the sword of the Christian is the word of God.
[time=2253] You see, God is the one through his word and his spirit who advances the cause.
[time=2258] And as he gains the ground, we're to stand and to maintain it.
[time=2262] Not only is it church, but as individuals, we're to stand fast in the Lord.
[time=2267] But you know, there's an inherent danger to standing fast in the Lord.
[time=2271] The danger is that we'll take a strong military stand for the truth of the word of God.
[time=2277] We'll take a strong military stand for the doctrine that says that he is coming again.
[time=2283] We'll take a strong stand, shield up sword in hand to say that moral purity is a standard of God and it is not to be lowered, regardless of what men will say.
[time=2294] But the inherent danger is that we'll take that same stand on something that we personally believe that God never said in his word.
[time=2303] And that's why we come to verse 2.
[time=2305] I beseech, Uodius and Centaiki, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
[time=2311] Historically, what had taken place is here were two women, each having a different opinion.
[time=2319] And their opinion caused them to stand, and as they stand they began to fight each other,
[time=2325] and it was such a severe matter it came to the attention of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2329] Now we need to understand something historically.
[time=2332] These two ladies have names, Uodius, which means prosperous journey.
[time=2338] And Centaiki means pleasant acquaintance.
[time=2343] I would like to suggest to you this morning that if you walked into the parlor of the Church of Philippi, and you bumped into Uodius and Centaiki, that it would not be a pleasant acquaintance, and your journey would not be prosperous, these women had reached a point of quarreling that was very significant.
[time=2360] Before we understand what they were quarreling about, let's make a few deductions, since the word does not say what they were arguing about.
[time=2368] First deduction that we can make is that this is a very serious matter.
[time=2372] Philippi is located in Greece, Rome as the crow flies 600 miles away.
[time=2380] It is a long journey, and it must have been a significant problem for that problem, have gone to Paul and for him to write back.
[time=2388] It's very uncommon of Paul to mention names of people in his epistles in a derogatory or negative way.
[time=2395] This had to be a serious problem.
[time=2397] The second thing we can deduce, however, is this is not a moral problem.
[time=2401] It wasn't a matter of morality or ethics, because whenever God deals with a problem with morality,
[time=2407] he's specific. Paul in particular, when he wrote to Corinth and there was a dispute over morality, he said who was the one that was at fault, and he said here's what the standard of the word of God is, and he told him to throw such a one out of the Church.
[time=2421] Now if this was a moral problem, Paul would have said here's what's right, here's what's wrong, who's right and who's wrong and straightening out now.
[time=2428] It wasn't a moral problem.
[time=2431] Also, it is not a doctrinal problem.
[time=2434] If one of them was teaching false doctrine and the other one was teaching the correct doctrine, Paul would have wrote and said here is the correct doctrine, here's who's right and here's who's wrong.
[time=2444] He did that, he wrote to Timothy, and he said beware of Hymenias and Alexander the Coppersmith,
[time=2450] because they have made shipwreck the faith teaching false doctrine.
[time=2455] So we can deduce that this is a big problem, but it's not a moral problem, it's not a doctrinal problem.
[time=2461] Then what type of problem is it?
[time=2463] It's a problem of personal perspective.
[time=2466] It's a matter of two different people, with two different backgrounds, with two different interests, approaching life from their single perspective.
[time=2475] The problem is one of personal perspective.
[time=2478] Now, in my investigating of historical commentaries and the like, I have been suggested to that there may have been several problems.
[time=2487] One person has suggested that the major disturbance was that Euodius had a regular seat in the church, right over there.
[time=2497] She sat there every Sunday, and she was comfortable in there, but one of the cameramen had the audacity to every week
[time=2504] to wheel that camera right in front of her and to destroy her sense of worship.
[time=2510] Now that was greeted by St. Tyke, who remembered that it was through television that she accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=2517] And she was ready to identify this person and this person and this person who had grown spiritually because of television, and they were at battle.
[time=2526] Now I doubt that that was it, but that has been suggested by some local commentators.
[time=2531] More than likely, the case was over an individual who got a copy of the 1982 budget
[time=2537] and they discovered how much money was being spent in missions and they didn't feel like that was enough money being spent in missions.
[time=2543] They felt like our missionaries deserved more.
[time=2546] But this person over here said, "How on earth are we spending more money on missions when we are unable to pay for everything we've already spent?"
[time=2555] And Uodius was really upset because many of the people who were going to the mission field were personal friends of hers.
[time=2563] And St. Tyke said, "Well, yeah, some of the people who do our printing are personal friends of mine.
[time=2567] I think we ought to pay them for..." And why were they mad?
[time=2570] And Paul, he had to get the invoices out and sort through which ones should be paid first.
[time=2575] Actually, the problem was this, that in the city of Philippi, there was coming a nationally known personality
[time=2582] who was very eloquent and well versed on the needs of the family.
[time=2586] And he was coming to the city of Philippi and there was a great deal of frustration because the local Colosseum, where they held the games of Philippi, was not quite adequate to hold all the people that wanted to come.
[time=2599] And Uodius felt bad that St. Tyke didn't get tickets, but she was going to keep hers and she was going to go.
[time=2607] She wasn't going to miss that.
[time=2609] St. Tyke was really upset.
[time=2612] First of all, she felt that she should have the tickets because she had more children.
[time=2618] Secondly, she thought the church was wrong for not having the prayer meeting because every Wednesday we always have a prayer meeting
[time=2624] and this church stands for prayer in the Word of God and we're not going to cancel our services to go down there.
[time=2630] You begin to see what was happening in the church of Philippi. Does it sound familiar?
[time=2636] You know, all those things are not moral issues.
[time=2639] It's not a matter of morality, how much money we spend in the Christian school versus how much money we spend on a bulletin.
[time=2647] It's not a moral matter. It's not an ethical matter this morning.
[time=2652] Whether we go to hear Dr. Jim Dobson speak on a Wednesday night or whether we go down to our chapel and hear me speak.
[time=2657] I know you'd rather hear me, but just for once, go hear Dr. Dobson.
[time=2661] I'm going to go hear Dr. Dobson. You do what you want to do.
[time=2665] You see the point, men and women?
[time=2668] Whenever we get a personal perspective, we begin to stand and fight.
[time=2673] And men and women, we can stand here today with confidence and say, "Thus saith the Lord Jesus Christ is coming again."
[time=2681] You know, with that same fervor, I cannot say, "Thus saith the Lord, thou shall have three television cameras."
[time=2691] You know, God didn't say that. I believe it. He didn't say that.
[time=2695] You know, there's a danger that when we stand, that we stand and we fight and we stop fighting when we discover that the enemy is gone.
[time=2705] Let me quote to you something that Truman Dollar said in the Baptist bulletin two years ago.
[time=2710] One could almost regret that the liberals have lost their influence.
[time=2716] Since it's hardly worth it to fight them because they have no power, we fight each other.
[time=2723] There is something inherently a part of a fundamentalist that compels him to do battle all the time.
[time=2730] If he can't fight an enemy, he'll fight a friend.
[time=2734] And this generation, one needs the armor of Ephesians 6 to guard himself from the attacks of other fundamentalist.
[time=2742] It's so important that we stand for the Word of God that men and women, it's just as important that we stand united in the Lord.
[time=2750] I'd like to share with you some major barriers to unity within a body of people.
[time=2755] The first is thinking that unity means uniformity.
[time=2761] You know, I know what Uodius attitude was.
[time=2764] She said, "That's right, Paul. You tell him where to be united." And as soon as she finds out she's wrong and I'm right and converts over to my opinion, then we'll be united in the Lord.
[time=2775] There's always pressure that we're to have solidarity.
[time=2779] And that everyone is to think the same way, to have the same perspective, to have the same values, to have the same priorities.
[time=2785] And if everyone just thought like me, just think what a wonderful place our church would be.
[time=2790] And I suggest to you that God does not want uniformity, but what the Spirit of God actually wants is united diversity, united diversity.
[time=2800] He tried to explain that to the Church of Corinth.
[time=2804] He said, "I've made you all one body." But he said, "Are all of you feet? Are all of your hands? Are all of your mouths usually? Are all of you ears? Not very often."
[time=2814] You know what he was saying with the illustration of the body? He was saying that he gave us all a different function, and he gave us different personality and different perspective.
[time=2824] That I, with my perspective, might give direction to you.
[time=2827] And you, with your perspective, can help me to see a broader picture.
[time=2831] And that diversity is born of the Spirit of God.
[time=2834] But that within diversity of personality and diversity of perspective, there can be unity of heart.
[time=2840] And the constant tension is for someone to always want to stamp down a rule, stamp down a dogma, and force everybody into uniformity.
[time=2849] Wouldn't it be wonderful if we all looked alike, if we all talked alike, if we all acted alike?
[time=2855] You know what? We'd just do battle over who was going to become the pattern.
[time=2858] But God wants us to do is to love and accept people with a different perspective and to cooperate and to work together.
[time=2866] Well, the first barrier to unity in the Church is the desire for uniformity, that it's fine if we get united, as long as we do it all the same way, and everyone looks just like me.
[time=2876] But here's a second barrier.
[time=2878] It is the barrier that people are so emotionally attached to their perspective that they want to take an "aw" moral issue, something that is not moral and turn it into a moral issue.
[time=2890] And therefore those that campaign, when they come to an "aw" moral issue, they come up with sub-reason A, B, C, D, E, and F.
[time=2898] Why they're right, and anyone that had any brains would see that they're right.
[time=2901] And after all, it's violating conscience and they're just standing on the Word of God.
[time=2905] Men and women, don't try to make your personal perspective of God.
[time=2911] You can have your perspective, you're free in Jesus Christ.
[time=2915] It's just important that you give everyone else that same freedom in the Lord.
[time=2919] But here's the greatest barrier to unity in the Church, and that is that we don't understand ourselves.
[time=2925] Each of us feel like, "I'm just a gracious, God-honoring, lover of the Word and Truth, who is just trying to humbly stand for the Word of God."
[time=2936] May I share with you that there is no such critter?
[time=2939] A survey was done of 800,000 high school students.
[time=2944] Let me give you the results of that survey.
[time=2947] They asked those students, "Do you view yourself as above average or below average in your leadership personality?"
[time=2955] You know, 70% of those kids thought that they were above average and only 2% thought they were below average.
[time=2963] Then they asked the question, and this is the fascinating one, "Do you view yourself as easy to get along with and likable and gregarious, and the people don't have any trouble with you?"
[time=2975] Out of the 800,000 people surveyed, 25% of the people who responded thought that they were in the top 1%.
[time=2987] "I'm just a wonderful guy. Everybody gets along with me." 60% of the people thought that they were in the top 25% and their ability to get along with people, and no one thought that they were below average.
[time=3002] Then I wondered, "Why would that happen?" It's because we really don't understand ourselves.
[time=3009] We don't understand that there are things about Rick Hawks that are abrasive, that are arrogant and offensive.
[time=3015] And I just think I'm this wonderful guy, and you know, if you don't think I'm as wonderful as I think I'm wonderful, it's obviously a spiritual deficiency in your life, and I'd be glad to pray for you this morning.
[time=3027] You know, that's how many of you feel, too.
[time=3030] I've got the right perspective. I'm going about it in the right way, and I'm so gracious and wonderful.
[time=3035] If the Lord was really ringing in their heart, they'd see it my way.
[time=3039] We don't understand ourselves. All of us have some rough edges.
[time=3043] And yes, the question, "Okay, now we know the problem. How is it that we're to be united?" Let me ask you to turn to another verse in the Bible.
[time=3051] Each of us, two Ephesians, the fourth chapter.
[time=3054] We don't often do this in the morning service. We don't hardly ever do this in the middle of a message.
[time=3060] I'm going to ask us to read aloud together, three verses in the Bible.
[time=3064] If you have a King James Bible, that's the text I'll be reading, and I invite you to read out loud with me.
[time=3069] If you have another translation, that's great. You'll probably just want to listen, then, so you won't be confused.
[time=3075] Ephesians, the fourth chapter, read with me, verses one through three.
[time=3080] "I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech ye that in walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith ye are called,
[time=3090] with all loneliness and meekness, with long suffering, for bearing one another in love,
[time=3097] endeavored to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
[time=3104] I asked you to read that this morning, but I'd really like to ask you to do more.
[time=3108] I'd like to ask you this morning to make this a verse for you to memorize today.
[time=3114] Did you go home today and with your family, open your word, the Bible, and memorize this verse?
[time=3121] We'll have a quiz when you come back to church tonight, and then if you're going to come back now, I said that.
[time=3125] But we're going to have a quiz to see how many memorize that.
[time=3128] And I know it's three verses, and it's tough, but you can do it.
[time=3131] But dust the cobwebs out and memorize it, I guarantee you that each of us needs to learn to live by this.
[time=3140] When I read that verse, God said something to my heart.
[time=3143] He said, "Basically hawks, that is not your emo, that is not your standard operating procedure."
[time=3150] How are we going to achieve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace this way, with all loneliness?
[time=3159] Loneliness refers to Philippians 2, where it said of the Lord Jesus Christ, that though He existed in the form of God, and He thought it not robbery to be equal with God, that He emptied Himself, and He humbled Himself, and He took upon Him in the form of a servant.
[time=3173] And it says, "Let this mind be in you," which was also in Christ's teachings.
[time=3177] All loneliness.
[time=3179] Secondly, meekness.
[time=3181] Meekness does not mean weakness or lack of strength, lack of ability to stand fast, but it means that my convictions and my personality are under control, and they exhibit themselves gently.
[time=3193] With all loneliness and meekness, with long suffering, that means we endure being wrong patiently.
[time=3200] It doesn't mean that we handle it one time, but it means we patiently, time after time, endure being wronged.
[time=3207] And it says with forbearance.
[time=3209] The little word forbearance, a legal word, that means that if you damage my personal, my property,
[time=3215] that I have the legal right to retaliate and to sue you, but the forbearance means I give up that right.
[time=3221] When someone wrongs us within the body of believers, that we give up our right to say, "I want to get you back, I want to get you back," with forbearance, with love, one for another.
[time=3234] Men and women, if we demonstrate these qualities, all loneliness, all meekness, forbearance, and love,
[time=3243] we will maintain unity amidst diversity.
[time=3248] It's welcome this morning that you have a different opinion.
[time=3251] You're invited this morning to disagree in matters of personal preference as long as you do it with the spirit of unity.
[time=3261] Well, Paul gives a method for dealing with people.
[time=3264] Paul was able to work with people to motivate them.
[time=3267] It's important that when we deal with problems that we do it in a positive way, look back at Philippians chapter 1
[time=3273] and you'll discover Paul's winsomeness with people.
[time=3278] Now, my normal personality would have been to write down, say, "All right, listen up, you birds.
[time=3284] You haven't got anything right. I'm only going to give it to you one more time." That's not how Paul addressed the people.
[time=3291] He begins, "Therefore, my brethren, my dearly beloved, my long for, my joy, and my crown."
[time=3300] See, as Paul addressed those people, he didn't address them as troublemakers or the enemy.
[time=3305] He addressed them as dearly beloved twice.
[time=3308] People who he loved, people who he considered the joy of his life, and he was winsome as he talked to them.
[time=3315] And then he said to them, "I beseech," which means "I encourage." And he repeated it twice, "I beseech Uodius. I beseech Sintake.
[time=3322] I beseech as a word of encouragement. It's a word of endearment.
[time=3326] It's the same word for encouragement or comfort that is the name of the Holy Spirit." And the gospel, according to John, when Jesus said, "I will send you the spirit of comfort."
[time=3336] Oh, Paul was trying to love them and encourage them in their perspective.
[time=3341] And then he said that they were fellow laborers with them.
[time=3345] He did not ignore their character and their conduct that was praiseworthy.
[time=3350] The most important thing is if we would endeavor to keep the unity of the body, that we would do it in a way that cares about people, even though they have a different opinion, that we view them as co-lavers, if we call them brethren, if we sense that there are dearly beloved,
[time=3364] if we appreciate them, and we come to encourage not to scorn.
[time=3369] We come to love and appreciate not to reject and to cast out.
[time=3373] And then he said that their ladies whose names are written in the Book of Life.
[time=3379] They were his sisters. They were his dearly beloved. They were as long for.
[time=3383] And God had taken their names and he had written it into the Book of Life because they had received Christ to Savior, and no matter how great the problem was, God would not let go of them. He would not reject them.
[time=3395] He would keep them, and the names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[time=3401] Stand fast in the Lord, stand united in the Lord.
[time=3406] Now that comes as a unique possibility because we are one body in Christ.
[time=3410] And if each of us is obedient to the head of Christ, there will be the love, the forbearance, the loneliness, and the meekness that the Word of God commands us to keep.
[time=3419] But the question is, are you a part of that body?
[time=3424] Let's pray together.
[time=3427] This morning when we speak of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, we only speak about those who have received Christ by faith and Savior.
[time=3437] You become a part of the body of Christ through the new birth.
[time=3441] And the stand for the Lord, the stand united, is only a reality for those who are part of His body,
[time=3447] who by faith have received it.
[time=3449] This morning, do you know Christ to Savior? If not, would you receive it right now by faith?
[time=3458] I pray that you will.
[time=3460] You have been listening to Pastor Rick Hawkes here in the Convocation Center at the Black Hawke Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3478] And if, as a result of today's message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,
[time=3485] we invite you to pray this prayer together with us right now.
[time=3488] Dear Father, I believe that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ died in my place and for my sins,
[time=3495] and I accept Him right now as my own personal Savior.
[time=3500] I transfer my faith in what I have been believing to Jesus Christ alone for salvation.
[time=3508] Thank you for saving me. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3514] Oh, I trust you prayed that prayer this morning and mean it with all of your heart.
[time=3518] And if you have, the Bible says, "Thou shalt be saved." We'd like to send a little booklet to help you. It's called Your Decision Magazine.
[time=3527] It will be a great inspiration to you, especially in this new decision that you have made for Jesus Christ.
