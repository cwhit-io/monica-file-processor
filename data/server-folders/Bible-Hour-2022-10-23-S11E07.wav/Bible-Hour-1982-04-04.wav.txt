[time=60] (beeping)
[time=90] For God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=99] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=105] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Cox and Don Prueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Island.
[time=116] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Our Musicians and our own Sanctuary Choir.
[time=124] Now here is Pastor Rick Hox from the Convocation Center
[time=130] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=133] - That's our delight to welcome you on this Palm Sunday morning here in Fort Wayne.
[time=140] It's more like a New Year's morning, but it is Palm Sunday.
[time=144] It's a day of the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ.
[time=147] Today where men did recognize who he was, the eternal Son of God, but that memory failed, and they rejected him just a few days later.
[time=157] He was put to the cross and he died for our sins, but because he died and rose again, we have hope this morning, we have hope of eternal life, and we have confidence that he lives in our heart.
[time=169] We're thankful today that you've come to worship with us.
[time=172] We're thankful that we can share this day with our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=177] It's our delight each week to faithfully proclaim the Word of God through music, through the spoken Word, through the praises of our hearts.
[time=185] The saying that the people cried out as Jesus entered the city was Hosanna, and so our choir now sings for us a song with that same name, Hosanna.
[time=196] (gentle music)
[time=205] (somber music) [MUSIC - 57 seconds]
[time=268] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=356] - Now let's sing a song of the season.
[time=368] I want you to turn in your hymnals to hymn number 165.
[time=372] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[time=375] Those of you who are listening at home, will you join us as we sing?
[time=378] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[time=381] Shall we all stand together now as we sing this great hymn?
[time=385] Together.
[time=388] [MUSIC - 86 seconds]
[time=477] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=485] We're very delighted to have with us this morning the master's touch.
[time=488] They're coming right now and singing a tremendous song for us.
[time=492] One that when I heard it, I got so excited, I decided this is going to be the first song for our this year's holiday presentation of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=502] It's entitled, "Very Appropriately, The Greatest Gift." Master's Touch.
[time=508] (upbeat music)
[time=517] [MUSIC - 200 seconds]
[time=722] - Hello, and we are so thankful for this opportunity
[time=734] to talk with you friends again who join us each week for the Bible Hour.
[time=738] Looking into our service schedule, we have some special guests with us today, Don.
[time=743] - We sure do.
[time=744] We've just been listening to the Master's touch and they're going to come back, Rick, and just a few minutes and sing for us again.
[time=749] I'm very, very impressed with this group.
[time=751] They sing so well, but the content of what they say is really tremendous.
[time=755] In the next few minutes, one of the young men, Greg, who is in the group, wrote a song, and he's going to be singing it along with the background from the group.
[time=764] I'm looking forward to that, and I'm sure you folks will enjoy that.
[time=767] - I was so excited to hear them this morning as they were rehearsing before our services, and they truly do have an ability to minister to our hearts.
[time=775] We're looking forward to hearing more from them in just a few moments.
[time=779] Recently, we've been telling you about a little booklet designed to help you in your daily Bible study.
[time=785] Don has a copy of that with him.
[time=787] - This booklet is called Timeless Insights, and if you have not already written for your copy, I encourage you to do that.
[time=794] It's a tremendous little devotional guide, and Pastor Rick, many people have responded to it, and so we want to make this offer available for people who have not yet had that opportunity.
[time=805] What this does is give you a guide for your devotions.
[time=808] Every day, there are some scripture verses, and then there are some timeless insights.
[time=813] In other words, suggestions from great men of the word of God, great theologians like Oswald Chambers, Martin Luther.
[time=821] In this particular issue that I'm holding in my hand, it's April 82, there is a story right in the center entitled Augustine, a man for today, a biograph sketch of this man, and it's a tremendous little book.
[time=834] We'd like you to have it.
[time=836] If you'd like to write to the Bible Hour box, 15,000, 1-500-4 Wayne, Indiana, 468-15, we will send you your copy of Timeless Insights.
[time=849] - I know that will be a tremendous resource for you as you spend time each day with God, studying his word and praying together, we want to share timeless insights with you.
[time=860] We also have another gift that we'd like to share with you.
[time=864] That is a new international version Bible.
[time=866] Many of you are faithful supporters of the Bible Hour, and we have financial needs that continue week by week, and many people have responded so faithfully, and for those of you who are able to send us a $25 gift, we would like to send a gift and return to you a new international version Bible.
[time=886] Don, I've had the opportunity to use that particular book in my own personal study, and it's been a tremendous resource.
[time=894] - I've heard much of the book.
[time=895] I haven't used it myself in my devotions, but I've heard much about it, and I'm looking forward to using it myself.
[time=901] - I believe that a Bible translation has two particular qualities that make it a value.
[time=908] The first is its accuracy.
[time=910] Is it accurate to the original text of our Greek and Hebrew manuscripts?
[time=915] And I believe that the King James Bible is perhaps one of the most accurate texts.
[time=921] Just as well, the new international version is accurate also.
[time=925] I use a King James Bible in my study and in my preaching, but I use a new international version Bible to enhance my study, because the second quality of a good Bible is that it is readable, that you can understand it.
[time=939] The disadvantage of the King James, if there is one, is simply this, that in the last three to 400 years, the English language has changed a great deal.
[time=950] As a matter of fact, if you saw your little granddaughter running into your home and you said, "Oh, what a cute little girl." That's a compliment today.
[time=959] In King James' day, the word cute meant bowlegged.
[time=962] No one would say as their granddaughter ran across the room, "Oh, what a bowlegged little girl." That wouldn't be a compliment.
[time=968] Language changes.
[time=969] Let me share a few examples with you from our study in the book of Philippians.
[time=975] Back in Philippians one and in Philippians three, we came across the word in our King James Bible conversation.
[time=982] Now, when you and I talk about conversation, we think of what we're doing right now, simply talking.
[time=987] But in King James' day, the word conversation meant your way of life, perhaps even your citizenship.
[time=992] There's a big difference there.
[time=994] Another word we might focus in in is found in Philippians three, where the King James Bible says, "Our vile bodies." When I think of vile, I think of something terrible.
[time=1004] But the word vile back then simply meant humble body, and that's a better understanding.
[time=1010] Let me share one final example, and this comes from the book of James.
[time=1013] This is James chapter one, verse 21.
[time=1017] It reads in the King James Bible, "Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls." Now, I understand that because I've labored through that, and I'm a little familiar with the King James language, but here's how the new NIV puts it.
[time=1040] "Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent, and humbly accept the word of God, planted in you, which is able to save you." It's readable, and we wanna send you a copy of that.
[time=1054] Don?
[time=1055] - I was just talking to Don Wertzen about my new Easter cantata a few weeks ago, and he mentioned the fact that much of the things that he writes are from the NIV because it is so readable, and people understand it, and it's in the language of today, and he encouraged me to do the very, very same thing, and we would like you to do the same thing.
[time=1074] If you would like a copy of the NIV, please write to the Bible Hour.
[time=1080] That's box, 15,000, 1500, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and with any gift of $25, we'll send it to you.
[time=1091] We'll thank you for these few moments to talk with you personally, and as we go back to the service, we're looking forward to hearing from Master's Touch once again.
[time=1100] God bless you, stay with us, and have a great day.
[time=1104] (upbeat music)
[time=1121] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=1279] - We would like to sing a song for you now
[time=1290] that I wrote about two years ago.
[time=1292] In Romans 5.1 it says, "Therefore, "since we have been justified by faith, "we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." The word justified in that verse has the idea of a person coming into a courtroom, standing before a judge, and the person hearing the judge say, "You're guilty of a crime," and your guilt has provided punishment for you.
[time=1319] But the judge says, "I have, in my love for you, "I have sacrificed my only son to pay for that guilt, "so that you would not have to bear the wrath of God." That is what God has done for us.
[time=1333] He has sent his son to die on our behalf, that we might live.
[time=1337] (gentle music)
[time=1351] [MUSIC - 162 seconds]
[time=1543] (gentle guitar music) [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=1688] - Thank you very much, master's touch for music
[time=1699] that ministers to our heart.
[time=1701] It always does that when we see Jesus Christ in the song and in the words.
[time=1706] We're so thankful to have you here this morning that we can study God's word together.
[time=1710] Recent weeks we've been studying through the book of Philippians together.
[time=1714] So I invite you to open your Bibles with me to Philippians the fourth chapter.
[time=1719] And we'll be studying today Philippians four verses four through five.
[time=1725] But for context that we might understand the background of this particular passage, I would like to read for you Philippians chapter three verses 20 and 21 and then our text for today.
[time=1738] Philippians three, 20.
[time=1739] For our citizenship or conversation is in heaven
[time=1746] from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our lowly body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[time=1768] And Philippians four, four.
[time=1770] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1774] And again I say, rejoice.
[time=1778] Let your moderation be known unto all men.
[time=1782] The Lord is at hand.
[time=1785] Let us pray together.
[time=1786] Father it is the prayer of our heart that you would have your way within our being.
[time=1793] That we would hear the word of God through the spirit of God and that you might give to our hearts a message for this day.
[time=1801] That there might be within our breast the heartbeat of God that we might know you.
[time=1806] And from knowing you we'd be compelled to love you and to serve you.
[time=1811] Oh Father, we've met in your house on your day to worship you and through our study we worship you in spirit and in truth.
[time=1821] We ask these things in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1826] In the year 490 BC there was a great military might that came out of the east.
[time=1832] The Persian Empire under the leadership of Darius.
[time=1836] They'd crossed the sea of the Aegean Sea and they'd landed many miles north of the city of Athens and we're preparing to march south to take that great city of Greece.
[time=1848] The general who led the Athenian army was a man by the name of Miltiades.
[time=1853] Miltiades determined that if they were to defend their city they could best do it north of the city intercepting the Persian army as it came south.
[time=1863] They selected a strait, a flat area of land between the sea coast and the mountains to defend.
[time=1870] That particular location became famous 'cause it was the strait or the flats of Marathon.
[time=1877] Their 20,000 Persians came upon but 10,000 Greeks.
[time=1883] And so Miltiades called upon a young man, fleet of foot, determinate of heart to run 150 miles from Marathon past Athens to the city of Sparta and to request the might of the Spartans to come defend the Greek peninsula.
[time=1901] The young man came back and he reported
[time=1907] the Spartans would come but it would not be for many days because they had a feast day and a holiday and a religious observant that they felt they had to keep and they could not go to war.
[time=1920] And so Miltiades determined that if they were to fight and to hold that this was the time that they had to stand and they had to fight.
[time=1928] And so at dawn he sent an attack being outnumbered two to one and because of the superior strength of the Greeks and because of their better armament, because of the strategy of Miltiades, they attacked.
[time=1942] In the battle that ensued, 192 Greeks died but they took with them 6,400 Persians and the Persian army retreated north and boarded their ships and they made a plan to sail and capture the city by surprise with the army caught at Marathon.
[time=1961] Miltiades began a forced march by night but he knew that the ships would beat him there and that the city of Athens would be afraid to stand.
[time=1970] And so he called upon that same runner, a young man by the name of Phil podiatists, that young man who had just ran the day before, 150 miles back from the city of Sparta to Marathon took off to run again.
[time=1986] And as he ran, he ran as no other man in history as ever ran and he ran through the gates of Athens very near the same time as the ships of the Persians came up and he ran through the gates of Athens, he screamed, "Rejoice, we conquer!" And he died, he died, he gave his life that men might know that they can rejoice, that they conquered, that the battle was won.
[time=2017] And that same cry leaps out of the pages of the Word of God from the Apostle Paul as he knew beloved that we would face days like these.
[time=2026] He would scream at us, "Rejoice, in Jesus Christ, we conquer!" There is an expectation of the Word of God that we would be like warriors outnumbered in the face of adversity and there would be a strength in our bones that we would cry out, "Rejoice!" And again I say, "Rejoice, Philippians 4, 4."
[time=2048] Within this passage, I have a few brief words, "Rejoice in the Lord, always!" Again I say, "Rejoice!" Just a short sentence, there is a great truth that is taught.
[time=2062] It's important that we understand this passage within the depth of its meaning.
[time=2067] First of all, I'd like to point out to you that this statement is not a conditional statement.
[time=2074] It is the command of God.
[time=2075] God is not simply trying to appease us by occasionally sending a good suggestion or two along the way, then it might be helpful if we had heed.
[time=2085] God has sent forth a command.
[time=2087] When that young man burst through the gates of Athens, he screamed out, "Rejoice!" And God with the same intensity writes an imperative, a command that he expects us to control our attitude this morning.
[time=2101] He says that we are not to be reactionaries, that we are to act, that we are to stand with confidence and with joyful confidence.
[time=2110] It may be simply a matter of semantics this morning, but I'd like to make a distinction for you between joy and happiness.
[time=2119] Happiness I would define as an individual's reaction to his circumstances.
[time=2125] In that, the person has a great week because they rock to the mailbox and as they open up the mailbox, they open up the mailbox and there they pulled out their long-awaited income tax return.
[time=2137] And they have several hundred dollars coming back from our good uncle in Washington.
[time=2141] And they're happy, there's a new spark, there's an input into their life of financial help, and they're happy as a result of that.
[time=2150] But you know, there are some of us here this morning who we do not walk with great anticipation to the mailbox.
[time=2157] We determined that we would quit on line 17 where it gives you the option for the government to figure out the rest because as you figured it, you weren't getting any back, you owed them.
[time=2166] And so you sent it in and uncompleted as you're allowed to, figuring the more time it takes, the more I don't have to worry about it.
[time=2173] And so as you open up your mailbox and Uncle Sam tells you that you owe them 862 dollars, you have a completely different reaction than the first person.
[time=2182] You're not happy.
[time=2184] You see, happiness is our reaction to circumstances around us.
[time=2188] I was not all that happy when I got up this morning.
[time=2191] I thought it was Palm Sunday and everyone knows on Palm Sunday, the ladies are supposed to wear their spring-colored dresses, and then we're supposed to adorn our pastel colored suits, and we're all supposed to glisten in the sunlight.
[time=2203] I just walked and got my winter coat and pulled it up and put a scarf around, walked out of the house, grumbling and complaining.
[time=2211] Did you enjoy summer?
[time=2212] It's gone.
[time=2213] We had two beautiful days this week, and it's gone.
[time=2217] You know, I'm not happy about that.
[time=2219] But you know, God has said that our life is not simply a reaction to the circumstances around us, that if the weather's good, then I'm happy.
[time=2226] And if the weather's bad, I'm miserable.
[time=2228] Friends, you should never live in Indiana if that's how you react.
[time=2231] You see, God doesn't want a reaction.
[time=2236] He wants action.
[time=2237] He wants men and women who are joyful, and I'll make the distinction.
[time=2241] While happiness is the reaction to a set of circumstances, joyful is the predetermined disposition that I will be confident and happy and joyful and positive in spite of the circumstances.
[time=2256] Now, men and women, you say that's absurd.
[time=2259] Paul was living in a dream world.
[time=2262] He was just making lofty aspirations.
[time=2264] You know, many Christians do that today.
[time=2266] They just have a few standard words of vocabulary by which they greet one another.
[time=2272] And so often, it's easy for someone to cross paths with someone else, and that other person looks a little bit down, and they just pat them on the back with a chipper.
[time=2281] Oh, cheer up and praise the Lord anyhow.
[time=2284] Was that Paul's background?
[time=2285] Was he just playing head games?
[time=2287] Was he saying, ignore the fact that you're in a declining population.
[time=2290] Forget the fact that the rate of unemployment is steadily growing.
[time=2294] Just pretend it's all gonna be better.
[time=2296] Just picture in your mind everybody in America driving an international harvester scout, and everything will be better.
[time=2303] Was God playing head games?
[time=2304] Is that what always he wanted to pretend the problem's not there?
[time=2307] Just look at this beautiful roof and forget that it leaks.
[time=2312] Is that what God's doing, just playing head games?
[time=2314] A psychiatrist was explaining to a friend, in front of a group of people, what the difference between a psychotic and neurotic?
[time=2322] A psychotic, he said, is someone that builds dream castles in their mind.
[time=2326] A neurotic is someone that lives in the dream castles.
[time=2329] And the man interrupted him and said, yes, and the psychiatrist collects rent on both of them.
[time=2333] (audience laughing) Now, is that what it is?
[time=2337] Do we have some type of psychosis and neurosis that we're gonna ignore the world around, and we're just gonna pretend it's all gonna be better, and we're just going to rejoice in the Lord.
[time=2347] Was Paul somewhat detached from reality?
[time=2350] Oh no, men and women, I believe here's how Paul wrote this passage.
[time=2354] He said, "Rejoice in the Lord always." And then he thought, hmm, I'm in prison.
[time=2361] They've been killing Christians lately.
[time=2364] They've got plans on killing me.
[time=2366] As a matter of fact, I've got other problems.
[time=2368] The Church of Philippi is behind in their missionary support.
[time=2372] He said, "A paphroditus has nearly died, "and as his mind races through all these problems "of the context of his statement, he stopped and he said, "And again, I say rejoice." For Paul, the book of Philippians, is a defiant, nevertheless, in Christ Jesus, I will rejoice.
[time=2394] Men and women, this isn't dreaming.
[time=2397] This isn't ignoring problems.
[time=2398] This is a confidence that the Apostle Paul had.
[time=2401] He gave it as a command because he had learned it as a command that he was to maintain an attitude.
[time=2407] Do you know if there is to be a winsomeness about us?
[time=2410] If the world is to see Jesus Christ in you and me, then there needs to be within our life a confidence in God.
[time=2418] That although the world may crumble, although the economy may be falling, although Reaganomics may not be keeping pace with our expectation, there's a confidence.
[time=2428] What would be the cause of that confidence?
[time=2430] We find it in the verse.
[time=2431] Doesn't just blankantly say rejoice.
[time=2434] He says, "Rejoice in the Lord." And that returns us to the word I've used with you so often, beloved, the word of perspective.
[time=2443] Now, if your perspective is that you live and die and your daily devotions come every morning out of the Wall Street Journal, you may have great cause for fear.
[time=2453] If your only input from hope is to read the US News World reports account on what cities have a high unemployment rate, and you won't have much occasion to rejoice this morning.
[time=2464] But men and women, if you have a different perspective, there's cause for rejoicing today.
[time=2469] What would the apostle Paul give us as causes?
[time=2471] You know, I believe in this epistle, he has woven the theme of rejoicing all the way through.
[time=2476] It came up early in chapter one.
[time=2478] Repeatedly in chapter one.
[time=2479] It pops up in chapter two.
[time=2481] And then in verse three, he begins by saying finally, and that's proof that Paul was a Baptist, because he said finally, and then he went on for twice as far as he had already gone, but he said finally rejoicing the Lord, and now he's telling us to rejoice again.
[time=2494] Now, why would he say that?
[time=2495] I believe he's trying to give to them a concept of hope and what they can rejoice in.
[time=2501] There are many things we could draw out of this book, but there are three themes that keep coming up as Paul's confidence, first confidence, that God had a hold of him, and that God would never let go.
[time=2513] We call that the security of the believer.
[time=2516] Paul began by saying, I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you, he will continue it again until the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=2527] Paul looked at his own life and he could rejoice with such confidence, and he said, it doesn't matter whether I live or whether I die.
[time=2533] For me to live is Christ in the day is game.
[time=2536] He had a confidence that God had a hold of his life, and that God would never let go.
[time=2543] Secondly, Paul had a confidence, not only in God keeping him as a believer, he had a confident expectation that Jesus Christ was coming again.
[time=2552] He told them that they could stand fast, new Lord.
[time=2555] Why could they stand fast, Lord?
[time=2558] Because their citizenship was in heaven from whence they look for the coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=2564] Paul knew that Christ was coming again.
[time=2568] You know, we can endure almost anything today if we can simply see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[time=2575] And Paul had a concept that his life was not simply going to live forever in a Roman prison, that if he died he went to be the Lord, but if he lived that someday Christ was coming and that was sufficient power to compel him to live for that day.
[time=2592] Lift up your head, beloved, redemption, draw at night.
[time=2596] Paul had a confidence that Jesus Christ was coming again.
[time=2601] Then Paul had a third confidence and that was this.
[time=2604] He could rejoice in spite of the circumstances because he had a confidence that God would supply his every need from that day until the day that God took him or that Christ came for him.
[time=2618] He said, "But my God shall supply all of your needs "according to his riches in Christ Jesus." You know, if you live by that perspective, you have confidence.
[time=2631] If you live by the perspective that I know Christ is Savior, I am in him and he has a hold of me.
[time=2637] And you live by the confidence that he's coming for you.
[time=2640] And then there's blended in without the confidence that he'll meet your every need between now and then.
[time=2646] Beloved, you'll learn to rejoice in every situation.
[time=2651] There's a great deal of difference between these phrases that sound alike.
[time=2656] The phrase because of and the phrase in spite of.
[time=2661] Beloved, we are joyful, not simply because of, but in spite of the circumstances of life.
[time=2670] To be in the Lord.
[time=2672] You know, when we come to Jesus Christ as Savior, there's a transformation that takes place.
[time=2676] There's a new birth and most of you have experienced it this morning, but many of you have not.
[time=2681] But once you come to Christ, the battle is not completely over.
[time=2687] There's the need to grow in the Lord.
[time=2690] And as you grow in the Lord and you replace your earthly perspective with his eternal perspective, there comes a confidence and you can rejoice this morning.
[time=2700] Paul so often likens the Christian life to a race.
[time=2705] On this occasion, he likens it to the first marathon when a man would pour his life into a race that he might proclaim one message.
[time=2713] Rejoice, we conquer.
[time=2716] Well, this particular instruction comes as the third in a series of seven instructions.
[time=2723] The first two we saw last week.
[time=2726] We saw that we were to stand fast.
[time=2728] Secondly, we saw we were to stand united.
[time=2730] Now we discover that we are to stand rejoicing.
[time=2734] Verse five, the fourth instruction.
[time=2737] Let your moderation be known unto all men.
[time=2741] That tells us that as we stand fast, as we stand rejoicing, we stand united, we are to stand in moderation.
[time=2748] I'd like to explain that word to you a little bit.
[time=2751] The language of man always changes.
[time=2754] We do not mean moderation in the sense that you do something moderately means you don't get real excited.
[time=2762] You just kind of go at it.
[time=2764] Kindly, moderately, gracefully, not ruffling any feathers.
[time=2770] That's not actually what the word meant in the King James day.
[time=2774] Many translations put in other words.
[time=2776] Let me suggest some others.
[time=2778] Let your moderation be known.
[time=2780] Or let your gracious spirit be known.
[time=2783] Or let your sweet reasonableness be known.
[time=2787] Or let your forbearance be understood by all men.
[time=2791] I guess it's forbearance that I like the best of all.
[time=2794] forbearance is actually a legal word.
[time=2798] That I have the right that if you damage my property that I have the right under civil law to sue you for the damage of that property.
[time=2807] Therefore, if I sue you, I am exercising my legal right.
[time=2814] The word forbear means to give up your legal right to protect your own interest.
[time=2821] What God was saying is that we are not only to be rejoicing, but that we are to be forbearing.
[time=2827] That means we are willing to be suffered being mistreated, suffer being wrong.
[time=2833] But even if it's not a matter of right or wrong, that we just have a gracious, positive spirit.
[time=2839] Now let me first of all point out, Paul was not applying this to doctrine.
[time=2843] I mean, Paul wasn't looking at false teachers.
[time=2845] Men who denied the resurrection of Christ are denied the true plan of salvation by faith in Christ.
[time=2851] He wasn't saying, just kind of blend everybody together and get along.
[time=2855] Now he had a different perspective.
[time=2857] Here's his perspective on false teachers.
[time=2860] Chapter three, verse two, beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of concision.
[time=2867] He came down harshly on false doctrine.
[time=2872] He came down harshly on false behavior.
[time=2875] In other words, ungodly living.
[time=2877] But when it came to the ability of the body to love one another and to tolerate one another and to be willing to suffer being mistreated, he had a far different perspective, a far different perspective.
[time=2891] He was saying that they were to allow one another to be different and when somebody stepped on their toes, they were not to demand the right to step back on their toes.
[time=2902] You've heard the expression, I don't get mad.
[time=2905] I just get even.
[time=2907] Now that is not the expression that God would have to be characteristic of our life.
[time=2912] We're not really not to get mad, but we're not to get even either.
[time=2915] We're to be great forgivers.
[time=2917] There are some people in our society who are magnanimous.
[time=2920] They seem to have the ability to always set forth graciousness.
[time=2925] I was so pleased and so impressed with the coach of Georgetown University.
[time=2932] His team had lost, on a mental hair, they lost the national championship.
[time=2937] If there was ever a time to be down, to be discouraged, to be critical, there was the time.
[time=2943] Within moments of that heartbreak, you know what, they zoom those TV cameras right in on your nose and they start asking picky little questions, trying to get an emotional response.
[time=2952] And they were leading him and they said, now coach, didn't you feel like maybe you, you really had a few bad calls in the game?
[time=2959] And boy, what an opportunity for a coach to say, yeah boy, they missed that call in to this basket and now over they'll show, oh boy, did those reps blow it.
[time=2966] You know what he said?
[time=2970] He said, oh no.
[time=2971] He said, I wouldn't want to crowd the issue of a tremendous basketball game and a great win by calling something like that.
[time=2979] Oh, I was so pleased.
[time=2982] I was so pleased to hear someone within the realm of athletics who wasn't so egotistical that the whole world was wrong and they were right.
[time=2991] There wasn't someone who demanded that somebody else be blamed for their loss.
[time=2996] I was pleased to see a magnanimous man.
[time=2999] Anybody as big as he is his magnanimous, but I mean magnanimous of heart.
[time=3004] Someone who could look at a situation not say, yes, I think if that call would have gone different than my outcome would have been different.
[time=3011] That's what God expects out of us, beloved.
[time=3014] When someone mistreats us, when someone criticizes us, and it's not fair, when someone speaks evil of our good.
[time=3022] There's to be some spirit that says, oh no, I wouldn't want to confuse the issue of the love that I have for that brother by arguing over something so small as that, so small as that.
[time=3033] The ability to forgive, the ability to heal.
[time=3036] And he said, let it be known unto all men.
[time=3039] Do you know what is going to attract people to this church?
[time=3042] It isn't this beautiful building.
[time=3043] It is an attractive building.
[time=3045] But it's not going to be the fact that there's a large crowd of people here every Sunday.
[time=3049] I'm thankful for that, and it is a tremendous testimony to see a parking lot overflowing across the street.
[time=3055] But what's going to attract people is when they see that we love one another, and there's a sweet spirit in this place, a bond, a forgiveness.
[time=3064] Do you know the test of a church is its ability to get along, one with another?
[time=3069] John Kennedy came to the floor of the US Senate with a great deal of pomp and circumstance.
[time=3076] He was a Kennedy.
[time=3077] He had won the election in the state of Massachusetts, and as he walked in as a freshman senator, he said he got some of the best advice he ever got in his life.
[time=3086] That was when a senior senator came up to him, put his arm around him and said, Mr. Kennedy, it's good that you know something about the Senate.
[time=3095] Young man, the best way to get along is to get along.
[time=3104] If you don't get along with people, it may not be that all of us are half a step off cycle.
[time=3110] It could be you.
[time=3112] And God says, let your gracious, for bearing, winsome, moderate, sweet, reasonable of us, be known unto all men.
[time=3121] May you be viewed as one of those people who are easy to get along with, sweet to encounter.
[time=3128] Why should you be that way?
[time=3130] Why should you be willing to suffer wrong?
[time=3133] I mean, if it's his fault, I mean, shouldn't you stand for the principle of the thing?
[time=3137] No, I'm always amused that when people are arguing over money, are people are arguing over property, are people who are arguing over rights, they always say something to make themselves look so noble.
[time=3150] It usually goes like this.
[time=3151] Well, it's not the money that's an issue.
[time=3153] It's the principle of the thing.
[time=3156] Can I tell you what the principle of the thing is?
[time=3158] The principle of the thing is that you and I forbear, that you and I forgive, that you and I have a sweet reasonableness.
[time=3165] God has not called us to implement corrective behavior on the rest of the people.
[time=3170] The principle is the thing that we forgive one another in love, and that is to be so characteristic of our life that all men see it, that it's our light, that it's our salt, and beloved without it, we are salt that loses its savior, its savior.
[time=3188] Salt has a savior that causes it to make light come alive in food.
[time=3194] I know the Time magazine ran a special on how bad salt is, but I can't give that one up yet.
[time=3199] I love salt, it just brings the flavor out and things.
[time=3202] You know, God's placed us here that we can bring the flavor out.
[time=3206] There can be a sweetness and a tastfulness about us, and that should be seen by all men.
[time=3212] Why is that?
[time=3213] Because the Lord is at hand.
[time=3216] We could take this two possible ways.
[time=3218] We could take it in the sense of that God is on the present, that even though I'm in a debate and a dispute with this person, that God is present there, and beloved oh how it changes our behavior when we sense that someone else is there.
[time=3234] You know, there are many things that I would say, and I would do if I thought no one would ever catch me.
[time=3240] But if I think you're watching, oh, there's a difference in my behavior.
[time=3244] Some good friends were over last evening, and they were asking some questions, and I was answering the question, and he said, okay, forget it.
[time=3251] You're playing your pastoral role, and you're not gonna answer your question.
[time=3254] You know, there's a game that we often play.
[time=3256] We put on our pastoral role, and we put on our Christian role, because we think someone's watching, but otherwise we just let it fly.
[time=3263] Could be the Paul was saying that God is at hand, because the book of Proverbs says that the eyes of the Lord are in all places beholding good and evil.
[time=3272] It could be that he was saying guard your attitude because God sees it.
[time=3276] It could also be, though, that he was saying that Jesus Christ is about to come back at any time.
[time=3282] He's at the door.
[time=3284] The phraseology is very similar in the original language to the Aramaic word, marinatha.
[time=3288] He is coming.
[time=3289] The Lord comes quickly.
[time=3291] And it could be that Paul was saying, endure it, beloved, because it's almost the end of the race.
[time=3298] Do you know that many of you today are not feeling too good?
[time=3302] You're just not where you would like to be in your health.
[time=3305] You're just a little bit sluggish, tired, a little bit achy, rheumatism, arthritis, lumbagos, flared up because the cold is returned.
[time=3313] And a lot of that is physiological.
[time=3315] But you know that many of you, beloved, are not well today.
[time=3319] And it's not physiological.
[time=3321] It's spiritual.
[time=3322] The Proverbs says this, "That a cheerful heart doth good like medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones." Any doctor will tell you that often they encounter patients who there is no physical problem with them.
[time=3342] Their problem is spiritual, mental, or emotional.
[time=3345] And it's manifesting itself in a physical way.
[time=3348] But there's healing in the spirit of God that if we learn to rejoice in Him, and if we learn not only to rejoice in Him, but if we learn to forgive Him and to forbear as He has foreborn us that there is tremendous healing in the Word of God and in the spirit of God.
[time=3367] Can you imagine the impact on the city of Athens as a young man came through the gate, obviously exhausted from running 25 miles from the flats of marathon to the city and screaming out with his lungs, greatest power, rejoice, we conquer what that did to instill confidence in those people, beloved, we should be rejoicing today because the battle is over.
[time=3396] The victory's been won and Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=3401] You and I are simply His occupational force helping people to see the death of Jesus Christ has set them free from their sins, rejoice evermore.
[time=3413] Let's bow together in prayer, rejoice evermore in the Lord.
[time=3418] You can do that if you by faith are in the Lord
[time=3424] and you have received Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3427] If you have not, perhaps this is the time that God is calling you.
[time=3432] This is the time He's saying to you, I've come for you.
[time=3437] I've died for your sins, receive me.
[time=3443] You've been sharing the message this morning
[time=3460] with Pastor Rick Hawkes here on the Bible Hour in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3468] If as a result of today's message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3473] We invite you to pray this prayer with us right now.
[time=3477] Dear Father, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.
[time=3482] But today I accept Him as my own personal Savior.
[time=3487] I believe that He died for me and in my place.
[time=3490] And I transfer my faith in what I have been believing
[time=3496] unto Jesus Christ alone for my salvation.
[time=3500] And I thank You for saving me.
[time=3502] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3507] My friend, if as you've prayed that prayer, you desire with all your heart to have Jesus Christ as your Savior and you believe that He died for you, the Bible says you are saved.
