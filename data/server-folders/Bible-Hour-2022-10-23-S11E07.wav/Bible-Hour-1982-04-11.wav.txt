[time=86] (Bell) (Bell) (Bell) (Bell) Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=106] This week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=112] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion,
[time=119] and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=124] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=129] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prooger
[time=135] will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=140] Also, on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians
[time=146] and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=149] Now, here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=158] Join not only to share the ministry of this church with you, but our friends who join us each day for the Bible Hour.
[time=167] It's delight through the ministry of television to go into the homes, the prisons, into institutions, hospitals to share the joy that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=177] And today, it's Easter Sunday, and we celebrate that in a special way.
[time=181] We welcome you this morning.
[time=183] We invite you to worship with us in spirit and in truth.
[time=186] Our choir is going to sing for us now.
[time=188] Great songs of praises.
[time=190] Christ the Lord is risen today, taken from the Easter cantata that they'll be singing tonight,
[time=196] but for you this morning to direct our praise.
[time=199] The Easter music al singers under the direction of Don Prooger sing, Christ the Lord is risen today.
[time=209] Christ the Lord is risen today.
[time=228] Hallelujah.
[time=232] The sons of men and angels sing.
[time=237] Hallelujah.
[time=240] Praise your joys and joy also.
[time=245] Hallelujah.
[time=249] Singing and tender people.
[time=253] Hallelujah.
[time=259] Christ the Lord is risen today.
[time=273] Hallelujah.
[time=397] We invite you to sing now with us Him number 176 Christ arose.
[time=403] You're watching on TV.
[time=404] We want you to sing that right along.
[time=406] Beautiful Him of the church that speaks of the fact that Jesus is alive.
[time=411] Shall we stand now as we sing this great hymn?
[time=415] (Organ music playing)
[time=421] Oh, in the great He led,
[time=427] Jesus my Savior,
[time=433] Waving the glory day,
[time=440] Jesus my Lord, Up the freaky hall, When Christ, He tried not his heart.
[time=453] He aroused the victor from the time through Him, And He led forever in His hands to pray.
[time=462] He aroused,
[time=474] Hallelujah.
[time=477] Christ, Hallelujah.
[time=483] Hallelujah.
[time=486] We want Him, Jesus my Savior, Waving the glory day,
[time=502] Jesus my Lord,
[time=508] Up the freaky hall, When He tried not his heart, He aroused the victor from the dark building, And He gave forever in His hands to pray.
[time=527] He aroused, He aroused.
[time=536] Hallelujah.
[time=542] Christ, Hallelujah.
[time=564] Jesus my Lord,
[time=571] Up the freaky hall, When Christ, He tried not his heart.
[time=579] He aroused the victor from the dark building, And He led forever in His hands to pray.
[time=590] Hallelujah.
[time=601] Christ,
[time=610] All God's people said, "Thank you and you may be seated." There are no more thrilling songs in all of Him knowledge than the songs that speak of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=624] We're so glad to have Keith and Star in our world with us.
[time=628] Oh, I said the wrong thing.

[time=727] Good morning.
[time=728] It is morning.
[time=729] Here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and a special morning.
[time=732] Today is Easter morning, and Don and I are sitting here in front of the set for our Easter music house.
[time=738] We've been experiencing a tremendous few nights here, Pastor Rick.
[time=742] We've been presenting to the congregation and to the city of Fort Wayne, our Easter celebration.
[time=748] We're calling it sacred songs and scenes.
[time=751] And we have one of the scenes here in just a few more minutes.
[time=755] You'll see some of the songs that go along with these scenes.
[time=759] It's been the presentation of the cantata, the fourth cross by Derek Johnson.
[time=763] We've just been having an exciting time at this Easter holiday.
[time=767] Don, I've certainly enjoyed it and appreciated the ministry of music that focuses in on the fact that Christ died for our sins and that He rose again.
[time=776] This is an exciting day to worship and to praise the Lord.
[time=779] One of the best ways we can do that is by paying attention to His Word.
[time=784] Jesus said, "Search the scriptures for they testify of Me." Don, you have a little booklet that helps us to search the scriptures called Timeless Insights.
[time=794] We've been offering this book, Pastor Rick, to those who've been writing in.
[time=797] And maybe you have neglected to do so, but please write to us today and get this little devotional guide called Timeless Insights.
[time=805] What it has is a verse of scripture for every day, then an explanation of that verse, and then a timeless insight, a thought to enhance that scripture verse,
[time=816] given by great men like John Calvin, Harry Ironsides, Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
[time=821] It's a tremendous little book, Timeless Insights, and it's yours simply by writing and asking for it.
[time=828] We want you to write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, 150,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we'll send to you this booklet,
[time=839] a devotional guide, to help you in your spiritual life called Timeless Insights.
[time=845] I believe the greatest resource that we could give to you is a Bible and tools to help you understand the Bible.
[time=853] So along with this booklet, Timeless Insights, we want to offer to you a New Testament that I believe will be of great help to you.
[time=860] It's a new international version, New Testament.
[time=864] Every Sunday morning when I speak here on the Bible Hour, I use my King James Bible.
[time=870] I believe it's an accurate text, and I believe it's probably the most common text.
[time=875] But because language is dynamic and it changes, words are different than they were in the day of King James back in the 1600s.
[time=883] The new international version, New Testament, puts the Bible accurately in today's English.
[time=890] We'd like to send you a copy of that if you would be able to help us with our financial needs of this ministry.
[time=896] If you're able to send us a gift of $25 or more, we'd like to send that New Testament to you.
[time=902] We want you to send it to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, 150,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, and we would be glad to send you your copy of the NIV version of the Word of God.
[time=919] We're thankful that you are a friend of this ministry and that you watch it regularly and that we have the opportunity through music and through the spoken word to tell you about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=931] We're so excited today to tell you about the resurrection of Christ.
[time=935] Some of the music will focus in on that. What should we be looking for, Don?
[time=939] Well, in just a few minutes we're going to be listening to Al and Lenna Peterson, who have always blessed our hearts and they're going to be ministering and singing for us.
[time=948] I know one of the songs they're going to be using is the song "Worthy is the Lamb" that was slain.
[time=952] So we're in for a real treat. What are you going to be speaking on Pastor Rick?
[time=956] I'm going to speak on the subject entitled "History and Hope." Paul wrote a document of history in 1 Corinthians 15th chapter saying that Christ died for our sins, that he was buried and that he rose again.
[time=970] Those are the facts of history. But because of those facts, we have great hope.
[time=975] I'm looking forward to sharing with you four points of hope that we have those believers because of the history that Jesus Christ loved us and he died for our sins.
[time=985] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. Again, we encourage you to write to us whether you're able to help financially or not.
[time=993] We love hearing from you. Won't you write to us today?
[time=997] Once again, our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1008] Stay with us now for the ministry of music and a message from God's Word.
[time=1027] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1439] [MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1448] Thank you, Lena. Let us bow together in prayer.
[time=1451] Our father, the question has been asked.
[time=1454] Were we there when Jesus Christ, or Lord, was crucified?
[time=1458] Father, we were not there in person, but our sins were there, and He died for our sins, and we thank you.
[time=1465] We bow before you and heart today to worship you, and they ask you to be the one that would speak to our hearts, that we might hear the Spirit of God tugging, pulling, and directing us within all of our being.
[time=1479] Speak to us, Father, through your word, for it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1486] It was in the year 1788 that a Scottish geologist by the name of James Hutton
[time=1492] set forth what was to later be called the doctrine or the law of uniformitarianism.
[time=1499] That scientific law simply stated is that whatever processes are going on
[time=1505] in the realm of nature have always been going on in the realm of nature, and there were no processes in the past that took place that are not taking place today.
[time=1517] It gives us to us a philosophy of life that is completely naturalistic.
[time=1522] What that does is it precludes the supernatural, in that if there is not a supernatural demonstration that I can observe today, then because of uniformitarianism there could not have been a supernatural act in the past.
[time=1536] That model of geology has been transferred far beyond the scope of the realm of physical science into the philosophy of religion.
[time=1544] And so the naturalist says to us today that whatever our concepts of religion may be,
[time=1551] they must be limited by the scope of naturalism.
[time=1555] The naturalist says that there are scientific laws, and these laws not only govern the affairs of the earth, but they are the limitations, and anything that would stand as a counter-diction to scientific natural law is an impossibility.
[time=1571] We meet this morning in direct opposition to uniformitarianism, to actualism, to naturalism.
[time=1581] This very day we have gathered on Sunday, on Easter Sunday,
[time=1587] because we believe that there is a God, a God who, yes, did create the laws by which nature observes its pattern and its processes.
[time=1596] And I believe in the law of uniformitarianism, however, I believe that that law was created by a God who set that law into place
[time=1605] and a God who has the power to reach within creation and to make an exception.
[time=1611] And that Jesus Christ, His resurrection, is the exception to God's natural law.
[time=1619] That God violated the laws of nature in a supernatural way raised Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=1628] Beloved, that's our hope this morning.
[time=1630] It's our very foundation of confidence as believers.
[time=1634] If we really do not believe that God is able to interrupt the natural processes of His creation
[time=1640] and raise Christ from the dead, then to come and to read the accounts of Matthew or Mark or Luke this morning
[time=1647] would be about as meaningful as for me to say.
[time=1650] Now open the text today and I'll read for you.
[time=1653] Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary land, its lamb was sure to go.
[time=1659] It's just a story, just a fairy tale.
[time=1662] Oh, perhaps the situation is a little bit more believable, but the punchline is not.
[time=1669] Today we have to ask some questions, questions about history.
[time=1676] Did God send His Son Jesus Christ and was Jesus Christ literally raised from the dead?
[time=1683] If He is, then that is the foundation for hope.
[time=1687] If He is not the Son of God and He was not raised from the dead, then we are of all men, most miserable.
[time=1695] Our hope today is rooted in history.
[time=1699] I invite you to open your Bible with me if you will to 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter.
[time=1704] In 1 Corinthians 15 we found a brief report of the facts of the gospel.
[time=1712] If we turn to Matthew, Mark or Luke, we would find the synoptic gospels giving to us an account of the life of Christ
[time=1719] with a great deal of emphasis on His final week, His triumphal entry, His suffering, His death, His resurrection, His ascension.
[time=1727] If we turn to John, a non-synoptic gospel, we would find a great number of events that the others didn't record,
[time=1735] giving to us a fuller picture of the life of Christ.
[time=1739] But in 1 Corinthians 15 we have just the facts, four facts of history that the Apostle Paul would set forth as the foundation of hope.
[time=1750] I'll read for you this morning from my Bible verses 3 through 8 of 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter.
[time=1758] For I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
[time=1771] and that He was buried, and that He arose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen of Cephas and of the 12.
[time=1783] After that He was seen above 500 brethren at once, of whom the greater part remained under this present time, but some are fallen asleep.
[time=1795] That is a euphemism for death. After that He was seen of James, then of all the apostles, and last of all He was seen of me also as one worn out of due time.
[time=1809] Here Paul outlines for us four facts of history that he sets forth as facts to be received and to believe.
[time=1818] Fact number one Paul says is that Jesus Christ died. The death of Jesus Christ stands as the first fact of the apostles' great declaration.
[time=1830] So often we're a little squeamish or even embarrassed to hear great discussions about the death of Jesus Christ.
[time=1837] One man said to a preacher, "Why is it that you always talk about the death of Christ? We should hear more of the example of Christ."
[time=1846] The pastor said, "Well, I'll give you the example of Christ. He who knew no sin. Can you follow that example?"
[time=1854] The man said, "Well, no, I cannot." The preacher said, "That is why I preach about the death of Christ. We need a Savior."
[time=1862] Not an example. The Scripture says that Jesus Christ literally died, that He died and that He was buried.
[time=1870] The evidence for His death is very strong. First of all Jesus Christ was crucified and He was declared dead by a Roman executioner
[time=1880] an expert, if you will, in pronouncing people dead.
[time=1885] As a matter of fact, because it was a holiday, a holy day, a feast day, they came with the intention of making the death quick of all the mal factors that were crucified.
[time=1897] The way they would do that is as the executed person was hanging on the cross, he would be able to lift himself up to breathe and to prevent suffocation.
[time=1907] So to hasten death, they would break the leg so that that person could not raise himself and death would come almost immediately.
[time=1915] And when they came to Jesus Christ, this expert noted that he was already dead.
[time=1922] Not only do we have the testimony of that executioner, we have the evidence of his body.
[time=1929] The Christ body was pierced right below the heart and coming out of that wound was blood and water.
[time=1939] Indicative of the fact that he was already dead, medical experts have done a great deal of examination
[time=1946] and believe that that is indicating that he died of a combination of effects, suffocation, and a ruptured heart.
[time=1954] And that separated blood and water was physical evidence that he was dead.
[time=1960] But then beyond that, there is more.
[time=1963] A man by the name of Nicodemus, and another man by the name of Joseph, of Arimathea, went to Pontius Pilate requesting the body of Christ that they might prepare it for burial and burial.
[time=1975] And because Pilate was well aware of the commotion that surrounded this individual, Jesus, he wanted to make certain that he was dead.
[time=1984] And so he double checked with the soldiers on duty and they made sure that he was dead and the assured Pilate that he was dead.
[time=1995] Christ did not swoon on the cross. He did not simply pass out and enter into a coma or a semi-comatose condition.
[time=2004] And from there he was removed and revived in a tomb as the swoon theory would lead us to believe.
[time=2011] He was dead. Paul sets it forth as a fact, and the evidence is given to us throughout the pages of the New Testament.
[time=2020] And the testimony of even those who were hostile to Christ in his claims. He was dead.
[time=2027] But beyond that, it is mentioned that he was buried and that he was buried for three days.
[time=2032] That is a confirmation of the death of Christ, but we want to place our emphasis this morning on the fact that he was buried for three days.
[time=2040] Much has been written beyond death and dying by Raymond Moody and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, and a whole series of books have come out about life after death.
[time=2049] And giving to us testimonies of people who supposedly died and came back to life.
[time=2055] There is a great point of distinction.
[time=2058] Those testimonies do not come from people who were supposedly dead for three days.
[time=2063] Oh, nowhere close to three hours. Three minutes would be an exaggeration. Three seconds more of the case.
[time=2071] What is taking place in these events is that someone is entering into a near death experience where their body literally loses its vital signs,
[time=2081] but it is immediately resuscitated through an inhalator, a respirator, through CPR, electrical shock placed upon their body to bring those vital signs back.
[time=2092] And there is a consciousness of a near death experience.
[time=2096] Jesus Christ was not a near death experience of a matter of seconds, and then his body being resuscitated, he was dead for three days.
[time=2105] There is no account. There is no medical person who would ever believe that a man who was dead for three days could be put on any type of life recovery system and be brought back to life.
[time=2117] He was dead. Fact number two, he was buried. Fact number three is what we celebrate today.
[time=2125] That Jesus Christ literally bodily arose out of the grave, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=2132] It becomes the foundation of Paul's argument, not only in this chapter, but it becomes the very foundation, the bedrock of all of Christianity.
[time=2140] The Christ literally arose from the grave. Paul could cite a great deal of evidence to support the resurrection.
[time=2149] He could cite the stone that was rolled away. He could point out that there was an empty tomb carved out of rock with a stone placed in front of it that indicates that Jesus Christ arose.
[time=2161] But his fourth fact of history is far more compelling evidence. It is that he was seen.
[time=2168] First of all, he said he was seen by Cephas. Cephas is the same man who you and I relate to as Simon Peter.
[time=2174] Cephas, an Aramaic name, Peter a Greek name.
[time=2177] Besides, I'm not really persuaded by Peter. Peter was a prejudice witness. He was a friend. He had personal interest.
[time=2185] He himself had much to be gained by the resurrection of Christ. Then it says of the 12. Actually, that was not the 12 disciples.
[time=2193] It was 11 of the 12. Judas was dead, but that became a name of identification. It was used as the disciples often.
[time=2201] Even when Thomas was absent and there were only 10, they were often called the 12. But again, we have prejudice witnesses.
[time=2208] Then it says that he was seen of above 500 brethren at once.
[time=2215] There is irrefutable evidence.
[time=2218] If you and I were going to fabricate a myth, I've shared with you in a Sunday evening message a formula that would be necessary.
[time=2225] The formula for fabricating a myth and passing it on requires two facts.
[time=2231] It requires a minimal number of witnesses and secondly a maximum amount of time.
[time=2239] Suppose we wanted to fabricate a myth out of the hundreds of us here this morning. That would be impossible.
[time=2245] It would be too difficult to get all of these people in this auditorium to believe a complete lie.
[time=2251] Let me make up one. Let's suppose the fabrication that we were to create was that I could actually flap my arms and fly.
[time=2259] My name is Hawks. That certainly sounds believable.
[time=2262] You laugh. My wife's maiden name was Bird. Her parents lived next door to the crows.
[time=2268] Her grandmother's maiden name was the twig and it's a very flighty family.
[time=2272] But suppose we were going to make up this story this morning that I could fly.
[time=2276] First of all, what we'd have to do is we'd have to minimize the witnesses.
[time=2280] There's far too many of you here to believe that all of you people are actually going to go out of here and you're going to consistently maintain the testimony that you saw this guy fly.
[time=2290] Actually, it's really embarrassing that we have television cameras this morning.
[time=2294] You want to minimize the witnesses. Let's do it with no TV cameras.
[time=2298] Let's get everyone out of here and let's have a relatively small number of people. Two or three.
[time=2304] And then let's maximize the time. It would be best if you could wait until I died.
[time=2309] That way no one can say, "Well, if he can fly, let's see him fly." Oh, I'm sorry. He died.
[time=2313] Convenient, isn't it? Well, let's go investigate the witnesses.
[time=2318] Oh, I'm sorry to say they died too. But really, it's true. Hawks flew.
[time=2323] See, no one's going to believe that. And there's obviously got to be a lack of witnesses
[time=2329] and a long time span to make such a story believable.
[time=2333] But what Paul does is he argues from two angles. His first angle is the angle that there were 500 people at once.
[time=2342] The gospels recount somewhere around 17 post-resurrection appearances of Christ.
[time=2348] And here Paul is saying that at one time, 500 people once saw him.
[time=2354] That's too many people to simply have talked them into going along with a joke.
[time=2359] Or to have 500 people somehow believe that it was to their advantage to propagate a lie and to stand by it, even into death.
[time=2367] Now, that's far too many people. But Paul not only argues from the number of people, but he argues from proximity for he says of these 500 people, the greater part are the majority of them are still alive.
[time=2379] Now, some of them have fallen asleep. Some of them have died.
[time=2382] But the majority are still alive. What he is saying is implied that if you don't believe me,
[time=2388] you can go and you can examine the witnesses themselves.
[time=2393] Then he cites his own personal illustration.
[time=2398] That is an excellent illustration because Paul himself was never the protagonist of Christ.
[time=2404] He was always the antagonist. Paul was the one who stood by and held the coats of men
[time=2410] so that they could stone Stephen and put him to death to silence the spread of this rumor
[time=2416] that Christ had risen from the grave.
[time=2419] It was Paul that had wreaked havoc in the Church of Jerusalem, dispersing them throughout Samaria, Judea, Pariah, as far north as Syria and Antioch.
[time=2428] It was Paul who was known as the one to be feared amongst all the Christians.
[time=2434] And there was even suspicion when Paul presented himself as a Christian that other believers were suspicious that he was just playing their role that can decently sneak into the ranks, to determine who was a believer, that he might later arrest them and have them put to death.
[time=2452] Paul was the antagonist.
[time=2454] And when Paul's life was changed, there perhaps was no greater evidence than the conversion of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2461] So dynamic was his conversion that George Littleton, writing in the 1700s,
[time=2468] collaborated with Sir Gilbert West, that if they were to disprove Christianity, they had to refute the resurrection and to refute the conversion of Paul.
[time=2477] And so Sir Gilbert West set out on his journey and George Littleton on his.
[time=2482] And Littleton investigated the claims of the Apostle Paul in his conversion, hoping to disprove it and came back, a believer in Jesus Christ, because when this antagonist became the greatest protagonist, Christianity was validated only on one basis.
[time=2498] It could be explained in no other way than that Paul had seen the resurrected Christ.
[time=2504] So from history, we have an argument, four stages of argumentation.
[time=2511] Christ died. Christ was buried.
[time=2515] Christ arose from the grave, and the evidence, .4, Christ was seen.
[time=2523] That becomes the foundation for the hope of the believer.
[time=2526] Hope is always founded in history, but history always has a purpose.
[time=2533] There are those as historians who like to speculate as to whether there is a dynamic sense to history,
[time=2539] as to whether there is a consciousness within history or behind history that caused events to transpire.
[time=2545] And their love to speculate as to whether history ever repeats itself.
[time=2552] Was there a repetition in history between Lincoln and Kennedy?
[time=2556] Did you know that Lincoln was elected president in 1860 and Kennedy in 1960?
[time=2563] Did you know that each of those men had a son by the same name?
[time=2569] Did you know that each of those men had secretaries, personal secretaries, and Kennedy's personal secretary's name was Lincoln, and Lincoln's personal secretary's name was Kennedy?
[time=2584] And there's been a group of men who have developed a whole series of parallelisms between those two men,
[time=2591] and they ask the question, does history repeat itself?
[time=2594] Is there a dynamic sense that history has purpose?
[time=2598] Could it be that an Indian living in this area over 140 years ago could place a curse on a general by the name of William Henry Harrison?
[time=2610] And that based upon that curse that every president in the United States elected in the year ending in zero would die following William Henry Harrison.
[time=2620] In 1900 we found that to be true.
[time=2625] 1840 William Henry Harrison is elected president of the United States.
[time=2629] He dies 41 days later of pneumonia.
[time=2632] Twenty years later Abraham Lincoln is elected president of the United States in 1860.
[time=2637] He dies by an assassin's bullet at Ford's Theatre.
[time=2641] 1880 James A. Garfield, a Buckeye, is elected president of the United States.
[time=2647] He's shot at a railroad station and he dies 30 days later.
[time=2651] 1900 another Ohio one.
[time=2654] William McKinley is elected president in the middle of his term in Buffalo, New York.
[time=2660] He's standing in a line greeting people and the man comes up to shake his hand with his arm wrapped in the cast.
[time=2665] But inside that cast is a gun and he points at point blank and he kills the president but Kenley is dead.
[time=2672] 1920 Warren G. Harding is elected president.
[time=2676] He dies in office of heart failure, stroke.
[time=2680] 1940 FDR is elected for another term.
[time=2685] That man later becomes re-elected and he dies in office.
[time=2690] 1960 John F. Kennedy is elected president in the middle of his term.
[time=2697] He's assassinated in the city of Dallas.
[time=2700] 1980 Ronald Reagan selected president and the assassin shoots him.
[time=2705] Do you think perhaps that an Indian curse can stand through upon the office of President of the United States?
[time=2711] You want to know the answer?
[time=2713] No.
[time=2714] An Indian can't place a curse upon a man and it caused history to be motivated.
[time=2720] No history does not repeat itself in cycles.
[time=2722] There are coincidence.
[time=2724] There are parallels.
[time=2726] That is not how history finds its purpose.
[time=2728] But history does have a purpose.
[time=2731] And there is a consciousness behind history and the person of God and the history that Paul outlines that Christ died, that Christ was buried, that Christ rose again, that Christ was seen
[time=2743] is a point of history that was developed on the consciousness of God for a purpose.
[time=2749] We find that purpose in verse 3.
[time=2752] That Christ died for our sins.
[time=2757] That the death of Jesus Christ was not simply the will of a mob that would stand outside of palace.
[time=2763] And give us more of us and crucify Christ.
[time=2767] He did not die at the request of men.
[time=2770] Jesus Christ was not crucified by decree of Pilate.
[time=2774] No decree of a human sent him to that cross.
[time=2777] Jesus Christ was not laid on the cross and nailed by the spikes in the hand of a Roman centurion.
[time=2782] Jesus Christ died as the culminating fact and fulfillment of history.
[time=2789] The Bible says in Acts chapter 2 that it was by the foreknowledge and the predetermined counsel of God that Christ came in the world to die for sins.
[time=2799] Because within the justice of God and the holiness of God, he says the soul that sins it shall die.
[time=2807] The wages of sin is death and the God within his holiness and within his character cannot reach down the sinful man with approval, look upon them and bring them unto himself.
[time=2817] Only through the sacrifice of his only beloved son Jesus Christ that he died as a substitute for our sins.
[time=2825] There's a word that has great beauty in the Bible does that little word for.
[time=2829] It means in behalf of or in the place of instead of Christ died for my sins and for yours and the history of life.
[time=2838] The history of the world has a purpose that culminates in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2844] And that was Act 1, scene 1.
[time=2846] Act 2, scene 2, has still had when he brings all of creation under subjection, but he has conquered the first and great enemy death by his resurrection.
[time=2857] Those are the facts of history.
[time=2859] Now based upon those facts, now we can argue hope.
[time=2864] We can have hope today.
[time=2866] Within this chapter we'll give a panoramic view of the hope that Paul issued forth.
[time=2871] The first hope that he gave was that Jesus Christ's resurrection, the fact that he was died, that he buried, that he rose again, that he was seen.
[time=2880] Now is the basis for hope in many ways.
[time=2883] First of all it is our confidence and our proof that Jesus Christ was the Son of God who he claimed to be.
[time=2892] That's found in the little phrase in chapter 15 verses 3 and verses 4 where it says according to the Scriptures.
[time=2900] Because you see Jesus Christ was the Son of God and the Scriptures foretold his death and the Scriptures foretold his resurrection.
[time=2908] Paul was speaking of the prophet David King speaking in Psalm 19 where he said,
[time=2915] "Therefore are Psalm 69, therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my soul shall rest in hope that will not leave my soul and shield.
[time=2927] And neither will thou permit by an holy one to see corruption.
[time=2931] Thou will not let my soul and grave.
[time=2935] Thou will not let thy holy one to see corruption." David was predicting the resurrection that death could not hold him.
[time=2942] And so Peter in Acts chapter 2 sets forth the resurrection as the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy as proof that Jesus Christ was who he said he was.
[time=2953] He was the Son of God.
[time=2955] And because he was God you can trust him this morning.
[time=2959] You can trust his word today.
[time=2961] His promises are true.
[time=2963] He has substantially backed up those promises by the resurrection.
[time=2967] In his own lifetime face to face Christ was asked for a sign.
[time=2971] Some miraculous event that could prove his deity and he said, "No sign shall be given this wicked or adulterous generation except for the sign of the prophet Jonah."
[time=2984] For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so saw I the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and rise again.
[time=2996] Jesus Christ proved his being God by the resurrection.
[time=3001] And now we can trust his word.
[time=3003] We can claim his promises.
[time=3005] He has proven his identity and you can trust him today.
[time=3008] You know it's difficult to trust people today.
[time=3011] I'm always amazed at one particular magazine, US News and World Report.
[time=3016] They always give an article each week.
[time=3019] It's an article what the experts say.
[time=3021] And there's always a bar right down the middle of the page.
[time=3024] And one expert says the economy is getting better.
[time=3026] He's the Republican.
[time=3027] This guy says the economy is getting worse.
[time=3029] He's the Democrat.
[time=3030] They've switched sides when Jimmy Carter was president.
[time=3033] The Democrat said it was getting better and the Republican said it was getting worse.
[time=3036] And here we have two experts telling us about the economy.
[time=3040] An expert number one says it's getting better.
[time=3043] Expert number two says it's getting worse.
[time=3046] What do the experts say?
[time=3048] And can we really trust the experts?
[time=3050] Many of us raised our children according to the teachings of Dr. Spock.
[time=3055] Now Dr. Spock seems to be highly suspect and maybe he's not the expert that we thought he was.
[time=3060] Maybe we should follow Dr. Seuss.
[time=3062] We're looking for an expert, someone that could help us.
[time=3066] But are they trustworthy?
[time=3068] Who can you trust today?
[time=3069] The scientist tells us that evolution is the only rational explanation for the origin of man.
[time=3074] It thrilled my heart this week to see a noted evolutionist.
[time=3078] A man of great intelligence say it can't work.
[time=3082] It can't work.
[time=3084] It doesn't really make it.
[time=3085] There are too many gaps in evolution.
[time=3087] But how can we trust the experts?
[time=3089] We're looking for someone who can speak authoritatively with confidence in Jesus Christ
[time=3095] as the one who can speak and he is the only true and living God.
[time=3099] And him was life and in him is truth.
[time=3101] And you can trust him today that as he is spoken you can claim his promises.
[time=3106] We have hope today because the resurrection proves that Jesus Christ was the Son of God
[time=3112] and that we can trust him.
[time=3115] Secondly, Paul argues later on that we can have confidence and hope today
[time=3121] because the resurrection proves that the death of Jesus Christ paid for our sins.
[time=3129] Read with me as I read aloud, follow silently in verses 17, 18, and 19.
[time=3137] If Christ be not raised, your faith is in vain.
[time=3143] You are yet in your sins, then they also who are dead in Christ are perished,
[time=3149] and we in this life only have hope in Christ.
[time=3153] We are of all men most miserable.
[time=3156] Here's what Paul is saying.
[time=3157] If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then we have preached a lie and you have believed a lie
[time=3165] and worse than that your sins are still upon you and you are dying in sin and those who are already dead are still in their sins and they are suffering in hell because Jesus Christ could not take away their sins if he did not rise from the grave.
[time=3181] The point Paul was saying is that the resurrection of Christ is God's stamp and seal of approval that the death of Christ was sufficient and acceptable to God and that God raised him from the dead as a sign saying that Jesus paid it all.
[time=3198] And if Christ is not raised from the dead, Paul says that we are still in our sins.
[time=3203] Romans 4 chapter 25 says that he was delivered up for our offenses
[time=3210] and that he was raised up for our justification.
[time=3213] The resurrection of Christ is the promise of our justification that God will forgive our sins if we by faith come to Christ.
[time=3222] And so we have hope today that our sins have been forgiven by the work of Christ.
[time=3227] Thirdly he argues that this proves that there is eternal life for the believers.
[time=3233] Return with me if you will, to verse 12.
[time=3236] Paul was argued by what we call deductive thinking.
[time=3240] Deductive thinking argues from the general principle to the specific application.
[time=3245] It's inductive thinking that goes from the specific to a general application.
[time=3249] Deductively Paul says this.
[time=3251] Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, I'll say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead.
[time=3258] Paul was probably thinking of two groups of people.
[time=3261] The Jewish Sadducees who did not believe in the resurrection, angels, supernaturalists, they were the religious naturalists of the day.
[time=3270] They said there is no resurrection.
[time=3273] There was another group of people, not the religious naturalists, the secular naturalists, the Greeks who did not believe in any resurrection, any life after death.
[time=3284] And they were influencing the Church of Corinth.
[time=3286] And now Paul argues this way.
[time=3288] How is it that some of you say there is no resurrection, verse 12?
[time=3292] But if there be no resurrection, then Christ is not raised from the dead.
[time=3296] And if Christ be not raised from the dead, then our preaching is in vain.
[time=3302] What Paul was saying is this.
[time=3304] Is that the physical resurrection of Christ is the proof that there is a resurrection
[time=3311] and that our sins have been forgiven and that we can have hope in eternal life.
[time=3316] Not only that, look at verse 20.
[time=3318] But now is Christ raised from the dead and he has become the first fruits of them that slept.
[time=3323] First fruits means a prototype.
[time=3326] That means he was the first and that we will follow in his pattern.
[time=3330] Just as God raised Jesus Christ from the dead and clothed him with an eternal, celestial body that he will raise all believers from the dead and clothe them in the body and that we shall live forever with him in his kingdom.
[time=3342] And the proof of that is his own resurrection.
[time=3346] Beloved, as I looked out in the auditorium this morning, I see many of you, and we've walked to the grave together.
[time=3353] I've buried some of your parents, buried some of your sons.
[time=3358] And we know the hurt of death.
[time=3361] There is a hurt and there is a mourning because we've lost one that we love from this life.
[time=3366] But the Scripture teaches and we claim the promise that we do not mourn as others mourn.
[time=3372] Why?
[time=3374] We suffer the loss of that loved one but we have confidence that loved ones in heaven that will be united together with them forever and there is eternal life and our hope is built upon the resurrection of Christ.
[time=3385] We are super naturalists.
[time=3388] We are not naturalists this morning and our confidence is in the Word of God and in the resurrection of Christ.
[time=3394] And fourthly Paul argues verses 28 through 34 that Jesus Christ's resurrection
[time=3403] gives to us the proper motivation for living.
[time=3407] He argues that based upon the resurrection of Christ that we therefore walk is obedient to him.
[time=3413] And in Philippians and Ephesians we've already studied that God will give to the believer the same power that raised Christ from the dead.
[time=3420] He will indwell them with that power that they might live for him today and friends the dynamics of life is the dynamic power of Jesus Christ that can live within us.
[time=3431] Four facts of history.
[time=3434] Fact number one Christ died.
[time=3437] Fact number two he was buried.
[time=3441] Fact number three he arose again.
[time=3444] Fact number four he was seen.
[time=3448] Four points of hope his resurrection proves he was God.
[time=3452] His resurrection proves that his payment for our sins was acceptable to God.
[time=3457] Hope number three his resurrection proves that we have eternal life and that we will live in heaven.
[time=3464] And hope number four that he will empower us to live for him today.
[time=3470] Let us pray together.
