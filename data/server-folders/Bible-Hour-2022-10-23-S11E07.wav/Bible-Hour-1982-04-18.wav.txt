[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=150] To the Bible, Amen.
[time=152] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=159] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=170] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=176] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible hour.
[time=187] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=196] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=206] It's also a delight to welcome our many friends who join us each week for the Bible hour.
[time=211] We say a special word of welcome to you, and thank you who've come to join us for our service and those who are joining us in television.
[time=219] We trust that this hour will be an hour of spiritual blessing and encouragement to your life.
[time=224] One of the greatest ways to motivate us in our Christian walk to instill confidence in God and to praise Him is through the ministry of music.
[time=232] Each week our choir sings for us a hymn of praise to God.
[time=236] Today they sing for us, "Behold the empty tomb," pointing to the fact that Jesus Christ bodily arose from the grave and that God viewed His death for our sins as acceptable.
[time=247] We have been forgiven in Him.
[time=249] And it's our privilege and pleasure today to hear the great anthem sung, "Behold the empty tomb."

[time=2314] have within our psychological makeup a great feeling of inadequacy when we deal
[time=2321] with the unknown and the uncontrollable. I like to feel that I'm in control of my
[time=2328] family's future that I as the male chauvinist dominant arrogant personality I'm in control and I'll always be able to provide for my family because I am so capable and therefore my security in savings not only makes me secure about
[time=2343] the future but that makes me feel adequate within myself. The word of God
[time=2349] is teaching that adequacy does not come within self but adequacy and sufficiency comes through trusting God. Now I love the living Bibles paraphrase.
[time=2359] The living Bible is a paraphrase it's not a translation. Ken Taylor simply desired
[time=2365] to make the word understandable to his children became the fastest and most popular selling of Bible in the last ten years but the living Bible translates this accurately this way. Don't worry about anything instead pray about everything.
[time=2382] We worry when we worry about the things that we don't know we forget the character
[time=2389] of God because the very characteristic of God is that he is omniscient that means that God is all knowing although I do not know what is going to happen in the future I know God and I know that he does and he not only knows it but secondly
[time=2405] God is omnipotent that means he is in control therefore I do not have to worry about the unknown nor do I have to worry about the uncontrollable because God is in control and God does know therefore if I know him and I follow him I don't
[time=2420] need to worry I can trust him I can trust him. There's a story told about a young lady by the name of Nancy who was a servant and she made her living at a very meager level by working in different houses as a house servant and she had a
[time=2436] very joyful countenance about her and always a sense of carefreeness and this
[time=2443] was much to the anxiety of one of the ladies that she worked for and even was a little bothersome to her and in an inquiry the lady said Nancy why don't you
[time=2453] deal with life more honestly you're always so joyful suppose that I couldn't
[time=2460] fall forward to hire you anymore then what would you do or suppose that the other people that you work for couldn't hire you or suppose that some of your children became sick and you had to stay home and take care of them or suppose that you became ill and you couldn't work anymore then what would you do suppose those things happen and Nancy said that's your problem you're always worrying about them supposence know so many times in life we worry about them
[time=2488] supposence what if I get sick and I can't work what if the economy gets work what
[time=2495] if my stock investments aren't secure what if and God says that we're to trust
[time=2501] him for the unknown and the uncontrollable that is his character that is his domain he begins to issue forth based upon that problem a prescription I
[time=2512] love little words in the Bible they're important it says however but instead
[time=2520] of in place of worry pray that little word but reminds me of what I was taught
[time=2526] is the principle of positive replacement that means whenever there's a negative in your life you try to replace that negative with a positive let me give you an illustration some of you are trying to just lose a little way summer's coming clothing styles become just a little tighter you've got a family vacation plan to the beach and you don't want the lifeguard yelling well on the beach or anything else like that that's what the every year I took the kids to
[time=2554] Florida I'd walk out in the beach and they'd start well on the beach you know I'd just like to lose just a few pounds there's a slight problem I'll be sitting at home and maybe I'll be watching TV or I'll just be sitting around talking with some member of the family and without even thinking impulse takes over and I move up out of the chair right over the refrigerator and there I am with my my little spoon you know I'm I'm not gonna eat anything I'm just gonna take a little bit of this I'm not gonna eat the whole piece I'm just gonna take a little bit of this pie I'm just gonna have a handful pretzels and a handful pretzels mean that you have to have a little bit of Pepsi but a little bit of Pepsi and you have too much Pepsi then you know so you have a little bit more pretzels to finish off the Pepsi you know there's this effort to try to control what you
[time=2597] eat and the only way you're gonna learn to control that is through a principal positive replacement now what I've done in my life in a few instances is I've said all right every time I get this impulse to eat I'm going to stop and I'm gonna do 25 sit-ups that way instead of adding inches I'm somewhat working at
[time=2615] losing those inches and then it has a Pavlovian effect that every time your mind says let's get something to eat your stomach says I don't want to do any push-ups that's called the principle of positive replacement you know what God is saying that every time this little natural human instant takes over that
[time=2634] says worry fret panic what if supposing that just allow that to be a divinely
[time=2641] placed alarm clock that simply says that it's time to pray and commit that particular anxiety to God instead of worrying about everything pray about
[time=2652] everything and the prescription for worry is prayer because prayer says God
[time=2658] I've got a burden and I can't deal with it therefore I'm going to give it to you and I'll trust you to care for it worry says I can't deal with it and I better panic because I am alone so the prescription is to pray as a matter of fact
[time=2673] it's repeatedly given it says pray with supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God he's saying it in a redundant way that tell God what you need but it's important in how you tell him it says that we are to
[time=2690] pray with thanksgiving it's so important that we begin each time of prayer with
[time=2696] thanksgiving for at least two reasons the first one is that it guards against an ungrateful unthankful heart God says that one of the descriptions in the
[time=2707] descent of mankind in Romans one is that they were unthankful they were ungrateful and to learn to say thank you is a quality of life that should be
[time=2717] evident and transparent and each believer Rachel is two years old and there are some ladies in our church who have taken a special love and care for her and she loves those people but she's discovered that most of those ladies have a purse and inside their purse there is either gum or mints or maybe
[time=2737] better than yet candy and she's got him figured out as to who carries gum and candy and she'll run down the hall and they'll bend down to hug her and kiss her and she'll come running and they're expecting a little hug and kiss and she stops dead and says where's your purse you know you think oh my god you know how am I gonna teach this kid some form of civilization so she's more like her mother and less like me and you're just a just hello please I thank you in life with just make it so much more
[time=2767] bearable you know that's not only true of a two-year-old that's so true of our lives as adults that we forget to say thank you and we become ungrateful and
[time=2777] unappreciative and that becomes a stigma in our lives but there's another reason
[time=2783] to pray with thanksgiving because when you stop to thank God for the good things
[time=2789] that he's done you rehearse for yourself history that teaches you you can trust God on Wednesday night we studied the history of Israel as they came to the oasis of Mara in Exodus and we remember that these people came and as soon as
[time=2805] they walked three days in the wilderness and they were hot and they were thirsty they came to an oasis and when they tasted the water it was bitter and they said oh God did you bring us out here to die where if they would have been thankful and if they were to remember history they could have said oh God thank you that when we were in Egypt that you provided a way of escape father thank
[time=2827] you that as you curse the nation of Egypt with ten hideous plagues that you discriminally spare us that our firstborn did not die that our cattle did not die
[time=2837] thank you Lord that our water was preserved in its pots and it did not turn to blood and they could have said oh God we remember walking in that wilderness and you provided a cloud at night at day in a pillar fire by night and God you've directed us thank you Lord and then to say Lord we remember as
[time=2857] we came to the Red Sea and we look back in the might of the military power of Egypt was coming down upon us God you opened the Red Sea and you delivered us oh God thank you you know I'm confident if they would have prayed those prayers of thanksgiving while they had their knees in the water of Mars they would have said no God because we thank you for these things and we've seen your faithfulness Father we trust you to provide water for us the water is bitter Lord and we need a fresh water oh God provide for us because you're faithful you see if they would have just remembered to say thank you for what God had done that would have changed their perspective instead of been a bitter people they would have been a confident people and if you want an antidote for your anxieties and your worries then rehearse the faithfulness of God in your life and thank you for what he's done don't worry about anything instead pray
[time=2913] about everything about everything you know there is an arrogance about us
[time=2919] there's an arrogance that says I've got to trust God for many problems but I can
[time=2925] handle these I can handle these just remember it is the little fox that eats
[time=2933] the vine are the little things that often add up to the big problems and it's
[time=2939] important that we not say I can handle these but instead we trust God for every
[time=2947] decision in life that he has that authority and that control in our being
[time=2954] that we pray with thanksgiving and that we pray about everything and then thirdly
[time=2961] that we pray specifically the word supplication stands as a clarification
[time=2968] of prayer supplication means a particular request it means like a man
[time=2975] who goes and he stands before a king or a president to make a request known now suppose you were given an audience with president Ronald Reagan and you had a very particular request upon your heart there were things that you wanted you would not go stand before Ronald Reagan and in the busyness of his schedule and in the importance of his position and you would say all Ronald Reagan president United States how thankful I am that you are president United States and I bring before you all the needs of my life thank you for this time it's been good to talk with you and leave if you were going to meet that man and you had a specific need you would tell him the need now God is omniscient he knows those need but he says to tell him your need and there is the antidote for
[time=3022] anxiety to pray with thanksgiving specifically about everything and if
[time=3029] you'll do that God says that there is a promise for you to keep for 7 and the
[time=3036] peace of God which passes or surpasses all your ability to comprehend shall
[time=3045] keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus that God gives this promise beloved that when we apply his antidote of prayer that he supplies a
[time=3056] promised answer that he will give to us peace contentment so often we don't
[time=3063] understand that God answers prayer according to his will and many times we
[time=3070] pray for a particular object or we pray for a particular outcome but what we should do is we should precede our prayer with a devotion and a commitment to his will and then what he does is he supplies for us our need he will either
[time=3085] supply for us the exact request that we've asked for or he will supply to us the peace the contentment to live in that situation it is a promise and it is a
[time=3097] peace that will surpass all of our understanding I cannot explain to you how
[time=3103] poly carp of Ephesus bound-handed foot standing in the arena with caged lions
[time=3110] ready to devour him could answer the governor the governor said swear by
[time=3116] Caesar and you'll live and poly carp would refuse to swear by Caesar and he
[time=3122] would give testimony of Christ I cannot explain that peace that he had and then because he would defy the animals then the governor would say do you defy the fire also and he said I fear not the fire that burns for an hour but you
[time=3138] should fear the fire of hell that burns for eternity and with peace he accepted death cannot explain that I cannot explain how a Cory 10 boom can live with
[time=3149] confidence through the persecution and the imprisonment of a concentration camp under the Nazis now she can come out in prayer and concern for the spiritual well-being of those guards I cannot explain it cannot explain the confidence
[time=3165] that God can give to your life it goes beyond my ability to understand what the
[time=3172] passage you're saying is that God will give us a piece and that he'll work in the problem in a way that will far exceed our calculations because God
[time=3181] understandings our mind says I know you're standing there thinking what if and you calculate if this happens then I'll do this and if this happens then I'll do that and we've calculated our own little plan out and God says I'll give you a peace that will far exceed any peace that you can develop by your own calculations when Jesus announced his death to his disciples he knew that they
[time=3204] would be fearful he knew that they would be filled with anxiety but he said peace I leave with you my peace give I unto you not as the world gives let your
[time=3215] heart be not troubled neither let it be afraid God is the God of peace Jesus
[time=3222] Christ was called the Prince of peace Isaiah the prophet said these words that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee the promises if you by prayer put your trust in God that he
[time=3238] will give you peace throughout the Psalms it tells us to cast our care upon
[time=3244] the Lord and so often we think of the word cast means I pick up a relatively small weight and I throw it out and we think of a fisherman casting a line but
[time=3254] that word really doesn't mean to pick up and throw it means a burden that is so big that it cannot be picked up and so the word actually means to roll your burden over and God said through prayer when we roll our burden over unto him that he'll give us the sustaining peace for life a piece that passes our human
[time=3273] ability and that peace then will in effect keep our heart that word keep
[time=3279] means to secure or to fortify it's a military term as you can picture a city with strong walls about it and on top of those walls marching day and night our soldiers guard and garrisoning the fort as sentinels marching back and forth
[time=3295] God says that is peace in Jesus Christ guards and garrisons our heart and keeps not only our heart secure but our very thoughts our mind there is the promise
[time=3306] of God that when we apply his prescription there is healing there is health to trust him today would you be the recipient of the peace of God before
[time=3318] you can receive the peace of God you must receive peace with God peace with
[time=3324] God where you see man in his natural state women in their natural state do not have peace with God as a matter of fact the Bible describes us in Romans the
[time=3335] fifth chapter in three ways it says first of all that we were unlovely secondly that we were sinners and thirdly that we were the enemies of God
[time=3347] because of the sinful nature of our heart we stand and rebellion to him and therefore there is no peace with God but there is peace with God available that Jesus Christ died for our sins for ungodliness our loveliness for our sins that he might take upon himself the enmity the enemy relationship that we
[time=3369] have with God and our sins can be forgiven and therefore there can become a new relationship of peace with God before you can never know the peace of God you
[time=3380] must have the peace with God that comes when you by faith receive Jesus Christ and do your heart as Savior a problem anxiety worry a prescription to trust
[time=3398] him to pray with thanksgiving a promise peace of God but do you have most of
[time=3406] all peace first of all with God let us pray together
[time=3413] this morning to speak of peace is the speak of a popular word each of us
[time=3419] wants peace around the world each of us wants peace within our home each of us wants peace within our personal lives there's only through Jesus Christ that this world will ever know peace when he comes again he sets up his kingdom of peace it's only when we as family members are committed to him and united in him that there'll be peace in our families the only way we'll ever know personal peace is know Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior that is an act of faith where
[time=3450] you open up your heart and say Lord Jesus I believe you did die for my sins I
[time=3456] invite you into my heart as Savior today you must make a personal decision we
[time=3464] try to live in your own adequacy will you try to deal with your anxieties by your own calculations in life are we you today say God I'll roll the burden of my
[time=3473] life over to you I'll accept your prescription I'll commit not only my personal promise to you but I'll commit my eternal destiny of heaven to you through prayer I will receive Christ if you'll do that then the promises are yours peace
[time=3490] with God and the peace of God it's your decision I cannot make it for you it's a
[time=3496] decision between you and God but you can make it today you can make it right now if you will simply open up the door of your heart by faith and ask Jesus Christ to come in I pray that you will you've been sharing the word of God with pastor Rick Hawks here in the

[time=3558] believing to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation and thank you the the word of God tells me that I am saved I pray in Jesus name amen my friends if you've
