[time=27] Welcome to the Bible Hour. Each week Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=36] They're preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=48] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=53] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=64] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=73] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=84] And we rejoice in the fact that we have opportunity to praise our God.
[time=88] Not only do we have an opportunity here in this auditorium, but each week we're able to share the ministry of music and the Word of God with thousands of people through the ministry of television.
[time=99] And at this time we say a special word of welcome to our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=105] Today we have a special group with us who will be ministering to us in music.
[time=109] They come to us from Columbus, Ohio, the Worthington, Grace, Brother, and Church, Corral.
[time=115] They're under the direction of Mr. Randy Kettering, and today they're going to minister to us in music.
[time=120] Four or five songs that I know will bring praise to God, but will also encourage and lift your heart.
[time=126] They're under the direction of Mr. Randy Kettering, the Worthington, Grace, Brother, Corral.
[time=156] [MUSIC - 290 seconds]
[time=474] Hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=477] Don, I want to welcome you back too.
[time=479] I missed you last week, and I'm sure that many of our friends missed you as you were in New York last week.
[time=484] Tell us a little bit about your trip.
[time=486] Brother and I usually get together in the spring and in the fall for evangelistic meetings, since that's what we did for a great deal of our lives, and we were in a little town called Lockport, New York.
[time=498] At a tremendous meeting, people were saved there, and, you know, Rick, it's really interesting, no matter where you are, we have a message to share, and it's the message of the Word of God, which is so important.
[time=508] So we share the Word of God here on television, we share the Word of God there in Lockport, we had a good time sharing.
[time=514] Don, I'm encouraged to hear that, and the Word of God is our purpose for being with these friends today.
[time=520] We want you to know that this is a ministry of the Bible and teaching and proclaiming through music and spoken Word,
[time=528] the message that God has revealed.
[time=530] About four years ago, Don, we were not called the Bible Hour, this particular broadcast was called the Heritage Hour,
[time=537] but we changed it to the Bible Hour because we wanted to communicate to people exactly what the purpose is,
[time=543] and that is proclaiming God's Word to people, people who don't have another avenue of hearing the message.
[time=550] Rick, there's a letter that a fine person sent in concerning their feeling of the Bible Hour.
[time=557] They listened on Easter Sunday, this is what they say.
[time=559] Easter Sunday, I had the great fortune of watching and hearing your sermon, talking to Pastor Rick, this was addressed to you.
[time=566] Since I'm a brand new member of God's family and being so overwhelmed by the message in your sermon,
[time=573] I would like to have a copy of it on cassette.
[time=575] This program was 10, 23, so that I may study and use it to aid me and encourage me in my newborn faith.
[time=582] I think that letter is tremendous, Rick.
[time=584] Well, I'm certainly thankful for that letter and want to give all the praise and the credit to God and to the power of His Word.
[time=591] But that's exactly what the Bible Hour is designed to do to help people understand God's Word.
[time=597] Here's a person who's a brand new Christian.
[time=599] What we want to do is send them that tape to help them study God's Word, but also perhaps to suggest a couple of good churches that they could become a part of so that they become a growing part of the family of God.
[time=612] The Bible is our message, and that is why we are sharing with you this edition of the Bible,
[time=618] the new international version.
[time=620] The advantage of this particular Bible is that it is very readable.
[time=625] Perhaps from time to time you struggle with some of the language of the King James Bible.
[time=630] We use it here in the Bible Hour, but sometimes it is difficult to understand the language that was four or five hundred years old,
[time=639] and this Bible will help you to understand God's Word today.
[time=643] It's accurate and it's readable.
[time=645] We'd like to send it to you if you can join us in bearing the cost of this ministry.
[time=651] If you can send us a gift of twenty-five dollars or more, we want to send you this Bible as our thank you.
[time=657] Along with this, we have other literature that we want to share with you.
[time=661] But if you'd like to write to us today, write to the Bible Hour, box fifteen thousand, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=668] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=672] Along with the copy of the NIV, we'd like to also send you a guide that will help you in your study of the Word of God.
[time=680] We've been offering timeless insights.
[time=682] It's a tremendous little devotional book and a great help.
[time=685] I've enjoyed it myself and we have devotions for every month.
[time=689] We'd like to send you your May issue just as soon as possible.
[time=692] What it does is it gives you a scripture verse and then it tells you some explanation of the scripture verse,
[time=698] and then it gives a description by some great man of God who's lived before, some hero of the faith,
[time=705] men like Calvin, men like Murray, great man of God who lived before us and we have respect for.
[time=714] It gives a little idea of what they feel that verse means.
[time=718] We want to send you your copy of timeless insights.
[time=721] Please send to the Bible Hour, that's the Bible Hour, box fifteen thousand, one, five, zero, zero, zero,
[time=729] Fort Wayne, Indiana, four, six, eight, one, five, and we'll send you your copy right away.
[time=736] Tom, in just a moment we're going to be rejoining the worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church,
[time=742] and what should our viewers look for in the music?
[time=745] Well, we've been enjoying the ministry of the Grace Brethren Church chorale from Columbus, Ohio,
[time=751] and we're going to listen to them again.
[time=753] In just a few minutes they're going to sing a song that their director, Randy Kettering, wrote a beautiful, beautiful song that's called Compassion.
[time=762] And then the fellow that manages the group, Stan Hedges, is going to sing a solo for us, so we're in for some more good music.
[time=769] Well, I always look forward to the ministry of that music, and it lifts my own heart and prepares me to share God's Word with you.
[time=776] And thank you for joining us today, and I trust that the rest of this hour will be a real encouragement to your heart.

[time=1296] (light music) - Thank you, Stan.
[time=1304] That song ministered to our hearts today.
[time=1307] It is well with my soul.
[time=1309] Written by H.G. Spafford, as he looked down into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, that had swallowed up his four lovely daughters and taken them to heaven.
[time=1319] And in the storms and the seas of life, he had learned contentment.
[time=1323] That to say, no matter what God had done, no matter what God had brought into his life, that it is well with my soul.
[time=1331] Perhaps there could not be a greater introduction to our study today of God's word from Philippians the fourth chapter in verses 11, 12, and 13.
[time=1341] You may recall, we started back in August of 1981 studying the book of Philippians.
[time=1349] Today we come to our last study.
[time=1351] For some of us, it's been an opportunity to in-depth study the word of God in a way that we've never before.
[time=1358] For others of us, it's been an opportunity to discover some insight into the life of the Apostle Paul and into a particular church.
[time=1367] And I trust for all of us, it's been a time when we've heard the word of God, and understand that it makes direction and claims upon our lives today.
[time=1376] Paul, the Apostle writing to the Church of Philippi I'll read for you and encourage you to follow along silently in your Bible, verse 11 of chapter four.
[time=1390] Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatever state I am in this to be content.
[time=1402] I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound.
[time=1409] Everywhere, and in all things, I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
[time=1423] I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[time=1429] Let us pray together.
[time=1431] Our Father, we bow before you in our heart to ask you to speak to us today through your word.
[time=1440] That you would take your living word and cause it to divide our heart, to examine us, to dissect us, to know our inner being, our thoughts, our intentions, our desires and appetites.
[time=1453] God, we ask that you would take your word and apply it as a soothing balm and a healing upon the broken hearts that would be here today, for those that know the loss of a loved one, for those that know the trying circumstances of life and the pressures of finances that never seem to be enough, Father, we pray that there would be comfort and encouragement in your word.
[time=1475] Father, we also pray for those today who come with a full heart, that there would be a challenge and an extensive excitement and anticipation.
[time=1483] As we study your word, our lives would be directed, refreshed, made anew.
[time=1489] As a pastor, Father, I pray that you would take your word and apply it to each heart.
[time=1494] To use me, although I'm unfit, to make your word come alive, to make it clear, to make application, or it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=1506] There is a very familiar and old adage that goes something like this, or give to me the strength to change the things that I can, the grace to accept the things that I cannot and the wisdom to know the difference.
[time=1522] Perhaps the man who first came up with those lines was familiar with what Paul had said here in this fourth chapter of Philippians.
[time=1532] God give to me the strength to change the things that I can't, the grace to accept the things that I cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference.
[time=1542] That is a cart that is at peace and content, that is willing to labor, but is also willing to accept.
[time=1550] In this study of the book of Philippians, I'd like to give you a panoramic view, if I could.
[time=1556] Perhaps the chief theme was the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1560] But in application to that theme, we would say that it is the joy of the Lord, some 17 or 18 times in these few verses of 100 plus verses.
[time=1571] Paul has encouraged them to either be joyful or to be full of joy or to rejoice.
[time=1577] At one point he said, "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice." That would be the theme.
[time=1584] The amazing thing about that theme is that it's not coming from someone who is sitting in a rather comfortable apartment writing books on a positive mental attitude.
[time=1595] Living in affluence and abundance saying, "I made it to the top because I was a positive thinker, and if you'll just join me in the positive thinking school, life will be better." It comes from a pen that was held in the hand that was shackled to a Roman soldier.
[time=1612] In chapter 1 Paul said, "I, the prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ, in bonds for you." The little word bond refers to that which we would describe today as a handcuff.
[time=1624] Paul was handcuffed to a Roman soldier.
[time=1627] He was in prison.
[time=1628] His life was on trial.
[time=1630] As a matter of fact it was after his final imprisonment at Rome that his life was indeed taken for the cause of Christ.
[time=1637] He was a man who had been beaten many times, a man who had lost dignity as crowds would stand and mock him and cheer him.
[time=1646] He was a man who knew the trauma and the tragedies of life, having been shipwrecked at sea.
[time=1651] He was a man who knew the hatred of other men who would take him outside the city of Lystra and stone him until they thought he was dead.
[time=1659] But from such a battered life comes a message of triumph and of rejoicing.
[time=1665] In Philippians chapter 1 up through verse 26 Paul speaks about his own life.
[time=1672] Then in verse 27 of chapter 1 all the way through the epistle to chapter 4 verse 9
[time=1678] Paul changes the focus from himself to those people of Philippi to give to them instruction.
[time=1685] Then in chapter 4 verse 10 through the rest of the chapter he makes his own life the subject of his epistle once again.
[time=1693] That was not like Paul to brag about himself or to announce his own accomplishments and that's not what he's primarily doing here.
[time=1702] He's simply saying by illustration what I've been teaching you I am learning and I have learned in my own life.
[time=1709] So as we study these verses we'll discover that Paul has a brief outline for us for statements about himself each beginning with the word I.
[time=1719] He said in verse 11 not that I speak in respect of what for I have learned
[time=1725] whatever state I am in therein to be content.
[time=1728] Paul's first point was this I have learned contentment.
[time=1733] Contentment is the attitude of confidence and acceptance of a particular circumstances
[time=1739] regardless of whether we view them as positive or negative to be content says God when peace like a river attends my way are when sorrows like sea billows roll whatever my lot.
[time=1752] Now it's taught me to say it is well.
[time=1756] It is well with my soul contentment.
[time=1760] But Paul begins by saying I have learned.
[time=1764] You know contentment is a value and a characteristic that we must learn.
[time=1768] It does not come by nature.
[time=1770] You and I as human beings are not content people.
[time=1774] We are people with appetites and desires and those appetites are forever growing and increasing and contentment is contrary to the very basic nature of humanity.
[time=1785] Therefore if we are to be content it is to be learned.
[time=1789] It is to be learned with agony.
[time=1791] It is to be learned with great struggle and great discipline.
[time=1795] Learned as a skill would be learned.
[time=1798] I would like it to learning to swim.
[time=1800] I know many of you have taken your children to learn to swim or perhaps you have learned to swim yourself.
[time=1806] Learning to swim was a very agonizing experience for me.
[time=1810] The agony began when my mother took me to the location of my swimming lessons.
[time=1815] The YWCA.
[time=1820] I was humiliated.
[time=1822] I was six years old and I knew how my friends would laugh.
[time=1827] How could she do that to me?
[time=1830] They had to push me in that door because right on them they do not have men's locker rooms at the YW.
[time=1836] She pushed me and I would go in there.
[time=1838] Then she would have to go around to the pool side door and stream and holler to.
[time=1841] I did not want to take those lessons.
[time=1844] Not only that, I already knew how to swim.
[time=1847] I thought because my dad had taken me to Florida when I was little.
[time=1850] I would dive off the diving board and I would swim under one of the other end and I would come up where I could stand.
[time=1855] I would swim and they wanted me to swim on top of the water.
[time=1858] I did not like that.
[time=1859] Worse than that, I had seen Tarzan swim.
[time=1863] Tarzan only swam with his head up and I was going to be like Tarzan swim with my head up and they wanted me to put my face in the water.
[time=1869] They wanted me to breathe by turning my head to the side.
[time=1872] They actually took my head and they pushed it.
[time=1875] I did not want it pushed in that water.
[time=1877] I did not want to be there.
[time=1878] I did not want to take swimming lessons.
[time=1879] I did not want to do it there and I did not want them pushing me in the water.
[time=1884] You know, many times that is how we learn contentment in life.
[time=1889] God puts a trial, a circumstance right in front of us and we say I do not want to go in there, Lord.
[time=1894] That says why WCA and I go to the YMC and God pushes us through that door.
[time=1900] When we get in that door, we do not like it.
[time=1902] Then in those circumstance of life, it seems as though God himself has taken our little head and he is pushing it into the water of life.
[time=1909] The water comes up in our eyes and in our nose and it tastes funny.
[time=1913] It is uncomfortable and God said I am going to teach you to live and to breathe a new way and he begins to adjust and to turn our head.
[time=1921] To learn to swim is not an easy process.
[time=1924] There is a great deal of fear in learning to swim.
[time=1927] There is a great deal of resentment in the circumstances in which we are placed.
[time=1932] And the learning of contentment is much like learning to swim.
[time=1937] I learned, I learned well.
[time=1940] I entered into competitive swimming and I was a freestyle.
[time=1943] I was sprinting and I could sprint down the pool and do a flip turn, come back.
[time=1947] I was so proud of my accomplishment.
[time=1949] I learned to swim.
[time=1951] We came to a particular swim meet.
[time=1953] Our coach said we were short some swimmers.
[time=1955] We had a lot of freestyles.
[time=1957] That is what I was, but we need someone who could swim butterfly.
[time=1960] He said, "Hocks, you are going to do that." I share with you that there are 55 people in that race and that I came in 55th.
[time=1967] I could not swim butterfly.
[time=1969] For all my life they had told me they were going to stick my head in.
[time=1972] They are going to turn it this way and I would breathe and you do not bleed like that.
[time=1975] But if I you breathe just like Tarzan does and I said, "I could do that when I was six." I told you all along.
[time=1980] I had to learn things all over again.
[time=1982] I thought I had learned to live in the swimming pool and I had learned to succeed.
[time=1986] Then someone comes in and says, "No, you have to do it all different." I had to learn again.
[time=1991] Contentment in life is much like that.
[time=1994] We learned a lesson.
[time=1995] Men and women, this verb, I will give you a little lesson in grammar.
[time=1998] It is not a verb that says, "I have learned it and it is all behind me." It says, "I have learned it and I am still living to learn it." I am still living and learning and I am still living and learning.
[time=2008] Paul knew what it was like to get up in the morning and not be completely pleased with yourself.
[time=2014] To look in the mirror and say, "I know who I am and I am not what I ought to be." But I am learning and Paul said, "I am learning in every situation." To therein, to be content.
[time=2027] I am learning.
[time=2029] Contentment is a difficult thing to learn.
[time=2031] It does not come by nature, as I explained earlier.
[time=2034] Contentment means to have one's appetites under control.
[time=2039] It means the ability to accept the circumstances around you.
[time=2043] It means to have within your self-confidence the ability to say, "Although everything around me may change within myself, I am sufficient and I am content where I am."
[time=2055] Appetites under control.
[time=2058] You know, we are by human nature people of appetites.
[time=2061] We have an appetite for food.
[time=2063] We have an appetite, a desire for air, and a need.
[time=2071] We have a desire for clothing and it can become an appetite beyond that.
[time=2075] We have an appetite for success and for self-actualization, for goal achievement, for appreciation.
[time=2081] They are all appetites.
[time=2083] But contentment means that our appetites are under control.
[time=2089] Let me give you an important lesson in this.
[time=2093] That an appetite is never completely satisfied.
[time=2098] It only increases.
[time=2101] Let me illustrate that from the common experience that you and I all have.
[time=2111] I am sure that on Thanksgiving day or Christmas day or sometime when your family got together,
[time=2117] you had a feast and you over ate to put it mildly.
[time=2122] And as you over ate, you made this statement.
[time=2125] I'll never eat again.
[time=2127] Many of you said that I'll never eat it, did you?
[time=2131] You sure did.
[time=2132] There is a common expression rather earthly, but I'll share it with you that is common today in describing over eating.
[time=2138] It's called "Pigging Out." I remember as a seminary student going to a really nice little ice cream stand called the flagpole.
[time=2147] And they had all kinds of banana splits.
[time=2150] There was a single dip.
[time=2152] There was a double dip.
[time=2153] And then they had a four dip banana split.
[time=2156] It was delicious.
[time=2157] And they gave it an appropriate name.
[time=2159] It was called a "Pig's Dinner." And they came in a little cardboard serving tray and all around it were these little pigs running by.
[time=2167] And it kind of had a guilt complex as you ate that "Pig's Dinner." I can remember eating those four stoops of ice cream and it going down.
[time=2175] And I said, oh, so far I'll never eat one of these again until tomorrow.
[time=2180] Now here's what happens when you over eat.
[time=2183] You start off with a stomach about this size and it has an appetite to be filled.
[time=2188] And when you over eat, you get this full filling, you say, oh, I'll never need to do that again.
[time=2193] But what happens is when you over eat, you stretch your stomach this big.
[time=2197] And about 14 hours later, that food's all digested.
[time=2200] Now you're hungrier than you were before you ate that.
[time=2203] And so you fill up that larger stretched out muscle, elastic stomach, and you pack it in there again and you stretch it out.
[time=2211] And you get hungrier than you ever were and you stretch that stomach out.
[time=2216] And some of you've got the evidence on your belt. There's a warm spot.
[time=2220] But that warm spot keeps moving further and further to the edge of the belt.
[time=2224] Why is that?
[time=2226] It's because an appetite is never permanently satisfied.
[time=2231] As a matter of fact, when you satisfy an appetite, you usually ultimately increase it.
[time=2239] And Paul was saying here that God tells us that we are to learn to control our appetites.
[time=2247] Now we talked primarily about food, but you know that that appetite can increase in many, many ways.
[time=2253] You can have an appetite for clothing.
[time=2257] Some of you may have grown up in a rather poor family.
[time=2261] And you felt like everything that you owned was a hand me down.
[time=2264] And when you have four older brothers and you're the fifth in a row, they come down a little bit worn.
[time=2270] And you're always a little embarrassed. That's what your clothing looked like.
[time=2274] And therefore you now have an appetite for clothing, not just for yourself, but you've determined that your children are never going to grow up like you grew up.
[time=2283] They're going to have nice clothes. They're not going to have early American garage sale.
[time=2287] They're going to have good clothes and nice clothing. And you have an appetite for clothing.
[time=2293] You know, I reached a point where some suits went on sale $50 for a new wool suit.
[time=2299] And I bought two new wool suits and I lined up and I said, "Look at all those suits." And I said, "I'll never need to buy suits again." I got up this morning and said, "Boy, I'd like to have a new summer suit." Something happened to mine over the winter.
[time=2311] You hang things up for a lengthy print and they shrink.
[time=2314] And so I'm saying, "I need a new suit now." That's an appetite.
[time=2318] And I thought there was a point where that was satisfied.
[time=2320] My need, it's satisfied. And now my appetite comes back.
[time=2324] That's not a neat appetite. That's a one appetite from being stretched.
[time=2328] Some of you have an appetite for prominence.
[time=2331] You grew up. And as you grew up, your father was not really respected in the community.
[time=2338] And you weren't pleased with the type of employment that your father had.
[time=2342] And you were not quite as proud as the little guy down the street who could brag that his father had this particular employment.
[time=2348] And you were always a little embarrassed to mention what your father did.
[time=2351] And so therefore you now have an appetite that you will have prominence.
[time=2356] And you're on a course and a trail and a ladder for prominence in your vocation.
[time=2361] And that's an appetite.
[time=2363] And you said, "If I can just achieve this particular level, then I'll be satisfied." I cannot tell you what will happen when you achieve that level.
[time=2372] You will be satisfied, just like you're satisfied with a meal.
[time=2376] But it won't be soon until you're standing at that plateau.
[time=2379] And you're looking to say, "If I could just achieve one more plateau." And when you get there, it's one more plateau.
[time=2386] It's an appetite for self-actualization.
[time=2389] An appetite that says, "I need to be wanted. I need to be appreciated." And it goes, and it goes, and it goes.
[time=2395] There are those that start off in a house, and that's a cute little house.
[time=2399] And they say, "This house will meet our needs." And they decide, "Well, maybe they can afford a little bigger house." And it would be nice to have a basement and a toy room for the truck.
[time=2407] And the house gets a little bigger.
[time=2409] And then that house just seems like that would be adequate forever.
[time=2412] But the appetite grows, and it grows, and it grows.
[time=2416] You see, appetites are never completely satisfied, only temporarily satisfied.
[time=2422] And in their satisfaction, they grow.
[time=2425] And it takes discipline, and it takes effort to reorientate our lives to decrease our appetites.
[time=2435] There are physical points in our life with food that we can eat anything.
[time=2439] I remember being a teenager, and even into my early school, I could eat anything, and I guess the chewing, I chewed so fast that it worked it off.
[time=2447] But somewhere around 27 years old, changes began to happen.
[time=2451] And whatever I ate began to show up.
[time=2454] And I remember looking and wondering why my body would begin to gain weight.
[time=2462] And I discovered that I was putting in more than I needed.
[time=2467] And that my body expected me to keep putting in at that rate because I had created not a physical need,
[time=2475] but an appetite.
[time=2477] And it takes great discipline to reorient your body to saying, I only need this much.
[time=2483] And this much is not only what I need, but more than that is harmful to my body.
[time=2490] I'm still learning that lesson, control of an appetite.
[time=2495] Paul said, not that I speak in respect of one, he said, I'm not struggling, not pleading for sympathy,
[time=2502] but he said, I've learned in whatever state I'm in, in this to be content.
[time=2510] He said that my appetite is under control.
[time=2514] Contentment is the exact opposite of lust.
[time=2518] Lust is appetite out of control, contentment is appetite under control.
[time=2524] Paul said, I've learned to control my appetite.
[time=2528] Secondly, he said, verse 12, not only have I learned, but I know something.
[time=2533] I know how to be a based, and I know how to abound.
[time=2539] Now here are two various lifestyles, and perhaps they represent this body of people.
[time=2546] There are those today that they do know how to live a based with very little, with only a subsistence lifestyle,
[time=2554] a hand-to-mouth type of existence.
[time=2557] There are also those today that know the abundance of the blessing of God.
[time=2561] Financial, prosperity, and great affluence.
[time=2565] Paul said, I know how to live in both.
[time=2569] Paul knew what it meant to live in a based type lifestyle.
[time=2573] He knew what it meant to have nothing in the way of a possession.
[time=2577] Paul knew that as he went from place to place, that he had to earn his own way, that there was no provision of support that would come in.
[time=2585] And so he would be a tent maker, and he would make things with his hands, and he would sell them, and that would supply his need, and he lived hand-to-mouth.
[time=2593] Paul knew what it was to live a based.
[time=2596] He also knew what it meant to live without a great deal of dignity.
[time=2600] Each of us has a need, emotionally, for a sense of appreciation, self-worth, and that we are positively being received by others.
[time=2610] Paul knew the emotional abasement of loss of dignity.
[time=2614] Paul knew what it was like to have his clothes stripped off and in nakedness to be humiliated.
[time=2620] He knew what it was like to have men spit on him and knock him and mock him.
[time=2624] He knew what it was like to stand up before an angry mob, and that mob would be gathered there just to jear in the mock him and to seek his life.
[time=2633] Paul knew the emotional abasements of life.
[time=2636] He knew what it was like to be a despised and rejected person.
[time=2640] Paul knew what it meant to live alone.
[time=2644] Peter had a wife.
[time=2646] Others of the apostles had wives.
[time=2649] Paul traveled alone, not by accident, not begrudgingly with contentment.
[time=2655] He knew that God had placed him as a single apostle to have a ministry.
[time=2661] In 1 Corinthians chapter 7, he called it a blessing and a gift that he could pour out his life into the ministry.
[time=2668] While marriage is honorable, he said God is so equipped him, and he was content in that state.
[time=2673] Paul knew what it was like to live in a based life.
[time=2678] Paul also knew how to live when there was an abundance.
[time=2681] There were days when churches like this Church of Philippi would take a love offering and they would take it and they would send it to Paul and Corinth so that Paul and Corinth could minister the Word of God.
[time=2693] Paul knew what it was like to have great abundance.
[time=2697] But you know, it's easier to live without than it is to live with great wealth.
[time=2703] Now some of you'd say I'd like to try that, but it really is.
[time=2707] I'll tell you why that is.
[time=2709] There is a false sense of spirituality attached to poverty,
[time=2715] and I underline the word false sense of spirituality that is attached to poverty.
[time=2723] During the Middle Ages, there was a concept that came upon the universal Church that poverty was a blessing and that the soul that really wanted to please God would take a vow of poverty.
[time=2736] And so there were those monks in different monastic orders
[time=2742] that would refuse to possess anything but suitable arrangement, and it was very humble, a based arrangement.
[time=2749] And they would go off and shelter themselves in a cloister, and there they would work as farmers, agronomists, raising a subsistence living hand to mouth possessing nothing that could be associated with this world beyond the absolute minimal need of clothing and food.
[time=2768] And that was viewed as spiritual.
[time=2770] May I say to you that is a false sense of spirituality.
[time=2775] That God does cause some of us to live at one level, and it's a difficult level, but that God does cause others of us to live at an affluent level.
[time=2786] And that God had so given Paul the ability of heart that he knew how to live with both.
[time=2794] It was very difficult for those who feel like they live a base to rejoice and to be thankful and not be bitter when someone else abounds.
[time=2804] But you know the abounding is also of the Lord, and to be given with thanks, as from the Lord.
[time=2812] You know who the first person that was that accused, abundance, that was Judas?
[time=2819] For there was a time when Mary of Bethany came to Jesus, and she took some spikenards, some beautiful, expensive fragrance, and she anointed his body.
[time=2831] And it was Judas that said, why wasn't this taken and sold and the money given to the poor?
[time=2838] Inside into life, Judas tells us he did not have a great concern for the poor, but he was the one that handled the money and was handling most of it from the collective person to his own.
[time=2849] But Judas said that could have been taken and sold for 100 denari.
[time=2854] Now, denari is worth 16 cents.
[time=2856] You say, hmm, 16 dollars, that's not all that much.
[time=2859] What's so expensive about that?
[time=2861] Well, take a lesson in inflation.
[time=2863] 16 cents was a total day's wages for an average worker in that time frame.
[time=2870] So that was 100 days worth of wages.
[time=2873] Let's do a little mathematics.
[time=2876] This week, US News and World Report says that the average income of industrial worker in the United States of the industrial worker is $25,400.
[time=2886] That comes out to $500 a week.
[time=2889] Divide that by five days and you have a working man at $100 a day.
[time=2894] More apply that by 100 days.
[time=2896] And that's Spike Nard on today's proportional buying power was $10,000.
[time=2903] Judas said, that's excessive.
[time=2905] That's extravagant.
[time=2907] God wouldn't want you to be extravagant.
[time=2910] Jesus said, oh, it was part of God's plan.
[time=2913] Because in the abundance that God had planned it as an anointing for his burial.
[time=2919] And we need to learn how to live in abasement and how to live in abundance
[time=2925] and in that to be content that I may have this much and someone else may have this much,
[time=2931] but I rejoice because God has put me where he has put me and to learn contentment in those situations.
[time=2939] Paul said, I know how to do both.
[time=2942] But you know what I think he was saying was not only did he know how to do both, but he knew how to make the bridges and the transitions.
[time=2950] It's one thing to be able to learn to live in abasement.
[time=2954] And on the other hand, to learn how to live in abounding.
[time=2960] But it's very difficult to learn how to make the transition.
[time=2964] Particularly when you go up and then you come down.
[time=2969] Some of you remember 1976 and '77, '78, good days of the economy.
[time=2975] It was during those days that you've made purchases of a house and you made financial commitments.
[time=2980] And somehow the abundance of those days has been taken away in 1980 and 1981 and '82.
[time=2987] And now what used to be abundance is really financial pressure.
[time=2992] And it's very easy to become bitter.
[time=2995] They say, God, why have you allowed me into the circumstances?
[time=2999] Paul said, what I have learned is I've learned to go with the cycles of life.
[time=3003] I've learned in the good days to give thanks and in the bad days to give thanks.
[time=3008] I know how to do that.
[time=3010] Thirdly, he said, I am instructed everywhere and in all things
[time=3017] to be full and to be hungry and to abound and to suffer need.
[time=3024] That little word instructed actually means to be initiated into.
[time=3029] What Paul's saying is through the years of my ministry, I've come through an apprenticeship and a journeymanship.
[time=3035] And I'm now a full-fledged craftsman in this game of contentment.
[time=3040] It means to be inducted as a man would be inducted into a fraternity or a lady into a sorority.
[time=3045] It means to be inducted as you might be inducted into a particular office.
[time=3050] Paul said, I've been inducted into the school of life.
[time=3053] And I'm now in graduate school.
[time=3055] I'm still learning.
[time=3056] But he said, learn from me.
[time=3058] My experiences give me the opportunity and the right to speak.
[time=3064] Then fourthly, he said this, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[time=3071] This idea of contentment is primarily a Greek notion.
[time=3075] This office and the Stoics both like to talk about contentment and they had good insight into contentment.
[time=3083] It was Socrates who said the happy man is the man who was content.
[time=3090] It was the Stoics who said, if you want to make a man happy, then add nothing to his possessions but take away from his desires.
[time=3101] But in their concept of contentment, the Greeks placed a great deal of attachment on being self-sufficient.
[time=3108] That I am an island and I have need of no one else.
[time=3112] I have learned to be within myself sufficient.
[time=3118] That is not the Christian notion of sufficiency.
[time=3121] Paul was not saying I'm content because I'm sufficient in myself.
[time=3125] He was saying I'm content because I can do anything that God calls me to do because I can do it through Christ who strengthens me.
[time=3134] He further elaborated upon it to the Church of Corinth.
[time=3138] In the second epistle he said, not that our sufficiency is in ourselves or out of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of the Lord.
[time=3146] Paul said, I can do, but that wasn't just positive mental thinking.
[time=3150] He said, through Christ, are in the power of Christ that dwells in me.
[time=3155] Now understand this verse in context.
[time=3158] Never take a verse out of context and twist it.
[time=3162] There are those that like to take this verse and then scroll it on a plaque and that's a lovely thing to do.
[time=3167] But then not to understand the context, they say I can do anything.
[time=3171] And therefore they devise this great plan and without any insight, they march off and do their plan in faith.
[time=3177] And that's the by word by which you cover up all poor planning, faith.
[time=3181] And they say I can do it because Christ strengthens me.
[time=3184] And they make a disaster out of their home.
[time=3186] They make a disaster.
[time=3188] Why is that?
[time=3190] Because what Paul was saying is God places me in various circumstances and in that placement I can handle it.
[time=3196] I can do whatever God calls me to do because Christ strengthens me.
[time=3202] What the verse is saying is I can run on any track that God places me because God will empower me to run on that track.
[time=3212] J. Vernon McGee gave this illustration.
[time=3215] He said that he loved to ride trains and there were super powered trains that had the ability to chug at 60 miles an hour.
[time=3223] Up the highest mountains of California, zip down the other side and on the flatlands go 113 miles an hour.
[time=3229] That train could do anything, anything that a train was designed to do.
[time=3236] But take that train off the track and all the power was useless, useless.
[time=3244] God places our life upon a track.
[time=3247] And when we learn contentment and power by him, we can say on this track that God has given me, I can accept anything.
[time=3255] I can do anything that God has given me to do.
[time=3260] Paul said I've learned and I'm still learning contentment.
[time=3266] Secondly, I now know how to live in any circumstance.
[time=3272] Thirdly, I've been inducted from a veteran of this game and fourthly I'm confident that I can do anything that God calls me to do.
[time=3282] Paul had learned to take his appetites and to put them on the altar and say,
[time=3290] "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies, your appetites, a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto him."
[time=3303] Have you taken your appetites and placed them upon the altar of God?
[time=3308] Your appetite for money, for just a little bit more.
[time=3312] Your appetite for food, if you learn to balance and to control your diet.
[time=3317] Your appetite for clothing, one is enough, really enough.
[time=3322] The Bible says that godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=3329] Perhaps there's some appetite that you need to put on the altar today.
[time=3333] If you don't, your appetite will not only not be controlled by you, your appetite will control you.
[time=3341] At the end of his life, J.D. Rockefeller, one of the wealthiest men in history, who put together the standard oil company, was asked Mr. Rockefeller if you could want something, what is it that you would want?
[time=3353] And he answered in one word, more, more. His appetite controlled him.
[time=3361] Until you put your appetite on that altar, it will control you.
[time=3366] Will you surrender it to him today? Let us pray together.
[time=3371] Appetite, more than just appetite for things God builds within us, an appetite for himself, to know God and to know Jesus Christ.
[time=3383] Do you know him today?
[time=3386] Or have you tried to fill the need to know God with a false appetite?
[time=3400] You have been listening to Pastor Rick Hawkes here in the Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3407] And if, as a result of Pastor Rick's message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your own personal Savior, we invite you right now to pray this prayer with us.
[time=3418] Dear Father, I thank you for Jesus Christ who is the Savior of the world.
[time=3423] And right now, I trust him as my own personal Savior. I believe that he died for me and in my place, and I transfer my faith in what I have been believing to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation.
[time=3437] Thank you for saving me. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3443] And we trust that many of you have responded in this way, and are trusting Jesus Christ at this very moment to be your personal Savior.
[time=3451] If you prayed that prayer, we'd like to send you this little booklet. It will be a help to you. It's called Your Decision.
