[time=26] [MUSIC]
[time=37] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=40] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=47] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=58] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=64] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Prueger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=75] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=84] Now, here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=93] We're thankful that we can share the Word of God with you this morning here in our church, but also that we can go beyond this church into the larger community of Fort Wayne, Chicago, and South Bend through the ministry of television.
[time=106] We welcome you today who are joining us for television.
[time=109] It's Mother's Day in Fort Wayne.
[time=111] We're so thankful for a day and our year that we lay aside to say thank you to our mothers for who they are, for the heritage that they've given to us in the Lord, for the example that they have set, and godliness as a pattern for life.
[time=126] I see many of you out here with your mothers.
[time=128] That is a delightful way to begin this Mother's Day by worshiping together and by praising the Lord.
[time=134] We now turn to the choir to let them lead us in our worship.
[time=138] They'll be singing for us because he loves us so the sanctuary choir.

[time=1230] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1232] We appreciate your ministry to us today.
[time=1235] Today is Mother's Day.
[time=1236] It's a day that we as a society and as a nation say, "Today we're going to honor our mothers." That's a good thing to do.
[time=1244] We should not replace a daily responsibility or opportunity and postpone it all to one day, but today we are thankful for our mothers, for the nurturing, the loving, the caring, the godly heritage that they have set before us today.
[time=1258] I'd like to ask all of the mothers in the auditorium if they would stand at this time that we could pray and thank God for them specifically.
[time=1266] Now ladies, you all hate to be first, but if you would just forego the usual graciousness and all stand together, not worry about who's first.
[time=1274] Thank you, ladies.
[time=1276] There are a lot of ladies here that have given life and the nurturing and the loving of a family, and we thank God for you today as our mothers and as our wives.
[time=1286] We want to pray for you, thanking God for you.
[time=1289] Our Father, we bow before you today, thanking you for the women of our lives, for our wives, for our mothers, and for the love that they give within a home, for the labor of their hand that brings dignity to a role, for the care that seems so endless, the times that they were there when they alone could give comfort, for their ceaseless energy, for their consistency and prayer.
[time=1317] Father, we thank you for them.
[time=1320] We praise you for their efforts.
[time=1323] Father, we not only thank you for them, but we pray for them that you would give to them a fulfillment as mothers, that you would give to them a sense of dignity and value, that they would know that as they serve in the process of motherhood and the raising of children, that that is pleasing to you.
[time=1342] That is a sacrifice of labor acceptable to you.
[time=1346] God, we pray for them that you would continue to give them energy, and joy, and being a mother, for it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1357] It would be good for us during these days, as we remember mothers to be praying for Carolyn Baylor, who lost her mother this weekend.
[time=1365] The services for Carolyn's mother will be in Remington, Indiana tomorrow at 1030, and I know she would appreciate your prayers in her behalf.
[time=1374] To prepare our hearts for the ministry of God's Word, alma mater Peterson are going to come and sing for us this morning, that the ministry of music might soften our troubled minds and cause us to rest, and open our hearts for Him.
[time=1388] alma mater Peterson Oh, Jesus, I have promised to serve you to the end.
[time=1419] O stay forever near me, my master and my friend,
[time=1433] I will not fear the battle.
[time=1439] If you are by my side, or wander from the pathway,
[time=1452] if you will be my God.
[time=1459] O let me feel you near me, the world is ever near.
[time=1474] I see those sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear.
[time=1487] My foes are all around me, around me and within.
[time=1500] But Jesus draw me near, and shield my life from sea.
[time=1516] O Jesus, you have promised to those who follow you.
[time=1532] That's where you are in glory, there will your servant be.
[time=1545] And Jesus, I have promised to serve you to the end.
[time=1603] Thank you, Al and Lena, for preparing our hearts, suiting us, calming us from the busyness of life.
[time=1612] We might give our attention to God's Word.
[time=1615] It was during the 70s, and even to a degree now during the 80s, that women have begun a quest for identity in their role in life.
[time=1623] There has been a great question as to whether the traditional values of a housewife and a mother are really the role that is fulfilling in life.
[time=1632] I remember coming across a unique experience in life that reminded me of the age of feminism.
[time=1638] We were doing some backpacking and mountain climbing in Grand Teton National Park, and we had just gotten to the point of the timber line early one morning after camping overnight, and here was a young couple camping out in the Bivwack tent, and they were up cooking breakfast and invited us to stop by for a cup of coffee, and just to talk for a few moments, and we shared our backgrounds and our interest.
[time=1659] We had opportunity to tell them of our faith in Christ.
[time=1662] A young lady says, "Well, I'm not quite sure she's like that." And I didn't quite understand what was happening.
[time=1667] The more we'd talk about God, she'd say, "But how do you know God's really like that?
[time=1670] She could be completely different." And we had several of these encounters, and it finally dawned on me that I was losing the picture.
[time=1678] She was going to insist that God be a she.
[time=1682] That fit into her values and her economy of life.
[time=1685] Now, it could be that we could debate whether God is male or whether God is female, or whether God's some unique being that is neither male nor female, or perhaps he's something like the dualism of the Orient, that there's a yin and a yang, and he's got a male part in the female part, and some argue that God the father is neither male nor female, and that God the son is male, and that God the Holy Spirit is female.
[time=1708] But you know that really wasn't her need.
[time=1710] She wasn't trying to discover or to argue theology on that morning.
[time=1714] What she had was a need for value in life, because someone had so impressed upon her the values that the only role for a woman is to be barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.
[time=1726] And then someone had imposed upon her the notion that that was God's role for her, and that was the only thing that God believed that she could do, would be to be barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.
[time=1739] Well, it is a traditional value in our society.
[time=1741] And our society is far better than many others.
[time=1744] There are societies where the man can walk, and the wife is not even permitted to walk, where he walks.
[time=1750] They say the role, there is a separation, the male is superior.
[time=1754] I don't believe the word of God teaches.
[time=1756] Any male versus female superior are inferior relationship.
[time=1761] But this young lady was sensing that it was God who said that she could not have a meaningful role in society, and therefore she objected to a God who was chauvinistic, and if she was going to believe in a God, then her God had to be a female by nature.
[time=1779] But it really wasn't a theological need.
[time=1781] It was a personal need to know that her life had value, other than to be found behind a hot stove with no shoes on, that she can contribute more to life than simply the biological reproduction of children.
[time=1797] A hunger to know a role that has meaning, that has identity.
[time=1803] You know, in many ways, because we are conservative, Bible-believing people, we have been associated with every conservative tradition, which may or may not be biblical.
[time=1814] I believe there is a biblical pattern in a biblical role, but it is not God who said that a woman has no value other than to cook and to bear children.
[time=1823] As a matter of fact, God places great value on the role of a woman, as a wife, as a homemaker, today, as a mother.
[time=1832] The God places value on that.
[time=1834] We would like to take the time to read you an article.
[time=1837] We did that last hour, and I'll apologize, you missed something, but it took so much time that I'll just abbreviate for you.
[time=1845] One young lady wrote, and she had said that perhaps the grass being greener on the other side of the street is once again not true.
[time=1854] She said that to leave the home and to discover that work is not necessarily more fulfilling,
[time=1861] and to pursue a career in an occupation may not be more creative than to be a mother, and she began to ask some questions.
[time=1868] What I know as ladies, as mothers and housewives, you suffer from a great deal of depreciation.
[time=1874] What you need to learn to do is what business men learn to do.
[time=1877] They learn to give rather creative, impressive titles to their rather uncreative, unimpressive jobs.
[time=1884] So ladies, next time you feel like you've answered the phone for the hundredth time for your husband, just view yourself as a telephone receptionist.
[time=1892] Or the next time you're tired of picking up your kids and dropping them off from one place to the other, just label yourself a transportation coordinator.
[time=1900] That has far more dignity than picking up the children.
[time=1904] Next time you're trying to teach that little one how to use that fork and to not slop the food everywhere,
[time=1910] instead of just feeling like your job is to clean up the mess, view yourself as a child development educator, and you'll have a much more fulfilled life.
[time=1919] The next time you have to spray a little back teen on a boo-boo and apply a band-aid, view yourself as a nurse, not as a clean-up committee.
[time=1928] When you're tired of cooking meals, don't feel that you just cook clean and scrub the pots.
[time=1933] Identify yourself as a gourmet cook.
[time=1936] That has great prestige in our community.
[time=1939] When your children are fighting, you're not the mother who has to pry them apart and to teach them to share, you're a child development psychologist.
[time=1947] When your husband brings guests home for dinner unannounced, don't feel like you're just the hired help.
[time=1952] You're the entertainment committee.
[time=1954] You see what we've done in society?
[time=1956] We've taken life outside the home and we've given it great prestige.
[time=1961] You know, we no longer have garbage men.
[time=1963] We have sanitation engineers.
[time=1965] Everybody has great prestige outside the home, but then we've taken the home.
[time=1969] We said, "There's no dignity. There's no worth to that." I want to share two thoughts with you as we come to the role of women in the Bible.
[time=1977] First of all, I want to share with you, although it's not our point today, I want to share with you that God honors and recognizes the labor of women outside of the home,
[time=1988] that God does not say that the wife is in prison in a home and that's the only role she can know.
[time=1994] You know, then in the Bible, there are illustrations of women serving in the larger community
[time=2000] and serving with the blessing of God and with great success.
[time=2003] Do you remember Lydia?
[time=2004] She was a business woman, an area of Macedonia, very instrumental in the beginning and the building of the Church of Philippi.
[time=2011] Deborah, in the Old Testament, was a woman who served as a judge, just like Gideon was a judge over Israel,
[time=2018] like Samson was a judge, Deborah was a judge, and far more effective than most of the men.
[time=2025] Far more effective.
[time=2027] That God does within his roles for women have roles of dignity and prestige in the larger community besides the home.
[time=2036] But secondly, I would share with you that the dominant biblical role for a woman is to be a housewife, a homemaker, and a mother, and that that role is one of tremendous dignity and value before God.
[time=2052] And whether men appreciate the role of the wife as homemaker and mother, God honors that and he considers it to be of great value.
[time=2063] Turn in your Bible with me, if you will, to Proverbs, chapter 31.
[time=2069] Proverbs, chapter 31, verses 10 through 31, in those 22 verses give to us what God upholds as the value of the mother and the homemaker.
[time=2083] Her dignity and her worth.
[time=2086] This morning rather than read these 22 verses for you at once, I'm going to read them three verses at a time and then discuss those with you.
[time=2095] But it's important that you understand something of Hebrew poetry before we enter into this discussion of the passage.
[time=2103] When you and I think of poetry, we usually think of things that have a particular pattern like an Iambic pentameter.
[time=2114] And that's poetry because it has that bounce to it. You see, this doesn't bounce as I read it.
[time=2118] We often think of poetry as that which has similar sound endings to the last words of the phrase.
[time=2125] In other words, there's a little rhyming pattern to the sounds.
[time=2129] In Hebrew poetry, there were a variety of different styles. This particular style is an alphabetical and acrostic.
[time=2136] And you say, "Good grief, I hope I don't catch it. What is it?" An alphabetical acrostic is this. It isn't acrostic that follows the alphabet.
[time=2144] You may not know what an acrostic is this morning.
[time=2147] Have you ever heard the definition of grace as God's riches at Christ's expense?
[time=2153] That's how we take each of the letters of grace and help to define the word. G, God, R, riches, A, at C, Christ, E, expense.
[time=2162] God's riches at Christ's expense. That's an acrostic.
[time=2165] Well, that may not be familiar with you, but have you ever listened to the radio or the television?
[time=2169] And there came a sandwich commercial and it ended in America's roast beef?
[time=2173] Yes, sir. And you remember that as Arby's trademark.
[time=2176] That's an acrostic, A, R, B, Y, S. America's roast beef? Yes, sir.
[time=2181] That's a teaching device.
[time=2183] And what God inspired the individual who wrote this proverb to do was to give it in a teaching device.
[time=2191] So that of these 22 verses, there are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
[time=2196] And each verse began with a new letter in the alphabet.
[time=2200] Verse 10 began with the word for woman, which began with the Hebrew letter, aleph, R, A.
[time=2206] Verse 11, the second verse began with the second Hebrew letter, bathe, a word, B.
[time=2212] And that was designed so that the people could remember this particular statement of God
[time=2219] about the value and the dignity of a woman in her home as a mother.
[time=2225] As a matter of fact, the use of the acrostic gave them a device by which they could learn it
[time=2231] and memorize it because God believed in the value of a woman so strongly that he gave his word
[time=2237] that we might know it and that we might even memorize in our heart the value of the woman of God.
[time=2245] Well, within these 22 verses, they break down into eight sections divided by three.
[time=2252] Now you say, no, wait a minute. Eight times three is 24. You said they're 22.
[time=2256] There are six sections of three verses and two sections of two verses.
[time=2261] The writer divides himself into eight different sections.
[time=2265] And we'll identify by using that outline this morning, eight points to the virtuous woman of God.
[time=2272] Verses 10 through 12.
[time=2275] Who can find a virtuous woman for her prices far above rubies,
[time=2281] the heart of her husband that's safely trusting her so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[time=2287] She will do him good and not even all the days of his life.
[time=2291] The first characteristic is an overall view.
[time=2294] It is the value or the characteristic of being a person, a virtue.
[time=2299] That God says that a wife is a virtue in the Proverbs.
[time=2303] It says he who finds a wife finds a good thing.
[time=2307] That God says there is virtue today in being a wife and in being a mother.
[time=2312] Matter of fact, there is such value and virtue to it that it is beyond being priced.
[time=2317] Now that doesn't make sense to you and I, but you know that in the days of the Bible, and even in the early days of this country, that when a young man loved a young woman and he wanted to marry her, he had to pay for her.
[time=2328] In other words, he had to pay her father something in order to take her hand in marriage.
[time=2333] Now I remember watching and reading about Indian tradition that often a bride was given in exchange for horses.
[time=2340] So there were some that were worth two horses, some three horses.
[time=2343] Some of you are worth a whole herd of horses by Indian tradition.
[time=2347] Well even in the Bible times, you remember Jacob, he wanted to marry and he wanted to marry one of Laban's daughters,
[time=2353] and therefore he had to work for seven years labor in order to marry that daughter.
[time=2360] She had worth.
[time=2361] She had value.
[time=2362] And then he tricked her and gave him the other daughter and got seven more years out of him.
[time=2366] Well within these traditions, there was an obligation to give financial or labor value in exchange to receive a wife.
[time=2378] But you know what God is saying here?
[time=2380] He is saying that the woman of virtue is far more valuable than any amount of rubies, the most precious stones that they knew.
[time=2389] She is priceless. She cannot be matched.
[time=2392] There is no dollar worth to your value.
[time=2395] And ladies, sometimes you leave the home that you might receive dollar worth, that you can receive a minimum wage,
[time=2401] or a fifty cents above minimum wage, or seven percent commission, that your work can receive a dollar's value.
[time=2408] And God says the value of the mother who makes a home for her family is beyond value.
[time=2415] It cannot be measured in the economy of society.
[time=2419] She is virtuous because she is beyond painful.
[time=2423] But she is also virtuous in that within her character, there is a dependability that her husband trusts,
[time=2430] that he doesn't go out worrying about spoil.
[time=2432] That means he doesn't have need of anything that he trusts his wife and their provision within the home is adequate and he can trust her.
[time=2440] First of all, she is a virtuous woman. She will do him good all the days of his life.
[time=2448] Secondly, verses 13 through 15, she seeketh wool and flax, worketh willingly with her hands.
[time=2455] She is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar.
[time=2459] She rises up also, wild as yet night, and give with food to her household in a portion to her handmaiden.
[time=2465] Not only is she virtuous, but she's industrious, that she works, that she labors, and she labors with her hands.
[time=2472] You know, there's something special about that which is made with the loving hands of a wife or of a mother that makes it far more precious and valuable than that which is store-botten.
[time=2484] Much to my wife's chagrin, I would much rather eat at home than to eat out.
[time=2490] She'd much rather eat out, that may be because she does the cooking.
[time=2494] But I like the labor of the hands, the way that that food is prepared and cooked.
[time=2499] And it's not only done with labor, but there's done with a sense of what do I like as a wife, what does my husband like, what do my children like, and it's good.
[time=2508] But it's a labor, it's effort.
[time=2511] Remember the first meal my wife cooked for us.
[time=2514] She cooked my favorite, Hamburg and French fries.
[time=2517] It was Hamburg and she did a good job with the Hamburg.
[time=2520] Set them on the table and went to find the potatoes to peel and begin making the French fries.
[time=2525] Hamburg's got a little cold.
[time=2527] You know, it's labor, it takes work, but she learned, you know, my wife can cook, she can cook well.
[time=2534] I've got 15 extra pounds to prove the value of the labor of her hands, but it takes effort to cook within the homes.
[time=2542] But you know, there's also within the labor of hands, God puts value upon creativity.
[time=2547] Notice the next verse.
[time=2548] It says she is like the merchant ships that bring with her food from afar.
[time=2552] What on earth does that mean?
[time=2554] Here's what it means.
[time=2555] That within a local geographical setting, there are certain things that are common to that geographical area.
[time=2562] Certain spices, certain grains, certain types of meat.
[time=2566] But if you want something different, then you have to have those imported.
[time=2571] And there was a great deal of excitement that as a ship would come into a harbor, it would bring with it something of a novelty.
[time=2579] Something of a creativity, of a newness, a spice of life into that community.
[time=2585] And here this man says that she works with her hands, and the labor of her hands is creative.
[time=2591] That it's like that ship that brings home something new.
[time=2595] Now, there are days in your lives when you appreciate Hamburg's and French fries.
[time=2599] But you know, my wife can cook manicotti like you wouldn't believe.
[time=2603] And she's learned to be creative.
[time=2605] And there's a sense of excitement in our home.
[time=2608] Because as a task is approached, it's not approaches.
[time=2611] Three meals a day, seven days a week, 21 meals for that week, 30 days in that month, and on, and on meal.
[time=2620] There's a sense of creativity and excitement.
[time=2623] To be industrious, but to labor with creativity.
[time=2626] Now, we honor that in the secular market, and we give a restaurant, four stars, three stars, two stars, one star, some of them, no stars.
[time=2634] But you can have within your family and your home, ladies, an industrious nature that brings within it all the creativity that society would dream of.
[time=2643] And God says that is of value to labor within your home and to labor with creativity to be an industrious homemaker and a mother.
[time=2652] And within that industriousness, there's no limitation of effort.
[time=2658] That she rises up while it is yet night and give a food to our household.
[time=2662] That means she's up early in the morning.
[time=2664] That's exactly, it means she's up early breaking bread.
[time=2667] It means she was up early baking it, slight preparing that meal for her family.
[time=2672] It is said that a man's work is from son to son, but a mother's work is never done.
[time=2677] That may be true.
[time=2678] But God honors the industrious woman within her home.
[time=2683] Thirdly, verses 16 through 18, she considers a field and bith it, and with the fruit of her hand, she planeth a vineyard.
[time=2691] She girdeth her loins with strength, and she strengthened her arms.
[time=2695] She perceives it that her merchandise is good, and her lamp goes not out by night.
[time=2700] Not only she virtuous and industrious, but she's also enterprising.
[time=2705] She's enterprising.
[time=2707] What that is saying is here is a woman, the woman of God who not only labors within her home, but she's a business woman.
[time=2714] That she has a keen sense of judgment, and that she goes out of her husband's at his particular vocation, and she went out and she bought land.
[time=2723] We usually view that that's something the men do.
[time=2725] You know, a woman stays home, she cooks, she cleans, she cuts coupons out of the paper, she saves money on the cat food, but did you know that God says that a virtuous woman is also an enterprising woman?
[time=2735] That she's a woman who goes out and she can investigate a market, she can assess land at its value,
[time=2741] she can see that can contribute to the larger family needs.
[time=2745] That may mean that she has a mind that can see that that land is going to get prishy, she's enterprising.
[time=2750] More than only that, look at verse 18, she perceives it that her merchandise is good.
[time=2755] That means that she is a manufacturer.
[time=2758] It may mean that she's making little things in her home, it may mean that she has a shop that she sets up in the form of the day.
[time=2764] But she's an enterprising woman, that there is not a prison wall called a hole, but there is enterprising activity of value outside that particular house.
[time=2775] Notice that says she girds herself with strength and she strengthens her arms.
[time=2779] That means as she goes into the business world, she's not going to get pushed around.
[time=2783] Men, you've probably already learned, but if you haven't learned it today, you're not going to out talk a woman.
[time=2787] Just accept that fact, they're good and enterprise and God says there is value of the industrious, virtuous woman to be a woman of enterprise.
[time=2797] Verses 19 through 21, she lay at their hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaffed.
[time=2804] She stretches forth her hand to the poor, yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy, she is not afraid of the snow for her household
[time=2811] and for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.
[time=2815] She's virtuous, industrious, enterprising, she is also a provider.
[time=2821] She provides for the needs within that particular family.
[time=2826] That as they go through the cycles and the change of life, her family is prepared and provided for in those cycles.
[time=2833] That is they can look upon the hermons and they can see the snow slowly coming down each day and they know that winter is near.
[time=2840] She's not afraid because of her hands have been with the hands at a spindle, weaving and making the clothing that will provide warmth and comfort for her family.
[time=2854] And she provides for them with a protective sense that a mother possesses.
[time=2859] She is a provider, but not only in her vision, the provision that she care for herself and for her own.
[time=2865] She has a sense that God has placed her here with the capacity that cares and provides for even the needy, verse 22.
[time=2874] Verse 20, she stretches out her hand to the poor, yay she reaches out to the needy.
[time=2879] There's a compassion within her provision that she provides not only for her own, but she's sensitive to any world at need.
[time=2887] Verse 22, 3, 24, she makes herself coverings of tapestry, her clothing is silk and purple.
[time=2895] Her husband is known in the gates and when he siteth among the elders of the land, she makes a fine linen and selleth it and deliverth girls into the merchant.
[time=2905] It says that she is a woman of honor, a woman of honor.
[time=2912] That's found first of all in that little word, purple.
[time=2916] The color and the dye of purple would come through the crushing of a certain type of beetle and as it would crush a dye-like quality of liquid would come out and it would color things purple.
[time=2929] It was rare and it was precious, therefore only the wealthy, the noble and the honored of the community would dress in purple.
[time=2938] And here was one who knew the value of honor and she demeaned her house with honor.
[time=2947] She decorated with honor, she closed them with honor, she recognized as a woman of honor.
[time=2955] And then it says something peculiar in the middle of that.
[time=2958] It says her husband is known in the gates when he siteth among the elders of the land.
[time=2965] You know, so many times people are known as women as someone's wife.
[time=2971] Kathy is often known as Rick's wife.
[time=2976] That was somewhat frustrating, but over the last year she's received a new identification.
[time=2981] She's now known as Rachel's mother and those don't seem to say that she has value.
[time=2986] But you know what the Hebrew was telling us by inspiration of God in here that he is saying that the husband who has a man in the city and in the community who is recognized as a leader and an elder is there because of his wife.
[time=3002] It has been said that for every great man there is one great woman that stands behind him.
[time=3009] I would object.
[time=3010] I would say there are two great women behind him.
[time=3013] His mother and his wife.
[time=3015] And what the Hebrew is saying is because of this woman's sense of honor and because of her abilities that this man is launched and known within the community because of the value and the virtue of his wife.
[time=3030] She opens her mouth with wisdom and in the tongue of the law is kindness.
[time=3038] She looketh well in the ways of her household and is not of the bread of idleness.
[time=3049] She's a woman of honor and here she is a woman of dignity, of dignity in three areas of her life.
[time=3056] She knows the dignity of wisdom.
[time=3060] You know it is a caricature and an inaccurate one that the woman is somehow an idol gossip.
[time=3067] Joke was told on the Nassau research team that when they had planted a particular satellite on the area of the moon that they got a busy signal and concluded that there were women on the moon.
[time=3078] Is that really the role of women?
[time=3080] God says they have a role of great dignity.
[time=3087] Women aren't entered in the idol shadow.
[time=3090] There may be some that do that.
[time=3092] That may be a way that a comedian on television gets laughs and maybe we characterize someone who's blonde and attractive that they couldn't possibly have any brains.
[time=3101] But God said that a woman brings dignity to her life because she offers to her house and to her family wisdom.
[time=3109] That our wives are wiser than we are and that we would be wise to defer to their judgment.
[time=3116] Howard Hendricks explained something so well.
[time=3119] He said that God has said that as the man I am the head of the household and I am responsible for every decision that is made, but not to make every decision.
[time=3131] He said there are some decisions that my wife is wiser in and I am wise if I allow her decision to lead.
[time=3139] I'm responsible not to make the decision, but I'm responsible for every decision that is made.
[time=3145] She is dignified by her wisdom.
[time=3147] She is dignified by her kindness.
[time=3150] It is within the dimension of a woman to be loving, to be gracious and to be kind.
[time=3155] And she teaches that value in her home.
[time=3158] There were 69 kings at a particular point in the history of France and a historian noted that of those 69 kings only three of them loved the people and were loved by the people and ruled with kindness.
[time=3173] And then his story went on to say that out of those 69 kings the three that loved and ruled with kindness were the only three who were raised by their mothers.
[time=3185] All the others were raised by tutors and mentors and they learned not the dignity of kindness.
[time=3192] It is a royal trait.
[time=3194] Thirdly she knows the dignity of labor.
[time=3197] The chief does not have an idle mind, but there is within her mind a creativity that says that I labor and my labor has value and it has dignity and is pleasing to God.
[time=3210] Her children rise up and call her blessed and he praises her.
[time=3217] Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excel us them all.
[time=3224] It is saying that this woman is respected.
[time=3229] She is respected within her home by her children and by her husband.
[time=3235] You know there are times in our life that we go through cycles.
[time=3240] Early childhood years there is great respect, obedience and love that is free throwing flows from the child to the parent, respect and love.
[time=3251] But they often enter into those middle years, the late elementary in the teen years when somehow it seems so unpopular to show love and respect to our parents.
[time=3261] Young people may share with you that God is pleased when you honor and respect your mother.
[time=3268] It is never appropriate, although every classmate may do it.
[time=3271] It is never appropriate to refer to your father as your old man and your mother as your old lady.
[time=3277] They have value, they have dignity, they have raised you and you please God when you respect them.
[time=3284] I know that your dad may wear some ties that will embarrass you when your friends see you, but believe it or not young people, there was a day when that tie was in style.
[time=3295] Don't tell him to throw it away because it will be back in style in two years and you will wish you had it.
[time=3301] He won't give it to you because you laughed at him this morning when he wore it.
[time=3305] It is a good thing to respect our parents.
[time=3308] But notice that her husband praises or her children praise her. Her husband comes home, he said, "Honey, I have been out working all day and I have bumped into a dozen different women."
[time=3318] And many of them are fine women. I track them. Capable. There are many virtues, but honey, there aren't any that hold a candle to you.
[time=3329] Men, you know something? Your wife is greeted with that type of temperament often. She won't ever want for appreciation outside the home.
[time=3339] When she knows she is loved and respected, she won't have to turn her ambition away from your home to find fulfillment. She is a respected woman.
[time=3349] Finally, verses 30 and 31, favor is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who feareth the Lord, she shall be praised, give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates.
[time=3364] They are saying finally that she is Godly, that she is a Godly woman, that phrase who feareth the Lord. And she sets within her home an example and a heritage of Godliness.
[time=3380] That there is a character and a role that children learn by example. And there are different points in the development of children where they closely relate with the mother.
[time=3390] And then another point where they closely relate with the father. Then another point where they closely relate with the parent of their own sex.
[time=3398] But throughout that, God has placed you as mothers within your home to live, to talk, to walk, and to model Godliness within your home.
