[time=15] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=18] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=25] Their preaching centers on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=36] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=41] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=52] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=62] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=70] >> To begin our second worship service, we're excited to see you here on these good summer-like mornings.
[time=78] We never had a spring this year, and if spring was your favorite time of year, you missed it.
[time=83] But Maria Gardner is going to sing with her husband Steve, bring back the springtime later in the service, so we'll look forward to that particular ministry of music as we jump from winter to summer here.
[time=96] But we're thankful that you're with us today.
[time=99] We've come to worship God through the singing of praise to His name and from the very attitude of our hearts.
[time=104] We're thankful that you've come to worship.
[time=107] And each week we're so thankful for those that join us through the ministry of television.
[time=111] Thank you for opening up your home to us so that we can share with you what Jesus Christ means in our lives.
[time=117] Today the choir sings for us a very beautiful and powerful song, "I Sing the Mighty Power of God." They're under the direction of Mr. Don Kruger.
[time=127] [MUSIC - 135 seconds]
[time=274] - And I'm sure after a thrilling hymn like that, you want to join in and sing.
[time=278] And that's what we invite you to do right now.
[time=280] We're going to use hymn number 190, Rejoice, the Lord is King.
[time=285] We invite you who are listening at home to join right along and sing.
[time=289] This beautiful song will sing the first and last ends is of Rejoice, the Lord is King.
[time=295] And shall we stand now as we worship the Lord.
[time=300] [MUSIC - 61 seconds]
[time=366] - Thank you for the excellent singing
[time=372] and you may be seated.
[time=373] Now as Pastor Rick mentioned, we have gone through quite a winter.
[time=379] And it's so beautiful to be now in summer-like season, even though we really are still in spring.
[time=385] There's a spiritual parallel to this.
[time=388] And Stephen Marie Gardner sing about that.
[time=390] When our hearts get cold, the prayer should be Lord, bring back the springtime.
[time=397] Stephen Marie Gardner.
[time=399] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=441] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=558] - Hello and welcome again to this part of our program
[time=576] which we call the family time.
[time=579] It's our chance to take a few minutes to talk directly with you friends who join us as a part of our television family.
[time=585] Hello Don and how are you today?
[time=587] - I'm fine Pastor Rick, how's everything with you?
[time=590] - Things are going just great.
[time=591] I'm enjoying this summer weather and the summer means that the patriotic panorama is not too far away.
[time=597] - Well it's really just around the corner and we're getting excited about it.
[time=601] We have some good things that we're going to be incorporating in this year's panorama.
[time=605] Pastor Rick is going to take a very major role.
[time=608] He's going to be doing the narration on most of it in costume.
[time=611] He'll be preaching the message that goes along with it and we're featuring this year as we have last year our own Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=619] So along with the sanctuary choir and the special singers in our church, Stephen Maria and Pastor Rick, I think we're going to have a good panorama this year.
[time=627] - Well I'm looking forward to it in a special way.
[time=629] I love the ministry of music, particularly music, that blends together two things that I love, the Lord Jesus Christ in this country.
[time=638] Patriotic panorama is particularly special for me because as a college student, I majored in US history, particularly the revolutionary war.
[time=646] So I'm looking forward to it.
[time=648] What's the name of the music that we'll be doing this year?
[time=651] - We're going to center our patriotic panorama around a theme cantata called Ring All the Bells of Freedom.
[time=657] Gives the idea that the men who suffered and gave their lives and did great things and stepped in great strides for our country were men who really rang a bell for freedom.
[time=668] And we're going to get all these men to talk about them, share them with the congregation.
[time=674] And then we're going to say we're going to bring all those bells of freedom.
[time=677] - Well that will be exciting and I'm looking forward to that time.
[time=681] Each week we try to take a few moments to share with you something in the way of Christian literature that would be helpful for you.
[time=689] Again this week Don is going to share with you a little booklet entitled Timeless Insights.
[time=695] - Timeless Insights is a devotional guide that we have been offering for the last few weeks.
[time=700] And I'm sure that those of you who have received this offer and taken us up on it have enjoyed it tremendously.
[time=706] It is a devotional guide, some verses of scripture for every day and then some comments by men of God like Martin Luther and other great men who have lived and have studied the Word of God and have learned from experience what the Word of God means in their own life.
[time=723] They share their insights and those insights are timeless insights.
[time=728] We want to send this to you and it will be a good help and guide for your devotional life.
[time=733] Please write to the Bible Hour.
[time=736] Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and we will be so delighted to send this to you.
[time=744] The Bible Hour, Box 15,00015,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=753] Well Don, I know that little booklet will go a long way to helping people to become personally, actively and regularly involved with personal Bible study which is one of the foundational keys to growth in the Christian life.
[time=767] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour and we have some music to share with you.
[time=771] Don, what will be happening musically in the remainder of our service?
[time=775] - Well just a few minutes we're going to hear not something musically but something vocal from our choral reading English class at the Black Hole Christian School they're going to be giving us a choral reading which is always delightful when they do that.
[time=788] And then again we're going to listen to Steve and Maria.
[time=791] Maria's going to sing a solo and we always delight to hear her but we had so many comments when Steve sang because he doesn't do that very often.
[time=798] He's very shy and very bashful but he's going to be singing a solo too and so our hearts are going to be blessed again.
[time=805] - Well that'll be great.
[time=806] I'm looking forward to starting for you a new series of messages entitled The Songs of Life.
[time=813] Plato said in his Republic that education in music is a sovereign thing because nothing more than rhythm and harmony enter into the secret places of the soul.
[time=826] God has written a book of songs called The Psalms and today we'll study a song to sing when your stresses exceed your strengths.
[time=836] - Thank you today for joining us.
[time=837] We have a sponsor today who we want to thank.
[time=841] Their names are the Davos.
[time=842] Maynard and Esther Davo are members of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and they watch the Bible Hour on Sunday mornings.
[time=849] Don they come here at eight o'clock for Sunday school, stay for the first service and then go home and watch it on television.
[time=855] And we're so thankful for them helping us with this ministry by sponsoring the Bible Hour today on channel 21 WPTA.
[time=864] You know, Pastor Rick, the Davos not only help us as far as their financial aid is concerned and their attendance, but many times I see them in the mailroom and they're working with the mailing and helping get literature out to your home.
[time=878] Now, don't forget if you would like timeless insights, please write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, 1500 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=889] - Thank you and stay with us now as we hear music.
[time=894] Choral readings from the Word of God.
[time=896] And then as we open up to Psalm 46, a song of life, a song to sing when your stresses exceed your strength.
[time=906] (upbeat music)
[time=915] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=1037] - Thank you, Steve.
[time=1046] The ministry of music through the uniqueness of guitar often penetrates in way that the familiarness of an organ and a piano cannot music.
[time=1056] It penetrates and it speaks to the innermost parts of our soul.
[time=1061] We treasure the word of God as a family of believers, as a ministry, we're committed to the word of God.
[time=1068] I'm thankful for these young people who've come today to become a scriptural choir for us and to present through a dramatic production, the word of God, our speech and drama class from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1081] - Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave and behold, a severe earthquake had occurred for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
[time=1103] - And his appearance was like lightning and his garment as white as snow.
[time=1107] - And the guard shook for fear of him and became like dead men.
[time=1112] - And the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you're looking "for Jesus who has been crucified.
[time=1120] "He is not here, for he has risen just as he said.
[time=1124] "Come, see the place where he was lying.
[time=1127] "Angle quickly and tell his disciples "that he has risen from the dead and behold, "he is going before you into Galilee.
[time=1136] "There you will see him, behold, I have told you." - And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and rans to report it to his disciples.
[time=1149] And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them.
[time=1155] - And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
[time=1159] - And he spoke to them.
[time=1161] - All authority has been given to me
[time=1167] in heaven and on earth.
[time=1169] Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations.
[time=1174] - Advising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=1178] - Teaching them to observe all that I commanded you.
[time=1183] - And though I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=1188] - Thank you, young people.
[time=1194] That in a very powerful way presents to us the resurrection.
[time=1198] And the resurrection always demands responsibility.
[time=1202] That as Christ arose, he gave power to his disciples and they then were responsible to be sharing it everywhere they go.
[time=1211] Today we'll start a new message, our series of messages from the book of Psalms.
[time=1216] The series is entitled The Songs of Life.
[time=1220] Today's message is, what do you sing when your stresses exceed your strengths?
[time=1225] And that's a song that we not only sing for ourselves, but today we want to be praying for the family of Mark Lawson.
[time=1233] Many of you know Mark is a young man from our church who was hit in a hit and run accident in the early hours of Friday.
[time=1241] And he is in a coma at Parkview Hospital.
[time=1244] And we want to take this opportunity to pray for him and for his parents, Jenny and Cecil Lawson.
[time=1250] Our Father, we come to you today with a heart that is heavy.
[time=1255] There are songs that we sing that are songs of great triumph and jubilation.
[time=1261] Father, there are also songs that we sing of the brokenness of life.
[time=1265] And Father, we don't know the future, but you do.
[time=1270] Father, we don't have an answer as to why, but you do.
[time=1276] Father, we don't have the strength to heal the broken heart of a mother and a father, but you do.
[time=1282] We ask that you would give comfort to Cecil, to Jenny, as they wait, as their son is in a coma waiting for.
[time=1291] What the doctor's word would be, waiting for his body to recover.
[time=1296] God, we pray that your arms of love would be wrapped around them and locked secure.
[time=1301] We pray, Father, for Mark.
[time=1303] We're so thankful for the hospital, the doctors and the technicians, the way that you sow gifted men in the realm of science and medicine to heal, to bring about the processes of recovery.
[time=1315] Father, we do not trust today in medicine.
[time=1318] We trust in you.
[time=1320] And so we pray asking you to bring about a quick, a miraculous recovery in Mark's body and lift him up.
[time=1327] For it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1331] Prayer is the ministry of intercession.
[time=1335] Jesus is our intercessor.
[time=1336] He stands before the Father and the Holy Spirit intercedes for us in prayer.
[time=1341] Maria Gardner comes now to sing a song for us entitled, "Intercession." (gentle music)
[time=1349] [MUSIC - 226 seconds]
[time=1591] (gentle music) - Thank you, Maria.
[time=1610] The Ministry of Music is a ministry of great prominence in our church, and that is by design.
[time=1616] For music has the ability, no other medium has, to speak to us in a unique way.
[time=1623] Plato said that the study of music is a sovereign study for nothing else like rhythm and harmony is able to speak to the innermost parts of the soul.
[time=1636] That's through the music that God often penetrates our hearts in a unique way, and we hear them afresh.
[time=1644] The book of Psalms really means the book of songs
[time=1650] that God gave to the nation of Israel at different points in their history, songs to sing.
[time=1656] Some of them are great songs of triumph and jubilation of victory and battle and confidence in God.
[time=1664] Other songs are much more serene.
[time=1666] They're songs of reflection, songs of looking within and evaluation.
[time=1673] Some of the songs are great shouts of praise.
[time=1676] Some of them instruct us to clap our hands and to make a joyful noise.
[time=1681] Other of the songs tell us that we're to be quiet, to be still and know that God is in our midst.
[time=1689] God has given to us a book of songs that through the expression of those songs that we might understand life, that we might know God in a more intimate and more personal way, the songs of life.
[time=1704] Each of these particular songs that we will study in our series are songs that came out of the real experiences of human dilemma and trauma.
[time=1715] And so there is a relationship that we can draw between our life today and a historical person, our people.
[time=1722] And we can begin to empathize with their experience, but in that empathy we can see God working in their life and make the translation into our own.
[time=1733] The songs of life, music, the persistent, invigorating beat of the drum, can stir our hearts in the calmness and the serenity of a 12 string guitar, can soothe and calm us.
[time=1750] And in the night of life a song can bring peace, even in the stresses of life.
[time=1758] Longfellow set of music and the night shall be filled with music.
[time=1765] And the cares that infest the days shall fold their tents like Arabs and quietly, silently slip away.
[time=1777] Music is that portion of God which can calm our troubled hearts,
[time=1784] particularly when we take the Psalms and we sing them.
[time=1788] Today we talk about the subject.
[time=1790] What song do you sing when your stresses far exceed your strengths?
[time=1797] We come to the first Psalm of our study, Psalm 46.
[time=1802] And I invite you to open your Bible that you might follow along as I read for you, the 11 verses of Psalm 46.
[time=1811] You may notice that in many of the Bibles and accurately so, there is an inscription at the top to the choir director.
[time=1819] It says to the chief musicians.
[time=1823] This is meant to be sung.
[time=1826] Verse 1, God is our refuge and strength,
[time=1832] a very present help in trouble, therefore will not we fear,
[time=1839] though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters there are roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
[time=1853] Selah.
[time=1855] There is a river the streams were of shall make glad,
[time=1861] the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle
[time=1867] of the Most High.
[time=1869] God is in the midst of her.
[time=1873] She shall not be moved.
[time=1875] God shall help her and that right early.
[time=1881] The nations raged.
[time=1882] The kingdoms were moved.
[time=1884] He uttered his voice.
[time=1886] The earth melted.
[time=1888] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=1891] The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[time=1895] Selah.
[time=1897] Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
[time=1903] He makeeth wars to cease unto the end of the earth.
[time=1906] He breaketh the bow.
[time=1907] He cuteth the spear and sundered.
[time=1910] He burnedeth the chileate in the fire.
[time=1914] Be still and know that I am God.
[time=1918] I will be exalted amongst the nations.
[time=1922] I will be exalted in the earth.
[time=1925] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=1927] The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[time=1931] Selah.
[time=1932] A song for when your stresses exceed your strengths.
[time=1937] It was a song given in a particular point of history and it was intended to be sung.
[time=1942] As we opened our hymn books this morning, we observe a pattern that in a particular hymn, there are two particular sections.
[time=1949] There is the stanzas and the chorus.
[time=1953] You sing a stanza and then the chorus.
[time=1955] You sing a second stanza, you repeat the chorus.
[time=1958] A third stanza, you repeat the chorus.
[time=1961] That's exactly what type of song we have for us.
[time=1963] The first stanza is verses one through three.
[time=1967] It is the song of the protection of God.
[time=1972] Then there is intended the time to sing the chorus.
[time=1976] That little word, Selah, represents a break.
[time=1979] It may have been a point where the trumpets would blow, the shout how you would come, but it represents a break in the song.
[time=1986] And now the chorus is given to us on two occasions.
[time=1989] It should follow each of the three sealers.
[time=1991] It is found in verse seven and 11.
[time=1993] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=1995] The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[time=1997] That was the chorus that they sang between the stanzas.
[time=2001] So the first stanza was that God gives us a song of protection.
[time=2007] The second stanza, verses four, five, and six, give to us a song of the provision of God.
[time=2015] And then the stanza ends and the chorus comes back.
[time=2019] In verse seven, the Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=2021] The God of Jacob is our refuge.
[time=2024] Verses eight, nine, and ten give us the song of the response
[time=2030] of the people of God.
[time=2032] And then the chorus.
[time=2034] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=2036] The God of Jacob is our strength.
[time=2039] Song of protection, provision, and response.
[time=2044] God gives a song.
[time=2046] For when stresses in life seem to exceed our strengths.
[time=2051] Stress can come in any number of matters.
[time=2053] A group of medical doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists have worked together, and there is now available a stress scale or a stress index.
[time=2062] And they can tell you that certain events in your life will cause certain amounts of stress.
[time=2068] The highest would be 100 units of stress would be caused by the death of someone in your immediate family, the death of a maid.
[time=2077] 75 points for those who suffered the broken relations
[time=2083] of divorce and separation.
[time=2085] Even some of the simplest things in life can cause stress.
[time=2090] Christmas is at least worth 12 points on the stress scale.
[time=2096] Anyone who adds up to 300 points of stress is in a very great point of mental and emotional danger.
[time=2103] And yet many of us today, if we were to add up on the stress index, we would discover that there is a great deal of stress in our life.
[time=2112] One man has written a very popular and well-received book entitled There's More to Being Healthy than Not Being Sick.
[time=2123] Illness is only one dimension of health.
[time=2126] There's the emotional dimension that stress can deteriorate our bodies physically, mentally, and emotionally.
[time=2133] But we can't stop the avalanches of life that come upon us.
[time=2137] And where does the strength come from when our stress seems so high?
[time=2141] The historical setting of this particular song is a time of great stress in the life of Hezekiah, the king.
[time=2148] It comes to us out of the pages of Second Kings, chapters 18 and 19.
[time=2153] There is a great military might, the Assyrian army, that is marching down like a war monster machine.
[time=2161] Moving southward towards Israel.
[time=2163] And they are consuming nation after nation.
[time=2166] Their mighty leader, Sennacherib, is a man who seems unstoppable in his military might and his hunger for domination unquenched.
[time=2175] And Sennacherib sends an emissary to the city, and he comes before the king.
[time=2181] And he says to Hezekiah, we will destroy you.
[time=2184] Surrender now and join with us.
[time=2187] We will destroy you.
[time=2192] Stress.
[time=2194] Hezekiah refused.
[time=2195] And he said that God would be His deliverer, that God would be His rock.
[time=2199] And then this emissary left the court of the king.
[time=2202] And he went out to the people.
[time=2203] And he went to the gates in the city where the people were collected.
[time=2207] And he said to them, don't listen to your king Hezekiah.
[time=2213] Don't listen to him.
[time=2215] Don't believe what he has to say.
[time=2217] I'll tell you what Hezekiah is going to say.
[time=2219] Your king's going to come out here and say that your God will deliver you.
[time=2224] The emissary said, I've heard that all before.
[time=2226] I heard that when I was in Syria.
[time=2229] I heard the Syrians say that God will deliver-- and their God didn't deliver them.
[time=2234] I heard it in Samaria.
[time=2236] The Samaritans said, oh, our God will deliver it.
[time=2238] And we destroyed the Samaritans.
[time=2241] I've heard it all before.
[time=2242] People and don't listen to Hezekiah was a time when their enemy seemed so great.
[time=2248] And if they took an inventory of the enemy and an inventory of their own army, the stress far outweighed their strength.
[time=2257] And the people feared for their life.
[time=2260] But out of the experience-- and we'll finish the story of history in a moment-- but out of that experience was born song 46.
[time=2270] It begins with the shout of confidence, a song of the protection of God.
[time=2276] God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in the time of trouble.
[time=2283] In the days of the Bible, military warfare was always a hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2290] And it was a matter of raw numbers and might against might.
[time=2296] The only places of safety were cities that were walled cities.
[time=2301] And one of the might of Babylon was its great walls.
[time=2306] Huge walls towering into the sky.
[time=2308] Walls totally impregnable by sheer power against them.
[time=2312] Walls so thick that they actually ran chariot races on top of them.
[time=2316] Eight chariots abreast.
[time=2319] Huge thick walls.
[time=2321] And the people would think that I am safe in my city.
[time=2324] And they would flee to the cities with their great walls.
[time=2327] And their great wooden gates, even with a sense of lamination, board, crossing board, reinforcing it, with towers above those gates to defend and to shoot down from the top on an enemy who could not make an advance at the top.
[time=2342] So the people spoke of citadels, of cities that gave to them our refuge, a place of hiding.
[time=2350] And here the psalmist said that we have a place of hiding in our God, a place of strength.
[time=2356] A God who was able to deliver and defend.
[time=2360] But notice the description, it says, though the earth be removed and the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.
[time=2370] That speaks of an earthquake.
[time=2372] An earthquake that could shake the great mountains and cause those mountains to come tumbling down with avalanche power and wiping out everything in its sight.
[time=2382] And roll all the way from their mountain tops to the very sea, covering the entire land.
[time=2389] Traumatic earthquake.
[time=2392] And then it goes on to say, though the waters there are roar and be stirred and troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
[time=2399] It speaks of a tidal wave of flood waters that come pouring out upon the land and would destroy everything that was in its path.
[time=2412] And it speaks of all the earth shaking.
[time=2414] And yet in the middle of that, there is a figure of speech, a play on words.
[time=2420] Because though those mountains fall and shake and tremble, and though the sea rocks, it says, therefore, will not we fear.
[time=2430] The word fear means to tremble.
[time=2432] It means to shake.
[time=2434] And what the writer of this song is saying is all the world is shaking and falling apart around me.
[time=2441] I will not shake.
[time=2443] I won't tremble.
[time=2445] Though the ground under me seems to move.
[time=2448] My life will stand.
[time=2451] It was speaking of the protection of God.
[time=2454] But I really don't believe the writer had in mind here a literal earthquake or a little avalanche, our literal flood, although he was speaking in honesty that those things be true.
[time=2466] I believe he is using this as a metaphor to say when life with its stresses hits us with an earthquake proportion that our lives can still stand.
[time=2477] And we don't have to shake, regardless of the stress scale, that God can provide a protection for us.
[time=2485] And the beauty of the protection of God is that he is not somewhere over the rainbow.
[time=2492] It says that he is a very present help and trouble.
[time=2497] In the nation of Israel, they had cities of refuge.
[time=2501] Cities where a person who was being hunted by an avenger could run to that city.
[time=2505] And there in that city, he was safe.
[time=2509] But you had to run and you had to make it to the city.
[time=2513] Should you be an agrarian and working out in your field and you would see the enemy coming down, you had to flee to the walls of a city.
[time=2520] And there, you could be protected.
[time=2523] But it says that God is present.
[time=2526] A very real help.
[time=2527] He is there.
[time=2528] He is not somewhere you have to run to.
[time=2530] But he is there.
[time=2532] That he is with us.
[time=2533] And that he is the God of our protection.
[time=2536] And as life begins to build around this stress, God begins to build around this protection and a wall.
[time=2544] That he is in control.
[time=2546] The word that we so often use in a theological sense, predestination, the word means to set the limits.
[time=2555] That God has set the limits as to what you'll bring into our life, that his limits will protect us.
[time=2562] And that he is in control of whatever comes into our life.
[time=2566] There are things that are far more devastating than simply the trauma of a mountain that would shake.
[time=2573] There are things far more fearful than the floodwaters of the St. Joe or the St. Mary's or the Mommy.
[time=2580] There are things far more painful than that.
[time=2583] There's far more pain in the loss of the mate than there is in the loss of the home.
[time=2588] There's far more in the brokenness of a relationship than there is in the brokenness of material things.
[time=2595] There's no greater hurt than I can imagine than the herd of rejection when spouse rejects spouse, when child teenage in its rebellious time rejects parents or when parents reject children.
[time=2609] Oh, when the avalanches of emotion hit, God said he'll build a wall around us.
[time=2615] And he will protect us, Selah.
[time=2619] But then it goes on to speak not only the protection of God, but of the provision of God.
[time=2625] It says verse four, "There is a river.
[time=2628] The streams thereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of their tabernacles of the Most High.
[time=2634] God is in the midst of her.
[time=2636] She shall not be moved." You see, even if you could make it to a city with its great military security, you are not safe.
[time=2645] Because there was one thing that could even be worse than to be caught outside the city by the enemy.
[time=2652] And that is to be trapped inside.
[time=2655] And although it would take months, and on occasion years, these enemies, the Assyrians, were known that they besieged their foes.
[time=2663] And as they trapped them in a city, then they would seal off the city.
[time=2667] And there would be no food, and there'd be no water.
[time=2670] And in Second Kings, the emissary comes, and he says to the people of Jerusalem.
[time=2675] And he says to the people of all that land, he said, "Don't think you're going to be safe in your cities, because you'll come to eat your dung and to drink your urine.
[time=2685] We're going to lock you in and choke your life out and to starve you." Notice what it says, that God not only protects, but he provides.
[time=2695] It says, "There is a river.
[time=2697] The streams thereof shall make glad the city of God." What that is saying is God not only builds around his city of protection.
[time=2704] He builds within it the provision of water, water.
[time=2709] That the city that had great walls, and also had a river, that flowed through it was a city that could withstand besiegement.
[time=2717] Babylon was such a city.
[time=2720] And their water that came out of the land of Mesopotamia through that Tydrus River supplied to them life, and they could withstand many besiegements.
[time=2729] But water here is a picture of the person of God.
[time=2732] In the midst of our trial, we not only builds around this protection to ward off our stress, but he builds into our life the strength, water, the picture of God.
[time=2744] He is in the midst of all the stresses and the anxiety of life.
[time=2750] Jeremiah, the second chapter, God says, "Oh, people, why have you hewn out systems that can hold no water?
[time=2757] Instead of coming to me, I will give you water." God was saying that he would be their strength, their source, and their supply.
[time=2765] Jesus Christ is spoken of in Zachariah prophetically.
[time=2769] Zachariah 13, that God would place him as the water of life.
[time=2774] And then he said it so well to the woman of the well, that if you knew who it was, I, who asked you for a drink, you would ask of me, and I would give you living water.
[time=2783] That you never need to thirst again, a woman that knew the brokenness of life, despised because of her ethnic background, despised because of her immorality, someone who had to sneak to the water at the heat of noon when no one else went, because of the stress of the ridicule of people.
[time=2802] She discovered there was one who could offer her water, a provision to endure and to give strength.
[time=2809] God is the water of life.
[time=2811] And Jesus cried out in the city of Jerusalem that the Spirit of God would give to us a water that we'd never thirst again.
[time=2820] And there is within the stresses of life the provision of God that he will provide for his people, that which they need to sustain them and to withhold them.
[time=2832] God is in the midst of your stress.
[time=2836] He knows the trauma that you're facing this morning.
[time=2839] He knows the financial pressure that some of you just are locked under.
[time=2843] And the economy of our city and the loss of a job seems to have you bottled in a corner.
[time=2850] But no beloved that God is in the midst of that.
[time=2853] I cannot explain to you what he's going to do and how he's going to deliver you.
[time=2857] But he says that he is in the midst of our stresses.
[time=2861] And he will provide for you.
[time=2863] Some of you today are going through one of the greatest droughts you've ever experienced in life.
[time=2868] The drought of emotional deprivation of love.
[time=2872] You feel like life has left you behind.
[time=2875] And the people that you've given to of your energy, of your time as a mother, as a wife, have passed you by.
[time=2883] God knows that that hurt.
[time=2885] He says that he's the water of refreshment, the provision that will sustain you under the stresses of life.
[time=2895] Then it says the nation's raged.
[time=2897] The kingdoms were moved.
[time=2899] He uttered with his voice.
[time=2900] The earth melted.
[time=2902] Verse 8, "Come behold, the works of the Lord.
[time=2904] What desolations he hath done in the earth.
[time=2906] He makeeth the wars deceased to the end of the earth.
[time=2908] He breaketh the bow.
[time=2909] He cuteth the spear and sunder.
[time=2911] He burnedeth the chariot and fire." Can I tell you the end of the story of Hezekiah and Sianakarib?
[time=2919] Hezekiah prays, Isaiah prophesies, and the people turn to the Lord.
[time=2925] And then Missouri goes back to the camp of Sianakarib, and that great Assyrian army prepares itself for battle the next day.
[time=2932] But in the night, the scripture said, "The angel of the Lord fought for Israel, and not a man ever fought in the Assyrian army that night against Israel, for the Lord smote them." We don't know whether there was some type of infectious bacterial in their water, and they were poisoned.
[time=2951] We don't know the physiological means, but what we do know is that God fought for Israel, and God defended them.
[time=2958] Listen to the powerful way of poetry that Lord Byron has put this.
[time=2962] The Assyrians came down like a wolf on the fold.
[time=2970] And his cohorts were glittering in purple and gold.
[time=2975] But by night, the tents were silent, the banners alone.
[time=2983] The lances unlifted, the trumpets unblown.
[time=2988] The might of the Gentiles unsmote by the sword, melted like the snow with a glance from the Lord.
[time=2998] God fought for Israel.
[time=3000] And as he fought for Israel, they learned that there was a God who built about them a hedge of protection, and built within them a waters of provision.
[time=3014] So that when their stress exceeded their strength, they could sing a song, a song of life.
[time=3021] Our God is a refuge, a very present help in the time of trouble.
[time=3027] I don't know why God is sending a loss in family through one of the darkest valleys and hours of their life.
[time=3033] I have no idea.
[time=3035] I don't know what God's doing in your life, but I want to share with you what you might do as you walk through this valley.
[time=3044] A songwriter by the name of Gordon Jensen has written a beautiful song.
[time=3047] He writes many songs.
[time=3049] One in particular is called "Leave a Well in the Valley." And God may be taking you through some of the valleys in life that he might build into yourself a confidence that he can use you to encourage others.
[time=3064] Jensen writes, "Leave a well in the valley, dark and lonesome valley.
[time=3070] Leave a well in the valley that you go through 'cause others have to walk that valley too.
[time=3077] What a blessing when they find the well of joy you left behind.
[time=3084] Leave a well in the valley that you walk through.
[time=3090] It may be tonight today that God is taking you through a valley in the experience so that in the middle of that valley you'll learn something of the protection and the provision of God that you might be a well of joy for others.
[time=3108] Verse eight, "Come, behold the works of the Lord
[time=3114] "in the response of the people." In that third stanza of the song they are told to remember and beloved it is important that we remember the goodness of God, that we remember his provision and his protection in the past.
[time=3132] For it is one we observe that God has worked in our life in the past.
[time=3137] We begin to see in the valley that God has left wells for us to draw from as we walk through that valley.
[time=3144] And then he says the most difficult word.
[time=3148] He says, "Be still, be still." That runs contrary to my every instinct, to your every impulse that when stress comes down we want to double our effort and dig in and pour ourselves up our own bootstraps.
[time=3163] And instead of God saying, "Work." He says, "Be still, be still." And no, I am God.
[time=3173] Because it's not until we lay our hammers and our stalls down until we close the books and we silently listen and are still that we can begin to hear the music of God, the music of life, the songs that he would sing to us.
[time=3193] And when we're still and we're quiet the music begins to build in our ears.
[time=3200] And it says that we will know that he is God.
[time=3205] There are many words for know in the scripture.
[time=3207] There's a word to know by education that I've academically learned something.
[time=3212] There's a word which means to know by intellectual deduction or reasoning.
[time=3216] There's also the word which means to know by experience.
[time=3220] Yaddah, it's the word.
[time=3223] And know by the experience of this valley that I am God, from the ceasing from labor and worry and anxiety in the stillness of life that we allow the burden to roll off of our hands and to the lap of the Lord.
[time=3241] And we cast all of our care upon him.
[time=3244] It is then that we know the deliverance and the power of God.
[time=3250] Be still and know that I am God.
[time=3254] And then the song comes to an end with a great crescendo.
[time=3257] In music there is a crescendo, a song that starts off.
[time=3261] And each time it goes through a verse and a line, it builds and builds and builds to a great shout of acclamation.
[time=3268] This is a crescendo and the acclamation comes.
[time=3272] I will be exalted on the earth.
[time=3276] I will be exalted amongst the nations.
[time=3278] What God is saying that in the stress of life, that when we learn to know that he is God, that he demonstrates his power and that God is exalted in our midst, a song of life.
[time=3291] You know, we haven't yet talked about the single, most important word in the entire song.
[time=3297] It is word number three.
[time=3300] God is our refuge.
[time=3305] See, that is a personal pronoun.
[time=3307] A first person personal pronoun.
[time=3311] That says that this song is a song that belongs to me.
[time=3315] It's just not a song that we hear a choir sing.
[time=3318] It's not a song that a young man plays with a guitar or someone plays on there.
[time=3322] It is my song because he is my God.
[time=3326] And my God is my refuge.
[time=3329] Men and women today, it becomes a meaningless song.
[time=3333] If it's not a personal song.
[time=3335] If you do not first give your heart and your life to Jesus Christ, just say, God, I give you my life.
[time=3342] I belong to you and I take you as my refuge, my fortress, my strength.
[time=3349] God, I need you.
[time=3352] I open up my heart.
[time=3353] I throw the doors wide open to you.
[time=3356] Can you sing that song today?
[time=3358] I pray that you will.
[time=3359] Let us bow together in prayer.
[time=3362] Music of life.
[time=3365] The music of God begins when we open up our heart to Jesus Christ and we by faith invite him in.
[time=3372] Will you do that right now?
[time=3376] God.
[time=3377] You've been listening to Pastor Rick
[time=3396] here in the Convocation Center of the Black Law Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3400] And if as a result of his message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, we invite you to pray this prayer with us right now.
[time=3410] Dear Father, I realize that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ died to pay for my sins.
[time=3417] And I receive him right now as my own personal Savior.
[time=3422] I believe that he died for me and in my place.
[time=3425] And I transfer my faith from what I have been believing to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation.
[time=3433] Thank you for saving me.
[time=3435] In Jesus' name, I pray.
[time=3437] [AMEN] And if you prayed that prayer in your heart, you are trusting Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3444] The Word of God says, you are born again.
