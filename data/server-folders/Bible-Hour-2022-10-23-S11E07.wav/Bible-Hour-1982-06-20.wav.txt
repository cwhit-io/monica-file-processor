[time=42] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=44] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=51] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=63] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=68] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=79] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=89] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=97] We welcome you this morning to our Father's house to worship him, to honor him with our praise.
[time=102] When they extend a welcome, not only to you, those of you who are here today, but those of you who are joining us for the Bible Hour, we're thankful that you've invited us into your home to share with you the music and the message from the Word of God.
[time=116] Not many days from now, we enter into the time of the Fourth of July, a patriotic time, and we share a patriotic panorama.
[time=124] We talk about the freedom that God has afforded this country.
[time=127] But there's a far greater freedom than the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, the freedom politically.
[time=134] There's a freedom that you can know today in Christ Jesus.
[time=137] Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, "and the truth shall set you free, "and if the sun shall set you free, "you shall be free indeed." As we sing this morning of freedom, we sing of the freedom that's in Christ Jesus.
[time=151] Since the day of the Liberty Bell, the bell has often been a symbol of freedom.
[time=156] So our choir sings for us, ring all the bells of freedom.
[time=161] God bless you, and welcome to our worship services, our choir leads us this morning.
[time=169] [MUSIC] Ring the bells, ring the bells of freedom [MUSIC] Ring the bells of freedom [MUSIC] Strike them all and sing [MUSIC] Ring the bells of freedom [MUSIC] Sound them far and near [MUSIC] All they do, you'll ring the spring of hell [MUSIC] Ring the bells, ring the bells of freedom [MUSIC] All they do, you'll ring the spring of hell [MUSIC] Ring the bells, ring the bells [MUSIC] And the holy Lord [MUSIC] Christ the Lord in the hell [MUSIC] Ring the bell, ring the bell [MUSIC] Born to die and let light in [MUSIC] Ain't you and me like to be [MUSIC] Born of every one so long [MUSIC] Ain't you and me like to be [MUSIC] God the Father in his son [MUSIC] Ain't you and me like to be [MUSIC] Isn't it good [MUSIC] To ring and light his son [MUSIC] The Lord [MUSIC] Ring the bells, ring the bells [MUSIC] And the holy Lord [MUSIC] Christ the Lord in the hell [MUSIC] May his Son go [MUSIC] God the Father in his son [MUSIC] Ain't his only love in one [MUSIC] To this way, you can see no love [MUSIC] Ring the bell, ring the bell [MUSIC] Ring the bell, ring the bell [MUSIC] Ring the bells, ring the bell [MUSIC] Let the home and the home [MUSIC] Christ the Savior needs to pray [MUSIC] Christ the Savior's Son [MUSIC] God the Lord [MUSIC] Ring the bell, ring the bell [MUSIC] Ring the bell to hell [MUSIC]
[time=382] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=438] - Just the chorus together on the chorus.
[time=441] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=463] - Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=466] There are many beautiful names given for the Lord.
[time=468] He himself said, "I am that I am." Lenna Peterson comes now, and she sings some of those beautiful names of the Lord for us.
[time=479] The title of her song is, "I Am." (gentle music)
[time=503] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=705] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=708] We're always delighted to know that you're sharing this ministry with us.
[time=711] Don Krueger and I look forward each week to saying hello to you during these few moments in between the events of the Morning Worship Service to talk with you friends on television.
[time=721] Good morning Don.
[time=722] - How are you Rick?
[time=723] - I'm fine but I know I'm not nearly as busy as you are with the patriotic panorama coming up.
[time=729] - Well these are busy days and they're exciting days.
[time=731] We just finished a week of recording.
[time=734] The choir has been working very very hard on their music and in these next few weeks we'll be working on sets and preparation and costumes.
[time=742] You've been working hard on this thing too haven't you?
[time=744] - I better get working harder but yes I've been working hard.
[time=747] I'm looking forward to playing the part of a town crier and narrating this year's patriotic panorama.
[time=753] - I'm excited about it.
[time=754] I think it's going to be really very good too.
[time=757] - We want to invite you friends particularly who are in the Fort Wayne area to join us for this year's patriotic panorama.
[time=764] This is Blackhawk Baptist Church 9th annual patriotic panorama and we have tickets for you.
[time=770] If you would simply write to the Bible hour and enclose a self-addressed stomped envelope we'll be glad to send you up to four tickets for the eight o'clock performance of the patriotic panorama.
[time=783] Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=791] Again please enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope and we'll mail you up to four tickets upon your request.
[time=798] It's important that you write today or at least early this week so that we'll have time to get the tickets into your hands.
[time=805] There are a few left and it'll be on a first come, first serve basis.
[time=809] - Rick the Summer Bible Conference has really been exciting hasn't it?
[time=812] - It certainly has.
[time=813] We've had Dr. Whitcomb here who was one of my professors years ago and I've enjoyed his ministry.
[time=818] Have you?
[time=819] - Certainly have, people seem to really enjoy him too.
[time=822] The tendencies have proved that haven't they?
[time=824] - We've had a tremendous crowd come each week to hear Dr. Whitcomb speak on the Bible and science, how that God's Word is true and that the discoveries of science only confirm what we believe from the Word of God.
[time=836] He'll be with us one more week, this Thursday.
[time=839] Dr. Whitcomb will be speaking on the origin of human languages based upon the Tower of Babel in Genesis chapter 11.
[time=847] That will be an exciting time.
[time=849] This is Dr. Whitcomb's last week though.
[time=852] - You've been going to be doing a series in the Book of Psalms aren't you?
[time=855] - We've already had a few weeks in the Book of Psalms and we'll have some more studies there.
[time=860] - Talking about the Book of Psalms, here's a book that we're offering.
[time=863] We offered it last week.
[time=864] It's called Strength in the Time of Trouble.
[time=867] It's not a commentary.
[time=868] It's simply the new international version of the Book of Psalms.
[time=872] I know in times of stress in my own life, I have found the Word of God, especially the Book of Psalms, a source of real, refreshment and help in the time of need.
[time=882] And I'm sure many of you would enjoy this.
[time=883] If you'd like to have your copy of the new international version of the Book of Psalms entitled Strength in the Time of Trouble, just write to the Bible Hour.
[time=892] Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815 and we'll be glad to send you your copy.
[time=900] - Don, I don't know whether you know it, but the Book of Psalms was addressed to you because at the beginning of many of the Psalms, it says to the chief musician, the Psalms were a temple hymn book and God gives us a song to sing in the time of need.
[time=915] We want to share this booklet with you.
[time=917] We've shared a lot of things with you today.
[time=919] We want to invite you to join us for the Patriotic Panorama, also for the Summer Bible Conference and we mentioned Dr. Whitcomb only has one more week but following Dr. Whitcomb, we have our good friend Dr. Ken Nichols speaking to us.
[time=932] - We always enjoy Ken.
[time=933] He was a great crowd promoter.
[time=938] He usually says thousands and thousands of people have come and it's true, we haven't had thousands but we've had a very large amount of people.
[time=945] Usually the best attempt is when Dr. Nichols speaks and so that's going to be in the month of July.
[time=951] - And all July he'll be speaking on the Christians dealing with stress.
[time=955] He'll be speaking on the madness, the master and the manner and the law.
[time=961] And I never remember the last one.
[time=962] It's the management of stress.
[time=964] - And I want to usually say it's the music.
[time=966] - And it's not the music.
[time=967] It's the management of stress.
[time=969] You'll enjoy it.
[time=970] Join us on Thursday nights for the Bible Conference.
[time=973] Then write to us today for this helpful booklet, strengthen the time of trouble.
[time=978] Write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=985] - Just a few minutes we're going to be listening to some more special music.
[time=990] Lenna Peterson is going to be singing Dennis Kirschner, my wife and I are in the program today.
[time=995] And what is your message on?
[time=996] - Today is Father's Day here in Fort Wayne.
[time=998] I know those of you in South Bend in Chicago, it's two weeks past that.
[time=1002] We have a message today called The Priorities of the Man of God.
[time=1007] I trust you'll stay with us to study God's Word.
[time=1010] God bless you and have a great day.
[time=1018] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 131 seconds]
[time=1157] - Thank you, Don and Janet.
[time=1168] I know that's a song that each of us can put in our heart.
[time=1172] Some of you old football players can remember the fourth quarter when you wanted to quit.
[time=1177] When you played three and a half quarters, it's too soon to quit.
[time=1181] And God said that He's brought us thus far by faith and it's too soon to quit.
[time=1186] If faith is brought us safe thus far, then faith will lead us safely home.
[time=1192] That's a great hymn of the church called Amazing Grace.
[time=1195] That God's Amazing Grace will help us to finish the course until we come to heaven and we sing there for 10,000 years.
[time=1202] Dennis comes to lead us and worship this morning by singing for us Amazing Grace.
[time=1209] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=1227] Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound [MUSIC] That saved a rich like me [MUSIC]
[time=1247] [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=1342] [MUSIC] When we've been there ten thousand years [MUSIC] Bright shining as the sun [MUSIC] We've no last days to sing God's grace [MUSIC] Then when we first begun [MUSIC] Then when we first begun [MUSIC] Amazing grace, how sweet the sun [MUSIC] God's grace is amazing [MUSIC] It produces a sweet sound that carries our hearts [MUSIC] Even through the difficult valleys of life [MUSIC] There's a grace from God that can meet the need of each heart here today [MUSIC] We're thankful for a day called Father's Day [MUSIC] When we can take a few moments [MUSIC] And thank God for our fathers [MUSIC] And take the time to say that you have given to us a heritage [MUSIC] For which we thank you and we thank God [MUSIC] Men, you are called to be leaders not only in the community, but also in a home [MUSIC] And it's in our home that today we say thank you [MUSIC] I'm thankful for my father today [MUSIC] To send him a card, to call him, to talk to him [MUSIC] Wish we could eat lunch together today [MUSIC] We were not able to, but we'll see each other soon [MUSIC] And I'm thankful for my father [MUSIC] I trust today that each one of you will find a way to express that [MUSIC] But let us take a moment to bow before our God [MUSIC] And to give him thanks for the earthly fathers he's given to us [MUSIC] Father, we thank you today for the heritage and the example [MUSIC] For the love and the support that we've received from our fathers [MUSIC] That you've given to them the wisdom to guide us through our life [MUSIC] And Father, we thank you for them [MUSIC] We pray that we will be faithful sons and daughters [MUSIC] To the God that they have shared with us [MUSIC] For the example they've led, oh Father, we thank you for them [MUSIC] More than them, we thank you that you are God our Father [MUSIC] That we can come to you with the same confidence that we can go to our fathers [MUSIC] And Father, we now ask you to speak to our hearts [MUSIC] To use your word to teach us, to guide us, to strengthen us [MUSIC] Father, today we would want you to speak [MUSIC] We'd want to know your word, not simply the rhetoric of one human to an audience [MUSIC] But from the Spirit of God, to the heart of each man and each woman [MUSIC] For it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen [MUSIC] Let me invite you to open your Bibles with me if you will to do it around me [MUSIC] The sixth chapter [MUSIC] Recently a great deal has been said about fathers and anticipation of Father's Day [MUSIC] I often enjoy reading Father's Day cards [MUSIC] Probably nothing touched my heart more than a story that my wife shared with me [MUSIC] That came off of Good Morning America, Erma Bombak [MUSIC] The humorist analyst of society and life seems to have an ability with her humor [MUSIC] To say things that all of us have always felt but never been quite able to articulate [MUSIC] My wife shared it with me, the story is that Erma played with dolls when she was a little girl [MUSIC] Every day her dad would get up and he would go to work and she would stay home with her mother [MUSIC] And in her room she would play with her dolls and she had a daddy doll, a mother doll, and a baby doll [MUSIC] She knew what to do with the mother doll because she saw her mother every day [MUSIC] And she knew what to do with the baby doll but she really didn't understand what her father did [MUSIC] And so she simply put the father doll off to the side under the bed [MUSIC] Then one day her father didn't get up and go to work as he had done in the past [MUSIC] Her mother said to her that her daddy wouldn't be coming home anymore, that he had died [MUSIC] She crawled under her bed and picked up her daddy doll and hugged him [MUSIC] And wanted him back, oh so bad [MUSIC] Her father was gone [MUSIC] That's a tragic childhood story [MUSIC] But there are a lot of fathers who are gone [MUSIC] And it's something other than death that has taken them away [MUSIC] Men, where are you? [MUSIC] Are you there? [MUSIC] Or are you gone? [MUSIC] Where are men today? [MUSIC] In the homes? [MUSIC] In the churches? [MUSIC] In the community? [MUSIC] Men, where are you? [MUSIC] Do your children know you? [MUSIC] Do they understand you? [MUSIC] Or do they have to discard their father because they don't know him? [MUSIC] They don't know what he does? [MUSIC] Do your children know your values? [MUSIC] Do they know your priorities? [MUSIC] Have you left to them a heritage not only of an industrious father who knows what it means to work? [MUSIC] Have you also left with them a heritage of a father that loves God? [MUSIC] Has led them to that same relationship? [MUSIC] Men, where are you? [MUSIC] Are you there? [MUSIC] What ought the priorities of the man of God to be? [MUSIC] Where do we turn to in the word of God that spells out to us? [MUSIC] The starting point of life is men and as fathers. [MUSIC] I think there's no more powerful passage than all the scriptures than Deuteronomy chapter 6 verses 4 through 9. [MUSIC] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. [MUSIC] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might. [MUSIC] And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. [MUSIC] And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, [MUSIC] and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way, [MUSIC] when thou lieest down and when thou riseest up. [MUSIC] And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand. [MUSIC] And they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. [MUSIC] And thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house. [MUSIC] And upon thy gates. [MUSIC] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God. [MUSIC] This particular passage within the economy of the nation of Israel and the faith of the Hebrews, [MUSIC] during the Old Testament, was the single most important passage of the Bible. [MUSIC] Twice a day the dedicated Jew would recite this passage, not from the written page, but from his memory. [MUSIC] It was called the Shema, that's the Hebrew word the cow imperative to hear. [MUSIC] It's that word here, O Israel, Shema here. [MUSIC] It became the name for this entire passage because it simply doesn't mean listen, [MUSIC] it means to hear, to understand and to obey. [MUSIC] It was given with the sense of an authoritative declaration that was imperative to know and to carry out for life. [MUSIC] The Shema here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God. [MUSIC] That introduces us to a statement describing to us not only the person of God, [MUSIC] but the relationship we can have to God and our responsibility to God. [MUSIC] It speaks about a God in a description, a God who is completely unique. [MUSIC] A God who is one, and the idea there, yes, is the singleness of a number one, [MUSIC] but it is more than the unity of God. It speaks of the uniqueness of God. [MUSIC] There were many concepts of God, but Israel alone had a monotheistic concept of God for this point in history. [MUSIC] And their concept of God was greatly different than the people around them. [MUSIC] For they had many gods. Some of their gods were localized in that if you went into one geographic region, [MUSIC] you had a God for that country or that city or province. [MUSIC] And if you left that land and you went into a different city or province, [MUSIC] you came under the domination of a different God. [MUSIC] And so what pleased this God may not please this God, [MUSIC] and there was always a question as am I pleasing the right God. [MUSIC]
[time=1904] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1957] The scripture saying that our God is alone and unique is God, and that he is a sovereign God, and he reigns over all.
[time=1963] And his name is Jehovah or Yahweh, the Lord that is self-existent, controllable, he is God.
[time=1972] But within that description of God that he is unique and that he is sovereign, that he is powerful,
[time=1979] and also speaks of a relationship. For it says, "Hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God. [MUSIC]
[time=1994] He is not only a God who is of great power and uniqueness, but he is an intimate, and he is a personable, knowable God that he can be in a relationship with mankind. [MUSIC]
[time=2024] I will be as unto myself God, that God can reach down and to bridge that gap with forgiveness in Christ Jesus, and man can know God today. ♪
[time=2036] You can know God. There is a relationship that he offers there. And within that relationship, there is the responsibility. And this responsibility that is given is so unique to love God.
[time=2050] Most religion is born out of a fear of God, that if we do not please our God, then he is going to zap us. Therefore we live and we move in a fearful being, hoping that we please this God when we are in this territory, and this God when we are in this territory.
[time=2065] And you remember the story of the prophets of Baal, in their competition with Elijah, they called under their gods, and they were afraid they couldn't please their gods, so they tore off their clothes, and they actually beat their body, and they cut their bodies, pleading with their God to answer.
[time=2080] That what God wants. God wants us to beat our body, and is God some type of sadomasochistic God that somehow receives gratification to see us suffer and in anguish? Is that what pleases God, the fearful torment?
[time=2094] No, it's not what pleases God. It's what pleases God, boring religious observance. We come at nine o'clock, we stay until twelve fifteen. We endure everything for two and a half hour. We go home and have roast preacher for lunch.
[time=2110] And is that what God wants just these religious traditions and God's pleased? No, God's not pleased with your religion this morning. You may be a Baptist member of this. God's not pleased with your religion this morning.
[time=2125] What your relationship and responsibility is to God is to love him with your whole heart. And here we find the first priority of the man of God, one who is obsessed with love for God, a man whose heart beats after God.
[time=2144] That is the number one priority for a man of God. When Joseph came and he stood before Pharaoh and he unfolded for Pharaoh the meaning of his dream and he began to speak of how Pharaoh could plan for a famine.
[time=2158] Pharaoh said, "Where is there a man of God full of the Spirit of God to do these things?" And that may be the commentary that historians will write of this generation. Where is there a man of God full of the Spirit of God?
[time=2175] 8W toes are set at a generation of go. The need of this hour is twofold for men who are in love with God's word and men who are controlled by God's Spirit. The number one priority is to be a man of God.
[time=2193] In that term, Eshadunai, the Hebrew expression man of God is you so sparingly in the pages of the Bible. Aren't many men who are called Eshadunai, a man of God?
[time=2206] It's referred to of Moses several times and I'm intrigued by the fact that he is remembered for generations as a man of God, but there aren't many.
[time=2216] In the desire of my heart, more than to be the pastor of a large church, and I thank God for the opportunity to serve here, more than to be a part of a television ministry, more to be successful in the eyes of any man. The burden of my heart is to fulfill the priority to be a man of God.
[time=2235] The burden of my heart for you is men that you capture a love for God that consumes and burns within your heart, that you find the fulfillment of what the Apostle Paul said on Mars Hill. When he said in him, we live and move and have our being, that we are saturated with a love for God.
[time=2256] That love is described as a love that is all consuming, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy might.
[time=2265] The reference to the heart is primarily a reference to the inner man in his intelligence and his ability to choose and his points of discernment.
[time=2276] The word soul really refers more to the inner man and his appetites, his will, his choosings and his cravings. The word might refers not only to his physical strength and his energy, but his will, his determinate spirit, his aggressiveness, that which he pursues with tenacity.
[time=2294] But rather than a tricotomy, view of man, that this part of his heart and this part of his soul and this part of his mind and we are trying to figure out what each of these mean, what Hebrews understood by that expression, given by Moses, was that it was a reference to the total being, that my total being is to be consumed with the love of God, that he not only has a part of me and that he has a corner in my heart, but that my very being is consumed with love for God.
[time=2321] And in that consuming love for God, there is an overflowing that it dominates and it controls every aspect of my life.
[time=2331] Men, we've been given positions of leadership in our community, as businessmen, as civic leaders.
[time=2338] We're responsible in positions of management for the labor of others who are under us and we have great deal of significance in our role in life.
[time=2346] Some of us are users of our hands and with our hands we're able to produce the goods that keep the society fed and satisfied.
[time=2354] With our hands there is the ability to produce a product.
[time=2357] Others of us are involved in services.
[time=2360] My father is involved in service as a repairman and he has great value because of his ability to fulfill a need within a community.
[time=2368] But men, regardless of our occupation and what we can contribute to a society, we contribute little of value, no matter how noble and how humanitarian our hearts is, if we do not leave for society.
[time=2382] The obvious imprint that the Spirit of God reigns within our heart and that we love him with our entire being.
[time=2390] Verse 6 says, "These words which I command thee to stay shall be in my heart.
[time=2395] Not simply that we commit it to memory." That's purely intellectual to say, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one God, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all my life."
[time=2404] I've committed to memory. That's not what the passage is saying.
[time=2407] What he's saying is within the walls of our heart there is indelibly stamped a commitment to God's word and to him as a person that we love him with our whole being.
[time=2417] If we fall short in this priority, men, not much else matters, not much else matters.
[time=2426] But it's not only a priority, first of all, that we love God with our own heart totally, but that we pass that heritage along to our children, that we reproduce it in the lives of our family.
[time=2444] Verse 7, "And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children.
[time=2450] Thou shalt talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, when thou walkest by thy way, when thou lieest down, and when thou riseest out."
[time=2459] The Bible is telling us as men and as fathers that we are to reproduce as our responsibility, godliness in the lives of our children.
[time=2470] It's of tremendous value that your children are here this morning in this church studying in Sunday school.
[time=2476] I'm so thankful for Sunday school teachers and as my daughters come home each day from Sunday school they bring a little sheet and they're so proud of their papers and their projects and they're learning and I'm thankful for a Sunday school.
[time=2489] I praise God for a Christian school that takes education and subordinates it to the Word of God and it becomes a reference point for teaching where the role models of the teacher are believers committed to the Word of God and I'm thankful for that.
[time=2503] But a Sunday school and a Christian school are not a substitute for a father.
[time=2512] There's no substitute for you men in teaching your children the Word of God because it's not so much that you're teaching them academically but that you're teaching them through life.
[time=2526] Notice the description of how that teaching is done when you're sitting in your home. I don't know what that means sitting at the dinner table or sitting in the family room where there means sitting around the fireplace.
[time=2536] But what is saying within the walls of your house is the citadel of Christian education. You're to be a teacher within your home.
[time=2545] We teach our children many things. We have little ones and so we know what it means to teach a little one how to use a fork and to see or take that fork and to finally make contact with the chicken and actually pick and she gets it this far and she reads over the other hand picks it off and stuffs it in her mouth.
[time=2562] I'm not a very good teacher sometimes.
[time=2565] Seems that you spend the first year to year and a half of your life teaching your children to walk and talk in the next 17 to sit down and to be quiet.
[time=2574] And we're always in the role of teacher as parents.
[time=2577] We can teach our children how to use a fork out of walk and talk. We can teach them how to use their hands and repairing of things around the home.
[time=2585] We can teach them mathematics and help them with their homework. We can teach them athletics and I can remember catching the ball. I had to catch the ball 25 times.
[time=2594] We had a long backyard. My dad throw that. I had to catch it 25 times before we could quit.
[time=2599] I know sometimes he threw the ball over my head intentionally so I'd keep working out.
[time=2603] But he taught me a skill with my hands.
[time=2606] You may be teaching your children athletics and academics and mechanics and to use a fork and to walk and talk.
[time=2613] For not teaching God's Word, we failed at what God said is of priority, the man of God.
[time=2621] Within our homes, we are responsible. There's tremendous resource in the Sunday school.
[time=2626] There's tremendous resource in the Christian school, but oh beloved, those are not the substitute for the man of God that lives it day by day within the confines of his home as he sits.
[time=2638] Then it says, "They'll walk us in the way." It's really a reference to the fact that you don't leave your God in your home and that there's not a time that you depart from God.
[time=2646] But when you're traveling, the God just isn't something you talk about in the security of your home, but they take you into the marketplace of life.
[time=2654] And there your God is just as real and you teach your children how to live in a society with godliness.
[time=2660] But you see, it was common in these days to have terrafime. Terrafime were household gods, little statue gods that an individual had in their home and there they worshiped their gods and they left and they were out of their range and control of their God.
[time=2674] And it was a different life. And a man often took his gods with him if he needed the help of his gods.
[time=2679] There's a rather humorous story in the book of Judges how a man took another man's terrafime and carried them off and the man came to rescue his gods.
[time=2687] We don't rescue our God today, our God is our rescue earth.
[time=2691] And it's in him we find salvation and redemption in order to teach the value of knowing God and loving him to our children while we're sitting in our home, while we're walking in the way.
[time=2703] Then it says when they'll last down, when they'll rise us up.
[time=2707] It seems that the Bible would say, "When we get up in the morning, first thing, when we go down in bed, last thing, it's just they had a different economy of time."
[time=2715] The first thing to them was our last thing, the day began to them it sundown.
[time=2719] So when they lied down, God was the first priority of their day.
[time=2723] And when they'll rose up, God had given them rest and they were halfway through that day that God was still the priority of their being.
[time=2731] What he is saying is that you are consumed with God.
[time=2734] Now the very context of your life, God is being lived out.
[time=2739] And it's so important that we model that in our homes.
[time=2743] Someone has said that a young man does what his father says until he's 14.
[time=2748] And then he does what his father does.
[time=2751] That's not so important in what you're saying is what you're doing.
[time=2755] Someone said what you do speak so loud that I cannot hear what you say.
[time=2761] There's a rather tragic story of a man who failed to reproduce godliness in the life of his children.
[time=2768] Turn with me if you will for illustration to 1 Samuel chapter 2.
[time=2773] In 1 Samuel chapter 2 we meet several men.
[time=2777] Eli, the priest, two sons, Haphne and Phineas.
[time=2783] And there's an indictment made against Eli.
[time=2786] But in verses 12 through 17 we discover a particular sacrifice of the Hebrews that they were to come with a meat offering and it was to be boiled as a sacrifice unto the Lord.
[time=2797] And then along with a sacrifice being unto the Lord it was also to sustain the life of the priest
[time=2804] that the priest could come with a three pronged flesh hook and he could take one swipe into the boiled meat
[time=2810] and whatever came out that was his allowance.
[time=2813] Well Haphne and Phineas are two priests and what they do is they come and they take the meat before it's been sacrificed to the Lord.
[time=2822] That allows them some benefits. That allows them that they can take the choices part of the meat.
[time=2827] They don't have to reach in by chance. That allows them to take whatever amount they want.
[time=2832] It's not a hope you get a big piece this time.
[time=2835] It also allows them to cook it any way they want you because they thought boiled beef was a little bland.
[time=2841] And so they came and they took it and if the people weren't willing to give them the meat they took it by force.
[time=2847] And verse 17 it says, "Wherefore the sin of the young men Haphne and Phineas was very great before the Lord
[time=2854] for the men abhorred the offering of the Lord." You say where did it go wrong?
[time=2861] How could there be two priests in Israel that would hold the sacrifices of God but they would violate him?
[time=2870] Verse 27 of that chapter begin in indictment of Eli.
[time=2875] And verse 29 says, "Why trample ye upon my sacrifice and upon my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation.
[time=2884] And honor thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefess of the offerings of Israel."
[time=2893] Where did Haphne and Phineas learn that? They learned that from their father.
[time=2898] Eli other than this was a godly man.
[time=2902] But you see that particular weakness in his life spoke so loud that his sons could not hear what Eli had to say.
[time=2911] And their sin became more depraved than simply atrocities at the offering.
[time=2916] They began to take the young women who served within the temple and to commit immorality.
[time=2922] Where did it go wrong? Went wrong on a father honored his sons above his god.
[time=2931] And a man did not obey God and keep the sacrifice.
[time=2935] And the phrase "make us thyself fat" is so appropriate.
[time=2940] Because in chapter 3 we discover that when Eli hears of the death of his sons he falls off of his bench
[time=2947] and his neck is broken because "He was exceedingly fat."
[time=2953] When Eli learned that it was more comfortable to violate the statues of God, he passed that on as a heritage to his sons.
[time=2963] What are we passing on to our sons?
[time=2967] The priorities of a man of God, that the man of God first of all loved the Lord his God with all of his heart.
[time=2973] That he is a man of God. And secondly that he reproduced it in the life of his children.
[time=2979] Verses 8 through 9 in many ways are misunderstood.
[time=2984] It says, "Thou shalt bind them upon thy hand for a sign, thou shalt be as frontlets between nine eyes,
[time=2991] and thou shalt light them upon the post of thy house and upon thy gates." And so what the Orthodox Hebrew did was he took a leather locket and wrapped it around his wrist and hand
[time=3003] and inside that locket written on parchment would be hero Israel the Lord our God is one God.
[time=3009] And then tucked that parchment in the leather locket and they wore it upon their hands.
[time=3014] And then they took and they put a leather band around their heads and they wrote upon that leather band.
[time=3019] Hero Israel the Lord our God is one God.
[time=3022] And as they went into their host their posts and their gates they would put either in an inscription that same statement
[time=3028] or perhaps in a box nailed against the door there would be a scroll with the Shema this passage in it.
[time=3035] And they found fulfillment of the commandment of God.
[time=3039] To put it in the locket, wrap it around their head, put it on the post of their house.
[time=3045] Men and women that is boring empty religion.
[time=3049] What God was saying was stated first of all in verse six that it shall be in your heart that it's written upon your heart
[time=3057] and that becomes a very character of your life that it's borne out in the activities of your hand,
[time=3063] the thoughts of your head and the activities of your heart.
[time=3066] It's a tremendous observance that they would wear it upon their body.
[time=3070] But it became an empty religion when they failed to write upon the walls of their heart.
[time=3077] For you see God is a God of the heart.
[time=3082] He's not particularly impressed with our religious observance.
[time=3086] He's not overly concerned with what we wear in terms of religious insignias.
[time=3093] He's mostly concerned with what reigns within our heart and pours out in conduct and character in our lives.
[time=3100] And then secondly he's concerned that we reproduce that in the life of our children.
[time=3109] In the prize-winning book, "The Cane Mutiny" there is a character by the name of Willie Keith.
[time=3116] Willie Keith is serving on board a ship and he receives a word that his father is dying.
[time=3123] When the letter comes from his father he's encouraged not to come home because his father will die before he can ever get there.
[time=3129] And as his father closes the letter he says to him several things.
[time=3134] He asks him to remember him.
[time=3137] He also warns him of the priority and the value of time.
[time=3141] But then he said we never gave you much in the way of religion because we didn't have much ourselves.
[time=3151] I think perhaps I'll mail you a Bible.
[time=3157] Oh men don't let that be the commentary of our homes.
[time=3163] That in the twilight years of our life that we have to say to our children.
[time=3169] I guess I never gave you much of religion because I didn't have much of my own.
[time=3177] I think perhaps I'll send you a Bible.
[time=3182] I'm a young father. Some of you are older, your children are perhaps grown.
[time=3188] But the priorities haven't changed. They haven't changed.
[time=3193] First of all that you would be consumed with a love for God.
[time=3199] That you would have a passion for him that controls you.
[time=3202] And secondly that you would reproduce that within your family and in your children.
[time=3209] Leave a heritage.
[time=3213] I remember Bob back said she crawled under her bed.
[time=3218] She pulled her daddy doll out.
[time=3221] She hugged him. She wanted him back. Oh so bad.
[time=3226] Men are you there? Where are you?
[time=3232] Our father we bow before you in prayer. To say give to us a heart for you.
[time=3240] We might love you. Father is a father.
[time=3244] I ask you to strengthen my heart. I'm not all that I ought to be.
[time=3249] I pray that you'll give strength to the heart of each man who is a father.
[time=3253] A grandfather. To each young man before he becomes a husband or father that he'd know the priorities of God. We ask that you'd give us that vision.
[time=3265] And while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed.
[time=3270] Do you have that relationship with God? Can you say he is my God?
[time=3275] Do you love him with your whole heart?
[time=3278] Have you received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?
[time=3282] Well the priorities is impotent without knowing the God who has placed those priorities before you.
[time=3290] Are you confident today that you've given your heart to Jesus Christ?
[time=3295] Is he reigning within your heart?
[time=3298] Perhaps at this very moment he has spoken to you of your need for Jesus Christ.
[time=3304] Perhaps in a unique way, whether you're a man or a woman, you've heard today of the priorities that God has for your life.
[time=3313] And in those priorities there's a God that you don't even know.
[time=3319] You don't understand. You can come to know him today.
[time=3324] If you will simply by faith put your trust in him.
[time=3328] Throw open the door of your heart wide and invite him to come in.
[time=3334] God speaks to our hearts in a way that no human can.
[time=3338] And it could very well be this morning that God is speaking to you of your need for him.
[time=3345] Do you know Christ today? If not, I pray that you'll open the door of your heart and you'll let him in.
[time=3354] Father, today we pray for each heart that's here, that there would be surgery performed by the Word of God.
[time=3363] The Spirit of God would expose every heart's need that each man would truly know himself, that each young man would know his heart, that each young lady, each mother and grandmother today would know of their relationship with Christ.
[time=3379] Whether they truly have him in their heart or not, they would by faith open the door of their heart.
[time=3385] Oh Father, we pray that your Spirit would speak to hearts. For it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=3415] You've been sharing with Pastor Rick here in the Convocation Center, the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3425] And if, as a result of his message, you would like to receive Jesus as your personal Savior, we invite you to pray this prayer with us right now.
[time=3434] Dear Father, I thank you for Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world.
[time=3438] But today I believe that he is my Savior, and I put my faith and trust in him, knowing that he died on the cross for me and for my sins.
[time=3449] I transfer my faith from what I have been believing to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation.
[time=3456] Thank you for saving me in Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3461] And if you've prayed that prayer, we have a booklet we want to send to you. It's called Your Decision Booklet.
[time=3468] It will be a helpful guide for you as you take the first steps in your new Christian life and experience.
