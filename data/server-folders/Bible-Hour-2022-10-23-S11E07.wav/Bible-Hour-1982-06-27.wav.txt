[time=70] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=88] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=95] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=107] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=112] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=123] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=133] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=142] I mean you today and are thankful that you've joined us here for our morning worship service and want to say a special word of welcome to our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=153] It's a delight each week to have the opportunity to take the music and the message of God's Word beyond these walls into homes, hospitals, and prisons and to share how Jesus Christ can change lives if we will only open the door of our heart and invite a man.
[time=169] God cares for you this morning. He loves you.
[time=172] In spite of all the batarings and bruisings of life, there is someone who cares.
[time=178] Your friends may fail you, but God cares and he'll never forsake you.
[time=183] He'll stand with you by your side if you'll open up your heart and invite a man.
[time=188] Our choir sings for us that message this morning under the direction of Don Kruger, a great anthem of praise and invitation.
[time=199] â™ª
[time=208] I want Jesus in my heart
[time=214] more than anything this will get over me.
[time=219] For I know that He alone has sat His heart.
[time=229] Just to know that we're sleeping in my life
[time=235] is worth everything that I might sacrifice more than anything.
[time=250] Take the faith that I might want
[time=256] and all the things that seem so dear.
[time=260] I'd never have been when any grace
[time=266] has been given to me.
[time=271] I want Him to have control
[time=277] and be the breath of life in me.
[time=281] I'd rather have Jesus.
[time=284] I'd rather have Him than anything.
[time=292] As I go home to life within
[time=298] there may be no other way I want Jesus more than anything.
[time=314] He had now heard me again
[time=320] from the heavens he ruled the universe.
[time=326] Countless angels waiting on His every goal.
[time=336] But one day I saw Him all along
[time=342] the road of heaven and the light of Him.
[time=347] Just for Him is so good for the Christ He made.
[time=357] Take the faith that I might want
[time=363] and all the things that seem so dear.
[time=367] I'd rather have been when any grace
[time=373] has been given to me.
[time=378] I want Him to have control
[time=384] and be the breath of life in me.
[time=388] I'd rather have Jesus.
[time=391] I'd rather have Him than anything.
[time=399] As I go home to life within
[time=405] there may be no other way I want Jesus.
[time=414] O'er the heavy ring
[time=421] I want Jesus.
[time=429] And I trust that's your prayer.
[time=433] That you want Jesus more than anything this world can offer.
[time=437] Let's sing together now.
[time=438] We're going to use Him number two.
[time=439] Come Thou Almighty King.
[time=441] Those of you who are listening at home you join right along.
[time=444] I'm sure you know this beautiful old Him.
[time=447] Come Thou Almighty King, Him number two.
[time=452] Shall we stand now as we sing?
[time=457] Every voice.
[time=459] Come Thou Almighty King.
[time=468] Thou was I made to sing?
[time=474] Help us to pray.
[time=478] Under all warriors, for all victorious.
[time=485] Out of place.
[time=489] All thou in car in work.
[time=494] When all thy light be sore.
[time=499] Our prayer attune.
[time=503] All that thy people bless can be thy word success.
[time=510] [AMEN]
[time=519] Thank you for the good singing and you may be seated.
[time=523] Marley Nichols comes now and she sings another prayer.
[time=526] We just finished singing the choir that is the song I want Jesus in my life more than anything.
[time=533] And Marley sings fill me with Ice Spirit.
[time=565] Only fire.
[time=570] Your name with your kind and gentle love.
[time=580] Cloth me in humbleness is my desire.
[time=594] Only kindness and compassion
[time=600] are the seeds I want to sow.
[time=605] Oh, help me, dear Jesus, to accomplish my goal.
[time=615] Then lead me to someone that I can be friend.
[time=624] That I might share with others the spirit that you send.
[time=639] So fill me with your spirit,
[time=647] Lord, hurt me with your holy fire.
[time=658] Warm me with your kind and gentle love.
[time=668] Cloth me in humbleness.
[time=676] Is my desire.
[time=686] Fill me with your spirit,
[time=695] Lord.
[time=705] Hello once again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=709] We look forward to these few moments in the middle of our worship service to talk directly to you friends who join us for our television ministry.
[time=717] I have two good friends with me today whom I'm sure you know, Don Kruger, our Minister of Music and Dr. Ken Nichols, the Director of our Life Counseling Center.
[time=725] Good morning, men and welcome.
[time=727] Good morning, pastor.
[time=728] We are in the middle of the summer Bible Conference here at our church, and last month we had stirring messages about creationism and science from the Bible with Dr. John Whitcomb.
[time=739] But now July is coming upon us and during this month, Dr. Ken Nichols will be speaking to us, so I've asked him to join us today to share some highlights with you.
[time=748] Dr. Ken, what is the focus of your topic going to be during the July series?
[time=753] We would like to focus in on the area of stress for the summer series coming up.
[time=758] It seems to me that stress is one of the most difficult problems that people are dealing with today and has caused a great deal of physical and emotional and really spiritual problems, too.
[time=768] Well, as you approach it, I know you're going to be speaking here for four weeks.
[time=773] What are the highlights of your topic's going to be?
[time=776] Actually, four weeks seems such a short period of time to try to cover such an enormous topic.
[time=781] There are actually 8,000 formal systems now in the country of people suggesting various techniques to deal with stress and how to cope with it.
[time=790] What I would like to do is develop in the first lesson to illustrate for the people how powerful stress really can be in people's lives.
[time=798] And then secondly, I would like to try to develop a system that which illustrates for the people the manner of stress, meaning its strategy.
[time=805] How does it work?
[time=806] Through what avenues does it work in our lives?
[time=808] And then probably one of the most important lessons will be the area of management.
[time=813] This is where most of the literature is geared to today.
[time=817] In fact, as I prepared for the series of lessons, I ordered a number of books that are back-ordered because people are so interested in this topic.
[time=826] We want to use the Bible as an illustration on how to manage stress.
[time=829] And then finally, Rick, we want to illustrate to the people the idea that Jesus Christ is the master of stress and illustrate the principles from the Bible in order to cope effectively with stress.
[time=840] Well, that sounds exciting.
[time=842] Let me make sure I have it down.
[time=844] I want to speak first of all about the madness of stress and secondly about the manner of stress, how it works in our life.
[time=851] And then thirdly, the management of stress.
[time=854] And then finally, what was it again?
[time=856] The master of stress.
[time=857] And in that, we want to point to Jesus Christ, the master of stress, giving us the ability to master it in our life.
[time=864] Well, that sounds exciting.
[time=865] And each of us will be looking forward to those four messages.
[time=868] We'd like to invite you to join us.
[time=870] They'll be on Thursday evenings at seven o'clock here in the Convocation Center at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=876] Every Thursday at seven o'clock, our address is 7321 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=884] But July has five weeks in it, doesn't it?
[time=887] In terms of Thursdays, Don, what will be happening that fifth Thursday in July?
[time=891] Well, Pastor Rick, we've prepared right in the middle of the summer a tremendous concert and we chose the sunlight quartet to be our special music for that time.
[time=900] They've been in our church before and have really ministered to our people.
[time=904] They're fine musicians and people will enjoy the concert, but they also minister tremendously to people.
[time=910] And that's going to be on the 29th of July.
[time=913] So we're looking forward to that concert.
[time=915] I'm looking forward to that too.
[time=917] They've become, over the years of their ministry here, some of my favorite people.
[time=921] Their music has the ability to lift and stir your hearts and to give you a sense of joy in the Lord.
[time=927] We want to share with you some printed material that also deals with stress.
[time=932] This comes through our Live Counseling Center.
[time=935] Mr. Ed Ward, the Associate Counselor who works with Dr. Ken, has written a booklet entitled Distresses of Modern Living.
[time=942] Don, you have a copy of that.
[time=944] Yes, it's a helpful little guide.
[time=946] And it tells us what we need to know about stress.
[time=948] It describes what stress is and what are the causes of stress, the effects of stress, and some of the remedies of stress.
[time=956] It's a perfect little book for most people.
[time=959] Most people have some kind of pain and stress in their lives.
[time=962] And you'll enjoy reading this.
[time=964] This might give you some answers to your own particular problems.
[time=968] We'd like you to write to the Bible Hour.
[time=970] Box 15,000, 1500, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=976] And we'll rush to you your copy of the stresses of modern living.
[time=981] Well, that is a helpful little book that we've had them here for several weeks.
[time=985] Ed wrote them in the springtime.
[time=987] And I've appreciated it.
[time=989] And we want to share it with you.
[time=991] So we encourage you to write to us today at the Bible Hour.
[time=995] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=998] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1001] And these next few moments as we worship together, I'm looking forward to an opportunity to share with you a message entitled "A Song to Sing When Your Friends Fail You." From Psalm 55, I trust that it will be an encouragement to your own heart.
[time=1016] Don, what should we look forward to today musically?
[time=1019] The strictly feminine group, which we always enjoy, will be singing right after our insert.
[time=1024] And then you're going to have to put up with me.
[time=1027] Well, good.
[time=1028] We'll look forward to that.
[time=1030] Ken and Don, thank you for joining us.
[time=1032] And a special thank you to you for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=1036] In these next few weeks, we are busy trying to raise some of our financial needs.
[time=1041] And so I trust that you'll be praying for us.
[time=1043] And you'll consider being a part of the supporting family of the Bible Hour.
[time=1048] During these summer days, it is a special time of need.
[time=1052] As many people vacation and travel, and they're not in their regular cycles of life, and so often their regular cycles of giving are interrupted.
[time=1060] Please be praying for us.
[time=1062] And if God would lay upon your heart a way to help the Bible Hour, we'd so much appreciate it.
[time=1068] If today you'd like to send a gift or you would like the booklet, The Stresses of Living, right to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1080] God bless you.
[time=1081] Have a great day and stay with us now.
[time=1101] [MUSIC]
[time=1122] The eyes of God are upon me.
[time=1134] He sees everything I do.
[time=1146] The arms of God are around me.
[time=1155] They keep me safe.
[time=1167] And he knows where I am, every hour of every day.
[time=1175] He knows each thought I think.
[time=1178] He knows each word that I might say.
[time=1183] And though there were times I stepped out of his will,
[time=1193] I've never been out of his care.
[time=1205] This changing world allores me.
[time=1215] With war we sing, we withdraw.
[time=1226] But my loving Father, he chimes me.
[time=1237] With joy with peace and blood.
[time=1247] And he knows where I am, every hour of every day.
[time=1257] He knows each thought I think.
[time=1260] He knows each word that I might say.
[time=1265] And though there were times I stepped out of his will.
[time=1276] I've never been out of his care.
[time=1304] [MUSIC]
[time=1310] Thank you ladies.
[time=1311] The amazing thing of our God is not that he cares for his children, but that he cares for his children even when they care not for him.
[time=1320] God cares for you this morning.
[time=1322] You may come to an auditorium or be watching a television set and feeling that no one cares,
[time=1328] but no one really understands how you feel today, but God cares.
[time=1333] Not only does he care, but he invites you to come to him with anxieties, frustrations, fears,
[time=1339] tensions, strife and stress.
[time=1342] God cares for you this morning.
[time=1344] He wants you to take all of your anxieties and all of your cares and cast them, roll them on to him because he cares for you.
[time=1352] Don Krueger sings that song of God's care today.
[time=1358] [MUSIC]
[time=1376] Is there a heart bow down with sorrow?
[time=1385] Is there a life way down with care?
[time=1393] Come to the cross, your burden buried,
[time=1401] all your anxiety, leave it there.
[time=1411] All your anxiety, all your care,
[time=1420] bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.
[time=1428] Never a burden that he cannot bear,
[time=1436] never a friend like Jesus.
[time=1445] Is there a heart or bow by sorrow?
[time=1452] Is there a life way down with care?
[time=1460] Come to the cross, your burden buried,
[time=1467] all your anxiety, leave it there.
[time=1477] Oh, so are you weary and troubled.
[time=1483] No light in the darkness you see.
[time=1491] There is life for a look at the Savior,
[time=1498] and life more abundant and free.
[time=1505] Life that is free just turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1517] Look full in his wonderful face,
[time=1524] and the things of earth will grow strangely dim.
[time=1532] In the light of his glory and grace,
[time=1541] turn your eyes upon Jesus,
[time=1550] on the dream.
[time=1566] Thank you, Pastor Krueger.
[time=1568] Let us pray together.
[time=1570] Our Father, we come to you with our eyes turned towards you and our hearts listening, because there are burdens and cares that we carry.
[time=1579] And we want to exchange our cares for your peace.
[time=1583] And Father, we come to you today in remembering some loved ones that are in the hospital for Mrs. Hoffert recovering from surgery,
[time=1593] for Mark Lawson recovering from an automobile accident, for Jonathan Blecking recovering from a serious fall.
[time=1601] God, to know the hurt of someone that we love in pain, to know that there are those today who have lost loved ones in the recent weeks for families who have lost mothers and grandfathers, for individuals who have loved a mate for life, and now that mate has rejected them.
[time=1621] To know that there are those whose children are not walking with you, God, we come to you today with hurts and with cares.
[time=1628] We ask you to pick up the burden of our life and to walk with us.
[time=1632] To use your word today to strengthen our hearts, not only that we would have calmness, that we'd have confidence.
[time=1640] Use your word to speak to each heart in a unique way.
[time=1644] For it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1648] Allow me to open my Bible and invite you to open your Bibles to Psalm 55.
[time=1654] In these summer months we are studying the book of Psalms, selecting various Psalms on different topics.
[time=1662] Psalm 55 has been entitled, a Psalm, a complaint against false friends.
[time=1669] I've entitled today's message, a song to sing when your friends fail you.
[time=1674] Have you ever had a friend fail you?
[time=1677] Perhaps you've labored in a business, and you've been the number two man for years, and you've worked hard and that business is prospered, and the boss has gotten all the credit, but that's been all right. That's been okay.
[time=1691] But now the business isn't doing so well, the economy has had its imposition upon your business, and the company has troubles, and the boss needs to have a scapegoat, and he's selected you.
[time=1704] After all the years that you've made him successful, he now betrays you, and he uses you, and he takes all of the problems and paints them on your back, and you're sent away to bear the blunt of the failure.
[time=1720] A friend, a boss betrayed you.
[time=1724] Perhaps you're a businessman, and you came into some sharp investments, and you cut a friend on a good deal.
[time=1731] Excuse me, they mean to be so violent this morning.
[time=1735] You cut a friend in on a good deal, and as soon as he got a chance, he cut you out.
[time=1740] Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
[time=1743] Perhaps you're a freshman today, and you've really liked this little girl for a long time.
[time=1748] You quite haven't had the courage to go talk to her, and you sent your best friend to talk to her in your behalf, and that dirty guy asked her out, but not for you, for him, and he was your friend.
[time=1759] Have you ever been betrayed?
[time=1762] Have you ever trusted someone, and you've made yourself vulnerable to them?
[time=1766] You had a hurt in your heart, and they were your friend, and you opened up your heart, and you told them, and they betrayed that trust, and they told it out of context.
[time=1776] You've ever been let down, you've become vulnerable by a friend.
[time=1781] Perhaps you've invested your life with a mate, and that mate has been obstinate and difficult to live with, and you've reshaped your priorities and your values, and you've tried to be agreeable, and now in the middle of life, you've been abandoned.
[time=1796] You feel used and discarded.
[time=1800] Have you ever felt like the people that you're closest to have failed you?
[time=1805] Have you ever felt betrayed and alone?
[time=1809] David did.
[time=1811] In Psalm 55 he writes a song, and in his song there are three verses, and there is a very naturalness about his singing today.
[time=1821] David doesn't come to us with initial triumph.
[time=1824] He comes to us with some rather human responses, but in the end he has a resolution about the confidence that we can have in God.
[time=1833] When our friends fail us.
[time=1835] In verses one through seven, he gives to us verse one the song of retreat.
[time=1843] And then in verses eight through fifteen, he gives us the song of revenge.
[time=1850] And then in the last verses 16 through 23, he gives to us the song of resolution, of resolve, a song of life, a song to sing when your friends betray you.
[time=1864] Verses one through seven.
[time=1866] Give ear to my prayer O God, and hide not thyself from my supplication.
[time=1872] Attend unto me and hear me.
[time=1874] I mourn in my complaint and make a noise, because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked, for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
[time=1886] My heart is very pained within me.
[time=1889] The terrors of death are fallen upon me.
[time=1893] Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and whore hath overwhelmed me.
[time=1899] And I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove, for then I would fly away and be at rest.
[time=1907] Low, then would I wander far off and remain in the wilderness."
[time=1914] Silla.
[time=1916] David gives to us his first reaction to the discovery that he's been betrayed by a friend, that he's been disappointed.
[time=1925] And his first reaction is one of retreat.
[time=1928] And he retreats in two ways.
[time=1930] First of all, he retreats to God, which seemingly has the external shell of the positive move.
[time=1936] He retreats to God.
[time=1938] But isn't in his retreat there's a lack of sincerity and a lack of submission.
[time=1944] And as he comes to God, he comes saying, "Give your unto my prayer, O God, and hide not my face for my supplication." That's a common expression.
[time=1952] You could look those words out in the Psalms, and you'd find them time and time again.
[time=1956] And there was a ritual in us about David's prayer.
[time=1959] It was almost a prayer that said, "Oh, great God of the universe, we beseech it." And a rather formal routine prayer that is, he comes to God, he comes with a formalness, a lack of sincerity.
[time=1972] But he also comes more than that with a lack of submission.
[time=1976] Beloved, when you're in life, betrayed, battered, and bruised, in spite of that, come to God with a submissive spirit.
[time=1986] And there's a lack of submission in David as he cries out the God.
[time=1991] And he says, "Attend unto me, God, and hear me." What he is saying is he is addressing God, and he's saying, "God, you better help me." God, listen, don't you understand what's going on?
[time=2003] God, I am in trouble, bail me out now.
[time=2006] David was right, he was in trouble.
[time=2009] He described this problem.
[time=2010] He said, "My enemy is all around me.
[time=2012] They're wicked, and they're casting iniquity.
[time=2014] They're casting evil in front of me.
[time=2016] They're baiting me for a trap.
[time=2018] God, you better get me out of this one now.
[time=2020] Father, attend it.
[time=2022] Take care of it." Well, there is always the priority in going to God.
[time=2027] When David's retreat, there's something lacking, sincerity, and submission.
[time=2033] He'll discover those principles later in the song, but in his original retreat to God, there comes an impetuous one, a demanding one, insisting that God act and telling God how he ought to act.
[time=2046] But then David retreats in a second way.
[time=2049] He retreats into fantasy.
[time=2051] Fearfulness and trembling, verse 5, come upon me.
[time=2054] And whore hath overwhelmed me.
[time=2056] And I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove." Then I would fly away and be at rest.
[time=2066] Have you ever wanted to escape from your problems?
[time=2068] Do you ever wish that you were like a dove?
[time=2070] You could just fly away.
[time=2072] You could be gone and you'd never have to face the problems again.
[time=2075] Each of us have different fantasies of how we can escape our problems to have the wings of a dove.
[time=2083] Some people, when they have pressure and stress and worry, they lay up at night.
[time=2087] They cannot sleep at all.
[time=2089] One of my escape mechanisms is sleep.
[time=2092] And I've got problems and I've got bad news.
[time=2094] I can sleep and I'd prefer to sleep forever.
[time=2096] If the news is really bad, I'll fall asleep while you're telling it to me.
[time=2100] That's my escape.
[time=2102] You know, there's always a desire that when we're confronted face to face with a problem, we want to escape.
[time=2107] We want to get our wings and fly and go away.
[time=2111] You know, oftentimes I want to escape back into childhood.
[time=2115] This past week I saw some young boys about 8, 10, 12.
[time=2118] I'm not sure, but they're riding their bikes.
[time=2120] Boy, I went back 20 years.
[time=2123] I stopped and I thought, "Boy, remember that brand new three-speed bike I had?
[time=2128] Young people, they didn't have 10 speeds back then." Some of the racers did, but nobody in our neighborhood had a 10 speed, but the three-speed bike was really something.
[time=2136] I'd get on my three-speed bike and I'd ride up to Eisley's.
[time=2139] You don't know what an Eisley's is, but an Eisley's is an old ice cream milk parlor.
[time=2144] We could take 15 cents, one nickel and one dime.
[time=2147] You could go in, you could get two scoops of rainbow ice cream, big ones on a cone.
[time=2153] And I saw those boys and I said, "Boy, I'd love to go back 20 years." What I wish that all I had to do today was to get on my three-speed bike and ride up to Eisley's.
[time=2161] It was an air condition, but if you sat right next to the refrigeration tanks and you left them open a crack, it was nice and cool and eat your two scoops of rainbow ice cream.
[time=2171] Did you ever want to escape back into childhood?
[time=2174] Did you ever wish that the problems of your life or someone else's that you could just get on your three-speed bike right away?
[time=2181] David knew those feelings.
[time=2183] It's so natural to want to retreat.
[time=2186] And David said, "Oh God, I wish I was like a dove.
[time=2188] I could just mount up with my wings and I could fly away." He said, "Then I'd fly into the wilderness.
[time=2193] God, I'd find some remote corner of the earth where no one would ever find me." And there I'd nestled down between a rock and another, and God only that I could fly away from my problems.
[time=2206] There's almost an asking of God, "God, let me escape.
[time=2210] Get me out of here." And there was a retreat into fantasy and the want and the desire to escape and to be gone.
[time=2220] The first verse that David sings for us is a song of retreat.
[time=2226] No doubt David could remember when he was just a young lad.
[time=2229] He was a shepherd.
[time=2230] That was a position of responsibility.
[time=2232] But it was a position of security because David knew what it was to be a shepherd.
[time=2238] Now he wants to retreat back to those same hills, that same wilderness to get away from the problems of a kingdom, the problems of a family, the problems of an economy.
[time=2249] He said, "Oh, to retreat, just to go, to run will be gone." Beloved, if you're fighting today in life, life doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be.
[time=2261] It's very natural for you to want to retreat, to want to run away, to withdraw, to hide to be gone.
[time=2269] But don't stop singing at the end of verse 1.
[time=2273] Then David gives to us a second song.
[time=2276] He sings for us the song of revenge.
[time=2280] Verse 8, "I would hasten my escape from the windy storm in tempest.
[time=2284] Destroy, O Lord, and confuse their tongues, for they have seen violence and strife in the street.
[time=2290] Day and night they go about it upon the walls.
[time=2293] Mischief also, and sorrow are in the midst of it.
[time=2296] Wickedness is in the midst thereof.
[time=2298] Deceit, guiled, the part not from her streets.
[time=2302] For it was not an enemy that reproached me.
[time=2304] Then I would have borne it.
[time=2306] Neither was it he that had hated me, that did magnify himself against me.
[time=2311] Then I would have hidden myself from him.
[time=2314] But it was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, my familiar friend.
[time=2319] We took Sweet Council together and walked into the house of the Lord and Company.
[time=2324] That death sees upon them and let them go down alive until shield.
[time=2329] For wickedness is in their dwellings and amongst them." David begins to describe the adversary that he faces.
[time=2337] He said, "God, it's not my long time enemies.
[time=2341] It's not the host of the Philistines that have camped about Israel generation after generation.
[time=2346] It's not a goliath of gath that comes and taunts before me.
[time=2351] God, it's not been an enemy. It's been a friend.
[time=2355] It's been a counselor. It's been someone that I've trusted and I've asked advice and they've given good advice.
[time=2361] It was mine own equal, like a brother.
[time=2364] God, it was someone that I used to walk into the temple with and worship and bow down before you.
[time=2370] He said, "God, that's the one that failed me." Beloved, it is far more painful to be rejected by someone who we love than it is to be rejected by a stranger.
[time=2381] Far more painful.
[time=2383] David cries out describing how this friend, familiar one, betrayed him.
[time=2389] Beloved, it does hurt from someone who you trust, betrays you.
[time=2393] There's an agony there.
[time=2395] When we name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, there comes with that name, a demand to walk in character.
[time=2402] And here was a believer in the Old Testament who betrayed.
[time=2407] David knew the hurt of trusting someone as a fellow believer to be betrayed.
[time=2414] And the more he thinks about this, the more he reverberates in his mind and rehearses, the more angry he becomes and begins to strike out with vengeance.
[time=2426] And he sings a song of revenge.
[time=2430] Verse 9, "Destroy, O Lord, and confuse their tongues.
[time=2434] For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
[time=2437] Day and night they go about the walls.
[time=2439] Mischief also sorrow." Listen to how he describes that violence, strife, mischief, sorrow, wickedness, deceit, and guile.
[time=2447] What's he speaking of?
[time=2448] He's speaking of his own son, Abson.
[time=2452] We cannot say with 100% authority the context of this song, but it seems so best to fit into David's experience with Absalom and the Hith of Phil.
[time=2463] Absalom was the son of David.
[time=2467] Absalom had a half-sister and a half-brother.
[time=2471] And in this polygamous relationship of David, there were born many children.
[time=2476] An Absalom's sister is attacked and raped by a half-brother.
[time=2482] Absalom in revenge strikes and kills his half-brother.
[time=2487] And for fear of his father, the king, he runs and he hides in the wilderness.
[time=2493] And for days the court of David is saddened and dark.
[time=2497] And a counselor comes and begins to make repair between the relationships.
[time=2502] And David takes Absalom back into his court and has his beloved son.
[time=2508] And there's been forgiveness.
[time=2510] And now Absalom, the forgiven son, goes into the gates of the city where the judges hold their meeting and he listens to the people complain.
[time=2519] And Absalom speaks up.
[time=2521] He says, "You're right.
[time=2522] Things aren't so good.
[time=2524] As a matter of fact, they're not going to be very good as long as my father, David's, on the throne.
[time=2529] But if I was on the throne, things would be different.
[time=2535] Things would be different." Absalom was crafty.
[time=2538] He knew that no matter who was on the throne, there would always be opposition.
[time=2542] And he went and he made promises of appeasement to the dissidents.
[time=2547] And David could see it mounting in his own city, Jerusalem.
[time=2551] But also Absalom went to his hometown of Hebron and there in the streets, in the cities that David would live in,
[time=2557] he would see the strife, the mischief, the rebellion and insurrection beginning to mount.
[time=2563] And it angered him and it hurt him because it was his own son Absalom.
[time=2568] And Absalom took, as his counselor, Hithafil.
[time=2573] The man who for years had been David's consulare.
[time=2577] The man who David had trusted and days gone by has now turned and betrayed him.
[time=2583] And Hithafil has joined Absalom.
[time=2587] But David should not have been surprised because he was a deceitful man himself and his deception was coming back to get him.
[time=2597] For Hithafil, who had loved David in early years, had a granddaughter, her name Bathsheba.
[time=2606] Shakespeare said it well when he said, "Oh, would it tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive?"
[time=2613] No doubt, Hithafil was embittered by the treatment of his granddaughter and of his grandson in law.
[time=2620] Uriah the Hittite.
[time=2622] And so his friends now forsake him.
[time=2624] They betray him.
[time=2626] And David is left strangely alone as king over Israel.
[time=2630] And as he begins to rehearse, how kind he had been to them.
[time=2634] Now he had forgiven Absalom and this forgiven one turns in to a rebel that he cries on.
[time=2640] He said, "Oh God, destroy and confuse their tongues." He was saying, "God, destroy their plan.
[time=2646] Don't let their counselor, don't let their wisdom work out." And David plotted himself and he sent a man by the name of Hushai and who she was a counselor of David into the camp of Absalom.
[time=2656] And there Hushai said that he was against David and he listened to their counsel and he gave a counter-counsel
[time=2662] that made Absalom the lay in battle when he could have won and then David could regroup and defeat.
[time=2667] But David said, "Oh God, don't let their plan work destroy their plan." But he even became more angry.
[time=2675] In verse 15 he not only said, "God, destroy their plan." He was so full of vengeance and hatred and bitterness.
[time=2681] He said, "God, destroy them." He said, "Let death seize upon them and let them go down alive into hell."
[time=2691] Into shield, into the grave.
[time=2693] He said, "God, destroy them." His bitterness and his hate had come to the point where the only song that he could sing was one of bitterness and hate and destruction.
[time=2703] Is it natural?
[time=2705] Yes.
[time=2706] Is it right?
[time=2708] No.
[time=2709] You know the word of God talks to us in reality.
[time=2712] It doesn't talk to us in dreamy ideals.
[time=2714] God addresses us as men and women.
[time=2717] And some of the natural responses are first to want to run away, to retreat.
[time=2722] And then when retreat seems impossible, revenge becomes our new song.
[time=2729] David began to sing those songs, but a beloved don't stop singing with revenge.
[time=2735] Notice verse 16, "As for me I will call upon God, and the Lord shall save me."
[time=2744] Evening, morning, and noon.
[time=2748] Why pray and cry aloud?
[time=2751] And he shall hear my voice.
[time=2753] Do you notice the difference in temperament between I will pray, evening, morning, and noon?
[time=2759] I will cry and he will hear compared to the demanding of verse 2.
[time=2764] Attend me and hear me.
[time=2766] God, you listen to what I tell you and then God, you do what I ask.
[time=2770] Verse 2, verse 16.
[time=2773] Now he sings the song of resolution.
[time=2776] He's resolved in his own heart to trust in God.
[time=2780] So he says, "I'll come to God, and I'll come to him with a new spirit.
[time=2784] And I'll come in the morning, I'll come in the evening, I'll come in the noon.
[time=2788] What David is saying is, "God, I'll come to you in prayer, and I'll submit to you.
[time=2793] I'll submit to you." And then he says, "He will hear, he will answer." Why?
[time=2802] Verse 18, "He hath delivered my soul and peace from the battle that was against me, for there
[time=2808] were many with me.
[time=2809] God shall hear and afflict them, because he who by death of old."
[time=2815] What was David saying?
[time=2817] He was saying that God will take care of this problem, because God had taken care of it in the past.
[time=2823] Do you know it's so important that when you stand in the middle of a crisis to look into the past, and to see what God has done for you in the past, and God said God has delivered
[time=2834] me in the past, and David said, "I can trust him today." There was a song of resolution that he began to sing, and then he balances back one final
[time=2844] time to describe the hurt.
[time=2849] Verse 19, the middle of the verse, "Because they do not change, therefore they fear not God, he hath put his hands against such that art peace with him, he hath broken his covenants.
[time=2861] The words of his mouth are smoother than butter, but war was in his heart.
[time=2865] His words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords." What he is saying is that there was a time with this friend when they stood face to face
[time=2876] and they made a covenant of peace.
[time=2878] They had been at enmity, but now they had made a covenant of peace.
[time=2882] And in that time of making a covenant, there was a smooth talk.
[time=2887] There was a sincere external shell.
[time=2891] But while the words were saying peace in the heart, it was saying war.
[time=2896] And while the words were flowing out that seemed so smooth and satisfying as oil inside
[time=2902] the heart, there were drawn swords.
[time=2904] And while Absalom came back to his father's court, forgiven, and made a treaty of peace
[time=2910] with his father, his heart was not right.
[time=2914] And he was planning at that very moment insurrection and rebellion.
[time=2919] But David had come to the point where when he rehearsed at this time, he did not come out with revenge.
[time=2926] He came out resolved in three ways.
[time=2929] First of all, he resolved to cast the problem into God's hands, verse 22, "Cast thy burden
[time=2937] upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee." Actually, that word cast does not mean to pick up and to throw.
[time=2944] It means to actually move by rolling.
[time=2947] You know, most of our burdens in life aren't so small that we can just flip them away.
[time=2951] If we could just flip them away, we wouldn't need to know the song that we're studying today.
[time=2957] But our burdens aren't light little pebbles that we flip away.
[time=2960] They're not just irritations that get between our sock and our shoe.
[time=2964] They're burdens that weigh down our back.
[time=2967] It seems that we can't stand it anymore.
[time=2969] That's what David is saying.
[time=2971] "I'm pushing.
[time=2972] I'm rolling my burden over the lap." He said, "I'm resolved to put it into God's hands, and I'm confident that he'll sustain
[time=2979] me, that he'll uphold me." And David's resolution was that he could trust God with his problem.
[time=2985] And he took it out of his plans of conniving, escapes, and retreats, and fantasies, and
[time=2991] vengeance.
[time=2992] And he said, "God, I'll roll it over to you." And secondly, he was resolved that God would give him the ultimate triumph.
[time=3004] Verse 22, "He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved." David discovered that if he would now order his steps and he'd live in righteousness, that God would not allow him to be moved or to be removed, that God would ultimately give him the triumph.
[time=3020] Do you know that today you may be battered and bruised, but if you'll order your steps and walk in righteousness, that God will sustain you and he'll not allow you to be moved
[time=3032] or to be removed unless he himself wants you to be moved?
[time=3037] That if God has placed you somewhere and he wants you there, if you'll walk in righteousness,
[time=3043] you'll be there.
[time=3044] The ultimate triumph is yours if you'll cast your burden in the Lord and then secondly
[time=3050] be resolved to walk in righteousness.
[time=3053] David knew what it was to walk in righteousness.
[time=3056] He also knew what it was to walk in disobedience, and he knew now that if you would walk in righteousness that God would not allow him to be moved, that he would ultimately triumph.
[time=3067] But you know that in every battle of life, in every relationship that has tension, there's always a point where it seems that you're about to be overwhelmed.
[time=3076] You're about to be wiped out.
[time=3078] God won't allow you to be wiped out if you'll walk in righteousness.
[time=3083] Then thirdly, he was resolved to allow God to be the judge.
[time=3088] He said, verse 23, "But thou, God, shall bring them down into the pit.
[time=3096] Be in deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in thee."
[time=3104] Notice what he's saying?
[time=3106] Verse 15, he says, "God strike them." Verse 23 says, "No, God, you'll take care of them.
[time=3115] I don't need to ask you to strike back from my revenge.
[time=3119] God, you'll deal justly." He said, "Those who live that way will not live out half their days.
[time=3125] The Bible says that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword."
[time=3132] David loved his son, Absalom, but Absalom became the fulfillment of that.
[time=3136] Absalom lived by the sword, and the handsome young man died by the sword.
[time=3142] He died in battle, catching his hair in the tree as he rode by, hanging out.
[time=3149] He was put to death.
[time=3151] David was saying, "I don't need to be the vengeful one.
[time=3155] God is the just one, and I can be resolved in him to take care of it." You know, there's good resolution for us to apply there, to never feel that God wants
[time=3168] you to be your own judge, and God wants you to pass sentence on those who've wronged
[time=3175] you.
[time=3176] He'll do that.
[time=3177] There'll be the natural tendency for revenge, but God never will want you to be the instrument
[time=3186] of revenge to strike back.
[time=3189] Three verses of a song.
[time=3192] First a song of retreat to run away the song of revenge, the strike back, the song of resolution
[time=3202] to trust God.
[time=3203] Beloved, you're not going to escape problems today, you're not going to escape broken relationships, you're not going to escape being misunderstood.
[time=3211] You're not going to escape the betrayal of a friend.
[time=3215] The question that you have then is, "When I'm betrayed, when I'm hurt, what song will
[time=3222] I sing?" Will you sing a song of retreat?
[time=3225] Try to fly away.
[time=3226] Well, Americans love to fly away.
[time=3229] When you sing the song of revenge and say, "I'll get back, I'll strike that one," they
[time=3235] hit me, and I'll hit them the same way.
[time=3237] Oh, you sing the song of resolution.
[time=3240] It says, "God, I'll cast my burdens upon you to sustain me.
[time=3245] God, I'll trust in you to give me the ultimate triumph, and God, I'll resolve to you the
[time=3251] right to deal justice that is not mine to deal." Let me close for you today with a poem.
[time=3261] It reads, "What can it mean?
[time=3264] Is it ought to him that the nights are long, that the days are dim?
[time=3269] Can he be touched with griefs I bear, which sadden the heart and whiten the hair?
[time=3276] Around his thrones are eternal calms and strong lad music of happy psalms, and bliss unruffled
[time=3283] by any strife, how can he care for my little life?
[time=3289] And yet I want him to care for me while I live in this world where the sorrows be.
[time=3296] When the lights die down from the paths I take, when strength is feeble and friends for sake, when love and music once did bless, have left me to silence and loneliness, and
[time=3309] my life song changes to sobbing prayers, and my heart cries out for a God.
[time=3316] Who cares?
[time=3317] A wonderful story of deathless love, each child is dear to the heart above.
[time=3324] He fights for me when I cannot fight, he comforts me in the gloom of night.
[time=3329] He lifts the burden for he is strong, he steals the sigh, and awakens the song.
[time=3336] The sorrows that bowed me down with, he bears, and pardons and loves because he cares.
[time=3345] God cares for you this morning, broken, battered, bruised, betrayed, God cares for you today.
[time=3355] What song will you sing?
[time=3357] Let us pray together.
[time=3362] These songs, the song of retreat, fly away.
[time=3368] The song of revenge, strike back, or the song of resolution to trust God.
[time=3376] You begin that walk by putting your faith and trust in Jesus Christ, by opening up your
[time=3382] heart to him and saying, "Lord, I know of my own failures, I know of my own sin, and
[time=3392] I acknowledge it, and I ask you to forgive me, and to come into my heart to be my Savior."
[time=3399] It sounds so simple that it seems unbelievable, but God is a God who wants to speak to us
[time=3406] in simple words that we can understand, and he simply wants you today to acknowledge
[time=3412] your sin, ask his forgiveness, invite Christ to come into your heart, and to be your Savior.
[time=3421] It's a personal decision, "I can't make it for you, beloved, if I could, I'd reach out from my heart to yours immediately, and I'd make that choice to open it up to Jesus Christ,
[time=3431] but it's a personal decision, and God only comes, or he's invited.
[time=3435] Will you invite him into your heart?
[time=3437] Will you throw that door open?
[time=3439] I know you don't know all that it means, but if you'll take that first step, Jesus Christ will come into your heart.
[time=3445] Will you open the door of your heart to him?
[time=3448] He's asking you right now.
[time=3450] I pray that you'll open it." Oh God.
[time=3458] You've been listening to Pastor Rick Hawks here in the Convocation Center of the Black
[time=3470] Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and if as a result of his message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3478] We invite you to bow now and repeat this prayer.
[time=3483] Dear Lord Jesus, I realize that I am a sinner, and I realize that Jesus Christ died in my place and for my sins.
[time=3492] Right now I transfer my faith in what I have been believing in to Jesus Christ alone for
[time=3499] salvation.
[time=3501] Thank you for saving me.
[time=3502] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3507] If you have prayed that prayer in your heart, you are believing in Jesus as your Savior and trusting him alone for salvation.
[time=3513] The Bible says, "Thou shall be saved." We have a little booklet entitled "Your Decision." It's a helpful guide to anybody who has recently received Jesus Christ as their Savior.
