[time=85] (bells ringing) Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=99] Each week, Pastor Rick Hawks and other great Bible teachers will share with you from the Word of God.
[time=106] They're preaching satters on God's biblical principles, not man's opinion, and will give you practical insight for your daily living.
[time=117] You will want to have a Bible handy as you listen to today's message.
[time=122] Included in today's service will be a family time when Pastor Rick Hawks and Don Kruger will share with you special information concerning the Bible Hour.
[time=133] Also on our program today, you will hear music provided by our Bible Hour musicians and our own sanctuary choir.
[time=143] Now here is Pastor Rick Hawks from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=151] We're thankful you're with us.
[time=155] We say a special word of welcome to our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=159] This is the Fourth of July and we have a patriotic panorama tonight, so our choir is going to share a portion of that with you to stir your hearts this morning.
[time=168] The Sturm to thank God for the land we have and to praise His name for the blessing that He has given us.
[time=174] Over 200 years ago, 56 men met together and signed a document pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.
[time=182] We'd like to tell you their story in a song.
[time=194] [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=241] Philadelphia, 1776.
[time=244] 56 men signed a new document.
[time=247] That parchment was to stand forever as a partnership between the living, the dead, and the yet unborn.
[time=254] We call it the Declaration of Independence.
[time=257] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=474] In the Pennsylvania State House,
[time=480] now called Independence Hall, the best men from each of our colonies sat down together.
[time=486] On June 11th, the committee was formed to call up a Declaration of Independence.
[time=491] We were going to tell our British father land no more ruled by red coats.
[time=495] Thomas Jefferson finished a draft of the Declaration in 17 days.
[time=499] Congress adopted it on July the 4th, 1776.
[time=503] That much is familiar history.
[time=506] Now, here's the documental fate of the heroic 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence.
[time=511] [MUSIC]
[time=516] Of the 56, few were long to survive.
[time=519] Five were captured by the British and tortured before they died.
[time=523] Twelve had their homes looted or destroyed by the enemy.
[time=527] Nine to the 56 died in the war from its hardships and bullets.
[time=531] Wealthy planner and trader Carter Braxton of Virginia saw his ship swept away from the sea and battled.
[time=537] To pay his debts, he sold his home and all his properties.
[time=541] He died in rags.
[time=543] [MUSIC]
[time=550] Thomas McKean of Delaware was so harassed by the enemy that he was forced to move his family five times in five months.
[time=558] He served in Congress without pay, his family in poverty and hiding.
[time=563] And Thomas Nelson Jr. raised $2 million on his own signature to provision our allies, the French fleet.
[time=570] After the war, he wiped away his entire estate, paying back the loans.
[time=574] He was never reimbursed by his government.
[time=576] He died bankrupt and was buried in an unmarked grave.
[time=579] [MUSIC]
[time=585] John Hart was driven from his dying wife's bedside.
[time=588] For more than a year, he lived in force and in caves and returned home after the war to find his wife dead, his children gone, and his property worthless.
[time=598] He died a few weeks later of exhaustion and a broken heart.
[time=603] John Hancock, one of the wealthiest men in New England, stood outside Boston one terrible night of the war and said, "Burned Boston, though it makes John Hancock a beggar burn." He lived up to the pledge.
[time=616] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=844] Thank you for that ovation of appreciation, and we are thankful for the opportunity God gave us to proclaim to a community the freedom that he has afforded to us.
[time=855] It would be important for us today to give God the praise and the glory, and to thank him for what he has given to us in this land.
[time=863] Our Father, we bow before you today thanking you for the heritage that we have, for the freedom that has been purchased for us, for the liberty that we enjoy that this morning we can meet in this auditorium, that we can worship you and praise you, for the freedom we have through the ministry of television to proclaim your word to a city and to a community and to a region.
[time=885] Father, we thank you for the heritage we have, that men found there was something worth living for and even worth dying for.
[time=893] Father, we thank you for the prosperity which you've given to this land, to the abundance of the goodness that God has presented to us.
[time=901] Father, you've given us much, and in your word you've said to whom much is given, much is required.
[time=907] So today we pray that you would teach your hearts to be faithful to you to serve you. You've given to us all that we have.
[time=914] We thank you for it, for this land, the heritage that we have, in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[time=922] Hello and a happy Fourth of July to those of you who are joining us
[time=929] in Fort Wayne. It's a few weeks past that date in South Bend in Chicago, but Don and I are sitting here this morning outside historic Independence Hall, at least a backdrop because today is the Patriotic Panorama here.
[time=942] We've been working hard, Rick, to present a program that we do every year called the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=948] This year the town crier, which by the way, who by the way is Rick, tells the whole story of our freedom and the men who paid the price of that freedom, and it happens all right here in historic Philadelphia.
[time=961] We've been having a good time practicing and I think the people are quite ready.
[time=964] I'm thankful that we can share with you part of it as we did just a few moments ago with the freedom singers and the sanctuary choir.
[time=971] I wish all of you could come be with us for the full day, but I'm thankful for the Ministry of Television that was able to give you a glimpse of the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=980] In many ways that's exactly what our television does.
[time=983] We can't bring every one of you here, but through television we can come into your home and we thank you for inviting us in and spending these moments with us today.
[time=993] We count on you as our dear friends to pray for the Ministry of the Bible hour, to encourage the people who are part of the ministry and also to support the ministry.
[time=1002] In recent weeks we've written to you asking you to prayerfully consider helping the Bible hour with a summer gift.
[time=1009] I trust that you've received that letter and you're praying about it, perhaps God's laying it upon your heart to support the Bible hour during these summer months.
[time=1018] We have a gift that we want to share with all of you whether you're able to help financially or not.
[time=1022] These are very difficult times in which we live and stress is something that each of us faces,
[time=1028] and Don has a little booklet to share with you about stress.
[time=1031] Well, Rick, this summer we've been emphasizing some of the things that happened to us emotionally that hurt us and some of the remedies.
[time=1039] Dr. Ken Nichols is in our summer Bible conference series and he has the subject stress
[time=1047] and he's been handing out books and not handing them out selling books.
[time=1051] And one of the little booklets that he's been selling and one that we're going to offer to you is one by Ed Ward.
[time=1056] It's called The Stresses of Modern Living.
[time=1059] You can get this just by writing to us here at the Bible hour.
[time=1062] It's a helpful little guide.
[time=1064] It talks about the causes of stress and some of the effects of stress.
[time=1068] And then the mental and emotional effects of stress on our minds and then the physical effects of stress.
[time=1076] Things that trouble us in our bodies because of the stress we have.
[time=1080] And yes, there are solutions in this little pamphlet.
[time=1083] All the problems we hear about but there are solutions.
[time=1086] The solutions for stress and it's a helpful little guide.
[time=1089] We want you to write to us here and we'll send you the stresses of modern living written by Ed Ward right to the Bible hour box.
[time=1097] 15,115,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1103] And we'll rush your copy of the stresses of modern living to you.
[time=1107] Well, Don, we're quite fortunate to have this team of men with Dr. Ken Nichols speaking to us on Thursday night about stress.
[time=1114] And you're certainly welcome to join us at 7 o'clock.
[time=1117] But if you can't be here in person or if you can, we want to share this booklet with you by Mr. Ed Ward who is a part of our staff and our counseling ministry.
[time=1126] And Ed is a fine Christian man, a capable counselor, and he spent a great deal of time researching the area of stress.
[time=1132] We'd like to send this to you as our gift.
[time=1135] We want you to write to us today right to the Bible hour box.
[time=1139] 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1141] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1144] Well, Don, we've heard the freedom singers in the choir.
[time=1147] Who else will we hear from musically today?
[time=1149] Well, right now we're going to be listening to Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=1152] We always enjoy them and they're just fresh back from the tour of the east.
[time=1156] And they'll be giving us a couple of the numbers that they're going to be singing in the patriotic panorama tonight.
[time=1161] Well, that's great.
[time=1162] Thank you again for joining us.
[time=1164] I'm looking forward to sharing a message for you out of God's Word.
[time=1168] From Psalm chapter 2, a song to sing when it seems that the world is falling apart.
[time=1174] This is Independence Day and we have a heritage for which we can thank God.
[time=1179] But we also with that heritage have a responsibility to obey Him.
[time=1183] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1185] We'd love to hear from you to send you our booklet on stress, or perhaps to hear from you that you're supporting us financially.
[time=1192] Once you write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15.
[time=1200] God bless you and have a great day.
[time=1222] [MUSIC]
[time=1227] My country teas of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
[time=1239] Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims bright,
[time=1248] from every mountain sight, let freedom ring.
[time=1259] Our fathers got to the author of liberty, to thee we sing.
[time=1272] All may our land be bright with freedom's only light,
[time=1280] protect us by thy might, great God our King.
[time=1292] [MUSIC]
[time=1298] America, America, that shed His grace on thee,
[time=1311] and crown thy good with brotherhood.
[time=1317] From sea to shining sea.
[time=1329] [MUSIC]
[time=1337] God bless America, land that I love, stand beside her and guide her,
[time=1351] through the night with the light from above.
[time=1356] From the mountains to the prairies, to the oceans white with home.
[time=1367] God bless America, my home sweet Lord.
[time=1389] From the mountains to the prairies, to the oceans white with home.
[time=1401] God bless America, my home sweet Lord.
[time=1441] Our prayer is that God should bless America, and yet we need to respond in obedience to His call.
[time=1451] Jesus is calling America, calling America, calling America to the home.
[time=1470] Jesus is calling America, calling the young and the old.
[time=1488] Back to the faith of our fathers, faith we need in these troubled days.
[time=1507] Jesus is calling America.
[time=1517] From the singing way.
[time=1530] Jesus is calling America.
[time=1540] All that His voice we would hear.
[time=1549] Jesus is calling America.
[time=1558] Some may heal no longer please.
[time=1567] Now while this time we must answer,
[time=1576] let His feet in repentance fall.
[time=1586] Jesus is calling America.
[time=1595] Won't you answer His loving call?
[time=1618] America, America, America, America, America, America, America.
[time=1640] This may be His final cry.
[time=1661] Thank you, Stephen Maria, and let us take the very serious prayer that they've sung for us to heart
[time=1667] and render our hearts before God.
[time=1670] Father, we've heard through the beauty of a song that you are calling a people.
[time=1675] You have blessed the land, and with that blessing comes the obligation of obedience.
[time=1680] Father, may we sense today as individuals not only that you are calling a nation, but that you are speaking to our hearts today.
[time=1688] As we open your word, we pray that you by the power of your spirit would apply to each heart and to the heart that doesn't know Christ, that that individual today might come to know of His love and His forgiveness, to the heart that's a believer but is not walking in obedience, that they would discover through your word that there is a demand and a punishment for disobedience to a nation that is known in its history, the blessing of God, but today as forsaken, Father, we pray today that you would speak to each heart.
[time=1718] For it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1722] In a study of the history of the United States, there are two rather contrasting schools of history.
[time=1728] There is the traditional historical mode which sees America as a good nation, always arguing its case from this concept of universal laws that God has decreed,
[time=1739] the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[time=1743] However, there is a group of historians called revisionists who look at American history not from the traditional model but from a new model, even a pro-English model which sees the United States as 13 immature rebellious colonies
[time=1757] and then begins to speak from a different role.
[time=1760] Well, there are within those two schools an application also of our understanding of God in history.
[time=1765] The traditional role says that God is a God of history and that America was blessed because the people of America were God fearing God seeking people
[time=1775] and the evidence to support that would be very numerous.
[time=1778] The Plymouth colony, as those men came ashore off the Mayflower, they came with a compact commitment to each other that they were going to establish a new settlement to the glory of God in the advancement of the Christian faith.
[time=1791] They were Puritans that came seeking religious freedom to worship God, that is part of our heritage.
[time=1797] However, it is only fair to say that on the other side that Georgia was not such a colony, that when George Oglethorpe received his charter from King George and he named the land Georgia, he didn't find too many anxious Puritans waiting to come to his land.
[time=1811] He didn't find too many anxious people of any kind, so he went back to England and got permission to take people out of prison and they could be set free from prison if they promised to come to Georgia.
[time=1822] Amazing fact of history is there are all kinds of societies that trace their ancestors back to those that stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock and nobody traces their ancestry back to the founding fathers of Georgia.
[time=1834] We have a rather different history. There are two sides to the story.
[time=1838] It's important that we realize that in the days of our founding fathers establishing the documents which govern our land, particularly the Constitution, that as they began in Continental Congress, that Benjamin Franklin rose up and he said these words.
[time=1853] Gentlemen, if it is not possible for a sparrow to fall without his notice,
[time=1860] is it conceivable that an empire can rise without his aid?
[time=1864] Let us resolve to bow before Almighty God in prayer each day.
[time=1868] And so our Congress was formed having been preempted with prayer.
[time=1873] But it's also fair to point out from the revisionist's school thought that Franklin and Jefferson
[time=1879] and many of our founding fathers were deists. They believed in God, but they didn't believe in a personal God that they could know.
[time=1887] They believed that there was a God who created a world, wound it up, set it in order, and then remained for the most part detached only an observer.
[time=1897] And so what is our heritage? Where do we stand at the crossroads of life?
[time=1901] How fundamentally Christian is our heritage?
[time=1905] How permanently committed to the values of the Word of God were our founding fathers?
[time=1911] Well, there is room for analyzation, for revisionist, but I think there are three things that we can argue
[time=1917] that were part of our history that cannot be denied, no matter what perspective you take.
[time=1922] First of all, our founding fathers in every corner were God-fearing men.
[time=1928] Whether they were deists, unitariness, Puritans, Separatists, Catholics,
[time=1934] every group of people that came were God-fearing men and women who believed in God in His sovereignty in this land.
[time=1942] Secondly, the founders of this nation held to a value of morality and integrity
[time=1948] that they understood well that immorality was a blight on society and that the nation who indulged immorality was a nation whose days were numbered.
[time=1959] Thirdly, they were men who held to the value of work more than the value of pleasure.
[time=1964] It's called the Protestant or Puritan work ethic, but it did not discriminate against the Catholic or the Jew.
[time=1971] It was simply a reminder that out of that Protestant Puritan ethic was the value that God honored hard work
[time=1977] and that we pleased Him with the labor of our hands and that God rewarded that labor with prosperity.
[time=1984] That is American history. Regardless of your view of history, that is what we hold to.
[time=1990] But really a lesson in history is not of great value because today we're in many ways at a crossroads.
[time=1996] We can choose to ignore our history. We do not have to hold to our heritage.
[time=2000] We had a revolutionary war in 1776. In this year we can have a cultural revolution and ignore our history.
[time=2009] So really, no history is only a value that it gives to you your ancestry, your roots and your heritage.
[time=2015] But each generation must make its own decision.
[time=2018] And today we live in a country with great turmoil in a world with great turmoil and there is a heritage that is missing and there is no sense of direction in our land.
[time=2029] Well, what do you sing? What song of praise do you have when the world is falling apart?
[time=2034] David gave us such a psalm in Psalm chapter 2.
[time=2038] And I invite you to turn in your Bible with me, if you will, to Psalm chapter 2.
[time=2043] A song of David about the ultimate triumph of God and his role over the earth of his wrath, but also of his love.
[time=2051] Today, America at the crossroads.
[time=2054] But it's important to realize that while we talk of America, nations do not make decisions for God or against God.
[time=2061] That's an individual decision that we can make only within the scope of our own heart, Psalm 2.
[time=2068] Why do the nations rage? Why do the people imagine a vain thing?
[time=2073] The kings of the earth set themselves up and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
[time=2082] "Let us break their bands asunder and let us cast away their cords from us.
[time=2088] Hugh, siteth in the heavens shall laugh. The Lord shall have them in derision.
[time=2093] Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his great displeasure.
[time=2100] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
[time=2105] I will declare the decree. The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my son.
[time=2111] This day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance.
[time=2118] And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
[time=2122] Thou shall break them with a rod of iron. Thou shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[time=2128] Be wise now, therefore, O you kings.
[time=2131] Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
[time=2134] Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son lest he be angry and you perish from the way when his wrath is kindled, but a little.
[time=2147] Blessed are they who put their trust in him." Psalm chapter 2.
[time=2153] It's a psalm that speaks about history, but it also speaks with a prophetic voice of the coming kingdom of Christ.
[time=2161] And within this historical prophetic psalm, there is instruction for us to heed today.
[time=2168] You can understand it best if we follow the outline, and I believe David had a clear outline as he spoke.
[time=2174] That this particular song of twelve verses can be broken down into four sections of three verses each.
[time=2181] Verses one through three speak to us of the anger of man in rebellion.
[time=2189] Verses four, five, and six speak of the anger of God in response.
[time=2196] Verses seven, eight, and nine speak of the anointing of God's king.
[time=2203] And verses ten, eleven, and twelve speak of the redemption of God that is offered.
[time=2211] It begins with two rhetorical questions.
[time=2214] Now a rhetorical question is something that a writer or a speaker says to an audience without expecting that they're going to answer and yell out from the back row with anticipation and enthusiasm.
[time=2225] This patient enthusiasm of a first grader reciting the ABCs.
[time=2229] But it is a question that is given so that people will begin to think, and it's a way of him introducing his own answer.
[time=2236] And so David begins with two rhetorical questions.
[time=2240] He says, first of all, why do the nations rage?
[time=2243] He says, why is the military political world in a raging, tempestuous balance like a sea driven by the wind?
[time=2253] Why is one nation rising up to smash another one and another one rising up in revenge?
[time=2258] Why is there subversion? Why is there clamor upon the earth?
[time=2262] Why on earth is this place falling apart?
[time=2265] David said, what on earth is happening?
[time=2269] And then secondly he says, why do people imagine a vain thing?
[time=2273] Why do people believe and contrive and meditate in their own heart that which is absurd and ultimately ridiculous?
[time=2281] So he begins to answer his own two questions in verse two.
[time=2286] He says, the kings of the earth have set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed.
[time=2295] What David is saying is that the kings of the earth have set themselves up.
[time=2300] They've appointed themselves. They have anointed themselves as Lord and King over the earth.
[time=2306] Did you know that in this point in history that many of the kings of the earth claimed to be God?
[time=2311] They took titles as God. They worshiped the God but claimed that they were the representative divine beings of God.
[time=2319] You know that story from biblical history that Nebuchadnezzarum made a God out of gold.
[time=2324] And he demanded that everyone bow down and worship him at the sound of the trumpet or any other musical instrument.
[time=2331] They had to bow down and worship at the statue of Nebuchadnezzarum, and if they did not, their lives were to be taken.
[time=2338] And so Daniel was thrown into the lion's den.
[time=2341] Well in this country we've seen the passing sarcophagus of Tutat Amun.
[time=2346] Tutat Amun was an Egyptian king who took his name from the God Amun, the sun god, and he said that he was the rays of the sun god
[time=2354] and that he was God in human form and he was to be worshipped.
[time=2357] However, there was somewhat of a change and the God Amun was replaced by the God Aten, so he simply changed his name from Tutat Amun to Tutat Aten.
[time=2367] And he claimed to be God and he was to be worshipped.
[time=2370] In tomorrow recent history of what we call modern history, you come to a point in history called the Pox Romana, the Peace of Rome.
[time=2378] Ten Roman emperors reigned in a time of relative peace, but in their reign they took upon themselves not only the emperor of Rome,
[time=2386] but the title Pontifus Maximus, the high priest, that they actually claimed to be a God, a human God, and demanded the worship of God.
[time=2397] And so what verse 2 is saying is that man has exalted himself to the very position of God and says, "I am my own God."
[time=2406] And then secondly, the answer to the rhetorical question is found in verse 3.
[time=2412] They've said, "Let us break bands asunder and cast away their cords from us." They said, "Let's not only do away with God, but let's break his control.
[time=2421] Let's develop our own standards of ethics, our own standards of worship, our own values.
[time=2426] Let us break God's restraint upon our life.
[time=2429] Let us live our own life according to our own values." Whenever a country or a people or an individual replaces their God, then they replace the values of their God.
[time=2443] In many ways, that is not only a description of history, it's an Afropro description today.
[time=2450] There are few men who stand up and say, "That I am God." That's too unbelievable to try to pass today.
[time=2458] But what has come about in our society is such a rise of humanism that we now say that man is the measure of all things.
[time=2467] That was said 400 years before Christ by a Pythagoras.
[time=2471] And now it is the motto of society that man is the ultimate standard.
[time=2475] There is nothing above him. There is no one to appeal to.
[time=2478] And therefore, man is his own God. He has to set his own standards.
[time=2483] And our values now are man-centered, anthropomorphic, man-centered.
[time=2489] God has been replaced by a man.
[time=2493] Now, who are the kings of the earth?
[time=2496] Well, in the times of the Bible, it was the two Ted Ottans.
[time=2499] In the times of the New Testament, it was the Diocletians.
[time=2503] But today, it is the scientist that holds that life can only be viewed in a closed system of naturalism.
[time=2510] And there is no outside force that can influence life.
[time=2513] Today, it is the philosopher that says to live is to live.
[time=2517] And there is nothing beyond mere existence.
[time=2520] Therefore, you must choose your own lifestyle so as will give to you a meaningful existence.
[time=2525] Today, the rulers of the earth are the advertising agents that assure us that everything that glitters is gold.
[time=2533] And you only have opportunity once to go around, so you better grab all the gusto you can.
[time=2538] Today, the rulers of the earth who have set themselves up are the musicians who drum beat out a consistent bombarding of only one message in its self-gratification.
[time=2549] Today, who are the kings of the earth?
[time=2551] There are those who exalt the fact that man is God and who establish their own standards, their own ethics, and their own morality.
[time=2560] And so man on earth rages in anger against God and against his control.
[time=2566] But beloved, the controls and the standard that God put upon life were not standards to limit our joy, they're standards to enhance it.
[time=2574] That as we live by the standards of God, we discover that his commandments are not burdensome.
[time=2579] But they are an easy yoke to bear and they give guidance to our life.
[time=2583] With the anger of man, we discover that there is an anger of God in response.
[time=2589] Verse 4, "He who siteth in the heaven shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.
[time=2595] Then shall he speak unto them with his wrath and vex them in his great displeasure.
[time=2600] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill." In his reaction of anger, God says and does three things.
[time=2609] First of all, the scripture says that when man exalts himself as God, he laughs.
[time=2615] He laughs at the completely ridiculous, ludicrous idea that a man is going to overthrow God.
[time=2623] In the year 245, a young man was born destined to become Emperor of Rome, his name Diocletian.
[time=2631] And during the later years of his life, he rained his emperor with great persecution of the cause of Christ, trying to absolutely eliminate the name of Christ and all Christians from the kingdom.
[time=2643] And at the time of his death, two monuments were built which stand in Spain today.
[time=2648] One of them says to Diocletian for expanding the empire in the east and the west and for ridding the empire of the Christians who caused its demise.
[time=2658] The other statue says to Diocletian, Emperor of Rome, for ridding the empire of the superstition of the name of Christ.
[time=2667] Diocletian died in 313 and those monuments were erected in his memory.
[time=2674] In the same year, God was still in control of history, that he grabbed and controlled the heart of a new emperor.
[time=2681] And in that same year, God laughed at the grave of Diocletian.
[time=2686] And the edict of Milan was passed and Christianity became Religio Licita, the legal religion of Rome.
[time=2694] And within one generation, Rome was formally a Christian nation.
[time=2699] Not necessarily in their values or in their ethics, but God laughed when a man said, "I'll wipe away the name of Jesus Christ."
[time=2707] And from heaven, there was a laughter and derision.
[time=2710] And in the year of his death, Diocletian was made amokery by the power of God and of his people.
[time=2717] Next, it says that God not only laughs, but he looks down and he speaks with wrath.
[time=2724] That God speaks with judgment, and when we discover the anointing of his son, we're going to understand what that judgment is.
[time=2731] But it's important to realize that there is within the anger of God a warning of the wrath of God.
[time=2737] Throughout the history of this country, there have been two points on history which we called the Great Awakening.
[time=2743] The verse came in approximately 1740 through the efforts and preaching of two men, George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards.
[time=2752] And Jonathan Edwards was famous for his hell, fire and damnation preaching, something that we find culturally anathema today.
[time=2762] We like to speak of God as a God of love, and he is, and beloved he loves you today.
[time=2767] In spite of what you or I may have done, he loves you today.
[time=2771] But the Bible not only says God is love, it also says God is a consuming fire.
[time=2777] And that's in the Old Testament and the New Testament alike.
[time=2781] And God speaks with a word of wrath.
[time=2784] But as Whitfield and Edwards spoke of a reformation and a revival, they demanded not only that God was love and that he be responded to as a God of love,
[time=2795] but they demanded that God was a God of justice and they demanded a response of obedience.
[time=2801] And a nation was awakened with a moral consciousness that many historians believe gave rise to the strength of the revolution.
[time=2810] One hundred years later, in the 1830s and 40s, the nation had entered into a time of moral backsliding.
[time=2818] And God raised up a man out of Pennsylvania, New York, a lawyer with eloquence and a stirring voice by the name of Charles Finney.
[time=2827] And Charles Finney spoke in all the major cities and he worked his way into the hinterland of the wilderness to such backwood desolate places as Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.
[time=2839] And in those wildernesses, he called the people to a repentance and a revival. And again, the demand was of obedience to God.
[time=2847] And out of that revival started by Finney.
[time=2850] There was born the modern movements that we now today look back in history as the great social revivals of the 1800s.
[time=2858] The revival of prison reform, the revival of an anti-slavery movement.
[time=2863] The revival of moral and ethical standards came when a people discovered that God not only demanded that they follow him in love but that they fear him and obey him because he was a God of wrath.
[time=2874] Now we come to the revival of the 1970s and 80s and the term born again as as common as the term in God we trust and equally meaningless.
[time=2884] It's just a word. Why is that? Because we do not know that God is a God of wrath who demands obedience to him today.
[time=2891] And God spoke not only a word of laughter. Don't think that was a word of laughter of humor. God was not laughing in humor. He was laughing and mocking.
[time=2901] Then he spoke a word of judgment. Then finally the third thing God did was he established his own king.
[time=2908] He anointed Jesus Christ as king and Lord overall. And so the next three verses seven, eight and nine speak to us.
[time=2917] And what it is is God has spoken to his son and now his son repeats back those words.
[time=2923] I will declare the decree the Lord hath spoken unto me. Now Christ is speaking.
[time=2929] Thou art my son this day of I begotten there. First God anointed to his son. And Jesus Christ was placed as king and Lord overall. God anointed him.
[time=2939] The name Messiah Old Testament, New Testament Christ means the anointed or the appointed one of God.
[time=2945] But not only did he anoint him, he gave to him an inheritance. He said this day I will give you the nations for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
[time=2956] God gave him an inheritance. That inheritance was lordship overall. But you know Jesus heard those same promises one other time in his life.
[time=2965] Do you remember it? It was when he went out into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. Satan offered him the same thing.
[time=2973] He said if you'll bow down and worship me, I'll give you the kingdoms of the earth.
[time=2978] That's important that you learn a lesson from that. God said to Jesus that he would give him his inheritance. Satan said I'll give you my inheritance.
[time=2987] And Jesus had to choose what voice would he listen to. Know today that Satan is a duplicator and that anything that God will offer you, Satan will attempt to duplicate.
[time=2998] He duplicated the inheritance offered to the Messiah and when God offers you liberty of the soul, Satan will duplicate it and he'll say God won't fulfill your life.
[time=3009] But this will, this philosophy, this pleasure, this experiment, this value, this will give meaning to your life when God said I'll give meaning to your life.
[time=3018] And Satan tried to duplicate the inheritance. But thirdly, God gave to him his instruction. They'll shall break them with a rod of iron. They'll shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[time=3030] And here we see the declaration of the judgment of God that when Jesus Christ ultimately reigns on earth he'll not only have the scepter of peace.
[time=3038] He'll have a scepter of iron and he will crush all who disobey and who live and rebel into him, nations and individuals alike.
[time=3046] And it's important that you realize that the judgment of God is as real as the forgiveness of God. His judgment can be described in these ways.
[time=3056] It is certain that God will try him. It is a certain judgment. It is also an irresistible judgment.
[time=3063] If you do not come to Christ when he comes to you, his judgment will be irresistible. There will be no excuses. There will be no places to hide.
[time=3072] It will be a fearful, dreadful punishment. You know that Jesus Christ spoke more of hell than he did of heaven.
[time=3081] There is not only a heaven to be gained. There is a hell to be shunned. It will be a complete judgment that God will completely judge everyone.
[time=3090] There will be none that escape. And finally, it will be irretrievable. It is too late when the judge comes.
[time=3098] But today, there is a final message in this psalm. There is the psalm of the offer of forgiveness and repentance.
[time=3105] Verse 10, "Be wise now, therefore, O you kings, be instructed, you judges the earth, serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling, kiss the sun."
[time=3118] "Lest he be angry with you, and you perish from the way. When his wrath is kindled but a little, blessed are they who put their trust in him."
[time=3129] God has described the rebellious anger of man. He has described his anger and reaction. He said that his son is anointed and he has been given an anointing and inheritance and instruction.
[time=3141] But God now offers forgiveness, redemption, and release. And he says, "First of all, learn. Learn. Beloved, if you can do anything today, learn from the word of God.
[time=3154] Learn from history and be wise. And do not think that you shall escape if you neglect so great a salvation as God affords.
[time=3163] This country will not escape the judgment of God if it does not learn to live like God's people.
[time=3170] We must learn. We must learn of the word of God. Secondly, we must not only learn, but we must serve him."
[time=3178] Joshua stood before the people and he told them the history of the God of Israel. He told them the gods of the land in which they would go in and he said, "Choose you this day whom you will serve."
[time=3188] Today, we stand at a point of choice. Will we serve the God of history or will we serve the God of our own society? Choose you this day whom you will serve.
[time=3198] Thirdly, we're called to submit. Whenever someone came to pay an homage and to submit to a king, they did that with a kiss of honor.
[time=3206] And so, the scripture says, "Kiss the sun, submit to him, lest he be angry." But beloved, don't miss within the judgment of God the goodness of God because it said, "Bless it, are happy as he who trusts in him."
[time=3220] You can put your trust in him today and discover that there is a God who loves you, who cares for you. A nation can discover of God who will shed blessing upon this land.
[time=3231] During the times of the Roman Empire, a man by the name of Julian was born in Constantinople. And Julian was raised with the values of Christ and in a Christian home as primitive as it was.
[time=3244] And Julian was destined to become the king and the emperor. He was the nephew of Constantine. But he hated Christ and he hated Christianity. And he would never even name the name of Christ. He only called him the Galilean.
[time=3257] And one day in rage, he pointed a dagger towards the sky and in bitterness cursed the Galilean. And he spent his life trying to wipe away Christianity from the Roman Empire. But he could not.
[time=3270] And as he went into battle against the Persians, he was wounded. And as he lay mortally wounded, blood upon him. He took his cloak, bloody as it was and threw it into heaven.
[time=3281] And he said, "O thou hast conquered, O Galilean." Jesus Christ will conquer. He will reign. And every knee shall bow. And every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of God.
[time=3297] The only choice that we have beloved is will we bow before him today, submit to him and serve him and call upon him for forgiveness and know the blessing and the goodness and the forgiveness of God.
[time=3310] Or will we live in our anger and our self-sufficiency and only know in the future of the judgment of God when it's irretrievably too late.
[time=3321] Choose you this day whom you will serve. But the Galilean will triumph. The question is only when. And only if you are willing and you surrender to him are if he conquers you. Let us pray together.
[time=3341] It's always more enjoyable to hear a message that speaks about the love of God, the forgiveness of Christ. To only talk about the positives, the beauty of heaven, the abundant life that Jesus Christ promises.
[time=3354] That's the good news. But you know we wouldn't be fair. And I would be guilty of not preaching the whole counsel of God if I did not tell you that God is a just God who demands obedience in your life.
[time=3369] And today you must choose. Will you serve him? Will you follow him? Or will you choose your own God? Will you be like the kings of the earth?
[time=3379] You have to make a choice. Oh that I could make a choice for you. Oh that I could make a choice for America. And somehow the decree of a pastor or even the decree of a president could make this a Christian land. It cannot.
[time=3393] We make this God's country only if and when we live like God's own people. But that demands that you and I give our hearts to him. Not only today to be born again but then to walk.
[time=3407] That our revival would bring about reformation of living. What our country had was a fear of God. They had a sense of morality and they had a sense of ethics.
[time=3419] Those come by the new birth in Christ if you'll grow in him. Will you today open up your heart and receive him a Savior? Will you follow him as Lord? I pray that you will.
[time=3431] Oh God you've been the voice that speaks to the heart. Man can only speak to the mind. But the Spirit of God can reprove the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment.
[time=3444] Father today we pray that you'll have your way in each of our hearts that there will be those today who surrender to the Son of God. There will be those today who have made professions of faith who will be bold and stand and make public that decision.
[time=3459] There will be those today who will be a part of a church to serve and to worship and to labor together. Father we'd want you to be glorified. We want you to be glorified in the response.
[time=3475] You've been listening to Pastor Rick Hawkes here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3481] And if as a result of his message today you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior we invite you to pray this prayer with us right now.
[time=3491] Dear Father I believe that I am the center and that Jesus Christ is not only the Savior of the world but my personal Savior.
[time=3501] I accept him as such today and pray that you will come in and cleanse my heart from all its sin.
[time=3508] I transfer my faith in what I have been believing in to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation and I thank you for saving me. In Jesus' name amen.
[time=3520] And if you've prayed this prayer and in your heart you desire to know more about Jesus Christ we have a little booklet. It's entitled Your Decision.
