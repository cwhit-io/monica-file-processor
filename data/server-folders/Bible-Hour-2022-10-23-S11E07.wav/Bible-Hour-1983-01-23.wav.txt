[time=15] And now let's see if we can sing the first answer without the use of our books and we'll sing it without the use of the instruments.
[time=21] Every voice together, all hail the power of Jesus, name, flesh and cross, faithful.
[time=34] Bring forth the royal diadem, and cry again, Lord almighty.
[time=66] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=73] We welcome you this morning, that great singing of all hail the power of Jesus, name, is the very purpose for which we've gathered today, that we might praise the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=84] We're so thankful that you've come out on this morning to worship and praise the Lord together in His house.
[time=90] We trust you are feeling a sense of welcome and delight.
[time=94] We not only want to welcome those of you who are here today, but also those who join us week by week for the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=101] It's a privilege in this land in these days to have opportunity to declare the Word of God and to sing praises to His name.
[time=109] Each Sunday morning, I look forward to the ministry of our choir.
[time=113] They seem to have the ability to take through music and transfer to us the very majesty of the name of God.
[time=120] The purpose for our lives as Christians is to glorify God.
[time=124] And the choir sings for us now, come Christians, join to sing the sanctuary choir.
[time=154] [AMEN] Come raise to Christ our King.
[time=161] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=168] Let all be blind and borns, give all his glory to us.
[time=176] His is his precious source, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=187] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=206] Hallelujah.
[time=237] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=255] I shall not end the spring, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=267] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=322] Hallelujah.
[time=337] Now let's take our hymnals and turn them to Him number 4, 64, and sing a prayer.
[time=344] O master, let me walk with thee.
[time=348] The songwriter has written the words, and let us use those words as our prayer as we sing this hymn.
[time=354] Shall we all stand together now as we sing?
[time=360] O master, let me walk with thee.
[time=368] In holy hands of service ring.
[time=375] Tell me thy secret, help me bear, the strain of time, the bread of sin.
[time=392] Help me a song of ours to rule, rise of me, bring me for our own.
[time=408] Take me away from me to say, when I am in the wrong way.
[time=425] Reach me like nations still in me, it was a deeper harmony.
[time=440] Be aware that we pray, sweet and strong, in trials that dry our throne.
[time=458] In hope that sends a shining rain, far out of you,
[time=468] does God be willing?
[time=473] It means that all we've got is still in thee.
[time=482] O master, let me win.
[time=491] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=494] Now I'd like you to listen to Crystal Hall as she comes and sings a song entitled, "He Made the Blind to See."
[time=501] Crystal?
[time=503] Christ made the blind and flesh to see, and brought redeeming sight to me.
[time=529] He healed the lame and made them whole.
[time=536] O praise his name, he saved my soul, I know the whole.
[time=547] He pierced the light and brought to me the nation's end.
[time=559] But, as I know, a charity, once I was blind, and I see.
[time=585] And perfect love and sympathy.
[time=591] Christ took to hear, and ran suddenly.
[time=598] Now I can know his grace and power.
[time=605] He walks with me each day, each hour.
[time=614] I know the whole.
[time=618] He pierced the light and brought to me the nation's end.
[time=630] But, as I know, a charity, once I was blind, and I see.
[time=659] Thank you, Crystal, for your ministry to us today, and the hope that we have, that our blindness will be turned to sight.
[time=669] There are many today who have two eyes, they have good vision, but they don't see Jesus Christ.
[time=675] It's our prayer that in this service that God would open your eyes, that you might see Jesus Christ, and all of His glory, and in all of His grace.
[time=685] What was about a year ago at this time that most of us were huddled in our living rooms, trying to keep warm, looking at the Bible hour, and there are about 20 or 30 of us in the auditorium.
[time=696] That was a unique experience, and I am thankful today that we're together in God's house, and He can send a blizzard on any Monday morning.
[time=704] That would be delightful, but I'm thankful we can be here on Sundays to worship together, to praise God together.
[time=711] We also have opportunity beyond Sundays to serve the Lord together.
[time=715] Inside your bulletin there are a variety of announcements that I would like to draw your attention towards.
[time=721] Inside it lists special activities for the senior adults, the high school, the college and career class, and I want to encourage you to look at the details of those information that you can be actively involved in the ministries for the age groups that you belong to.
[time=737] Also, our Wednesday evening is a time of prayer, an important priority of the church to be praying together.
[time=745] We also pray on Wednesday mornings at 6.30 if you can rustle yourself out of bed and rise early and join us, we'd love to have you.
[time=753] We have a good core of men that come together and pray, and it's been a real strength to each of our lives and to our church.
[time=760] And then as a church-wide family, we pray at 7 o'clock on Wednesday evenings and we follow that by a time of service, an evangelism in Sunday school, an choir and a Bible study, and we want you to be a part of that.
[time=773] Another opportunity of service that's listed in the bulletin is lifestyle evangelism, and there's one change.
[time=779] The change is that it's not going to cost $25, it's only going to cost $15, so that is good news that we're able to share with you.
[time=788] We are hoping to have between 40 and 50 people, and right now we have about 35, so there's room for 10 to 15 more, and we'd love for you to be in that training program.
[time=798] Learning how to be a bridge builder to your family, to your friends, to those people who you would love to see come to Christ, but you feel there's a barrier.
[time=807] How do you win those neighbors to Christ? This is an excellent program, we want you to be a part of it.
[time=813] If you'd like to sign up to be a part of that or more information, take your gold card inside your bulletin, turn it over to the blank side, and right on the back of it, lifestyle evangelism, and drop it in the offering plate as it goes by.
[time=828] Also in the bulletin it tells of opportunities for the weekend of oneness, please take advantage of all those forms of service that are available to you.
[time=837] Let me ask our ushers to come forward at this time to take their stations that we can receive our offering this morning.
[time=843] You may need to be sensitive, some of our choir people are just getting in the auditorium, and if there's an empty seat next to you, slide down so they can come in and worship with us now.
[time=853] Let's bow our heads and our hearts together, and we'll be led in prayer this morning by Mr. Nick Zulman, our flock deacon for group 2.
[time=861] Let us pray. Our Heavenly Father, indeed grateful to you for the privilege that we have this morning of assembling together for the purpose of worshiping you.
[time=871] And our Father, as we think about the gift that you have given to us through your Son, that you have made provision of eternal life to each one who will receive you where are so indeed thankful to you, Lord, for your love to us.
[time=885] And as we examine our lives, we realize, Lord, how unworthy we are of your faithfulness to us.
[time=891] Each and every good thing that has happened to us in this week and weeks past and this day, Lord, we know has come from you.
[time=899] And so, Lord, we are so thankful that we have this opportunity of just expressing to you in a tangible way, our love to you.
[time=907] We thank you that we can give a portion of what you have blessed us with back to you.
[time=912] So, Lord, it is our prayer this morning that you would take these monies, multiply them, bless them, and may they continually be used to bring honor and glory into your name.
[time=924] Thank you, Father, for not only what you have done for us, what you are doing, but most of all for what you are going to do for us, for it is in your name we pray. Amen.
[time=942] [MUSIC - 503 seconds]
[time=1467] Did you ever stop and consider that the one who has his hand on you, that the one who's squeezing you might be God himself, that God is trying to take your life and to so squeeze your life that it would produce strength out of weakness, the squeezing of life.
[time=1496] First chapter of second Corinthians begins to talk about being squeezed. Turn with me if you will to first Corinthians chapter, excuse me, second Corinthians chapter 1 verses 3 through 11.
[time=1514] Blessed be the God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all of our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted.
[time=1543] Are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings, which we also suffer.
[time=1570] Or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as you are partners of the sufferings, so shall you also be partners of the consolation.
[time=1588] For we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life.
[time=1605] But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but trust in God who raises the dead, who delivered us from so great a death and death deliver, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.
[time=1627] You also, helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
[time=1639] People of Corinth were people who knew what it meant to have their lives squeezed. There were many who came from a Jewish background, and they came to a point in their life where they had left their Jewish heritage and followed Christ.
[time=1655] That was significant not only because it represented a change in their religious faith, but for them it was a very denial of their culture. It was a denial of their heritage and it was a rejection of their family.
[time=1669] They became some of the most persecuted people, being rejected by their own family. Many of you today know that thought of rejection.
[time=1680] You come from a background. Your family has a tradition. From one generation to another, you went to a particular church, you attended a particular denomination.
[time=1689] Your family had helped build the church. One of the stained glass windows was given in memory of your grandfather.
[time=1698] You went to that church as a child. It was expected that your children would go to that church. It's expected that you would live in that church and die in that church.
[time=1707] And now you've come with this new concept of Jesus knowing, personally, and your family doesn't understand, and they criticize, and they're angry, and they strike out.
[time=1720] And their in new endo is that you have gone off the deep end. You've become a fanatic, and they're hurt.
[time=1729] They say that you're rejecting them. They feel like you're criticizing the way that they raised you. You're an adult now, but still hurtful to them.
[time=1742] That you've left the church of your fathers, so you're rejected.
[time=1748] And it seems that those times that used to be times of great joy and excitement, the holidays are some of the most pressure-filled days of your life, because you are now an alien in your own family.
[time=1765] Do you know that hurt? The Corinthians knew that hurt. Some of you know a different kind of hurt.
[time=1773] You've labored, you've done your best to perform well, but there's been a misunderstanding.
[time=1779] Because of your unique lifestyle, I mean, face it, men and women, following Christ today puts a demand on the lifestyle that is not completely compatible with our society.
[time=1790] And so in the sphere of influence of your labor and your work, you've been cast away, because your very presence made others disdainful, and you're cast out.
[time=1803] Perhaps you know the hurt of being falsely accused. Something has gone wrong, and the blame has been cast before you.
[time=1812] It's not true, but you're now bearing the punishment for something you didn't do, injustice. The Corinthians knew injustice.
[time=1822] Perhaps though you are physically suffering, in your own life, the word cancer is not a medical term, it's something that you live with, and perhaps something you'll die with.
[time=1834] Perhaps you have felt the tragedy that we can't even begin to empathize with.
[time=1842] The tragedy of a loss of loved one, perhaps the great tragedy of the loss of a child.
[time=1849] The Corinthians knew those hurts, and God writes to them a word of comfort.
[time=1856] It's been difficult days for our community, economically. Bridge collapses in Ohio just across the line, four people die, life is taken.
[time=1869] A young student in St. Louis, Missouri, feels that life is so full of pressure as an eighth grader that he takes a gun to school, and he shoots the two boys who've teased him, walks to the front of the room, puts the gun to his head, and says I can't take it anymore and kills himself.
[time=1885] Life is harsh. It's brutal. A woman comes home, someone breaks into her home, shoots her with a gun, burns her house down to cover the trail.
[time=1900] Life is brutal, and it's harsh. Does God know that? Does he really know the injustice and inhumanity? Yes, he does.
[time=1912] Life's not only harsh, but it just seems to be a hassle every day.
[time=1918] Some of you go to work every day, and your job in business and administration is just like being trampled to death by a flock of geese.
[time=1925] It's just one little problem after another waddles over you.
[time=1929] It just seems no sooner to get the things out of the inbasket and put them in the outbasket and the inbasket's overflowing again.
[time=1937] And your job is stressful. Maybe you've got a different kind of stress. You've got the stress of no job.
[time=1945] No, you would trade anybody the stress of their job for your lack of blood.
[time=1951] But maybe you have what is probably the most stressful job in our culture, the job of mother and housewife.
[time=1960] My sister has three children, five, three and two. Anyone that has three children, five and under, should have their heads examined.
[time=1969] And I know. I need my head examined.
[time=1974] My sister has on a refrigerator a perfect cartoon that captures the spirit of the mother in her home.
[time=1981] This cartoon pictures a lady with three children.
[time=1985] One of them has discovered a way of getting up on top of the counter opening the cabinets and the cabinets and checking out the fine China.
[time=1993] The other one has discovered that there's something very interesting at the bottom of that trash bag and the way to get to it is to turn it upside down.
[time=2000] And the third one sobbing is crawling up the mother's leg.
[time=2004] Here stands the more poor mother on the phone. She says, "Yes, I'm a working mother. What other kind is there?"
[time=2011] You ever feel like that? Not only is your world just pressure around you and you can't keep up, but someone has the audacity to say, "Do you work?"
[time=2020] I mean, what do you do all day anyway?
[time=2024] They look at your life with this blank stares, though you've got it made.
[time=2028] And you just wish you could cry out and tell somebody how life really is.
[time=2032] And some days you just want to say, "God, what are you going to do about it?" You know, there's someone that had those feelings. David, turn with me just as a way of finding empathy to Psalm 69.
[time=2047] David, the chief writer of the Psalms in Psalm 69, cries out to God because he feels like he's getting squeezed.
[time=2056] He feels like he's getting run over. Psalm 69, "Save me, O God, for the waters are come in unto my soul."
[time=2066] I sink in the deep mire where there is no standing.
[time=2072] I come unto the deep waters where the floods overflow me.
[time=2077] I feel like life has taken you by a flood.
[time=2080] The readers died, just really wanted to know the flood that it sits Fort Wayne. They would forget the Pemberton Dyke and they'd come look at your family.
[time=2086] They really wanted to know about a flood.
[time=2088] Do you ever feel like there's not one place for you to stand?
[time=2091] You go to work and it's stressed. You go home and it's stressed. You get in the car and it breaks down.
[time=2097] No place to stand. I mean, you just can't get, just surround you. It's a flood. You're going under.
[time=2103] They even knew that feeling. Verse 3, "And I am wearing a crying. My throat is dried. My eyes fail while I wait for my God."
[time=2117] He said, "God, not only is this place falling apart and the floods are taking me under God. I've cried to you so often.
[time=2123] My throat is raspy and raw and my tear ducts are empty. God, I'm waiting.
[time=2129] I've cried and I've waited and I've waited and I'm empty.
[time=2134] And they that hate me without cause." One of the things that's the most difficult thing to take in life is rejection.
[time=2145] When someone hates you and they hate you without cause. And David says, "They that hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs on my head."
[time=2155] David was probably a young man with a lot of hair.
[time=2160] They that would destroy me being my enemies wrongfully are mighty. Not only do they hate me.
[time=2168] God, these aren't little guys. These aren't little problems. These are mighty problems.
[time=2174] Oh God, you know the foolishness of my ways and my sins are not hidden from me.
[time=2179] David says, "God, I'm not trying to act like I'm innocent and I've never done anything wrong.
[time=2183] God, you know my sin, but God, this is unjust.
[time=2188] Let them who wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be not ashamed for my sake."
[time=2195] He said, "God, everyone in Israel who's trusting in you is looking at me.
[time=2199] And God, they're going to be afraid to trust you.
[time=2202] And when they see what happens to my life, when I trust you, God, they're going to be ashamed.
[time=2207] God, because of what's happening to me, don't let a whole nation of people be afraid to trust God.
[time=2215] Let those who seek thee be not confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
[time=2220] Because for my, no. Not because for my, but because for thy sake.
[time=2228] Thy sake have a born reproach and shame covered my face." You know what David was saying, that God somehow in this, I understand that it's not my stresses.
[time=2238] It's not my enemies, but it's you who have a grip on my life.
[time=2242] And it's for thy sake.
[time=2244] I'm the proverbial tube of toothpaste, getting twisted and wrenched.
[time=2250] But God, it hurts.
[time=2252] Verse 8, "For I am a stranger unto my brother and an alien unto my mother's children.
[time=2260] God, my own family won't have anything to do with me.
[time=2263] I'm an outcast.
[time=2264] I can't even go home." An alien.
[time=2270] "For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them who reproach thee are fallen on me." God, I know that it's because I'm following you that this has happened.
[time=2279] But God, I thought if I followed you, that you promised peace, contentment, fulfillment.
[time=2284] And when I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
[time=2291] God, when I got down, the more I wept, the more I fasted, the more I prayed, the more I repented, the worse it got.
[time=2297] And what happened to this little formula?
[time=2299] ABC asked to believe confess, and it's better tomorrow.
[time=2302] God, I mourned.
[time=2304] I wept.
[time=2305] I fasted.
[time=2307] And that was to my reproach.
[time=2311] And I made sackcloth also in my garment, and it became as a proverb to them, and they that sit in the gate speak against me.
[time=2319] You know what David's saying?
[time=2320] He says everywhere he walked in the city, people were murmuring, and they were talking about him.
[time=2324] But most hideous of all, listen to this.
[time=2328] And I was the song of the drunkards.
[time=2333] You know what that means?
[time=2335] That meant when the unbelievers, the reveling, carousing people of his day, got together for a party.
[time=2342] And when they really got half-cocked, you know what their favorite sport was?
[time=2345] Mocking, David.
[time=2349] You know what David had to say?
[time=2352] He said this, "Oh Lord, what are you going to do about it?"
[time=2359] Do you ever have days when you're mad at God?
[time=2362] You say, "God, what are you going to do about that?" Well, David wasn't the only one that knew those struggles and those trials.
[time=2369] The Apostle Paul knew those, and in 2 Corinthians chapter 1, he wrote to say that God is going to do two things about it.
[time=2376] The first thing that God's going to do about our trials and the pressures and the squeezings of our life is found in verses 3 through 7.
[time=2384] And it says basically this in a phrase, "God's going to comfort us." That God is going to comfort you.
[time=2392] In verses 8 through 11, it tells us the second thing that God's going to do.
[time=2397] Not only is God going to comfort you, He's going to deliver you.
[time=2402] He's going to rescue you out of the pit.
[time=2405] He'll deliver you.
[time=2407] Let's look at those two things in depth and we'll take them in that order.
[time=2411] Verses 3 through 7 tell us that God is going to comfort us.
[time=2415] And if you would look closely at verses 3 through 7, you'll discover that two concepts keep coming up again and again.
[time=2422] The first concept that keeps coming up is the concept of trials, tribulations, problems, sufferings, afflictions, the whole ball of wax.
[time=2430] Six times, listen to this, verse 5, excuse me, verse 4,
[time=2437] in all our tribulation, verse 5, for as the sufferings of Christ,
[time=2444] verse 6, and whether we be afflicted, verse 6, enduring the same suffering, verse 7, partakers of the sufferings, verse 8.
[time=2459] We were pressed out of measure.
[time=2463] You get the theme of this particular passage?
[time=2466] God's talking to us about trials and tribulations, and there's one particular word that gets translated three or four different ways, but there's only one key word that keeps cropping up, the best word for it may be tribulation, but let me give to you first of all the meaning of that word tribulation.
[time=2482] It's basic meaning is this, the crush to roll over.
[time=2488] You ever feel like maybe some of you have made homemade noodles, we make those in our fam, do you ever feel like you're a ball of dough and someone's just squeezing in there, flopped you down in the counter and they just rolled over?
[time=2498] That's what the word tribulation means, just to be roll over, back and forth.
[time=2502] It means to squeeze, to sow, crowd, and squeeze as the trample underfoot.
[time=2510] It means to be squashed.
[time=2514] It's a word that was used in a very real sense, in Mark chapter 3, when Jesus Christ, there's such a great multitude around it, one to come hear him, that the crowd began to literally squeeze in on him and he had to make his way of escape across the lake on a boat.
[time=2529] And sometimes life is like a great crowd that's squeezing in all around us about to crush us, to roll us over, to squash us.
[time=2538] And there we are, broken heap of humanity, crying out saying,
[time=2546] "God, what are you going to do about it?" That's the meaning of that word tribulation.
[time=2550] It's found commonly in the Bible, 55 times that word comes up and comes up again.
[time=2557] But there's something else you need to know beyond the meaning of that word.
[time=2560] You need to know the source of that word.
[time=2563] Look at verse 5, "For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us."
[time=2573] Did you ever feel like there are so many things that went wrong that somebody had to be behind all this and planning it?
[time=2579] Most of the time in we think it's our wives, but they didn't know anything about it.
[time=2582] You ever feel like somebody is playing this, this many things can't go wrong.
[time=2587] You're right.
[time=2589] I hate to tell you, man, it wasn't that dear, sweet wife who really loves you and who you usually vent your anger and frustration on.
[time=2597] Mothers, it wasn't that three-year-old.
[time=2599] Now they caused some of the problem, but they weren't really the ones that had to squeeze on your life.
[time=2604] You know who it was?
[time=2606] It's got himself.
[time=2608] Because you see, the sufferings that we endure are called the very sufferings of Christ.
[time=2615] They're called the sufferings of Christ.
[time=2617] Not only in this passage, but let me run down a few verses for you.
[time=2621] Colossians chapter 1 verse 24, Paul said, "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[time=2629] and fill up that which is behind you, the afflictions of Christ." Now you want to talk about a guy who really had a strange philosophy of life.
[time=2636] He said, "I'm a little bit behind in my suffering.
[time=2639] I'm not suffering much." And he was feeling badly.
[time=2643] He was a little bit behind the afflictions of Christ and my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church.
[time=2652] Paul warned the Christians early on.
[time=2655] Acts chapter 14 verse 22, he said, "Confirming the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith that through much tribulation shall we enter into the kingdom of God." Paul wrote again to the church at Thessalonica, 1 Thessalonians 3-3, and he said, "That no man should be moved by these afflictions." Remember what David said, "Lord, I am sinking.
[time=2681] There's no place to stand." He was about to get washed away.
[time=2685] God says, "No, that you don't be moved by these afflictions." For do yourselves know that we are appointed under these things.
[time=2697] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 21 says this, "For even unto where we called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow him."
[time=2710] But perhaps the phrase that best puts it together is back in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 10,
[time=2718] and it says this, "Always bearing about in my body the dying of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2727] that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in my body."
[time=2733] Where is it all coming from?
[time=2735] It's coming from God Himself. He's in control.
[time=2738] And He has said that our life and our calling is to suffer for Christ.
[time=2745] That was the third thing you need to know about these tribulations.
[time=2749] Strange as this may sound, they're almost always accompanied by a phrase of joy or hope.
[time=2757] Not despair, not frustration, not anguish, but they're almost always linked with a concept of victorious hope.
[time=2765] Enjoy. Look at verse 7, "And our hope of you is steadfast."
[time=2772] James wrote to a group of people and he said, "Count it all joy when you fall into various trials."
[time=2780] James 1, 2.
[time=2782] 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 14 tells us we shouldn't think a strange thing when our faith is tested.
[time=2788] We should count it joy, joy that we are worthy to suffer from the name of Christ.
[time=2796] Jesus said, "These things have I spoken to you why you are in the world.
[time=2802] For in the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world."
[time=2811] John 16, 33.
[time=2814] It's a strange truth, but God often says that there's a direct link between joy and hope and expectation
[time=2820] and victory and confidence with our trials and our tribulation.
[time=2825] Listen to what Paul said to the church at Rome, "In Christ whom also we have access by faith unto His grace,
[time=2832] in which we stand and rejoice in hope, and not only do we hope but we glory in our tribulations,
[time=2841] knowing that our tribulations work patience." Now there's a word that comes up so repeatedly here in this concept of trials and that we know what it means.
[time=2852] That God's going to squash us and strangely it's God Himself who's got the hand on our life
[time=2858] in the middle of all that.
[time=2860] There's this reoccurring thing that God says that we have hope, we have confidence, we have joy.
[time=2867] Well what on earth is there to hope about in a situation like that?
[time=2872] Here's what there's to hope about, the promise of God that He will comfort you.
[time=2878] You know those bad words, trials, troubles, afflictions, those words come up six times,
[time=2884] but there's another word that comes up ten times.
[time=2888] It's the exact same word translated in two different ways.
[time=2892] It's translated comfort, it's translated consolation.
[time=2897] Because God wants you to know that in that tragedy God's in control and He's got a plan of comfort.
[time=2905] Ten times the word comfort or consolation occurs.
[time=2909] What's the meaning of that word?
[time=2911] It's a rather interesting word.
[time=2912] Let me flash a little Greek on you.
[time=2915] The word for comfort means pera caleo.
[time=2919] Now pera means around, to be around, to be near, to be alongside.
[time=2926] Caleo means to call or to stand.
[time=2931] What the word comfort means is to call someone who's going to stand alongside of you.
[time=2938] That's the etymology of the word and it's used three different ways in the scriptures.
[time=2942] Paul often says, "I beseech you therefore, brother." You know that little word beseech?
[time=2946] It means I call you, I'm working with you.
[time=2950] I'm encouraging, I want you to listen to this.
[time=2954] Secondly, it means to exhort or to admonish, to teach in a corrective way.
[time=2961] And thirdly, as it means here, it means to comfort, to console, to have consolation.
[time=2967] It's a very old word.
[time=2970] The Greeks used it often.
[time=2972] Matter of fact, they had a whole philosophy of comfort and consolation.
[time=2976] A whole philosophy and system they built around it.
[time=2978] I think you'll find it rather interesting to hear some of their thoughts.
[time=2982] The Greeks said, "Here are the people who deserve comfort and consolation.
[time=2987] First and most importantly, those who have lost children or others who died early."
[time=2994] Those are the people most needing and worthy of consolation.
[time=2998] You know, I think that's really true.
[time=3000] We may not think about it, but all of us understand and expect that someday
[time=3006] we will have to bury our parents.
[time=3009] But someday we'll walk through that valley and we'll lay in a grave
[time=3015] and never see on this earth again a mother or a father.
[time=3021] But there aren't too many of us that expect that we'll walk to that same place
[time=3028] to bury our children.
[time=3031] And the Greeks said those were the people who hurt the most.
[time=3035] Secondly, those who they themselves were dying.
[time=3039] Those who had a sentence of death in their own life.
[time=3043] Thirdly, the elderly.
[time=3045] Those whose society has passed by and said you don't have any value anymore.
[time=3050] Thirdly, those who suffered separation, they've somehow been detached from their family
[time=3057] through separation.
[time=3059] Fourthly, those who have been, excuse me, fifthly, those who have been exiled, those who've been publicly banished, sent away from their homeland.
[time=3069] Next, victims of injustice.
[time=3072] And then finally, victims of misfortune, accidents, deafness, blindness, slavery.
[time=3079] It was how they saw the need for comfort.
[time=3081] Here's what they thought comfort should be.
[time=3083] They thought that the most significant and best way you can comfort someone is to be there, to stand alongside them.
[time=3091] To go visit them personally, not what you say, not what you do, not what you bring,
[time=3097] but that you go and you're there.
[time=3101] To stand next to them.
[time=3102] Actually, the word comfort in English is a Latin word.
[time=3105] Con means with, fortus means brave.
[time=3109] Therefore, it means to brave with.
[time=3111] Someone's going through a harsh time in their life and they have someone who is going to brave it with them.
[time=3117] Stand beside them.
[time=3120] Second way they had since they didn't have telephones, they said the next best thing to being there is to send a letter.
[time=3127] But then if you couldn't be there and you couldn't send a letter, then what the person should do to comfort themselves is to listen to music.
[time=3137] Congrave said that music doth have charms to calm the savage beast to twist the knotted oak.
[time=3145] Music. Finally, they suggested sleep and rest.
[time=3150] You know, they had a good concept.
[time=3153] They had some good priorities, but they didn't have what you and I have in the way of comfort.
[time=3159] Because you see, in the way of comfort, we not only have the concept of caring and compassion, but we have a unique source of comfort.
[time=3169] Look with me, if you will, at verse 3.
[time=3172] Blessed be God.
[time=3175] Even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, the God of all comfort.
[time=3185] Where's the source of comfort?
[time=3188] I can't begin to tell you how inadequate I am, how inadequate I feel to try to give comfort to someone else.
[time=3194] I can't bring comfort.
[time=3196] I can stand there.
[time=3197] I can care.
[time=3199] But only God can truly bring comfort.
[time=3203] He is the God of all comfort.
[time=3204] As a matter of fact, His very name is the comforter.
[time=3207] When Jesus warning His disciples that He Himself should die and that He would be departing from them, said, "I will pray the Father that He will send you another." Even the spirit of truth.
[time=3220] What name did He give to that other spirit of truth?
[time=3223] He called Him the comforter.
[time=3225] An etymology says that those are the same two words.
[time=3228] The name for the Holy Spirit is the periclete coming from pericaleo to call.
[time=3234] What does God do?
[time=3235] He comes in the form, the spirit, and He stands right alongside and He braves together with us.
[time=3241] So David would say, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." Why?
[time=3248] Because David was so strong.
[time=3251] No, because thou art with me.
[time=3256] See, God's the source of all comfort.
[time=3258] The apostle Paul, when he thought that he was about to have his life taken away, said to Timothy, "Not withstanding the Lord stood by me and strengthened me
[time=3269] that I might preach the gospel more fully." The Lord stood by him.
[time=3275] Today you may feel like someone's got a hold of your life and they're just squeezing it out of you.
[time=3281] But the word of God wants you to know that God's going to stand by you.
[time=3285] And that though the floods of life come, they will not overflow thee.
[time=3289] Though thou walk through the fires, he'll bring you through the fires that God promises to comfort you today.
[time=3298] How's God going to do that?
[time=3300] I believe He does it in three ways, found in this passage.
[time=3303] God Himself comforts us, first of all.
[time=3306] We've just talked about that.
[time=3308] Secondly, He uses other people to comfort us.
[time=3311] Look at verse 4.
[time=3312] God who comforts us in all of our tribulations so that we may be of comfort to them who are in any trouble.
[time=3320] God uses other people who care.
[time=3324] God may be squeezing your life to use it in the life of someone else.
[time=3330] So He uses other Christians to comfort us.
[time=3333] But thirdly, He uses His word.
[time=3336] And how do I get that?
[time=3337] That's the very purpose of this whole passage, is to say that the word of God will comfort us.
[time=3343] But I need to give you a word of warning.
[time=3346] You cannot come to the word of God for the first time in the middle of the crisis.
[time=3352] It will be strange music to you.
[time=3355] Men and women, you've got to weave into the very fabric of your life the colors of the word of God.
[time=3362] So that when the time of testing and the time of tribulation and the time of squeezing comes, that it's already built in the fabric of your life and it's not strange music.
[time=3374] How does God comfort us by His presence, by His people, and by His word?
[time=3381] And what I want to share with you most of all is its sufficient.
[time=3385] That God's grace is sufficient.
[time=3388] That although it may seem like the very life is being squeezed out of you, there's a direct correlation between our afflictions and our constellations.
[time=3399] Verse 5, "For just as the sufferings of Christ abound in us,
[time=3405] so also the consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
[time=3411] The more the tribulation God promises, the more the comfort, the more that He'll stand alongside of you, it is sufficient.
[time=3421] But there may be days when you feel that it's not enough.
[time=3425] In those days, God promises not only that He can comfort you, but He also promises that He will deliver you.
[time=3435] Where'd I get that from?
[time=3437] Look with me, if you will, at verses 8 through 11.
[time=3442] Paul now has said God comforts, he understands that, but he says God will even do more than that.
[time=3450] What is first of all is dilemma.
[time=3452] He said, "Well, we don't want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia.
[time=3458] We were pressed out of measure above strength." Paul said, "Man, we'd had it.
[time=3464] The measure of persecution was so great we'd had it.
[time=3467] We were out of strength it was gone." I don't know what his dilemma was exactly, but Paul had some dilemmas.
[time=3475] Flip back to the 11th chapter of this book and you'll get a biography of the Apostle Paul that is something less than attractive.
[time=3485] 2 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23, he said, "Here's what's happened to me.
[time=3490] In labors more abundantly, and stripes above measure, and prisons more frequently, in deaths often, of the Jews five times received I 40 stripes less one.
[time=3502] Three times I was beaten with rods.
[time=3505] Once I was stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck.
[time=3508] A day and a night I've been in the depth." The Bible are box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3521] While a pickle picker finishes picking a pack of pickles, sequer is still only once the best pickles the pickle picker picked.
[time=3529] But that's just the beginning because they are then cured, processed.
