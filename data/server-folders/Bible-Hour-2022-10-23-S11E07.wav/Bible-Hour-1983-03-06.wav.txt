[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=19] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=23] As you know, we're in a month of missions, and in just a moment,
[time=30] our choir is going...
[time=60] [MUSIC]
[time=79] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=95] Missions. We want to thank you this morning for worshiping with us, and welcome you who are here in this auditorium, and welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible hour.
[time=106] This morning, as our choir sings, it's a song taken from scripture, from Acts chapter 1 verse 8 where Jesus said, "Go he into all the world and to preach the gospel." And he says, "You shall receive power that has come upon you after you receive the Holy Ghost, and you shall be my witnesses." In Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the other most parts of the world, you shall be witnesses. It's a truth that Christ taught, and it's a song that our choir sings for us this morning.
[time=144] We shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[time=156] and we shall be my witnesses, and we shall be my witnesses until the end,
[time=168] until the end shall be heard. We shall receive power,
[time=184] and be my witnesses, and be my witnesses. We shall be witnesses,
[time=198] on to the ends of the world, the ends of the earth.
[time=216] And we shall receive power when the end shall be heard.
[time=244] And the end of the earth, with the service, with the service.
[time=258] And the service, with the service, with the service,
[time=272] and the service, with the service, and the other most parts of the world.
[time=288] We shall receive power, and be my witnesses,
[time=300] and be my witnesses. We shall be witnesses, and to the ends of the earth,
[time=316] the ends of the earth, of the end.
[time=332] Now shall we take our hymnals and turn them to hymn number 654,
[time=339] and sing till the whole world knows we should be witnesses to the ends of the earth, till the whole world knows you in your small corner, and die in mind.
[time=350] Hymn number 654, shall we stand together now as we sing.
[time=359] Singing together.
[time=361] I will tell you who my love is, for the world has never known,
[time=370] to bring the passion of his love.
[time=374] For I do it under hope, till the whole world knows,
[time=383] till the whole world knows.
[time=387] I will shove and sing a bright flagging, till the whole world knows.
[time=398] I'll tell the world, till the whole world knows me.
[time=407] That love is a greasy heart, this o'er heaven go and free,
[time=415] till the whole world knows, till the whole world knows.
[time=424] I will shove and sing a bright flagging, till the whole world knows.
[time=437] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=439] I want you to listen now to one of the teachers from our Christian school, Mr. Tom Snodgrass, he's going to come and minister through music on his violin.
[time=449] He plays an old familiar song, see if you can detect it, and in your heart, sing the words with him, Tom Snodgrass.
[time=467] [MUSIC - 112 seconds]
[time=609] Thank you, Tom, by the uniqueness of that instrument, our attention was captured.
[time=619] We listened to the familiar words as they went through our own minds near to the heart of God. We've come to the Father's house this morning that we might draw near to him, that through his word he might strengthen us, even renew us, to encourage us that we might be sent forth to serve him with a new and a fresher heart, having first drawn near to him.
[time=643] We have several opportunities to serve him together that I would like to outline in the bulletin for you today. Next Sunday is Easter Sunday morning, and there are great numbers of people who don't make it their usual habit to go to church, but on something like Christmas or Easter, they might consider that, particularly if you were to invite them and ask them to come. You could have a tremendous outreach next week, not only celebrating the resurrection of Christ as a family, but to go beyond that and use it as an opportunity of outreach, and then you could do another thing that would help us. Our parking facilities are more than adequate.
[time=681] We have a parking lot on the south side of the straight street that could handle a hundred or more cars, but you know many people who aren't really interested in going to church, who really aren't seeking the Lord, are looking for excuses, and one of the best excuses not to come to church is more, I couldn't even get in the parking lot, and I try to make it my habit of parking across the street, and if some of you faithful ones would do that, that would leave some convenient spots for those who are only going to come to church if it's convenient. Now I know all of you are here out of commitment, but there are some who only come out of convenience, and that could be even a way of helping bring people to church that they might know of the Lord. Also in the bulletin it speaks of Wednesday evening, this Wednesday evening we will not be having our regular week of prayer and service, but because this is the week of the celebration of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, we're taking that Wednesday evening as a time of communion and caring and sharing, and as a special part of that evening, Don Kruger will be doing a chalk drawing that I know you will not only enjoy, but you'll be finding to be a very good stimulation to your own mind to consider the cross of Christ and all that He's done for you. We invite you to come to that communion service at seven o'clock this coming Wednesday.
[time=761] In preparation for the Easter musical next week, the choir will be practicing at four and the orchestra at three. Next Sunday in the morning and in the evening service, our orchestra will be a part of our worship.
[time=773] We're looking forward to that, and then in the evening service at six o'clock, the evening will be a musical entitled "He Lives." We are looking at a couple who are from our church as possible people to come in June to serve as a part-time youth pastor.
[time=791] John and Amy Such have both come to know the Lord through our church as high school students. They've gone on to Cedarville College. Both John and Amy will be graduating this June. They've been involved in operation outreach, our student missions program. Two years ago, John had the opportunity to go as a missionary for a summer to communist China.
[time=811] They've lived in Florida the last few years and been a part of a youth ministry there, and tonight we'll be interviewing them before the evening service, and they're teaching in our junior high and senior high today, and we want to invite particularly the parents of teenagers to come to an afterglow in rooms 124 and 126 as an opportunity to meet John and Amy and to talk with them as a part of this interview process.
[time=835] That will be tonight following the evening service.
[time=838] Well, there are a number of other announcements in the bulletin. The only other of which I'll share with you is that we are receiving a special Easter offering. I was so thankful on Friday that all of my responsibilities took me outside of the building, because on Friday we had four buses break down, which is a challenge when you only own two buses, but we had a group from Mansfield Christian School that were here, and their bus broke down as they were leaving, so we were going to help them. We sent a bus to pick them up, which broke down, and then we sent another one, and it broke down, and one of our maintenance men went to Fort Wayne Christian and borrowed their bus and called about five minutes later and said, "You're not going to believe this. I'm a famous recipe chicken." The bus broke down.
[time=881] Now, there's some good news, and there's some bad news.
[time=885] The good news is our buses are better than our vans, and that's the bad news, and we're taking a special Easter offering that we can buy some new vans that will be crucial to our ministry. We drive
[time=900] literally thousands and thousands and thousands of miles that make the ministry possible, particularly for super 60s, not only for super 60s, but for our youth ministry, for our school, and so we're endeavoring to raise somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000 that we can purchase those new vans. Now, if I haven't been persuasive this morning, could I invite you to stop and look at the vans on your way out, and that will be in good encouragement to you? Well, today, we're thankful for the opportunity to serve, to worship, and to give together.
[time=933] We give, yes, because it provides for a ministry, but God can provide in a number of ways. He's chosen to do that through you and I, but we really give out of love to him, because he first gave his life for us.
[time=946] Norm Whistler is a new man coming on our board, and he's been on our board for a number of years, and in a few weeks he'll be assuming the role of flock to equine over group five. Norm, would you come and lead us in prayer?
[time=958] Let's look to the Lord in prayer, please.
[time=964] Father, we thank you for this opportunity to worship you in this way, Father, to return to you gifts that you've already given to us, and Father, our music this morning has talked about telling the world of Jesus, beginning here in Fort Wayne, going through the state, the nation, and the world, but Father, it takes funds to do that, so we thank you that through this way, that there is a way to tell Jesus.
[time=988] We pray that our commitment would be with ourselves, with the monies that you've given to us, and then with our lives.
[time=995] Thank you for the service this morning, Father, and we pray that our hearts will be closer to you throughout the remainder of this service, this day, and our lives.
[time=1003] We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1028] We have come into this house, and gathered in His name to worship Him.
[time=1049] So forget about yourself, and concentrate on Him, and worship Him.
[time=1086] He is all my righteousness, I stand complete in Him and worship Him.
[time=1140] So forget about yourself, and concentrate on Him, and worship Him.
[time=1148] We have come into this house, and gathered in His name to worship Christ the Lord.
[time=1159] Amen, Jesus Christ the Lord, Oh worship Him, Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1186] Thank you freedom singers, and each one of you today your singing has been an encouragement, as we sang about missions, the songs that we have had opportunity to share in together,
[time=1197] take our attention and focus it beyond our own little corner, and to think about serving Jesus
[time=1203] Christ around the world. We're in the last week of a month of missions, a time when we focused
[time=1209] our attention on the Word of God, music, missionaries, missions, presentations. Tonight we'll bring
[time=1216] that all to a climax, and we want to encourage you to join us this evening for that time of culmination. We'll be having a presentation from the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission with some testimonies,
[time=1227] and we'll be an exciting night, I'm sure, to be able to come to God's house, and we want to invite you to make a special effort to joining us tonight. As we come to open up God's Word,
[time=1238] let's first open up our hearts to Him in prayer. Father, we ask now that you would speak to us through your Word, that you would renew us, that you would change our thinking, that you would make
[time=1249] us of a new mind and a new heart, that we might see life as you see it today, we might look at life
[time=1257] from your perspective and not our own. For it's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Over the last few
[time=1265] months we've been studying systematically through the book of 2 Corinthians, and at the same time we've turned our attention to missions, and it works out quite well that as we come to the book
[time=1276] of 2 Corinthians, chapters 4 and 5, we are able to talk this morning and in the next service about
[time=1283] making sense out of missions. Last week we began a four-part series called Making Sense Out of
[time=1290] Missions, and we said the first step was to develop a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life.
[time=1297] We found that lesson in 2 Corinthians, chapter 4, verses 7 through 15. This morning allow me to
[time=1304] read for you, verses 16 through chapter 5, verse 8, as we continue making sense out of missions.
[time=1311] For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[time=1320] day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
[time=1328] exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not on the things which are seen,
[time=1334] but on the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. For we know that if our earthly house of this
[time=1347] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal
[time=1355] in the heavens. For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house,
[time=1362] which is from heaven. If so be that, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[time=1373] For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened, not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. Now he that has wrought us for this
[time=1386] very same thing is God, who hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. Therefore we are always
[time=1395] confident knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.
[time=1402] For while we walk by faith, not by sight. For we are confident, I say,
[time=1410] being rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. Last week we studied
[time=1418] developing a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life. This morning we are going to study together
[time=1424] developing an eternal perspective in life, developing an eternal perspective in life.
[time=1433] The Apostle Paul begins with a little phrase for which cause we faint not. Now what cause is he
[time=1439] speaking of? It's the cause which we studied last week, living our life through our Christian philosophy. Last week we learned a little of this and a little of that and we'll review that for this morning. In chapter 4 verse 7 it says, "So that the excellency of the power may be of God."
[time=1457] A Christian philosophy of life is one that's lived so that the power of our lives is seen
[time=1464] as coming from God. Verses 10 and 11 say this, "So that in our life Jesus Christ might be made
[time=1474] manifest." The second dimension to a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life is that we live so
[time=1480] that Christ is seen in our life. And in verse 15 it says this, "We live so that the abundant
[time=1490] grace might, through the thanksgiving of many, read down to the glory of God. We live so that
[time=1499] the glory may be given to God." But in order for all those so that's to be fulfilled, verses 6,
[time=1506] 7, 8 tell us that our lives are broken, that we hold this treasure in an earthen pot and that you
[time=1513] and I are troubled on every side, every angle, every in-road, every attack. There's tribulation.
[time=1520] We are distressed, we're perplexed, we're persecuted, and we're knocked down.
[time=1529] That sounds like something of an adventure, but not always a desirable adventure.
[time=1533] And there's often within us the desire to want to say, "I quit." That's why Paul began
[time=1540] verse 16 with these words, "For this cause we faint not, for what cause, for the cause of living
[time=1546] our life to the glory of God." He says, "We faint not, we don't quit, we don't give up." Mr. Longbreak, the principal of our school and I are running, not because either one of us need it,
[time=1558] just to relate to the larger part of our society that's taken up jogging.
[time=1562] The other day, we were jogging down a railroad track crosses and a train was coming by in the
[time=1568] distance and he said, "Do you think we can run fast enough to catch it before the caboose goes by?" And I said, "I'm sure I can." I took off and I ran and I ran. It's about three to four hundred yards.
[time=1578] But you know they make trains faster than they used to. And that caboose was pulled along and,
[time=1585] you know, I quit with 50 yards to go, "Do you ever do that in life?" You're running and you just quit.
[time=1592] Do you ever want to look your boss in the eye and say, "I quit." Do you ever want to grab a
[time=1601] hold of your husband? Grab him by that tie and say, "I quit." All of us have points in life when it
[time=1614] seems that it's just easier to quit than it is to chase the caboose.
[time=1616] Apostle Paul says, "We feign not." We don't quit. Now how could he come to that point, looking at his
[time=1626] life, all that he suffered, how could he say, "I quit." I believe it's because he had developed an eternal perspective on life and his next words are a challenge to you and I to do the same thing,
[time=1637] to develop that eternal perspective on life. And he's going to use in this passage three phrases,
[time=1644] three thoughts to tell us how we can develop that eternal perspective on life.
[time=1649] Look at verse 16, "But though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
[time=1657] First thing he says is this, "You and I have got to learn to look on the inner man and not on the
[time=1665] outer man." Let's take a little time to do a little defining. What's the inner man? What's the outer man? Well the outer man, I think he means our bodies, but something more than our bodies. He
[time=1676] not only means our person, but I believe he means our person and our personality. I'm not going to
[time=1683] pretend to be a clinical psychologist today, but I believe that there are at least three dimensions to our personality. There's our mind, our thought processes. There is our heart, or what you and I
[time=1695] might call our emotions, and there is our will. When Paul talks about the outer man, he's not only
[time=1703] talking about flesh and bones, but he's talking about personality, the mind, the emotions, the will,
[time=1709] the desires, the appetites, the cravings, and yes, the body itself. Then he speaks about an inward man.
[time=1717] Well, what's the inward man? Sounds like we've talked about everything. The inward man is that spiritual dimension to life. What you might call soul, our spirit, God consciousness
[time=1727] inside us, there's that noble being that knows God. And Paul says we've got to look at the inner
[time=1739] man and not the outer man. And he's going to tell us why. He says this, "For the outward man
[time=1747] is perishing." That word means to grow old, to decay, to deteriorate, to fall apart.
[time=1759] Ray Stedman is one of the greatest pastors in our country at this time, and he must be in his mid-50s.
[time=1765] Here's what he wrote. "I have noticed that the newspaper print gets smaller and smaller
[time=1772] all the time, and I cannot tell what is going on around me unless someone reads out loud,
[time=1778] which doesn't help too much because they're talking softer and softer these days.
[time=1783] I have noticed too that people are younger than they were when I used to be their age,
[time=1789] and people my own age are considerably older than I am. I ran into one of my college classmates
[time=1797] the other day. He had changed so much he didn't even recognize me." You know, one of the inevitable truths of life is that you and I grow older and older and older.
[time=1810] There was a great battle in American history called the Battle of the Bulge, and most of us are still fighting it today. Bulges here and bulges there, and men, remember, looking at some of those
[time=1822] high school pictures, that massive chest, it's still there. It just sunk about 12 inches.
[time=1827] The law of gravity takes over in these bodies of ours. It seems to pull everything downward.
[time=1833] There was a law called the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and to put it in its simplest forms,
[time=1840] it simply says this. Things go from greater complexity to less complexity, from greater order to less
[time=1846] order, from more energy to less energy, and that's not only true of the physical universe, it's true of our bodies. We spend a far more energy in trying to meet the needs of the outward man
[time=1860] than we ever dream of taking care of the inward man, and it's a losing battle. In spite of what
[time=1867] the Cambridge Diet promises, it's a losing battle. We're going to grow old. Our eyes going to grow
[time=1876] dim. Our hands are going to grow weak. Our minds are going to grow slower. We're perishing.
[time=1888] It's an inevitable truth of life. You and I are perishing. Now, is there profit and exercise?
[time=1897] Is there value in a trip to the wise? Is it worth it to go the spawn to pump the iron?
[time=1902] Is it really a value to try to keep on a diet? Yes, it is. Paul said to Timothy, bodily exercise profits a little, but spiritual exercise profits to all things.
[time=1914] But you know, my body is growing weaker. My mind is growing weaker. My emotions are growing weaker.
[time=1919] My will is growing weaker. I'm growing weaker and weaker and weaker as a person and as a personality, but there's one part of you and I that can grow stronger and stronger.
[time=1928] And that's the inner man. Why is it different? Because it can be renewed. Look at verse 16.
[time=1938] Yet the inward man is renewed day by day. Now that little word renew occurs four or five times in the
[time=1944] Bible. Four times refer to what we're talking about, this being one of them. And in Romans 12,
[time=1951] one and two, it says something to this order. I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercy of Christ that you present your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto him, which is your reasonable service. And don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Now Corinthians and Romans tells us to have our
[time=1974] minds renewed, but wouldn't you like to know how to have your mind renewed? Well, there's two other places this word occurs. Leave your finger right here in second Corinthians and flip back to the
[time=1984] book of Titus. First and second Thessalonians, first and second Timothy Titus. Titus chapter three,
[time=1991] verse five, a somewhat familiar verse of the Bible says this, not by works of righteousness,
[time=2000] which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the
[time=2012] renewing of the Holy Spirit. There's our word renewing. Now what this passage is telling us is when we
[time=2021] come to Christ, we come to him first, not by works of righteousness, which we've done. What does that
[time=2027] mean? Well, it means this, we can come to God and we can be born again. That's what that word
[time=2033] regeneration means. Generation means a birth, re again, to be born again, but it's not by works
[time=2043] of righteousness, which we do. That means I don't say God, here's all my good deeds, and by the way, here's all my bad deeds. And God says, okay, and he takes him up to heaven, he puts him on this celestial scale, and good deeds are on one side, bad deeds on the other. And if as they bounce, there are more good deeds as I make it. That would be by works, by good deeds, by the works of righteousness. It says, that's not how we come to God, but we come to him by being born again through the power of the Holy Spirit, which renews us. That means it makes us into a new person. It means
[time=2076] that spiritual inward man comes alive. How can you be renewed today by coming to Jesus Christ,
[time=2082] and allowing him to renew you, to make you again, so that he can fulfill 2 Corinthians 5 17, which says,
[time=2089] if anyone be in Christ, he's a new creature, a new person placed within you, with new desires,
[time=2097] new appetites, new values, new hungers, new cravings, it's by the Spirit of God.
[time=2105] You say, well, that happened to me, but somehow I've grown kind of unrenewed if you can do that. It's past week, a young man who we knew five years ago called,
[time=2116] and he said, just wanted to let you know that last night I received Jesus Christ as my Savior, and I want to talk to you. So he came down, and this guy was alive. I mean, he sat down in a chair, but he had to keep sitting down. He was so excited. The more he would talk about how God had changed his life. He was up, and he was moving, and he was excited. He was renewed. Then he said, I've talked to a couple of people who've been to Christians for a long time, and man, they're in bad shape. Is that going to happen to me? They had the spiritual blossom. He said, is that what's really going to happen to me? It could. Maybe you're one of the people he was
[time=2152] talking about. How can you keep this renewed life renewing as Paul said in Corinthians day by day?
[time=2160] Do you remember the enthusiasm you had when you first came to Christ? I was going to tell the world.
[time=2166] Actually, I've told about two people. Do you remember that enthusiasm that you had?
[time=2172] Wouldn't you love to have it again today, and to keep it going, and going, and going?
[time=2178] Wouldn't you like to have the knowledge you have today with the enthusiasm you had back then?
[time=2183] Well, how do you keep that renewal? Turn with me to Colossians chapter 3. Galatians,
[time=2193] Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians chapter 3 verse 10.
[time=2198] And we have put on the new man. Here we're talking about that inward man, that new man again.
[time=2208] We have put on the new man that is renewed. See, you can have a new man, and even though he's new,
[time=2214] he can be renewed. Or if it's a she, you can be renewed. A new one can be kept new.
[time=2220] How? We are renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. Basically, it's saying this,
[time=2230] that you and I can be renewed day by day by day, if we're in the knowledge of him,
[time=2236] day by day by day, and there is no knowledge of him apart from his word. But as you and I
[time=2242] approach the word of God, this is our food, this is our meat, this is our mirror, this is the hammer
[time=2250] that crushes us and makes our heart tender. This is the fire which melts us and remakes us and
[time=2256] molds us. It's through the word of God that you and I can be renewed. Do you know there are people
[time=2263] today that have the same vibrancy, the same intensity for Christ as they did 20 years ago when they
[time=2270] came to him? Are you a little bit jealous? Are you trying to somehow beat a bad case of the
[time=2276] flaws? Could it be that you're really not being renewed? You know, in many ways, that's what
[time=2283] church is about. If I can make this all seem so earthly, you know, our primary purpose this morning
[time=2290] is not educational. We are trying to educate, but primarily our purpose is what the Bible calls
[time=2298] ex-ortation. Education means teaching somebody something. Exortation means motivating somebody to
[time=2306] do what they already know. You know, the majority of our lives today, you and I are not suffering spiritually from a bad case of the flaws, from a lack of knowledge. It's from a lack of motivation.
[time=2321] How are you going to beat it? Our church service this morning is designed to be an exhortation, to exhort the brethren, to be renewed through the word of God. Paul said the outward man is falling
[time=2338] apart, yet the inward man can be renewed day by day. And if you and I are going to gain an eternal
[time=2346] perspective on life, we first got to start looking at the inward man and not the outward man.
[time=2353] Second thing comes in verse 17 says this, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
[time=2359] work of afar, more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory."
[time=2366] Believe the second principle he's sharing there is this, that you and I have got to stop looking
[time=2373] on the immediate and looking toward the ultimate. You and I, as humans, have a predisposition
[time=2382] to self-gratification. It doesn't simply have to be gratification of a physical desire for food,
[time=2389] for water. It can be a desire for significance or security. We have needs and personality motivates
[time=2398] us to meet those needs. And some of our needs are immediate and some of them are ultimate.
[time=2405] And there's always a battle within us that immediate versus the ultimate. Now let me give you some practical illustrations. Your ultimate goal is to lose 17 pounds. Sitting before you is a large
[time=2421] slice of lasagna stuffed with ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese melting down over the sides.
[time=2430] The immediate desire, I shouldn't say that in the second service right before lunch,
[time=2438] the immediate desire is to eat. And the ultimate desire says 17 pounds.
[time=2450] Do you see that tension? The immediate versus the ultimate. The church banks,
[time=2457] at the same bank that we bank at, which means we don't even get a paycheck. Our pay gets deposited right into a bank and we've got it set up so that so much of our money gets
[time=2468] put into checking to pay bills to live often, so much of it goes into savings. The checkings to meet our immediate needs and the savings are ultimate. We're saving for this and that, a bigger house, we're filling ours. All these ultimate things that you save for in life.
[time=2481] And so automatically goes in immediate and this goes in ultimate. Now our bank has another
[time=2489] little gizmo called a bank machine card. In about the middle of the pay period, every week we go with our bank machine card, plug it in, plug in all these numbers and take out of savings, that which we put in. After three years of savings, our account has swelled to somewhere close to $32. Do you know why? It's not that we don't get paid enough. We get paid fairly,
[time=2510] we get paid well, but it's we're constantly trading our ultimate for the immediate.
[time=2516] I don't know how many new houses have gone to the wayside for the one of a pizza with extra cheese.
[time=2528] Your laugh is not one that's laughing with me. I sense it's a laugh with me. You know, we all are
[time=2534] in that struggle. What will do us the ultimate good and what we want to do for our immediate gratification very rarely in life are the same. You know the same thing is true spiritually. That
[time=2547] which our mind, our body, our will, what we want for today and what we want to get rid of today
[time=2554] is based upon one thing. We're only looking at our immediate situation and we're not looking at our ultimate situation. Paul says you and I've got to stop looking at the immediate and start
[time=2564] looking at the ultimate. Here's how he says it. He's talking about the afflictions of life today
[time=2570] and he describes them in two ways. First of all, he says they're light. They are, tribulation on
[time=2577] every side, that's light, distress, that's light, persecution's light, getting knocked down is light, being shipwrecked is light. Well, in comparison, it's light. Second thing he said, it's momentary.
[time=2590] I doubt that when Paul was floating out in the ocean for a day upon day and night upon night, he thought, oh, this is just a regular splash party the Romans have planned for me, which it
[time=2601] could last longer. No, I'm sure that it seemed in eternity as waves beat him down. But in comparison,
[time=2609] look how strategically he uses his vocabulary and phraseology to make the comparison. While the
[time=2615] affliction is light, the glory is called a far more exceeding weight. And the affliction,
[time=2626] which is for a moment, is compared to the glory, which is forever eternal. You see, we all suffer
[time=2635] a great number of things. But if we can learn to look beyond our immediate pain, our immediate
[time=2643] disappointment, our immediate hurts, and we look at the ultimate gain, then we're learning to develop
[time=2650] an eternal perspective on life. First, you've got to stop focusing the attention, which is so natural,
[time=2658] that which will gratify immediately, and that which will gratify ultimately. Drama,
[time=2666] athletics, and music are tremendous avenues to learn that truth. I'm sure in Tom Snodgrass's
[time=2675] lives, there were days when the calluses on the fingers said quit, and he didn't. And ultimately,
[time=2684] he became a tremendous violinist. I'm sure there were days in the life of Leon and Emily Pippen,
[time=2693] as they put together a tremendous production of drama, that they wanted to send the kids home
[time=2699] and to quit. But they didn't, and they produced a tremendous play. I'm sure there are days in the
[time=2705] lives of the marathon runners that somewhere far before the 26-mile mark, they wanted to quit.
[time=2713] But Salazar did not anyone. There are days in our Christian life where we want to quit,
[time=2722] because the immediate desire is to say, "I quit," but hang in there, because ultimately,
[time=2728] there is a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory. If we're going to develop an eternal
[time=2734] perspective in life, we must first learn to look at the inner man and not the outer man.
[time=2742] Secondly, we must learn to look not at the immediate, but at the ultimate. And thirdly,
[time=2748] verse 18, we must learn to look at the unseen and not the seen. While we look not at the things
[time=2758] which are seen but on the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal,
[time=2766] but the things which are not seen are eternal. The best way I know to explain this to you
[time=2774] is to ask you to turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11, verses 1
[time=2785] and following. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
[time=2797] Paul says faith is the eye that sees that which cannot be seen and sees the evidence of that,
[time=2807] which is not even in existence yet, it's only hoped for. And now he's going to give some tremendous illustrations of that. Look at verse 7, "By faith, Noah warned of God of things,
[time=2819] not seen as yet." You know what I think that phrase means? I believe it means that it had never
[time=2826] rained on earth before. And God says, "Noah, it's going to rain." As Bill Cosby would say,
[time=2832] "Right. What's rain?" It's going to rain for 40 days and 40 nights. And I want you to build an
[time=2841] arc three times the size of a football field. Let me ask you this. How would you explain it? You know the guy, just think of the guy who lives next door to you right now. It's never rained and you're out in the back building an arc three times the size of a football field.
[time=2854] Do you think you might have some questions? But Moses, Abraham, Noah, all these men
[time=2863] followed God in what was not seen. By faith, Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet
[time=2870] moved with fear prepared an arc to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and
[time=2876] became the heir of righteousness by faith. Moses, Abraham, Noah, they didn't see it but yet they
[time=2884] believed in it and they followed it. Look at Abraham, verse 8, "By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should go after and receive for an inheritance, obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went." Picture this, you're living rather
[time=2905] effluently rather comfortably and God comes and says, "I've got a new place I want to lead you to." I don't know about you but you know what my first question would be? Where? And God said,
[time=2916] "Don't worry about it. I've picked it out." And he went not seeing where he was gone. Looking down
[time=2924] at verse 24, Moses, "By faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of
[time=2931] Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God and enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the approach of Christ richer than the treasures in Egypt.
[time=2942] For he had respect unto the recompense of the reward." You know what Moses did? He left everything.
[time=2951] He was considered Pharaoh's grandson and he was willing to leave that behind
[time=2957] and become the leader of a group of slaves. You know what's more amazing about that?
[time=2963] Look at the next verse, "By faith he forsook Egypt, fearing the wrath of the king, for he
[time=2971] endured as seeing him who was invisible." No a building arch when he'd never seen rain. Abraham
[time=2979] went to a land that he'd never seen and Moses followed a Christ that was invisible.
[time=2986] That's how you develop an eternal perspective on life. As we take our attention and our mind and
[time=2996] we focus it not on the things which are seen but the things that are not seen. Why?
[time=3006] Because the things which are seen are temporal. Temporal means they only relate to life today,
[time=3013] the good old here and now. I don't know how many times I've heard someone say, "I live for the good old here and now." I don't believe in any of this spot in the sky religion. It reminds me of one
[time=3028] who Jesus called a rich fool. A man who had had a bumper crop and his barns had become full
[time=3034] over flowing so he built more barns, bigger barns, and he died. What a brief and direct commentary.
[time=3045] And he died. Someone's put it this way and it's probably something you've heard before.
[time=3051] Have you ever seen a hearse pulling a u-hollet?
[time=3055] That's what he means when he says the things that are seen are temporal. Nobody takes it with him.
[time=3063] But you know there are things that you can take with you if you live for the unseen, for the kingdom of God and for the glory of God.
[time=3075] In chapter 5 verses 1 through 8, he holds forth a promise. God, that's an awful lot to say.
[time=3084] Don't live for the outward man. Live for the inward man. Don't live for the immediate gratification. Live for the ultimate. Don't live for the seen. Live for the answered. God, that's an awful lot to ask. But he says, "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[time=3098] were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens." You know what he's saying right there? He's saying this. That God will provide for us in eternity,
[time=3111] an outward man that's mortality swallowed up with a new body. And the encouragement for us is to live
[time=3120] for that ultimate body that will be seen. And so it says this, that we even look at life from this
[time=3127] perspective eternity, that we would rather be absent from this body so that we could be present
[time=3134] with the Lord. Jim Elliott, the missionary to the Aukkah Indians said something that I try to say
[time=3143] to myself several times a week. It's this phrase, "He is no fool who gives up that which he cannot keep
[time=3155] to gain, that which he can never lose." You see, he had an eternal perspective on life.
[time=3161] How do you develop that eternal perspective on life? Paul said three things. We look at the
[time=3168] inward man, not the outward. Second, we look at the ultimate and not the immediate. Thirdly,
[time=3176] we look on the unseen and not the seen. What is it that your eye sees today?
[time=3183] Have you developed an eternal perspective on life? You know, you'll not only fail to make sense
[time=3191] out of missions without it. You'll really fail to make sense out of life. There was a rather
[time=3199] famous philosopher by the name of Bertrand Russell. Listen to how he described life. The life of man
[time=3206] is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain,
[time=3215] towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and were non-tary long. One by one, as they march,
[time=3222] our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent death,
[time=3230] brief and powerless his man's life. On him and all his race, the slow, sure doom falls pitiously
[time=3238] and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of destruction, omnipotent matter rolls on in its
[time=3246] relentless way for man condemned today is to lose his dearest tomorrow himself to pass through the
[time=3253] gate of darkness. It remains only to cherish air and yet the blow falls, the lofty thoughts
[time=3261] of his ignoble little day. You know, apart from an eternal perspective on life, Bertrand Russell
[time=3269] was right. That matter just rolls on and omnipotent death swallows us up. But yet the apostle Paul
[time=3278] looked at life and he said, "I would rather be absent from the body die so that I could be present
[time=3284] with the Lord." Well, today we're not sending forth messages of doom and anticipation of destruction.
[time=3291] We're not teaching escapism through death as the existential would uphold. We're teaching that
[time=3298] God can give a direction to life today from an eternal perspective. He says, "If you will
[time=3306] lose your life, you'll find it. And if you'll keep your life, you'll lose it."
[time=3312] Today, will you surrender your heart and your life to Jesus Christ? Will you open up the door of
[time=3319] your heart and invite him in? I pray that you will. Our Father, as we bring our service to a climax,
[time=3329] we're asking you to speak to the hearts of men and women in a way that no human can persuade,
[time=3335] persuade each heart today to follow Christ. Father, if there are those here this morning,
[time=3342] and I'm certain that there are, who've never opened their door to Jesus Christ, we pray that right now that you'll knock on that door. With a loving winsom but compelling way,
[time=3355] speak to them. Father, we pray for those today who don't know Christ, that they would receive them.
[time=3362] We pray for believers who've lost their sense of renewal. Your spirit would exhort them and
[time=3369] motivate them to renew themselves daily through your word. We pray for those who need to make decisions this morning, Father, that with boldness, with confidence, that they would receive Christ
[time=3381] as Savior. For it's in His name we pray. Amen.
[time=3411] Father, we may receive Christ in recent weeks and want to make public that faith, to stand for Him.
[time=3424] Others of you may want to be members of this church and follow Christ in baptism as
[time=3431] two people did in the last service. We're inviting you to slip out of your aisle,
[time=3437] come to the front of this auditorium, and in coming say, "I do want to receive Christ as my
[time=3443] Savior." Our television ministry is gone. We're just as a family here in this auditorium.
[time=3449] Standing before God, be speaking your heart. Will you open up the door of your heart and invite
[time=3458] them in? I pray that you will. Let us stand together and sing as Mr. Krueger leads us. We're
[time=3464] inviting you to come meet me at the front of this auditorium and make your decision for Christ.
[time=3471] I'll be praying that you come.
[time=3494] You've been sharing the Word of God this morning with one of our missionaries, Norm Nicholas, and if as a result of his message, you would like to receive Jesus Christ as your
[time=3503] personal Savior, we invite you to pray this prayer with us right now. Dear Heavenly Father,
[time=3509] I realize that Jesus is the Savior of the world, but today I realize that He is my
[time=3517] personal Savior and I trust Him as such. I transfer my faith from what I have been believing
[time=3524] to Jesus Christ alone for my salvation and I pray that you will save me for Jesus' sake, I pray.
[time=3530] Amen. And I hope that was your prayer this morning. And if it was, Jesus said, "I will come in."
[time=3539] And we have a little booklet that will help you in your newfound Christian life. It's called Your Decision. It shows you how to take the first few steps in your Christian life and walk with the Lord. Earlier today in our program, we shared another booklet. It was called Affirming the Will of God.
