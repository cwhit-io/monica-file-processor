[time=600] - Thank you, Tom, by the uniqueness of that instrument, our attention was captured.
[time=605] We listened to the familiar words as they went through our own minds near to the heart of God.
[time=611] We've come to the Father's house this morning that we might draw near to him, that through his word he might strengthen us, and be courageous, that we might be sent forth to serve him with a new and a fresher heart, having first drawn near to him.
[time=626] We have several opportunities to serve him together that I would like to outline in the bulletin for you today.
[time=632] Next Sunday is Easter Sunday morning, and there are great numbers of people who don't make it their usual habit to go to church, but on something like Christmas or Easter, they might consider that, particularly if you were to invite them and ask them to come, you could have a tremendous outreach next week, not only celebrating the resurrection of Christ as a family, but to go beyond that and use it as an opportunity of outreach.
[time=658] And then you could do another thing that would help us.
[time=661] Our parking facilities are more than adequate.
[time=664] We have a parking lot on the south side of the straight street that could handle a hundred or more cars.
[time=670] But you know, many people who aren't really interested in going to church, who really aren't seeking the Lord, are looking for excuses.
[time=678] And one of the best excuses not to come to church is, "Well, I couldn't even get in the parking lot." And I try to make it my habit of parking across the street, and if some of you faithful ones would do that, that would leave some convenient spots for those who are only going to come to church if it's convenient.
[time=694] Now I know all of you are here out of commitment, but there are some who only come out of convenience, and that could be even a way of helping bring people to church that they might know of the Lord.
[time=704] Also in the bulletin, it speaks of Wednesday evening.
[time=707] This Wednesday evening, we will not be having our regular week of prayer and service, but because this is the week of the celebration of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, we're taking that Wednesday evening as a time of communion and caring and sharing, and as a special part of that evening, Don Kruger will be doing a chalk drawing that I know you will not only enjoy, but you'll be finding to be a very good stimulation to your own mind to consider the cross of Christ and all that He's done for you.
[time=738] We invite you to come to that communion service at seven o'clock this coming Wednesday.
[time=743] In preparation for the Easter musical next week, the choir will be practicing at four and the orchestra at three.
[time=751] Next Sunday in the morning and in the evening service, our orchestra will be a part of our worship.
[time=756] We're looking forward to that, and then in the evening service at six o'clock, the evening will be a musical entitled "He Lives." We are looking at a couple who are from our church as possible, people to come in June to serve as a part-time youth pastor.
[time=773] John and Amy Sutch have both come to know the Lord through our church as high school students.
[time=779] They've gone on to Cedarville College.
[time=781] Both John and Amy will be graduating this June.
[time=784] They've been involved in operation outreach, our student missions program.
[time=788] Two years ago, John had the opportunity to go as a missionary for a summer to Communist China.
[time=793] They've lived in Florida the last few years and been a part of a youth ministry there, and tonight we'll be interviewing them before the evening service, and they're teaching in our junior high and senior high today, and we want to invite particularly the parents of teenagers to come to an afterglow in rooms 124 and 126 as an opportunity to meet John and Amy and to talk with them
[time=816] as a part of this interview process.
[time=818] That will be tonight following the evening service.
[time=821] Well, there are a number of other announcements in the bulletin.
[time=824] The only other of which I'll share with you is that we are receiving a special Easter offering.
[time=830] I was so thankful on Friday that all of my responsibilities took me outside of the building,
[time=836] because on Friday we had four buses break down, which is a challenge when you only own two buses, but we had a group from Mansfield Christian School that were here, and their bus broke down as they were leaving, so we were going to help them.
[time=849] We sent a bus to pick them up, which broke down, and then we sent another one, and it broke down, and one of our maintenance men went to Fort Wayne Christian and borrowed their bus and called about five minutes later and said, "You're not going to believe this. I'm a famous recipe chicken." The bus broke down.
[time=864] Now, there's some good news, and there's some bad news.
[time=867] The good news is our buses are better than our vans, and that's the bad news.
[time=873] And we're taking a special Easter offering that we can buy some new vans that will be crucial to our ministry.
[time=880] We drive literally thousands and thousands and thousands of miles
[time=886] that make the ministry possible, particularly for Super 60s.
[time=890] Not only for Super 60s, but for our youth ministry, for our school, and so we're endeavoring to race.
[time=897] I'm going to talk to you a little bit.
[time=927] [MUSIC]
[time=950] The remainder of this service this day and our lives, we pray in Jesus' name. I'm in.
[time=955] [MUSIC]
[time=969] We have come into His house and gathered in His name to worship Him.
[time=999] We worship Him Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1007] So forget about yourself and concentrate on Him and worship Him.
[time=1036] We worship Him Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1077] He is all my righteousness as then completed in Heaven worship Him.
[time=1088] So forget about yourself and concentrate on Him and worship Him.
[time=1097] We have come into His house and gathered in His name to worship Christ the Lord.
[time=1106] We worship Him Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1115] [MUSIC]
[time=1136] Thank you freedom singers and each one of you today your singing has been an encouragement as we sang about missions the songs that we have had opportunity to share in together.
[time=1147] Take our attention and focus it beyond our own little corner and to think about serving Jesus Christ around the world.
[time=1155] We're in the last week of a month of missions a time when we focused our attention on the Word of God.
[time=1162] Music missionaries missions presentations tonight we'll bring that all to a climax and we want to encourage you to join us this evening
[time=1170] for that time of culmination.
[time=1172] We'll be having a presentation from the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission with some testimonies.
[time=1177] It will be an exciting night I'm sure to be able to come to God's house.
[time=1181] We want to invite you to make a special effort to joining us tonight.
[time=1185] As we come to open up God's Word let's first open up our hearts to Him in prayer.
[time=1191] Father we ask now that you would speak to us through your Word.
[time=1195] That you would renew us, that you would change our thinking, that you would make us of a new mind and a new heart.
[time=1202] That we might see life as you see it today.
[time=1205] We might look at life from your perspective and not our own.
[time=1209] For it's in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[time=1213] Over the last few months we've been studying systematically through the book of 2 Corinthians and at the same time we've turned our attention to missions.
[time=1223] And it works out quite well that as we come to the book of 2 Corinthians 4 and 5
[time=1229] we are able to talk this morning and in the next service about making sense out of missions.
[time=1236] Last week we began a four-part series called Making Sense Out of Missions and we said the first step was to develop a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life.
[time=1247] We found that lesson in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 7 through 15.
[time=1252] This morning allow me to read for you verses 16 through chapter 5 verse 8 as we continue making sense out of missions.
[time=1262] For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
[time=1272] For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[time=1281] While we look not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen.
[time=1287] For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[time=1295] For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.
[time=1308] For in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from heaven.
[time=1316] If so be that, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[time=1323] For we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened, not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
[time=1334] Now he that has wrought us for this very same thing is God, who hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
[time=1343] Therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are home in the body we are absent from the Lord.
[time=1353] For while we walk by faith, not by sight. For we are confident, I say, being rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.
[time=1367] Last week we studied developing a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life.
[time=1372] This morning we are going to study together developing an eternal perspective in life, developing an eternal perspective in life.
[time=1383] The Apostle Paul begins with a little phrase for which cause we faint not.
[time=1388] Now what cause is he speaking of? It's the cause which we studied last week, living our life through our Christian philosophy.
[time=1396] Last week we learned a little of this and a little of that and we'll review that for this morning.
[time=1401] In chapter 4 verse 7 it says, "So that the excellency of the power may be of God."
[time=1408] A Christian philosophy of life is one that's lived so that the power of our lives is seen as coming from God.
[time=1417] Verses 10 and 11 say this, "So that in our life Jesus Christ might be made manifest."
[time=1426] The second dimension to a thoroughly Christian philosophy of life is that we live so that Christ is seen in our life.
[time=1434] And in verse 15 it says this, "We live so that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
[time=1446] We live so that the glory may be given to God.
[time=1452] But in order for all those so that's to be fulfilled, verses 6, 7, 8 tell us that our lives are broken.
[time=1459] That we hold this treasure in an earthen pot and that you and I are troubled on every side, every angle, every in-road, every attack.
[time=1469] There's tribulation, we are distressed, we're perplexed, we're persecuted and we're knocked down.
[time=1479] That sounds like something of an adventure but not always a desirable adventure.
[time=1484] And there's often within us the desire to want to say, "I quit." That's why Paul began verse 16 with these words, "For this cause we faint not, for what cause, for the cause of living our life to the glory of God."
[time=1498] He says, "We faint not, we don't quit, we don't give up." Mr. Longbreak, the principal of our school and I are running, not because either one of us needed.
[time=1508] Just to relate to the larger part of our society that's taken up jogging.
[time=1513] The other day we were jogging down a road that a railroad track crosses and a train was coming by in the distance.
[time=1519] And he said, "Do you think we can run fast enough to catch it before the caboose goes by?" And I said, "I am sure I can. I took off and I ran and I ran. It's about three to four hundred yards."
[time=1529] But you know they make trains faster than they used to.
[time=1532] And that caboose was pulled along and you know I quit the fifty yards to go,
[time=1539] "Do you ever do that in life? You're running and you just quit." Do you ever want to look your boss in the eye and say, "I quit?"
[time=1551] Do you ever want to grab ahold of your husband?
[time=1555] Grab him by that tie and say, "I quit."
[time=1562] All of us have points in life when it seems that it's just easier to quit than it is to chase the caboose.
[time=1568] Apostle Paul says, "We faint not, we don't quit." Now how could he come to that point looking at his life all that he suffered?
[time=1578] How could he say, "I quit." I believe it's because he had developed an eternal perspective on life
[time=1584] and his next words are a challenge to you and I to do the same thing to develop that eternal perspective on life.
[time=1591] And he's going to use in this passage three phrases, three thoughts to tell us how we can develop that eternal perspective on life.
[time=1600] Verse 16, "But though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
[time=1608] First thing he says is this, "You and I have got to learn to look on the inner man and not on the outer man."
[time=1616] Let's take a little time to do a little defining. What's the inner man? What's the outer man?
[time=1621] Well the outer man, I think he means our bodies, but something more than our bodies. He not only means our person, but I believe he means our person and our personality.
[time=1631] I'm not going to pretend to be a clinical psychologist today, but I believe that there are at least three dimensions to our personality.
[time=1639] There's our mind, our thought processes. There is our heart, or what you and I might call our emotions, and there is our will.
[time=1649] When Paul talks about the outer man, he's not only talking about flesh and bones, but he's talking about personality, the mind, the emotions, the will, the desires, the appetites, the cravings.
[time=1662] And yes, the body itself. Then he speaks about an inward man. Well what's the inward man? Sounds like we've talked about everything.
[time=1670] The inward man is that spiritual dimension to life. What you might call soul, our spirit, God consciousness.
[time=1678] Inside us there's that noble being that knows God.
[time=1685] And Paul says we've got to look at the inner man and not the outer man. He's going to tell us why.
[time=1694] He says this, "For the outward man is perishing." That word means to grow old, to decay, to deteriorate, to fall apart.
[time=1709] Ray Stedman is one of the greatest pastors in our country at this time, and he must be in his mid-50s. Here's what he wrote.
[time=1718] I have noticed that the newspaper print gets smaller and smaller all the time, and I cannot tell what is going on around me unless someone reads out loud, which doesn't help too much because they're talking softer and softer these days.
[time=1734] I have noticed too that people are younger than they were when I used to be their age, and people my old age or my own age are considerably older than I am.
[time=1745] I ran into one of my college classmates the other day. He had changed so much he didn't even recognize me.
[time=1755] One of the inevitable truths of life is that you and I grow older and older and older. There was a great battle in American history called the Battle of the Bulge, and most of us are still fighting it today.
[time=1768] Bulges here and bulges there, and men remember looking at some of those high school pictures, that massive chest, it's still there, it just sunk about 12 inches.
[time=1778] The law of gravity takes over in these bodies of ours. It seems to pull everything downward.
[time=1785] There's a law called the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and to put it in its simplest forms, it simply says this.
[time=1792] Things go from greater complexity to less complexity, from greater order to less order, from more energy to less energy, and that's not only true of the physical universe, it's true of our bodies.
[time=1803] We spend a far more energy in trying to meet the needs of the outward man than we ever dream of taking care of the inward man.
[time=1814] And it's a losing battle, in spite of what the Cambridge Diet promises, it's a losing battle.
[time=1820] We're going to grow old, our eyes going to grow dim, our hands are going to grow weak, our minds are going to grow slower.
[time=1834] We're perishing. It's an inevitable truth of life. You and I are perishing.
[time=1844] Now, is there profit and exercise? Is there value in a trip to the wise? Is it worth it to go to the spawn to pump the iron?
[time=1852] Is it really a value to try to keep on a diet? Yes, it is.
[time=1856] Paul said to Timothy, bodily exercise profits a little, but spiritual exercise profits to all things.
[time=1864] But you know, my body's growing weaker, my mind is growing weaker, my emotions are growing weaker, my will is growing weaker,
[time=1871] I'm growing weaker and weaker and weaker as a person and as a personality, but there's one part of you and I that can grow stronger and stronger.
[time=1879] And that's the inner man. Why is it different? Because it can be renewed.
[time=1886] Look at verse 16. Yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
[time=1891] Now, that little word "renew" occurs four or five times in the Bible.
[time=1895] Four times refer to what we're talking about, this being one of them. And in Romans 12, 1 and 2, it says something to this order.
[time=1904] I beseech you, therefore, brothers, by the mercy of Christ that you present your body as a living sacrifice,
[time=1910] holy and acceptable unto Him, which is your reasonable service.
[time=1914] And don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=1921] Now, Corinthians and Romans tells us to have our minds renewed, but wouldn't you like to know how to have your mind renewed?
[time=1928] Well, there's two other places this word occurs.
[time=1931] Leave your finger right here in 2 Corinthians and flip back to the book of Titus, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy Titus.
[time=1940] Titus chapter 3, verse 5, a somewhat familiar verse of the Bible.
[time=1946] It says this, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy,
[time=1956] He saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."
[time=1965] There's our word, renewing.
[time=1968] Now, what this passage is telling us is when we come to Christ, we come to Him, first, not by works of righteousness which we've done.
[time=1976] What does that mean?
[time=1978] Well, it means this, we can come to God and we can be born again.
[time=1983] That's what that word, regeneration means.
[time=1985] Generation means a birth, re again, to be born again.
[time=1991] But it's not by works of righteousness which we do.
[time=1994] That means I don't say, "God, here's all my good deeds," and by the way, here's all my bad deeds.
[time=2000] And God says, "Okay," and He takes them up to heaven, He puts them on this celestial scale, and good deeds are on one side, bad deeds on the other, and if, as they balance, there are more good deeds as I make it.
[time=2010] That would be by works, by good deeds, by the works of righteousness.
[time=2014] It says, "That's not how we come to God, but we come to Him by being born again through the power
[time=2020] of the Holy Spirit which renews us." That means it makes us into a new person.
[time=2026] It means that spiritual, inward man comes alive.
[time=2029] How can you be renewed to date by coming to Jesus Christ and allowing Him to renew you to make you again so that He can fulfill 2 Corinthians 5, 17, which says, "If anyone be in Christ, He's a new creature, a new person placed inside you,
[time=2046] with new desires, new appetites, new values, new hungers, new cravings."
[time=2052] That's by the Spirit of God.
[time=2055] You say, "That had happened to me, but somehow I've grown kind of unrenewed if you can do that." It's past week, a young man who we knew five years ago called and he said, "Just wanted to let you know that last night I received Jesus Christ as my Savior, and I want to talk to you." So he came down and this guy was alive.
[time=2075] I mean, he sat down in a chair, but he had to keep sitting down.
[time=2078] He was so excited. The more he would talk about how God had changed his life, he was up and he was moving and he was excited. He was renewed.
[time=2086] Then he said, "I've talked to a couple people who've been to Christians for a long time, and man, they're in bad shape. Is that going to happen to me?" They had the spiritual blossom. He said, "Is that what's really going to happen to me?" They couldn't. Maybe you're one of the people he was talking about.
[time=2104] How can you keep this renewed life renewing, as Paul said in Corinthians day by day? Do you remember the enthusiasm you had when you first came to Christ?
[time=2114] I was going to tell the world. Actually, I've told about two people.
[time=2120] Do you remember that enthusiasm that you had?
[time=2124] Wouldn't you love to have it again today and to keep it going and going and going?
[time=2128] Wouldn't you like to have the knowledge you have today with the enthusiasm you had back then?
[time=2133] Well, how do you keep that renewal? Turn with me to Colossians, chapter 3. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[time=2145] Chapter 3, verse 10.
[time=2150] And we have put on the new man.
[time=2153] Here we're talking about that inward man, that new man again.
[time=2157] We have put on the new man that is renewed.
[time=2161] See, you can have a new man, and even though he's new, he can be renewed.
[time=2165] Or if it's a she, you can be renewed.
[time=2168] A new one can be kept new.
[time=2172] How? We are renewed in knowledge.
[time=2176] After the image of him that created him, basically it's saying this, that you and I can be renewed day by day by day, if we're in the knowledge of him, day by day by day, and there is no knowledge of him apart from his word.
[time=2191] But as you and I approach the word of God, this is our food.
[time=2196] This is our meat. This is our mirror.
[time=2199] This is the hammer that crushes us and makes our heart tender.
[time=2203] This is the fire which melts us and remakes us and molds us.
[time=2207] It's through the word of God that you and I can be renewed.
[time=2213] Do you know there are people today that have the same vibrancy, the same intensity for Christ as they did 20 years ago when they came to him?
[time=2221] Are you a little bit jealous?
[time=2224] Are you trying to somehow beat a bad case of the blaws?
[time=2228] Could it be that you're really not being renewed?
[time=2232] You know, in many ways that's what church is about.
[time=2235] If I can make this all seem so earthly, you know, our primary purpose this morning is not educational.
[time=2243] We are trying to educate, but primarily our purpose is what the Bible calls exhortation.
[time=2250] Education means teaching somebody something.
[time=2254] Exertation means motivating somebody to do what they already know.
[time=2258] You know, the majority of our lives today, you and I are not suffering spiritually from a bad case of the blaws,
[time=2264] from a lack of knowledge.
[time=2267] It's from a lack of motivation.
[time=2271] How are you going to beat it?
[time=2273] Our church service this morning is designed to be an exhortation to exhort the brethren to be renewed through the word of God.
[time=2284] Paul said the outward man is falling apart.
[time=2290] Yet the inward man can be renewed day by day.
[time=2294] And if you and I are going to gain an eternal perspective on life, we first got to start looking at the inward man and not the outward man.
[time=2304] Second thing comes in verse 17 says this, "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
[time=2310] work of afar, more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory."
[time=2318] I believe the second principle he's sharing there is this, that you and I have got to stop looking on the immediate
[time=2325] and looking toward the ultimate.
[time=2329] You and I, as humans, have a predisposition to self-gratification.
[time=2336] It doesn't simply have to be gratification of a physical desire for food, for water.
[time=2341] It can be a desire for significance or security.
[time=2345] We have needs and personality motivates us to meet those needs.
[time=2351] And some of our needs are immediate and some of them are ultimate.
[time=2355] And there's always a battle within us, the immediate versus the ultimate.
[time=2359] Now let me give you some practical illustrations.
[time=2363] Your ultimate goal is to lose 17 pounds.
[time=2368] Sitting before you is a large slice of lasagna stuffed with ricotta cheese
[time=2377] and mozzarella cheese melding down over the sides.
[time=2383] The immediate desire, I shouldn't say that in the second service right before lunch,
[time=2389] the immediate desire is to eat.
[time=2393] And the ultimate desire says 17 pounds.
[time=2401] Do you see that tension? The immediate versus the ultimate.
[time=2405] The church banks at the same bank that we bank at, which means we don't even get a paycheck.
[time=2412] Our pay gets deposited right into a bank and we've got it set up so that so much of our money gets put into checking to pay bills to live off and so much of it goes into savings.
[time=2423] The checkings to meet our immediate needs and the savings are ultimate.
[time=2426] We're saving for this and that, a bigger house, we're filling ours.
[time=2429] You know, all these ultimate things that you save for in life.
[time=2433] And so automatically goes in immediate and this goes in ultimate.
[time=2437] Now, our bank has another little gizmo called a bank machine card.
[time=2441] In about the middle of the pay period, every week we go with our bank machine card, plug it in, plug in all these numbers and take out of savings, that which we put in.
[time=2450] After three years of savings, our account has swelled to somewhere close to $32.
[time=2456] Do you know why?
[time=2458] It's not that we don't get paid enough. We get paid fairly. We get paid well.
[time=2461] But we're constantly trading our ultimate for the immediate.
[time=2466] I don't know how many new houses have gone to the wayside for the one of a pizza with extra cheese.
[time=2473] Your laugh is not one that's laughing with me. I sense it's a laugh with me.
[time=2483] You know, we all are in that struggle.
[time=2485] What will do us the ultimate good and what we want to do for our immediate gratification very rarely in life are the same.
[time=2493] You know, the same thing is true spiritually.
[time=2497] That which our mind, our body, our will, what we want for today.
[time=2501] And what we want to get rid of today is based upon one thing.
[time=2505] We're only looking at our immediate situation and we're not looking at our ultimate situation.
[time=2511] And Paul says, "You and I've got to stop looking at the immediate and start looking at the ultimate." Here's how he says it.
[time=2519] He's talking about the afflictions of life today and he describes them in two ways.
[time=2523] First of all, he says they're light. They are.
[time=2527] Tribulation on every side, that's light, distress, that's light, persecution's light.
[time=2531] Getting knocked down is light, being shipwrecked is light, well, in comparison. It's light.
[time=2539] Second thing he said, it's momentary. I doubt that when Paul was floating out in the ocean for a day upon day and night upon night, he thought, oh, this is just, you know, regular splash party, the Romans are playing for me, which it could last longer.
[time=2551] No, I'm sure that it seemed in eternity as waves beat him down.
[time=2555] But in comparison, look how strategically he uses his vocabulary and phraseology to make the comparison. While the affliction is light, the glory is called a far more exceeding weight.
[time=2573] And the affliction, which is for a moment, is compared to the glory, which is forever, eternal.
[time=2583] You see, we all suffer a great number of things.
[time=2587] But if we can learn to look beyond our immediate pain, our immediate disappointment, our immediate hurts, and we look at the ultimate gain, then we're learning to develop an eternal perspective on life.
[time=2603] First, you've got to stop focusing the attention, which is so natural, and that which will gratify immediately, and that which will gratify ultimately.
[time=2615] Drama, athletics, and music are tremendous avenues to learn that truth.
[time=2623] I'm sure in Tom Snodgrass's lives there were days when the calluses on the fingers said quit, and he didn't, and ultimately he became a tremendous violinist. I'm sure there were days in the life of Leon and Emily Pippen as they put together a tremendous production of drama that they wanted to send the kids home and to quit.
[time=2651] They didn't, and they produced a tremendous play.
[time=2655] I'm sure there are days in the lives of the marathon runners that somewhere far before the 26-mile mark they wanted to quit, but Salazar did not, and he won.
[time=2667] There are days in our Christian life where we want to quit, because the immediate desire is to say I quit, but hang in there, far more exceeding eternal weight of glory.
[time=2683] If we're going to develop an eternal perspective in life, we must first learn to look at the inner man and not the outer man. Secondly, we must learn to look not at the immediate, but at the ultimate. And thirdly, verse 18, we must learn to look at the unseen and not the seen.
[time=2707] While we look not at the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. The best way I know to explain this to you is to ask you to turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 and following.
[time=2735] Now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
[time=2747] Paul says faith is the eye that sees that which cannot be seen and sees the evidence of that which is not even an existence yet, it's only hoped for. And now he's going to give some tremendous illustrations of that. Look at verse 7, "By faith Noah warned of God of things not seen as yet." You know what I think that phrase means? I believe it means that it had never rained on earth before. And God says Noah it's going to rain. As Bill Cosby would say, right.
[time=2783] What's rain? It's going to rain for 40 days and 40 nights. And I want you to build an ark three times the size of a football field. Let me ask you this.
[time=2795] How would you explain it? You know the guy, just think of the guy next door to you right now.
[time=2799] It's never rained and you're out in the back building an ark three times the size of a football field. Do you think you might have some questions?
[time=2807] But Moses, Abraham, Noah, all these men followed God in what was not seen. "By faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became the air of righteousness by faith." Moses, Abraham, Noah, they didn't see it but yet they believed in it and they followed it. Look at Abraham, verse 8, "By faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should go after and receive for an inheritance, obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went." Picture this. You're living rather affluently, rather comfortably and God comes and says, "I've got a new place I want to lead you to." I don't know about you but you know what my first question would be? Where? And God said, "Don't worry about it.
[time=2867] I've picked it out." And he went.
[time=2871] Not seeing where he was gone. Looking down at verse 24, Moses, "By faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the approach of Christ, richer than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward." You know what Moses did?
[time=2899] He left everything. He was considered Pharaoh's grandson and he was willing to leave that behind and become the leader of a group of slaves.
[time=2911] You know what's more amazing about that? Look at the next verse, "By faith he forsook Egypt fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing him who was invisible." No, a building arch when he'd never seen rain. Abraham went to a land that he had never seen and Moses followed a Christ that was invisible.
[time=2939] That's how you develop an eternal perspective on life.
[time=2943] As we take our attention and our mind and we focus it not on the things which are seen, but the things that are not seen.
[time=2955] Why? Because the things which are seen are temporal. Temporal means they only relate to life today, the good old here and now. I don't know how many times I've heard someone say, "I live for the good old here and now." I don't believe in any of this spot in the sky religion.
[time=2975] It reminds me of one who Jesus called a rich fool. A man who had had a bumper crop and his horns had become fulled overflowing so he built more barns, bigger barns, and he died.
[time=2991] What a brief and direct commentary, and he died. Someone's put it this way and it's probably something you've heard before.
[time=3003] Have you ever seen a hearse pulling a u-hollet?
[time=3007] That's what he means when he says the things that are seen are temporal. Nobody takes it with him.
[time=3015] But you know there are things that you can take with you if you live for the unseen, for the kingdom of God and for the glory of God. In chapter 5 verses 1 through 8, he holds forth a promise.
[time=3031] God, that's an awful lot to say. Don't live for the outward man.
[time=3035] Live for the inward man. Don't live for the immediate gratification. Live for the ultimate. Don't live for the scene. Live for the un... God, that's an awful lot to ask.
[time=3043] But he says, "For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens." Nobody's saying right there, he's saying this, that God will provide for us an eternity. An outward man that's mortality swallowed up with a new body.
