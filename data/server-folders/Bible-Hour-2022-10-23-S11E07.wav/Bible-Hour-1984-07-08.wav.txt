[time=0] [MUSIC - 897 seconds]
[time=917] Now as we return back to our worship service, we trust God will use this to encourage your heart.
[time=937] [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=1121] Thank you, Kevin, today to be reminded that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that he arose is the very foundation upon all that we believe today. We trust that you've come to worship the Lord Jesus Christ. If you've received him a Savior, this is an hour of worship. If you've not received Christ today, we welcome. With your inquisitive mind, you're welcome today to investigate the claims of Jesus Christ, to study his word, to see if it is not true.
[time=1150] To open its pages and to examine and to learn with us, we trust today that there's an openness to your heart. We pray that there is. Before we open up God's word to study today, we want to invite you to open your heart to him first of all in prayer.
[time=1168] Our Father, today we remember again the freedom that you have given to this land and the privilege that is ours to study your word. God, we're thankful today that we have assembled this morning. There's been no one at the doors to take names. There's no threat of political retribution. Just the freedom to assemble today.
[time=1194] God is free men. May we also know the freedom of soul, the freedom of sin being broken, the deliverance of the chains of bondage, falling free. Oh God today, we pray that as we would study your word that your spirit would take it in a marvelous, miraculous way,
[time=1217] apply it to each heart at its point of need. God, we think of that heart today that agonizes because of a deep hurt in their life. One that has hurt them in a way that they cannot describe even to their close friends. God, may they find that your spirit gives comfort and gives strength.
[time=1242] May they find that your word gives direction. God, we pray for that one today that life has been so blessed that they only know the wings of victory and it is an uncomfortable agonizing experience for them to even sit without focusing their attention on their conquest. God made today see themselves the way you see them.
[time=1269] Father we pray today that your word would become as real to us as our own life. For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1282] Stories told about a missionary who came home from the foreign field. He had given a number of reports to his home church and gone to dinner with the people of the church and one man just finally said to him, you know I've been listening to all that you've talked about.
[time=1297] How is it that you're able to tolerate and what do you do when you are just no longer can take all the superstition and all the violence and all the immorality? What do you do?
[time=1310] The missionary says, well when all the superstition and violence and immorality start to get to me, I just get on an airplane and go back to the foreign field.
[time=1321] You know there's somewhat of an indictment in that little humor isn't there? The keen awareness that all the things that we send missionaries to do over there to help with, to change their culture and their society for the better, all those things that the missionaries are supposed to change are becoming predominant
[time=1343] and characterizing this great way and the desires. Last week we studied in an overview, Joshua judges together. Those two books and how they fit together, Joshua the fulfillment that if the people of Israel would obey God they would no prosperity.
[time=1360] Judges, the fulfillment of God's word when he said if the people disobeyed God they would no punishment. In Judges chapters one and two we gave an outline of history, the history of the fall of Israel and we saw a progression, a movement through five different phases.
[time=1379] The first phase being found in Joshua chapter one verse one with a reminder that they were to remember God and judges one one saying that they forgot God.
[time=1391] The first phase of Israel's fall was their forgetfulness of God. That forgetfulness led them into a second phase, that phase being incomplete obedience.
[time=1402] That they were told to go into the land and drive out all the inhabitants but they only drove out part of the inhabitants. They were incomplete in their obedience, partial in their fulfillment of all that God had commanded them to do.
[time=1419] That incomplete obedience then led them to a third phase, a phase of compromise. Even though they had the military resources to drive out all the people, they instead compromised. They said we've got a better plan than God's got. God said to drive them out but we'll let them stay and then we'll charge them taxes and we'll finance our own expenditures out of their pockets.
[time=1443] And so they compromised with the people. But upon compromising then they found it expedient to move into a fourth phase, a phase of accommodation.
[time=1454] But they said now we've let these people stay in our land and we must understand that we are a pluralistic society and do not have the right to impose our values upon someone else.
[time=1466] So therefore we must accommodate these Canaanites within our borders and allow them to worship God as they see God.
[time=1473] And so they accommodated them by allowing their religious centers to remain, their altars to stand and their gods to rule over them.
[time=1485] That fourth phase of accommodation became so dominant that by the next generation Israel had become apostate.
[time=1495] And in that apostasy that spiritual fall in the way we saw the death of Israel.
[time=1502] What God was teaching in the book of Judges is that social, military, political and economic collapse are a result of a previous spiritual demise.
[time=1515] Chapters 1 and 2 give to us the spiritual demise of Israel.
[time=1520] As you open your Bibles to chapter 3 today we will see the result of that in the economic and social and military collapse of Israel because they first collapsed spiritually.
[time=1534] What we learned in Judges 1 and 2 last week was not simply an isolated event of history but it was a pattern that has been repeated throughout history.
[time=1546] H. G. Wells in his outline of Western history described the fall of Rome in a similar pattern that at first collapsed in terms of its moral fiber and then political and economic collapse followed.
[time=1562] They became a watchword for us even as we think of this privileged country of ours.
[time=1567] Today we're studying beginning in Joshua, I always say Joshua, we're studying Judges.
[time=1573] If I say Joshua you just stay right in Judges, okay?
[time=1577] In Joshua I did again.
[time=1582] In the book of Judges in the third chapter we will not make another reference to Joshua today so no matter what happens you stay in Joshua.
[time=1591] You know the amazing thing is I get paid to do this.
[time=1597] Last week in the summer Bible conference Ken took us to 13 verses and never found 1 Peter and now I can't seem to find the book of Judges.
[time=1608] But for those of you who are graduates of Bible college you know that it goes Josh with Judges and for those of you who went to some of the schools I went to it goes chapter 1, chapter 2, then chapter 3.
[time=1621] We're in Judges chapter 3 and in Judges chapter 3 we're going to be exposed to a incident in history that again was repeated time and time over.
[time=1635] Judges chapter 3 verse 6 reads as follows and they that means the Israelites took their daughters that means the Canaanites to be their wives and they also gave their daughters to the Canaanite sons and they serve their gods.
[time=1658] Verse 7 "The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and served Baalim and the groves.
[time=1670] Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel.
[time=1674] And he sold them into the land of Chuchain, Rishatha Eam, king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel served Chushan, Rishatha Eam eight years.
[time=1692] And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer to them who delivered them even Othniel."
[time=1704] A relatively short passage of the Bible seems to read only a lesson of history to be learned for those that like such abstract academics.
[time=1716] But actually what we've just read today was the first in a series of events in Israel's history during this period that we call the reign of the judges.
[time=1728] From that short passage we've read I'd like to give you today five steps in Israel's history.
[time=1737] The first one is found in verse 7 with this phrase Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. Mark that one in your mind to be rebellion.
[time=1746] What was the evil that they did? They replaced their allegiance to God with allegiance to new gods.
[time=1755] We speak of Baal. This particular passage speaks of Baalim. That is actually the word Baal and the little I am that follows simply means plural, the bales if you want to put it in the language of the new international version.
[time=1772] Baal was one particular God who seemed to be preeminent in the pantheon, the system of gods of the Middle East, but there were many, many gods.
[time=1783] And so they were called the bales or the baleen plural. In their system they had a different God that was associated with a different need.
[time=1794] Baal and Astrooth were considered the gods that brought fertility and prosperity to the land in agricultural terms.
[time=1802] And there was a different God that you worshiped when you had a different need.
[time=1806] Israel rebelled by rejecting God and following these other gods. Last week we spoke of the attraction, we spoke of the economic attraction.
[time=1819] The Israelites were forced up into the rocky, unculted, volable mountains. The Canaanites lived down in the lush, watered valleys.
[time=1830] The Canaanite crops grew much better because of the advantage of their soil.
[time=1835] But the Canaanites assured Israel if they just worshiped Baal then their crops would grow too.
[time=1840] So there was that economic attraction that prosperity would come if they simply worshiped the right God.
[time=1847] Secondly there was the social attraction. They were surrounded by all these Canaanites and they stuck out like a sore thumb.
[time=1855] They had a peculiar language and they so desperately wanted to fit in and not be viewed as different.
[time=1864] They just wanted to blend in with their culture. So socially they compromised.
[time=1870] Finally there was a sensual attraction because these gods called them to immorality.
[time=1876] And that's really the nature of idolatry.
[time=1880] Idolatry is not the making of an idol and worshiping that idol. That part of it is all ridiculous.
[time=1887] The reason why men and women make idols and worship them is because when you make your own God,
[time=1893] you can make your own God say words that you've chosen.
[time=1898] And when you worship the Lord God of heaven he chooses the words.
[time=1902] But when you make your own God you choose the words.
[time=1905] Therefore when your God speaks there's a predicted acceptability to what your God has to say.
[time=1915] These people rebelled. They rejected God because they really didn't like what God had to say about life.
[time=1923] Look at a step one rebellion. Step two is found in this phrase verse eight.
[time=1929] And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. Mark that step wrath.
[time=1938] Tonight in our evening service we'll study the topic problems and potential anger.
[time=1944] I don't want to steal what I have to share with you tonight.
[time=1949] But did you realize that anger is not necessarily sin?
[time=1955] And that the presence of anger is not necessarily bad, nor is the absence of anger necessarily good.
[time=1965] Here we discover that God becomes angry. That doesn't mean that God loses control of his character.
[time=1971] That means that God simply recognizes disobedience and there is a rejection within God's own emotion of disobedience.
[time=1984] And based upon that rejection God is going to act rationally, calmly, justly and definitively.
[time=1992] Which leads us to step three.
[time=1996] It says therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. Mark that wrath.
[time=2000] And step three and he sold them into the hand of the Mesopotamians.
[time=2006] Step three is retribution. Which means God retributes, re-attributes to them the just punishment for their rebellion.
[time=2020] In this particular case they were sold into the hands of the people of Mesopotamia.
[time=2025] A land far to the north nestled in the fertile crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
[time=2032] This powerful people came down and seized control of the land of Palestine.
[time=2038] And they forced the people into somewhat of a enslaved system.
[time=2043] They would go into the land, military occupy the land and extract taxes not necessarily in the form of money as much as in the form of commodities.
[time=2053] Although it wasn't the Mesopotamians were given great insight to this in the life of Gideon.
[time=2060] Gideon was thrashing wheat in the wine press which meant absolutely nothing to me as an urbanite.
[time=2068] Little history will help you. Whenever they wanted to thrash wheat they would go up onto a high hill.
[time=2075] The windiest spot they could find and they would throw the wheat up into the air.
[time=2079] And as they would throw the wheat up in the air the wind would blow away the chaffed and the wheat would fall to the ground.
[time=2085] So they would be up in a high place where the wind would blow.
[time=2089] When they wanted to press grapes in the wine they would go way down into the valley and they would dig a hole
[time=2095] and they would pour the grapes down into this deep hole and then they would go in and smash them.
[time=2100] And Gideon is standing down in the wine press trying to thrash wheat.
[time=2108] And the angel of the Lord comes unto him and says, "Hail, mighty man of valor."
[time=2114] Meaning great warrior, brave soul and here he is down there hiding and hoping these people wouldn't come
[time=2121] in their place whenever they found Israelites thrashing wheat.
[time=2125] They waited until they finished thrashing their wheat and then they came and took it.
[time=2129] Whenever the Israelites would go to press their grapes in that season they'd wait till they got impressed and they'd come and take it. In Israel was living under that type of bondage first by the Mesopotamians for an eight year period.
[time=2142] Now it was God's retribution on them for their rebellion.
[time=2147] That was step three. Step four is found in verse nine.
[time=2152] It says, "And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord." That's step four, repentance.
[time=2161] It finally dawned upon the nation of Israel that the economic and political destruction that they were receiving
[time=2170] was a result of their spiritual failures. And so they cried out to the Lord, they repented.
[time=2177] Which led to the fifth and final step, restoration.
[time=2181] And God raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them even off-neal.
[time=2191] Now there's an outline. Rebellion followed by wrath. Wrath is followed by retribution.
[time=2200] Retribution was followed by repentance on the part of the people.
[time=2204] The repentance on the part of the people was followed by God restoring them.
[time=2208] You see that's a marvelous plan. So all we have to do is to repent and we'll be restored.
[time=2215] I'm afraid the lesson isn't quite that simple.
[time=2219] Because this short little pattern that we've observed simply does not end with Israel being restored.
[time=2226] The tragedy of this situation in judges is that the people once they were restored went back to rebellion.
[time=2236] Look at verse 12, "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord."
[time=2245] That's exactly what we read, just in verse 7.
[time=2249] If you turn to chapter 4 verse 1 you'll read these words, "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord."
[time=2263] If you look at chapter 10 verse 6 you'll find that the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord.
[time=2275] The whole book of Judges is this five-point cycle again and again and again.
[time=2282] Chapter 3 verse 12 says they did evil, therefore God raised up because he was full of his wrath,
[time=2288] the Moabites, and the Moabites held Israel in oppression for eighteen years.
[time=2293] And then Israel cried out in the Lord in verse 3, 15, and when they repented God delivered them.
[time=2300] Chapter 4 speaks of Israel sinning again, God's wrath was incurred, this time God set the Canaanites against them,
[time=2308] and for twenty years they oppressed them.
[time=2311] Finally the people cried out in repentance and God sent Deborah, a judge, to deliver them.
[time=2318] In chapter 6 the evil was again a part of Israel's pattern, God was angry, God sent retribution, the people repented, God restored them.
[time=2330] Chapter 10 the same cycle, chapter 13 the same cycle, it follows again and again and again.
[time=2339] Now before we make some applications to our lives I want to make some generalized observations.
[time=2346] As we see these cycles occurring again and again in the nation of Israel there are some dangers to be observed.
[time=2353] The first is this, each time Israel sinned and was restored and then they sinned and they were restored and they sinned and they were restored,
[time=2363] each time the oppression became longer and more intense.
[time=2369] The first time it was eight years that they were under the hand of the Mesopotamians, the second time it was eighteen years that they were under the hand of the Moebites, the next time it was twenty years that they were under the hand of the Midianites,
[time=2384] then it was forty years they were under the hand of the Philistines, and then finally the final time they were again under the hand of the Philistines,
[time=2395] only they were never to be delivered again until the time of David.
[time=2401] Each time they went through that cycle the punishment and the oppression became longer and more intense,
[time=2410] mark that in your mind.
[time=2414] The second observation I'd like to make is this, each time they repented,
[time=2420] the quality, if you will, of their repentance was less and less.
[time=2429] To the point where in chapter eight verse thirteen, and that's worth turning to in the book of Judges,
[time=2435] I'm so proud I said that, right?
[time=2439] The pride goes before the false one due to St. Joshua any moment.
[time=2443] In Judges chapter eight verse thirty three it says, "And it came to pass," and here's the point, these next three little words, "and it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, the children of Israel turned again
[time=2460] and want a whoring after Baalim."
[time=2466] Previously they had repented and they walked in obedience to God for a number of years.
[time=2471] People went off and delivered them for forty years, they walked in obedience to God.
[time=2477] The next time when a man by the name of Ihah delivered them they walked in obedience to God for eighty years.
[time=2483] The next time when Deborah delivered them they walked in obedience for forty years.
[time=2488] They went through a cycle of minor judges till you come to Gideon.
[time=2491] By the time Gideon died their repentance was so limp that today Gideon died so did their faith in God.
[time=2500] A third observation.
[time=2505] As the quality of their repentance lessened so did the quality of their restoration.
[time=2512] When Othniel attacked the Mesopotamians he drove them out of the land he was victorious with them and over them.
[time=2521] By the time you come to the end of the judges you have men like Samson who are fighting the Philistines
[time=2529] and never completely successful.
[time=2533] The restoration is only a minor improvement.
[time=2539] A final observation at this point.
[time=2543] As the quality of the repentance lessened the quality of the restoration lessened
[time=2549] and the quality of the judges lessened.
[time=2553] It says of Othniel verse ten of chapter three and the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Israel and he went out to war and he delivered them.
[time=2564] You find a mighty conquering victorious man marked first of all by his complete possession by the spirit of the Lord.
[time=2575] Compare that to the last judge a man by the name of Samson characterized by his own spiritual deficiencies.
[time=2585] The major problem that faced Israel was found here in verse six when it says and they took their daughters to be their wives and they gave their daughters to their sons to be their wives.
[time=2597] Intermarriage was the chief practical problem that they faced and now rises up this strong man who is going to deliver Israel and who does he marry?
[time=2607] A Canaanite, a Philistine, Delilah.
[time=2614] Now why did we go through this lesson of history?
[time=2617] Well it's not because I was a history major in college and I wanted to afflict you with the things that I was afflicted of.
[time=2624] But because I believe there are some key transferable concepts to all that we've studied so far.
[time=2629] I believe that God has this put in his word that you and I might draw an analogy.
[time=2634] And the analogy might be that the pattern that hit Israel if we do not guard ourselves will hit you and I as individual believers.
[time=2646] Israel was held possessed by a cycle of sin and so are most Christians today.
[time=2655] We are held possessed trapped and bound in a cycle of sin.
[time=2663] What I'd like to do is to make some brief suggestions as to lessons that we can learn that will help us to break the cycle of sin that we often are trapped in.
[time=2679] I want to be honest.
[time=2682] I'm going to share four or five points and these four or five points are in no way a spiritual antidote that's going to keep sin from ever hitting your life.
[time=2691] Nor do I want to suggest to you that there's four or five easy steps to overcoming sin.
[time=2697] It's not like the back of the instant oatmeal box at three easy steps to oatmeal that your kids won't eat.
[time=2706] It's going to imply hard work.
[time=2709] And too many times you and I as Christians are spoon fed simple solutions when there are none.
[time=2715] Yet I believe there are general principles when obeyed and work through bring about spiritual prosperity.
[time=2723] The first thing that I want to suggest in breaking the cycle of sin is this.
[time=2728] That you and I must realize that we are 100% responsible for our behavior.
[time=2739] Many of us have grown up under the influence of humanistic philosophy that has much to be said positive but much to be warned against on the negative side.
[time=2752] One of the chief tenants of humanistic philosophy is that man in mankind men and women are basically good and if left to themselves will do good things.
[time=2766] And the only time that we noble humans do bad things is when we are adversely influenced by our bad environment.
[time=2779] That is true to a minor degree and we have majored on the minors.
[time=2785] What is not true is that men and women are basically good.
[time=2789] The Bible says that we're basically evil and left to ourselves we will become increasingly evil and increasingly more self-oriented.
[time=2797] What is not true is that we would only do bad things if someone was there to influence.
[time=2803] I am convinced that if I was put upon an island by myself and Satan was bound I would come up with some evil that I could do.
[time=2813] I'm convinced that's true of every human because our nature the Bible says is sinful.
[time=2819] It is true that we're strongly influenced by our environment.
[time=2823] Statistics will show that if you grow up in a home with a father who is abusive and batters the mother and the children,
[time=2830] there is a strong likelihood that that child in that home will grow up to reproduce that same deviant behavior.
[time=2836] That is a learned behavior.
[time=2840] However simply because it was a part of our environment does not eliminate us from moral responsibility.
[time=2847] And you and I will never break the cycles of sin that possess us until we are willing to agree with God that we are responsible for our behavior.
[time=2859] Usually we do one of two things with our behavior.
[time=2863] We either try to justify it or we try to minimize it.
[time=2869] I know that I shouldn't have done that and I really didn't want to do it and I didn't mean to do it and I wouldn't have done it if you first hadn't said.
[time=2878] You know what that conversation does? That says I wasn't responsible. You see I was only reacting to what you did.
[time=2886] Therefore it is surely your fault.
[time=2891] That's justifying our behavior because of the influence of someone else.
[time=2896] The great theologian philosopher Flip Wilson said it best. The devil made me do it.
[time=2903] And that's what we constantly want to do is to find an excuse for our wrong behavior outside of ourselves.
[time=2912] Or we try to minimize it. Well I know but you know where I work that's just how everybody does it.
[time=2920] If you were in this business you would do it too and it's not all that big a thing because everybody minimizing it.
[time=2928] We want to take the standards and add two parts water and minimize it and reduce it down to a socially acceptable level.
[time=2939] We will never have victory over the cycles of sin until we come face to face with the reality that we're responsible for our behavior
[time=2947] and that the only cure is dealing with us because you will never be able to change your environment.
[time=2954] Step two is this. You must recognize that this is a lifelong spiritual battle.
[time=2963] Overcoming sin in our lives is a lifelong spiritual battle.
[time=2971] God delivered Israel under Othniel. Did that mean they were delivered forever? No. They fell.
[time=2977] God delivered them under Man by the name of Ihud. Did that mean they were delivered forever? No they fell.
[time=2983] And God delivered them under Deborah and God delivered them under Gideon. God delivered them under Samson.
[time=2988] God delivered them under Samuel and they fell again and again and again.
[time=2992] And the point is this. Delivery over sin in our lives is never full and complete.
[time=2998] It is an ongoing process, a continual battle.
[time=3004] And it's very popular today to hear somebody give a testimony who says, "Oh I used to have this terrible problem and then God delivered me."
[time=3014] It's tragically insightful to follow up those deliveries a few years later.
[time=3019] And you'll discover that they have returned to the same sin that previously possessed them.
[time=3026] Seneca, the Roman, not a Christian said, "Oh that a hand would come down from heaven and deliver me from my besetting sin."
[time=3036] Most of us today think that's what God promises to do in his word. God says if we just simply ask him, he'll come.
[time=3042] He'll change us and we'll never have a problem with that sin again. That is not true.
[time=3047] Israel faced the problems again and again and again and you and I will face them again and again and again.
[time=3053] It is a self-deception or perhaps a satanic deception that once we overcome sin we're done and it's all settled.
[time=3062] We need to brace ourselves for an ongoing battle and that's why God had the quartermaster issue the armor of Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=3072] Because the battle is not over, it is just getting started.
[time=3076] You need to brace yourself with a commitment that says I'm going to fight this battle continuously.
[time=3084] Erwin Lutzer in his excellent book How to Say No to a Stubborn Habit with the subtitle when you feel like saying yes.
[time=3092] Said that Satan poses before us two lies but one at a time.
[time=3099] Lie number one Lutzer said, and I think correctly as this, that Satan appeals to us and plants in our mind this thought.
[time=3108] It may not be right but it's all right to do it just once.
[time=3113] I mean the only way you'll know is to try and if it's not right then I'll know for sure after I've tried and it's my life.
[time=3119] I've got to experiment. I've got to find out for myself. It's all right to try it. Just this once.
[time=3127] And after you swallow lie one he slips in lie two which goes like this.
[time=3133] Well you've already done it once. You've already done it. You've lost your character.
[time=3139] You've lost your integrity. You've lost your purity. You can never have those things back so you might as well do it again now.
[time=3146] It's too late. And we enter into the cycle of sin.
[time=3155] The other thing that I want to suggest that we do is that we repent thoroughly from our sin and not just from the consequences of our sin.
[time=3167] If you'll read the book of Judges you'll find one glowing hole. One missing ingredient and that is Israel always repented of the consequences of their sin.
[time=3181] You never recommitted themselves to following God.
[time=3188] Once they receive punishment from their sin they say all we've sinned against God. We repent.
[time=3195] But you never read and they gave their heart holy to the Lord.
[time=3200] You know that stopping from sin is absolutely worthless in your life. God could care less that you stop sinning if you don't start living for him.
[time=3210] You see to repent and to turn away from sin but not turn to God is really nothing.
[time=3219] You must repent completely.
[time=3224] Fourth thing is this. You need to recognize your own personal areas of weakness.
[time=3234] Some of you may struggle with your tongue. Others may struggle with your temper. Some of you may struggle with money.
[time=3241] Others of you may struggle with morality. But you need to know what your area of temptation is and to face it and to deal with it specifically.
[time=3253] What do you mean by that is found in Israel's problem? They had one particular problem that reoccurred again and again.
[time=3262] Their problem was the temptation to follow other gods. What they should have done is once they realize that sin they should have removed themselves from the sin as far as possible.
[time=3273] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Art today.
[time=3280] Could it be that as a result of today's broadcast you've come to a point in your life where you need to make a spiritual decision?
[time=3287] A decision to invite Jesus Christ in your life.
[time=3292] You and I must.
[time=3296] Let's do not struggle with God's leading you to do that.
[time=3303] My limited experience in counseling reveals that when I see people I realize that I see them repeatedly.
[time=3308] I believe Jesus Christ is your son to the tragedy that he died for mold.
[time=3313] I ask him to come into my ground to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3317] Tragedy in his name I pray.
[time=3319] Because our nature is that you may be strong if you may be strong if you may be strong.
[time=3326] If we can find out the fact that you've just made a decision to grow and then Jesus Christ.
[time=3331] If you have a copy of that just simply write to us at the Bible Hour.
[time=3335] And then earlier in today's broadcast we also offered the booklet.
[time=3338] Craig Massey is an excellent book.
[time=3340] Either just or simply shares a little Bible Hour box is worthy of our repetition.

[time=3357] One is cursed at tape number 11, the other 42.
[time=3361] Please send a gift to $3 the other I hate the cost of sending this date.
[time=3366] Once again our address is the Bible Hour.
[time=3369] There are two natures within us.
[time=3371] There's our human nature which has a predisposition to self.
[time=3374] Eight, one, five.
[time=3376] When we receive Jesus Christ there's a new nature of the spirit of God that comes in that has a predisposition.
[time=3381] The Bible Hour has been made possible by the goodness of the founders' club.
[time=3384] A group of committed Christians who regularly support this unreached ministry.

[time=3402] Now speaking for pastor Rick Hartz.
[time=3404] God is we come to an end of service.
[time=3406] We pray it will not be the end of service every week of this time for the Bible Hour.
[time=3410] God, I pray that the things that I've discovered in your word will be hammered into the soul.
[time=3417] I pray for each one of us to recount the rising cost of health care.
[time=3422] I'm going to tell you about Medicare Protector 84.
[time=3426] A newly available plan that pays 100% of Medicare Part A.
[time=3430] Plus Medicare Part B.

[time=3435] And it pays 90% of all prescription drugs after $100 deductible.
[time=3439] Up to $1,000 per year, plus Medicare Protector 84 will pay up to $4.50 per day for nursing home benefits from the 21st to the 80th day of confinement.
[time=3449] Not fall into the tragic cycle of 30 a month.
[time=3452] With Medicare Protector 84 will only pay expenses not covered by Medicare and/or this policy.
[time=3457] If you're Medicare age, you don't have to worry about rising health care costs.

[time=3509] One ruling in particular has upset some of the court's critics and especially civil libertarians.
[time=3515] It was that in a few specific cases the police have seized illegally can be used in court to prosecute a person accused of a crime.
[time=3525] And other rulings from the murder supreme court, as we sing, God's leaves, you come to be sang.
