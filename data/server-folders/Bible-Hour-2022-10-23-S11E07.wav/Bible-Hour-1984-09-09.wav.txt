[time=0] and even hint with expectation about our future.
[time=8] Here's Jerry Hoffman, our narrator, to help us as we reflect.
[time=13] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=34] The Black Hawk Baptist Church began 15 years ago today, in 1969.
[time=38] The Bible Hours started five years later, in 1974.
[time=41] Today, we celebrate these two anniversaries.
[time=45] Black Hawk had its beginnings in the Immanuel Baptist Church.
[time=48] Seven families from Immanuel called a young pastor by the name of David Jeremiah.
[time=53] Using three mobile units, the Black Hawk Baptist Church opened its doors and began its historic ministry on September 7, 1969.
[time=61] From the outset, God began to work in the hearts of these people and to use their dynamic pastor to reach out to a growing community.
[time=69] In 1970, the small congregation began the construction of a sanctuary.
[time=73] This facility, which we now call the chapel, functioned as our sanctuary for five years beginning in 1971.
[time=80] In 1972, grounds broken for an educational wing.
[time=84] This facility provided much needed classrooms for our Sunday school and the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=90] In 1975, construction began on Phase III, our Convocation Center.
[time=95] As with the previous facilities, it was to be a multi-purpose facility.
[time=100] The term multi-purpose, however, seems inadequate to describe the almost continuous utilization of this facility.
[time=108] Along with the addition of new people and facilities to accommodate them, a number of new ministries were born.
[time=115] In 1973, the Black Hawk Christian School began.
[time=119] It started with four dedicated teachers and 39 students in grades pre-kindergarten through fourth.
[time=124] Additional grades were added each year until 1980-81 when we graduated our first class of seniors.
[time=131] In September 1974, the television ministry was born.
[time=135] When borrowed in often unreliable cameras, the church began a weekly, live telecast of its worship service.
[time=141] In 1975, the program came to be known as the Heritage Hour, and later, as the Bible Hour.
[time=147] In 1976, the TV ministry was able to purchase new equipment, concurrent with the congregation's move into the Convocation Center.
[time=155] Using the brand new cameras and equipment for the first time, the entrance into the new sanctuary was shared with our TV viewers.
[time=162] I'm Pastor David Jeremiah from the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and we're celebrating today a very historic event in the history of our fellowship.
[time=170] We're moving from an old building that we've occupied for about three years into a brand new Convocation Center.
[time=177] We're glad that we're able to share even the march into the new building with you, our many friends, and we trust that you'll stay tuned and share with us now the Heritage Hour television program as we worship together for the first time in the Black Hawk Baptist Church Convocation Center.
[time=193] In 1978, God called George and Mary Lattman to the Black Hawk staff.
[time=201] They were challenged to initiate a ministry to senior adults, which would be called Super 60s.
[time=208] Also in 1978, the alive counseling ministry began under the leadership of Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=215] This ministry applied both the principles of God's Word and a thorough understanding of psychology.
[time=222] Special musical events have had an important role in the history of Black Hawk.
[time=226] The annual patriotic panorama was started in 1974.
[time=230] And in November 1975, the church produced a prime time Thanksgiving special.
[time=235] In 1976, the Christmas musical Ring the Bells was also produced.
[time=239] December 1977 marked the first living Christmas tree.
[time=243] This special event has continued year after year and is one of the most popular Christmas traditions in a Fort Wayne area.
[time=250] Yes, the special ministries of Black Hawk have certainly played an important role.
[time=254] It is often through them that individuals are introduced to Black Hawk.
[time=258] Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the core ministry of the church, its underlying strength has always been the preaching and teaching of God's Word.
[time=267] Pastor David Jeremiah, dynamic leader of the new church and its pastor for the first 12 years, established a high standard of quality in his exposition of God's Word.
[time=278] But there are many other support ministries that help to produce a complete, well-rounded church program.
[time=285] Sunday School has been an important ministry, even from that first Sunday in 1969.
[time=290] Beginning at the nursery age and continuing through preschool, elementary, high school and adult, students are taught the practical principles of God's Word.
[time=299] The youth ministry began under the leadership of Jim Elliot.
[time=302] In 1977, the church hired a young seminary student by the name of Rick Hawks to become the youth pastor.
[time=308] Rick brought both great enthusiasm and a sensitive heart.
[time=312] Though special music has played an important role in Black Hawk's program, it is our own choir and our own special musicians that week in, week out, prepare our hearts for worship.
[time=323] Through the years we have enjoyed the musical leadership of John Case, Pete Colby, Don Kruger, and again, Pete Colby.
[time=331] Realizing that most Christians feel unprepared to share their faith in Christ, Black Hawk initiated an evangelism training class.
[time=339] Students are taught a simple outline of the gospel and are given the opportunity to share their faith in real life situations.
[time=348] Beginning with Dan and Judy Smith in 1970, the church now supports over 30 missionaries around the world, many from our own church.
[time=356] Annual Mission's conferences provide the opportunity for us to hear firsthand reports from missionaries and to challenge our own hearts concerning missions.
[time=365] Certainly there is much more to the history of Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=371] and the Bible Hour than we've been able to share in the last few minutes.
[time=375] Before we look to the future, let us highlight our past through the medium of music.
[time=380] Thanks to the Bible Hour Ministry, we have been able to preserve these specials from the period of September 1975 through the summer of 1982.
[time=389] Watch, listen, and reflect.
[time=394] Why should I feel discouraged?
[time=405] There is a name I love to hear.
[time=414] In Jesus' name, praise to the Lord!
[time=422] Our King, praise to you.
[time=428] A dear earth that all this old world can impart.
[time=437] I love the thrill that I feel when I get together with God's wonderful people.
[time=445] But I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[time=459] Jesus is my Lord's name.
[time=472] Jesus is my Lord's name, praise to you.
[time=494] Stepping on shore and finding it heaven.
[time=524] Where have you been?
[time=537] Where are you going?
[time=555] Where is my sword, the King of Heaven?
[time=567] It's time of love, it's just for you that you can sing, sing some of love.
[time=578] Let's sing our song, sing some of love.
[time=585] How long is my light and my salvation?
[time=596] Yes, Jesus cares.
[time=606] We didn't know that it was for our sins, we died, that for us the Son of God was crucified.
[time=621] Come unto Jesus, give him your life today.
[time=635] Amazing place, how sweet the Son is.
[time=647] There are hearts more bound by sorrow.
[time=654] It's a great, great morning.
[time=656] You're for stay in Heaven when you stroll down the Golden Avenue.
[time=661] Jesus made a Lord.
[time=669] This is the day that the Lord hath made, rejoice and be glad.
[time=674] You've got to tell it everywhere, everywhere.
[time=680] You've got to tell it, you've got to share it.
[time=684] Bless the Lord of my Son, and all that is within me.
[time=695] Just to know his leading in my life is.
[time=702] And know he taught me how to live.
[time=710] I told him how to die.
[time=716] Some men try so hard to prove that God's not really real.
[time=728] One been aimlessly, thirsty andlessly.
[time=732] All I found was fill and water from an earthly stream.
[time=737] If I could find the right words to say.
[time=747] Oh, we've come this far by faith, leaning on the Lord.
[time=757] As we said at the outset, reflecting on the past often gives us a better perspective on the future.
[time=764] Certainly, Blackhawk has had an exciting history, but we believe the future can be even greater.
[time=770] Let us take these last few minutes to see what God is doing today at Blackhawk and through the Bible hour.
[time=779] Dale Johnson, our business manager, heads the business office and directs our staff of maintenance and clerical personnel.
[time=788] Terry Lake and Lloyd Hicks, two of our members, both of whom have master's degrees, now provide counseling services through the Alive Counseling Center.
[time=799] Each Sunday, the Bible hour takes our worship service into thousands of homes in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=805] Thanks to the faithful support of our Founders Club members and special gifts of many friends, the Bible hour has recently been able to purchase a character generator and editing equipment.
[time=815] This equipment has made it possible for us to produce this special.
[time=820] We are now looking forward to expanding the Bible hour into South Bend or Chicago.
[time=826] Each week, someone in the community stops me and tells me how God has used the Bible hour in their life or the lives of their family.
[time=834] I believe God is going to continue to use television to spread his word.
[time=839] Personally, I'm excited about God's plans for the Bible hour in the days ahead.
[time=844] The difficulties facing our youth seem to be more severe with each passing year.
[time=849] We are grateful to have John Sootch directing our youth program.
[time=852] As you can see behind me, young people are alive and energetic.
[time=856] We're excited about God's word and its potential to work in their lives as they seek to reach the world for Jesus Christ in today.
[time=864] Under the leadership of George and Mary Lampman, Super 60's has grown from a small group in 1978 to over 600 who attended the 5th anniversary last fall.
[time=873] Super 60's provides a time of fellowship, encouragement, spiritual blessing, and meets each Friday at 10 o'clock and invites all senior adults in a Fort Wayne community to attend.
[time=887] They enjoy fellowship around the table with a meal.
[time=890] Mary and I and Black Hawk are excited about Super 60's.
[time=895] In the spring of this year, Black Hawk Christian School received full accreditation from the Indiana State Department of Education.
[time=902] Now in its 12th year, the school has always operated on a philosophy of academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=910] It offers a variety of extracurricular activities including sports and drama.
[time=916] I believe it is important for our students to be taught the academic fundamentals.
[time=921] We want them to be prepared to go to college or choose a vocation that they would like.
[time=926] Also, we feel it is very important that they receive instruction in Godly character to develop that for their future.
[time=932] We're excited about what we can do in our school this year to provide those two things.
[time=937] Music is one of the most public forms of worship and service.
[time=941] As in the past, the emphasis is on both the message and the quantity of the music.
[time=954] It's been a thrill for my family and me to come back to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=958] Our people are really committed, especially as it relates to our music program and our specials presented annually.
[time=964] I'm really excited about the fall music program here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=971] Seventeen men now serve on our board of deacons. Working with Rick and our staff, they organize and conduct the flop ministry
[time=979] and oversee the financial and administrative details of our church.
[time=983] We certainly appreciate the faithfulness of this congregation.
[time=988] We at Black Hawk have been truly blessed with a special group of people.
[time=993] We as a board of deacons feel that the best days of the church are still ahead. We are all genuinely excited about the future of this church.
[time=1002] Black Hawk's flop ministry breaks the large congregation into small flop groups, each led by a flop deacon.
[time=1011] This keeps the big church small.
[time=1014] If you're looking for friends and for fellowship at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, we really urge you to be a part of the flop ministry.
[time=1022] It needs on Sunday mornings during Sunday school.
[time=1025] We're excited about the flop ministry and we believe that there's a place for you to be a part of it too.
[time=1031] And last but not least, God has blessed us with a sensitive, tender-hearted pastor and a person of Rick Hawks.
[time=1039] Who can forget their early impressions of this young, curly-haired seminary student as he headed our youth program, read the scripture each week, taught our evangelism class, and served as our interim pastor.
[time=1053] We as a congregation are grateful that he accepted our call in February 1983 to become senior pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1063] Each week, Rick opens God's Word and with Transparent Honesty provides us with practical challenges for our daily lives.
[time=1073] As we bring this special presentation to a close, let's listen to a word from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=1081] It is really a privilege for me to be the pastor of this faithful group of people here at Black Hawk.
[time=1088] We've truly had a remarkable first 15 years, but the past was then and we live in the today and we're expecting about the future.
[time=1098] I hope you'll join me in adopting this spirit of the Apostle Paul when he said I pressed towards the high mark of the calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=1108] We're excited about the power of Jesus Christ to change lives today.
[time=1112] But rather than me tell you about that, we've asked a few of our friends here to share with you exactly what Jesus Christ means in their lives.
[time=1121] I accepted the Lord as my personal Savior when I was 12 years old through the Sunday school teacher.
[time=1127] She and I still once in a while have contacted, she lives in this area, and I got away from him as the center of my life as I got a little older.
[time=1137] And we attended church, but he wasn't vital in my decision making in my goal setting.
[time=1145] And we came back to Fort Wayne and joined Black Hawk Baptist Church, and I'm very thankful for the ministry here because it again put Jesus at the center of my life, and he is once again my very best friend.
[time=1161] A few years ago, my son started attending Black Hawk Christian School. My wife and I were very excited with what he learned about Jesus Christ.
[time=1169] Through the media of the Bible hour and Bible study with Pastor Rick and active participation in church functions, we too accepted Christ in our heart.
[time=1180] We now know that God has a plan for our life.
[time=1185] My mother took me to Sunday school and I was a little girl and I learned the Ten Commandments and the books of the Bible which really comes in handy now when I'm studying.
[time=1193] And I grew up believing that I was a Christian. If I did all the right things, I went to church on Sunday that maybe God would accept me someday and that I would hopefully be good enough in his eyes.
[time=1203] Well, a few years ago, people started coming into my life who had a different idea of what it meant to be a Christian.
[time=1209] They had a personal relationship with God and that's something I'd never heard about. When my husband and I visited some Sunday school classes where they teach the Bible, and we found out that we can have a personal relationship with God and that he does forgive us and that we can have eternal life through him.
[time=1226] And it wasn't long until I accepted Christ as my personal Savior. And you know that piece that passes all understanding? Well, it really is yours if you have this relationship with Christ.
[time=1237] I was 22 years old, a junior at the University of Minnesota, when a friend in my dormitory confronted me with the claims of Jesus Christ.
[time=1247] I made a decision at that period of time, but now some 35 years later, the question frequently asked me is, "Is it relative to date? Does it really mean something?"
[time=1257] And I guess I'm here to say that at the center of my life, who I am as a person, my relationship with my family and my wife, it's he's more than sufficient.
[time=1266] In my career, who I am as a businessman, as a penny manager, I'm anxious to say and I'm excited to say that it's been exciting as he's provided opportunities for ministry where we've gone.
[time=1277] And finally in the area of crisis, in the last couple years of my life, I've had some kind of life threatening things happen.
[time=1283] Once again, we've found that God is faithful and more than sufficient. So I guess probably after 35 years, I'd say it's great to be a Christian.
[time=1292] As I mentioned earlier, it is truly a privilege for me to pastor this group of people.
[time=1297] We've had a remarkable past, but our future is yet ahead of us.
[time=1301] And I'm confident that God is going to continue to use the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour in the days ahead.
[time=1309] Our best days are still before us.
[time=1322] [MUSIC]
[time=1328] You know, Pete, I have to tell you, watching that video presentation has really touched my heart today.
[time=1335] In the last two weeks, the technicians have been reviewing all the tapes that we've had in the last 10 years of the Bible Hour Ministry,
[time=1342] and it was really exciting to see all of the people that have contributed to blessing our hearts at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1349] You know, this morning about 730, Dale Siglin, our producer and director of the television ministry and of the media that we've just seen,
[time=1356] played that for me, and both he and I were a little choked up, and right now it's even hard for me to talk about it,
[time=1362] because we really have sense that God has done something unusual in the way of blessing upon this church and the ministry of the Bible
[time=1369] and we just are taking this time to praise him and to thank him for what he has done.
[time=1374] And we want to thank you for your hard work because music has been the driving force of many of the things that have happened around here.
[time=1381] Well, it's a privilege to be cooperating with your ministry in preaching the Word and getting the people prepared through music,
[time=1389] because I believe it does do that, and hopefully we can continue just bringing forth the Word through the Bible Hour.
[time=1397] You know, the Word of God is the bottom line, and it's not just a matter of us sharing it and the song or preaching it,
[time=1403] it's really when it gets into your lives that makes the difference.
[time=1406] That's why we encourage you to write today for timeless insights.
[time=1410] This is a daily devotional tool that will help you to become a better student of God's Word, but not just a student,
[time=1417] a better liver of God's Word.
[time=1419] Someone said God didn't give us His Word to increase our knowledge, but to change our lives.
[time=1424] And if you want to have the full impact of God's Word in your life, then you need to be studying it day in and day out.
[time=1431] Timeless Insights is a tool designed to help you do that.
[time=1434] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you absolutely free this copy of a daily devotional guide that begins with the Book of Matthew on October 1st.
[time=1443] So we just have these few days for you to write in and for us to send it back to you.
[time=1447] You write to us today and we'll send it to you free.
[time=1450] Pete, would you share with our people how they can get their copy?
[time=1453] Yes, you can receive timeless insights by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1463] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1470] Well, Pete, as we go back to the live part of our morning service, we have our special guest, Roger Strader, with us.
[time=1476] Why don't you just share with our people a little bit about who Roger is.
[time=1479] Well, we've been writing quite a while for Roger. We had him scheduled in May and he wasn't feeling well the Sunday he was supposed to be here.
[time=1486] But he came in from Scottsdale, Arizona yesterday and trust had a good rest last night.
[time=1491] And he's here to minister to us not only this morning, but tonight he'll have a 40-minute concert in our evening service, which begins at 6 o'clock.
[time=1498] And we invite all our viewers to come and join us in the sanctuary here for a great time of music with Roger Strader.
[time=1505] Roger is not only a singer, but a fine composer among the music that he's written.
[time=1511] We've done "King of Love at Christmas" here and "Prince of Peace." He's written "Daystar" and a number of songs that have really blessed particularly our people's hearts.
[time=1520] Well, thank you, and we're looking forward to seeing and hearing from Roger in just a moment.
[time=1525] And we trust that God will use this service to strengthen your faith.

[time=1771] Praising the Lord was something that I learned early on in my Christian life
[time=1777] and my walk with him.
[time=1781] Why God has chosen me to be here in front of you
[time=1788] is a mystery that only he knows the answer to.
[time=1793] But yet I'm so grateful that he has allowed and afforded me this opportunity
[time=1801] to serve him through the wonderful medium of music and I thank him.
[time=1808] But yet I don't understand completely why out of all of the millions and the billions of people that have come and grown across the face of this earth he chose me and that he chose you to be here and to be part of his family.
[time=1826] I think if we think about it long enough we'll never be able to understand but yet God does love us and it's our responsibility to serve and to walk with him each day.
[time=1847] Why have you chosen me out of millions?
[time=1856] You're a child to be, you know all the wrong that I've done.
[time=1870] Oh how could you pardon me?
[time=1877] Forgive my iniquity to save me

[time=2210] and in his presentation he told of a fellow congressman a man who had a little boy about ten years old and the little boy was always telling his dad
[time=2220] when I grow up I want to be a dad and a hockey player and a lawyer and a congressman
[time=2227] the congressman was so proud of his son that he wanted to be all of those things and particularly a congressman like his father
[time=2235] dad when I grew up I want to be a dad and a hockey player and a lawyer and a congressman
[time=2242] after saying that for a few years the proud congressman father had his little boy with him one day
[time=2249] said to a fellow congressman come over here and he said son tell our colleague here what you want to be when you grow up
[time=2255] and he said I want to be a dad and a hockey player and a lawyer
[time=2262] and the congressman said well son tell him what else you want to be he said just those things well I thought you said you you wanted to be a congressman too
[time=2271] he said no dad you can't be a dad and be a congressman both well that's powerful isn't it that's powerful
[time=2281] here was a man who was called into the leadership of his district to represent them in the government that leads our country
[time=2289] but his involvement in his career his job so consumed every area of his life that his 11 year old son would say no dad
[time=2302] you can't be a dad and a congressman both the individual who is so consumed by their work that everything else in life gets pushed out
[time=2315] is what we have popularized as a workaholic now to be honest with you I don't like the term workaholic
[time=2322] I define a workaholic as anyone who works harder than I do you see I'm the one who's in balance
[time=2329] anyone who works less than I do lacks initiative anyone who works more than I do is a workaholic
[time=2336] I don't like those terms because we often pin somebody else and we label that guy our my boss is our my partner next to me he's a driver you know he's out of balance
[time=2347] maybe you're saying my husband is my father is God's word I believe speaks very directly to this issue of being a workaholic
[time=2357] in Ecclesiastes chapter 2 so if you have your Bible with you open it that you can study with us this morning from Ecclesiastes the second chapter
[time=2368] here Solomon describes his life at a given point and I think it was at the point where he was functioning as a workaholic
[time=2377] now let me give you a layman's definition of what a workaholic is I believe a workaholic is any individual whose work obsessively demands of them so much time that it leads to the neglect of personal balance in life
[time=2394] the neglect of family relationships and the neglect of their relationship with God and Ecclesiastes chapter 2 I believe Solomon describes his life when he was at that particular point
[time=2409] verse 17 therefore I hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
[time=2426] yay I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool
[time=2442] yet he shall have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored and therein I have shown myself wise under the sun this also is vanity
[time=2456] therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair for all the labor which I took under the sun
[time=2464] for there is a man whose labor is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion
[time=2476] this also is vanity and a great evil for what hath man of all of his labor and all of his vexation of heart where any hath labored under the sun for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief
[time=2493] yay is heart takeeth not rest in the night this also is vanity there is nothing better for a man than he should eat and drink him that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor
[time=2508] this also I saw that it was from the hand of God for who can eat or who else can hasten here to more than I for God give it to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy
[time=2523] but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather up and to heap up that he may give it to him that is good before God this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
[time=2538] and in overview ecclesiastes is the search for what gives life its purpose its significance its value Solomon began in chapter one assuming that it would be knowledge and wisdom so in chapter one he says I want out to accumulate knowledge to show myself why thinking that in my wisdom then my life would have value and significance
[time=2561] here's how he ends chapter one for much wisdom is much grief and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow basically he was saying knowledge and wisdom isn't where its at
[time=2577] Solomon was gifted by God with extraordinary wisdom it may be fair to say that he was the wisest man of all time but yet he said in his overflowing wisdom wisdom gives no substance to life
[time=2590] so he switches in chapter two he says I went through that segment of my life and I entered into my first midlife crises and he said I thought that pleasure would be what gives life its value its its sense of the gusto I was looking for
[time=2607] and so in chapter two he says I pursued pleasure I heaped upon myself every pleasure that a man could know and here's what he says at the end of that quest
[time=2616] in chapter two verse eleven then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought on the labor which I had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vex station of spirit and there was no profit under the sun
[time=2631] his pleasure he literally worked hard at pleasure and he said it was nothing it was empty then he says in chapter two verses twelve through sixteen
[time=2643] well if its not knowledge and if its not pleasure it must be just playing the laxadaisical role of the fool I mean let go and don't worry about it just kick back
[time=2653] case eros eros whatever will be will be he said but in folly it was all like chasing after the wind so now he comes to chapter two verse seventeen he said work that's it I'll pour my life into my work and I will labor and I will be of success
[time=2672] I will get ahead and I will accumulate and I will store up and then I will be significant my life will have security I will have acceptance and value through my work that's how I'll do it
[time=2688] notice what he says in verse seventeen and so I hated life verse eighteen I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun I found at least six descriptions here of the workaholic
[time=2706] I want to share those with you very briefly this morning and tonight in our evening service we'll call it the workaholic a deeper look and we're going to look at these a little deeper
[time=2715] but just in a passing way the first characteristic of the workaholic is what we've already seen in Solomon he is the individual who has a total commitment to his work
[time=2725] the workaholic is the individual who says I am going to arrive my meaning out of life my significance who I am my statement to this world is going to be my work and there's a total commitment to that that drives out everything else
[time=2741] work becomes all together not only dominant and predominant but solitary in terms of our perspective
[time=2753] I asked a man one time I said maybe we can get together play golf very smugly almost with an air of pride he said I don't have time to play golf
[time=2766] I said do you like tennis no I don't participate in any of those things you see I'm really committed I wanted to say I'm not very courageous but what I wanted to say was committed to what dying early
[time=2780] that's the workaholic the individual says I'm just going to dive into my work and then I'll find my existence meaningful Solomon warns that isn't where you find your existence meaningful
[time=2795] first characteristic Solomon brings to our attention is the individual who says my work is my total commitment second characteristic of workaholic is their preoccupation with what they have accomplished
[time=2808] now our accomplishments have to be visualized don't they I mean if we do something we have to have some way of letting everybody else know that we've accomplished something
[time=2818] and so in our society the way we make sure that you know that I've made it is by what I possess by what I drive I drive my accomplishments around town
[time=2828] actually I'm driving my monthly payments most of the time but I'd like you to think that they're my accomplishments
[time=2835] Erma Bombay says that our front yard is our statement to the world of who we are I've got a lousy statement pulled out three bushes yesterday and there they lay right in the front yard my statement to the world is I'm a mess
[time=2850] what's your statement to the world that what we're consumed with our accomplishments notice what he says in verse 19 and who knows whether verse 18 rather
[time=2860] I hated my labor which I'd taken over the sun because I should leave it to another man he says I've accomplished all this look at all this and now I'm gonna let go of it
[time=2870] workaholic is so concerned with what he's accumulated what he stored up what he's saving the very thought of parting with him is great anxiety
[time=2878] third characteristic of the workaholic is that they have a demand for control in their lives they've got to be in control my car
[time=2888] you take your car if you want to mess it up you messed up don't mess up my car don't impose on my schedule I've got Monday through Friday charted out
[time=2897] if you need something calls next year we'll have plenty of time this dominant thirst for control and hear Solomon says I've stored up all these things and in frustration he says and now I've got to leave it to somebody else
[time=2910] and in panic he said and he shall have control over it I mean there's not anything worse to a workaholic than somebody else being in control of him or his stuff
[time=2920] fourth characteristic is that the workaholic is characterized by high levels of anxiety
[time=2928] verse 20 therefore I went about the cause my heart to despair he said all my work caused me despair you know what this despair I believe this anxiety is creative
[time=2937] it cycles of frustration and anger I'm frustrated because I'm not living up to my workaholic expectations and I'm angry at you because you have interrupted my quest
[time=2950] high levels of anxiety fifthly the workaholic is characterized by an obsessive drive for perfection very humbly he says this in verse 21
[time=2965] for there is a man he speak himself whose labor is in wisdom and in knowledge and equity the NIV puts that word equity as skill
[time=2975] here's the individual who does his job he does it wisely he does it skillfully he has done it right and he does it that way every time
[time=2984] down to the details he's a perfectionist and finally he is someone who is relentless with his obsession
[time=2999] says this in verse 23 for all his days are sorrow and his travail grief and listen to this in his heart takes not rest in the night this guy can't shut down
[time=3013] I mean when he goes home it's late and when the first thing he does when he gets home as he reviews the day measuring his accomplishments figure out how he can get more productive tomorrow tries to go to sleep with the wheels are still turning
[time=3028] he's obsessed with it all now to be honest with you most of these qualities are good it's not a question of being bad there's not anything wrong with trying to do everything as close to perfect as you can
[time=3042] there's not anything wrong with having a commitment to your work but the problem is its balance it's balance last week we spoke about the dignity and the value of work but it's only part of life
[time=3054] now in these last few moments I want to very quickly give you some very general superficial I think effective solutions think the first thing Solomon says is this relax
[time=3064] you say that's really profound stuff that's what the scripture says look at this verse 24 Solomon says there is nothing better for a man that he should eat and drink and enjoy his labor
[time=3076] now so many times we're working to accumulate more because we think the better is out there I think the bird bear cursor I can't talk today the bear commercials have got some good messages
[time=3087] now if you take out the beer they got some good message there's one that talks about these good old boys they're just out fishing and they catch their fish and they've skinned them they're just ready to fry them up and they look at each other and they say guys it doesn't get any better than this
[time=3103] and you know what they're right there's nothing God offers better in life than for you and I to sit down and to relax and enjoy life the simple things in life eating popcorn and potato chips relax
[time=3119] but most of us are working so hard to accumulate we can't sit down and enjoy the dinner that we feverishly labored under the label I've got to provide for my family you know and we sit down to eat that which we provided we can't even enjoy it he says relax and enjoy life
[time=3137] second thing he says is this it's probably the most effective thing and that is we've got to recognize God's approval the workaholic is a driven man a driven woman
[time=3148] it's the individual who has to find approval every day every day every day every day no matter what they did yesterday they feel guilty today if they don't measure up to the standard they may have worked 16 hours yesterday and if they go home half hour early they feel guilty
[time=3164] I haven't done my part you see the workaholic is this individual who from within is looking for approval and they always project their guilt somewhere else it's that boss it's that supervisor it's those 17 deacons they're driving no it's not it's you
[time=3179] it's me it's inside and here's what Solomon says you don't have to strive for approval he says I've found that in relaxing and enjoying life notice what he says this phrase
[time=3192] this I saw that it was from the hand of God you know what he's saying God approves you don't have to drive yourself crazy to win God's approval he approves of you he accepts you you pass the test relax it's over
[time=3208] finally I think the Bible says we not only have to relax and to recognize God's approval but finally we're going to have to reorganize some of our thinking
[time=3218] either the workaholic is an unbeliever or he or she is a believer who thinks like an unbeliever in the last verse he says God gives to the believer these things wisdom and knowledge and joy
[time=3237] if you're following God and thinking like he wants you to think he's going to give you wisdom and knowledge and joy but if you're a workaholic living like an unbeliever here's what it says that he gives you he gives you travail that's hard work and more of it
[time=3251] then he gives you the desire to accumulate the workaholics got to gather he's got to heap up he's got to have stored up enough is never enough and then finally it says that he may give it over to him that is good
[time=3265] that means when this workaholic stores up what God just takes it and gives it away to his own servants and the workaholics third fear is he's got it and now he's going to lose it
[time=3275] we're going to have to reorganize our thinking and realize that our life's meaning and value does not come through our work it comes through our relationship and our relationship with God
[time=3288] and when we bring our life's thinking our value thinking into God's control we discover that the wisdom and the knowledge and the happiness that we're so desperately searching for God had for us all the time
[time=3305] you know if you're in the caring professions management supervising others are in business that is always wanting more are in the work of a teacher pastor counselor missionary doctor in particular
[time=3323] you're more susceptible to this particularly if you're a mother or housewife there's always one more thing to do the key thing is to surrender control of your life to God
[time=3334] have you made that decision? have you surrendered to him? I pray that you will today if you never have before
