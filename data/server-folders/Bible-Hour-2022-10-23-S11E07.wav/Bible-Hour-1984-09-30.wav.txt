[time=63] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=81] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=85] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=93] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=103] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=106] - Good morning to welcome you to our second worship service.
[time=110] I had the privilege of being in the first worship service and what a joy it was to hear our choir sing a great hymn that's one of my favorites and can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's name.
[time=123] Marilyn Wong, who has been a member of our church for a number of years and moved to Arizona.
[time=128] She and her husband are here today visiting, is going to minister to us in song, and we can sing and praise God together and pray and study His word, and we're delighted that you've come today, and not only want to welcome you friends, but also say a word of welcome to our friends who've allowed us to come into their life through television.
[time=146] We trust that today, God will use this service in each of your lives to give praise and glory to His name and to strengthen your faith that our roots might sink deep, that we might grow strong.
[time=157] Listen now to our choirs, they minister to us with that great hymn and can it be.
[time=162] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=176] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=259] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=448] I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene
[time=459] and wonder how he could love me a sinner condemned, unclean.
[time=464] Continue that theme of the Savior's love by turning to him number 448.
[time=469] We'll sing the first, third and fourth stanzas, and four hundred and forty-h.
[time=475] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=594] - Thank you again for your participation in the music.
[time=604] We appreciate it when you sing.
[time=606] Not only when you sing, but also when you sing with a smile on your face reflecting that spirit that you have inside of you.
[time=613] It's always good to have our special guests be people that have formally sung at our church.
[time=618] Marilyn and Kurt Wong were members of our church for many years, now live in Phoenix, Arizona.
[time=625] Marilyn has continued to sing out there in various churches.
[time=628] We're glad that they're back in Fort Wayne for a week.
[time=631] We invited Marilyn to come and sing for us.
[time=633] She's going to do that today.
[time=635] We appreciate their ministry.
[time=636] We appreciate the ministry of Marilyn this morning as she sings, "How majestic is your name?" (upbeat music)
[time=647] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=780] (upbeat music) - Good morning.
[time=794] Pete, isn't it great to have Marilyn Wong back just a visit for the weekend?
[time=798] It's been so long that she's been here.
[time=800] She lives in Phoenix now and it's delightful to hear her sing again, she's blessed her heart so many times singing in the sounds alive and then ministering in our church and they've been very faithful out there too.
[time=810] She's has sung a lot in the churches in the Phoenix area.
[time=813] - Well it's good to have her home and we'll look forward to hearing her sing again.
[time=817] Today's message is going to be entitled Rooted for Growth because we believe it's absolutely crucial that each of us have our roots sunk deep spiritually into God's work and because of that we offer from time to time a booklet called Timeless Insights, a tool by which you can study God's word daily.
[time=836] Pete has a copy of that and is going to share a little bit about Timeless Insights with you and tell you how you can receive a copy of it.
[time=842] - You know yesterday Rick, my boys and I were playing some football and the boys remark that the leaves were already falling and the Timeless Insights for October certainly shows our falls particularly in the Midwest.
[time=856] Just the other day I was at the restaurant and a lady asked for a daily devotional.
[time=862] Did we have any and I said yes we just happened, I just happened to have one with me and I gave her Timeless Insights.
[time=869] We want to encourage you to write for Timeless Insights today.
[time=872] Beginning October 1st we'll study the New Testament beginning with the book of Matthew.
[time=877] This is a daily Bible study.
[time=878] You can read scripture that is there for you as well as comments and you can receive this by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=893] We encourage you to get your request in for this week because we begin October 1 with this study of the New Testament.
[time=902] - Pete, it's interesting that you had that experience because I had the identical one on Tuesday morning, a couple who are Newtoard Church and I were meeting at a restaurant for breakfast and talking over some things.
[time=912] The Bible was teaching in their lives and they said, can we have something that helps us to study the Bible on a regular basis and I wasn't as prepared as you.
[time=920] I didn't have a copy with me but I mailed them that day a copy of Timeless Insights so that they can begin to grow and to study on their own.
[time=928] We do want you to have a copy.
[time=929] It is free and if you'll write to us today, we'll do our best to you to get it out as quickly as we can.
[time=936] Again, our address is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=943] Coming up this Friday is one of the very, very special events in the life of our church.
[time=950] We have a ministry called Super 60s.
[time=953] It's a ministry to senior citizens between the ages of 55 and 105 and we say that 105 a little bit humorously because if you're over 105 and want to come, you're certainly welcome.
[time=965] But Super 60s is a time of friendship, fellowship, food, study and growth.
[time=971] It's just an exciting time, a fun time and this week is the sixth anniversary on October the fifth and a friend of mine, a man who I appreciate greatly is Senator James Butcher is going to be here to speak.
[time=985] Jim is a senator from Kokomo to the State House and is a godly man who has a testimony that I know will be of encouragement to you and we're looking forward to having a full house somewhere around 650 people we're praying for and anticipating.
[time=999] So on behalf of George and Mary Lantman, I'm inviting you to join us for Super 60s.
[time=1004] If you need help in getting here in the form of transportation, simply call us on Monday through Thursday at 749-8524.
[time=1012] Again, our phone number is 749-8524.
[time=1018] - Now Rick, there'll be a lot of good special music that day two and last Friday I was with Super 60s and just to see them here congregated together and fellowshipping and laughing and singing is, it's a great time and I really encourage the people that are listening to come and fellowship with us next Friday.
[time=1036] - Well the Bible says if two are agreed on a matter, it is so and we agree and we hope that you'll come so that you can agree with us and find that to be a refreshing time.
[time=1045] That's this Friday at 10 o'clock here in the Convocation Center.
[time=1050] Pete, in the way of special music, October and November have some exciting guests coming.
[time=1054] - In October, we're going to have Kathy Sullivan.
[time=1056] Kathy Sullivan is from Los Angeles and since 1976 has sung on the Lawrence Welt program.
[time=1063] So perhaps some of our viewers have seen her.
[time=1066] She's a lovely lady as well as a great testimony, beautiful voice and she'll be here October 21st.
[time=1073] And then looking ahead, we're going to have a Bible Ollie on Saturday, November 3rd and Larnell Harris will be here.
[time=1080] You probably recognize that name associated with the Gaithers, the Gaither Vocal Band and probably another important name, Sandy Patty.
[time=1089] But Larnell Harris will be here, exciting singer.
[time=1093] You'll want to put that date on your calendar and come it's at 730 November 3rd.
[time=1098] - And again, that's right here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1102] And speaking of the church, let's get back to the live part of our morning worship service.
[time=1107] And we're going to hear Marilyn sing again, I believe.
[time=1109] - Marilyn's going to sing again, she's going to sing a great hymn that's familiar to many, The Love of God.
[time=1114] - Well, great, and then I'm looking forward to sharing God's word today with each of you.
[time=1119] We'll look forward to seeing many of you on Friday and encouraging you to plan ahead to be with us for the Bible Ollie on November 3rd with Larnell Harris.
[time=1128] Thank you for joining us today and we trust that God will use this hour to strengthen your faith so that you'll be rooted and build up in Him.
[time=1135] - Just before Marilyn comes to minister to us in song,
[time=1144] today I want to take just a moment to share a word of information with you that many of you may have heard from others who were in the first hour.
[time=1153] George and Mary Lampman, who God has used so many, many times to minister to others at a time of need or a need of our prayers and our love and support.
[time=1164] About two months ago, Mary began to have some medical problems that she kept to herself being a private person and told George about a few weeks after she began to sense something was wrong.
[time=1175] And George is probably more of a private person than any of us and he didn't tell anyone that I know of 'til he told me a week ago that Mary was not feeling well.
[time=1184] Yesterday, Saturday at Parkview Hospital, she went through a routine surgical procedure and it was discovered that she has a sizable tumor in her abdomen that is malignant.
[time=1198] And she was at home today resting, we trust, and we'll go back to the hospital tomorrow to do some more testing to try to determine just how extensive the malignancy is.
[time=1209] We're praying that it is limited and we'll be able to be treated.
[time=1213] If it is limited as we're praying, it will mean some radiation treatment to shrink it and then surgically to remove it.
[time=1221] So we wanted to share that with you because I know all of you know them and love them and would want to know they're at home today and I know they would love to hear from you by cards and notes, but you know, there's a time in life to be alone.
[time=1233] And this is one of those times when I know that they would know that you meant well if you were to call or to visit, but there are times in our lives when we need to be alone and I know that they would love to hear from you through the mail, but really today, they need their time together.
[time=1248] So if you would pray for them and encourage them, they would appreciate that.
[time=1254] Let's now look to the Lord.
[time=1256] Father, as we think of George and Mary, we think of faithfulness, steadfastness and perseverance.
[time=1263] God, they've been faithful to you
[time=1269] and we need to confess God.
[time=1271] We don't know why it is that the young who are stricken down and the faithful who are afflicted and the ones who love you are often the most hurt.
[time=1282] God, your word assures us to know that you have a plan even for the valleys, the fires and the floods of our lives.
[time=1290] Oh God, we would wish we would never see a dark side.
[time=1293] We would want the flood to pass our lives over, but God, that's not been your plan and we need your help today to trust you in those days.
[time=1304] We pray first of all that you would give us that faith that each one needs today to walk through a valley.
[time=1310] God, we pray for George and Mary today that you would encourage their hearts, put hope and confidence in their life.
[time=1317] We thank you for the way that you have raised up Helen Weimer in her battle with cancer and for the great recovery that's come in Judy Dabel's life day by day.
[time=1327] God, for Mary and George, we pray that you would plant that hope and that confidence in you.
[time=1332] We thank you for their fine doctor and the good facilities, but our trust is ultimately in you.
[time=1338] God, we ask you to work in her behalf physically and restore to fullness of health and joy and joy of life.
[time=1346] God, we pray that you would continue to bring about recovery in Judy Dabel's life.
[time=1352] Thank you for the words that she has spoken this week that caused our hearts to be thankful and to rejoice.
[time=1359] God, we pray that you'd continue to strengthen Phil and the family and bring about a full and complete recovery in Judy's life.
[time=1367] Father, today, we pray for the family of Clay's Cox as he is battling cancer in the senior years of his life that you'll strengthen him and help him as he walks through this valley.
[time=1381] We pray for the Sperlin families.
[time=1383] They have a son in Arizona who was in an intense car accident that you administered to him at his point of need.
[time=1391] God, we think of the single parent today, the one who endeavors to do what is a challenge for two people by him or herself.
[time=1399] God, we pray for that one today who has a hurt that discretion or some other need causes them to keep themselves, the God that you would keep them, that you would hear the silent prayer of a hurting heart.
[time=1413] God, we pray that you administer to our every need.
[time=1416] In Jesus' name, we pray.
[time=1418] [AMEN] Roland will come now and sing a song that I know will be one that will bring strength in the time of hurt, one that speaks of the faithfulness of God's love.
[time=1429] Thank you, Marilyn, for your ministry today.
[time=1431] [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=1617] - Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1631] Let's look to the Lord again.
[time=1633] Father, a song would remind us that your love is measureless, that is assured.
[time=1639] God, we've come today to cast the burden of our heart in your lap, and not only our burden, but to cast our very beings to you and ask you to carry us through the storms of life.
[time=1650] Father, as we have assembled today in this place, we've come that we might praise you and sing how majestic is your name.
[time=1657] To reflect on your goodness to us and sing, and can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood.
[time=1665] God, today, to think that your son, Jesus Christ, would so love us that he would die for us.
[time=1670] It's far beyond our fleeting imagination's ability to grasp.
[time=1675] But God, as we would study your word today, we pray that you would build us up in the faith, that we might have a deeper understanding of who you are and your love for us.
[time=1683] We pray that our lives might be invigorated, that we would grow strong in our commitment to you, that we would be different as a result of having been this place today.
[time=1693] Oh, God, speak to our hearts.
[time=1695] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1700] We're studying through the book of Second Peter, and last week we talked about God's plan for growth.
[time=1706] And today we're going to talk about being rooted for growth.
[time=1709] We're studying from Second Peter the first chapter.
[time=1712] About two months ago, Kathy and I had the privilege of moving to a new house.
[time=1717] The house was new to us.
[time=1718] Actually, it's about 20 years old, and it's a house we've already come to love and to enjoy, and we're so thankful for.
[time=1725] But when you buy a 20-year-old house, you buy some 20-year-old problems along with it, one of which were a good number of bushes that were 20 years old and had grown rather large, blocking the front of the house, looking something, shall we say, less than attractive.
[time=1742] So I set out with determination that I was going to remove those bushes.
[time=1746] So I went to one rather large bush and struck my shovel down to the ground near where the roots would be.
[time=1752] And just to see how tough a job was gonna be, I grabbed it around the trunk and I pulled it out.
[time=1758] Oh, this is going to be easy.
[time=1761] Big strong guy like myself.
[time=1762] I mean, I did that the three or four, but I just put the shovel in, loosened and pulled in my, oh, it was great.
[time=1769] Easy job.
[time=1770] We came to two other bushes.
[time=1773] Put the shovel to the ground and dug and dug and fought and pulled and those things, they weren't budging.
[time=1778] So we had this chain, I mean, this was a man-sized chain.
[time=1783] It was about that big around the links were, and we wrapped it around that chain and got a friend's little pickup truck that has one of those low gears.
[time=1792] And we said, "Bush, we got you." Put that on and we tugged and we jerked on that bush and we jerked, we jerked the truck.
[time=1801] And you just see this little truck almost bouncing, that bush hardly budged.
[time=1805] A few days later, I was getting a load of dirt with a dump truck, not a little pickup truck with a dumping bed, I mean a dump truck.
[time=1814] The kind your kids see when you're driving down the street and they go, "Truck, it's a big one." And I said to the driver, "Can I pay you a few dollars to hook my chain on the back of your truck and get this bush out of here?" With almost a proud sense of glue, he said, "We'll jerk that thing out there for ya." So he backed up his dump truck, shifted that down into low gear, hooked on the chairing and watched his dump truck come to a screeching halt.
[time=1838] (audience laughing) This bush stopped a full size dump truck and it sat there and spun its tires.
[time=1850] This poor delightful man who was helping God out and scratched his head and went home a defeated soul.
[time=1856] You see, why is it that this bush, a little guy can pull out with one hand and this one stops a dump truck?
[time=1864] Well, there were two differences.
[time=1866] The first bush was planted in some loose sandy soil.
[time=1870] Not only was it loose soil, but it hadn't grown much in the way of roots.
[time=1875] It was shallow and small.
[time=1877] The other bush was in some pretty solid ground and its roots were many and deep and strong.
[time=1886] No people are a lot like bushes.
[time=1890] Some of you've got a lot of root to life.
[time=1892] You've got some depth and your roots are many and they're strong.
[time=1898] And others of us, our roots are pretty shallow, pretty weak.
[time=1903] Oh, there's a lot up front to be seen.
[time=1906] There's not much under the level of topsoil.
[time=1909] We need to be like that bush planted in solid ground and rooted deep because life comes along that wraps a chain around us.
[time=1920] Then some other event comes like a truck and grabs a hole that chain begins to jerk on our lives.
[time=1926] That's our root that's gonna make the difference.
[time=1931] It's not how much that's above the ground that makes the tree strong.
[time=1935] It's what's below the ground.
[time=1938] That gives stability and strength in life and in faith.
[time=1944] Peter writes about growing deep and growing strong.
[time=1951] Paul said to the Church of Colossae, as you have therefore received Christ as Savior, so walking in Him rooted and built up, established in the faith, rooted first, then built up.
[time=1967] Peter writes to a group of people about being rooted, said their faith may grow.
[time=1972] Second Peter, chapter one, verse 12.
[time=1980] "Therefore, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them and be established in the present truth.
[time=1993] Yea, I think at me, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance." Knowing that shortly I must put off my tabernacle, even as the Lord Jesus Christ has shown me.
[time=2008] Moreover, I will endeavor that you may be able, after my deceased, to have these things always in remembrance.
[time=2016] For you have not followed cunningly devised fables
[time=2022] when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, but were I witnesses of His majesty.
[time=2030] For he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
[time=2044] And this voice which came from heaven we heard.
[time=2049] And when we were with him in the holy mount, we have also a more sure word of prophecy,
[time=2058] wherein to you do well to take heed, as unto a light that's shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart.
[time=2069] Knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretation, for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[time=2086] In the second half of the first chapter of Second Peter, he speaks about sinking deep and growing tall and the need to be rooted.
[time=2097] In the first four verses 12 through 15, he talks about the need for sinking our roots deep.
[time=2105] In verses 16 through 21, he talks about the authority of God's word into which were to sink.
[time=2111] Today we're going to look primarily at those first four verses that we've read.
[time=2118] As Peter writes, he's writing to them saying, sink your roots deep and he's got two reasons why he wants them to sink their roots deep.
[time=2127] The first reason is this.
[time=2128] Peter was writing in anticipation of false teachers.
[time=2133] He said, sink your roots deep because they're false teachers that are gonna come among you.
[time=2139] Now how do I arrive at that?
[time=2142] Well two things, look at verse 16, and you'll see that he tells them that the gospel that he has preached is not a cunningly devised fable.
[time=2151] There were those who were going around saying, oh this gospel, Peter's is just a fable.
[time=2155] And then jumping ahead, we really find the purpose of his letter in chapter two, verse one he says, but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who shall privately bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them.
[time=2176] You see Peter's occasion for writing this epistle was to say, sink your roots deep because they're gonna become false teachers who are gonna creep into this congregation and he's gonna wrap a chain about you, a false doctrine, and he's gonna begin to pull you slowly and methodically away from the gospel of Christ that you've received.
[time=2195] So he's saying, sink your roots deep because I'm anticipating the rise of false teachers.
[time=2202] All these false teachers can be divided into at least two groups.
[time=2206] The first group are a group of people who are deniers.
[time=2210] Chapter two, verse one says, who denied the Lord that bought them?
[time=2215] They outright deny that Jesus Christ is God's son that he is the Savior, that he is indeed the Lord.
[time=2221] Verse 16 of chapter one speaks about
[time=2227] cunningly devised fables.
[time=2230] There were those who were deniers who when Peter or Paul or Barnabas or Silas would go into an area, will lead people to Christ, establish a church, and then move on, they would follow in after the apostles had left.
[time=2244] And they would say, oh, that's interesting.
[time=2247] And we want you to know that we believe in Jesus also.
[time=2252] But Jesus was just a man.
[time=2257] This business about raising the dead or walking on the water of all things is simply a myth.
[time=2264] It's all a fable, cunningly devised.
[time=2269] Oh, those were a bunch of sharpies that were, now we believe in Jesus, but the Jesus we believe in was just a good human being, and we should concentrate on his teachings, of course, but not become involved in believing that he was some type of God.
[time=2288] Sure, Jesus was the Son of God, just as you and I are all the sons and daughters of God.
[time=2294] They were deniers.
[time=2297] They said it was all just a fable.
[time=2300] Yes, there was a historic Jesus, but no, he didn't walk on the water.
[time=2305] You know, it's kind of like Paul Bunyan.
[time=2306] Well, there probably was a man by the name of Paul Bunyan.
[time=2309] And I believe that, but you really don't believe he had a blue ox named babe now, do you?
[time=2316] I mean, I believe in Jesus, sure, but come on.
[time=2321] Walking on the water, just a myth, it's just a myth.
[time=2326] You see, in the times that Peter was writing, he said just as there were false prophets, Old Testament times, so there will be false teachers among you who denied the Lord.
[time=2339] And so he identifies for them very, very quickly that there are going to be deniers.
[time=2345] There's a second group of false teachers that became very prominent too.
[time=2349] These were not deniers, these were deceivers.
[time=2353] These people came in and they did not deny the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=2358] They said all of the right things, but what they did was they deceived others by saying, "All that Paul said, great stuff." Peter, right on, Bible, good stuff, but did you know that there's more than this book, that this is only part of God's revelation, and we have a new revelation from God, and it's fantastic.
[time=2384] And we are commissioned by him to come and to share it with you.
[time=2390] And these people began to deceive, not deny, but deceive by saying all of the right things at first, and then taking and adding to what they were affirming a whole new deception.
[time=2405] And gradually, when you're around this type of false teacher, they at first maximize the gospel and minimize their differences, but the longer you're with them, the more they minimize the gospel and maximize the differences because they've got you and they've hooked you.
[time=2422] Now let's be honest, men and women.
[time=2426] If Peter said there were false prophets,
[time=2433] years ago, and he said there will be false teachers in the early church.
[time=2440] Let's be honest, wouldn't there be false teachers in every age, including ours?
[time=2444] And it always comes back to these two things,
[time=2450] deniers and deceivers.
[time=2453] Do you know that across this country, this is a land that is dotted by steeples,
[time=2463] and those steeples cover hundreds of peoples, thousands of people, all looking at a pulpit where a man would stand, and many of them are meeting in the name of Christ, and the very purpose of their meeting is to deny his deity.
[time=2483] There are those that speak about de-mythologizing the scriptures.
[time=2491] They mean that the Bible is just kind of like Roman mythology, Greek literature, and what we need to do is extract out of it the myths and discard them so that we can get down to the real truth.
[time=2506] And so they say sure, sure, there's no doubt about it.
[time=2509] There was a Noah and a flood, but what you need to understand is that Noah was simply caught in a big boat in a localized flood, and to Noah, that seemed like the whole world.
[time=2521] And so he wrote down that the whole world was flooded.
[time=2524] Oh, no doubt that Moses was a real person, but he didn't call down 10 plagues upon Egypt, but it just was coincidental that the times of Moses were times of unnatural calamities that struck Egypt at that time, just like tornadoes and twisters have hit the great plains of America recently.
[time=2544] See, they call that de-mythologizing, and I can't even say anymore, they're taking the myths out of scripture.
[time=2551] They're denying it, they're saying, oh yeah, we've got it here, but don't believe it.
[time=2557] You know, there's probably as many places where that's being taught today as there are places that saying this is God's word, and he said, watch out for the deniers.
[time=2565] There are also deceivers.
[time=2569] There are those who are naming the name of Christ, and if you ask them, do you believe Jesus Christ as the Son of God, they'd say, yes, we do, but they really believe a different gospel.
[time=2579] One man was a deceiver.
[time=2583] He came down to a small village in upstate New York
[time=2589] and said, you're not gonna believe this.
[time=2591] An angel appeared unto me and told me where I could find these 12 golden tablets.
[time=2596] The people that tell him basically said, you're right, we don't believe you.
[time=2599] And he was asked to produce the 12 golden tablets so that they might believe, and he quickly explained that if he had the tablets, they couldn't read them anyway.
[time=2610] Why came the inquiry?
[time=2613] Well, because you have to have the magic, heavenly spectacles in order to be able to interpret the stones, okay, bring the tablets and the spectacles.
[time=2625] Well, they've ascended to heaven, and a group of witnesses were then conjured up to say that they saw the tablets, but all of them claimed something different.
[time=2638] And the people of that community said, you're nothing but a hoax.
[time=2641] You're nothing but a systematic fableizer, and they drove them out of upstate New York.
[time=2648] So they came to a city of Nauvoo, Illinois and went through the same thing.
[time=2652] The people said, you guys aren't telling the truth, and they drove them out.
[time=2658] And they went to Missouri, and they drove them out, and they finally ended in Salt Lake, Utah, where nobody else wanted to be, and they claimed it as their own.
[time=2666] You see, that's not very gracious to talk about Mormons like that.
[time=2672] I wanna be honest with you, men and women, they're deceivers.
[time=2675] They do not believe the gospel that we believe.
[time=2678] They believe a different gospel, and I'm telling you today, because they're gonna knock on your door.
[time=2683] Or someone claiming to be a witness of Jehovah is going to knock on your door, and they're going to be, again, to systematically wrap a strong chain about you, and they're gonna try to disroot you from God's word.
[time=2698] I have to be honest.
[time=2700] I rather enjoy getting one of those knocks on my door when I have a free moment and they arrive, because I'm quick to not tell them what I do as an occupation.
[time=2711] And I discovered a number of things.
[time=2714] First of all, they're gonna say everything that you and I believe.
[time=2717] You talk to them about what you believe, you know what they're gonna say, yes.
[time=2720] Those people will knock on your door.
[time=2722] They're gonna say yes, and they're gonna agree to everything you say, so that for the first 15 minutes, your head's always bobbing, yes, yes.
[time=2728] And then they're gonna start saying what they believe, and your head's still bobbing.
[time=2732] And they'll usually say, well, you know, it's been discovered.
[time=2737] Good question is by who.
[time=2740] Are we learned to interpret it?
[time=2741] This verse really means, well, who interpreted that?
[time=2745] It says right here in verse 20, knowing this that no prophecy of scriptures of any private interpretation, who?
[time=2751] And then the zinger comes.
[time=2754] Well, the Greek New Testament says, that's when I smile.
[time=2758] Can you read Greek?
[time=2759] Well, no, no, no.
[time=2762] I can.
[time=2763] Now, I don't tell them I struggle with this stuff.
[time=2765] I just tell them I can.
[time=2766] You know, it's interesting.
[time=2770] Everything begins to change.
[time=2773] As soon as I say, no, that doesn't mean that.
[time=2777] They wanna leave.
[time=2780] They wanna go.
[time=2781] It's over with.
[time=2782] Because if it's not going the way of the deceiver, the deceiver gets out of the way.
[time=2788] And what they're doing is they're going door to door.
[time=2792] House to house, city to city, and they're knocking on doors, looking for those whose roots are not deep.
[time=2798] And they're wrapping a chain around them, and they're pulling them out.
[time=2804] Sink your roots deep.
[time=2810] About a month ago, I was invited to a breakfast.
[time=2816] They were buying.
[time=2818] Always be suspicious when someone else is buying breakfast.
[time=2821] I again went more out of curiosity,
[time=2827] but it was the Unification Church, who was more commonly known as the Moonies.
[time=2832] And they invited all the available clergy in Fort Wayne to come and to meet.
[time=2837] And about 20 showed up.
[time=2840] And their whole point of meeting was to assure us that they were just as Christian as we are.
[time=2848] And they opened up their Bibles and they gave one of the best explanations of creation I've ever heard.
[time=2854] When you talk about defending creation is, and they're right on.
[time=2857] And then they talked about the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2863] the Son of God.
[time=2864] That's what we believe, right?
[time=2867] They're just like us, right?
[time=2868] They're not just like us.
[time=2871] There were some sharp people there.
[time=2875] I was amazed.
[time=2877] Some of the people who I thought weren't as committed to God's word as we might think.
[time=2883] And they zapped them.
[time=2885] Let me ask you this.
[time=2886] Do you believe anything else is on an equal authority with the Bible?
[time=2890] Well, no, the Bible, that's it.
[time=2892] Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[time=2893] You mean you don't believe that suddenly young moons teaching you equal to the Bible?
[time=2897] Oh, yes, they are.
[time=2899] Oh, they are.
[time=2900] Oh, interesting.
[time=2903] And then they went on to explain that Jesus came, but Jesus didn't accomplish all that he was supposed to accomplish.
[time=2910] And so he was going to come back again.
[time=2912] He was the Lord of the first Advent.
[time=2914] Now God's gonna send the Lord of the second Advent.
[time=2917] Question, is Son a young moon the Lord of the second Advent?
[time=2924] Yes, he is.
[time=2926] That's not the gospel.
[time=2928] Jesus Christ said, I will come again.
[time=2931] And he said, I will come in the same manner in which you have seen me go.
[time=2934] That means he went up and ascended into the clouds and he's gonna come down descending out of the clouds.
[time=2940] So says Zachariah in 1 Thessalonians at 1 Corinthians.
[time=2944] You see, it's a deception.
[time=2946] They take what we believe and they take it and they get our heads bobbing, yes.
[time=2951] And then they turn it.
[time=2954] Sink your roots deep so you can grow strong.
[time=2957] Peter says, sink your roots deep because he anticipated
[time=2963] the rise of false teachers among them.
[time=2966] The Bible says there was, and there always will be false teachers among you.
[time=2973] Let me just share something with you.
[time=2975] It is a very, very dangerous thing for any of us to learn only from one source.
[time=2985] Someone said, I don't know if I like all the people of my church listening to all these preachers on the radio, because every once in a while they say something I don't agree with.
[time=2996] But I'm glad you listened to good preaching on the radio because Hawks doesn't have a corner on the truth.
[time=3002] I don't have a corner on the truth.
[time=3005] And it would be very easy for someone to become
[time=3011] too familiar with only one teacher, and that's where Colts come from, you know.
[time=3016] You see, Jim Jones will box out his audience
[time=3022] from listening to anyone else, lest they discover that he's in air.
[time=3027] That's why people who are followers of many of these faith healing Colts are instructed not to go anywhere else, not to listen to anyone else, only listen to me.
[time=3042] Because they're deceivers, tragically self-deceived, but then secondly, deceivers of others.
[time=3048] Sink your roots deep.
[time=3051] Peter wrote to them, telling them to be rooted because of false teachers.
[time=3056] But he also had a second reason for telling them to be rooted because he not only anticipated the rise of false teachers, but he anticipated his own death.
[time=3064] Versus 14 and 15 strongly say this,
[time=3070] knowing this that I shortly must put off this my tabernacle, even as the Lord has shown me.
[time=3076] Moreover, I endeavor that you may be able, after my deceased, to have these things always in remembrance.
[time=3083] Apparently through some avenue, whether it was God revealed it to him, or whether it was the spirit of God giving him the intuitive knowledge, but Peter knew this was about the end.
[time=3094] It may have something to do with being imprisoned.
[time=3097] But he said, I know I'm about to die.
[time=3099] And because he anticipated his death, he was saying to them, I'm not going to be here.
[time=3105] You can't run to me and say, Peter, are these the good guys or are these the bad guys?
[time=3109] You can't run to me and Peter say, what does this verse mean?
[time=3111] You can't say, well, we'll run and dump this one on Peter.
[time=3115] Peter says, I'm not gonna be here.
[time=3117] Sink your roots deep, so that when I'm gone, you can stand on your own.
[time=3121] It's interesting how he describes his coming death.
[time=3127] In two places, he describes his body as his tabernacle.
[time=3131] That means tent.
[time=3133] A tent's what you put up to live in when you're not gonna stay there too long.
[time=3137] I mean, nobody digs a foundation and puts a lot of money into a house if they're only gonna be there a day or two.
[time=3145] You throw up a tent.
[time=3147] And the children of Israel, as they were wandering from prison and slavery in Egypt to the promised land, they never built temples.
[time=3154] They always put up a tabernacle, a portable tent, something they weren't gonna stay in too long.
[time=3160] Then in verse 15, he says, and after my disease, it's actually the word departure.
[time=3167] Compound of two Greek words.
[time=3169] X, which means out of, exit.
[time=3172] O-dose, which means the way.
[time=3174] And they squeeze them together, come up with a compound that says, X-o-dose in English, Exodus.
[time=3180] Here's what he was saying, I'm just living in this tent.
[time=3183] My human body is just a tent and I'm looking forward to my exodus into the promised land.
[time=3190] What a tremendous, tremendous parallel of how we should perceive life.
[time=3195] That we're just temporary living in these tents and we're looking forward to the exodus into the promised land of God.
[time=3202] Just as the children of Israel exited Egypt to enter into the promised land, death is our avenue of exiting this life into God's promised land.
[time=3211] Peter says, sink your roots deep so that you can grow strong because I'm not gonna be here.
[time=3217] Now, what was his plan for them sinking the roots deep?
[time=3221] One word occurs three times.
[time=3223] It says this, verse 12, I'm gonna be careful to put you always in remembrance, always in remembrance.
[time=3233] Then a few verses later, verse 13, I'm going to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.
[time=3240] Verse 15, that you have these things always in remembrance.
[time=3245] You know what Peter's plan was?
[time=3246] He said, false teachers are right around the corner, my deaths around the next corner.
[time=3250] So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna give you this new deep insight that no one's ever heard of before.
[time=3256] That's not what he said.
[time=3258] He said, since the going's gonna be tough, let's get back to the basics.
[time=3262] I wanna put you in remembrance.
[time=3265] These were things I already knew.
[time=3266] Look at verse 12, I'm gonna put you in remembrance of these things though you know them, though you know them and are established in the present truth, meaning what you presently know you're established in it, but I'm gonna remind you again and again and again.
[time=3282] Now, if you've ever been in education, you know that repetition is one of the keys to successful teaching, repeat it, repeat it, and repeat it.
[time=3293] And Peter said, that's what I'm gonna do.
[time=3294] I'm gonna repeat to you again and again the basic things.
[time=3297] William Barkley, the fine New Testament scholar, said that it's often the job of the teacher and the preacher, not to teach the people new truth, but to remind them of things they already know.
[time=3307] You know that's true in a number of areas of life.
[time=3311] About a month ago, Kathy and I went with another couple, some friends of ours up to the angle area to go golfing for the day.
[time=3318] We had a good plan.
[time=3319] I thought we'd play nine holes with the gals, let them go cook lunch while we'd play nine more holes.
[time=3323] That sounded fair, Kathy didn't like the plan, but it sounded good.
[time=3327] And as we took off on those last nine holes, we were gonna tear the course apart, you know, we were good and loose.
[time=3332] I bet on this hole that it took us seven or eight shots each to get to the green.
[time=3336] It was a disaster.
[time=3337] Because in golf, there's a tremendous desire to wanna swing the ball and to look.
[time=3343] And you gotta keep your head down.
[time=3345] And we were doing so bad after we played the first hole, we looked and nobody was on it.
[time=3349] We ran back and said, we'll start over.
[time=3351] But we started over doing the exact same thing.
[time=3354] We couldn't keep our heads down.
[time=3356] After about four holes, he looked at me and said, Hawks, you would think that grown men could keep their heads down.
[time=3362] I mean, it's that basic of a problem.
[time=3364] So I had to be mean.
[time=3366] I called his secretary a week later and said, give Dave a message.
[time=3369] Tell him to keep his head down.
[time=3371] I saw him at church the next day.
[time=3372] He was walking around like this.
[time=3374] But you know, it's basic, isn't it?
[time=3375] It's the little things that you always do wrong.
[time=3378] That's why he's saying, keep your head down in the language of the golfer.
[time=3384] Go over the basics again and again and again.
[time=3387] Let me give you the two basics.
[time=3390] The first basic that Peter's gonna drive home in this book is who Jesus Christ is, that he is the son of God, lived eternally in heaven, came into human form at Bethlehem, born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, and in him alone is salvation.
[time=3407] That's the basic.
[time=3408] And the second basic we're gonna talk about next week is this book is God's word, and there is no other book that is God's word, and this book is the authority on which we believe and live, and nobody has a corner on the market when it comes to teaching it.
[time=3424] The basics, the son of God and the word of God,
[time=3430] know them, be thoroughly acquainted with each of them.
[time=3434] You've got to sink your roots deep so you can grow strong.
[time=3438] How's your root system?
[time=3442] Oh, we got a lot showing on top.
[time=3444] But are the roots going deep?
[time=3446] As you've therefore received Christ as Savior, so walk ye in him, being rooted and build up, established in the faith.
[time=3455] God, our Father, we're thankful in faith.
[time=3458] (gentle music) - We've had a wonderful time worshiping the Lord together,
[time=3468] and you've been listening to our pastor, Rick Hawk, speak from the word of God.
[time=3472] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now.
[time=3481] Will you pray with me?
[time=3482] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, and I thank you that you sent your son to die on the cross for me.
[time=3492] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sin and to cleanse me.
[time=3498] I ask you Jesus to come in today.
[time=3501] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3503] Please write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
