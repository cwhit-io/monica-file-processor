[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=60] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=74] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=80] it's the Bible Hour.
[time=82] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word, with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=91] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=95] Then sing by song, by sea, good morning, I pray God, I pray God, I pray God.
[time=121] I pray God, I pray God, I pray God, I pray God, I pray God, I pray God, I pray God,
[time=280] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=315] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=326] What a joy it is this morning to come
[time=332] and to sing that familiar praise to our Lord together.
[time=335] We want to welcome you this morning to our second worship service and also say a word of welcome to our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=343] Each morning we meet and we sing how great thou art, but today to sing along with our choir, to take that familiar hymn and to sing it in a unfamiliar way grabs our attention.
[time=355] I think it was John Kennedy who said that when we do the common things of life in the uncommon way that we will grab the attention of the world.
[time=363] I hope that today a familiar song grabbed your attention and drove your praise to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=370] There's a few pauses in there that most of us weren't prepared for.
[time=374] I started to sing then sings my soul, and I sang then four times before I was in place, but I'm usually out of step, but we can praise God together in our song.
[time=384] Music has always been a part of our church because it's perhaps the greatest way we have of expressing our love, our excitement, and our praise to the Lord.
[time=392] Last night here in the Convocation Center we had a concert with Larnell Harris, and he is back with us today.
[time=398] Music that brings praise to the Lord, encourages and excites the heart.
[time=402] Larnell, we're so thankful for your ministry and that you're with us this morning. Welcome.
[time=406] Good morning.
[time=416] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=528] [APPLAUSE]
[time=538] Good morning to you, and I bring you greetings from Danville, Kentucky.
[time=542] Anybody ever heard of Danville?
[time=544] You know, everybody speak up at once. It's really good.
[time=550] Well, that's why I'm from Danville.
[time=552] I now live in Louisville, and Mark Payne on the piano from Baltimore, Maryland.
[time=556] And so we're just really pleased and privileged to be with you this morning to worship together.
[time=562] And how excellent is thy name?
[time=564] We all come together. I know the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=566] And there's a song that I used to sing when I was a we-lad and a boy soprano.
[time=572] And many people think I'm still a boy soprano.
[time=574] [MUSIC]
[time=584] This is the idea of what we come to this present.
[time=588] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=744] Pete, it sure has been a tremendous weekend with Larnell Harris here.
[time=749] He has the ability to sing with the power of no one I've ever known, and certainly has the variety of music too.
[time=756] I don't think there was a person in our audience last night that really was upset with the music because he just is capable of going from, seems like, one pole to the other and just did a marvelous job.
[time=766] Well, we had three generations of the Hawks family here yesterday, and our four-year-old said, "Can we do that again?" And I said, "Well, not necessarily this weekend, but we'll have them in church tomorrow." And she was excited, and my parents were here, and I'm not going to tell you how old they are, but they're older than I am, and they enjoyed it too.
[time=785] Well, we're glad that he was able to stay over and minister in our church service and also for the Bible hour, because this program was made possible by the Bible hour ministry, and we're grateful for Dale Siegel in his direction of the Bible hour, and also the people that are faithful in the Founders Club and others that give faithfully.
[time=804] This was another avenue where we could minister through the Bible hour.
[time=809] Pete, that is so true.
[time=810] I feel like there's a tremendous inequity in the ministry.
[time=814] You and I, because we're on this end of the cameras, are out in the grocery stores or in the malls or around town, and we meet people who tell us, "Thank you for the Bible hours," though we did everything that needed to be done, just the two of us.
[time=827] And the truth of the matter is that there are people who are operating cameras and lights and sound and engineering who do so much.
[time=835] We think of Dale Siegel in who is many ways the idea man of the Bible and I think Glenn and Debbie Schick are going to bring cots to sleep on there here so often.
[time=844] Every time I come in the building, it seems like they're here.
[time=846] And they beat us here quite often.
[time=848] They do that all as a volunteer ministry, and we really appreciate all those people, and we appreciate you because of your financial support and your prayer support.
[time=857] You're the ones that make this ministry possible by helping to finance it, and this weekend was sort of a celebration of praise, a thank you, a time of enjoyment and encouragement for all of us.
[time=868] It gives us an opportunity, too, to see some of the people because they do come for these Bible hour rallies, and it just seems like in the last week I've met an awful lot of people who mentioned that they watched the Bible hour regularly, and we are really encouraged when we meet people as well as people that write in and tell us what the Bible hour means to them.
[time=886] I think it's difficult sometimes because we don't hear.
[time=889] When we do hear, it's a real great encouragement to us.
[time=892] Oh, it is, and I brought a letter with me this morning just to share with you friends how encouraging it gets.
[time=899] This young lady writes, and I'm assuming she's a young lady because she refers to her grandmother.
[time=904] I've never met her, but she says today was a very special day.
[time=908] I asked God to come into my life and to be my shepherd of life.
[time=913] I watched the Bible hour September the 9th.
[time=916] This is the program my grandmother had told me about.
[time=919] I will thank her today for sharing this with me and making me want to get involved.
[time=925] What a joy that is to us, and I trust to you to hear that through this particular ministry, and it's not important that it was this ministry, but that a young lady came to Christ.
[time=935] But it is an encouragement to us to know that God is using the Bible hour and our church in ways of reaching men and women for Christ, and you're part of that by your prayers and your financial support, and we wanted to share the good news with you.
[time=948] And I bet many of you have news like that that you could share.
[time=952] Perhaps you've received Christ, and we'd love to know that.
[time=955] Perhaps you've been discouraged in something you heard by way of music or a message on the Bible hour has picked you up.
[time=962] Something as happened that has made the difference in your life spiritually.
[time=965] We'd love to hear from you.
[time=967] And if you had right to us, we would just count that a real special encouragement.
[time=971] Pete, would you just tell them how they can go about writing in?
[time=974] I would encourage you to write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=983] That's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=990] And Pete, while they're writing to encourage us, we want to encourage them by sending them a pamphlet by Clyde Narrowmore entitled "Your Ministry of Encouragement." You may not be able to sing Larnell or preach like some of the men you hear on the radio or television or in your church, but you can still have a tremendous influence by being an encourager.
[time=1009] And this pamphlet will give you some practical ideas and biblical insights how you can do that.
[time=1015] Again, the address is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1023] Write to us, encourage us with what's been happening in your life spiritually, and we'll send this pamphlet to you to be an encouragement.
[time=1031] Pete, before we go back, it's living Christmas tree time, isn't it?
[time=1035] I was a bit surprised yesterday when I picked up the paper and saw the ad for living Christmas tree tickets even though I put it in there.
[time=1041] We'd like to remind our viewers that this is an opportunity for you to come again to the Blackhawk Baptist Church where we'll put on our eighth annual living Christmas tree.
[time=1050] There are a number of tickets that are dispersed throughout the community, and where we're reminding you that the public can receive free tickets on November 17th at 9 a.m.
[time=1059] If you'll come to the Blackhawk Baptist Church and the Convocation Center there, you can receive the tickets.
[time=1066] We'll begin dispersing the tickets at 9 o'clock, and probably some 20,000 tickets will be available, so this is an excellent time for our viewers to come and receive their tickets.
[time=1076] Pete, I know people ask if they can write or call in, and if that was possible, we would do it, but it just is not possible for us to mail out tickets to the general public.
[time=1086] So if you'll come, we'll give them to you on November 17th at 9 o'clock.
[time=1091] Unfortunately, we can't handle all the telephone calls because it's a logistical problem, but if they'll mark that date on their calendar, we can assure them that they'll receive tickets for the performances.
[time=1102] And now it's time to go back to the Morning Worship Service.
[time=1105] Arnell's been with us all weekend.
[time=1107] He'll conclude his ministry with us by singing a couple other numbers, and he's just done a fine job, and we appreciate the ministry of music through Arnell.
[time=1114] We sure do, and we're going to go back to him right now.
[time=1144] We're going to go back to the Sky,
[time=1150] and all who see her.
[time=1157] We know she stands for liberty for you,
[time=1166] and for me.
[time=1169] And now I'm so proud to be called and American,
[time=1181] to be named with brave and free.
[time=1193] And I'm an honor of a flag, and now I trust in God.
[time=1203] And now I'll stand to liberty.
[time=1217] And all who make our path less still across,
[time=1226] across with our Lord arranged to the sky.
[time=1237] And all who kneel there,
[time=1244] they live forever, as all the saints can testify.
[time=1256] And I'm so proud.
[time=1260] I'm so proud to be called a Christian,
[time=1267] to be named with the ransom and the horn.
[time=1280] And as that statue liberates the citizens,
[time=1289] so that cross liberates my soul.
[time=1301] And all who cross is my statue of liberty for you.
[time=1314] And it was there that my soul, it was there that my soul was set free.
[time=1325] And I'm gonna save the eye, proclaim that a rugged cross is my statue of liberty.
[time=1343] And I'll save the eye,
[time=1352] proclaim that a rugged cross is my statue of liberty.
[time=1368] And I'll save the eye,
[time=1378] proclaim that a rugged cross is my statue of liberty.
[time=1397] I don't know of a better song that we could hear this morning, that a song that reminds us of the liberty that we possess in this nation as we approach election day,
[time=1407] and the liberty that we possess as Christians in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1412] During the late summer and early fall, we, as a church, sponsored two times where you could come to an evening worship service,
[time=1422] neither before or after that service, you could register to vote.
[time=1426] We did that so that we could make it as convenient for you as possible, because we believe that it is a responsibility and a privilege both that we have in this country
[time=1436] participating in the selection of our government and of those who would lead us as a nation.
[time=1443] It was Abraham Lincoln who said in his famous Gettysburg Address that we are a government of the people,
[time=1450] by the people, and for the people. And that brings us a point of great, great privilege.
[time=1457] But the scripture says to whom much is given in the way of privileges, much is required in the way of responsibility. All that we have is much.
[time=1467] There has never been a land in history that has possessed more freedom or more prosperity than do we.
[time=1473] That is a tremendous privilege, but with it comes the responsibility of participating within our government.
[time=1479] And I want to encourage you to make sure that you vote this Tuesday.
[time=1484] If you have to get up early, get up early. If you have to skip lunch, skip lunch.
[time=1489] Do what you need to do to make sure that you vote.
[time=1492] Because of the debates both nationally and this week locally, we've had ample opportunity to be informed of the candidates of their positions.
[time=1501] There are not only government officials being elected, there are being judges who are being retained, there are issues on the ballot. I want to encourage you to do everything you can to make sure that you're informed as you go to the poll on Tuesday and then Tuesday to vote.
[time=1515] It is a tremendous privilege that God has given to us in this land.
[time=1519] And the only way that we can keep it is to guard it by our participation and our support.
[time=1524] And so even this morning, let us look to the Lord in prayer on behalf of our nation.
[time=1529] Our God and our Father, today we bow before you and realize that it is only you who causes one nation to rise in another to fall.
[time=1538] And so Father, we do not stand here to praise the history, but we praise the God who stands behind history.
[time=1546] Your word has warned us that righteousness, exultination, and sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=1552] Oh God, today we pray that you would bring about within this election process, the election of people who would promote righteousness, the election of people who would restrain sin.
[time=1563] God, we pray that you would move not only in the hearts of our people as it comes time to cast a ballot, but you would move within our hearts to bring about spiritual and moral revival.
[time=1576] God, we realize the leaders only lead in the direction that the people encourage them to go.
[time=1582] So God put within the hearts of the people of this land, a desire for you and to please you.
[time=1588] We pray that there would be a humble spirit so that you would not need to humbles.
[time=1593] We pray that there would be a grateful heart so that you would not have to take away for us to learn what we possess.
[time=1600] God, we pray that there would be a sensitive heart so that you do not have to chastise us before that we would hear your voice.
[time=1608] God, we pray for this country, this community, that there would be a God honoring spirit in our hearts, that there would be the constant draw of men and women to Christ.
[time=1619] We pray that this church would continue to penetrate this community with the gospel of Christ,
[time=1625] that men and women would be one and discipled and nurtured in the Lord.
[time=1629] We pray that you would make this church a city of refuge for those whose lives are broken,
[time=1635] that they would find that even in the hurts and the disappointments and the failures that God cares for them.
[time=1641] God made that discouraged heart today, discovered that in Jesus Christ, there's a path of rebuilding and a power and a hope.
[time=1648] God, we pray that you administer and encourage the hearts of those who are broken today.
[time=1653] We think of the Sperlin family and the death of their son John.
[time=1657] Oh, God, today, give to them comfort and peace in this midst of a storm.
[time=1662] God, we pray that you would renew the hearts of those who have lost loved ones.
[time=1666] It may have been months or years, but the whole lingers.
[time=1669] God, we pray that you would fill their life.
[time=1672] Now, Father, as we open your ward, we pray that you would speak to our heart, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1681] You've wondered, haven't you? And so have I.
[time=1685] We've both wondered how someone could profess Christ and give what appeared to be a fascinating and fantastic testimony,
[time=1694] only to discover that their life was never brought into conformity with the claims that they made.
[time=1702] You've read articles and so have I, a famous people because of their political position, or their leadership on a football field, or their prominence in music or theatre,
[time=1713] who've become believers in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1717] And we wait to see this marvelous change in their lifestyle, but there are no changes coming.
[time=1726] You and I have heard of someone down the hallway in the office across the way who was pretty wild,
[time=1735] rather ungodly, who accepted Christ and we think this is going to be tremendous as everyone sees their life changed.
[time=1741] They'll know that Christ is real, but there's nothing to see.
[time=1746] And then there are those who have been born again, and you wonder if there really was a new birth.
[time=1756] On the other spectrum, there are those who all of their life appeared to be followers of Christ, and suddenly their life is headed in a completely different direction.
[time=1765] They deny Christ.
[time=1767] I remember working at a church camp.
[time=1769] My first year I had an ornery 12-year-old, caused grief the whole week long.
[time=1774] On Friday night at a campfire, he received Christ. I was thrilled.
[time=1778] The next year I was the program director at the camp.
[time=1781] Young guy came back as ornery as ever, but that Friday night he received Christ as a savior.
[time=1786] The next year I was the Bible teacher at camp and came back as ornery as ever and received Christ again.
[time=1792] I was there five years.
[time=1794] I don't know what he did after five years, but he was born again, again, again and again.
[time=1799] Raises a serious question, doesn't it?
[time=1802] Can you be born again, again?
[time=1806] Or maybe it should be put this way.
[time=1808] Can you be born again and lose your salvation and need to be born again?
[time=1813] I remember Campus Crusade for Christ had an excellent program of saturation evangelism.
[time=1818] They were trying to saturate this country and other countries with the gospel, and they began with a billboard bumper sticker campaign.
[time=1827] The first one was a sign that said, "I found it." It was followed by, "You can find it too." And then the third statement, "New life in Christ." And for months there were billboards and bumper stickers all over the place that said, "I found it." Somebody came out with their own bumper sticker and said, "I never lost it." An interesting question, "Can you have Christ, lose Christ, and find Him again?
[time=1850] Can you lose your salvation?" Peter addresses some of these things in some rather stern language in 2 Peter, chapter 2, verse 20.
[time=1859] I invite you to open your Bible there with us this morning.
[time=1862] We're studying through the book of Peter and allow me just to set a little backdrop before we begin by reading verse 20.
[time=1870] Throughout this whole book, Peter has been talking about false teachers, and chapter 2 in particular is talking about false teachers.
[time=1879] And that's the context.
[time=1880] The false teachers and those who follow are whom he is addressing.
[time=1885] Chapter 2, verse 20.
[time=1888] "For if, after they have escaped through the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then they are again entangled in it and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning.
[time=1906] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
[time=1916] But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, the dog is returned to his own vomit and the sow that was washed to her own wallering in the mire."
[time=1929] Here Peter talks about people who've escaped the ways of the world and its pollutions, who've known Christ, who've known the path who've been washed.
[time=1939] Now he says of them it's going to be worse for them in the end than if they would have never heard about Christ or His plan from the beginning.
[time=1948] Because even though there was a lifestyle change in escape and there was knowledge, the final outcome was these people are under judgment in a great and serious way.
[time=1961] Now that leads us to a proposition.
[time=1965] Either these people, one, were genuinely born again.
[time=1972] They have genuinely received Christ and because of their conduct and their conversation they've lost it,
[time=1979] or two on the other hand, these people never genuinely came to Christ.
[time=1984] They just had a superficial appearance and in time it was proved that they didn't have the real faith.
[time=1991] But that's the case. Either these people knew Christ and lost their salvation, or these people appeared to know Christ, but were never, shall we say, saved in the first place.
[time=2001] Throughout history there have been various people who've written on the Bible, whose names have become associated with various belief systems.
[time=2009] Perhaps you've heard of the Calvinists and the Armenians.
[time=2014] There was a man by the name of John Calvin who in 1534 wrote a book entitled "The Institutes of the Christian Faith" and then he taught a number of things, one of which we call the perseverance of the saints.
[time=2027] That means that once somebody receives Christ as Savior, God causes that faith in their life to be effective so that they persevere throughout their whole life
[time=2036] and are never lost.
[time=2038] We call that the doctrine of eternal security.
[time=2041] There was another man by the name of Joseph Arminis.
[time=2045] Joseph Arminis was a theologian just to follow John Calvin.
[time=2049] Followers of him have said a belief in Armenian theology.
[time=2054] And their belief is that you can come to Christ and God will not cause you to persevere.
[time=2059] You may cause yourself to lose your salvation.
[time=2062] Now in all fairness to both John Calvin and Joseph Arminis, neither one of them believe most of the things we say they believed.
[time=2069] I doubt if John Calvin would believe everything that we say is Calvinism, and I'm sure Joseph Arminis did not believe in what we call our minimalism.
[time=2078] So let's take all those cliches, all those fancy theological words and just lay them aside
[time=2084] and focus our attention right on the scriptures this morning rather than me trying to support what I was taught in college or seminary
[time=2093] or trying to refute what you were taught in your various background.
[time=2097] To be honest, this is the Blackhawk Baptist Church and probably more than half of us did not grow up in a Baptist Church.
[time=2104] We're not here to expound Baptist theology against covenant theology.
[time=2110] We're here simply to study the scriptures.
[time=2113] Someone said, "Wouldn't it be great if we could just get all these various denominations together and get rid of all the labels and all the traditions and form one great big Baptist Church?"
[time=2123] You can borrow that and use it wherever you want to go next week.
[time=2130] But what we want to do today is not simply say what we have been taught, but simply to focus our attention on the scriptures.
[time=2140] And let me say first of all that this passage gives to us a strong appearance that these false teachers were indeed saved.
[time=2152] There's four statements in here that make me say that.
[time=2156] There is a strong appearance here that these false teachers are indeed saved.
[time=2160] First of all it says this, "For if they have escaped the pollutions of the world, that sounds like to me that there's this lifestyle over here that is ungodly that the Bible calls worldly to use a cliche.
[time=2174] And there's this lifestyle over here that is godly and pleasing to him, and this lifestyle represents those who are saved.
[time=2181] It sure sounds to me like they're saying, "If they've escaped this and made it over here, it sounds like they're saved."
[time=2189] Then there's the next phrase that follows, "If they've escaped through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they had knowledge of him."
[time=2198] The word to know in the Greek New Testament is the word genosco, and if you want to make something emphatic or intensive, you add the word epi.
[time=2207] And that's this word, epigenosco, which means they knew it thoroughly.
[time=2211] I mean they just didn't hear about it at a distance and dismiss it for lack of evidence they thoroughly knew about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2219] Again that makes me think that they were born again.
[time=2224] Then there's the phrase in verse 21 says this.
[time=2227] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness.
[time=2232] Again there's that intense word epigenosco, which means they thoroughly knew God's path of righteousness.
[time=2239] And then finally in the last verse of this chapter it says that they're being compared to a sow who was washed and returns to the mire.
[time=2250] It sounds like by way of analogy they're saying they were over here, but Jesus Christ has washed him and now they're over here, but like a pig they've run back to their dirt.
[time=2260] Now to be honest with you, that sounds like these people were truly saved.
[time=2266] Now many of you are scratching your head because you're saying wait a minute, I've been here a long time and I've heard you talk and I know you don't believe that a person can be saved and lose their salvation.
[time=2277] You're right, I do not believe that.
[time=2280] But I think it's important for us to see that those people who believe differently in the Lord Jesus Christ have reason for their belief, they just didn't draw it out of the air.
[time=2290] Most of the time our difference is that those who believe you can lose your salvation stand on one side and say I cannot believe that you can receive Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=2300] Go out and live any way you want to and you're still going to be saved.
[time=2305] Well that's not a theological argument, that is an emotional argument that says I can't accept that.
[time=2311] Well those of us who believe that you can never lose your salvation feel the exact same way.
[time=2316] We also do not believe that you can receive Jesus Christ as your Savior, go out and live whatever way you want to and ultimately be saved.
[time=2323] Your point is you were lost, were saved and then lost again, our point was you were lost, stayed lost and ended up lost.
[time=2333] The point is either this, back to our proposition, can a person lose their salvation?
[time=2338] As we look at this text the question is were they genuinely saved and then lost it or never saved in the first place?
[time=2344] And I wanted to be honest up front and say there is the appearance that these people were saved.
[time=2350] But that was only an appearance, look back at verse 1.
[time=2354] Now remember Peter wrote in a pistol, when he wrote it this was a letter.
[time=2359] That's what the word epistoloss means, it just means a letter.
[time=2362] Now most of your letters you don't write chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=2366] But Peter didn't either.
[time=2368] Hundreds of years later to help those of us studying the scriptures, men went in and said let's divide it here, here and here.
[time=2376] So don't see this as separate verses that don't go together, it all goes together.
[time=2381] It's one flowing letter.
[time=2383] And in chapter 2 verse 1 when he first started talking about these false teachers he said this, "As there were false prophets among the people, even so shall there be false teachers among you,
[time=2395] who secretly shall bring in destructive heresies, and note this, even denying the Lord,
[time=2402] even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
[time=2408] Peter's whole point about these false teachers is this, whatever these men teach you,
[time=2414] they ultimately are saying Jesus Christ is not Lord.
[time=2418] Their theology says Jesus Christ, good man, good teacher, good example, not God.
[time=2427] Right up front Peter tells us they are not believers, they are not believers.
[time=2433] He makes that very clear.
[time=2435] Which now leads us to say, well what about all of this evidence that we've already documented that makes it look like they're true believers?
[time=2445] Let's look at those phrases one at a time.
[time=2447] It says that they have escaped the pollutions of the world.
[time=2452] That phrase means that they were living over here in a lifestyle that was polluted
[time=2459] and they've now moved over here into an appropriate lifestyle giving the external evidence of a new birth,
[time=2467] giving the external evidence of the new birth.
[time=2471] But what the Scripture is telling us here is that external evidence can be deceiving.
[time=2476] Keep your attention in Peter, but look back at Matthew chapter 7, verse 7 for just a moment,
[time=2482] and Jesus deals with this directly.
[time=2485] And Matthew 7, 7, in what we call the Sermon on the Mount Jesus says this in verse 21,
[time=2491] "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[time=2498] Note that Jesus said, "Not everyone who says unto me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven." That phrase tells us a very important point.
[time=2506] And that is mere profession with our mouth does not equal true possession within our heart.
[time=2512] If you can remember anything, remember that.
[time=2514] Mere profession with our mouth does not equate true possession of Christ within our heart.
[time=2520] These people were running around saying, "Lord, Lord!" Jesus said, "Not everyone who says, Lord, Lord, shall enter into my kingdom, but he that doeth the will of God."
[time=2530] Now they say, "Wait a minute, Jesus, let us submit the evidence." They said, "Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?
[time=2543] Lord, have we not overcome the powers of evil and the forms of demons in thy name?
[time=2550] And Lord, in thy name, have we not done many marvelous works?" There it is, there's the evidence, Jesus. Truly, truly, we have all that it takes to get to heaven because we possess all the evidence that we need.
[time=2564] Notice Jesus' verdict.
[time=2566] Next verse.
[time=2568] "Then why profess?" Interesting that Jesus would choose the word profess.
[time=2572] They've just professed Lord, Lord.
[time=2574] And he said, "Then why profess?" You're making your profession?
[time=2577] I'll make mine.
[time=2578] Jesus, "Then why profess unto them I never knew you?"
[time=2585] What Jesus is saying there is important that we focus our attention on one word in particular, that is the word never.
[time=2593] Jesus didn't say, "Yes, I remember when you did that, but since you did that, you did these wrong things, and therefore I used to know you, but I don't know you anymore."
[time=2603] That's not what Jesus said. He said, "I never knew you," saying there was never a point in my knowledge, and he has it all, that I knew you.
[time=2615] His point was it's not that you had it and you lost it, the point is I never knew you.
[time=2619] And the whole issue at hand is does external evidence mean that you're truly a believer in Christ, and the answer obviously is no.
[time=2629] There are many, many people who come to this church or to a church like this.
[time=2633] They discover a whole set of values they haven't lived by, and they see that these values are advantageous.
[time=2639] They adopt these values, they say all the right things, but they never give their heart and their life to Christ.
[time=2646] And the last thing we want to put down is you changing your life to bring it in conformity with God's Word, but that is not enough.
[time=2654] You must give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2659] Secondly, we've got to deal with the occurrence of this Word no two times.
[time=2664] It says they have known the Lord Jesus Christ, and secondly they've known the way of righteousness, and again, let's be honest, this is the Word that means to know thoroughly.
[time=2674] I'd like to submit an explanation of this that none of us act upon all the knowledge that we possess.
[time=2683] Just because we know something doesn't mean that we are walking in obedience to this.
[time=2688] There are many, many people who know about Christ.
[time=2692] They know that he rose from the dead to prove that he was God.
[time=2695] They know they must receive him, they know it, they know it, they understand it, but they have not yet obeyed it.
[time=2701] And knowledge without obedience is empty, it's nothing.
[time=2706] Knowledge only has value and comes alive when it's brought into obedience, and by faith and obedience we receive Christ as our Savior.
[time=2716] Allow me to give an illustration.
[time=2719] Eight years ago, Kathy and I moved here to be in working with the church.
[time=2724] At that time I was five foot eight and a quarter inches tall and weighed 147 pounds.
[time=2729] I'm still five foot eight and a quarter inches tall, and I'm not going to tell you how much I weigh.
[time=2735] I know that I weigh too much.
[time=2738] In spite of that, my family's here this week and we're going out to a smorgasbord, and I'm going to eat all that I can,
[time=2745] and I'm sure I'll get my money's worth.
[time=2748] Now my knowledge says, "Trim it down, slow down, cut back." I know that, and I'm going to do it tomorrow.
[time=2756] When I was in high school in competitive swimming, I'd buy a 40 jacket and try to plead with the man to sell me the pants that came with the size 38 coat.
[time=2766] Now I buy the 40 jacket and plead with the man to sell me the pants that go with the 42 coat.
[time=2771] Things are moving in the wrong direction, and I know that.
[time=2777] But I don't obey it.
[time=2779] Let's be honest.
[time=2781] Any things that the Bible says that you know and you're not obeying, let's not show any hands, because all of ours would be up.
[time=2793] Knowledge does not equal obedience.
[time=2796] Just because these people thoroughly knew something doesn't mean that they ultimately obeyed it, and I submit Judas as Exhibit A.
[time=2807] Then finally, there's the statement about the sow that is returned having been washed to the wallering in the mire.
[time=2818] I think what Peter's whole point in citing the illustration of the dog and the illustration of the pig is that animals have within them a certain nature, a certain characteristic, a certain instinct, and no matter what you do to them, they're going to demonstrate that instinct.
[time=2831] What he is saying is basically, you can take a sow, a pig, and wash it.
[time=2836] And no matter how many times you clean a pig, it's going to go back to the mud.
[time=2841] Why? Because it's still a pig.
[time=2843] One man put it this way.
[time=2845] No matter how clean you get a pig, you'll not make a pig cleanly.
[time=2850] You see, within an animal, there's a certain nature.
[time=2853] We had a dog as I was growing up, and it was more domesticated than I was.
[time=2859] The last thing that this dog was was a hunting dog. It'd never been on a hunt. It'd never been out of a carpeted house.
[time=2866] One day in the woods behind ourself, our dog went back into the woods and came out with a bird in her mouth.
[time=2872] Now mind you, the bird had been dead for two or three weeks.
[time=2876] That dog was no hunter, but she came prancing all that woods with that bird in her mouth, head cocked eye, paws prancing, as though, look at me, the great hunter.
[time=2885] That was that dog's instinct.
[time=2888] Just its nature made it react that way.
[time=2892] And ultimately, no matter how well you train a dog and try to act like it's better than a dog, you know what it is?
[time=2899] It's a dog.
[time=2904] I'm going to make a little revelation about, you know, we all have family members that we don't necessarily want everybody to know everything about.
[time=2911] I have a great grandmother who used to dress up monkeys and take them downtown with her.
[time=2915] Do you know what? You can dress up a monkey and you can talk to him, but you know what? It's still a monkey.
[time=2922] It's still a monkey. You can pretend like it's not.
[time=2925] You know what you can do? You can dress yourself up like a Christian.
[time=2928] You can isolate yourself in a church. You can get around all the other Christians. You know what you are?
[time=2933] You're still a soul without Christ.
[time=2936] No matter how long you come here, no matter how much you attend Sunday school, no matter how much you put in the offering, no matter how willing you are to serve
[time=2944] until you receive Christ, you're still what you are by nature.
[time=2949] And that is a sinner until you receive Jesus Christ and then you're a sinner who's been saved, who's been changed.
[time=2959] Just like a sow who's been cleaned, it's ultimately revert back to its own nature until you have a new nature that comes by receiving Christ as Savior, it doesn't matter what you do on the outside.
[time=2973] Peter's whole point here is this. These people looked like talk like they knew Christ, but they ultimately didn't.
[time=2984] I think there are several, several important lessons for us to learn here. I'd like to focus our attention on at least these three.
[time=2993] First of all, I think it's important that we note this.
[time=2998] Don't be discouraged. Don't be alarmed because there are false professors of Christ.
[time=3013] Jesus warned time and time again that the church, meaning all Christians and this hunk of Christians called "black hog"
[time=3023] are going to be inhabited by a variety of people, including those who profess Christ, but who really don't know him.
[time=3032] In Matthew chapter 13, he gives several parables to illustrate what he is saying.
[time=3038] The parable of the sower tells about a man who went out and he scattered his grain and some landed on the rocks,
[time=3045] some landed in shallow soil, some landed in thorns and thistles, and some landed in good ground.
[time=3051] He was saying just because the seed went out doesn't mean that life existed.
[time=3055] The seed over here on the rock was snatched away.
[time=3058] The seed over here on the shallow ground looked like it was the real thing, but it died out.
[time=3062] It didn't have any depth of root.
[time=3064] This over here was choked out by thorns and thistles, which represented the cares of this world.
[time=3069] And this over here grew and prospered.
[time=3071] And you know what he was saying?
[time=3072] The seed goes out and it appears in a variety of soils and takes on a variety of manifestation, but not all are truly believers.
[time=3080] Then he gave another parable.
[time=3083] It's called the parable of the wheat and the tears, and I need to be honest with you.
[time=3087] I am a city slicker and know nothing about farming, but I'll trust the commentators at this point
[time=3094] that a tear is a weed that looks very, very similar to wheat.
[time=3099] And when they are growing up in the field together, it is nearly impossible to tell the wheat from the tears
[time=3106] until the harvest time and then they change color and their true colors are shown.
[time=3111] Jesus was saying in the congregation, there is going to be wheat and tears, true believers and false professors growing up side by side.
[time=3121] He said, "Just like the mustard tree, over there you look at it and it looks all like a tree." It's so bushy and thick and full and you say, "That's a mustard tree and you get close." And you discover that inside the mustard tree there is all kinds of birds.
[time=3134] I think what he was saying ahead of his time is there is going to be some strange birds in the church.
[time=3139] Some false professors when you take a closer look.
[time=3146] So he doesn't want us to be discouraged or to be alarmed and say, "Oh my goodness, the whole plan is shot because this one and this one and that one said it and didn't live up to it."
[time=3156] He said, "Don't be alarmed. There were false teachers, there are going to be false teachers, there are going to be false professors in the church."
[time=3166] Second important lesson for us to learn is this.
[time=3170] The Bible tells us that we should not judge anyone else's spirituality.
[time=3177] It's not our job to say that one over there.
[time=3180] That one is a real believer.
[time=3184] This one over here sure looks like it, but I know they're not.
[time=3188] You know, when the wheat and the tears were growing up together, Jesus said, "Don't pull out the tears lest you pull out some wheat by mistake."
[time=3197] He said, "But in the judgment and the harvest time, God will separate the wheat from the tears."
[time=3203] That's not our job to run around and pronounce.
[time=3205] This one is a Christian and to say that one is not a Christian.
[time=3210] That's God's job.
[time=3213] A third important lesson is this.
[time=3216] Even though it's not our job to judge someone else's spirituality, it is our job to judge your own.
[time=3222] The Bible says that we're to examine ourselves.
[time=3226] Could it be this morning that you are a mere professor and not a true possessor of Christ?
[time=3238] Someone has put it this way, that just because you possess light does not mean that you possess life.
[time=3247] By that they mean just because you possess light, insight, knowledge, revelation that you know about the Christian life doesn't mean that you know the Christ of the Christian life.
[time=3258] Just because you've conformed your life in some externals that are good steps to take doesn't mean that internally there's been a transformation of your heart by giving it to Christ.
[time=3267] Peter's driving at anything.
[time=3272] He's driving that you and I to examine ourselves so that we will know where are we spiritually?
[time=3279] Have you received Christ as your Savior?
[time=3283] Not just paying lip service to tradition, but with an open heart, receive Him.
[time=3288] You must have a new nature.
[time=3290] Jesus said you must be born again.
[time=3294] We began by asking the question, can you be or is there ever a time when you need to be born again, again?
[time=3303] The answer is no.
[time=3305] You do not need to be born again again.
[time=3308] But you must definitely and clearly be born again the first time.
[time=3312] Jesus said, "If you will receive Me, I am standing at the door and knocking.
[time=3317] If you hear my voice and will open that door to receive Me, He made two promises.
[time=3323] The first of which is this, I will come in.
[time=3327] The second of which is I will never leave you and I will never forsake you.
[time=3332] But the only way you can have Christ is to be born again and you only need to be born again once.
[time=3340] Today, are you a true possessor of Christ or could it be that you merely profess Christ?
[time=3348] The Bible says, "Be not deceived.
[time=3350] God is not mocked.
[time=3352] Whatsoever man so's, that shall he also reap in your life.
[time=3359] Have you sung wheat or have you sold tears?
[time=3363] Let us pray together.
[time=3366] For God and our Father, we are bowing before you.
[time=3371] And again asking you to be the one who would speak to our hearts.
[time=3377] God, we would ask you to speak first of all to the heart of someone who has been led to believe of themselves or by others that they have a relationship with you when really they do not.
[time=3392] God, I don't know who they are, but you do.
[time=3396] And we're asking you to do what your word promised when you said that your spirit would convict of sin and of righteousness and judgment.
[time=3404] God, right now, we pray that you would send light into each heart and that light would reveal to them where they stand spiritually.
[time=3412] God, we also pray for the believer today who has Christ but lacks the joy and assurance of their salvation.
[time=3421] We ask you today, Father, to give to them by your spirit a confirming witness that they belong to you, that their joy might be full.
[time=3430] Father, we pray for believers today who are struggling in their walk, that they're walking in disobedience.
[time=3437] And even though they possess Christ, their outward profession is weak, their conduct is wavering.
[time=3443] God, we pray that you'd put in their heart a fire that would call them to obedience so that your name would not be mocked.
[time=3451] Father, in this closing moments of assurance, I ask you to answer those words.
[time=3458] We've had a wonderful time today sharing with you the musical ministry of our special guest, Larnau Harris, and the preaching ministry of our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3468] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual life, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3475] Will you pray with me?
[time=3478] Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for me personally.
[time=3486] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3492] I ask you, Jesus, to come in today and to forgive me of my sins. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
