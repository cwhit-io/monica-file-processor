[time=60] - Good morning, and welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=64] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's The Bible Hour, with inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups, and soloists.
[time=72] (crowd chanting) Good morning, and welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=78] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's The Bible Hour.
[time=85] With inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups, and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=95] Join us, won't you, for The Bible Hour.
[time=99] (music)
[time=115] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=117] What a joy it is this morning to come, and to begin with that announcement, how great thou art.
[time=126] We come to praise God, and to worship Him, and songs like that lift our hearts.
[time=131] We welcome you this morning to this opportunity of worship and praise of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=138] Not only to those of you who are here, but also to our friends who join us for The Bible Hour.
[time=143] We wish to say welcome this morning, and trust that in your heart there is a desire to lift up your heart and praise to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=151] But not only do we come to worship Him, we come that we might express to Him the burden of our heart, to take the anxieties and the hurts that we carry, and to leave them in the lap, in the tender hands of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=166] As a body, we've known hurt, disappointment in recent days.
[time=170] We pray for those within the body who have suffered the loss of loved ones who fight the battle with cancer and other types of pain,
[time=178] surgeries, and yet to discover that God is not only great, but that He cares, that it invites us to leave all of our burden on Him, is the proclamation that our choir sings this morning.
[time=190] Is your burden heavy? Is your load great? Is it hard to bear? The Lord Jesus Christ has cast all of your care upon me, for I care for you.
[time=199] Listen to our choirs. They give us that song in ministry this morning.
[time=208] [MUSIC - 335 seconds]
[time=563] Thank you for singing those praises together as a congregation. Again, we appreciate it when you participate with us.
[time=570] Psalm 150 is a summation of praise to God, tells us to praise God in the sanctuary where we are today, praise him wherever we are, praise him for the mighty deeds that he's done, and just to praise him for his greatness.
[time=586] The quartet is going to sing a song now entitled "Praise the Lord," and as we sing, you praise him and thank the Lord for the great things that he's done for you personally. The quartet sings "Praise the Lord."
[time=599] [MUSIC]
[time=621] When you're up against a struggle that shares all your dreams, and your hopes have been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifestous means, and you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly feasts, don't let the faith you're standing on,
[time=650] seem to disappear, praise the Lord.
[time=658] If you are full of praise, you praise the Lord.
[time=666] For a God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you pray.
[time=694] [MUSIC]
[time=707] Now Satan, well he's a liar, and he wants to make us think that we are paupers when he knows himself were children of the king.
[time=723] So lift up the mighty shield of faith, for the battle must be won. We know that Jesus Christ is risen, so the work's already done.
[time=739] Praise the Lord, he can work through the surprising praise the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord, for the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless.
[time=767] [MUSIC]
[time=777] Praise the Lord, he can work through the surprising praise the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord, for God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord.
[time=795] For the chains that seem to bind you serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you pray.
[time=815] Praise the Lord, he can work through the surprising praise the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays, prays the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays the Lord, for a God in heaven sprays the Lord.
[time=844] [MUSIC]
[time=872] Snowy sunny morning is the living Christmas tree, which is not too far away.
[time=877] I got excited this morning, I listened to it rain for a long time, and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the snow.
[time=884] Some of you out there might not be too excited when we talk about snow already, but that reminds us of the living Christmas tree, Rick.
[time=890] Christmas in splendor and majesty is the title of our Christmas program this year, and I want to remind those that are watching today that the tickets are available next Saturday.
[time=901] November 17th at 9 a.m. in the Convocation Center.
[time=906] Rick, these are free tickets for the living Christmas tree.
[time=909] For all of the 14 performances, they go very fast.
[time=913] So we encourage those that are watching today that if you'd like to have free tickets for these performances, you can come next Saturday to the church, Blackhawk Baptist Church at state and lay mire and receive your tickets.
[time=926] You know, Pete, the number of people who are coming is always exciting, and the need to meet the demand for tickets is not easy.
[time=934] And many of you would like to call our right in, and we wish that we could say, "Yes, just call us and we'll send them to you."
[time=941] But I'm sure you can appreciate what a logistical nightmare it would be for us to try to send out 20,000 tickets by way of mail to various phone calls and notes that come.
[time=950] And the letter always comes after the tickets are gone, and that creates something less than good will and tidings of joy at Christmas time.
[time=958] So they have to come pick them up.
[time=960] Yes, we really encourage them to come next Saturday, because on Monday then we begin filling the orders of the groups that have requested tickets, and there seems to be an unusual number of groups that have requested tickets, and that means 60 to 100 tickets go at one time.
[time=976] So Saturday is the time. November 17th, we begin at 9 a.m. and we'll be here until 5.
[time=982] Pete, you mentioned that there are 14 public concerts, but we would probably be amiss if we didn't mention there's one other concert.
[time=989] The premier concert is a benefit concert for our school Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=994] It is a fundraising event, and if you would like information about the benefit concert so that you could come and support Blackhawk Christian School,
[time=1002] if you would simply call the church office at 749-8524, we'd be glad to give you that information.
[time=1010] Again, the phone number is 749-8524.
[time=1015] Are you ready for Christmas?
[time=1016] I think all the committees are functioning well, and it always gets more nerve-wracking as we get closer to it, but I think we have a good handle on it this year.
[time=1025] It doesn't bother me, maybe that's because I don't have much to do. I have a few things for you next week that I'll tell you about.
[time=1031] I'm going to be gone, didn't I tell you? Sorry.
[time=1034] We have a lot of fun here, serving together and serving the Lord, and we are thankful that we can share it with you.
[time=1040] One final thing we want to share with you today is this pamphlet entitled "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air."
[time=1047] Those of you who watch week by week know that we've been studying through the Book of 2 Peter, and Peter speaks very boldly and very directly.
[time=1054] At a group of people whom he calls "false teachers." 2 Peter 2 says, "Just as there were false teachers in the Old Testament times, so will there be false teachers among you as well."
[time=1067] How do you determine whether someone is a false teacher or not, whether their spirit is speaking in truth, or whether it's actually a spirit of air?
[time=1075] Well, I think the only answer is to search the scriptures.
[time=1079] Paul said to the Church of Berea that they were more noble than those of Thessaloniki because they searched the scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
[time=1088] Before you accept the word of any teacher, myself included, you need to search the scriptures so that you know the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=1097] This pamphlet unfolds in a pattern that gives you six Bible doctrines.
[time=1103] What the Bible has to say about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, then on the other side sin and redemption, salvation and retribution.
[time=1113] Then cross the top, it tells you what God's word has to say about each of those topics.
[time=1119] Then it speaks about what does the Christian scientists, the Jehovah Witness, Armstrongism, Mormonism, Eastern mysticism, and spiritualism teach about each of these doctrines.
[time=1130] Under Jehovah Witness, for example, and under God there is direct quotes given by their leading teachers throughout their generations.
[time=1139] It's not simply what this person says about that person.
[time=1143] These are direct quotes from the sources of Mormonism and Armstrongism, Jehovah Witness, and other groups.
[time=1150] We want you to be able to have this tool so that you'll be able to determine the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=1157] If you'll write to us, we've got about 30 copies in hand and we'll be getting more and we'll send it to you absolutely free if you'll write to us.
[time=1166] We encourage you to do that and to do it today. Pete, would you give him our address?
[time=1171] Yes, the people can write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1187] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us. We're going to go back to the live part of the Morning Worship Service with a trust in our heart that God will use it to encourage you and to strengthen your faith.
[time=1201] [MUSIC]
[time=1208] One day, a plain, village woman, driven by love for her Lord.
[time=1224] Recklessly poured out her valuable essays, disregarding the score.
[time=1240] But once it was broken and spilled out, her fragrance filled all the room.
[time=1256] Like a prisoner released from his shackles, like a spirit set free from the tomb, broken and spilled out.
[time=1279] Just for love of you, Jesus, her most precious, fresh, true, lavished on thee.
[time=1305] Broken and spilled out, and poured at thy feet.
[time=1321] In sweet abandon, let me be spilled out, and used up for thee.
[time=1340] Lord, your God's precious treasure, his love, and his own perfect son, said here to show me the love of the Father.
[time=1368] Just for love, it was done.
[time=1376] And though you're perfect and holy, you gave up yourself willingly, you spared no expense for my pardon.
[time=1400] You will use up and wasted for me, broken and spilled out.
[time=1415] Just for love of me, Jesus, God's own precious treasure, lavished on thee.
[time=1441] Broken and spilled out, and poured at my feet.
[time=1457] In sweet abandon, let me be spilled out, and used up for thee.
[time=1509] Thank you, Ron.
[time=1513] As a church, let us now turn to the Lord in prayer.
[time=1518] Father were reminded this morning in a song of the Lord Jesus Christ, that his body was broken, and his blood was spilled out, as an atonement of payment for our sins.
[time=1532] Father, may we learn that in Christ Jesus we're called to be broken and to spilled out.
[time=1540] Vulnerable, exposed, Father, may we discover today that in being used by our God we find fulfillment in our life.
[time=1552] God, you know that within my own heart there's a nature of self-protectivism, a spirit that says, "Watch out for me."
[time=1560] Yet God, your word calls us to self abandonment to lose our life for the sake of Christ.
[time=1567] Well, God, today, me, may we as a congregation learn the joy of being broken and spilled out.
[time=1574] Father, as we heard in a song of the 70s, may we adopt as our life the spirit that says, "Like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down."
[time=1586] God, give us the spirit of laying our lives down one for another, give us the spirit of being used for you.
[time=1594] Father, today, there are those even within this service that need to know of the strength, that when a life has been broken, that you restore.
[time=1604] For today, God, we're asking you to restore the hearts of those who've lost loved ones, for the woods and the spurlins who've lost a son.
[time=1614] We ask you today to minister to their hearts, to the Johnsons and the loss of a baby girl.
[time=1621] God, we give you our heart and its peace as an ask you to make and to rebuild.
[time=1628] We pray for those within our church who have lost the strength of their life, their health.
[time=1637] We ask you to restore a Judy Dable in the Mary Lampman and the dozens of others who bear within their body the pain of life.
[time=1646] God, we would ask you today to minister to that one who has been rejected and divorced as torn apart, not only their home, but their heart.
[time=1656] God, we pray today for those whose lives have been made shipwrecked, and as they found in you, a rock of refuge that you today would build their lives new and fresh and strong and fresh.
[time=1668] God, we pray today for the believer whose heart has been tied in knots, and who's been found in bondage, that you would set that believer free, that they might set their steps right, and their commitment to you might be fresh and new, even as the snow this day.
[time=1685] God, as we open your word, we'd ask you to speak to our hearts, to renew us and to restore us, to give us confidence in you and in your word, that in a world that would mock and that would scoff, we would have confidence.
[time=1700] Oh, God, plant within our hearts that boldness, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1709] Be honest, you really don't believe that one day this guy is going to come down out of the clouds, and all these people who were believers in Christ and who are dead are going to go out of the grave,
[time=1727] and then people are just going to start disappearing off of the face of the earth.
[time=1732] I mean, do you really believe that?
[time=1734] I mean, be serious.
[time=1735] I mean, it's one thing to have some religious convictions.
[time=1739] I mean, a little religion is a good thing.
[time=1742] You know, you can go too far even with a good thing.
[time=1745] I mean, this concept that God is going to send how many tribulations upon the earth?
[time=1751] I mean, do you really think that God's going to cause meat or rights to fall from heaven and pollute all the water?
[time=1759] I mean, isn't that what your Bible says?
[time=1762] Be serious.
[time=1765] Have you ever been confronted with such a mocking attitude?
[time=1770] Those that look at the Word of God and almost with the glib smile of superiority look down their intellectual skeptical nose and say,
[time=1780] "No, no, can't be scoffers."
[time=1789] Those who not only reject the claims of Christ and of His Word, but those who at the same time reject the people who do believe in Christ in His Word.
[time=1802] It's interesting that in the late 60s and early 70s, it wasn't much of a fad to be a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1813] It's become somewhat popular today.
[time=1816] But even in its rising tide, to be a Bible believer is a point of ridicule because there are those that deem it unintellectual,
[time=1829] but even appropriate for the times in which we live.
[time=1833] Yet I believe we can study God's Word with the confidence that His Word is true.
[time=1837] Tonight, we begin a new dimension of our ministry called the Sunday Night Bible Class.
[time=1842] We'll be studying the living Word of God.
[time=1844] And in this evening's message, we'll study why we believe the Bible is indeed God's Word.
[time=1849] But this morning from 2 Peter, the third chapter, we'll discover that God is aware and has a plan even for the attack that would come.
[time=1858] 2 Peter, chapter 3, verse 1.
[time=1862] This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you in both of which I stir up your pure mind by way of remembrance,
[time=1873] that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the Holy Prophets and of the commandments of us,
[time=1881] the apostles of the Lord and Savior.
[time=1884] Knowing this first, that there shall be in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying,
[time=1895] where is the promise of His coming?
[time=1898] For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.
[time=1909] For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water,
[time=1920] by which the world that then was being overflowed with water perished.
[time=1926] But the heavens and the earth which are now by the same Word are kept in store,
[time=1932] reserved to fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
[time=1941] But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing.
[time=1950] That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years, but as one day.
[time=1959] The Lord is not slack concerning His promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering,
[time=1967] not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
[time=1975] But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night,
[time=1982] in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also,
[time=1992] and the works that are in it shall be burned up.
[time=1997] Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?
[time=2008] Looking for in hastening unto the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens,
[time=2016] being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.
[time=2022] Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which dwelleth righteousness.
[time=2034] Where is the coming of His promise? I mean, if you really believe that Jesus Christ is coming again, isn't he a little late?
[time=2043] I mean, it's been told year after year after year. I remember when I was a little boy, I read a book,
[time=2049] it proved that Jesus Christ had to come back before that year was up. He didn't come.
[time=2055] I remember reading how Christians were in agreement with George Orwell that 1984, if the world makes it till 1984, it'll end.
[time=2064] It's mid-November. It's mid-November.
[time=2070] I mean, where is the promise of His coming? I mean, Isaiah said it, David said it a thousand years before Christ was born.
[time=2078] I mean, do you really believe that Jesus is coming again? I mean, and if the Bible says that Jesus is coming again and He hasn't,
[time=2085] why should we trust the rest of it? Peter writes, and his perspective is prepare for an attack.
[time=2094] Yesterday we were working on our roof. If it wasn't Saturday and I didn't know better, I'd say roofing is real close to hard work.
[time=2103] We were standing up on the roof, and we could hear the thunder of the clouds, but it wasn't thunder. It was airplanes.
[time=2110] Cloud cover was very low, and we couldn't see the airplanes, but I knew the familiar sound.
[time=2115] It was the Air National Guard out at Bearfield. They were prepared.
[time=2120] Going through the basics, standing on alert, going through their routines, being prepared, so that this nation's defense is ready.
[time=2129] Peter says, "I write to you today a second time so that you'll be prepared for an attack."
[time=2136] An attack that would come from those who find it best to mock the concept of being a Christian, particularly the prophetic promises that are yet to be fulfilled.
[time=2147] I can remember mockery. Going to Taylor University, a small Christian college, we were playing another college, not a Christian college.
[time=2155] They thought it was kind of cute that Taylor would kneel down on the field and pray.
[time=2160] When the band came out on the halftime and began to play, their men's cheer section would make fun of the band and yell, "Sing us a hymn, band! Sing us a hymn!"
[time=2170] Make fun of their Christians.
[time=2172] The man who led me to Christ, David Burnham, played football for Wheaton College, and he used to say that when he would go out for an extra point and he would kneel down to receive the snap to place it on the ground for the field gold kicker,
[time=2184] as soon as his knee touched the ground, they'd say, "What are you doing, Burnham, praying, praying?" Mocks.
[time=2191] Some of you know what it's like to be mocked.
[time=2194] You've tried to share your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2199] And your only response was one of subtle superiority that your faith in Christ may be necessary for you, but they didn't need it.
[time=2211] You may attend a secular university and live in a fraternity house or sorority house.
[time=2216] And someone invited you to an activity and you declined and they said, "Oh yes, we forgot. You're the preacher in the group."
[time=2225] You may work within a business.
[time=2228] And you may have been labeled and pushed aside because your faith in Christ.
[time=2234] You're the blunt of every joke.
[time=2239] You're mocked.
[time=2241] They scoff.
[time=2242] Are you prepared for that attack?
[time=2244] Peter says, "I write unto you, first of all, I want to give you some basic training." I think that's his first point.
[time=2250] Basic training.
[time=2252] Peter puts it this way.
[time=2254] First Peter puts us on a state of alert.
[time=2257] Look at verse one.
[time=2259] "I write in both of these epistles, first Peter and second Peter, with the purpose of putting you on alert."
[time=2266] He said, "I want to stir up your mind." Do you know what that means? It means to wake up.
[time=2270] When Jesus Christ was sleeping on one end of the boat, the disciples were in panic on the other end of the boat
[time=2276] and the sea was tossing the boat every which way, the disciples says it's time to wake up the Lord.
[time=2282] Peter says, "It's time for us to wake you up to put you on alert." Just like the firehouse, it's midnight, the men are sleeping and alarm goes off and they're immediately put into action.
[time=2292] Peter says, "I want to wake you up. I want to stir you up. I want to prepare you." You know, that's one of the main purposes of church, is to keep us on a continual state of preparedness.
[time=2304] Someone said, "I don't like going to church. They're always stirring up something." Well, if that's true of your church, it's a good church.
[time=2310] Sometimes we need to stir it up so we ask Larnell Harris to come.
[time=2313] Well, he can stir things up, can he? We can bring excitement anywhere.
[time=2317] That enthusiasm is contagious. It's stirring.
[time=2321] You know, our fellowship to each other is supposed to be stirring.
[time=2324] You know, the Bible says we're to provoke each other.
[time=2327] They say, "Well, that's a pretty good church then because a couple people here provoke me." Well, listen to the description. Hebrews 10, 24.
[time=2335] "Let us provoke one another unto love and unto good works." You know, this is supposed to be a stimulating experience.
[time=2344] It's like the half-time talk in a football game or a basketball game.
[time=2349] I mean, when Bobby Knight goes into the locker room, he stirs him up.
[time=2353] We can't necessarily repeat all he says, but it's motivating.
[time=2358] Peter says, "I want to motivate you. I want to stir you up. I want to put you on alert." That's part of a basic plan of defense, isn't it? To be alert.
[time=2367] And secondly, under this concept of basic training, Peter not only makes a statement to put us on alert, but Peter reminds us to remember the Scriptures.
[time=2378] He reminds us to remember the Scriptures. Look at verse two.
[time=2382] I'm trying to stir you up, Peter writes, that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken.
[time=2389] Now, a couple of weeks ago, maybe it's been a month ago, we were back in chapter one.
[time=2394] Came up with the concept that the Word of God was teaching that our roots have to sink deep in order for us to grow tall.
[time=2403] By way of illustration, I spoke of a bush in our front yard that I couldn't get out,
[time=2409] even with a toe-chuck in a chain.
[time=2412] I need to go back to that illustration because after that message, two or three people asked how Kathy got the bush out, and I'd like to straighten that matter up.
[time=2422] You know, we need to be like that bush, rooted deep.
[time=2426] And again and again, as you read the Epistles of Peter, Peter keeps coming back, sink deep in the Word, remember the Word, remember what was spoken.
[time=2435] It's interesting how he describes the Word that was spoken.
[time=2438] He uses two descriptions.
[time=2440] First he says, "The Word that was spoken of the Holy Prophets." The Hebrew Bible was divided into three sections.
[time=2450] The law or the Torah, which is simply Hebrew for law, contained the first five books of our Bible, Genesis, Exodus, the Vedicist, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
[time=2459] God's statement of his law through Moses.
[time=2462] They had a second section of their Bible that they called the prophets.
[time=2467] Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel.
[time=2470] Four prophets who wrote extensive works were called the major prophets because what they wrote was voluneness.
[time=2477] And then 12 other prophets who wrote smaller works and hence called minor prophets.
[time=2482] They were called the prophets.
[time=2484] Often in the Bible talks about the law and the prophets.
[time=2487] Those were those two sections of the Old Testament.
[time=2489] They had a third section as well called the sacred writings.
[time=2494] Those were the books of history and of poetry.
[time=2498] Poetry like the Proverbs and the Psalms.
[time=2501] Peter uniquely says remember the prophets.
[time=2505] Those who predicted the coming of Christ.
[time=2508] Of the 16 prophets, 15 of them, all of them except Jonah, had as their major theme the coming day of the Lord when Christ indeed shall come
[time=2519] and shall reign over all the earth.
[time=2521] And he says, "I'm stirring you up to remember that Christ indeed is coming.
[time=2525] There'll be mockers, there'll be scoffers, there'll be those that ridicule, but Christ indeed is coming." He said, "I want to take you back to the Word of God that you'll root yourself in it." And he says the holy prophets.
[time=2538] Then a second description he says, "And of the commandments of us, the apostles."
[time=2546] Now he is moving from what we call the Old Testament into the New Testament.
[time=2551] All 27 books have not been written at this point.
[time=2554] Many of them have not been written.
[time=2556] None of them have been collected together in a canon to form the New Testament, but Peter speaks with prophetic insight from God's point of revelation that the Old Testament prophets and what we're writing as commandments in the New Testament are equally the Word of God and where to sink our roots deep into it.
[time=2574] If there is an attack that is coming, the best defense is not for you
[time=2580] to take a course in apologetics.
[time=2582] I'm not knocking that tonight, we'll be studying apologetics.
[time=2586] We'll study why we believe the Bible to be the Word of God.
[time=2590] We'll talk about an a priori claim.
[time=2592] We'll talk about Jesus' support.
[time=2594] We'll talk about archeology and prophecy.
[time=2598] But the real defense is not to know the arguments.
[time=2601] The real defense against the false teachers is not to know everything, the false teacher teachers.
[time=2605] You know what the real defense is?
[time=2607] To know what God's Word is said.
[time=2609] To root yourself and Peter says, I'm writing to you so that I can stir you up, I can put you on the alert, and I can drive you to God's Word again and again and again.
[time=2620] Beloved, we are meeting in these moments right now to study God's Word.
[time=2626] Would you want today to grow and study God's Word?
[time=2630] Would you today want to be encouraged to study God's Word?
[time=2636] Would you today want to have insight and direction in the life, then study His Word?
[time=2641] Would you like to make your way fresh and clean?
[time=2644] Study His Word!
[time=2646] As Peter writes through two epistles and he comes to the second pistol in the very last verse,
[time=2652] he builds to a crescendo with these words.
[time=2655] But grow in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2662] To him be glory, both now and forevermore, amen.
[time=2666] What's God headed to?
[time=2668] And these epistles that we've studied, that you'll grow in the grace and the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2674] Study His Word.
[time=2676] Incorporated into your life.
[time=2678] Make it the reference point for your thinking.
[time=2680] Daily Consume it.
[time=2682] Now Peter moves on from this basic defense and he talks about man's attack.
[time=2689] He describes the scoffers.
[time=2691] Verse three.
[time=2693] Know this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust
[time=2699] and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming?" Verse five, for this they are willingly ignorant of.
[time=2706] He describes the scoffers in three ways.
[time=2709] First of all, he describes them as scoffers are people who pursue their own appetite.
[time=2716] A scoffer is someone who pursues their own appetite.
[time=2720] Each of us formulate individually an ethic.
[time=2724] As a nation we formulate laws to govern the ethic of a nation.
[time=2729] The question is how is that ethic arrived at?
[time=2734] Is ethic morality arrived at by referencing some pre-existing law?
[time=2741] When the framers of our Constitution sat down, they referenced two documents very closely.
[time=2748] John Locke's treatise on civil disobedience and the writings of a Frenchman, Montaneux,
[time=2754] and they referenced those.
[time=2756] Montesquieu would write, Locke would write, and they would say, "In these writings we now have a reference point." Or there is a reference point that comes not through historical writing, but through revelation what we believe God has said.
[time=2770] But you know where our ethic comes from today?
[time=2773] It comes from our appetites.
[time=2775] Do you know why a law is passed today?
[time=2778] It is passed simply with the reference to the appetites of the electorate.
[time=2784] That's why we have laws today that we as believers in Jesus Christ shudder at.
[time=2791] Because as a nation our appetite has become our ethic.
[time=2796] But it's not simply true of a nation, a nation is simply the collection of individuals,
[time=2802] individuals who live with their appetite as their ethic.
[time=2806] Peter says they walk after, they pursue their own lusts, their own appetites.
[time=2811] Secondly, though he says a scoffer is someone who are skeptical about God's word.
[time=2820] Scarfers are people who are skeptical about God's word.
[time=2825] Notice there is a key question that comes up and it says this.
[time=2829] Where is the promise of his coming verse 4?
[time=2833] And then an argument that says, "Ever since the time that our fathers died, even beyond that to the beginning of creation, all things remain the same."
[time=2845] Some of you can go back to your college textbook today and remember in a basic science class or in a geology class, a variety of laws that you and I were taught.
[time=2855] Laws like the law of gravity, the laws of thermodynamics.
[time=2861] This writer speaks of the law of uniformitarianism.
[time=2866] Do you remember that? Can you dust off those old science notes?
[time=2870] Uniformitarianism is a law that basically says this.
[time=2875] The world is a closed system of closed processes.
[time=2880] And any process that is going on today has always been going on throughout history.
[time=2887] And conversely, or in reciprocation, any process that went on in history since everything is uniform is still going on today.
[time=2897] You say, "What is this? Science class?" No, I'm not a science teacher.
[time=2901] But that is a key point in terms of our insight into God.
[time=2906] What these scoffers were saying is there's a closed system here.
[time=2909] Everything's remained the same since creation. Nothing ever changes.
[time=2913] And if you believe in uniformitarianism, then what you're saying is that there is either no God or if there is a God, God does not intervene and interrupt the cycles of nature.
[time=2923] They were skeptical. They said nothing's going to change.
[time=2926] It hasn't changed and it won't change.
[time=2929] Jesus isn't coming because God cannot interrupt the changeless laws of uniformitarianism.
[time=2936] They are skeptics.
[time=2939] Then finally, it says this.
[time=2942] That these scoffers are willful markers and rejectors of God's grace.
[time=2949] Verse 5, "For this they willingly are ignorant of." It's unimportant that you and I represent the cause of Christ with intelligence and sophistication and with the best information possible.
[time=2963] But when that happens, there is no guarantee that someone will believe our report.
[time=2969] You see, doubt takes on two forms.
[time=2972] There is the intellectual doubt that comes from the mind that says, "I do not have sufficient data to reach the conclusion that you're asking me to accept."
[time=2982] That's an intellectual doubt.
[time=2985] But there's a second type of doubt.
[time=2988] This doubt does not come from the mind. It comes from the heart.
[time=2991] It's the heart that says, "I don't want to accept the conclusion.
[time=2995] I don't want to consider the facts.
[time=2997] I reject the facts because I've already rejected the conclusion." That is the heart that willfully does not want Christ.
[time=3006] Here the passage is saying these scoffers are people who are rejecting the grace and the claims of Christ not because they intellectually don't have the data.
[time=3015] They just willfully don't want to receive Christ.
[time=3019] Someone is sharing Christ with an individual and they immediately say, "Well, if all this were so true and if God was so loving, so good, why did he even let an Adolf Hitler live?" Or, "If I accept Jesus Christ, what happens to the guy who's on the other side of the globe who has never heard about Christ?
[time=3036] Is God going to send him to hell for not believing in a Christ, a Christ that he never heard of?" And suddenly there's all these deep questions.
[time=3045] Most of the time those aren't questions of the mind.
[time=3048] They're objections of the heart.
[time=3050] And what this individual is doing is they're taking all of these questions and they're forming a barrier.
[time=3057] And they're building a barrier hoping that they can build their barrier high enough that they can hide from God.
[time=3063] And saying, "God, you can't see me because I'm behind this brick wall
[time=3069] of unanswered questions.
[time=3071] God, I don't want to believe in you and I don't feel obligated to believe in you because I've got this excellent barrier to hide behind.
[time=3079] Are you hiding from God today?
[time=3082] What is it that you're hiding behind?
[time=3085] Are you hiding behind the fact that there's someone who you know is a born-again Christian and there's in propriety in their life?
[time=3095] And so you're hiding behind their hypocrisy.
[time=3098] Are you hiding today because you know of a church and you know what goes on in that church?
[time=3104] Oh, they sing one thing, but boy do they live another.
[time=3109] So you're hiding behind the poor testimony of another assembly of people?
[time=3116] David writes Psalm 139, "Wither, can my soul flee from God?
[time=3121] Where can I hide?" And David says, "There is nowhere that I can go that thou, O God's, aren't already there.
[time=3130] Before you can build your brick wall, God's already on your side, helping you on the shoulder and saying, "Here am I, here am I."
[time=3140] You can't, by your own will, block God out.
[time=3144] Oh, you can mock, but he'll still be there.
[time=3147] He'll still be there.
[time=3150] To this skeptical attack, Peter gives an answer.
[time=3156] We've talked about basic training, being prepared.
[time=3159] We've talked about man's attack that would come from scoffers.
[time=3163] Now Peter writes that God has an answer.
[time=3167] Let me give it to you in four parts.
[time=3170] God's first answer is this.
[time=3172] You need to note God's past dealings.
[time=3176] The flood proves that he will judge the world.
[time=3180] Look at verses five and six and seven.
[time=3183] You'll discover they say, "Everything's been the same." And Peter says, "Oh, no, it hasn't been the same." You don't think there'll be a coming day when Christ reigns, because everything's the same.
[time=3196] Peter says, "I'm here to tell you, everything has not always been the same." The world that God originally made was destroyed by water.
[time=3203] And just as God one time judged the world so he'll judge it again, uniformitarianism may be a norm, but it's not a law.
[time=3211] Note God's past dealings.
[time=3214] Secondly, he says an answer, "God's own nature." He is timeless is part of the answer.
[time=3224] It says that God is timeless, that a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years, but is a day.
[time=3232] Someone has argued that means it's been two thousand years since Christ came.
[time=3236] That's only two days to God.
[time=3238] That's not the point.
[time=3240] It also says that a day is a thousand years.
[time=3242] That means you've got to take two thousand years, multiply that by 365 days, and multiply that by a thousand.
[time=3251] And I can't do that much math.
[time=3253] What he is saying is this is eternity, and God is timeless.
[time=3258] God is not limited to time.
[time=3260] He has always existed.
[time=3261] He always will.
[time=3262] And days, years, months, whatever, it's not relevant with God.
[time=3267] His promises stand, and they're not measurable by time,
[time=3273] because God Himself is timeless.
[time=3275] Have you ever tried to fan them eternity?
[time=3278] Somebody defined eternity as the time period between two paychecks.
[time=3282] But other than that definition, have you ever just stopped and tried to think
[time=3288] into the future of existing forever and forever and forever?
[time=3292] Like John Newton wrote, "When we've been there ten thousand years." I can't imagine that.
[time=3297] Now, with standing here at a finite point in time and looking in the future, we can't imagine that.
[time=3303] Now stand here and say, "God existed and eternity passed." And time becomes an insubstantial argument, because God Himself is timeless.
[time=3315] Thirdly, Peter argues this way.
[time=3318] God's own desire.
[time=3320] He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
[time=3326] Peter is arguing that even though it looks like he should have come by now, God's own purpose is that you and I might come to Christ.
[time=3335] He's delaying so that we might be one to Christ.
[time=3338] So that that individual says, "Where's the promise of His coming?" God said, "I wanted to come, but I'm waiting so that you can come to Christ."
[time=3348] God has an absolute will, and where His will is absolute, what He wills will happen.
[time=3353] If God wills that it's snow today, it's going to snow in His absolute will.
[time=3357] But God has another will that is not absolute.
[time=3361] That will can be best translated by the word desire.
[time=3365] God willed and the world came into existence.
[time=3368] That was absolute.
[time=3369] God desires you to come to Christ.
[time=3372] That is not absolute.
[time=3373] Why?
[time=3374] Because God gave you a will, and He'll never use His will to violate your will.
[time=3378] He only desires you to come to Christ.
[time=3382] Would you come to Him today?
[time=3384] Would you open up your heart and receive Him?
[time=3387] He desires to know you and have fellowship with you, but you must come to Him.
[time=3392] Finally, He argues from a fourth reference point.
[time=3396] Let me review these.
[time=3398] He argues from God's past dealings.
[time=3400] He will judge the world.
[time=3402] He argues from God's nature that He's timeless.
[time=3404] He argues from the perspective of God's desire that He's delaying that we might be one to Christ.
[time=3410] And finally, He argues from God's ultimate plan.
[time=3413] He says ultimately, God's plan is that He will judge the world and everything that exists will be consumed by fire,
[time=3420] and it will create a new heaven and a new earth.
[time=3425] But until that time, out of His love, He's delaying and waiting so that you can come to Christ.
[time=3433] Would you today receive a Savior?
[time=3436] Even the ones that scoff and mock.
[time=3439] He's saying, "I died for your sins. Will you believe in Me?" To those who've ignored impassively and with difference, He said, "Will you believe?" The Scripture says to as many as who do receive Him.
[time=3450] To them, He gave the power to become the children of God.
[time=3453] Would you receive Him today?
[time=3455] I pray that you will.
[time=3469] You've been listening to the Bible Hour, the weekly telecast from the Black Hawk Baptist Church with our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3484] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual life, we'd like to pray with you.
[time=3490] Will you pray with me right now?
[time=3493] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3500] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3506] I ask You, Jesus, to come in today.
[time=3509] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3513] Please write us and tell us the nature of your decision, and when You write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision."
