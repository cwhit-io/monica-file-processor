[time=30] (bells ringing)
[time=61] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=65] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=73] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=83] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=86] [MUSIC - 11 seconds]
[time=104] - Sing together the last stanza.
[time=111] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=174] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=175] - It's with a joyful heart that we come this morning to praise and give worship to our God and Savior.
[time=183] We anticipate this week as families the celebration of thanksgiving.
[time=188] It's a time of tradition where we go home to grandma's house and we eat traditional meals, but most of all in our hearts it ought to be a day that we give thanks to God.
[time=197] Even if we have called ourselves Christians today, assemble, we've come to give thanks to our God, to say of him, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and praise." And then beyond that, to say that God, we give thanks unto you for your faithfulness, your goodness to us that you've given to us, your son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=219] Today, we anticipate thanksgiving.
[time=221] We're delighted that as a church, we can assemble today and sing praises.
[time=225] Now thank we our God.
[time=227] I trust it in your heart.
[time=228] There's a spirit of thanksgiving today.
[time=230] We welcome you to our worship service and say a word of welcome to our friends who are joining us for the Bible hour and trust that in each heart today, there's a spirit of thanksgiving unto God.
[time=242] He's been good to us.
[time=243] His faithfulness is great.
[time=245] Our choir sings this morning of that truth.
[time=247] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=250] (upbeat music)
[time=287] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=418] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=533] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=684] - Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=692] We appreciate it when you sing praise to the Lord with that kind of enthusiasm.
[time=697] This is a week of Thanksgiving, a time to rejoice and the good things that God has done for us.
[time=704] We thank the Lord for the special music that he brings our way from week to week to bless us, to minister to us.
[time=711] We have regulars with us today and we're always grateful for those that are a regular part of our congregation.
[time=717] Kerry Johnson's going to be singing in a moment.
[time=720] I say regular because Stephen Maria Gardner are with us today.
[time=725] They're members of our church.
[time=726] They travel an awful lot, but we're just gonna claim them as our own today as they minister to us, but let's listen first to Kerry as she sings a song concerning our own personal witness of Jesus Christ to those around us.
[time=739] Listen as Kerry sings for us.
[time=742] (gentle music)
[time=758] [MUSIC - 199 seconds]
[time=974] (gentle music) - Hello, and again, we want to welcome you
[time=983] to the Bible Hour.
[time=985] Pete, how are you this morning?
[time=986] - I'm fine, I guess I'm rejoicing in the Lord, Rick.
[time=989] We have so many things to be thankful for, don't we?
[time=991] - We certainly do, and as we approach Thanksgiving, that has to be the dominant theme of what's in our hearts.
[time=998] That's quite a statement for you to make as you come up on the Living Christmas tree to be thankful.
[time=1002] - There are a lot of responsibilities yet to be completed, but we have a lot of good workers.
[time=1008] I was amazed Friday when we were filling the church orders for the Living Christmas tree tickets, and then yesterday morning at eight o'clock, there were people waiting in the foyer.
[time=1017] We opened the doors at nine o'clock, and we had some 16 workers, and by 20 minutes to 10, everyone had been serviced, and I was just amazed at the way our people worked yesterday.
[time=1027] - You know, one of the strengths of the ministry here is the number of people who sacrifice of their time and their energy to serve the Lord, and that team spirit really makes it a joy to serve here.
[time=1037] - That makes the Living Christmas tree really exciting, not only for the musicians, but all the people in our church.
[time=1043] I suppose I might tell those that are viewing that the December 14th concert is already full, and the three concerts on December 15th, but there are tickets available for the concert on the 16th, and we begin again December 19th, 20th, 21, there are three concerts on the 22nd and three concerts, that is two concerts on the 23rd, and there are tickets available by coming to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and they're going very fast, Rick, but there are tickets available for those concerts.
[time=1074] - No, Pete, I look forward to the Living Christmas tree, not just because it is a majestic way of celebrating the Lord's birth, and it's exciting, but for us as a church, it's somewhat of our Christmas present to the community.
[time=1087] It's our way of announcing the Lord Jesus Christ and sharing the love that we have for him with this community, and I just want to say a word of thanks to you and the music department for doing it in such an excellent way here and up.
[time=1100] We really appreciate that, gives us a chance to proclaim Christ to probably this year somewhere between 15 and 20,000 people, and that is certainly a privilege and a joy, and we look forward to it.
[time=1111] We want to invite you to come.
[time=1112] We have 14 public concerts, four of them are already taken, but there are 10 concerts left, and if you would like tickets, just come by the church office, and we'd be glad to share the tickets with you.
[time=1124] They're absolutely free.
[time=1125] We want you to be able to come and to be able to invite your friends.
[time=1129] What's the music this year?
[time=1131] - The music is taken from a musical by Otis Gillings, and it's called Christmas in Splendor and Majesty, and then we're going to have some other individual performances by our handbell choir.
[time=1144] That's a new addition to our Living Christmas tree, and that's going to be very unique.
[time=1149] We have some new groups to introduce to our people, and it'll be an exciting time.
[time=1153] - Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[time=1155] I would like to mention to you as well, that on December the 13th, we have the premier dinner concert, the Living Christmas tree.
[time=1162] It is a benefit concert that goes to our school, Blackhawk Christian School, and if some of you are looking for a way that you can support Christian education or the Living Christmas tree, we'd want to invite you to call us at 749-8524.
[time=1179] Again, our number is 749-8524, and we'll be glad to give you the details of the benefit concert to support Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=1188] Pete, that's not too many days away, and we sure appreciate the hard work you're doing.
[time=1193] - Thank you.
[time=1194] One final word that we'd like to share with you is a gift.
[time=1197] It is a pamphlet that we would like to send you free as a gift from us to you.
[time=1202] It's entitled, "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air." As we study the scriptures this morning, we're going to come to Peter's final words, and in those words, he reminds us to have doctrinal soundness, and we live in an age where doctrinal soundness is eroding away very, very quickly.
[time=1219] This pamphlet is called, "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air," and I want to open it up and show you how it works.
[time=1226] This pamphlet is put together by Moody Bible Institute, one of the finest Bible colleges in our country, and as you'll notice across the top, it gives you various groups, the Word of God, and then groups like Christian scientists, spiritualists, Jehovah Witness, Armstrongism, Mormonism, and Mysticism.
[time=1243] Then as you go down, it tells you what each of these groups has to say about the person of God, the person of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit.
[time=1251] Then on the backside, it talks about sin and redemption.
[time=1254] It talks about salvation and retribution.
[time=1257] To give you an illustration of what we're talking about here, under the person of Christ, the Word of God says that Jesus always existed in eternity past as God and came into human form at Bethlehem.
[time=1270] But Armstrongism, on the other hand, says, "Before Jesus was conceived by Mary, he was not the Son of God." As you can see, there is a great heir in the teaching of Armstrongism, and that is a group that teaches a lot of truth, but they mix in with their truth a great deal of air, and we want you to be warned today.
[time=1290] And so we'll send you this pamphlet so that you'll be able to open up your Bible, and with the help of this pamphlet, you'll be able to discern the spirit of truth from the spirit of air.
[time=1300] In first John chapter four, the beloved apostle writes, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they be from God.
[time=1311] With the growth of television, radio ministries and cassettes and books were inundated, were flooded with various groups teaching, we need to be able to discern the spirit of truth and the spirit of air." If you'll write to us today, we'll send it to you free.
[time=1326] Pete, would you share with our friends how they can receive this?
[time=1329] Yes, please write to the Bible hour.
[time=1331] The address is box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1338] That's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1345] Pete, as we go back to our morning worship service, we're thankful for all the musicians, but I have a special spot in my heart for Steve and Maria Gardner, who are members of our church, but we don't have the privilege of fellowshiping with them too much because their ministry of music takes them literally all over the country, and they're not home all that often, but today we have the joy of sharing together in their ministry of music.
[time=1368] We trust that it'll be a strength through your heart, and it will take your heart and lift it and bring praise to God.
[time=1374] Stay with us now, as Steve Maria, a minister to us in song.
[time=1379] [MUSIC]
[time=1383] Never was anyone like him.
[time=1402] Never will would be the same.
[time=1409] Tiny baby, infant King, Savior.
[time=1416] We worship and honor the power of his name.
[time=1422] Where he was, love was there all so.
[time=1437] Where he went, love showed the way.
[time=1443] Those who saw knew he was holy.
[time=1450] And I see what they saw to this very day.
[time=1456] Oh, he came special, delivering, wrapped up in love,
[time=1464] bound by a promise sealed by a dark field,
[time=1472] with the spirits who carry thy grace.
[time=1477] You knew where he was going, by the look on his face.
[time=1494] When I'm cold, I will go gladly.
[time=1499] I will not grieve for the past, for I know where I'll be going.
[time=1512] And I will be going to see him at last.
[time=1521] I'm going special, delivering, wrapped up in love,
[time=1528] bound by a promise sealed by a dark field,
[time=1536] with the spirits carried by grace.
[time=1541] You know where I am going, by the look on my face.
[time=1547] I'm going special, delivering, wrapped up in love,
[time=1555] bound by a promise sealed by a dark field,
[time=1562] with the spirits carried by grace.
[time=1568] You know where I am going, by the look on my face.
[time=1576] By the look, the look on my face.
[time=1582] Special, delivering, special, delivering,
[time=1589] special, delivering.
[time=1593] Jesus Christ came special delivery from the heart of the Father to you and me, to bring us redemption, to reconcile us to God, to give us eternal life and life abundant on this earth.
[time=1607] We have a great deal to be thankful for, and this morning, among other things, we're really thankful to be able to be home for a change on Sunday, to be able to worship with friends, and to be able to benefit from the message of our favorite pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=1622] Probably the thing that we are most thankful for, and I think I would speak for all of us, is the fact that Jesus Christ, while we were yet sinners, came to die in our place.
[time=1633] And when we think of what this world would be like, what our lives would be like, if that were not true, what we would have to look forward to if he had not come, we quickly recognize that his name is certainly the sweetest in all the earth.
[time=1648] [MUSIC - 371 seconds]
[time=2022] Thirty years.
[time=2025] What would you say after 30 years of laboring with a group of people?
[time=2030] For over 30 years, Peter poured his life into people.
[time=2034] He began in Jerusalem from there to Antioch, from Antioch to Asia Minor, from Asia Minor to Rome.
[time=2041] He had crossed three seas.
[time=2044] He had sailed on the ocean waters of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Aegean.
[time=2050] He would live on two continents.
[time=2052] He would live in many languages that he did not know.
[time=2058] He had taken under his wing literally the responsibility of pastoring thousands and thousands.
[time=2064] He was a pioneer going down avenues that no one else had gone for 30 years.
[time=2071] For 30 years, he knew the joy of seeing people come to Christ even in multitudes.
[time=2077] For 30 years, he knew the triumph as the gospel would cut into a new culture.
[time=2081] Into another society, there would be the importation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2087] He knew that triumph.
[time=2089] He knew the triumph that would come as a church that would begin in an upper room with 11 disciples
[time=2096] that would meet with 120 for prayer that would penetrate the society not only of a Jewish
[time=2102] world but would make the might of Rome take up notice.
[time=2109] Yet for 30 years, he knew the pain of loving people to Christ and seeing them fall away.
[time=2116] He knew the brokenness of heart of leaders that were able, who became disabled because
[time=2122] of sin in their lives.
[time=2125] He knew the tragedy of congregations that were built upon the Word of God that would
[time=2131] be infiltrated by those who would teach falsely and would lead astray.
[time=2138] He knew what it was like to stand before a hostile world and to name the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2143] He knew what it was for 30 years to fight against the Romans, not with sword and spear,
[time=2152] but the sword of the Word of God.
[time=2156] It's now 65 A.D. for 30 years, Peter is labored.
[time=2162] He sets down and his own hand is not able to write, so Sylvanus writes, the dictated
[time=2170] message of Peter, five chapters in a pistol that we call First Peter.
[time=2176] From Roman bondage that he describes as Babylon, a pseudonym to disguise the identity and then
[time=2184] a second time he would write.
[time=2187] After 30 years of ministry, after 30 years of suffering, after 30 years of triumph, he
[time=2193] now knows that his life is coming to an end.
[time=2199] He says, I write you this second epistle beloved to put you in remembrance of these things.
[time=2208] Second Peter, his last writing, anticipating that he would be put to death and indeed he
[time=2214] was, crucified by the mad Nero, Peter said I'm not worthy to die as my Lord did die, and
[time=2223] his final request was given that he would not be crucified as the Lord was, so they hung
[time=2229] him upside down on the cross.
[time=2233] What would you say?
[time=2235] What would be your final instructions?
[time=2238] What would be your parting words after 30 years?
[time=2244] Second Peter, chapter 3, verse 14, wherefore, beloved, beloved, seeing that ye do look for
[time=2258] such things be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blemish.
[time=2272] And account that the long suffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our beloved brother
[time=2278] Paul, also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you.
[time=2285] As also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard
[time=2291] to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable dressed as do they the other scriptures
[time=2298] unto their own destruction.
[time=2301] Ye therefore, beloved, seeing that you know these things before, beware, lest ye also,
[time=2311] being led away with the air of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness, but grow
[time=2318] in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to him be glory, both
[time=2329] now and forevermore.
[time=2334] Final instructions, parting words.
[time=2338] Peter has written what he anticipated to be the last words that would come to the people that he has loved through life, to the people that he can only describe, not by geographical
[time=2349] location, but by the endearing word, beloved.
[time=2355] Four times in chapter 3, he says to them, beloved.
[time=2360] One of that heart of compassion would come, a reminder, instructions, thoughts to prepare
[time=2369] a people to be without a leader, by inspiration of God though not only written to them but
[time=2376] to us also.
[time=2378] He begins with a connecting word, a logical word, the word wherefore.
[time=2383] It is a word that would be used in a logical argument.
[time=2386] It says, based upon what you already know, then the logical deduction that you can make is this.
[time=2393] What as he said in preceding, "He has said that we look forward to the coming day of the Lord, when the Lord Jesus Christ shall indeed return, set up his kingdom."
[time=2403] You'll remember there are those that say, "Oh, Peter, we've heard that for 30 years." Now we say, "Peter, we've heard that for 2,000 years." But Peter reminds us, God is timeless.
[time=2415] A day is about 1,000 years and 1,000 years but a day.
[time=2420] We still look today for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2425] Now he uses a logical word, "If we and then say that our hope is in Christ, if we then say all of history centers around the person of Jesus Christ, and he is the central point
[time=2437] of history, not economic determinism as Marxism would teach, if he indeed is the culmination
[time=2443] of history, then how ought we then to live?
[time=2447] Wherefore, he gives us instruction, final instruction, these three.
[time=2454] First of all, he says that we are to live with this standard, that we are to be pure
[time=2460] in character, pure in character, wherefore, beloved, sing that you look for such things
[time=2467] as you anticipate the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, be diligent to be found of him in
[time=2474] peace without spot and blemish.
[time=2478] Peter focuses in again and again in all three of these sections of Peter's epistle that we
[time=2484] call the second chapter.
[time=2485] Chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, every chapter comes back to our character, our character.
[time=2493] There is no greater test that the world has of our faith in our character.
[time=2498] Oh, we can build great arguments, but they really want to know our character.
[time=2505] Writing in the 1930s, Sinclair Lewis writes of Elmer Gantry, evangelist, preacher, man
[time=2515] who declares righteousness but who is entrapped in false prey to the temptations that he would warn others of.
[time=2523] As Elmer Gantry wrote, he wasn't trying to create simply one illustration or one story.
[time=2529] He was trying to make a statement, and his statement was, as I look at those who call themselves Christians, I see Elmer Gantry, I see talk, I see words, I see stages, but
[time=2540] I don't see life.
[time=2544] He was pointing an indicting finger at a culture that we call evangelical Christianity.
[time=2551] And Sinclair Lewis would say, "Where is your integrity?
[time=2555] Where is your integrity?" He says, "Take diligence that you be found of him.
[time=2564] Kerry could not have sung a prettier or more appropriate song, that the only Jesus this
[time=2570] society is going to see is what they see in us, that they see in us.
[time=2577] Therefore, take diligence that you are a pure in character, that integrity.
[time=2583] That integrity is saying there is no gap between that which we talk and the way in which we
[time=2589] walk integrity, closing the gap." He says that we be found in him of peace.
[time=2596] You know, one of the marks of integrity and character and purity of character is peace.
[time=2602] The Bible says time and time again, "Blessed are the peacemakers, that the servant Lord
[time=2608] must be peaceable, that the wisdom that comes from God is this, first of all peace."
[time=2614] One of the greatest signs of the Lord Jesus Christ reigning in our hearts is that we're men and women of peace, and not strife.
[time=2624] Rehoboam and Rehoboam are two historic figures out of the Old Testament.
[time=2628] Rehoboam was the son of Solomon.
[time=2630] By law of primogenitor, he was to become king over Israel, and the leaders of the people gathered and they said, "Rehoboam, we will gladly serve you as our king.
[time=2640] Just do one thing, promise us that you will be less harsh than your father."
[time=2647] Rehoboam requests time to deliberate.
[time=2651] In the time that is given, he goes and he makes inquiry of the wise men, the elders, and they say, "Your father was a demanding man, and their request is reasonable.
[time=2661] Give them what they request, and they will indeed gladly serve you for your life." They spoke words of peace and conciliation.
[time=2668] Rehoboam then went to the younger men who were full of fire and fury.
[time=2675] They said, "You go tell them if you think my father was tough.
[time=2680] You wait till I rule over you.
[time=2684] My father was after you with whips, but my whip will be tailed with a scorpion."
[time=2690] He took the words of strife, and he spoke them, and he lost the kingdom.
[time=2697] He lost the kingdom because he failed to learn the value of being found in him of peace.
[time=2707] The scripture says in Hebrews 12, 14, that we are to pursue our follow peace with all men.
[time=2713] Do you know there are some that it's easy to live at peace with?
[time=2715] There are some people that I just, my heart, wells up with peace.
[time=2721] Then there are others.
[time=2726] One of the TV shows, I'm going to make a confession here, that I enjoy watching every once in a while.
[time=2733] Not a weekly habit, but just every once in a while is the A-team.
[time=2735] Do you ever watch that?
[time=2736] Very sophisticated show.
[time=2740] The A-team, it follows the same plot every week.
[time=2744] You're introduced to a bad guy, and I mean, it's always a really bad guy, you know, someone who went to college in major and being a creep.
[time=2751] And by the first 15 minutes in the show, they've got you hating the bad guys.
[time=2756] And of course, the call goes into the A-team, and the A-team very calmly arrives on the scene and blows them up.
[time=2762] It's rather an interesting show, they'll blow up a car, it'll flip 15 feet in the air, come down and land on its head, and three people crawl out fine, but that's television.
[time=2770] But you know what attracts me to the A-team, this is just being transparent.
[time=2776] Because sometimes in my life, there are people I'd like to blow up.
[time=2782] And you're laughing and nodding your head because there are people that get under your skin, and you'd like to call the A-team, wouldn't you?
[time=2789] You'd like to call the A-team and show them you're tougher.
[time=2793] You know what, those attitudes kind of make us laugh, but they kind of cut deep, don't
[time=2799] they?
[time=2800] I mean, there's someone in your life who was the soul of your life.
[time=2805] The one who ruled over you, who was your boss, who was your authority, and who was not only inept of it insane, unreasonable and unbearable, oh, and you long for the day to tell him exactly
[time=2819] how you felt.
[time=2820] You look for the day that he would lean back on the back two legs of his chair, and you could kick it out from under him.
[time=2829] Perhaps there's someone in your life who was a neighbor, a fool, and you're married to
[time=2838] him.
[time=2839] And he is in every biblical sense of the word, a fool, and you long for a David to come into
[time=2846] your life and rid you of him.
[time=2851] Scripture says that we're to be found in him of peace, that we would learn the axiom
[time=2859] of Proverbs 15.1, a soft word turns away, wrath, grievous words stir up anger.
[time=2868] You know, I cannot remember being in trouble very many times in my life that it wasn't my mouth that got me there.
[time=2875] My feet haven't gotten me in trouble very often, neither of my hands, but my mouth has
[time=2881] been a source of constant turmoil.
[time=2885] Live at peace, it's the mark of character.
[time=2890] Then he moves on and he says, "Not only peace, but spot." Did you ever have a favorite outfit, favorite coat, favorite shirt?
[time=2898] For me it's usually a tie.
[time=2901] Usually take care of that.
[time=2902] You can tell my favorite ties I wear them every other day.
[time=2906] I had a favorite tie, this burgundy had small little marks and blue in it.
[time=2913] I have 15 ties in my closet, they're all blue and burgundy.
[time=2916] This is blue and burgundy, you may have noticed that.
[time=2919] It was my favorite, had some wear marks on there, but if I tied it, just right I could hide it.
[time=2924] Then I spilled my lasagna on it.
[time=2926] It's a good shot, dead center.
[time=2930] No problem.
[time=2931] I just wore a vest every day.
[time=2933] Did you ever have a spot that you just needed to cover up?
[time=2939] Because it's right there and it's obvious and everyone's going to see it.
[time=2944] I kept that tie.
[time=2947] Don't go out and buy me another one, I'm too picky.
[time=2950] I still have got it and occasionally I wear it with a vest, but there's a spot on it.
[time=2957] That spot ruined it.
[time=2960] You know our lives can be in order, but if there's that one spot, God sees it.
[time=2968] Well you may have hid it from the rest of us here today.
[time=2972] You may have even kept it from your family, but there's that spot and beloved, that spot
[time=2978] is as glaring in the eye of God as the lasagna on my tie and you're not going to hide it.
[time=2989] Oh that our lives would resemble character.
[time=2992] And beloved did they, I want to stand here with transparency.
[time=2995] I haven't arrived.
[time=2996] Oh I have not arrived.
[time=3001] Yet the word of God would say that we're to live with character and purity of character that's marked by peacefulness, spotlessness, no point of blame.
[time=3012] It's interesting, the verse that follows.
[time=3017] Peter has just instructed us to have a heart, a peace, and spotlessness, and then he begins to say just as Paul wrote, I don't know if you know much about Paul and Peter.
[time=3027] There are only two times that I know of in the scriptures that they met.
[time=3031] And neither time was it a positive experience for Peter.
[time=3035] Peter shows up at the council of Jerusalem ready to defend the primacy of the Israeli
[time=3041] tradition in Christianity.
[time=3043] Paul stands up and says you're wrong.
[time=3049] Paul confronted Peter.
[time=3052] For a group of peers, leaders, he said Peter you're wrong.
[time=3058] He put Peter down.
[time=3062] Then there's another occasion in Galatians chapter 2.
[time=3065] Peter's kind of isolated himself over in this click.
[time=3071] Paul confronts Peter and says Peter, break away.
[time=3075] Get out of your collect.
[time=3078] And again Peter's corrected.
[time=3080] Now how would you describe someone who two times has publicly accused you and pointed
[time=3086] an indicting finger and said you're wrong?
[time=3088] How do you describe that person?
[time=3091] Can I tell you how Peter described Paul?
[time=3095] Verse 15, even as our beloved brother Paul, is that how you feel about someone who said
[time=3108] that you're wrong?
[time=3110] Is that how you feel about someone who in front of a whole group of people said no,
[time=3117] and one, our beloved brother Paul.
[time=3124] Oh, that there came to each of our lives that change of character.
[time=3128] That the impurity and steadfastness of integrity, that our hands and our lives were so shaped
[time=3134] that consistency marked them.
[time=3140] There was a man by the name of Dannek.
[time=3142] Dannek was a sculpture man.
[time=3144] He could sculpture anything.
[time=3147] He sculptured the goddess Adrian of the Greeks and it became the focal point of 17th century
[time=3154] Europe's eye and then he sat down to make a sculpturing of Christ.
[time=3163] Dannek said that I sculpt and I sculpt, but it never came till finally one day I was able
[time=3170] to sculpt the Christ.
[time=3174] It became the greatest of his works and he was commissioned by Napoleon to come and so
[time=3181] he came and stood before the general emperor.
[time=3184] Napoleon asked him to make for him to stand in the Louvre a sculpture of Venus and Dannek
[time=3192] said the hands that have sculptured the Christ can no more sculpture a pagan goddess.
[time=3199] All that our lives might say, the life that has had Christ at its center can no more
[time=3206] use it for anything other than his glory.
[time=3212] Final words, final instruction, be pure in character.
[time=3219] Secondly, he says in verses 16 and 17 that we be sound in doctrine, sound in doctrine.
[time=3229] He says some of the things that Paul said were kind of hard to understand.
[time=3233] I'd like to second that motion.
[time=3237] I'm not sure what the difference between predestination, ford, nation, election, the sovereignty of God and the free will of man have to do with infra-lapsarianism, sub-lapsarianism but they ask it on the test and I missed it.
[time=3249] It's hard to understand.
[time=3251] But you know, the mind of Christ can come into our heart and give us insight.
[time=3256] You know, today you may find the scriptures difficult to understand because you first of all have never received Christ as your Savior, never received him.
[time=3265] Then you'll not understand the scriptures because you have to have the Spirit of God in your heart to illuminate you.
[time=3272] Here he says, be sound in doctrine because someone's going to take one of those difficult passages and they're going to twist it and they're going to come out with some strange doctrine but they made sense out of taking this verse and that verse, putting them together and referencing the Old Testament and then they're going to take all these other verses that you thought made sense and make a different sense out of it.
[time=3291] Peter said, oh, be sound in doctrine.
[time=3294] You know, Paul said to the Church of Berea that they were more noble than the Church of Thessalonite because they searched the scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
[time=3303] Beloved, search the scriptures.
[time=3306] Don't just listen to me.
[time=3313] I'm just a person.
[time=3315] I don't have any great insight in the scriptures.
[time=3317] God doesn't speak to me any different than he speaks to you.
[time=3320] Oh, I have a little bit of education.
[time=3325] Maybe that gives me a little bit of insight but God's Spirit speaks and teaches you and you search the scriptures.
[time=3331] When you turn on your television, don't listen to it just because somebody on television said it.
[time=3337] Some of you sat at home today and watched a dozen religious broadcasts.
[time=3341] Love a discern the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=3346] You've got to have sound doctrine.
[time=3349] It's final word.
[time=3353] Be pure in character.
[time=3355] Be sound in doctrine.
[time=3357] Finally, be growing in Christ.
[time=3359] Verse 18, "But grow ye therefore in the grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[time=3368] Christ." I love that balance.
[time=3370] We're not only to grow in that which we understand, knowledge and truth.
[time=3374] But if truth comes into our life and it actually takes residence in our heart, it will also bring about a growth not just in knowledge but in graciousness.
[time=3383] You know, growth in Christ is too often measured in academics, how to be measured in grace.
[time=3390] Our ability to accept the undesirable.
[time=3393] Our ability to love the unlovely.
[time=3396] The ability to be winsome in the face of hostility.
[time=3399] The ability to say yes to someone who said no to you every time.
[time=3406] What would God say?
[time=3407] What are His final words?
[time=3411] Be pure in character.
[time=3413] Be sound in doctrine.
[time=3415] Be growing in Christ.
[time=3416] Let me put it to you as pointedly as I can.
[time=3420] Beloved, you will either grow in Christ or you will die.
[time=3430] Have you received Christ as Savior?
[time=3433] If not, would you receive Him today?
[time=3436] If you receive Christ as Savior, are you growing in Him?
[time=3439] I pray that you are.
[time=3441] The spirit of thankfulness has pervaded our program today.

[time=3478] Dear Heavenly Father, especially today we are thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ and the fact that you send Him to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3487] In today, Lord, I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3495] I ask you Jesus to come into my heart today, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
