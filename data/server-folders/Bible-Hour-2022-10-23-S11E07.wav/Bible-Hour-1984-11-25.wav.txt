[time=89] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=112] - Thank you, you made me seated.
[time=118] How great thou art.
[time=120] This morning we've come to worship and to praise our God together by lifting up our voices in song and by the devotion of our heart to say, "Oh God, we give thanks today." As a nation, we've set this weekend aside that we might give thanks unto God for what he has done in this land, in the blessings, the prosperity out of the tradition of the pilgrims who first settled this land with their Puritan background.
[time=144] They saw the value in working with them and giving thanks to God.
[time=148] This morning, as a church, as a congregation, we have much to be thankful for.
[time=153] God has truly been our strength and our help in ages past, but he is also our hope in years to come.
[time=160] Our choir sings as an anthem this morning, "Oh, God, our help in ages past." But we first want to welcome you and thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=170] You who've come today and other friends who join us by way of television, we trust today that you will develop a thankful heart, that each of us will find within us a spirit of appreciation, and we would sing within our own hearts, "Oh, God, our help in ages past." We praise him for who he is.
[time=189] Listen to our choir as they sing.
[time=204] [MUSIC] Oh, God, our help in ages past. [MUSIC] Our hope for years to come. [MUSIC] Our shelter from the stormy last. [MUSIC] And our return of all. [MUSIC]
[time=241] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=359] That help is built on the solidity. [MUSIC] It is built on the solid foundation of Jesus Christ. [MUSIC] Let's continue that theme as we sing the solid rock. [MUSIC] Him number 423. [MUSIC] We'll sing the first, third and fourths, [MUSIC] Stands us together. [MUSIC] Women's fields are nothing but else than Jesus far [MUSIC] and righteousness. [MUSIC] We are Christ the sweetest friend. [MUSIC] Our homie in all Jesus' name. [MUSIC] All. [MUSIC] Christ the star of your brother's name. [MUSIC] All. [MUSIC] All. [MUSIC] We sing the time. [MUSIC] All. [MUSIC] All. [MUSIC] Our homie in his name. [MUSIC] We sing the time. [MUSIC] We sing the time. [MUSIC] Oh, may I, may I be [MUSIC] In the harvest, in His righteousness [MUSIC] Love, lust, and be for a throne [MUSIC] All the Christ was solid [MUSIC] Rock, and stand [MUSIC] All of the crown, you sing and stand [MUSIC] All of the crown, you sing and stand [MUSIC] Christ made the mind in flesh to see [MUSIC] And brought redeeming the sight to me [MUSIC] He healed the aim and made them more [MUSIC] Praise His name, He saved my soul [MUSIC] I know not how He pierced the light [MUSIC] And brought to me the nation's sight [MUSIC] But this I know [MUSIC] Showed it in once I was blind [MUSIC] And now I see [MUSIC] In bound His love and sympathy [MUSIC] Christ stooped to heal and run someday [MUSIC] I can know His peace and power [MUSIC] He walks with me each day each hour [MUSIC] I know not how He pierced the light [MUSIC] And brought to me the nation's sight [MUSIC] But this I know [MUSIC] And showed it in once I was blind [MUSIC] And now I see [MUSIC]
[time=1055] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=1215] - Thank you, ladies, to remind us this morning in song,
[time=1225] that the very purpose of our lives is to praise Him.
[time=1228] So often, we lose perspective in life when we lose our sense of purpose.
[time=1233] If you ever even ask the philosophical question, why is it that we exist?
[time=1238] Why did God create us?
[time=1240] Very philosophical.
[time=1241] Who am I?
[time=1242] Why am I here?
[time=1243] Where am I going?
[time=1245] The book of Revelation says that all things exist for the praise of His glory, to give praise to His name.
[time=1252] Let us look to the Father in prayer.
[time=1254] Our God and our Father, we bow before you today through the songs that we have sung, through those that we have heard by way of ministry.
[time=1263] God, we've lifted you up.
[time=1265] We've praised the name of your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, because we love Him this morning, and we thank Him for the gift of eternal life.
[time=1273] And yet, God, today, we find within our own hearts a sense of fulfillment, that as we praise you, to our own being, there comes a sense of worth that life has value and purpose.
[time=1285] And so, God, today, it is even of selfishness that we've come to praise you, because it's in you that we discover life exists.
[time=1293] And yet, today, God, we've come to thank you.
[time=1296] We've come to thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave us eternal life by His own death.
[time=1301] We've come to thank you for your word that gives light unto our path and direction to our lives, that through its study, we have insight.
[time=1309] And in our lives, God, we thank you for your word.
[time=1312] God, we thank you for how you brought about physical recovery in many who have been ill.
[time=1317] And yet, God, we do ask you to continue to work in the lives of many today who are not well.
[time=1324] We pray for Judy Dabel, Pat McIntosh, for Mr. Eastis, for Mrs. Eichenauer.
[time=1332] God, we pray for the body of people who are hurting today, for those that fight cancer.
[time=1338] We pray that you would bring about a recovery in their body.
[time=1341] God, we would pray that you would strengthen families that wait, wondering.
[time=1347] We pray for those who walk with steps of uncertainty, that the one they love, they don't know what will ever happen.
[time=1355] God, we pray for those parents of teenagers who are walking in disobedience.
[time=1361] We pray that you would mend the broken heart of a parent and give direction to a young life.
[time=1366] God, we pray for a partner today who's feeling rejected for a parent who's parenting alone.
[time=1373] God, through your word, we would ask you to give strength.
[time=1376] But most of all, today, God, we would give you thanks in Jesus' name.
[time=1381] [AMEN]

[time=1572] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=1590] Thank you, Kevin. I trust this morning.
[time=1593] You've sensed that the hands of God are gentle as they guide and give direction to your life.
[time=1599] I believe that God does guide and give direction to life.
[time=1602] He does that through his word.
[time=1604] So this morning, we invite you to open your Bibles to study with us in the book of Philippians in the first chapter.
[time=1611] Have you ever made a discovery about yourself that you would really like to not have discovered?
[time=1619] Have you ever noticed that there's something about yourself that you really wish wasn't true?
[time=1625] I've made one of those discoveries this week.
[time=1628] Please don't guess at what it is.
[time=1630] You may reveal some other ones to me that I'd like not to have.
[time=1633] Revealed.
[time=1635] You know what I've noticed?
[time=1637] I've noticed this.
[time=1638] I'm not really a very thankful person.
[time=1641] I'm really a rather ungrateful person.
[time=1644] I look at Thanksgiving, for example.
[time=1646] You know, this day that we set aside for giving thanks?
[time=1650] You know what I set it aside for? Gluttony.
[time=1654] The day that we set aside to spend time with our family, you know what I do?
[time=1659] I get out of bed first and get my shotgun and go out shooting.
[time=1664] Really, it was a day that we said we're going to set this side.
[time=1667] A time was a nation.
[time=1668] And today, we're going to give thanks to God.
[time=1671] Someone says, you know, having service on Wednesday night before Thanksgiving isn't really such a good idea.
[time=1677] You know, it's kind of inconvenient for people.
[time=1679] You know, convenient for what?
[time=1682] Convenience is a matter of assisting you in achieving a given goal.
[time=1687] Well, my plan for Thanksgiving was to go home to Akron and go to my parents' house and eat.
[time=1694] Go to my wife's parents' house and eat.
[time=1697] Go to my sister's house and eat leftovers.
[time=1702] Isn't that what Thanksgiving is?
[time=1704] I'm afraid it is.
[time=1706] It's really not a time of giving thanks, is it?
[time=1709] It's really not a time that we set apart and we say this time of the year, this day, right here, maximum attention giving to God saying thank you.
[time=1719] It was a matter of fact, God's rather inconvenient in the whole scheme of Thanksgiving.
[time=1726] I'm not a very thankful person.
[time=1729] And yet, within me, there's a desire to want to be an appreciator.
[time=1733] Someone who's not characterized by ingratitude and unthankfulness.
[time=1738] How do you develop a thankful heart?
[time=1742] I've studied this week.
[time=1744] I've studied as much for me as I have for you.
[time=1748] And I don't want to accuse you of having all of my faults, just some of them.
[time=1753] Perhaps we can grow together today studying.
[time=1756] How do you develop a thankful heart?
[time=1758] Philippians 1, verse 3, Paul begins with these words.
[time=1763] I thank my God.
[time=1766] That grabbed my attention.
[time=1768] I thought, well, if Paul's got a thankful spirit, what was he thankful about?
[time=1772] How did he develop it?
[time=1774] Maybe I can learn some lessons, needed lessons, to be honest and painful lessons.
[time=1781] Developing a thankful heart.
[time=1783] I thank my God upon every remembrance of you.
[time=1788] Always in every prayer of mine making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel
[time=1797] from the first day, even until now.
[time=1801] Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you will perform
[time=1808] it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=1811] Even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart.
[time=1818] In so much as, both in my bonds and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel,
[time=1825] ye are partakers of my grace.
[time=1829] For God is my witness how greatly I long after you all in the tender mercies of Jesus Christ.
[time=1838] And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment.
[time=1849] That you may approve things that are excellent that you may be sincere without offense until
[time=1857] the day of Christ.
[time=1859] Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.
[time=1869] But I would, you should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have
[time=1877] fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=1882] So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places.
[time=1889] And many of the brethren in the Lord becoming confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak
[time=1895] the word without fear.
[time=1898] Some indeed preach Christ, even of envy and strife, and some of good will.
[time=1905] The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add to my affliction to my bonds.
[time=1913] But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel, what then, not withstanding,
[time=1920] every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached, and then that I do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
[time=1929] This passage teaches a variety of things.
[time=1933] The primary thing that it teaches is how Paul's attitude developed a thankful spirit.
[time=1940] Today I would like to pull out of Paul's own testimony here at least four things that have struck my heart
[time=1948] that will help us to develop a thankful heart.
[time=1952] First of all, Paul begins with this phrase, "I thank my God upon every remembrance."
[time=1959] Take note of that word, would you?
[time=1961] If you're an underliner, that might be a good thing to underline.
[time=1965] Remember, I believe the first step that we've got to take if we are going to develop a thankful heart
[time=1971] is we're going to have to take the step of developing a mind that remembers.
[time=1977] You know, I'm very, very rememberable.
[time=1982] I remember well hurts and pains.
[time=1987] But you know what? I forget how good a day yesterday was.
[time=1992] You know, I forget that it was November the 24th.
[time=1997] It's normally cold and snowy and blowy.
[time=2000] In Akron, Ohio was 56 degrees. I played golf. You're not supposed to do that in November.
[time=2007] Oh, I had one of the best times of my life, about the worst golf round of my life, but I had a good time.
[time=2014] You know, about two hours later, I was in the middle of driving home and three kids were making noise in the back seat, not joyful noise.
[time=2023] Somebody, and I am determined to find out which one of my sister-in-laws, bought my son a wind-up toy that has a drum to it.
[time=2033] Have you ever been in a car for four hours with a drum and a one-year-old?
[time=2038] You know, and I'm driving down that street and I say, "Oh, this is just the most miserable day of my life.
[time=2043] This is terrible." You know, it was just two hours earlier, standing on the golf course and saying, "This is great!" I forgot. You know, if we're ever going to have a grateful heart, we're going to have to develop a good memory, a mind that remembers.
[time=2059] Because we are so prone, aren't we? They're forgetting the blessings that have just fallen right on our laps, undeserved, unexpected.
[time=2066] We said, "Wow!" And ten minutes later, we're miserable. Poor memory. A poor memory.
[time=2076] You've got a hymnbook there. Open it up to hymn number 624. I'm not going to lead us in singing this morning.
[time=2083] See, there's an occasion for Thanksgiving in itself.
[time=2086] But hymn 624. You know what? We teach this to our children. We ought to teach it to ourselves.
[time=2093] We think of it as a children song, but it's really not. It's theology is too deep for children.
[time=2099] It's insights too practical to let go to four-year-olds. It begins with a question.
[time=2106] Are you feeling tossed in the tempest and the storms of life? Are you ever feeling discouraged?
[time=2113] Do you ever feel like everything in life is lost?
[time=2118] What should you do? In a word? Remember.
[time=2123] Remember what God has done. Count your many blessings. See what God has done. Count your many blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2133] You know, if we were to do that, our whole perspective and life will change, our heart will be lightened, our step will be brisker, our enthusiasm will be deeper.
[time=2142] If we would simply remember a mind that remembers. You know, as a church, we have so much to remember, so much to remember, and to be thankful for.
[time=2159] You know, last Sunday, a young lady came forward. I said, "Why have you come?" She said, "I want to receive Jesus as my Savior."
[time=2168] You know, we need to thank God for that. All of heaven opened up according to 1 Peter, the angel sang and rejoiced, and we hurried home to get the roast out of the oven.
[time=2180] You need to remember what God has done. Do you know that a few weeks before that, a family came forward and said, "We received Christ years ago, but we've never walked in obedience."
[time=2189] And they said, "We've come to give our hearts a fresh to Christ." You know, a couple this morning came, and they said, "We've come to recommit our heart to Christ. We need to remember that."
[time=2201] Do you know that in evangelism this semester, there have been many people, one to Christ? There have been others who've come to this service and made that faith public?
[time=2209] Do you know, there are dozens and dozens, probably a hundred people, who said, "Yes, I want to be a partner in the ministry with this church this year alone."
[time=2217] You need to remember. I'm not very good at that.
[time=2223] You know that God has blessed this church with servants.
[time=2227] I mean, people who make their life's work serving the Lord Jesus Christ, and they do it here.
[time=2237] This morning I looked down in the first service, and there was a couple there. This couple I haven't seen in church in years, in years.
[time=2250] You know why that is? It's not because they have poor church attendance. They've just said, "We'll take those toddler ones."
[time=2258] Do you know what a toddler one is? A toddler one in our church is somebody who's about a year and a half to two and a half years old.
[time=2266] They're at the age where they can almost walk, they can almost talk, and they're almost potty trained.
[time=2274] And mommy drops them off in their almost potty trained condition without a diaper, and they were almost potty trained.
[time=2283] What a joy. You know what? They've done that for years in this church, two hours, both worship services.
[time=2292] They've taken my kids. I'm thankful for people like that.
[time=2298] I'm thankful for a Jeff Vaughn who is doing a job that I don't think I could handle.
[time=2304] I mean, if it was my paid salary job, that's a tough one.
[time=2310] You know, I've never met him that he wasn't encouraging me.
[time=2314] There's a whole tribe of people working with him in Sunday school.
[time=2319] You know that there's a couple in our church who got married two days before the living Christmas tree started about four or five years ago.
[time=2328] They were just so thankful that God had rebuilt their lives.
[time=2332] That they canceled their honeymoon and came and helped build the living Christmas tree.
[time=2336] You know what they've done every year for an anniversary to celebrate?
[time=2340] They've coordinated the distribution of 20,000 living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=2345] Well, I'm thankful for servants, aren't you? I'm thankful for a board of deacons who are busy men whose lives are full, whose wives are full and busy.
[time=2355] There's a couple. They labor in a flock ministry. They spend long meetings handling decisions trying to give direction to a board.
[time=2363] You know what I'm thankful for though? The most, those quiet people.
[time=2367] You know, this church is full of people who just quietly unnoticed, unseen, sneak in, work hard, and go home.
[time=2377] And only God knows the value of their labor because we've missed it. I've missed it.
[time=2383] You know, we need to remember the blessings that we have of servants within this body who make the ministry function.
[time=2391] We need to remember what God's done financially. Oh, we face days ahead that aren't necessarily easy days.
[time=2397] You know, it was only three years ago that we sat on a mountain of bills. Red ink was coloring everything.
[time=2404] Yet God took those bills and then all most six months time took them all away.
[time=2410] A quarter of a million dollars took them all away.
[time=2413] You know, this ministry today stands strong and free because God's blessed it in some extraordinary ways.
[time=2420] You know, whenever we get discouraged, it's good to remember, isn't it?
[time=2425] It's good just to stop and say, "Well, yeah, there's that mountain ahead." But it's so healthy to turn around and to look and see what's behind and to see what's behind.
[time=2437] Remember, if we're ever going to develop a thankful heart, it's going to begin with a mind that remembers.
[time=2443] Secondly, I think what Paul says to me here at least is that we're going to have to have with a mind
[time=2449] that remembers a spirit of appreciation.
[time=2452] He says, "I thank God on every remembrance of you for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day even until now."
[time=2460] That word fellowship actually describes a partnership.
[time=2464] It comes up again in verse seven as a concept. He says, "You are my fellow partakers of the grace of God."
[time=2472] Paul said, "I appreciate you." Paul said, "I was remembering you and my heart and my spirit would just overcome with appreciation."
[time=2481] Paul said, "You've been partners with me not only today, but from the first day, even though now Paul said, "I've always been able to count on you." Boy, I appreciate that.
[time=2494] You know, it is so difficult for most of us to express our appreciation.
[time=2499] And our ingratitude is about to cut us off from everyone else in life.
[time=2507] This past week, we've had two requests for assistance.
[time=2512] One family requested assistance. When that assistance was met, there was just an unbelievable spirit of appreciation and thankfulness.
[time=2522] You know what that did? It made us scratch our head and say, "Maybe there's a way we can do more."
[time=2529] Another one asked for assistance. We weren't even from this church.
[time=2535] People we'd never known, never seen, never heard of, they called and they asked for assistance.
[time=2539] We were able to help. We thank God for that privilege.
[time=2543] As we help the individual, they said, "Well, I've got another problem here." I said, "We can't help with that problem." Why not? Why don't you?
[time=2554] They didn't even appreciate what was being done, only a demand for more.
[time=2560] That is so characteristic of me.
[time=2565] Whatever I get was good, but I'd sure like a little bit more.
[time=2572] If we're ever going to find fulfillment in life, if we're ever going to develop a grateful heart, it's going to come when we not only remember, but we develop a spirit of appreciation for what we have.
[time=2584] The very popular Bible commentary, Matthew Henry, was robbed one day.
[time=2589] And after being robbed, he stopped and gave thanks.
[time=2594] He was just robbed and now he's giving thanks and he thanked God for four things.
[time=2598] First of all, he thanked God that he had never been robbed before.
[time=2603] Did he ever do that? Something bad happens in life. Did he ever stop and say, "God thanks." That it didn't happen before.
[time=2610] He said, "Secondly, I thank God, even though I was robbed, I didn't have much on me."
[time=2618] I mean, that's being practical, isn't it?
[time=2621] He could have had his life savings in his back pocket. He didn't have much on him that day.
[time=2625] He said, "Thirdly, I just had to stop and thank God that although my money was taken, my life was not."
[time=2632] He said, "Most of all, I had to thank God that I was robbed and not the one doing the robbing."
[time=2640] You know what, when we have that spirit of appreciation, there comes within our heart
[time=2647] a joy and a fulfillment in life that we'll never discover by knowing abundance.
[time=2653] We'll never know it through abundance.
[time=2659] We need to have spirit of appreciation. I need it.
[time=2664] Then Paul speaks in a whole new dimension, a different direction.
[time=2670] Verse 12, he adds another concept.
[time=2675] On top of a mind that remembers, in a spirit of appreciation, he says, "Now there must be an attitude of acceptance, acceptance of the difficult things."
[time=2687] Paul had a master plan for his life.
[time=2690] His master plan was to continue on his missionary journeys, going from city to city, proclaiming Christ, establishing churches, corresponding through letters, training young men to give leadership into those existing churches and ultimately work his way through the known Mediterranean world and end up in Rome standing in the capital of the empire, proclaiming Christ from the pinnacles.
[time=2713] That was his plan. You know what happened?
[time=2717] He went back to Jerusalem and he was arrested.
[time=2720] And he went from one kangaroo court to another.
[time=2725] And he finally appealed the Caesar.
[time=2728] And instead of taking a trip to Rome as the preacher, he won as the prisoner.
[time=2734] Instead of going with Timothy on this side and John Mark on this side and a whole entourage of workers ready to assist behind him, instead of setting up meetings in the marketplace, he went with a Roman soldier on each side.
[time=2752] He didn't go to the marketplace. He went to prison.
[time=2756] Don't misunderstand when he says in the palace.
[time=2760] That's a mistranslation. It's the word "pritorium," which is, yes, the home of a high official, but it's also a dungeon prison as well.
[time=2771] He wasn't received as an ambassador. He wasn't royalty visiting from a far country.
[time=2776] He was a prisoner. He was a prisoner in chains.
[time=2780] And he was a prisoner in chains on death row.
[time=2784] Because the Caesar refused to hear his case or heard it and ruled against him, he would die.
[time=2791] And history records, that's exactly what happened.
[time=2795] Into this great career is thrust.
[time=2802] The chains of failure, gripping him, holding him down, and Paul writes,
[time=2811] "I want you to understand something that what has happened to me has rather fallen out to the furtherance of the gospel." You know what he's saying there?
[time=2822] He's saying, "All of this that happened to me, all these things that went wrong, this trip that was marked by shipwrecked, these chains, these Roman soldiers,
[time=2833] all of this that has looked like it's been a defeat." He said, "I gladly accepted." "I gladly accepted because God is using this and I'll accept it."
[time=2847] You know, we'll never be thankful until we're willing to accept the trials and the difficulties that God puts in our lives.
[time=2857] I want to say first of all that I know that some of you are going through some trials that no one else can even begin to understand.
[time=2865] People may know about it, they may see it, they may care, but they really don't know how deep your hurt is.
[time=2872] And I'm not going to be pretending today that I understand and that I think it's easy.
[time=2879] But yet, it's not till we come to the point that we accept what God has put in our hand that they'll ever come fulfillment to our life.
[time=2889] A few weeks ago, Johnny Erickson Todda came to our community, had a tremendous ministry of encouragement.
[time=2896] The first day she was here, there was a lunch for pastors.
[time=2900] There were about 160 pastors that came to hear from a young woman, a testimony of how God can rebuild a broken life.
[time=2908] I had the privilege of sitting next to her at dinner.
[time=2911] I saw these hands that were turned in with atrophy and supported by braces
[time=2917] so they just wouldn't flop.
[time=2919] The braces had a metal strip in them so a spoon could be tucked in and shoulder muscles could be used like this to feed herself just a little.
[time=2927] As I sat next to her, I said, "Could I help?" And she said, "Oh, I would appreciate that.
[time=2932] Would you butter my bread?" A few minutes later, "Could you turn my plate so the beans are at about 12 o'clock?"
[time=2941] "I'm embarrassed to say this," she said, "but my nose is running.
[time=2946] Could you wipe it with a napkin?" Then I watched four men pick her up in a wheelchair and sat her on a platform.
[time=2955] This woman who had to say, "Turn my plate.
[time=2957] Please butter my bread." Did you wipe my nose?
[time=2963] He said, "What a privilege it is for me today to come and to share Christ with you.
[time=2969] For you see what you know is a disability God has turned into my ability.
[time=2975] And I thank him for it." Can you believe that?
[time=2979] Can you believe a 17-year-old could have a neck broken and never walk again, never had the joy of holding another person's hand and feeling that hand there?
[time=2989] Say, "I thank God because my disability has become my ability." Because Corinthian says that he doesn't take the strong and the noble but he takes the weak and the broken and God broke me that he can use me and I thank him for it.
[time=3007] Beloved, it's not till we come to that place of acceptance.
[time=3012] The acceptance of our herds, the acceptance of the death of our loved one, the acceptance of a broken relationship, the acceptance of a rebellious teenager that our life will ever be fulfilled.
[time=3024] And if you don't accept it, I can tell you what will happen.
[time=3028] You'll grow old and you'll grow bitter and your bitterness will not only snuff out the joy of your life
[time=3037] but is a deadly contagious disease that will afflict everyone that comes close to you.
[time=3045] Paul said death row, prison, chains, I accept it.
[time=3053] I don't want it, I don't like it but I accept it.
[time=3059] I accept it.
[time=3062] If there's ever going to come fulfillment to our lives and a heart of thankfulness, we're going to have to have a mind that remembers a spirit that appreciates
[time=3073] and an attitude of acceptance.
[time=3076] And then finally, I believe we'll have to have eyes of contentment, eyes of contentment.
[time=3084] Paul then says, now here I'm in prison and there's a whole group of people out there.
[time=3090] They're all preaching Christ. This one's preaching Christ because he loves the Lord and I thank God for that.
[time=3095] You know what that guy's doing? He's preaching about Christ.
[time=3098] You know why he's doing it? He's doing it because I'm in prison and he thinks that it's going to get to me that he's taking my place.
[time=3105] He thinks that because he's building a bigger church than my church, that it's going to hurt me, he's simply doing it out of strife, he's just doing it out of contention.
[time=3113] You know, Paul said, so what?
[time=3117] Notwithstanding.
[time=3120] Either way, no matter why, whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached,
[time=3126] and I'm content.
[time=3129] This is the same man who in a few chapters will say, I know how to abound.
[time=3133] He said, I know how to live good and I sure know how to enjoy it when the good times are in.
[time=3137] He says, you know what? I've also learned how to live abased.
[time=3141] He said, I know how to suffer want.
[time=3145] He said, in whatever state I'm in therein, I've learned to be content.
[time=3151] Beloved, if you don't learn contentment today, you will never learn it. You will never learn it.
[time=3157] Because if you're not content with what you have, you'll never find contentment.
[time=3163] There's an Eastern story of a man who was king and who had a disease.
[time=3171] And he was told that the only cure for his disease was to wear the shirt of a contented man.
[time=3179] And so he sent out his emissaries into his kingdom and they went throughout his kingdom searching for a contented man.
[time=3186] And after many months they found no one contented and finally one of his emissaries came back and he said,
[time=3192] oh king, I have found a contented man. And the king said, give me his shirt that I might be well.
[time=3200] The man said, sir, he had no shirt. He had no shirt.
[time=3208] You see, if we don't find contentment with what we possess, we'll never find it.
[time=3214] Here is the man in the kingdom who had the least, but he was the most contented.
[time=3221] Happiness is not found in that which we possess. It's found within us. It's found within us.
[time=3230] And so many of us are literally wearing our lives to the bone, trying to gain more, thinking with that acquisition,
[time=3238] with that achievement, with this goal, with this acquisition, then I'll find fulfillment.
[time=3245] And it never comes. Pyress was by language of the Romans of barbarian.
[time=3252] He was attacking the city. In his second, Cenia said to him, Pyress, what will you do when Rome falls?
[time=3258] He said, then I'll march south and I'll take Sicily. Won't that be a grand possession?
[time=3263] Cenia said, then what will you do? He said, then we'll cross the sea and we'll take Carthage.
[time=3269] Then what will you do? Then we'll go back to the land of Alexander and we'll conquer Greece.
[time=3276] Cenia said, then what will you do? He said, then I think I'll sit down and I will enjoy.
[time=3284] Cenia said, sir, why not do that now? Why not do that now?
[time=3292] There's always one more thing that we want. Isn't there? There's always one more thing.
[time=3299] A year ago, we thought if we could just be a two-car family, oh, if we could just be a two-car family,
[time=3306] we just wouldn't have any problems. We're a two-car family. No, we say no.
[time=3311] Now, if we just kept the station wagon, instead of having these two cars, if we just had one car in a station wagon, I was with a relative who had a station wagon. You know what they said? If we just had a van.
[time=3322] You know what the people who have vans do? They fly everywhere on an airplane.
[time=3329] It's never enough. It's not for me. It's not for most of you.
[time=3336] If we're ever going to develop a thankful heart, it's going to have to begin with eyes of contentment.
[time=3343] There's always somebody who's got more. We've got to learn to say what the apostle Paul said.
[time=3350] So what? So what? Not withstanding. I don't care whether this one's preaching Christ because he loves the Lord,
[time=3357] and this one's doing because he thinks he's making me miserable. So what? I'm content.
[time=3362] He said, I'll just sit here in death row, and I'm fine. I'm thankful.
[time=3369] Here sits a man alone waiting for the sentence of death, and he says, I thank my God.
[time=3378] Can you say that today?
[time=3380] You know, it's difficult to say thank you to God because in saying thank you to someone, that means that they helped us.
[time=3387] And I want to say this is my mountain. I climbed it all by myself, and I built everything on my mountain, and I did it, and I didn't need you.
[time=3396] Whenever I say thank you, I'm acknowledging that I didn't do it. It's not even my mountain.
[time=3402] We need to learn to say thank you and thank you to God because you see, there's a mountain.
[time=3409] Mount Zion, the city of God, the place of eternal life, and you can't climb that mountain, and you can't own that.
[time=3416] It can only be given to you. It can only be given to you by the Lord Jesus Christ who died for your sins.
[time=3421] And the only way you can say thank you to him is to receive him. Would you receive him today? I pray that you will.
[time=3428] You've been listening to our pastor, Rick Hawk, speak from the Word of God.

[time=3459] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son to die on the cross because you love the world so much.
[time=3467] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me from my sin and to forgive me.
[time=3473] Dear Lord, I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
