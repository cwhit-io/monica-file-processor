[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=60] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=64] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=72] With inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hopps.
[time=82] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=85] (singing in foreign language) First four, when Christ shall come,
[time=95] we shall go back, away shall, and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
[time=104] When I shall come, in our whole application, and in our own way, my God, I'll bring the hope.
[time=117] When since my soul, I say to God to thee,
[time=123] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[time=130] When since my soul, I say to God to thee,
[time=138] I'll bring the hope, I'll bring the hope.
[time=143] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=155] We want to welcome you to our second morning worship service
[time=161] here today, and also say a word of welcome to our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=168] As we've assembled this morning, there are a number of reasons why we've come.
[time=172] We've come the fellowship together to be encouraged, to share the Lord Jesus Christ, but the greatest purpose for which we've assembled is to worship and to praise His name.
[time=183] Did you ever wish that there was just more ability within you to praise God, to sing of His wonders, to give glory to His name?
[time=190] Do you just wish you could do it two times over, three times over, perhaps a thousand times over?
[time=196] That must have been the thought of Charles Wesley when he wrote, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, "my great Redeemer's praise, "the glories of my God and King, "the triumphs of His name, "the sworn we've come as over a thousand voices "to bring praise to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." I trust in your heart that you're worshiping them this morning.
[time=217] We have a privilege today of listening, of singing, to music, and then to study God's word.
[time=223] We're glad that you've come.
[time=224] Listen to our choirs they sing.
[time=226] Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing.
[time=229] (gentle piano music)
[time=237] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=390] (bell ringing) - Let us come Christians continuing to rejoice
[time=400] and praise our heavenly Father.
[time=402] Him number 90, come Christians joined to sing, Him number 90.
[time=406] [MUSIC]
[time=417] (singing in foreign language)
[time=477] [MUSIC - 36 seconds]
[time=516] - Thank you for your good singing.
[time=524] What a joy it is to know that as we leave this earth, our singing here is but a beginning of the glorious bliss that we'll experience as we sing together in heaven.
[time=535] I'll be grateful too because there'll be no extra rehearsals.
[time=538] We'll just know all of the music, all of the notes will come out beautifully and we'll just praise Him together.
[time=545] Well, let's continue worshiping the Lord through music as Dave and Debbie Johnson play for us on the stringed instruments, praising again Jesus, the Jesus that was born 2,000 years ago.
[time=558] (gentle music)
[time=588] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=728] Again, we wish to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=731] Right now, while the offering and announcements are being made here in our church, I want to slip away and talk directly with you friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=740] We're right in the front days of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=743] Yesterday was the beginning of a lot of activity here for the Living Christmas Tree, and it'll be that way every day, I think, from now until December 13th.
[time=753] Yesterday was the day you got all the sound equipment and everything put into shape.
[time=758] Yes, we added some things to our equipment, and it helps in our regular services, too, improve the quality of our reproduction, of our sound, our music, and the preaching.
[time=767] Oh, good, good, good, thank you then.
[time=769] Well, we're really excited.
[time=771] Yesterday was December 1st, and as of yesterday, the tickets for all of the concerts are gone, except for the last concert, which is when?
[time=779] December 23rd, Rick.
[time=781] That's a Sunday evening at 8 p.m.
[time=783] That's the last concert we have.
[time=785] I think it's going to be one of the greatest, and we encourage you to write to the Black Hawk Baptist Church or call us at 749-8524 and reserve your tickets.
[time=797] There are several available, but that's the only concert out of the 15 that we have tickets for.
[time=803] You know, that's exciting to be able to say, though, that there's still a chance for you to come, and particularly for the last concert because that is somewhat of the high point of the whole affair for us, because we don't get tired doing it 15 times.
[time=816] It's each time builds excitement upon excitement, and there's literally some tearful eyes here at the thought that it's all over, and that's the great crescendo.
[time=825] So if you have never come to the Living Christmas tree, or if you haven't, you just haven't gotten your tickets for this year, don't miss out on the Sunday 8 o'clock concert on December 23rd.
[time=836] We'd love to have you, and just write to us or call the number Pete gave you, 749-8524, and we'll have a place for you.
[time=844] Pete, I hope that you get plenty of rest and everything falls into place for you.
[time=849] This is a very busy time for you.
[time=851] Well, we have to thank all of the volunteer people that are in charge of various committees, because they're just doing a super job, and we couldn't do it without all of our own people helping out.
[time=861] Well, there is a great group of people here who serve, and the by-wall or crew is one of the best.
[time=867] The men and women that come here early and set up equipment and run cameras and sound and lighting and engineer and produce, we are so thankful for all those of lay people who make it happen.
[time=878] They really come very early.
[time=879] We're watching this in the near noon time, but they're here about 7 o'clock in the morning if not before getting everything ready, and that's great, we appreciate that.
[time=888] We sure do.
[time=889] As we come to the Christmas time, it's also a reminder that we're coming to the end of the year.
[time=895] The end of the year, December leads us to a brand new year, and often we make New Year's resolutions, our promises to ourself, our set new goals and priorities, and we want to suggest to you one of the best goals, the best resolutions you could make, would be to have a daily study of God's Word.
[time=913] Too many people are waiting on Sunday to be spoon fed by their pastor.
[time=918] You need to be studying God's Word on your own.
[time=920] Jesus said, "Search the Scriptures." And we want to help you in that search by supplying you with this helpful tool titled "Timeless Insights." Timeless Insights is a daily devotional tool that will take you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=937] Beginning in January, we'll start with the Gospel of John, and we'll study John for one month, and then we'll go month by month through the entire New Testament till we come all the way back to Luke next December.
[time=950] Inside Timeless Insights, there are three sections.
[time=953] After you read the Scripture, the first section is a Timeless Insight.
[time=957] Some of the great writers about the Bible help us to understand the passage.
[time=961] People like Martin Luther, or Matthew Henry, or John Calvin are all in here giving their insight into a passage.
[time=968] Then secondly, there's a timely response.
[time=971] A way for you and I to apply God's Word to our life today.
[time=975] And then finally, some timely related passages.
[time=978] We may have been studying John, but maybe Mark gives us another insight.
[time=982] At the bottom of the page, direct your attention to other Scriptures you can read.
[time=986] We want to send this to you now in December so that you can begin in January to read with us.
[time=992] It's free, it's a gift from us to you.
[time=995] Allow it to be a Christmas gift, if you will, and we want you to have it if you'll simply write to us.
[time=1000] Pete, would you tell them how to get their copy?
[time=1002] You can receive Timeless Insights by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1012] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1019] Pete, I do want to clarify one thing we said.
[time=1022] We said there are tickets available only for one concert.
[time=1025] That's only partially true.
[time=1027] We have a premier dinner concert, which is a fundraising benefit concert for black heart Christian school.
[time=1033] Some of you may be interested in that, and we would love to have you come.
[time=1037] If you would like information as to the cost and how to make arrangements, please call us.
[time=1045] The benefit concert is on Thursday night, December the 13th, and if you'll call us, we'll be glad to give you that information.
[time=1051] Again, our number is 749-8524.
[time=1055] 749-8524.
[time=1058] Pete, we're ready to go back to the Morning Worship Service and hear from one of our newest groups.
[time=1063] Sound Foundation will be singing a song entitled, "I Will Bless the Lord." Well, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1070] I always appreciate and enjoy the music, and so many of our viewers who write in, tell us that the music is a real encouragement to their lives.
[time=1078] Stay with us now.
[time=1080] [MUSIC] I will bless the Lord [MUSIC] Give, give [MUSIC] Glory, oh, why [MUSIC] Will bless his name [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory, I will [MUSIC] Bless the Lord [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory, oh, why [MUSIC] Will bless his name [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory [MUSIC] The Lord is gracious and merciful [MUSIC] And great in kindness [MUSIC] And good to all [MUSIC] The Lord is righteous [MUSIC] And all is sweet [MUSIC] Bless the Lord [MUSIC] And give him praise [MUSIC] I will bless the Lord [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory, oh, why [MUSIC] Will bless his name [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory [MUSIC] He's near to all who will call on him [MUSIC] And loves the righteous [MUSIC] Who fear his name [MUSIC] You ring forever as Lord and King [MUSIC] Live your voice with praise and sing [MUSIC] I will bless the Lord [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory, oh, why [MUSIC] Will bless his name [MUSIC] And give, give [MUSIC] Glory, give him [MUSIC] Glory, give him [MUSIC] Glory, give him [MUSIC] Glory, give him [MUSIC] Glory, give him ♪
[time=1313] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1316] - Give him glory.
[time=1321] The very purpose of our lives is to do that very thing.
[time=1325] Whether it be in song, by the character we demonstrate in our role as parents, whether by the work that we do on a job and everything, to give glory to God.
[time=1339] Today is Ruth Yolcom's last day with us.
[time=1343] She has found the very plan of her life to give glory to God would be to take her nursing skills around the world to Christian Memorial Hospital in Bangladesh.
[time=1355] And so, after the services this morning, she'll be traveling to her parents' home to make her last stop.
[time=1361] And then, just after Christmas, she'll be heading literally halfway around the world.
[time=1367] We are so thankful that God has raised up a Ruth Yolcom out of our church and a Mary Cruz and a Mike and a Carolyn Ballist and a Bill and a Joanne Servall and a Denny and Debbie Howard.
[time=1379] Men and women who say, "I'll go where God wants me to go." But yet, in the same spirit, many of you are saying, "I'm here today because this is how God wants my life to glorify him." I'm in a career, and I believe this is the best way that I can penetrate this community for Christ.
[time=1395] We thank God for men and women who say, "My purpose in life is to glorify him." Our Father today, we ask of you to bless and to guide Ruth Yolcom,
[time=1407] that as she would go as a nurse, that she would go also as an ambassador for Christ, that your spirit would guide her and your hand would keep her.
[time=1416] Father, we thank you for her courageousness and for her character and pray that you might bless her.
[time=1422] God, we pray for this body of people, that while she is gone, we may continue to grow in our unity of body and our love one for another and our obedience to you and our growth in evangelism.
[time=1436] God, we ask your blessing on this congregation as well as Ruth's life.
[time=1441] Father, we would pray today that your spirit would come upon our hearts and strengthen us, that in the admonition of your Word, we might find life, that in your Word, we might find, as David said, a sweetness that satisfies the needs of our heart, and particularly, we pray for Pat McIntosh, Judy Dable.
[time=1464] We pray for those within our church who have loved ones in the hospital.
[time=1468] We pray for Joyce Smith and for Anna Godfrey.
[time=1471] God, today, we pray for parents who've lost children in recent months and years.
[time=1476] We pray for those who've lost spouses and who parent alone are those who in the senior years of their life today find loneliness, their only companion.
[time=1487] God, today, there are many who feel within their heart that it's reigning on the inside.
[time=1493] Oh, God, in the clouds and in the tempest and in the storms, may they find a God who cares.
[time=1499] And although it's reigning on the inside, may they find Jesus Christ's voice encouraging them for it's in His name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1510] [MUSIC]
[time=1523] When all goodbyes are said and done,
[time=1530] and nighttime finds you home,
[time=1538] are you all right to spend the night of being all alone?
[time=1552] Or do you hide between the lines of conversation's past?
[time=1565] A wall of words, a heart unheard that hides behind a mess?
[time=1579] I'm reigning on the inside.
[time=1585] My heart wells up with tears that start to pour.
[time=1592] I'm reigning on the inside,
[time=1598] but then your cries of love break through, and I fall in love with you once more.
[time=1609] [MUSIC]
[time=1612] When friends who care can't be there to ease away my pain.
[time=1625] And peace of mind, it's hard to find like sunlight in the rain.
[time=1638] God sees my heart the deepest part inside this lonely knee.
[time=1651] And reaching in His love begins to heal this heart in me.
[time=1664] I'm reigning on the inside.
[time=1670] My heart wells up with tears that start to pour.
[time=1676] I'm reigning on the inside,
[time=1682] but then your cries of love break through, and I fall in love with you once more.
[time=1694] [MUSIC]
[time=1698] Sometimes we're reigning on the inside.
[time=1705] Oh, our hearts well up with tears that start to pour.
[time=1711] But when we're reigning on the inside,
[time=1718] let his cries of love break through, know that he loves you once more.
[time=1730] [MUSIC]
[time=1736] So if you're reigning on the inside,
[time=1743] let his cries of love break through, know that he loves you once more.
[time=1755] [MUSIC]
[time=1776] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1782] There's a beauty in a song not only in its melody and its intonation,
[time=1789] but it's in its message.
[time=1792] Each of us know what it's like to be reigning on the inside.
[time=1799] Many of us today feel a great thunderstorm within.
[time=1804] The clouds have burst.
[time=1806] They've poured forth their waters profusely, from the joy in our hearts.
[time=1812] We put on our best suit, our newest dress.
[time=1817] We put on our Sunday morning smile, our proverbial, "I'm fine, how are you?" But if the hearts were open today, it's raining on the inside.
[time=1829] Many of you today know what it's like to have walked on mountaintops,
[time=1835] and yet today you're in a valley.
[time=1838] At the top and see the sunshine, you only know the rain.
[time=1841] Some of you, I should say some of us, are even a little bit disillusioned in our Christian life, because someone came along and they took this track out of their pocket and said, "Here, law one, God loves you, and he's got a wonderful plan for your life." And never did they say it's going to rain.
[time=1863] You went to church one Sunday morning and they were singing joy, joy.
[time=1867] There is joy in serving Jesus.
[time=1871] And you thought, if I just gave my heart to Christ, then the rain would stop.
[time=1877] Many of us came to Christ as the culmination of a search for happiness.
[time=1883] And how does happiness and rain and Christ all fit together?
[time=1892] The greatest message by far that was ever preached was preached on the lonely hillside, a mount, and received the descriptive title, "The Sermon on the Mount." It's rather interesting that Jesus began that message with several statements about happiness and how to find them.
[time=1912] And he ended that sermon with the observation that if you come to him,
[time=1918] you're still going to face rain.
[time=1921] The Sermon on the Mount begins with the Beatitudes, "Blessed are those," and then the description follows.
[time=1927] That word "blessed" comes to us in English from a German and a Latin stem Beatus, which means "to be happy." That's also the meaning of the original Greek word in the Greek New Testament.
[time=1938] J.B. Phillips, when he did his paraphrase of the Beatitudes, said, "Happy are those." So also, today's English version translates our word "blessed" for "happy" and it's an accurate translation.
[time=1950] Jesus began with several statements about happiness.
[time=1954] The Sermon on the Mount is actually, in some ways, what Jesus had to say about happiness and how to find it.
[time=1961] Yet that same sermon ends with this illustration, "Wise men build us house upon the rock," the foolish man build us house upon the sand, and both lives were hit with the storms of life.
[time=1978] Coming to Christ indeed is an avenue to happiness, but it is not an escape from the trials, the testings, and the tempests of life.
[time=1990] If you have your Bible with you this morning, we invite you to study along with us in Matthew 5 chapter.
[time=1996] Matthew 5, 6, and 7 represent Matthew's account, the fullest of all the gospels, of the famous Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2006] In the next few months, we'll be studying Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2014] We're titling it, "What Jesus Said About," and we'll be able to study what Jesus said about happiness, what Jesus said about anger, what Jesus said about forgiveness, what did Jesus say about divorce, what did Jesus say about hypocrisy, what did Jesus say about prayer, what did Jesus say about morality, what did Jesus say about trials?
[time=2036] We'll study those in the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2039] Today we're beginning by studying what did Jesus say about happiness, a look at the first four Beatitudes, Matthew 5 verse 1.
[time=2049] And seeing the multitudes, he went up unto a mountain, and when he was seated, his disciples came unto him.
[time=2059] And he opened his mouth and he taught them, saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2073] Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[time=2082] Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
[time=2088] Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[time=2097] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[time=2103] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[time=2108] Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2115] Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my name's sake.
[time=2123] Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.
[time=2133] The Beatitudes are actually a lesson in what Jesus had to say about happiness.
[time=2139] Just before we look at today's study, let me make a few general observations about the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2147] Jesus has gone through the ordeal of being tempted and tried by Satan.
[time=2153] He's now opened up his public ministry.
[time=2156] He's began to call his disciples.
[time=2158] He's began to draw a crowd and it's time to get away from it all.
[time=2162] It's time for a retreat, a getaway weekend, an escape.
[time=2167] So he goes up onto a mountain and his disciples, his closest friends, follow him.
[time=2172] If you will, this was the first Christian retreat, a time to get away from it all.
[time=2178] It's amazing how we change our perspective and our values and our thoughts when we do that, when we find a way to get away from it all.
[time=2188] It's always interesting if you can take a teenager and get them to a Christian camp away from asphalt, radio and television, how you can really change some thoughts, you can really penetrate a heart.
[time=2201] It's amazing how many of us tied up in the business world, if we can just get away for a weekend and unplug the telephone, unplug the children, and mother goes, "Ahh." How we can begin to zero in on some issues of life that get clouded in the confusion.
[time=2224] Jesus got his disciples up there to get them away from it all, so they wouldn't be pressed with where's dinner going to come from and who's going to feed this multitude and what's the agenda for tomorrow?
[time=2236] They could just zero in on the basics of life.
[time=2240] You know, I like to get away from it all.
[time=2243] We have some friends who have a cottage and we go up there with them often.
[time=2248] One day it was windy and it was just so great to be out where you could hear the wind blow.
[time=2254] You ever tried to hear the wind blow and you can't hear it over the television set, over the radio, over the kids' next door?
[time=2261] We thought it was going to be so great to live on a park and it is wonderful.
[time=2265] We didn't realize that teenagers came there every day with their radios and stayed for the day.
[time=2271] Can't quite hear that wind blowing.
[time=2273] We went up to a friend's cottage.
[time=2275] Storm was coming but wasn't going to be there for a while but the wind was blowing, you know how that is.
[time=2280] I can remember as a little boy climbing a tree.
[time=2283] You know what I did?
[time=2284] I climbed the biggest tree I could find and sat in the top.
[time=2286] It felt the wind blow.
[time=2288] It's amazing what you think about them in the top of a tree that you don't think of behind a steering wheel and an automobile.
[time=2294] How all the things that are so important today get kind of pushed aside and you really begin to, if I can use the word "meditate" about life, how thankful your heart can become, how sharp your focus can be.
[time=2309] Jesus took them to a tree top to sharpen their focus.
[time=2314] And he began with speaking first about happiness.
[time=2318] Through every civilization, through every generation, mankind has been on a surge for happiness.
[time=2324] The ancient Greeks divided themselves into two schools of thought on how happiness would be achieved.
[time=2331] There was the epicurean or the serenade school that says "Happiness is found through possession and indulgence." It's characterized by the old statement, "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we may die."
[time=2347] They said that if you're going to find happiness, your happiness is going to be flound in indulgence.
[time=2353] Today we call that individual the existentialist.
[time=2359] The Greeks had another school.
[time=2361] Stoicism really produced even sharply by the Romans.
[time=2366] The taught, "No, it's not indulgence, but it's duty." It's for fulfilling one's obligation to society and to the gods and to life.
[time=2375] And it's by discipline that duty is wrought, and devotion is achieved by work.
[time=2381] So the Romans and the Greeks had a second school of thought that says, "Don't indulge, but deny." In society, those two schools of thought have been renamed, reshaped, and remade, and served up in every way is the ultimate answer to happiness.
[time=2399] Jesus teaches now something completely different than either one.
[time=2405] Ironically, paradoxical, antithetical, counter-dictory to everything that I've ever heard in life, Jesus says, "Happiness is this." Let's look at his first four statements for today.
[time=2417] First of all, "Blessed is the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "Blessed are the poor." That word "poor" is the most descriptive word of someone who is an abject poverty.
[time=2432] We often talk about someone being poor, and actually they're doing quite well.
[time=2438] There is a word that the Greeks had for someone who is poor, meaning the proverbial one who ran out of money before he ran out of month.
[time=2445] That was a word to say someone was short on resources.
[time=2449] However, there was a second word that was not to describe the one who was short on resources.
[time=2455] It was to describe the one who had no resources.
[time=2458] That is our word here.
[time=2460] It's often used to describe a beggar, someone who possessed no land, no home, nothing.
[time=2467] And they simply existed by sitting at a point of high traffic
[time=2473] in a commercial district begging for their existence.
[time=2480] Jesus said, "Blessed is that one who is so poor they have absolutely no resources at all." Now don't miss his descriptive phrase "poor" in spirit.
[time=2494] God never puts a premium on poverty.
[time=2501] There is a false sense of pietism that has grown up around Christianity.
[time=2506] That somehow God likes poor people more than he likes rich people.
[time=2511] That's not true.
[time=2512] Or was it true that God likes rich people more than he likes poor people?
[time=2516] But there's become a false, pietistic hypocrisy about Christians today.
[time=2522] Whenever God blesses us, we find it so difficult to say, "Yeah, I've got to admit to you.
[time=2527] I'm doing pretty well financially.
[time=2529] God's really blessed me." You know, whenever somebody says, "Wow, that's really a nice home you have." Well, let me tell you the deal I got on this.
[time=2538] You know, we don't want people to think we spend a lot of money.
[time=2540] You know, we want to remain this humble person poor, even though we're not.
[time=2545] We're desperately trying to make you think we've really got it, and then we turn around and want to make you think, "Well, you know, we really don't have that much." Oh, that's a wonderful dress.
[time=2555] That just looks so nice on you.
[time=2557] Well, don't tell anybody, it's a blue light special honest.
[time=2559] You know, I don't spend a lot of money on clothes.
[time=2561] You know, I got my priorities right.
[time=2563] God doesn't put a premium on being poor.
[time=2566] Some of his choicest servants, some of the people who walked to the closest beat to the Lord, were extremely wealthy people.
[time=2576] Abraham, when he followed God, a lot of camels followed him.
[time=2582] You know why it was so crushing for Job to lose everything?
[time=2585] That guy had a lot to lose.
[time=2589] And these were two of the people that walked the closest to the Lord.
[time=2593] David, who had a heart after God, had a heart after a few other things too.
[time=2599] God never puts a poverty above abundance.
[time=2605] Don't ever feel like just because you have something.
[time=2610] God especially blessed you and he likes you better, but don't ever feel like just because you're poor, that you now possess some rare quality that the wealthy do not have either.
[time=2619] Jesus said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." What he is saying is take all that we understand about physical poverty and apply that to the soul, and you've got to pipe a person Christ is looking for.
[time=2633] He's saying, "Blessed is the person who does an inventory of their life spiritually." And they say, "God, I'm bankrupt. I don't have anything."
[time=2643] For you see, the people of this day were walking around saying, "I am rich spiritually." There were three groups of people who did that.
[time=2653] The scribes whose job it was to meticulously copy the word, they were detail men.
[time=2658] The Pharisees who were the religious conservatives of the day, they were against everything.
[time=2666] Someone once said about our times that everything that they like is either immoral, illegal, or fattening.
[time=2673] The Pharisees found that to be true about everything.
[time=2676] They were conservative to the bone.
[time=2678] Their favorite phrase was, "I'm again it." The Sadducees were the religious liberals of the day.
[time=2685] Miracles don't happen. Angels don't exist.
[time=2688] Resurrection impossible.
[time=2690] They were the liberals of the day.
[time=2692] But each of these people of these three groups walked around saying, "Spiritually we're rich.
[time=2699] We've got a lot of resources spiritually that we can rely on." They had 350 prohibitions and 265 commandments that they meticulously kept.
[time=2712] And they felt the more commandments they kept and the more prohibitions they avoided, the more spiritual they were, the greater resources they had, the less foundation they could stand before God and say, "God, I've got this. God, I've got that.
[time=2725] Look at all my do's. Look at all my don'ts." And Jesus said, "Blessed.
[time=2732] Happy is the one who is spiritually impoverished, who is destitute of soul, who's bankrupt within.
[time=2739] Blessed is the person who is not reliant because there's nothing to rely on."
[time=2745] Why would Jesus say that?
[time=2748] Because what Jesus is doing is he is beginning to teach them what their righteousness must be like in order to enter into his kingdom.
[time=2758] Let's just sneak ahead a few verses to verse 20 and notice what Jesus said.
[time=2764] "I say unto you, except your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=2772] You shall in no case enter into the kingdom of God." That blew those people away.
[time=2781] I say this with the greatest respect.
[time=2785] What Jesus was saying is this, and I mean this with all respect, unless you're more conservative than the Amish, you're not going to make it to heaven.
[time=2795] No one's going to qualify.
[time=2800] Then he went on sneaking a look ahead again to verse 48, he says this,
[time=2807] "Be ye therefore perfect just as your father in heaven is perfect."
[time=2814] Here were a whole group of people saying because of our traditions, because of our laws, because of our conservatism, we believe that we've got something to stand on and God said, unless you've got more than that, you're not going to make it.
[time=2826] As a matter of fact, you've got to have to make it as perfection.
[time=2829] Absolute moral perfection, and obviously none of them and none of us possess it.
[time=2835] That's why Jesus said blessed are happy as the one who recognizes their spiritual insolvency.
[time=2843] Because it's not until we recognize that we do not have anything to offer God that we're now free to receive from God what he has to offer to us.
[time=2852] You know, you can never fill a full cup.
[time=2856] It's absolutely impossible.
[time=2858] You can never fill a full cup.
[time=2861] It first has to be emptied.
[time=2863] And until we empty ourself of all of our man-made, self-made righteousness that God says is the equivalent to filthy rags and stop trusting in who we are,
[time=2874] what we've done, what commandments we've kept, we came to church, we gave money, and still we empty ourselves of all that we can never receive.
[time=2882] God's righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2887] That's why he said happy is the one who is spiritually poor, happy is the one who recognizes they possess nothing because now they can receive my son Jesus Christ whom alone can give eternal life.
[time=2901] And he said that individual will receive the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2907] You know, it's a rather probing question, but what is it you trust in today?
[time=2913] So many come to church and they think their participation here earns them credit with God.
[time=2921] We thank you that you've come today and you've worshiped with us, but attendance here can do no more to get you to heaven than attendance at a football game.
[time=2931] Some of you have given in an offering faithfully and we appreciate that.
[time=2935] We really do, but if you think your giving is going to get you gained in heaven, I hate to disappoint you, might as well have gone out and spent the money because you can't buy your way there.
[time=2947] All of our wealth, all of our deeds, all that we are leaves us bankrupt.
[time=2951] And when we recognize that then we're going to find happiness because we'll find then we can receive Christ as Savior.
[time=2959] Jesus made a second statement.
[time=2960] He said, "Blessed are those that mourn." Jesus is not sadistic or masochistic.
[time=2969] He wasn't saying, "Hey, get off on it." You know, find some type of bizarre gratification and hurts.
[time=2977] Waller in your misery, fine relief in it.
[time=2981] That's not what he said when he said, "Blessed are those that mourn." What he is speaking of is sequential.
[time=2987] He's saying, "Blessed is the man or woman who sees that their spiritually bankrupt and blessed are they that they mourn about that."
[time=2998] John R.W. Stott, the great Anglican preacher of England, said, "It is one thing to see that we are spiritually bankrupt and admit it,
[time=3011] but it's altogether another thing to mourn about that."
[time=3017] He was saying, "Blessed is the individual who recognizes that they're empty and it brings them to a point of contrition, a brokenness, as David would say, "A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt accept." There is a sorrow to be had.
[time=3034] A sorrow over sin.
[time=3035] As Paul wrote to the Church of Corinth in 2 Corinthians 7 verse 10, "Godly sorrow worketh under repentance." Jesus was saying, "Blessed is that one who mourns over their spiritual air,
[time=3053] for they shall be comforted.
[time=3055] They shall be comforted." Do you know the most appropriate character we can have today is one of brokenness and contriteness?
[time=3065] It's altogether the opposite of the spirit of arrogance and pride.
[time=3070] So what?
[time=3072] Who cares?
[time=3074] You know in our society that it's become popular not only to do the wrong thing but to be proud of it.
[time=3082] And to kind of show our macho to say, "Yeah, I can do the wrong thing and I can get away with it." One of the more famous mayors of Chicago known as Abbas was asked a question, "Mayer, how is it that your son became an insurance salesman
[time=3098] in the next day the entire city's benefits were transferred to your son's account?"
[time=3105] The mayor just pulled up his belt and said, "What's this country coming to when a man can't help his son?" Like, "It's alright if I do it because I do it." That's not what God says.
[time=3118] God says that every indiscretion in our life ought to be greeted by mourning.
[time=3124] And it's not until we mourn over our sin and repent of it and turn from it that will ever find comfort.
[time=3132] The plaguing pain of guilt will linger on until it is mourned and repented and turned away from it will linger on.
[time=3143] Jesus made a third statement.
[time=3146] "Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth."
[time=3152] Again, this is sequential.
[time=3154] He's saying, "Happy is the person who recognizes their spiritual bankrupt.
[time=3160] Happy is the person who mourns about that.
[time=3163] Happy is the person who lives meekly because of that." Have you ever found a proud, arrogant beggar?
[time=3173] I doubt that you will.
[time=3176] Have you ever found a person who was broken with pain in their life be it physical pain or bereavement who was bossy in demanding?
[time=3185] You usually don't.
[time=3187] They're usually very meek.
[time=3190] Jesus was saying, "Blessed are those that are meek." Too often, though, I misunderstand meekness to be weakness.
[time=3199] But it's impossible to be both meek and weak.
[time=3203] For meek, by its definition, is power under control.
[time=3206] So in order to be meek, you have to have power.
[time=3209] But the meek person is the one who takes that power and puts it under control.
[time=3216] Aristotle and his nickel-makian athletes said, "Every virtue is actually the golden mean between two vices.
[time=3223] Courage is the golden mean between the one who is full-hardy and the one who is cowardice."
[time=3229] "Meekness," said Aristotle, "was the virtue between the one who is always angry and the one who is always apathetic and never becomes angry."
[time=3240] William Barkley translated it this way.
[time=3243] "Happy is the man who is always angry at the right time and is never angry at the wrong time."
[time=3249] It's a great definition until you say, "Well, when's the right time and the wrong time?" Well, I've done a lot of thinking about that this week, and I pretty much figured out when's the right time and when's the wrong time.
[time=3260] When I get angry, that's the right time.
[time=3264] It's that simple.
[time=3267] Well, we may need to dig a little deeper.
[time=3270] So anger is not totally inappropriate.
[time=3273] The Bible says be angry, but sin not.
[time=3278] It says don't let the sun go down on your wrath, but it says plenty about wrath being acceptable and a quality of God.
[time=3286] Anger is appropriate when it is a spirit that is kindled when we see justice and mercy
[time=3292] and the character of God being violated.
[time=3295] Then it's right.
[time=3297] It's never right when it's simply frustration, born out of self-interest and self-pride.
[time=3303] A meek person is a person who has that all under control.
[time=3308] Jesus said, "That person will inherit the earth." Then his fourth statement again builds on that.
[time=3316] He said, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness so they shall
[time=3322] be filled." What do you hunger after today?
[time=3327] What do you thirst for?
[time=3329] What appetites are you earnestly desiring to gratify?
[time=3337] I'm sure there are many that each of us possess.
[time=3342] But the pursuit of appetite will never bring happiness.
[time=3346] One of the most basic counseling techniques is this.
[time=3350] To take a discouraged person or a frustrated person are two people at odds with each other
[time=3356] and ask this one question.
[time=3358] What one thing would make you the happiest right now?
[time=3360] What is it that is absent from your life if you had it and you now received it would make
[time=3367] you the happiest?
[time=3368] It's very interesting that often you can achieve that thing for someone and they're not one bit happier because fulfillment of appetite will never bring satisfaction.
[time=3379] Jay Paul Getty, a billionaire many times over at his death about ten years ago, was asked
[time=3386] what one thing do you wish you had?
[time=3389] He said, "That's quite easy contentment." No appetite will ever be gratified.
[time=3397] Totally.
[time=3398] Oh, for a moment.
[time=3400] But there is only one appetite that you can have that will be continually and daily met.
[time=3405] And that is the hunger and the thirst for God, His Word and His righteousness.
[time=3411] If there's anything that will make us happy, it's when we build on this gradual step-by-step
[time=3417] plan that Christ has of being poor in spirit, of being mournful over our sins, of being
[time=3427] meek in our temperament and hungering and thirsting after Him.
[time=3433] When those values dominate our life, then we will find happiness.
[time=3453] You've been listening to our pastor Rick Hawk speak from the Word of God.
