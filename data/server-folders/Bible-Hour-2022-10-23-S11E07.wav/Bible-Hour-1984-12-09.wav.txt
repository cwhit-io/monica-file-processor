[time=0] (mysterious music)
[time=30] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Bible Hour.
[time=62] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=69] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=79] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=82] - First floor together, [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=137] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=148] What a joy it is for us to anticipate the coming of Christmas.
[time=152] We wanna welcome you to our morning worship service and to our many friends who join us for the Bible Hour, a word of welcome as well.
[time=160] But today is the day that it all begins to happen in terms of building the living Christmas tree.
[time=165] Our choir has been working and laboring.
[time=168] People have been working on the computer and the lights are already up in the ceiling, but about oh, two to three minutes after church ends, they're gonna start building the tree here today.
[time=177] And we look forward to that great opportunity of announcing to the world that Jesus Christ is born.
[time=185] Last year as a part of our living Christmas tree, we heard the song for the first time, There is Peace.
[time=191] It's become a favorite of this church.
[time=193] It reminds us not only of last year's living Christmas tree, but it tells us that in the midst of every storm of life, There is Peace.
[time=202] Perhaps this morning, you're recovering from a storm.
[time=206] What an encouragement it is to know that God promises us that when we walk through the valley, He walks with us.
[time=213] Are you in a storm today?
[time=215] In the midst of every storm of life, There is Peace.
[time=218] (gentle music)
[time=232] [MUSIC - 279 seconds]
[time=537] - It was peaceful that night when Jesus Christ lay in the manger.
[time=541] Let's reenact that as we sing together probably the most loved Carol of all.
[time=545] Silent night, him number 111, silent night.
[time=549] We'll sing the first, second and fourth stanzas together.
[time=553] (gentle music)
[time=565] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=706] Perhaps that melodious singing is just a taste of the angelic singing that we'll participate when God gives us all new voices and we are airless in our singing.
[time=715] It will be a glorious time when we talk and sing together in heaven, yet you gave us just a little taste of that as you participated in our singing today.
[time=723] Thank you for that.
[time=725] Let's continue the theme of Bethlehem and the Christ child as we listen to Susan Toyrak sing for us.
[time=731] Listen to the message that she has in her song.
[time=736] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
[time=1018] (gentle music) - Again, we want to welcome you to the Bible Hour
[time=1034] and trust that as we see these days approaching Christmas, that you're having a very joyous and merry holiday season.
[time=1042] Last night, we had a Christmas party with our staff and deacons at our home and had such a delightful time together.
[time=1048] Mr. Koby was the first to leave.
[time=1050] Maybe that's why you were on time this morning and I was late, but it's been busy for you, hasn't it?
[time=1055] We are in the last stages of preparing the Christmas tree.
[time=1058] In fact, today the construction begins right after our morning service.
[time=1062] All of the tickets are gone and there are a lot of people on a waiting list, so there's anyone that has tickets and you're not using them, please return them to the church.
[time=1073] If you're using your tickets, Rick, I think we should remind them that people come very early to get a seat and you might be aware, too, that the ticket is good up until 10 minutes before the concert begins and then there are some people that wait in line for the possibility of some seats after the people with tickets have come in.
[time=1094] - Pete, I'm glad you brought that out.
[time=1095] It is an exciting event and the tickets that we give you is a general ticket.
[time=1100] There aren't reserve seats, meaning that gives you row two, seat three and it's just an open auditorium and people start arriving very early, usually about an hour ahead of time and your ticket will guarantee you a seat up till 10 minutes before the concert begins and we hope that you come.
[time=1117] Pete, you mentioned that the tree goes up today.
[time=1119] I think we're sitting exactly under the tree at this moment, so that may help people to get an idea of how big the tree is and where it is located here in the building, but we are looking so forward to that.
[time=1130] What final touches are yet to be done?
[time=1133] - Well, we have the bows to put on, a construction crew puts up the steel today and then tonight we will put on all the bows and the lights and tomorrow morning, the ladies will come in and do the final touches of putting bows on and seeing that everything is in order that the men have done and will decorate with Garland and the sides of the tree, the set on each side has to be constructed tomorrow because there are a lot of activities yesterday we had, we worked in here and we had construction all over the gym floor until about 4.30 and then we quickly cleaned up by 5.30 there were basketball players on this very floor and then shortly after that the men were cleaning up to get ready for our church service today.
[time=1175] So it's been an active time in this Convocation Center.
[time=1179] - And today looks to be about the same, and that's exciting.
[time=1183] We're not complaining at all about the extra use.
[time=1186] It just is a great reward for us to have the privilege of sharing Christmas with you.
[time=1191] We do that through taking music that honors the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1195] But something that we want you to do is to study God's word and not rely on our music department or our television ministry.
[time=1203] So we're making available to you this booklet entitled Timeless Insights.
[time=1208] Timeless Insights is a daily Bible study tool that will take you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1216] On today's lesson titled Good is Gold, we're located in Luke chapter six and looking at the Golden Rule.
[time=1223] It's rather interesting to note that today in our study and the message will be in Matthew chapter five and there's a great deal of overlap between Matthew five and Luke six.
[time=1234] It'll be a few weeks in our study before we'll preach on the Golden Rule so you can study ahead if you're presently involved in Timeless Insights.
[time=1243] Another interesting thing to me today is that the commentator for our lesson is Matthew Henry, one of the most popular Bible commentators and as we come to the end of this year, we'll be writing letters to many of you telling you how you can receive a copy of Matthew Henry's commentary.
[time=1259] How Timeless Insights works is each day there's some scripture to read, then there is a timeless insight, meaning an insight or timeless comment made by someone like Matthew Henry, then very appropriately, a timeless response.
[time=1273] How you and I can respond to God's word.
[time=1275] We'd like to send this to you so you can begin your habit of Bible study.
[time=1280] Pete, would you tell our friends how they can receive their copy?
[time=1283] Yes, you can receive timeless insights by writing to the Bible Hour, box 15,000.
[time=1288] Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1293] That's the Bible Hour, box 15,000.
[time=1296] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1299] Well, Pete, we are excited about the tree coming but I'm even excited about the little things that happen day by day and we continually get words of encouragement from television, from our church about our school and we're simply praising God as we come to this holiday season and want to invite you this hour to worship and study God's word, music and song and then through the message and praise God together with us.
[time=1325] (gentle music)
[time=1336] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1396] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=1545] - Thank you, Brian, for the reminder that in all the lights,
[time=1567] all the glitter and all the tinsel to be listening for the voice of God.
[time=1572] Now it's so easy for us, including me, to miss the point of it all.
[time=1578] And he had caught up in the season as it's being presented to us by the world around us and to miss the whole point that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever would believe in him should have everlasting life.
[time=1594] This Christmas listened to the voice of God as he would speak.
[time=1598] God, our Father, we would pray this morning that you would indeed speak to our hearts.
[time=1603] We pray that your voice would speak clearly that you would penetrate our hearts and our minds, causing us to see ourselves as you see us.
[time=1613] God, today, reveal to us who we are.
[time=1616] God, also, today, we would ask you to reveal to us who you are that each heart here might discover the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1624] Father, we thank you for those who in recent days have opened up their heart to Christ.
[time=1628] We would pray for them that you would strengthen their faith, cause them to grow and to flourish and to abound in the grace of God.
[time=1636] God, we would pray today for the believer who's been a Christian for so long that the zeal, the spark is worn off.
[time=1647] God refresh us, rekindle the flame within our hearts, keep the fire burning.
[time=1653] God, today, we would also pray that you would be glorified and magnified, that not a church, not a program, and not a person would be lifted up other than the Lord Jesus Christ, that by lifting him up, we might give praise and honor to you, Father.
[time=1667] God, today, we would ask that you would encourage the hearts of those who are not well.
[time=1673] We pray for Pat McIntosh and Judy Dabel, that you would bring about recovery in their lives.
[time=1679] We pray that you would strengthen their family in the days of waiting.
[time=1683] We thank you for those who are recovering.
[time=1686] For Becky Clough, Bob Geller.
[time=1690] We pray for Anna Godfrey.
[time=1691] God, we ask you to encourage the heart of a young woman.
[time=1695] Father, there are more needs than we can name and even know, but we trust you to name them and to know them and to care for them.
[time=1703] Oh God, today, as we study your word, may we find you and in discovering you find happiness or it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1713] Happiness, the elusive dream.
[time=1717] Last week, we looked at the beatitudes as to what did Jesus say brings happiness.
[time=1723] We invite you to open your Bibles for a time of study with us this morning as we're continuing a study of the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1730] As Matthew recorded the words of Jesus in the Gospel according to Matthew and the fifth chapter.
[time=1737] Last week, we looked at the first four B attitudes that are found in verses one through six.
[time=1743] This morning, we have the opportunity to study verses seven through 12, asking the question, what did Jesus say about happiness?
[time=1753] It's interesting in the times in which we live, television brings into our lives, not only this broadcast, but it brings in a variety of television shows and with those television shows a variety of commercials, most of which center about personal happiness.
[time=1768] Many of you have discovered that if you would have just bought in a different make of car, then your life would now be overflowing with meaning and significance.
[time=1776] The purposefulness and happiness would have been yours had you made the appropriate purchase.
[time=1781] Actually, it's not in what car you purchase.
[time=1784] You know that.
[time=1785] It's in what toothpaste you used.
[time=1787] Did you use the right toothpaste this morning?
[time=1789] If you did, no doubt, your teeth sparkled.
[time=1792] People moved out of your way and u'd in odd as you entered the auditorium this morning.
[time=1797] That will bring you happiness.
[time=1799] What is it that brings happiness to life?
[time=1802] As Jesus gave the Beatitudes, he began them with the word blessed.
[time=1806] That's an accurate translation.
[time=1808] Equally, as accurate and honest, however, is the word happy.
[time=1812] Jesus could have just as easily had said happy.
[time=1815] Perhaps that's exactly what he meant because the Greek word can be rendered both.
[time=1819] What did Jesus say about happiness?
[time=1821] Matthew five, verse seven.
[time=1824] Happy, or blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[time=1830] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
[time=1836] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
[time=1845] Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1853] Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and shall persecute you and shall speak all manner of evil against you falsely, for my name's sake.
[time=1865] Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven.
[time=1872] For so persecuted they the prophets, which were before you.
[time=1877] Happiness.
[time=1878] One of America's best loved writers of the 18th century was the author of the scarlet letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne.
[time=1886] In his life, Nathaniel Hawthorne kept the journal, and in his journal he wrote this about happiness.
[time=1893] Happiness, in this world when it comes, comes incidentally, make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us on a wild goose chase, and it is never attained.
[time=1908] Let me say that again, because I think he has really struck on the keynote of what Jesus was saying.
[time=1915] Happiness, in this world when it comes, comes incidentally, make it the object of pursuit, and it will lead us on a wild goose chase, and it will never be attained.
[time=1926] If Jesus teaches anything about happiness, he tells us that happiness can never be attained by pursuing it, that happiness is always the byproduct of a different goal.
[time=1940] Those goals are spelled out in the Beatitudes, but in a phrase, I believe Jesus taught that happiness is the byproduct of walking in holiness or obedience to Christ.
[time=1951] Last week we looked at the first four Beatitudes, this week, the next four, and so that leads us to say Jesus is giving us four more keys to happiness.
[time=1961] First of all, I believe Jesus says this, that if we would be happy, then we would learn to extend mercy, extend mercy.
[time=1972] He said, blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[time=1977] Getting a grip on some of these biblical words is not always easy, mercy and grace.
[time=1984] There's a hymn that says mercy and grace were found together.
[time=1988] Mercy was great and pardon was free.
[time=1991] What do those words mean?
[time=1993] Well, at our caring and sharing service as a church, on Thanksgiving Eve, one of our men walked to the microphone, and gave the best definition I've ever heard of both.
[time=2002] Grace is God giving us what we don't deserve, and mercy is his not giving us what we do deserve.
[time=2011] Out of God's grace, he gives us things we don't deserve.
[time=2014] I don't deserve heaven.
[time=2016] I don't deserve to have my sins washed and cleansed.
[time=2019] That's God's grace that he's giving us something we have not earned, merit it, it doesn't belong to us, but out of his grace God's giving us something we don't deserve.
[time=2030] Mercy is different.
[time=2031] Mercy is that God does not give us what we do deserve.
[time=2034] Mercy means that even though I'm a sinner and I deserve punishment for my sin because the wages of sin is death, God out of his mercy doesn't give me something I deserve which is death and eternal separation from him and hell.
[time=2049] It's of God's mercy that we don't receive the punishment that we do deserve.
[time=2055] In Lamentations, chapter three in verses 22 and 23, Jeremiah wrote these words.
[time=2062] It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed.
[time=2070] His compassion fails not.
[time=2073] Great is thy faithfulness, mercy.
[time=2079] Now, we have been the recipients of mercy because God in Christ has died for our sins forgiveness of our sins and offers us eternal life.
[time=2089] If we're going to be truly fulfilled people, then we're going to have to not only be the recipients of mercy, but the dispensers of it as well.
[time=2097] You know, I remember growing up in all of my life quoting the Lord's prayer.
[time=2103] And that's a worthy recitation, but I need to pray something today and that is God, I didn't mean it.
[time=2110] Because there's a phrase in the Lord's prayer that says, "God, forgive me my trespasses, "just as I have forgiven those who trespass against me." I want to take all those things back, Lord, because I haven't been very forgiving.
[time=2125] I'd like to say, God, take and forgive my trespasses a lot better than I have forgiven those who trespass against me.
[time=2132] Jesus gave a parable to illustrate that when we receive mercy, we're obligated to also give it.
[time=2141] A man was in debt to say that he was up to his throat in bills would not be an exaggeration.
[time=2149] The amount of money he owed his creditor was more than a man could ever earn in his lifetime, earning an average income.
[time=2159] And he went to his creditor and he sought forgiveness in mercy and his creditor magnanimously said, "I forgive you the debt and he set the man free." The man was forgiven much.
[time=2172] And shortly thereafter, he ran into a man who owed him money and immediately threatened the man that if you don't pay me, I'll see that you're locked up.
[time=2186] And this man who had been forgiven much was old little and threatened.
[time=2194] His debtor, if he didn't receive it.
[time=2198] Jesus used that to say this, we've been forgiven much.
[time=2202] We've been forgiven every wrong thought, every wrong word, inappropriate phrase, every deed that we have done that's been wrong.
[time=2210] God said, "I forgive it all in Jesus Christ." And we ran out and say, "How dare you say that to me?" I'll get you, no, the Bible says we're obligated.
[time=2219] And if we're ever going to find happiness in life, that happiness is going to come when we demonstrate mercy.
[time=2228] Webster defines mercy this way.
[time=2231] It is the compassionate treatment of an offender.
[time=2235] There's no doubt about it.
[time=2237] That individual's wrong.
[time=2238] There's no doubt about it.
[time=2239] Justice says punishment should be extended.
[time=2242] And mercy says, "I will treat him compassionately, "compassionately." John R.W. Stott, an Anglican in England, makes sense, doesn't it?
[time=2255] It was a little redundant.
[time=2257] John R.W. Stott has written one of the finest books on the Beatitudes that I've had the privilege of reading, and he makes this comment.
[time=2265] Nothing moves us to forgive, like the wondering knowledge that we ourselves have been forgiven.
[time=2273] And nothing proves more clearly that we indeed have been forgiven than our own readiness to forgive.
[time=2285] Many times, the thought is when we're hurt.
[time=2289] If we can just strike back, then we'll be even.
[time=2294] We can just call out the 18.
[time=2296] We can just give them what they deserve.
[time=2298] Then I'll finally feel happiness again.
[time=2300] Gotta talk to those who have been hurt and have struck back very, very rarely will you find someone who says, "No, I'm happy.
[time=2310] "No, I just feel so good." Now, everything is better in my life.
[time=2315] It doesn't happen.
[time=2317] Actually, what we'll bring about happiness is not our striking back, but our learning to forgive, to show mercy.
[time=2326] How often do you forgive?
[time=2329] Do you ever have a fear of being taken?
[time=2331] Are you afraid that if you forgive somebody that they'll probably just turn around and do it again, and you'll be the sucker?
[time=2338] It just doesn't pay.
[time=2341] You gotta be a good businessman.
[time=2344] You gotta protect yourself.
[time=2345] I mean, how often do you forgive someone?
[time=2348] Well, Peter pondered that question, and he thought he would really impress the Lord.
[time=2354] His question was, "Lord, how many times "should I forgive someone?" And he thought, "I'll say seven, "and this is really gonna impress the Lord." He's gonna say, "Oh, Peter, you're such a compassionate guy.
[time=2364] "You don't have to do it that often." So Peter says, "Lord, how often shall I forgive my brother "who trespasses against me seven times?" And he kind of puffs up.
[time=2376] I'm reading into this just a little bit, but expecting a great praise from the Lord.
[time=2380] Christ's answer was, "No, Peter, not seven times." I know, not seven, not that many.
[time=2387] Christ said, "Seven times 70." Now, if my math is right, and it often is not,
[time=2397] seven times 70 is 490 times.
[time=2401] That's a lot of forgiving.
[time=2402] I believe that if someone did something to us, and we forgave them 490 times, and if they did it a 490 first time, it would probably be a well-engrained character habit of our life to forgive them.
[time=2416] But I'm not sure that Jesus was drawing the line at 490 times either.
[time=2422] Actually, I think what Jesus was doing was using numbers in a more figurative way.
[time=2430] The number seven is often used in Bible and in secular literature to picture that which is perfect or complete.
[time=2438] Do you ever wonder why there are only seven wonders of the ancient world?
[time=2441] That's because that's seven in antiquity represented all total complete.
[time=2447] And what Jesus was saying, you've got to take and forgive them completely, fully every time, times completely, fully every time, forever and ever multiplied by forever and forever, and take that times 100, if you will.
[time=2460] I think what he was saying is we always have got to be a forgiver.
[time=2464] If we're ever gonna find happiness in life, it's gonna be by being a vessel through which God's mercy flows not only to us, but through us to other people.
[time=2476] Beloved, that doesn't come natural for me.
[time=2479] I don't know about you.
[time=2481] That's not my human instinct to forgive.
[time=2485] But by God's grace, when his spirit moves into our heart, we have a new nature and a new ability and a new resource to walk in obedience to Christ and to be forgivers.
[time=2497] I need to be honest with you and talk about an issue that's related to this.
[time=2502] What do you do with the habitual offender?
[time=2509] What do you do with that teenager who is absolutely unwilling to cooperate within the reasonable confines of your home and its structure?
[time=2517] What do you do with that one that will not obey, but habitually, habitually disobeys?
[time=2523] What do you do with an employee whose best quality is their irresponsible?
[time=2532] It gets worse after that.
[time=2534] What do you do?
[time=2536] Do you just keep losing your business and losing it and losing?
[time=2540] Let me ask you a deeper one.
[time=2542] What do you do with an unfaithful spouse?
[time=2546] Not someone who erred and who's repentant, but what do you do with the one who is habitually unfaithful, unwilling to repent and significant, unwilling to change?
[time=2563] What do you do with that willful habitual offender?
[time=2568] I want to suggest four things.
[time=2570] First, I want to suggest that we must be willing
[time=2576] to be walked on.
[time=2577] It's usually my pride that says, "Don't walk on me." It doesn't really spring out of the spirit of God that lives within.
[time=2588] It's my human pride.
[time=2589] I want you to respect me and recognize that I'm someone and don't walk on me.
[time=2595] That's human pride.
[time=2596] The Bible says, "Let this mind be in you," which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being found in the fashion of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and humbled himself and emptied himself.
[time=2614] Said, "Let that mind be in you also." We need to be willing to be walked on.
[time=2623] Secondly, we need to be ready and anxious to forgive.
[time=2627] They were wrong, what they did hurt, more to be anxious to forgive.
[time=2635] Thirdly, open your Bible to Luke 17 and verse three.
[time=2650] Luke 17, three.
[time=2652] Jesus said, "Take heed unto yourselves." If thy brother trusts pass against thee, rebuke him and notice this phrase and if he repent, forgive him.
[time=2669] We need to be willing to be walked on and we need to be ready and anxious to forgive.
[time=2674] But in the case of the habitual fender, the willful fender, there to be rebuked, which means told what was wrong and what is right.
[time=2684] And then, if they repent, where to forgive them?
[time=2689] Forgive multiple infidelity, if they repent.
[time=2693] Forgive total obstinants for years in a teenage son, if he repents, if he repents.
[time=2706] Fourthly, let me suggest that the Bible teaches that we're to refuse to be punitive.
[time=2713] We're to refuse to be punitive.
[time=2717] Even though they have heard us repeatedly and repeatedly, we are to refuse to strike back.
[time=2724] Instead, we're to show mercy.
[time=2728] Yes, to be honest, what I'm saying is this.
[time=2735] We always are ready to show mercy and to grant forgiveness.
[time=2739] But if someone is walking and maintaining a life of disobedience, we don't hate him, we don't strike back, but we cannot treat them as though nothing happened until there's repentance.
[time=2754] Jim Dobson has written an excellent, excellent book on this called "Love Must Be Tough." Speaks directly to the issue of infidelity but transferable to a number of areas of life.
[time=2767] If you're the offender, you need to recognize
[time=2773] that if you're forgiven, it's an act of total mercy.
[time=2775] If you're the offended, we need to recognize
[time=2781] that we're responsible to give that mercy.
[time=2786] And until it comes to our hearts, a merciful spirit,
[time=2794] no matter what happens, we'll never be happy without it.
[time=2797] If we do have that merciful heart, we'll find happiness in spite of the hurts of life.
[time=2806] Would you be happy today?
[time=2808] Extend mercy.
[time=2809] Secondly, Jesus said not only happiness is brought by extending mercy, but it's acquiring purity of heart, acquiring inner purity.
[time=2821] He's contrasting all that he's saying against the religious leaders of the day.
[time=2827] For the sake of time, I can't take you to Matthew 23 right now, but Jesus had some pointed and harsh words at the Pharisees.
[time=2837] They walked around with their religious ceremony like a doctor who's just scrubbed up for surgery.
[time=2842] You've seen it on television.
[time=2844] They go and they very meticulously scrubbed to protect themselves from having any impurities and the bacterial that can infect the patient.
[time=2852] Then they slip on rubber gloves to keep everything pure and clean.
[time=2857] And then they walk around keeping their hands up so as not to touch anything.
[time=2860] So when they go to work on that body, it's as clean as possible.
[time=2864] Well, that's religiously how the Pharisees walked around.
[time=2867] They were kind of, don't touch me, I'm pure.
[time=2870] Your dirt may rub off on me.
[time=2873] They not only obeyed God's laws, they multiplied God's laws 10 times over with picky-unished little details.
[time=2881] Jesus said unto them in Matthew 23, 23, you tithe the mint and anise and cumin.
[time=2888] Now, what are those?
[time=2890] Well, mint's a spice.
[time=2891] You and I know what those are.
[time=2892] Those are all spices that grew naturally in Israel.
[time=2895] Most of the people had it growing wild in their yards.
[time=2898] It was sort of the dandelions of the Middle East.
[time=2900] And these legalistic religious fanatics said, now, if some mint happened to grow in your property, that has a cash value at approximately X number of dollars, and you've got to tithe that, or you're not purer.
[time=2915] Jesus said, you tithe all these petty little things, and you ignore the weightier matters of the law.
[time=2922] What are the weightier matters of the law?
[time=2925] Jesus said, the weightier matters of the law such as justice and mercy and faith.
[time=2931] These you ought to have done and forgotten about the other, said Christ.
[time=2937] Their society in ours, as well, is constantly concerned about outward appearance.
[time=2943] What's on the inside?
[time=2945] None of us can see, so none of us worry about.
[time=2947] And we're constantly trying to take our social values, our political values, our cultural values, and stuff them into the Bibles to support all of our traditions so we can feel good about ourselves because we're biblical, we've war ties today.
[time=2962] We miss the whole point.
[time=2967] Jesus said, you Pharisees are like white encephalicers and full of dead man's bones within.
[time=2977] What are you saying?
[time=2978] You're beautiful on the outside, but inside you're spiritually dead, and if you would find happiness, then you've got to acquire purity inside.
[time=2985] And none of us can do that ourselves.
[time=2989] None of us can make ourselves clean within.
[time=2992] My heart, your heart is darkened with the sinful nature that we're born with.
[time=2997] It is borne out by the sinful things that we've done and it becomes an indictment against us.
[time=3001] And we are not pure.
[time=3003] And Jesus said, blessed are the pure and heart for they shall see God.
[time=3007] And none of us say, we're ever gonna see God because we're not pure.
[time=3010] But you know today you can acquire purity by receiving the Lord Jesus Christ to save you.
[time=3017] This church can't give it to you.
[time=3020] No church can do that.
[time=3023] Religious duty can't give it to you.
[time=3025] That can only mask the outside.
[time=3027] Jesus didn't ask for external purity.
[time=3030] He demanded internal purity.
[time=3032] And the only way we can have that purity is to be washed and nothing can wash it away sin except for the Lord Jesus Christ and His blood, which was shed on our behalf.
[time=3043] Today, would you be happy you've got to purchase a choir piece within in the price tag is reasonable.
[time=3050] It was free.
[time=3051] Christ freely died.
[time=3053] Would you freely receive Him?
[time=3056] Must acquire purity within.
[time=3058] Jesus said, if you'd be happy, extend mercy, acquire purity, thirdly, live peacefully.
[time=3069] Act as a peacemaker.
[time=3074] He said, blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
[time=3080] Now, a peacemaker is someone who not only looks at party A and party B, who are in conflict and tries to be the middleman and negotiate it.
[time=3092] It also means that maybe I'm party A.
[time=3095] Isn't it amazing how when you disagree with your wife
[time=3101] and things aren't going well?
[time=3104] By the way, Kathy and I just had a marvelous week.
[time=3106] We got a long great.
[time=3108] She had laryngitis and couldn't talk.
[time=3110] (audience laughs) And she's in the nursery watching the Bible hour and anybody want to take me home for lunch.
[time=3116] They're not gonna be cooking at my house today.
[time=3119] You ever noticed though, when a husband's and wife and there's that tension at each other, you know what wells up within every one of us?
[time=3126] I'm gonna win this one.
[time=3131] This one's mine.
[time=3134] This one goes in the winner's column for me.
[time=3136] And we lose perspective.
[time=3140] Our concern is over proving I'm right and you're wrong when I win, and I'm gonna hang on until you acquiesce, until you give.
[time=3148] What Jesus was saying, blessed is the one who gives up their right to win.
[time=3154] Happy is the person who doesn't care who's right and who's wrong.
[time=3158] Their chief cares that we live at peace with each other.
[time=3161] This doesn't fit natural for me.
[time=3166] Does it for you?
[time=3170] Everything in the Beatitudes doesn't fit our humanity because our humanity is bent and it's twisted.
[time=3179] And if we're ever going to find happiness, it's going to come through being peaceful, giving up our right to win even when we're right and saying I'm more concerned that you and I live at peace.
[time=3193] We show mercy to each other than I am over who wins and who loses.
[time=3199] Blessed are the peacemakers.
[time=3202] For we who act peacefully will be called the children of God.
[time=3208] Why is that?
[time=3209] Because God sat in heaven and he looked at us and he could have said, I'm right, you're wrong, I'm holding out.
[time=3217] But he said, I'm righteous and you're sinful.
[time=3222] And I love you and I want to forgive you and I want there to be peace.
[time=3229] And so I and the person in Jesus Christ will die for your sin.
[time=3233] And so Paul wrote in Romans 5-1, now we have peace with God.
[time=3238] I'm so thankful he didn't hold out.
[time=3241] Don't hold out, be a peacemaker.
[time=3246] Finally in the Beatitudes Jesus said, there's a fourth key to happiness.
[time=3254] It's accepting mistreatment.
[time=3256] You may be merciful.
[time=3259] You may be pure of motive and conscious within.
[time=3263] You may have acted out peacefully.
[time=3265] You may have given up your right to win and lost just for the sake of peace.
[time=3269] And in spite of all that, it is inevitable that you will be mistreated and so will I.
[time=3274] Jesus said, blessed are they who are persecuted
[time=3283] for righteousness sake, repeat verse 11, but a change of word, blessed are you.
[time=3289] You know, I think why Jesus went for all along.
[time=3293] He's been saying, blessed are those, blessed are they.
[time=3295] Blessed is the one.
[time=3296] It's always been third person out there, but now he makes it second person.
[time=3300] He said, blessed are you.
[time=3302] 'Cause I think he wanted the disciples and we as modern day disciples to recognize that he's applying all this to us.
[time=3310] And this isn't philosophy, beloved, this is life.
[time=3314] And it is inevitable in life that we're gonna be misunderstood.
[time=3317] Now Jesus describes the mistreatment we may receive in three ways.
[time=3324] He said, blessed are they who are persecuted.
[time=3327] That means physical abuse.
[time=3330] It means someone who is relentlessly being pursued, being hostile, being physically abused.
[time=3337] Secondly, he said, blessed are those of you who are reviled.
[time=3342] That's not the physical abuse, that's the verbal abuse.
[time=3345] That's the insult, that's the injury, that's the ridicule, that's the mockery, that's the disgrace, the insult, a whole battery of verbal injury.
[time=3355] And then the third one, false accusation, being slandered, defamed and misrepresented.
[time=3364] In each of those areas, Jesus said, "A happy are you." Jesus wasn't into some sadistic type of values.
[time=3372] It's not what he was saying.
[time=3374] He was simply saying, "If you accept them, "you'll find happiness." Beloved, there's three things that you can do with mistreatment, you've got three choices.
[time=3386] One is you can strike back on the outside.
[time=3389] Someone hurt you, you can strike back.
[time=3393] I doubt that you'll feel any better.
[time=3396] That's an option.
[time=3397] Most of us don't strike back because we don't have the courage or the know-how.
[time=3403] We take the second option.
[time=3405] That is we grow bitter on the inside.
[time=3411] Because we can't throw a stick of dynamite, we just smolder with a flame within.
[time=3416] Burning hostility.
[time=3419] But there's a third option.
[time=3422] That is that we can accept the mistreatment.
[time=3425] We can recognize that we get what we don't deserve.
[time=3428] That we can accept it and live by it.
[time=3433] And by God's grace, find the power to forgive.
[time=3439] Just as we've been forgiven.
[time=3441] Have you been forgiven?
[time=3443] Then be a forgiver.
[time=3444] This whole thing.
[time=3446] This is the day that the Lord hath made.
[time=3453] Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=3455] I hope that you've had the opportunity to worship with us through the ministry of music and the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3462] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a minute and pray with you.

[time=3471] Dear Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for the announcement of the Savior.
[time=3477] Jesus coming to this earth to die from my sins.
[time=3482] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3488] I ask you to do that, dear Lord, today.
[time=3490] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
