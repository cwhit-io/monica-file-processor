[time=2089] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2095] Thank you, Missy. The Bible says in Psalm 40, "He brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the Myery Clay, and set my feet upon a rock.
[time=2105] He established my goings, and he had put a new song in my heart." I trust this morning that God has put a new song in your heart, a song even appraised to our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2118] Before we open His Word to study it, let us first open our hearts to Him in prayer. God, we're thankful today that you put a song in our heart that you lift us up out of the Myery Clay, put within our very being the Spirit of God. Father, we thank you today for the Lord Jesus who came that we might have life and that we might have it more abundantly. God, we thank you for the forgiveness of sins, the sense of being washed and cleansed and made white as snow.
[time=2146] God, we praise you for our spiritual benefits. We thank you for your goodness upon this nation. It's blessing and it's freedom.
[time=2154] We thank you for the food that we eat today, and pray God even with our eating there might be a spirit of thanksgiving and desire to share with others. God, we thank you for your mercies and pray that they might extend to the families of Pat McIntosh and Judy Dable. We pray for recovery for those who have gone through surgery in recent days for Darrell Good and Anna Godfrey. We pray for the Eisenhower family that you'll strengthen them while they wait on a mother in a coma.
[time=2186] God, we pray that you'd pour out your grace and sustain each heart. God, there are so many that heard and yet today God, we're confident your grace is sufficient and we ask you to pour it out.
[time=2198] As we study your Word today, God, we ask you to speak to our hearts and to our minds. For it's in Jesus' name, we pray.
[time=2206] Amen. If you have a Bible with you, we invite you to open with us for a time of study and the gospel according to Matthew.
[time=2214] This week, we are studying Matthew 5 verses 13 through verses 16.
[time=2222] Next week, we'll look at the topic, what did Jesus say about himself?
[time=2226] On Christmas morning, we'll ask the question, why has Jesus come and we'll look at his own answer? But today, we're going to study what did Jesus say about Christian influence? For the past two weeks, we've looked at the Beatitudes, those statements that began, "Blessed is the one," or translated accurately, "Happy are they," the Beatitudes. They spoke primarily of Christian character, the testimony of our lives, the fabric that we are woven with, that speaks about the quality of life in the Lord Jesus, that we are to demonstrate the qualities of being a peacemaker, or being pure within the equality of being one who hungers in thirst after righteousness, the desire of being humble and poor in spirit and meek in demeanor. When we demonstrate the ability to accept disappointment and mistreatment in our life, and yet remain joyous, we then are truly the blessed and happy people. If that character, if those qualities are demonstrated in our life, then we will have influence. Jesus now speaks about the influence of the Christian. Matthew 5, verse 13, "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost its saver, with what shall be it salted.
[time=2310] It is therefore good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.
[time=2318] You are the light of the world. A city set upon a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but put it on a lampstand and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
[time=2334] Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven." Here in this passage, Jesus gives two things that a Christian is to be by way of influence.
[time=2350] First, He said we're to be salt, and secondly, He said we're to be light.
[time=2354] Both of these are very precious commodities today and much more so in the ancient world. It was Philo who said the world needs more salt and more sunshine. To the ancients, when Jesus would use these metaphors, these analogies, he was giving to them something that they readily understood. Salt had some primary uses in their society, and Jesus was saying just as salt is used, so you are to provide that same benefit to this world.
[time=2382] Well then it would be helpful for us to know what is it that salt did in the ancient world. There are a number of things that salt did, but there are some that were primary. First of all, salt acted as a preservative. In the ancient world they didn't have whirlpool refrigerators. That would have been tough on my family.
[time=2402] We've been applying to repairmen for 30 years, but they didn't have a whirlpool there that they could go open up. How did they preserve their meat?
[time=2410] Meat that would be cut and put in the open market in the middle east with its high temperatures would begin to spoil almost immediately.
[time=2418] There had to be some way of preserving the meat.
[time=2422] Salt was taken and was rubbed into the meat. That coarse salt would have a chemical reaction with the meat,
[time=2430] and it would act as a retardant against decay. Salt was a preservative. Even today there are those meats that are made available without refrigeration that have been preserved in salt.
[time=2442] And in our modern society we use a few other chemicals, but salt is still chief amongst the preservatives. So Jesus was saying you are the preservative of society.
[time=2454] What did he mean by that? Well Jesus viewed the world in need of preservation and dark in the need of light.
[time=2462] And what he was saying is that the Christian is the function in a decaying deteriorating society to preserve it to maintain its moral values and its moral integrity. We are to be the preservative of society and culture. It's rather interesting to note that coming out of the finney revivals of the 1820s, 30s and 40s came an age of reform in this country.
[time=2486] Historians, both church historians and secular historians alike call it the second great awakening in America. What is interesting to note is that out of those revivals of evangelical Christianity came great periods that reform in our society.
[time=2502] It was during the days of spiritual revival that the abolition of slavery became an issue. Born out of the evangelical commitment to honor God and to understand the brotherhood of all men, the evangelical church led the way in this country in the 1830s and 40s to bring about the eradication of slavery from this land. Abraham Lincoln, who was most famous for being against slavery, was actually developmental in his view of slavery. He first believed in a colonization program of taking those who were black and sending them back.
[time=2538] He didn't see at first the value of recognizing that a man black or white, red or yellow, was an equal value before God and they were brothers. It wasn't until the revival that swept this nation that there came a plan to eradicate slavery and to make the black man free. And he is our brother.
[time=2558] It was born out of that evangelical movement that slavery was ended in this country. During the same period, this slavery issue was being addressed. Social reform came in a number of other ways.
[time=2570] It was during the reforms of the 1840s that prison reform began in this country. Prisoners were treated with not only disdain but subject to poverty and abuse and reforms came to our penitentiaries for the first time born out of an evangelical revival in this country. Christians were functioning as a result, being a pro-observitive in a decaying society.
[time=2594] So it is today that Jesus would say to us, "We are the salt of the earth." What would we then do? I believe that we have that same responsibility of taking to our society the message and the standards of God's Word and preserving it from its further decay. I believe that we have responsibility today. When we look at a nation who is slaying its unborn children millions to say with clarity, abortion is wrong.
[time=2622] That the Word of God teaches that birth is not the beginning of life but that life begins a conception. Jeremiah, the prophet says, "God has ordained me a prophet from my mother's womb." When Jeron the Baptist was yet in his mother's womb. And Mary would come to his mother and say that the Messiah was coming. The baby leaped in her womb with joy.
[time=2642] It had life. Abortion stands contrary to the values of the Word of God. If we are to be salt, if we are to be a preservative, we must speak.
[time=2650] We must not be silent. We as a congregation are responsible today to recognize in a world that is dying and hunger and famine or sweeping that if we are to function by the grace of God there must be compassion in our heart and generosity with our friends around the world. We are to be salt.
[time=2670] Salt not only represented that which preserved it had other purposes too. Salt also provided flavor.
[time=2678] Rather interesting statement in Job.
[time=2682] Job must like to eat it like I do. Job chapter 6 says this in verse 6, "Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" You ever noticed that? Egg whites just aren't that fun, are they? First thing you do, and I like better devil eggs. They put the mayonnaise in there and mix it all. But if you get a plain white egg, you desperately have to have salt. It gives flavor. It also gives high blood pressure, but we won't talk about that this morning.
[time=2714] Salt gives flavor. Jesus was saying you are the salt of the earth. You are the ones to give flavor to life. It's unfortunate that we in the evangelical community have become so sober and so stiff that we've lost our sense of enthusiasm for life.
[time=2734] We're to be so effervescent that society looks at us and say whatever those people got, it's great and I want it.
[time=2742] Somehow we've lost that over the last century.
[time=2746] One excellent bible commentator has put together a number of quotes that refer to the fact that we've lost that sense of joy and flavor in life.
[time=2754] He quotes all of our Wendell Holmes at first who said, "I've entertained the idea of going into the ministry and I would have if certain clergymen I knew had not looked and acted so much like an undertaker." That ought not to be true. And I goofed.
[time=2774] Here I am standing in a navy blue three-piece suit looking like an undertaker.
[time=2778] But I hope that we can break that in our attitude of life.
[time=2782] That there's an enthusiasm for life. That as the last of the attitudes that we are happy though persecuted. That's not to say everything's going to go well but it's simply to say within our life there's a confidence in God. We don't look like the undertaker.
[time=2798] We don't act like him. Robert Louis Stevenson on the same vein said, "With a snow to surprise, I went to church today and I'm not depressed. Amazing isn't it?" That is so often true that churches have become morgs with a steeple.
[time=2819] The pit of depression come in and suffer anxiety with us.
[time=2823] It needs to be life. You know every once in a while Pete and I are dale singing, "We go upstairs and we review the Bible or tapes." They're all right but congregational singing sounds good. It just doesn't look too good.
[time=2837] You'd think that someone gave out prune juice and communion last night the way most of us look.
[time=2843] We're dying there.
[time=2847] Where's the life? We're supposed to be the flavor of society.
[time=2851] Can egg whites be eaten without salt? Can life be lived without flavor? No. Where does the flavor come from? Society is desperately crying out. What is it that gives life? It's meaning it's joy until they go off on their trips and come back empty and burn out because we look like undertaker or to be the ones that give flavor to society but there was another purpose for salt as well. Salt not only acted as a preservative it not only was an agent that gave flavor but thirdly salt was used to create a thirst. If you notice the sprite commercials they play them constantly. Here's this poor tired, weak, emaciated figure crawling across the desert staggering for lack of food and water and he comes into a place a canteen in the old west and they quickly pour him some water and he pushes it aside and says give me some dry old potato chips.
[time=2911] And they say go ahead build that thirst. You know that's what I'm supposed to do. That's what you're supposed to do. We're supposed to be out in this society building that thirst so that more people are finding their home ground to be Matthew 5'6" where it says blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. There is supposed to be in our character such a winsomeness that people look at us and they actually become jealous and covet what we possess. Now we're taught clearly that jealousy and covetousness are all wrong that's if you're coveting everything that a person has materially but it's alright I think to covet what someone has spiritually because Paul said covet the better gifts.
[time=2959] You know we need to be we need to be so attractive in Christ that we create a flavor that is desirable and people have an appetite to have what we have.
[time=2971] Wouldn't it be great if two or three times a week someone came up to us and says hey I'm sorry but I gotta have it whatever you've got give it to me. What is it that makes you tick?
[time=2983] I gotta make confession. It doesn't happen to me either.
[time=2987] You know I really believe that if we lived in the be attitudes we would have the influence of the similitudes of salt and light. God says be salt preserve the society give it flavor create a thirst after God. Secondly Jesus said not only are we to be the salt of the earth but secondly he said we are to be the light of the world. Light was primarily used to do things to reveal
[time=3017] the hidden things of darkness and to give direction.
[time=3021] Keep your attention here in Matthew with a finger but then look at John chapter 1
[time=3027] John chapter 1 John speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ verse 4 says this in him was life and the life was the light of men
[time=3041] and the light shined in the darkness and the darkness overcame it not.
[time=3047] Jesus is the light of the world John chapter 3 verse 19 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. You see one of the chief things that light does when it illuminate it reveals. When the spirit of God is alive in working he reveals areas of darkness in everyone's life. I used to work in instruction while I was in college and I had the privilege of working with some Amish cartenders who were very patient with a city boy who had to be taught everything and when I would frame something in and wasn't sure whether it was quite or proper I'd go and I'd say Levi is this all right. He got tired of coming over and checking my work and he finally said if a blind man can't see it from the road on a galloping horse at midnight it's okay.
[time=3103] I've taken that principle out of carpentry and applied it to most areas of my life. You know if a blind man can't see it on a galloping horse from the road at midnight it's okay.
[time=3115] You know and someone turns on the lights.
[time=3119] That's what the Lord Jesus Christ does.
[time=3123] He says the standards higher you can't hide it in the darkness.
[time=3127] Every once in a while our girls will shall we say leave their room in a slight state of disarray.
[time=3135] We applied for Bob Ward to give us government disaster relief funds the other day. And it's amazing how smart they are. They quickly when it's nighttime and they turn out the lights. They know you can't see.
[time=3147] Don't we like to do that? We like to turn out the lights but Jesus said I am the light of the world.
[time=3155] And when he lights up men he reveals in our hearts our desperate need for forgiveness and salvation is got turned on the light in your heart. Can you see today that you need the Lord Jesus Christ a Savior? I hope that you do.
[time=3171] And secondly light not only provided a revealing of hidden things but it provided guidance. While in the wandering the children of Israel would be guided by a cloud at day and by night a pillar a fire a light that would guide them. Light has always been the symbol of direction. Here the Bible says that God will direct and he will guide. An interesting progression in scriptures. John 8 12 Jesus said I am the light of the world. He said of themself I'm the light. John chapter 9 verse 5 he said wow I am in the world I am the light of the world.
[time=3211] And now here in Matthew 5 he says you are the light of the world. What he means by that is Jesus is the light but that light is now taken out of the world and is being reflected to the world indirectly through believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Just as the sun gives direct illumination but at nighttime the sun reflects its light off of the moon and then comes to the earth we reflect the light of the Lord Jesus Christ. Someone says that and they'll make us moonies. No it does not. It is simply by illustration to say that just as the moon reflects the light of the sun so we are to reflect the life of the sun so when. We are to be the ones that give light to this world. Those are two things that Jesus has called us to be. He's called us to be salt and he's called us to be light. Within these two metaphors he also gives two applications.
[time=3275] First he says our lives must be lived with integrity.
[time=3279] He said if the salt loses its savor it's worthless.
[time=3287] It's got to be cast out. You see salt has absolutely no value if it loses its ability to be salt.
[time=3295] In the land around the Dead Sea there would be great deposits of residue that is from the salt that was there that has been decomposed or contaminated. There's no saltiness to it.
[time=3307] The only value they could do was to pick it up and use it to fill the pot holes in the road. Jesus said if we do not live with integrity, our lives are of no value.
[time=3319] You see salt when it loses its integrity or its constitution loses its savor. Christians when we lose our integrity we lose our character and our testimony. We must witness and live with integrity. Secondly though there is another application. Not only must our lives be lived with integrity they must be lived with involvement. Jesus said men don't take a light and quickly put an opaque shade over it so no one can see the light. If you light a light you set it in a prominent place so that it can spread its rays, it can penetrate, it can illuminate.
[time=3359] He says so our lives are to spread and to penetrate and to illuminate. You know there are two dangers that we all pray to. One is to think the world is good when it's totally dark and sinful. The second is to think it's so dark and sinful we've got to escape and to run away. Neither is right.
[time=3379] We've got to be involved in this light. But an interesting point.
[time=3383] It says let your light shine as good works. That word good doesn't simply mean good here bad there and this is good. It does mean that but it means more.
[time=3391] It's a word that means that which is good and attractive and desirable.
[time=3395] The grace and truth. Truth without grace is unpalatable you can't swallow it but when it's combined with the grace it's desirable.
[time=3403] God says our lives are to be involved with good works that are desirable. You say well I thought Jesus said to do your good works privately to pray in a closet the fast and secret.
[time=3415] Well yes the point isn't that you draw attention to yourself when you do good works there to be seen and the proof of it is that the glory doesn't go to us. It goes to the Lord Jesus Christ He alone.
[time=3431] You've been listening to the special music from our teen choir and the second generation
[time=3447] and you've listened to the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3451] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual life I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now.
[time=3459] Dear Heavenly Father I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to this earth to die on the cross for my sins and today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of my sins. I ask you Jesus to come in today and Jesus name I pray. Amen. Please write us and tell us the nature of your decision
[time=3481] and when you write us we'd like to send you a pamphlet entitled Your Decision to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
