[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=60] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=68] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=78] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=82] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=136] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=143] Is the joy to welcome you friends in this auditorium and our friends who are joining us by way of the Bible Hour to our second morning worship service.
[time=151] In our first hour, we had a tremendous time of worship and a praise and a Bible study.
[time=156] What a joy it was at the end of that service to see a young man say, "I've given my heart to Christ, and I want this body of people to know that." Today, that's the very message of Christmas that Christ came to give Himself for us that we can give ourselves to Him.
[time=172] That's our worship this morning, our praise.
[time=175] Not just the songs that we hear or we sing, but it's the worship that comes from the heart that says, "God, I love you today, and I belong to you." I trust that on this Christmas, more than any other gift you have the gift of eternal life that comes by Christ.
[time=189] We're coming to the end of our celebration of Christmas with the living Christmas tree, but what a privilege it is this morning to have our choir singing some of the music, and then indeed to have Stephen Maria Gardner with us.
[time=201] They're part of our church, and we don't get the privilege of having them here week by week because they're always somewhere else serving the Lord.
[time=208] But they're here quite often, and today we get to celebrate Christmas with them and them with us, and they're going to be ministering to us in song today.
[time=216] We're delighted that they're here and that you're here.
[time=218] We trust God.
[time=219] We'll use this hour to strengthen all of us in our commitment to Christ.
[time=231] [MUSIC] God, will be Christmas tree [MUSIC] Is stands on His plan [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] He is starting with the days [MUSIC] From activity to life [MUSIC] All branches full and free [MUSIC] Never reaching out [MUSIC] Has taught all creatures of for you and me [MUSIC] God's children can be judged [MUSIC] For this big increase has free [MUSIC] It symbolizes life of God's own sight [MUSIC] The many, many rise [MUSIC] So brightly shining in the light [MUSIC] Let Jesus is the light for everyone [MUSIC] Let Jesus is the light for everyone [MUSIC] As I feel the tree find thee the power in [MUSIC] Of the cross that bore us [MUSIC] In your morning [MUSIC] At this tree lives [MUSIC] In this, in this, right hand [MUSIC] God will be Christmas tree [MUSIC]
[time=416] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=532] Well Merry Christmas and it's great to be here this morning.
[time=534] It is shared this time with you and the living Christmas tree.
[time=536] This is beautiful.
[time=538] We do hope that you are enjoying this very very special time of celebration.
[time=544] We are.
[time=546] We have a concert tonight in Joliet, Illinois and then we're home for the holidays and it's always great to be home.
[time=552] Steve writes a lot of our music and one day he was going upstairs to write a song and I asked him to please write a Christmas song because I love Christmas music and he came downstairs a little while later and he had written my favorite Christmas song.
[time=564] [MUSIC] Jesus how we thank you [MUSIC] For today to be born there in Bethlehem [MUSIC] On a veil of hate [MUSIC] We know that you chose to come [MUSIC] To take our sins away [MUSIC] And though we cannot understand [MUSIC] We thank you for this day [MUSIC] And though we cannot understand [MUSIC] We thank you for this day [MUSIC] We thank you for the way you came [MUSIC] Humble and unknown [MUSIC] You've shown us how to measure wealth away [MUSIC] We've never known [MUSIC] Gladness comes inside a man [MUSIC] When he gives himself away [MUSIC] And when we give ourselves to you [MUSIC] That gladness comes to stay [MUSIC] And when we give ourselves to you [MUSIC] That gladness comes to stay [MUSIC] So we thank you that you left your home [MUSIC] To suffer here on earth [MUSIC] And thank you for this day [MUSIC] On which we celebrate your birth [MUSIC] We know if you hadn't come [MUSIC] We'd be lost eternally [MUSIC] And so we praise and honor you [MUSIC] Especially on this day [MUSIC] And so we praise and honor you [MUSIC] Especially on this day [MUSIC] And so we praise and honor you [MUSIC] Especially on this day [MUSIC] We need to get to the people of the world [MUSIC] Is thankful for it [MUSIC] Is thankful for it [MUSIC] All the girls and boys [MUSIC] Just to praise the Lord of God [MUSIC] I would bless the Savior's praise and song [MUSIC] And I will ever praise Him with the first I can give [MUSIC] And I will praise Him with the thousand four [MUSIC] Forever for [MUSIC] Over a thousand boys [MUSIC] Just to praise the Prince of Peace [MUSIC] Over a thousand times to praise His name [MUSIC] Over a thousand boys [MUSIC] Just to praise the King of Peace [MUSIC] To the people of the world [MUSIC] Is thankful for it [MUSIC] Is thankful for it [MUSIC] Over a thousand boys [MUSIC] Just to praise the Lord of God [MUSIC] I would bless the Savior's praise and song [MUSIC] And I will ever praise Him with the first I can give [MUSIC] I will praise Him with the thousand four [MUSIC] Praise Him with the thousand four [MUSIC] Forever for [MUSIC] One thousand times forever for [MUSIC]
[time=1015] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=1043] [MUSIC] Where He was, love was there also [MUSIC] Where He went, love showed the way [MUSIC] Oh, so so knew He was holy [MUSIC] And I see what they saw to this very day [MUSIC] Oh, He came special, delivering [MUSIC] Wrapped up in love [MUSIC] Found by a promise [MUSIC] Sealed by a dog filled [MUSIC] With the spirits who carried by grace [MUSIC] You knew where He was going [MUSIC] Where the look on His face [MUSIC]
[time=1114] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=1213] What a day we have to look forward to when the word promises that every one of us who know Him will go special delivery to be with Him, all because from the heart of the Father came the greatest Christmas gift ever, special delivery to each one of us, his very own son.
[time=1229] The words of this next song remind us of the purpose for which you came. Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today.
[time=1249] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=1383] Once you have received the holy one of Israel into your heart, accepting him as Savior, then we have a divine responsibility, a privilege of making him known to people around us.
[time=1395] I love the story of this song, how each one, according to his ability, left the news be known.
[time=1403] Said the night went to the middle end. Do you see what I see when the sky will land?
[time=1417] Do you see what I see, a star, a star dancing in the night with a tail as big as it might?
[time=1430] With a tail as big as it might?
[time=1437] Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy. Do you hear what I hear?
[time=1447] Bringing through the sky shepherd boy. Do you hear what I hear?
[time=1456] A song, a song high above the trees, where the voice has big as the sea.
[time=1465] Where the voice has big as the sea.
[time=1470] Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king. Do you know what I know?
[time=1484] In your palace one mighty king. Do you know what I know?
[time=1493] A child, a child, shivers him and call. Let us bring him silver and gold.
[time=1502] Let us bring him silver and gold. Said the king to the people everywhere.
[time=1512] Listen to what I say.
[time=1517] Brief with these people everywhere.
[time=1522] Listen to what I say.
[time=1526] The child, the child, sleeping in the night.
[time=1531] He will bring us goodness and light.
[time=1566] Thank you, Steve Maria. What a joy it is to be able to sing praises unto our God.
[time=1572] Today we've come because the good news has been shared with us, and now it's our privilege to share it with others.
[time=1578] Before we open the scriptures to study them, let us first open our heart to the Lord in prayer.
[time=1584] Our God and our Father, we bow before you today, thanking you that the news has been spread everywhere
[time=1591] and it has reached our hearts that Jesus Christ has come.
[time=1595] God, it seems so trite today to say thank you for a gift of life that cost you your son.
[time=1602] But through our feeble and ignoble attempts, God, we today bow before you and say thank you for Jesus Christ who gave us life.
[time=1611] It was given us spiritual blessing that we have access to you in prayer, that we have peace with God,
[time=1617] that we have cleansing of soul and forgiveness. God, we thank you for the restoration of fellowship to you.
[time=1624] God, we thank you that your word gives light unto our past so that our lives have direction.
[time=1630] We thank you that there is purpose to our living and our soul has abundance and fulfillment.
[time=1636] God, we thank you for your goodness upon us materially.
[time=1640] All these facilities and equipment that we have, this auditorium that so meets our needs, God, we give you thanks.
[time=1649] Father, we thank you for the people who labor and love to bring the living Christmas tree, Sunday school, the Bible hour,
[time=1658] super sixties and all the ministries of our Christian school and our church.
[time=1663] God, we thank you for people and their kindred heart, their fellowship and unity of body.
[time=1669] God, we would pray that you draw our hearts, knit this together.
[time=1673] We pray that from that united heart, God, that you would give us outreach, that we would reach out to win others to Christ.
[time=1680] Father, today, we pray even for those who are part of this audience.
[time=1685] They would never receive Christ that today they would.
[time=1688] Father, we pray that you would speak to the hearts of believers, giving direction.
[time=1692] And God, most of all, we pray that you would speak words of comfort to the dables and the macintoshes, to others whose families are separated during this time when families are normally together.
[time=1704] God, in particular, we pray for the herd of those who have suffered loss of loved one, for the one today who celebrates Christmas alone for the first time.
[time=1714] God, we pray for those today.
[time=1717] We think of the ones who have lost through divorce, unwanted, undesired.
[time=1722] The herd have rejected and now the sting of loneliness.
[time=1726] God, we pray that you would be a leaning post to these hearts.
[time=1729] We pray that through your word you would strengthen each of us that our lives might be to the praise and the glory and the honor of your name.
[time=1737] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1740] Christmas, the time when we celebrate the fact that Jesus is come.
[time=1747] Why did He come?
[time=1749] What was the purpose of Christ coming?
[time=1752] In Matthew 5th chapter, Jesus tells us why Christmas, why He came.
[time=1758] If you have your Bible with you today, we're going to study what did Jesus say about His coming?
[time=1764] We're looking at Matthew 5th chapter, studying through the Sermon on the Mount, and today we'll be looking at verses 17 through 20.
[time=1774] If you have your Bible, I invite you to follow along silently while I read for you.
[time=1780] Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.
[time=1784] I am not come to destroy but to fulfill. For barely I say unto you till heaven and earth pass, one jar or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.
[time=1801] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1813] But whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1821] For I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1832] Why did Jesus come?
[time=1834] Here in this passage He gives us the reasons why He came and the reasons why He did not come.
[time=1841] First of all Jesus said, think not that I have come to destroy the law.
[time=1847] Jesus said I have not come to destroy the law and the prophets.
[time=1852] Now to that Hebrew audience who would first hear those words, the word law would conjure up several possible images or meaning in their mind.
[time=1861] Simplest of all when they heard the term law they might think of the Ten Commandments.
[time=1866] That brief statement called the Decalogue that has become the code for modern legislation, governing morality, the Ten Commandments, they're found in Exodus chapter 20 and then restated in numbers and in dude oronomy.
[time=1880] When the Hebrew mind heard the word law, it was capsulated in their mind with the Ten Commandments.
[time=1886] But there would be a second image that would come to their mind as well.
[time=1890] The phrase the law and particularly the law of Moses referred to more than just the Ten Commandments, it referred to the first five books of the Bible.
[time=1900] Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.
[time=1905] After the Hebrew they called it the Torah, we call it the Pentateuch, but that was another meaning to the word law.
[time=1912] There was a third meaning of the word law, not simply a reference to the Ten Commandments or the first five books of the Bible, but the law often referred to the entire Old Testament.
[time=1923] Particularly as in this passage when it's combined with the phrase the prophets, the law and the prophets most often signifies the entire Old Testament.
[time=1935] But there would be a fourth meaning understanding that the Hebrews would have of that word law as well.
[time=1941] That meaning is this.
[time=1943] With the Old Testament in hand, the Jewish people were always struggling to make application and interpretation of that.
[time=1954] They had their equivalent to pastors called rabbis or rabbonai.
[time=1959] A great teacher was called a rabbi.
[time=1963] These rabbis would then make running commentaries on the law.
[time=1969] The Bible says, "Thou shall not kill." Well, how do we apply that?
[time=1973] Does that mean no capital punishment?
[time=1975] Does that mean no war?
[time=1976] Does that mean you don't defend yourself?
[time=1978] Application.
[time=1980] These applications were never written down, but they were passed by strict oral tradition so that a good Jewish family would not only know what the Bible Old Testament said, but they would know what some of the leading rabbis taught concerning these regulations.
[time=1997] The experts in knowing these laws and regulations that were application of the scriptures were called scribes and Pharisees.
[time=2006] They were the religious intelligency of the day.
[time=2010] They were detailed men.
[time=2011] They knew not only the law, meaning the Old Testament, but its application.
[time=2016] About the third century, AD, this oral tradition of scribal law was written down and it's called the Mishnah.
[time=2025] Now, what has happened here is that Jesus has broken the law repeatedly.
[time=2032] Now, make this point very clear, Jesus did not break the Ten Commandments.
[time=2037] Jesus did not break the first five books of Moses, nor did Jesus break the 39 books of the Old Testament.
[time=2044] He never violated God's law, but Jesus repeatedly violated the laws of the scribes as they interpreted the scriptures.
[time=2054] Now, Matthew's gospel is not in strict criminology.
[time=2058] It does follow a chronological pattern, but it is not strictly so.
[time=2063] Matthew begins with the birth of Christ, then moves to his inauguration of public ministry with his baptism by John the baptism, and his temptation by Satan.
[time=2075] Then Jesus goes into a public ministry.
[time=2079] Later in his public ministry, after a year or so of ministry, he gives the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2086] But the Sermon on the Mount was so paramount in Jesus' teaching that Matthew took it out of criminology and placed it first in his treatment of the life of Christ, to emphasize it.
[time=2098] So there are some events that have taken place before we come to the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2103] Mark records those for us as does John.
[time=2106] In Mark chapter 2, Mark tells in verses 23 through 28 of Jesus' disciples picking grain and picking it on the Sabbath.
[time=2117] Now, the Bible says, "Honor the Sabbath and to keep it holy." How do you apply that?
[time=2124] Well, the rabbis came out with a whole system of laws, I mean pages and pages of laws to apply keeping the Sabbath.
[time=2134] They said you could go out in your field and pick enough grain to give one camel's mouthful.
[time=2139] I'm not quite sure how much that is, but that's how much they were allowed to pick.
[time=2144] Jesus' disciples now went into a field and apparently they picked more than one camel's mouthful, or else it was a very big camel.
[time=2151] Either way, the scribes and the Pharisees are greatly offended by this.
[time=2155] He has broken the law.
[time=2157] Again, not God's law, they're law.
[time=2160] Now, then Mark goes in verses 1 through 5 of chapter 3 and he tells the story of a man who had a withered hand.
[time=2169] And Jesus went up to the man, saw his pathetic condition, and healed the man.
[time=2175] And everyone was excited and praising God except the scribes and the Pharisees who looked and said, "Aha!"
[time=2182] It just went past sundown, it's the Sabbath, you shouldn't have done that.
[time=2186] You broke the law.
[time=2188] In John chapter 5, there was a man who sat by a pool, because the tradition, be it true or not, we doubt that it is,
[time=2196] was that every once in a while an angel came by and stirred the waters of this pool, and the first person to make it into the pool got healed.
[time=2204] So there would be a lot of infirm people sitting around the pool, hoping that an angel would come by, stirred the waters and they'd be the first one in.
[time=2211] Well, this one poor unfortunate soul was sitting by the pool of water, waiting for the angel to come,
[time=2217] and very frustrated because if the angel came, he couldn't get into the pool because he was lame.
[time=2222] And Jesus healed him.
[time=2224] Again, the people praised God for the blessing.
[time=2228] But they said, "You shouldn't have done that. Jesus, this is the Sabbath." You violated God's law.
[time=2235] Jesus didn't violate God's law.
[time=2237] Jesus honored the Sabbath.
[time=2239] It was their tradition that said you couldn't heal on the Sabbath.
[time=2243] Now, I'm not prone to do this, but this past week I went to the library and found a copy of the Mishnah.
[time=2251] Don't wait for it to come out as a movie. It won't make it.
[time=2255] It's not the most exciting literature.
[time=2257] But I was trying to understand how these ancient minds were working and how they could be so upset.
[time=2263] Here are some of the laws that they had passed as it related to the keeping of the Sabbath and healing.
[time=2270] One rabbi said, "If a man's teeth pain him, he may not suck vinegar," which doesn't sound like it would help your teeth a whole lot anyway.
[time=2280] I'm not going to take any of these prescriptions home with me, by the way.
[time=2284] But apparently they thought there was some medicinal effect to that.
[time=2288] If a man's teeth pain him, he may not suck vinegar through them.
[time=2293] But he may take vinegar after his usual fashion, and if he is healed, he's healed.
[time=2299] Now, what they were saying is this, "If on the day before the Sabbath, you set out food to eat on the Sabbath, and vinegar happened to be a part of what you planned, and you sucked vinegar because it was in your plan diet, and you were healed great."
[time=2312] But if you did not set vinegar out to be eaten the next day, you could not go to the shelf and get any out and suck it,
[time=2319] because that would be healing on the Sabbath, and this is the Sabbath.
[time=2323] You think that's bizarre? Listen to this one.
[time=2326] "If a man has a pain in his throat, they may drop medicine into his mouth on the Sabbath since there is doubt whether he may live.
[time=2336] If he is not in danger of death, they may not put water in his mouth." Now, what that means is if you start to cough and to gag, and you start to turn various shades of red and blue, then we can give you some water.
[time=2350] However, if it just looks like you're going to suffer for the next 24 hours, you can't have water. That's work.
[time=2357] Now, this is tragic.
[time=2361] "They may not straighten a deformed child's body or set a broken limb.
[time=2367] If a man's hand or foot is dislocated, he may not pour cold water over it, but he may wash himself after his usual fashion, and if he is healed, he is healed."
[time=2379] That means if you fell today and you injured your ankle, either breaking and tearing legaments, but in some way needed to bathe that in cold water to shrink the swelling and ease the pain, you couldn't do that.
[time=2394] Unless it was just a part of a normal bath, and if you happened to get cold water in your normal bath and that healed you, well, that's fine, but otherwise you can't do that.
[time=2403] You can't even set a dislocated finger of your child's on the Sabbath.
[time=2409] Now, this was not God's intention.
[time=2413] These were laws that the religious leaders of their day, out of sincerity of heart, had passed so as to tell people how they could apply the Sabbath.
[time=2424] In walked Jesus into their religious arena, and immediately begins to break their traditional laws.
[time=2432] And a misconception grew up that Jesus was coming, and the purpose of his coming was to abolish the Old Testament law.
[time=2441] After all, he healed on the Sabbath. After all, his disciples picked up grain.
[time=2445] As a matter of fact, I saw some of his disciples eat without washing their hands.
[time=2450] You could imagine what those people had done if they had seen our kids, but they were greatly offended by all this.
[time=2456] They were breaking all the laws, so they said, "He's just throwing out all law." And Jesus was saying, "No, don't think for a moment that I am coming to destroy the law and the prophets."
[time=2471] Interesting that he would use that phrase and the prophets so that people would know now that he's referring to the Old Testament, but not to the rabbinical teachings.
[time=2479] He said, "I'm not coming to wipe away the law.
[time=2483] As a matter of fact, heaven and earth are all going to pass away.
[time=2487] Do we dissolve, done in, forever gone?
[time=2490] But my word will not pass away, down to the jot and the tittle." Now we've talked about this in our Sunday night services, but let me repeat it for those who were not a part of that service.
[time=2502] A jot, or a yod, is the smallest letter in Hebrew. It's just kind of a little squiggly mark like an eye in our English alphabet.
[time=2511] Jesus said, "Not one small letter, not even the smallest letter of God's law is going to be altered, changed, done away with, none of it."
[time=2521] And then he went even a step further and he said, "Not only is not one letter, but going to change not one tittle."
[time=2527] A tittle is a part of a letter and a very, very small part of a letter.
[time=2533] It distinguishes Hebrew's letters, one from another, like a dollop from a bathe or something like that, but let me give you an English example.
[time=2540] Picture in your mind a capital F. Can you do that? A printed F, not a scripted F, but a printed F.
[time=2547] If you're like me, you just need to think back to some of your homework that you got back from your teacher, and you can picture that F.
[time=2553] Okay, now you've got that picture. Now, mentally picture in your mind next to it a capital E. Can you do that?
[time=2560] Capital E next to a capital F. There's not much difference, is there? Both of them have a vertical bar there, and they both have a horizontal bar at the top, and then another horizontal bar in the middle.
[time=2572] But the F doesn't have one at the bottom, and the E does. It just has kind of a little line. That's what a tittle is.
[time=2580] Jesus said not only is my word going to endure, down to detail, this word is accurate, it is God's word, it is infallible, it is inherent, it is to be believed, it is to be obeyed, and not any of it's going to change.
[time=2592] I have not come to change to alter or to abolish God's law. Don't ever be confused about that.
[time=2600] Then he goes on and makes applications so that this doesn't all stay academic.
[time=2606] He said as a matter of fact, verse 19, "Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments."
[time=2614] Let's be honest, we do something that God does not do, and that is we say this commandment is more important than this commandment.
[time=2621] For example, the Scripture says, "Thou shall not commit murder." The Scripture says, "Thou shall not trespass." In my opinion, if you're going to choose between murdering me or trespassing, cut through my yard any day.
[time=2635] But Jesus was saying God's law is a unit, it is like a chain, and you cannot break the least of these commandments.
[time=2644] Not the least of them, the most minute, the most insignificant, the most incidental that it appears to us to be is significant to God, and you cannot break one of them.
[time=2655] And even more precarious, woe unto anyone who teaches someone else that they're free to break one of them.
[time=2666] James put it this way, "Whosoever shall keep the whole law."
[time=2673] But a fend at one point is guilty of it all. That means today that if you or I have done the least infraction of God's law, we're guilty of murder, we're guilty of stealing, we're guilty of adultery, we're guilty of blasphemy.
[time=2691] Because you see God's law is a unit that represents his standard of righteousness and holiness, and if we break it at one point, it's broken.
[time=2701] I often say by way of illustration for our evangelism classes, if you are being suspended above a dangerous cliff by a chain, and someone is at the other end of that chain, pulling you up, rescuing you, how many links in that chain have to break before you're gone?
[time=2719] One, God's law is a moral chain that demands perfection, and if we cut it at any point, it is broken.
[time=2728] Jesus said, "Don't think that I'm come to destroy the law." As a matter of fact, He said, " Secondly, I'm come to fulfill it." Before we go into that fulfillment, though, can I just make a few practical sides?
[time=2741] I think there's some lessons for us to learn from these well-intending but errant Pharisees and scribes.
[time=2748] I know that it is impossible for me to operate my home for you to operate yours without some type of structure.
[time=2757] We can't organize a church without some types of rules.
[time=2761] We can't run a Christian school without some type of guidelines, but before you make some guidelines, I think there's important things that we need to learn as parents and administrators.
[time=2772] First of all, we need to learn this. Rules cannot bring anyone to Christ.
[time=2780] With the Old Testament law being the direct reflection of what God said, those rules still could not bring anyone to Christ.
[time=2788] Paul said in Galatians the third chapter that the law simply was given to show us our sinfulness so that we would see our need for Christ,
[time=2798] but by the deeds of the flesh shall no one be justified.
[time=2803] No matter how many laws, no matter how good they are, no matter how much we try to use those to channel people in the appropriate direction,
[time=2810] rules will never bring anyone to Christ.
[time=2814] Secondly, don't make so many rules that you miss God's intended desire.
[time=2822] Let me illustrate this out of Mark 7. The Old Testament law said that a father should turn to a son in a time of financial need,
[time=2832] that as a grown man, if my father had need, that he should come to me and I'm responsible by the law to provide for him.
[time=2840] So fathers were coming to their sons in days of need and their sons were giving as their father had need,
[time=2847] but because some of them were selfish, they were trying to find a way around it.
[time=2852] And so the rabbi said, "Now, anything that you dedicate to God has to stay for God's use only. You can't give that away."
[time=2861] So here would come this poor, tired Hebrew father coming up the equivalent to the sidewalk to a son's home.
[time=2869] His son would see his father coming, knowing of his destitute situation, run over the door, and they had a word called kobon.
[time=2876] And that was saying dedicated to God. And the son would look around in the house and he'd say to the sofa, kobon, to the refrigerator, kobon.
[time=2883] You know, he just pronounced everything dedicated to God. He'd open the door and say, "Oh father, I haven't seen you for such a long time.
[time=2889] You should come more often." Son, your mother and I have needs.
[time=2893] "Oh father, I wish you would have come earlier. I just dedicated everything to God and I can't give you a thing."
[time=2902] You see, they had passed so many little legislation, little laws, that it began to represent the IRS.
[time=2909] And there were loopholes, and there were ways of getting around it.
[time=2914] And through their many, many laws, they completely missed God's desire.
[time=2920] You know, we can make so many rules and so many laws that we miss God's intention.
[time=2927] If you want to breed rebellion in your children, make up a lot of rules.
[time=2935] And then when they ask you why, and I'll guarantee you, they will ask you why, give them this answer, because I said so.
[time=2945] Guarantee, it'll breed rebellion in your children.
[time=2948] And if you're like most of us, you'll say, "See, that's why we've got these rules and you'll pass a few more.
[time=2954] That's why I'll not ask why anymore." Guarantee, they won't keep it, but we can pass them.
[time=2961] You see, rules are fine, but the whole purpose of a rule is to teach a principle.
[time=2967] And when we ask the question why, are we here that if we teach them the principle to understand the rule,
[time=2974] if we only teach them that we're in charge here, and they do it because we said so, then we're breeding rebellion, and we're fulfilling exactly what Paul warned us against when he said,
[time=2985] "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath." We can bury our kids in our rules.
[time=2992] And I say that realizing my kids are right now at the stage where they're beginning to ask why to everything.
[time=2999] Put on your pajamas. Why? Because we're going to bed. Why? Because it's late. Why? Because the sun went down, just gold.
[time=3007] Oh, you know, I mean, and I'm going to pass a lot, says after nine o'clock you can't ask any questions.
[time=3016] That's nine in the morning, by the way.
[time=3019] The rules aren't going to help if we fail to teach the principle that's behind him.
[time=3026] But if we've got our finger on the principle, then the rule makes sense.
[time=3030] That's what happened in Israel. They just had volumes of laws that no one could keep track of, and nobody knew why.
[time=3036] Another practical application of this, if I may.
[time=3041] Don't judge someone else when they break your rules.
[time=3047] I've got a lot of rules. There are a lot of things that I like and a lot of things that I don't like.
[time=3053] And I know I'm right because if I wasn't, I'd change my mind. Have you heard that before?
[time=3059] And I expect you to live by my rules. That isn't fair.
[time=3065] And it isn't fair for you to expect the guy next to you to live by your rules.
[time=3070] That's what these guys had done. They'd passed all these rules, and they said now all of Israel, you're supposed to live by him.
[time=3076] Because we said so. He don't judge someone else by your rules.
[time=3081] Also, don't judge someone else if they happen to have more rules than you do.
[time=3086] See, there's a group of people who sit on one side and say, "Huh, look at those people." They shouldn't do this. They shouldn't do this. They didn't do this.
[time=3095] There's a group of people over there who said, "Look at those people." They got all these rules. They're legalists. They're fair, sake. You don't judge each other.
[time=3105] Final application.
[time=3108] Of the task of rulemaking, there is no end.
[time=3114] As soon as you set down the rule, someone's going to find an exception, and you're going to have to pass a rule called exception 101.
[time=3123] If you ever think you're going to legislate spirituality by rules, you fail to understand what Jesus was saying, what he was up against.
[time=3133] I'm not standing here saying no rules, no curfew, no restrictions.
[time=3137] That's not what I'm saying. I'm for all of them.
[time=3140] As long as there's a principle behind it, and we're consistent in teaching the principle.
[time=3145] Jesus said, "Think not that I've come to destroy it." Secondly, He said, "I'm come to fulfill it." Jesus said, "I'm come to fulfill the law and the prophets." He fulfilled the prophets because they gave futuristic predictions of the Messiah that would come.
[time=3161] Jesus fulfilled the law and the prophets in His birth, in His life, and in His death.
[time=3166] Micah the prophet said the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=3169] Matthew tells us Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
[time=3172] Isaiah said He would be born of a virgin.
[time=3175] Matthew tells us He was born of a virgin. His birth fulfilled prophecy.
[time=3180] His life fulfilled prophecy. His death.
[time=3184] Psalm 22 gave graphic description 1,000 years before the birth of Christ of His suffering and of His agony down to the detail of the piercing of His hands and His feet and His side. No bones broke and His tongue cleaving to His jaw.
[time=3198] His shoulders being dislocated. Gocker standing and mocking.
[time=3202] Garment being ripped and parted.
[time=3206] The Scripture gave prophecy. Jesus fulfilled them.
[time=3210] It was God's way of saying, "This is my son and the world recognized him." John, on his first acquaintance, said, "Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world."
[time=3220] Jesus fulfilled the prophets. But Jesus also fulfilled the law.
[time=3225] What you see, the law had is its ultimate standard, total perfection.
[time=3230] Absolute holiness. Leviticus 11, 44. It's repeated in 1 Peter 1, 15 and 16.
[time=3237] The Bible says, "Be ye therefore holy." Holy. Absolute moral perfection was the demand of God's law.
[time=3248] And apart from that, no one would see God.
[time=3252] Jesus reiterates that here. He said, "Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes
[time=3258] and the Pharisees, you won't see God." Now we look back 2,000 years and we say, "Oh, the scribes and the Pharisees, those are the dirty guys." Now in those days, those were the best of people. These were the moralists, the traditionalists, the people who were part of the conservative coalition.
[time=3275] They were looked up to and respected. They were as good as people got.
[time=3279] And Jesus said, "Unless you're better than that, you're not going to make it." God's standard was perfection. Holiness.
[time=3287] Jesus fulfilled the law because He was the only one to ever live up to the demands of a righteous God
[time=3295] that His people be righteous and holy. Jesus fulfilled that law.
[time=3299] Secondly, the law demanded death as the only payment for sin.
[time=3305] God said, "Adam, you see this garden? Man, it's all yours. You can have it. You can do whatever you want with it.
[time=3310] Just that one tree over there. Don't eat it because the day you eat thereof, thou shalt surely die."
[time=3318] Old Testament says, "The soul that sins it shall die." The New Testament says, "The wages of sin is death." Jesus fulfilled the law because He died for our sins.
[time=3330] He who knew no sin became sin for us. Jesus fulfilled the law by dying for us.
[time=3337] Thirdly, the law allowed for a substitute, a sacrifice.
[time=3342] The Old Testament animal sacrifice never took away sin. It was just a temporary covering.
[time=3348] And told the Messiah would come who would die and take away the sins of the world. Jesus fulfilled the law's righteous demand of sacrifice.
[time=3356] That is why He has come.
[time=3359] He came because the law demanded perfection. He provided holy perfection.
[time=3364] The law demanded death. He provided death.
[time=3367] The law provided for a substitute. Jesus became the substitute for our sins.
[time=3373] The law says that we must be righteous, and now Jesus takes us, washes our sin, and then clothes us in His righteousness.
[time=3381] Jesus came to give us His righteousness.
[time=3387] God's Christmas gift.
[time=3390] His Son who came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.
[time=3395] To fulfill it by dying for our sins.
[time=3398] Have you today received Christ as your Savior?
[time=3402] I pray that you have this Christmas.
[time=3406] How can it be Christmas without Christ?
[time=3410] And where can Christ be but in your heart?
[time=3414] Have you opened up your heart to Him?

[time=3429] Take over my heart and give me eternal life.
