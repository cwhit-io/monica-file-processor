[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Good evening my name is Rick Hawks and it's my privilege to pastor the Blackhawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=48] And each week we bring the Bible hour through television into the homes of many people here in Fort Wayne and starting this Sunday into your community in South Bend.
[time=58] What a privilege it is for us to share God's love and God's Word with you.
[time=64] Each week our broadcast is an hour long service that is actually our morning worship service where our choir and our musicians will bring to you praise in the form of music to God.
[time=74] And then you and I'll have the opportunity to study God's Word together as we open up the scriptures each week to look at depth at what God's Word has to say.
[time=84] And most importantly how you and I can have a personal relationship with Christ through the living Savior.
[time=90] The Bible hour will be beginning today and be each week at six o'clock here on Channel 46.
[time=96] We want you to stay with us for this next hour and invite friends to join us each Sunday at this time.
[time=104] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=116] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour.
[time=124] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists and a message from God's Word with pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=132] Join us won't you for the Bible hour.
[time=136] So, I sing the glory, I'll break the horn, I'll break the horn, it sings my soul, I'll sing the glory, I'll break the horn, I'll break the horn.
[time=166] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=174] Today is our first Sunday after the living Christmas tree.
[time=180] We've had the joy through the living Christmas tree of sharing Christ with our community through the 15 concerts and the Sunday morning services and the broadcasting of the Bible hour when we had the tree here.
[time=192] What a joyous time it was and I enjoyed every moment and I trust that you did too.
[time=198] But this morning it's somewhat of a good feeling to me to return to normal, whatever normal is.
[time=204] I'm not quite sure that this church has ever discovered normal, but today we're moving back towards a routine.
[time=210] This Sunday we give the choir a little well-deserved rest after 15 concerts, but we've come today to worship and to praise the Lord together.
[time=218] I like the routines, I know someone said that you want to be careful not to get into a rut and into a routine, but you know there's some good parts to having traditions and being regular and today we start back into that regular cycle.
[time=234] And I hope as you're a part of this church that you'll become routine in your service of the Lord and in our worship together, we're so thankful you've come today and we want to welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible hour, not only here in Fort Wayne.
[time=248] But today's broadcast marks our first broadcast in the city of South Bend for many years and so it's really a joy for us to welcome our viewers in South Bend who are joining us today to worship the Lord together.
[time=260] Mr. Bob Benetta sang a song that very aptly spoke of our personal response to the Lord's gift of his son at Christmas of giving ourself all of our selves to him.
[time=272] We've asked Bob to sing that by way of ministry this morning. Bob Benetta.
[time=290] [MUSIC]
[time=296] Now, dear Lord, I give you this gift today.
[time=304] This song I sing, this love I bring to you.
[time=314] Every candle burning to show the way to the Christ child, the manger, the hay.
[time=332] Every tree that stands tall must point to you, and every bow must peel out and true.
[time=350] Every child must praise your precious name, multitudes of angels the same.
[time=368] So dear Lord, I give you this gift today by every celebration for you.
[time=386] All wrapped up with ribbons and lots of love.
[time=394] Everything, it all belongs to you, everything, it all belongs to you.
[time=420] Thank you, Bob, for that ministry of music.
[time=424] We've been singing for weeks now the birth of the Savior and the fact that we can look to Jesus for that personal salvation because of his coming to earth and death and resurrection.
[time=434] That's the message we have today. Look and live, my brother live, look to Jesus now and live, him number 360. Let us sing together, him number 360.
[time=450] Lord, I give you this gift today by every celebration for you. I give you this gift today by every celebration for you.
[time=464] Look and live, my brother live, look to Jesus now and live, him number 360.
[time=480] Only that you look and live. I give you this gift today by every celebration for you.
[time=494] Please, the message from above of the million, Jesus said that I know it is true.
[time=502] Look and live, my brother live, look to Jesus now and live, him number 360.
[time=524] On that 4th stanza, I will tell you my name.
[time=528] I believe my brother live, unto Jesus now and live.
[time=552] And it is only that you grow and live.
[time=566] An angel many years ago announced God's son and his name was Jesus. This was one of the many names that was given to our Savior.
[time=574] The Bible says, "Therefore God hath highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name above every name."
[time=580] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=592] For there is no other name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved."
[time=598] Listen to the quartet now, actually a trio this morning as they sing, the men singers sing a song entitled, "Jesus Name Above All Names."
[time=608] And his name shall be above all names.
[time=626] Wonderful the mighty Prince of Peace, born in Bethlehem on this Christmas day.
[time=638] Jesus name of names to me.
[time=652] Jesus, what a lovely name Jesus, let all earth proclaim Jesus.
[time=668] Bright and morning star, holy shepherds worshiped in mighty, wise men trusted in Jesus name of names to me.
[time=696] He is the way, the truth, the life, God's only son the way I am.
[time=714] Glory and honor, Majesty begin Jesus name of names to me.
[time=734] Jesus, what a lovely name Jesus, let all earth proclaim Jesus.
[time=750] Bright and morning star, holy shepherds worshiped in mighty, wise men trusted in Jesus name of names to me.
[time=778] Jesus, what a lovely name Jesus, let all earth proclaim Jesus.
[time=798] Bright and morning star, holy shepherds worshiped in mighty, wise men trusted in Jesus name of names to me.
[time=826] Jesus, born on Christmas day.
[time=848] Today is the last broadcast for the year 1984, here in Fort Wayne, and it's the first broadcast in South Bend for the year 1985.
[time=858] As we come to you friends who are in South Bend we run the Bible all our two week delay so we have time to get the tape process and taken to South Bend.
[time=868] And it's such a joy for us after nearly two and a half years to be able to return to the community of South Bend and share the ministry of God's Word and the ministry of music with you.
[time=878] We hope that all of you in South Bend will make a habit of joining us for the Bible hour and you may if you would encourage your friends to join us as they may not have gotten the news yet that we're back broadcasting God's Word in your community.
[time=890] This has been a very busy time for all of us but particularly for Pete with the Living Christmas Tree but it's over.
[time=896] We just had a great time performing the 15 concerts of the Living Christmas Tree this year seemed like everything went very smoothly and I guess it was a delight too to see all of the Bible hour listeners that came to the various concerts.
[time=910] And the last thing that I could say is that we were talking about a Savior, a living Savior that has come to give us, if any of us, be in Christ we are new creatures and old things are passed away.
[time=920] And then I was reading in 1 Peter this morning of a living hope and that's what we sang about for the last couple weeks of the Savior that was born and then eventually died and rose again for our sins and for the sins of everyone in this world.
[time=934] And that was the message of hope that we brought in the last two weeks and we certainly were privileged to do that.
[time=938] You know, Pete, it's such a joy too to hear from people what that performance meant in their lives.
[time=944] Kevin Rowe who sings here at the church and is known to some of the people on the Bible who watched regularly was over at our house the other night and we've known Kevin for quite a few years.
[time=954] And we just said, "Kevin, we don't know how it is that you originally came to Christ." And he said, "Well, a friend invited me to the Living Christmas Tree and I started coming to church as a result of that.
[time=966] Some people from Black Hawk visited my home and I accepted Christ." We had so many opportunities and comments like that, a 12 year old girl accepted Christ as a personal Savior a year ago at the Living Christmas Tree and her mother wrote this year to tell us that the Living Christmas Tree and the message was the influence in her life that changed her life and she was a different person a year later.
[time=988] Well, that's always exciting and we hear those same reports about the Bible hour reaching into homes and hospitals and sharing the love of Christ.
[time=996] It means so much to us when you come to the tree or we meet you at the mall or somewhere and you tell us personally that you've seen the Bible hour and it's been a ministry in your life.
[time=1006] We really appreciate that.
[time=1008] One final thing that we'd like to share with you in these brief moments away from our live morning worship service is the ministry of timeless insights.
[time=1016] Timeless Insights is a daily Bible study tool that we want to share with you.
[time=1022] This tool will take you through the entire New Testament in a systematic reading in one calendar year.
[time=1030] Now today for you friends here in Fort Wayne were just about two days from the beginning of the new year.
[time=1036] If you're like me you make New Year's resolutions and one of those ought to be to be a consistent faithful student of God's Word.
[time=1044] None of us can live spiritually off of the food that is being served to us once a week in church or through a broadcast.
[time=1052] We need to make it our habit like the Word encourages us to search the Scriptures and to discover the truth of God's Word.
[time=1060] This tool will help you to do that and we want to send it to you. Its format is rather simple.
[time=1064] It gives you a passage of Scripture to read for each day.
[time=1068] Then it takes you into history with a timeless insight.
[time=1072] Some great Christian writers insight into the passage you've just read is shared.
[time=1078] And then most importantly a timely response, how you can apply God's Word to your life.
[time=1082] And we want to send this to you to help you become a faithful student of God's Word.
[time=1088] Pete, would you tell our friends how they can receive their copy?
[time=1090] Yes, we'd like to encourage you to write to the Bible Hour box 15,000
[time=1096] Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1100] Write for timeless insights to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1108] Again, we want to thank you for your faithfulness during the year 1984.
[time=1114] God has truly blessed us. He's encouraged our hearts.
[time=1118] And your warmth and your response has been such a joy to us.
[time=1122] If you have the time, we would greatly appreciate a note or a letter that lets us know that you're watching.
[time=1128] Quite often at like at a wedding yesterday, Pete someone says, "Well, I know you.
[time=1132] I watch you every Sunday and I just jokingly tell them, "Well, our cameras don't give us a good image of you, so I don't recognize you." We don't get to meet you, see you.
[time=1140] So if you would just drop us a note, that helps us to know you're there.
[time=1144] Particularly on this first day of broadcasting in South Bend, we'd love to know that you're there and watching.
[time=1150] Now we're going to go back to our morning worship service with the prayer in our heart that God will use this to strengthen your faith in Christ.

[time=1363] Jeannie, that was tremendous.
[time=1364] She not only played that, but she arranged those two hymns.
[time=1368] How majestic is thy name, O Lord, and O come, all you faithful.
[time=1372] Jeannie, we so appreciate your ministry week by week.
[time=1375] To hear a piano play, and not to hear a voice, gives us opportunity in our own minds to let those words come from within.
[time=1383] And I didn't sing it out loud, but today there was within my own heart.
[time=1386] And I trust within yours a song that says, oh, Lord, how our Lord, how majestic is thy name over all the earth.
[time=1394] O come, let us adore him.
[time=1397] Our Father, today, our hearts ring out with that truth that you are our God.
[time=1403] And your name is majestic, that your name is a name that is above every name.
[time=1408] And God, today, we've come to worship you, and we've come to ascribe to you all power, all glory, all honor, all praise.
[time=1416] Father, today, we give thanks unto you for your goodness and to us.
[time=1420] Father, we would ask today that your spirit would assist us as we give praise unto your name.
[time=1426] We ask that you would cleanse our heart, that we might meet today and assemble in this place to study your word with clean hands and a pure heart.
[time=1436] O God, today, may we sense the cleansing that is available through the Lord Jesus.
[time=1442] Father, we would pray today that everything that happens in our auditorium and in the walls of our hearts would be of pleasing and honoring character to you.
[time=1454] Father, we had also asked that as we worship you today, there would come a restoration of our own hearts that as we've labored this week, that we might be restored and renewed and refreshed.
[time=1466] Father, may there be to our own hearts a quenching of the thirsting that we have for God.
[time=1472] May we find in our satisfaction of God that every need that we have falls into perspective.
[time=1479] God, today, we would ask you to minister particularly to the one who labors in life alone, who's lost loved ones in recent days and months.
[time=1489] To be to them, the partner that they've lost so that they might not know aloneness because the Spirit of God is their comforter.
[time=1498] God, we would pray today for those who are of broken hearts
[time=1504] because of a broken relationship.
[time=1506] That you today would give them the grace to wait upon a spouse that is unfaithful, gone,
[time=1519] betrayed them.
[time=1521] God, give to that heart today the ability to be faithful when they have not found their spouse to be so.
[time=1529] God, today, we pray for that one who labors as a parent alone, that you would give to them extra grace and strength.
[time=1537] We'd pray for families today whose loved ones are suffering.
[time=1541] We'd pray today that you would bring about healing and recovery in the lives of the beloved Mary Lantman, Phyllis Hopkins, Judy Dabel, Pat McIntosh, Lois Welliver.
[time=1556] God, our heart could go on with the list of names.
[time=1558] And yet, today, God, we're aware that you intimately know their needs and their names better than we.
[time=1565] We ask you to give to their families grace and strength for the ordeal.
[time=1569] Father, may your word today speak to our hearts, give us wisdom, insight.
[time=1575] God, may your Spirit give us the courage and the strength to obey that which we know, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1582] [AMEN] A grown daughter and her father were having a confrontation.
[time=1591] Her life was a tragic mess.
[time=1595] It was her fault, choices that she had made.
[time=1600] As to be expected, the father said, see, we told you this would happen.
[time=1606] Didn't we raise you better than this?
[time=1609] I mean, didn't we always take you to the right places and come to your school plays and support you in every way?
[time=1616] And we always told you, we loved you, and we raised you better than this.
[time=1623] In every statement the father would make.
[time=1626] The daughter would nod in agreement that the parental upbringing was appropriate.
[time=1630] The structure was good.
[time=1632] The rules were adequate.
[time=1633] The guidance was there.
[time=1636] And finally, the father in exhaustion gave up and reciting all the things that he had done right.
[time=1643] And the daughter said, dad, you did everything right.
[time=1646] And that was the problem.
[time=1648] Everything with you was right.
[time=1650] You always said the right thing.
[time=1652] You always had the right look on your face.
[time=1654] You always showed up at the right time.
[time=1656] You were always right, dad.
[time=1658] You were never wrong.
[time=1661] You were dead, it was so mechanical I couldn't take it anymore.
[time=1667] Do you know that it's possible to be right and to be wrong?
[time=1674] It's very, very possible for us to be right and to be absolutely wrong.
[time=1682] That was the spiritual condition of Israel in the times of Jesus.
[time=1686] They were right.
[time=1688] They had the law.
[time=1689] It was right.
[time=1690] They obeyed it.
[time=1690] They were right.
[time=1693] But they were all wrong because it was so mechanical.
[time=1699] It was so rigid.
[time=1701] It was so void of meaning and heart.
[time=1706] Jesus attacked that problem head on.
[time=1712] Six times in Matthew's gospel, the fifth chapter, Jesus uses an expression.
[time=1717] He said, you have heard it said.
[time=1720] But I say unto you.
[time=1723] Each time he says, you have heard it said, and he quotes that which is right.
[time=1728] Usually it's from the Old Testament, the Ten Commandments.
[time=1732] He wasn't saying what you have heard is wrong, but he's saying how you've applied it and how you've lived it is wrong.
[time=1740] You have heard it said, but I say unto you.
[time=1744] It was Jesus' way of getting them to understand that paramount statement he made in Matthew 5.20.
[time=1751] Jesus said, unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=1757] Now in our mind we say, hey, those are the bad guys.
[time=1759] Those are the guys that crucified Jesus.
[time=1762] Those are the guys that oppressed the disciples as they declared the resurrection.
[time=1767] That's true from our vantage point.
[time=1769] But back when Jesus was speaking, the Pharisees were the absolute good guys.
[time=1776] They were the people that no one thought they could outdo.
[time=1780] And Jesus said, unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will in no way see the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1791] Now what Jesus was not saying necessarily is you've got to be more righteous, but you've got to have righteousness of a different kind.
[time=1799] And to try to get them to see that, he is going to say six times, you have heard it said, but I say unto you, what Jesus was doing is he was diagnosing the heart of men and women.
[time=1811] Behavior takes on three forms.
[time=1816] The most obvious form of behavior is our action, what we do.
[time=1821] But there's a second level of behavior below that.
[time=1826] That is the level of our words.
[time=1829] Have you ever noticed that it's very possible for your children to be doing exactly what you've told them to do and the whole way they're complaining, they're muttering, they're refusing to do it as they're doing it.
[time=1840] My father had such a son when it came to mowing the yard.
[time=1845] He would say, go mow the yard.
[time=1849] I've told you, it has to be done by Saturday.
[time=1850] It's four o'clock Saturday and I would plot out there to mow the yard complaining about everything.
[time=1856] The injustice of our home that every week I am expected to spend a whole hour out of this week to cut the grass and my sister didn't have to cut the grass and I wanted, oh I was cutting it but you could hear me complaining above the three horsepower motor.
[time=1871] You see that's also a level of behavior.
[time=1876] But even below that there's a level of behavior that goes deeper than our actions, that goes deeper than our words, it's our very attitudes.
[time=1884] That's the rock bottom level of behavior.
[time=1886] And it's very possible for us to be doing exactly what we're supposed to be doing in our action and to be doing exactly what we're supposed to be doing with our words, never saying a thing but our attitude is way off.
[time=1900] We often use the word emoting to describe that.
[time=1907] You know, sometimes we communicate best don't we when we don't say a thing.
[time=1911] One of the Wendy's commercials shows this little sweet old
[time=1917] lady who's famous for saying, where's the beef?
[time=1919] In the backseat of a big car.
[time=1921] And every time it turns a corner she gets thrown from side to side.
[time=1925] A friend was explaining that she knows when her husband's mad because he doesn't say a thing but he's upset that she's late.
[time=1931] She gets in the car and every corner she gets thrown against the outside wall and they turn the next corner and thrown back and no one says a word but it's very subtle.
[time=1941] I am upset.
[time=1943] Please don't check my wife's elbows for bruises.
[time=1949] That's attitude, we didn't say a thing.
[time=1952] But on a cool day you can see the steam coming out of our ears.
[time=1957] That's the level of behavior that's at the bottom of it.
[time=1963] And Jesus is going to say, you've heard it said and you've got it right on the actions but get deeper into behavior and you've got it all wrong.
[time=1974] Matthew 5, 21.
[time=1978] You have heard that it was said by them of old.
[time=1981] He's now quoting the Old Testament.
[time=1983] Exodus chapter 20 verse three begins the 10 commandments.
[time=1987] You have heard it said by them of old, "Thou shall not kill and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment." But I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother
[time=2003] without a cause shall be in danger of judgment.
[time=2007] And whosoever shall say to his brother Reka shall be in danger of the council.
[time=2014] And whosoever shall say to his brother, fool thou fool shall be in danger of hellfire.
[time=2022] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar
[time=2029] and there remembers that thy brother have odd against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother then come and offer thy gift.
[time=2042] Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him.
[time=2048] Lest at any time the adversary delivered thee to the judge and the judge delivered thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison.
[time=2057] Verily I say unto thee, thou shall by no means come out from there till thou hast paid the uttermost farling.
[time=2067] Thou hast heard it said, the law, regulated actions of behavior and it was right.
[time=2075] And here were a whole group of people that knew the law and diligently kept the law were faithful to it and their actions were absolutely appropriate and Jesus pointed in the dieting finger at them and said, but I say unto you.
[time=2093] And he takes and he applies the law not in its letter but in its spirit to every level of behavior actions, words and attitudes alike.
[time=2104] Basically Jesus I say unto you two things, not just don't kill but I say unto you first of all don't get angry and secondly don't verbally assault anyone.
[time=2117] Let's slow down and look at those two statements.
[time=2121] Jesus said I say unto you whoever is angry with his brother.
[time=2126] There are two words in the Greek New Testament that are most often used to describe anger.
[time=2133] The first is the word thumos from which we get thermal which means heat.
[time=2139] Thumos means a sudden burst of flame.
[time=2142] I don't know whether you've ever made the same mistake that I have of deciding you're gonna get rid of your Christmas tree the easy way, you'll burn it, don't do it, this isn't in the text, this is just kind of advice off the side.
[time=2154] You light that dry pine tree and it will go up instantly and ablaze the flame.
[time=2161] As I lit that I thought the whole city suddenly caught on fire, I thought the world was ending but before I could even react the fire was over.
[time=2171] That's characteristic of some anger.
[time=2175] Sometimes our anger explodes out of us like an impulse into a burning flame almost instantly as we're upset as though the whole world was about to end.
[time=2183] It's usually over something very significant as who stole the last brush in my house.
[time=2190] And we explode with great flame but then usually we die down just as quick.
[time=2196] There's a second word for anger which is the word or gay.
[time=2201] This word does not mean that impetuous, impulsive bursting of emotion.
[time=2206] This means the slow burn.
[time=2208] This is the fire that has been accumulating fuel
[time=2214] for some period of time now and stacking it all in the neat place.
[time=2218] And then when that final straw that broke the camel's back is placed into the heap, it is ignited into a huge flame and it burns long and hot.
[time=2231] It actually is the type of fire that you have to keep kindling to keep it going.
[time=2236] One New Testament commentator put it this way.
[time=2242] It's a long-lived angered, harbored resentment.
[time=2247] The anger that needs nursed along so that it's remembered so that it's fresh and alive.
[time=2255] It's the anger that we rehearse in our minds.
[time=2258] No, there are so many times that as we describe our hurts
[time=2265] we've rehearsed them and we've rehearsed them and we've rehearsed them.
[time=2269] And so that as we share that hurt, it is as though it happened yesterday, but it was four and it was five and 10 years old.
[time=2279] You wanna know something else?
[time=2283] When we rehearse the stories in our mind, we tend to spice them up just a little.
[time=2290] We don't remember exactly what the person said as much as how we felt and our own feelings become a magnifying glass that expands the hurt.
[time=2303] And for years we harbor it with that anger.
[time=2306] Jesus said, don't be angry.
[time=2314] Oh, you've heard it said that if a person kills somebody, then they're in danger of judgment.
[time=2323] But Jesus said, I wanna tell you that today if you're angry, you're in danger of that exact same judgment.
[time=2331] That sounds harsh, doesn't it?
[time=2335] But it's really rather simple because you see out of the same well that springs forth murder springs forth anger.
[time=2344] If you see anger is simply the attitude that gives birth to the action.
[time=2353] Jesus said, oh, you've known the law and you wouldn't kill anybody.
[time=2357] But you walk around here with your hearts full of hate.
[time=2360] He said, you're guilty of murder and rest under the same penalty.
[time=2365] Then Jesus applied it a second way, not only to actions but to words.
[time=2371] He said, but I say unto you also that whosoever shall say to his brother Rekha shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say thou fool, shall be in danger of fire.
[time=2386] The word Rekha means empty and takes a little bit of thinking to figure out what they're exactly saying there.
[time=2392] Somebody's done something and you're upset and angry with him.
[time=2396] He just turned him and say empty.
[time=2398] What does that mean?
[time=2399] Well, the word empty probably means that you're saying to the person that you're empty up here.
[time=2406] It's when we say, I can't believe that you were so stupid that you didn't see it my way.
[time=2413] Hard to say, thou fool.
[time=2418] That's a Greek word.
[time=2420] Rekha would be an aromatic, a form of Hebrew.
[time=2423] Thou fool moray from which we get the word moron.
[time=2428] Call someone an idiot.
[time=2429] That's important that we recognize it's not so much the exact words because these Pharisees would have ran out and made a past two laws.
[time=2437] I shall not say Rekha, now shall not say fool.
[time=2439] And they had gone on calling people other things.
[time=2443] It's the idea of verbally assaulting someone with contempt.
[time=2447] Another lot of times we joke around.
[time=2451] My father and I have teased each other good naturely for years.
[time=2456] Anytime I do anything that's a little empty, he likes to say, doesn't the elevator go all the way to the top or the marbles all roll to one side?
[time=2467] That's not what the Bible's talking about.
[time=2470] A joke between two people who are bonded together and understand that relationship.
[time=2475] He's talking about that heart that becomes angry and contempt, maybe with the same person, but verbally assaults them.
[time=2484] Let's try to pull this all together.
[time=2487] I think what Jesus has said in this key verse, verse 22,
[time=2494] can be summed up in a few brief statements.
[time=2498] First of all, Jesus said, don't be angry.
[time=2500] Just don't get angry.
[time=2503] It isn't worth it.
[time=2506] It's unhealthy for you.
[time=2507] It's damaging to the other person.
[time=2509] It's ungodly.
[time=2510] It comes out of the natural spirit, not out of the spirit of God that's the brain in our heart.
[time=2514] Don't get angry.
[time=2516] I think the second thing Jesus was saying is this.
[time=2521] If you do get angry, put out the fire fast.
[time=2525] Don't nourish it.
[time=2526] Don't nurse it along.
[time=2527] Don't feed it.
[time=2529] If you do get angry and I do, it's important
[time=2535] that we don't harbor that in our heart and nurse it along.
[time=2540] And finally, I think Jesus was saying, don't get angry.
[time=2547] Secondly, if you do get upset, deal with it quickly.
[time=2550] And finally when you're angry, keep your mouth shut.
[time=2553] Now that's tough, isn't it?
[time=2558] Because our words are the most readily available weapons to us.
[time=2562] They can be picked up at a moment.
[time=2564] They're at our fingertips disposal and they're as deadly as any action we could make.
[time=2568] I believe it was William Penn who said, the pen is mightier than the sword.
[time=2575] He was right.
[time=2578] Remember that little poem used to recite when you were a child.
[time=2581] Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
[time=2585] It isn't true.
[time=2586] I've seen words destroy lives.
[time=2590] Take hearts and stomp them, crush out their life.
[time=2595] People have literally died of a broken heart from the words that have been hurled at them like deadly darts.
[time=2606] Jesus said, don't get angry.
[time=2608] Whatever you do if you are angry, keep your mouth shut.
[time=2613] No, it's amazing, the excuses that we make.
[time=2617] Well, I just have to get it out.
[time=2620] If I get it out, I'll feel so much better.
[time=2623] You know, in therapy, that's called ventilating.
[time=2627] And it may be necessarily for you to ventilate your feelings, but it's never appropriate to do that with anger.
[time=2636] No, I've observed something.
[time=2637] If you're angry and you ventilate that anger, you're gonna feel better.
[time=2642] You really are for a while.
[time=2644] And after a few days because you haven't worked through forgiveness and reconciliation with the person you're upset with, that anger is still there.
[time=2653] The fire, the fumes have just been allowed to come out, but it's still smoldering, and you'll nurse it along, and you'll put some more fuel to it, and you'll have to ventilate again, and again, and again, and again, and again.
[time=2666] (audience chattering) Doesn't help to get it out.
[time=2671] The only thing that will solve the problem is to forgive and to be restored to the party that has hurt you, and Jesus is gonna talk about that next.
[time=2682] Another great excuse we have as well.
[time=2687] That's just the way I was raised.
[time=2688] My father always did it, and I'm just a chip off the old block.
[time=2694] I don't know of a place in the Bible where God lists the appropriate behavior, and then footnotes it and says, now if you were raised differently than this, this doesn't apply to you.
[time=2703] Just because we grew up with that model
[time=2709] doesn't mean that it is appropriate for us to pass it on.
[time=2713] It becomes more appropriate for us to make sure we break the habit so that we don't pass it on to our children.
[time=2723] But the one that absolutely gets to me is the person that says, well, I know I said something, maybe I shouldn't have said it, maybe I got angry, but I just had to be honest.
[time=2734] You know, I'm just an honest person.
[time=2736] I just tell it like it is.
[time=2738] You know, that's so pious.
[time=2743] That's saying, I'm just such an honest, wonderful person that I just cannot harbor any untruth in this holy character of mine.
[time=2749] So here it comes, honey.
[time=2753] And we attack and we destroy in the name of false integrity.
[time=2758] That's not pleasing to God.
[time=2764] That's not edifying to the body, and that certainly isn't gonna help you.
[time=2768] Now honesty is indeed a virtue, but any virtue can be made a vice through misuse.
[time=2777] And that's what these people had done.
[time=2780] They'd taken every virtue of God and they'd turned it into a legalistic vice.
[time=2784] Jesus said, if you are guilty of anger,
[time=2792] if you're guilty of verbal assault, you're in guilty of murder, and you're gonna stand before the same judgment, the same counsel, and you're gonna be guilty of Gehenna Hellfire.
[time=2803] What was Gehenna?
[time=2804] The Valley of Hennon laid outside of Jerusalem.
[time=2809] It was historically significant for a number of reasons it was a place where sacrifices were made to peg in gods, but be honest with you, it was the landfill for the city of Jerusalem.
[time=2820] It's where they threw away any solid waste, and there was a continual fire that burned there to burn up the trash of the city.
[time=2828] And it was a grim reminder to them that God had a waste ground called Hell where the flame never died.
[time=2839] And that if there were those that thought because they didn't commit murder, they would escape it.
[time=2845] They were to learn that if they did not have a righteousness exceeded the Pharisees, meaning they never got angry, and they never spoke a wrong word, they're ready for that same fire.
[time=2855] They said, there's no one that's gonna pass, that's right.
[time=2860] 'Cause you see, the only way that we'll have righteousness that exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees is to receive Christ as Savior and to be forgiven, and to take on His righteousness is the only cloak.
[time=2871] Let's take a moment and look at two very practical applications
[time=2880] that Jesus made in verses 23 through 26 of all that He has just said.
[time=2885] Gives us two situations, they're different.
[time=2888] Verse 23 deals with anger and resentment that is directed towards a brother, a friend.
[time=2896] Verse 25 is one that deals with an enemy, an adversary.
[time=2901] Probably someone that you know who you've done business with but it's a strained relationship.
[time=2907] Verse 23, the situation is this.
[time=2912] You've gone to the temple, you've purchased a sacrifice, an animal that was going to be offered.
[time=2917] You literally have probably waited all day in the line as you took your animal into the temple and waited for the priest to make the sacrifice.
[time=2926] And after waiting all day, having made the trip to the temple from a distant city perhaps, in the heat of the day, you've stood there in line with this nagging animal and its cage and you finally make it to the altar.
[time=2941] You're ready to make your sacrifice and it dawns on you that somebody is upset with you.
[time=2947] Jesus had leave your gift there.
[time=2950] Wait a minute, I came all the way down here to Jerusalem.
[time=2954] Leave your gift there.
[time=2956] I've waited all day in line.
[time=2959] Leave your gift there.
[time=2960] I'm next, leave your gift there and go and be reconciled to your brother
[time=2970] and then come back and offer your gift.
[time=2974] What Jesus was saying is this, we must be reconciled
[time=2983] as the only solution for anger.
[time=2987] You can't ventilate it, you can't harbor it, you've got to be reconciled.
[time=2993] Let me give you what he says here.
[time=2997] First of all, he says to recognize, be sensitive to the tension between you and a brother.
[time=3004] And if you recognize it, then secondly be reconciled.
[time=3011] Go and do whatever it takes to bring your lives back together and have forgiveness.
[time=3019] Thirdly, then return and offer your sacrifice to the Lord.
[time=3025] And fortunately, he said, do it immediately.
[time=3032] Do it now, don't wait till tomorrow, don't wait till after the sacrifice, don't wait till you see the person, don't wait until they apologize to you.
[time=3041] Don't wait till they take the first step, do it now, do it immediately.
[time=3047] And the Old Testament, their sacrifice was an animal.
[time=3052] And the New Testament, our sacrifice is our worship, our praise, our assembling in this place to ascribe majesty to his name, by the devotion of our heart and the words of our lips.
[time=3066] That's our worship.
[time=3069] I think Jesus gives us some very important insights in the life here.
[time=3072] First insight I'd like to draw out of this is this.
[time=3077] There's no dichotomy between our religion and our relationships.
[time=3082] So often, we wanna put our religion over here and how we relate to God and our relationships over here and how we relate to people.
[time=3091] And there can be tension in this one, but this one's just fine.
[time=3094] God said, if this area isn't fine, then don't even come into this area until you fix this area up.
[time=3103] You see, the vertical relationship between God and us
[time=3112] can be impeded by our horizontal relationships
[time=3118] with each other.
[time=3119] Second insight.
[time=3125] Key phrase found in 1 Samuel 15, a soul is confronted by the prophet.
[time=3130] To obey is better than sacrifice.
[time=3135] It's far better that we obey God, restore relationships than we come to the temple and we offer any gift, or that we come to the church and we offer any money, any time, any talent, any words, any praise, any devotion, it is better to obey.
[time=3155] It is better to obey.
[time=3158] There isn't anything that we're going to do in the arena of religion that is more important than being obedient in the arena of relationships.
[time=3168] Third insight.
[time=3171] Sacrifice never negates the responsibility
[time=3178] to do all that we can to correct the problem.
[time=3184] Sacrifice never negates the responsibility to do all that we can to correct the problem.
[time=3191] I have to tell you that it gets to me when this person has hurt this person and they were wrong and they say, "Well, I've confessed it to the Lord, it's under the blood." And they've done nothing to restore to this person
[time=3211] whatever they've lost.
[time=3215] We've done something that caused somebody to lose money.
[time=3220] It's not enough that we ask God to forgive us.
[time=3224] It's not even enough that we ask them to forgive us, we pay back the money.
[time=3227] Any sacrifice, any devotion, any worship,
[time=3235] any religious act does nothing to negate our responsibility to do all that we can.
[time=3241] Sometimes there's nothing we can do.
[time=3245] But if there's something we can do, we should do it.
[time=3248] Oh, Jesus gives a second illustration.
[time=3253] This illustration, it's no longer a brother.
[time=3257] This is an adversary.
[time=3258] This is someone who you have a business deal with.
[time=3261] And Jesus' basic point is this.
[time=3263] Just solve the problem and it quickly.
[time=3268] He said, "Agree." That means be agreeable with your adversary.
[time=3274] He said, "Don't escalate it, take it to court.
[time=3277] "From court, somebody's gonna go to jail "and there's a good chance at you, "all over a misunderstanding.
[time=3281] "Just do what it takes to reconcile it." A.T. Robertson made this tremendous insight in dealing with this.
[time=3288] He said, "Compromise is better than jail "where there is no principle involved, "but only a matter of personal interest.
[time=3297] "And then this crucial insight." And it's so easy to see principle where pride is actually involved.
[time=3305] Bible says that we're to be reconciled.
[time=3308] Today, have you been reconciled to God?
[time=3311] You can't do that through religion, through duty, through anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3317] He died for your sins.
[time=3319] That's the only reconciliation we have.
[time=3322] Have you received him?
[time=3324] If not today, would you open up your heart to him?
[time=3327] I pray that you will.
[time=3328] Our God never fought.
[time=3334] We're so glad that you tuned into the Bible hour today to listen to the special music and the word of God spoken through our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3343] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now.
[time=3351] Will you pray with me?
[time=3352] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3357] I thank you for sending your son to die for my sins.
[time=3361] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3367] I ask you Jesus to come in today.
[time=3369] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3372] Let me encourage you to write us if you've made a decision and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3378] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
