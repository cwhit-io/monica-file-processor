[time=0] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=31] Good morning and welcome to the Bible.
[time=35] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, D.A.
[time=41] It's the Bible Hour, with inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists
[time=48] and a message from God's word with master requirements. Join us won't you for the Bible Hour.
[time=55] Thank you, you made me seated.
[time=60] Good morning and welcome. It is such a delight today to welcome you to our morning worship services.
[time=65] Today is a very special day because we have as our guest speaker today, Mr. Don Bartlett.
[time=71] And later on in our service we'll be introducing him to you, but we are so thankful today for the privilege we have to assemble together in this place into worship.
[time=80] And then be on our auditorium to be able to share God's word in music and in testimony through the Bible Hour.
[time=86] So to those friends who are joining us today for the Bible Hour, we want to share a special word of welcome with you as well.
[time=93] I just want to alert both of our audiences, those of you who are here in our television family that next week the Bible Hour will not be presented, will be preempted by a telethon.
[time=103] So if you're at home today watching television and you're supposed to be here, you can't watch next week, you need to come.
[time=109] And those of you who are looking at the weather and saying, well it's a little icy, maybe next Sunday when you get up, when you think about staying home, you have to come next week.
[time=116] Steve and Maria Gardner are going to be singing next week.
[time=119] We'll be returning to a message series that I'm sharing.
[time=122] The choir will be here and we want you to come that we can worship together.
[time=126] We're delighted that you've come today.
[time=128] Our purpose is to declare the name of Jesus Christ, to worship Him, to praise Him, to take His Word and the testimony of His Word and cause it to become real in each one of our hearts.
[time=139] Our choir is now going to lead us in an anthem of worship as they sing to us.
[time=143] We trust that you'll allow your heart to be an open heart that they can plant God's Word in music into it.
[time=158] We love you.
[time=260] Have you any room for Jesus as in grace He calls again?
[time=273] Oh today is time accepted.
[time=279] Tomorrow you may call in pain.
[time=286] You and I now live to Jesus.
[time=293] Soon we'll pass God's way of praise.
[time=299] Soon the heart and call in silence.
[time=305] And thy Savior's been seized.
[time=318] O Lord Jesus, sing a glory.
[time=324] Sweet the high store by the open.
[time=337] O come to my heart, O Jesus, there is room in my heart for me.
[time=353] Yes there is room in my heart for me.
[time=368] Let's continue our singing as we sing as a congregation hymn
[time=377] I hope you're listening carefully to the words as this is the beginning of a new year, a time when we recommit our love for the Lord and our commitment to serve Him throughout the year.
[time=392] We're going to sing the first and second stanzas together.
[time=396] Let us stand.
[time=403] Oh Lord Jesus, come, give it to us.
[time=454] Let my hands grow today.
[time=459] Let my people in this place.
[time=465] Let my hands be Jesus only.
[time=471] Let my hands be born this way.
[time=477] Oh my Jesus, come, give it to us.
[time=483] Let my hands be born this way.
[time=489] Oh my Jesus, come, give it to us.
[time=495] Let my hands be born this way.
[time=503] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=510] This morning we have a privilege to meet and to worship together.
[time=514] And as we meet and worship together we take the benefit of many people who use their time and their talent to make our service as possible.
[time=522] Those that sing in the choir, those that labor in the nursery.
[time=525] And this morning we're missing our regular pianist Jeannie Hicks because she's at the hospital hopefully in the next few moments having their fourth child.
[time=533] And we just are so thankful that we have people who faithfully serve right up to the last minute they possibly can.
[time=540] And others have filled in and you've used your talents and gifts to serve the Lord.
[time=545] Now Dennis Kirschner who normally is seen on the organ is going to come and sing a song that tells us of a great spiritual truth.
[time=552] The fact that regardless of what has transpired in our life, the forgiveness of God is sufficient.
[time=558] Because when Jesus died on the cross on Calvary, Calvary covers it all.
[time=563] Dennis, thank you for your ministry today.
[time=565] [MUSIC]
[time=579] For tearer than all, that the world can impart is the message that came to my heart.
[time=594] How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone, and Calvary covers it all.
[time=617] Calvary covers it all.
[time=626] My past with its sin and its shame, my guilt and despair, Jesus took on him there, and Calvary covers it all.
[time=655] Calvary covers it all.
[time=670] My past with its sin and shame, my guilt and despair,
[time=684] Jesus took on him there, and Calvary covers it all.
[time=699] [MUSIC]
[time=714] So blesses the thought that my soul by him bought,
[time=723] shelled well in his glory on the line, where with gladness and song I'll be one of the throngs,
[time=742] and Calvary covers it all.
[time=762] My past with its sin and its shame, my guilt and despair, Jesus took on him there,
[time=781] and Calvary covers it all.
[time=835] My past with its sin and despair, Jesus took on him there, and he said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=864] He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=879] He said, "I'm not going to be a man." He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=900] He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=963] He said, "I'm not going to be a man." He said, "I'm not going to be a man." He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=986] He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=1009] He said, "I'm not going to be a man." He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=1023] He said, "I'm not going to be a man."
[time=3196] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, thank You for the childhood of hate, where I learned to survive in a damaged world.
[time=3221] And Father, today, I thank You for my mother who still lives and knows You're not.
[time=3232] I thank You for allowing her to give me physical life this morning I pray and Lord for eternal life in her heart.
[time=3244] Thank You for teaching me to give my Father, to love my Father here on Earth.
[time=3252] And for the nine years, I'm healing the heart.
[time=3260] Thank You for my wife.
[time=3264] Thank You for her prayers, and thank You Lord Jesus for coming into my heart and teaching me the meaning of my Word, the significant light truth in the reality of life salvation.
[time=3283] Lord Jesus, thank You for helping me to speak of my power and my mercy.
[time=3292] Thank You for putting in me a challenge to love one another, even as You have lumped me.
[time=3303] Now Lord Jesus, I pray for anyone who might hear my testimony that through You and through thy Holy Spirit, that even one heart might be opened this day unto You.
[time=3321] And Lord for those who know You, I pray that You will help us reach out and touch even one life.
[time=3334] I thank You Lord Jesus, and thy loving and blessed name. Amen.
[time=3348] Thank You Don. The message that He has shared this morning is obviously unique in all that His life holds.
[time=3358] The poverty, the handicap, the rejection.
[time=3363] They may not be characteristic of Your life today and in that sense His life is truly unique.
[time=3369] But the one thing that is common to every one of us is Jesus Christ can come into our lives.
[time=3376] He can give us new hope. He can give us forgiveness of sins.
[time=3380] He can transform the bitterness and the resentment.
[time=3384] Today you've got to make a decision just like Don made a decision nine years ago.
[time=3389] And that decision is what we do with Jesus who is called the Christ.
[time=3393] You can accept Him as Your personal Savior, or you can make the decision to reject Him.
[time=3401] Too many times we say, "Well, I'm going to think about it." And I would never discourage you from thinking something through and not making a hasty decision.
[time=3410] But too often we just postpone, "I want to encourage you to act today."
[time=3416] Our Father as we come to one time.
[time=3421] The point of climax in this service, we pray that the testimony that we've heard, that we translate it into a life-changing experience in each heart that doesn't know Christ today,
[time=3433] that Your Spirit would so high us.
[time=3435] I'm glad that you had the opportunity to hear our guest speaker, Don Bartlett, this morning.
[time=3439] Father, if as a result of this program, you've made a decision that they might concern your spiritual life.
[time=3444] I'd like to take a moment right now and pray with you.
[time=3447] Let us pray together.
[time=3449] Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins.
[time=3456] And today our sins and sin for Christ to come into my life, to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse my heart.
[time=3464] Jesus, I ask You to come in today.
[time=3467] Jesus Christ, I pray, amen.
[time=3470] If You do, we want to invite You to respond right now.
[time=3473] Let's stand together and sing.
[time=3475] And when you write, we'll send you a poem written in title of Your Decision.
[time=3478] Others may come today to make the probably the faith in Christ.
[time=3481] We talked about timeless insights.

[time=3549] Now, speaking for Pastor Rick Hawks, this is Jerry Hoffman, inviting you to join us every week at this time.
[time=3558] In just a moment, we will sing the last hymn of this invitation.
[time=3579] But just so you understand, the purpose of a hymn like this is to create a time for each of us as individuals to do an analysis,
[time=3588] an audit, an investigation of our own hearts and our own lives.
[time=3593] What a person's is the right of an adequate income to ensure that the older, the later years are spent and lived in dignity and comfort.
[time=3603] Fortunately, in America, there's Social Security.
[time=3607] But unfortunately, many older people retired on Social Security alone, and it's often not adequate to meet all their needs.
[time=3616] Our guest today is Paul Schmidt, our friend Paul Schmidt, back from Social Security.
[time=3621] Hi, Paul.
[time=3622] Hi.
[time=3623] I keep promising the people we're going to have you twice a year, and here you are back again for your spring visit, and we're glad to see you.
[time=3629] Now, I know that a lot of things have been happening in Social Security, but before we get into that, Paul, let's go right.
[time=3637] [SILENCE - 80 seconds]
