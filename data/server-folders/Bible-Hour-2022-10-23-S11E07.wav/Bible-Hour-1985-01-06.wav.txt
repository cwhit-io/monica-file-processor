[time=33] [MUSIC]
[time=47] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=51] Now live from the convocation center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=68] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=71] - You take your hymnos, please, as we join together to sing how great thou art hymn number 801, let us stand together as we sing.
[time=80] (gentle music)
[time=87] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=143] - And the last verse together.
[time=146] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=207] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=210] - What a joy it is this morning to sing that song has become a theme of our hearts today.
[time=218] How great thou art.
[time=220] We've assembled this morning in this place and are invited into the homes of many by way of television to bring praise to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=229] As we meet this morning, we want to draw everyone's attention to Him.
[time=233] We want to welcome you today, not only to a time of worship, but for a time of folkness sing our eyes upon Jesus.
[time=241] If in this next hour we do nothing more than turn our eyes upon Jesus, than we've done all that we are supposed to do.
[time=248] Kevin Rowan, our choir, are going to sing that great hymn for us today.
[time=252] Let it quiet your hearts and direct your eyes attention to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=257] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=262] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=475] - We turn our eyes on the Lord
[time=491] and we begin to anticipate the perfection that we'll have only when we arrive with him in heaven.
[time=498] That does not allow us however to keep us from striving to grow and to be like our heavenly Father.
[time=503] We're going to sing together 461.
[time=506] We'll sing the first and second stanzas of O to be like the Him number 461.
[time=520] [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=632] As we enter this new year, 1985, we want to include something new in our morning worship service.
[time=639] On Sunday morning anywhere from 12 or 1300 to 1500 people come here and we have opportunity to worship the Lord together.
[time=648] But the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church is far more diverse and involved than simply the morning worship service.
[time=655] We have a number of ministries and many of you may only know that they exist and know little about them and perhaps some of you don't even know that some of the ministries exist.
[time=665] I often am amazed that people say I'm in need of a Christian counselor, can you recommend anybody?
[time=671] And I say, well, we've got a counseling center with two counselors and they're amazed and that may be one of the best kept secrets in Fort Wayne.
[time=679] Well, during this new year, we're going to have a part of our service that we call focus on the ministry.
[time=685] And for a month, we'll focus our attention on a given ministry so that during that time, you and I can become better acquainted with all of the opportunities that are ours.
[time=694] During January, we thought it best to focus on the ministry of Sunday school.
[time=699] We have a Sunday school program for people of all ages from the cradle roll all the way through senior adults and the individual who coordinates the elementary Sunday school is Jeff Vaughn and I've asked Jeff to come today and to just share his enthusiasm for Sunday school.
[time=715] He and his wife, Jennifer, do a tremendous job that is a major task with enthusiasm.
[time=722] Well, we thank you, Jeff.
[time=723] And all the work that they do is indicative of how their heart beats for Sunday school.
[time=729] Jeff, would you just begin by sharing your enthusiasm about the ministry?
[time=733] - Well, I was privileged three years ago to get involved with Sunday school.
[time=738] And since then, what I have been allowed to be a part of is really joyous.
[time=745] I've been, every week, it seems like a parent will take me to the side and share with me an experience that they had with their child and it goes something like this.
[time=756] You know, my child came to me, this could be a six-year-old, it could be a two-year-old, a three-year-old, it could even be a 13-year-old and said, dad, mom, and with that gave a deep spiritual truth.
[time=771] One that kind of stunned or awed the parent.
[time=775] One that they hadn't expected to hear from their child.
[time=778] And they were really blessed by that.
[time=781] It's been a not an unusual experience to have a parent pull off to the side of the road because their child was really talking to them about things of Christ and things of God.
[time=792] And with that, the parent will tell me invariably this will happen.
[time=797] Do you know Jeff, my child prayed the prayer of commitment and turned his or her life over to Jesus Christ?
[time=804] And they'll say, Jeff, it's because your teachers have told them in their Sunday school class about Christ.
[time=811] It's because they have been nurtured in the ways of God and they'll sometimes they'll get very careful.
[time=819] They get very sensitive to what's going on.
[time=823] And they just, with that, they thank me and they want me to thank the teachers.
[time=828] And to be allowed to see that and to be a part of that week after week for me has just been a joy every week.
[time=838] Well, you know, Jeff, we have people come to Christ literally through just about every ministry we have.
[time=844] And when we have a baptismal service once a month, we ask people how they came to Christ.
[time=849] And we hear people that came to Christ through the television ministry, through worship service, through evangelism, visitation, through home Bible studies.
[time=856] But always the majority, if there is a majority, at least the most common is I accepted Christ in Sunday school.
[time=864] And that is really tremendous.
[time=866] Jeff, one of the things that's very easy for someone like myself and perhaps you who are parents to think is that Sunday school is where we drop off our kids so they're taken care of so we can come here.
[time=877] And it's just a glorified babysitting service.
[time=880] I've found that that is absolutely not true.
[time=883] You're so right.
[time=884] Tell them just a little bit about how early the children begin to learn.
[time=887] You know, in nursery four and in toddler one, which is 18 months to 30 months, they have curriculums.
[time=894] They have structure and they're learning how to behave and belong in a classroom situation.
[time=901] And even at that early age, those children are hearing about Christ.
[time=905] They're being taught about what God has done for them.
[time=908] And that is an ongoing process.
[time=911] There is never really a moment where we are just minding the child.
[time=916] We are training and teaching them about God and what God has for them in their lives.
[time=922] Even at 18 months and they learn, they pick it up.
[time=925] They know who God is.
[time=928] This is not over their heads.
[time=930] You know, Jeff, we found that to be true in our home.
[time=932] Adam is about 20 months old and he's learned to pray.
[time=936] And when we sit down at the table, he closes his eyes how child they just push those lids shut and he folds his hand and continues to eat.
[time=944] But you know, that's not too bad.
[time=946] You've got his eyes closed and his hands folded.
[time=948] With his little hands folded, he just nibbles away.
[time=950] But he's learning.
[time=952] You know, what a joy it is as a parent to have your children learn principles and habits that are honoring to the Lord.
[time=959] That's really great.
[time=960] And you've got a great group of teachers that are working.
[time=962] - Our teachers take hours per week to prepare their lesson.
[time=966] And then of course they take their hour during Sunday and they sacrifice that time.
[time=971] But they get so much in return from your children and they give a lot, but they do get a lot back.
[time=977] And after having talked with them, they're really excited about what they're able to do for your child.
[time=983] - Well, Jeff, I personally appreciate not only the teachers ministry of course, but yours and Jennifer's.
[time=989] And as there are anything else, I don't want to cut you off that you might want to share.
[time=993] - It's just that we are committed to sharing Christ with your child and to growing them up in the Word of God.
[time=1000] - Jeff, thank you so much for your ministry and your enthusiasm.
[time=1004] God bless you.
[time=1005] Well, what a joy it is to have people like Jeff and Jennifer and all of our Sunday school teachers who just make their life's work to serve the Lord in this place.
[time=1014] If you're not familiar with our structure, we have two worship services.
[time=1017] This is the second one.
[time=1019] And simultaneous, there is an adult child Sunday school program.
[time=1024] So if you come to the first hour, you could be in Sunday school right now, or if you come this hour, you could have gone to Sunday school.
[time=1029] And we want to encourage you this January to take advantage of all the ministries that are available Sunday school in particular.
[time=1038] Well, part of our worship is always music.
[time=1040] The Bible tells us to sing hymns to one another, spiritual songs, praising God.
[time=1045] The nice Mitchell is going to come and minister to us in song.
[time=1048] Thank you, Denise.
[time=1049] (gentle music)
[time=1062] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=1152] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=1241] - Sit down.
[time=1242] Again, we want to welcome you to the Bible hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1249] Pete, how are the Kobe family?
[time=1251] - We're recuperating very well after the Christmas season, coming back to normal, I think.
[time=1255] - Well, I like the Christmas season, but I sure enjoy what we call normal, too.
[time=1259] - Right.
[time=1260] - One of the primary focuses of this ministry, of course, is the Bible, God's Word.
[time=1265] And we want to give you our every encouragement to be studying God's Word.
[time=1270] We count it as a privilege to come into your home or perhaps your hospital room today and to share God's love and His Word with you.
[time=1278] But this broadcast are two or three more like it, aren't enough to feed you all that you need spiritually.
[time=1284] It's important that you be self-taught and self-fed God's Word.
[time=1288] The Bible encourages us to study it daily.
[time=1291] And one of the best ways that I know to do that is with this helpful booklet called "Timeless Insights." It'll take you through the New Testament in an entire year.
[time=1300] This being January, I think it's important that you make a commitment in this new year to be studying God's Word.
[time=1308] Timeless Insights will help you do that as it gives you a systematic plan so that you're not opening up the Bible here one day, there the next day, hunting for something meaningful the third day, this will give structure and direction.
[time=1320] And then it will also give you some additional help as you listen to what some of the most godly men in history have said about this passage as you read their timeless insight.
[time=1330] Of course, there's another application that you can make and some scriptures listed for additional insight and reading.
[time=1337] If you'd like a copy of this, we want to send it to you free so that you can begin studying God's Word in the new year, 1985.
[time=1345] Pete, would you share with our friends how they can get their copy?
[time=1348] - So we want to encourage our viewers to write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1358] That's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1365] - Thank you, Pete.
[time=1366] Music is also a very big part of our ministry and we have with us today some of our own people, some personal friends who've ministered so well in song and they're going to be singing in just a moment or two but we also bring in some special guests that have a great ministry to us and we've got two guests or two groups actually coming up.
[time=1386] - We like the variety that's available to us not only with our own people, Rick, but also with guests that we have.
[time=1392] We'd like to encourage our viewers to be aware of the concert that's coming up next Sunday evening, January 13th.
[time=1399] We're going to have the Women's Glee Club and Handbell Choir from Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1404] That concert, Rick, will start at 5.45 p.m. next Sunday, January 13th.
[time=1410] That's 15 minutes earlier than our regular program but we want to encourage everyone to come.
[time=1415] And then next Sunday, all day, we will have guests with us, the Sun Light Trio.
[time=1420] They've been here many times and our people just love them and I've gotten a couple notes from them.
[time=1426] They've said they're anxious to come back to Black Hawk so the Sun Light Trio will be with us January 20th in our morning worship services and then for a full concert at 6 p.m. January 20th.
[time=1438] - Well, Pete, you're right.
[time=1439] Those young men are amongst, the absolute favorites here at our church and I'm looking forward to the Women's Glee Club and then Sun Light Quartet, the week after that and the ministry that they'll have.
[time=1449] We are so thankful and I want to say this to you publicly for the ministry of music.
[time=1454] It is such a balanced approach to good Christian music that encourages us and ministers to us, helps us to be prepared to worship and for my life provides one of the best excitements I know.
[time=1465] That is just great and I appreciate all that you do.
[time=1467] - Thank you, Rick.
[time=1468] It's a privilege to help prepare the people for the messages that we hear.
[time=1472] Certainly music can't do it by itself but it can be an in-road to preparing the hearts of people for the word of God.
[time=1478] - Well, you do a great job and we appreciate that.
[time=1481] We appreciate each of you too.
[time=1483] Your prayers, your support, your encouragement, your word of admonition as we meet in a hospital or at the mall or somewhere here at the living Christmas tree, we appreciate each of you.
[time=1494] And many of you are financial supporters of this ministry and we do appreciate that as well.
[time=1499] As we came to the end of last year, we sent out a letter to alert you to some of the opportunities that are ours and asked you to respond by mail.
[time=1508] So if you received our letter, let me encourage you today.
[time=1511] If you haven't read that, take the time after the busy holidays, open up your mail and see what's been said there and respond in the way that you believe God would want you to.
[time=1520] Again, we wanna thank you for joining us today and as we go back to the live part of our worship service, we trust that you'll stay with us and that God will use this to strengthen your faith in the Lord.
[time=1531] [MUSIC - 378 seconds]
[time=1913] [MUSIC] To a group of people who viewed the Pharisees and scribes as the pinnacle of religious devotion [MUSIC] Those were tough words to hear [MUSIC] And they were meant to be that [MUSIC] That unless we exceed them [MUSIC] We're unacceptable to God [MUSIC] Those were frightening and intimidating words because if anyone based upon religious duty and observation was going to heaven [MUSIC] It was the group that Jesus just excluded as having inadequate righteousness [MUSIC] That statement is pivotal in the Sermon on the Mount [MUSIC] Following that verse, Jesus goes on to explain what he meant [MUSIC] He uses the expression you have heard it said by them of old [MUSIC] That's actually another way of saying it's been a rule for a long time and you all know it [MUSIC] Actually he's going right back to the Ten Commandments [MUSIC] Last week we looked at the statement you've heard it said of old that thou shall not kill [MUSIC] The basic standard [MUSIC] And then Jesus said, "But I say unto you, you're guilty of that same crime [MUSIC] If you verbally assault someone, our harbor anger against them." That's a tough standard.
[time=1998] That was exactly Jesus' intention.
[time=2001] Because as we discussed last week, it is totally possible for you to be right and at the same time to be wrong.
[time=2009] We may be doing the right thing in terms of activity, but in our hearts, our attitudes are wrong.
[time=2018] And Jesus probes deeper than mere actions into thoughts and attitudes and appetites.
[time=2025] He uses that same expression for our study today in verse 27.
[time=2029] You have heard it said, Matthew 5, 27, "By them of old, thou shall not commit adultery."
[time=2042] But I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[time=2056] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee.
[time=2064] For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body should be cast into hell.
[time=2074] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee.
[time=2082] For it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
[time=2091] I want to admit to you today that there are an easier passage of scripture to talk about.
[time=2097] I know that many of us struggle with what did Jesus meant about this eye plucking and hand severing business.
[time=2105] It's obvious by looking across this congregation, including its pastor, that we either do not take this literally,
[time=2111] or we are amongst the most righteous people who have ever lived, because it seems that most of our hands are on our arms and our eyes are intact.
[time=2120] What did Jesus mean by that?
[time=2123] Well, this morning we want to talk about that a little bit, but before we do, we need to look again at Jesus' elevation of God's standards.
[time=2132] You know, both in our society and in the ancient society that Jesus walked in, there was a constant demand to lower the standard.
[time=2142] If someone is not passing, well, don't fail them, lower the standard.
[time=2150] And society in Jesus' time had basically taken a very liberal interpretation of the law that shall not commit adultery.
[time=2160] They very narrowly defined it so as to make life a little easier and allow more people to pass that standard.
[time=2169] And Jesus, just like He did in the issue of murder with adultery, goes far deeper than mere actions and looks at our attitudes.
[time=2179] You see, this crowd that He first addressed to were probably a very, very moral group.
[time=2185] If any of them had ever committed adultery, it was certainly a well-kept secret because they dealt with it swiftly.
[time=2192] This was probably one of the most moral select groups in history.
[time=2196] And they fully expect Jesus to say, "Thou've heard it said by them the world, thou should not commit adultery."
[time=2202] And you guys have done great.
[time=2204] God is so proud of you.
[time=2206] You're just marvelous in your obedience to this particular commandment.
[time=2210] And you just need to hear it from God.
[time=2213] Well done.
[time=2214] That's what they expected.
[time=2216] They expected some type of commendation, not condemnation.
[time=2221] They expected approval and assurances of future prosperity in heaven.
[time=2229] And much to their surprise, Jesus goes at Him again.
[time=2235] Skipping over the obvious legal interpretation of what adultery is and is not.
[time=2243] And says, "Whosoever looks upon a woman to lust after her is guilty of adultery because he's already committed it in his heart."
[time=2256] Now Jesus lived in a rather male-oriented society and I think it's important for us to make sure that no one feels left out today.
[time=2264] I am confident that we are appropriate in translating this passage.
[time=2269] I'm not a translating, excuse me, applying this passage to each gender.
[time=2275] In our society, the rivalry of male lust is being greatly challenged by female lust.
[time=2284] And whosoever looks upon a man with lust in her heart is guilty of adultery.
[time=2291] You see what Jesus was doing? He was doing the opposite of what my instincts and yours happen to be.
[time=2298] Our instincts say lower the standard, lower the standard, and Jesus constantly raises the standard.
[time=2305] One of the most popular thoughts that has swept across the Western world in religious circles, in Christian circles, comes under the name of situational ethics.
[time=2316] Popularized by Joseph Fletcher, who wrote the book of the same name, Situational Ethics, it has two basic axioms that it teaches.
[time=2325] First axiom is this. There is no absolute right or wrong. Right and wrong is determined by the context of that situation.
[time=2335] There is not a list of absolute yeses, absolute noes, absolute do's, absolute don'ts.
[time=2342] The do's and the don'ts are up to you to determine based upon who you are, how you've been raised, who you're dealing with in the whole situation.
[time=2352] Second axiom is this. For the Christian, says the Situational Ethics, the axiom by which he determines how to behave in a situation, the only norm, the only absolute, is to act in love.
[time=2367] Now there's a point of appeal there. And the theology they have built is elaborate. Did not Jesus say, one asked, what is the greatest of all the commandments?
[time=2379] That we are to love the Lord our God with all of our hearts, with all of our soul, with all of our might.
[time=2384] And the second is like unto that, the love thy neighbor as thyself. Did not Jesus say upon these two hang all the law in the prophets?
[time=2391] So if we just act in love, we're fulfilling all the law and we need not deal with all these absolutes, the only absolute is to love.
[time=2398] Well that sounds good. So you take a deeper look.
[time=2403] First of all, the same God who said, thou shall love me first and love thy neighbor secondly said, you need some definition.
[time=2412] And let me give you how you act lovingly and hence he gives us this word that is absolute.
[time=2419] Secondly, there is the great problem that though I may say I'm acting in love, how am I as a human able to determine each situation?
[time=2430] There's so much room for my prejudice, my air, in saying what the situation determines.
[time=2436] And then in whose love do I act, my love, the love of the person I'm dealing with, the love of the people that aren't involved?
[time=2445] It doesn't work. You can't lower the standard and say if we just love everybody, then it's all right and if it just is born out of love, it's all right.
[time=2456] You can read books and I'm embarrassed to say it, but of Christian roots that say if two couples become involved sexually and they're basically, I don't know the proper phraseology, if they're wife swapping or husband swapping,
[time=2474] and they really love the other person more, then God wants them to be fulfilled and he wants their love to be expressed and if that's how they can best express their love, then that's God's plan.
[time=2487] Premarital relationships are justified that it's all right for us to be sexually involved because we love each other as though that's God's only standard.
[time=2497] It's not God's standard, because standard was absolute purity.
[time=2502] I have a book on my shelf written about homosexuality and again from an institution that has been historically Christian.
[time=2512] And the writers make this point, that God is a God of love and as long as we are reflecting love, we are reflecting God.
[time=2522] So if this man loves this man, then it's all right.
[time=2529] And they quickly ignore the passages that very clearly denounce homosexuality in the Bible as being just a situation of that day and say that the Bible says that David loved Jonathan and of course we now interpret that to mean homosexuality because we're looking for such a justification.
[time=2551] Our society wants to lower the standards and lower the standards and Jesus elevate it and say homosexuality is not only wrong, adultery is not only wrong, premarital sex is not only wrong, lust is wrong.
[time=2568] The phraseology of this statement says a man or we'll give equal time here, a woman who looks upon someone and there's a purpose clause there, it says with the purpose of lusting after her.
[time=2583] I think that admits the fact that we may see someone unintentionally, they're attractive, but we're not to do what the commercials encourage us to do.
[time=2594] Our society encourages us to lust. It tells you what drink to drink if you want to be the one that the girl watchers watch.
[time=2604] That's what it's talking about. It's talking about that intention of heart that says I want to look.
[time=2610] I want to use my eyes to feed my mind that my appetite might be fester. Jesus said thoughts of sin are as culpable as deeds of sin.
[time=2626] Thoughts hold us just as guilty as deeds. And he went on to give illustration as to how they were to deal with that with this difficult statement that says, pluck out your eye, cut off your hand.
[time=2642] Your hand is causing you to take that which doesn't belong, you cut it off. Your eye is covetous, you saw this wonderful car that your neighbor had and you wanted it and you were mad that he got it before you did, pluck out your eye.
[time=2657] You're a college student and they put those desks so close together, an honest person can't help but notice the answer on the page next to him.
[time=2666] If you're going to be honest, let's just gouge out your eye and then you won't have to worry about seeing that examination paper.
[time=2672] That's what Jesus was saying. Let's be honest, this body of people, we subscribe to what we call a literal interpretation of the Scriptures.
[time=2682] That means we believe what the Bible says to be literally true. When it says Jesus arose from the grave, that didn't mean his spirit went to heaven.
[time=2689] That meant his dead body came back to life and that same Jesus walked around.
[time=2694] When the Bible says God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day, we mean that he took one 24 hour day and created this and the next day he created this and in six days he was all done.
[time=2707] He started with nothing and it all came from that. We don't mean by six days that each day is an age of approximately 10 billion years and hence allow for evolution.
[time=2719] We take it literally. Then should we not take literally the statement, pluck out your eye, cut off your hand.
[time=2726] Let's just talk for a moment. When we say we take the Scriptures literally, we allow the Scriptures to be God's literal word but also recognize that they are literature that uses normal literal devices. What do I mean by that?
[time=2741] Well, the Bible uses parables. That's an analogy. The Bible uses metaphors and similes and figures of speech.
[time=2750] There is enough the Bible, the common use of dramatic figures of speech.
[time=2759] By a dramatic figure of speech, we mean a hyperbola where a speaker exaggerates his point to get your attention.
[time=2767] Let me just illustrate that. Suppose this morning instead of bringing my Bible, I brought my chopping block and butcher knife from home and said,
[time=2777] "Some of you around here been stealing and whacked my chopping block with the butcher knife and said, "We're going to start cutting off hands."
[time=2786] I want to suggest to you that would have been something that broke the routine of our Sunday morning habits. It's rather dramatic, isn't it? It gets attention.
[time=2796] Here are a bunch of people kind of standing around waiting for the usual statements to be made and Jesus said, "Pluck out that eye!"
[time=2803] And everybody hoped he was pointing to the guy next to him. That's called a dramatic figure of speech. The Bible is full of them. Let me just give you a couple of illustrations.
[time=2814] The last verse of John's Gospel, John has recorded 21 chapters and many miracles of Christ, and at the end of it, he said,
[time=2821] "Jesus did so many miracles that I supposed that if they were written down, the world couldn't hold the books."
[time=2828] Do you think John really thought, "Man, there are so many miracles that if I wrote these down, there just wouldn't be any place on planet earth to put these books?"
[time=2836] That's not what he meant, obviously. He meant that there are so many miracles that it's just amazing that there would be book upon book upon book.
[time=2843] He was exaggerating to say, "There's a whole lot more that I could have told you."
[time=2849] The Bible says that all of Jerusalem came out to see Jesus. That means somebody went to the city and counted, and nobody was home.
[time=2858] Every single person was present and accounted for because the Bible said all, and we take all literally.
[time=2864] No, that's obviously an expression of hyperbola to say there was a great crowd, and Jerusalem was caught up in the event.
[time=2873] That's a hyperbola, a dramatic, exaggerated figure of speech. Let me give you another one.
[time=2879] Many of Jesus' disciples were following him at a rather casual pace and trying to use their family needs as an excuse to be less than committed.
[time=2889] So Jesus said it to them, "Anyone who doesn't hate their father, doesn't hate their mother, doesn't hate their wife, doesn't hate their children, is not worthy to be my disciple."
[time=2903] Was that what Jesus literally meant? We're sitting next to you today, but I just want you to know in the name of God I hate you.
[time=2910] Some may have a head start on that commandment today.
[time=2914] That's obviously not what Jesus meant because the Scripture says that we're to honor and love our parents.
[time=2919] It says, "Husbands, love your wives." What did Jesus mean?
[time=2922] He meant in a dramatic way that our commitment to him must supersede every other commitment in life.
[time=2930] And he just did it in a dramatic way to get their attention.
[time=2934] That's what Jesus has done here. He's used a dramatic figure of speech to get their attention.
[time=2940] But let's not take the emphasis out, even though we're saying he meant self-denial, not self-mutilation.
[time=2947] Let's not miss the point that he was so dramatically trying to get across. I think they're too.
[time=2953] I think the first thing that Jesus was saying that we need to focus our attention on is this.
[time=2959] We're to take radical steps to pull sin out of its roots.
[time=2971] You say your job environment leads you to constantly be held in bondage to sin.
[time=2976] I think he was saying then get a different job, if he meant it's lower pay.
[time=2982] The person that you associate with always mislead you and becomes a place of stumbling, separate yourself from that friend.
[time=2992] He is saying take radical steps, do whatever it takes to pull sin out of our lives at its roots.
[time=3001] Secondly, he was saying it's better to deny ourselves and come to Christ than it is to indulge ourselves and to not have Christ
[time=3011] and enter a Christless eternity in hell.
[time=3015] You've heard it haven't you? Someone says well I'm not going to give my life to Christ because I do this and this and this and I'm not ready to quit.
[time=3024] That's exactly what Jesus was saying.
[time=3026] You better be willing to give up anything that keeps you from coming to me because it's better to deny yourself and have Christ
[time=3036] than to indulge ourselves and not have Christ.
[time=3042] Jesus was very committed to the fact that the bondage of sin needs to be broken in our life.
[time=3048] We want to talk about that this morning but before we do let me just make two observations about sin itself.
[time=3056] First of all sin is basically attractive.
[time=3060] If we as Christians are going to try to convince ourselves or anyone else that we shouldn't sin because it's not fun, we're fools.
[time=3069] Sin is attractive, it's appetizing, it's tantalizing and it basically initiates itself in a good way and the Bible admits that.
[time=3080] Please don't misunderstand me I'm not promoting any type of indulgence.
[time=3084] I'm just admitting right up front that sin is attractive.
[time=3087] Remember Moses' testimony Hebrews 11-25 that he chose rather to suffer with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin.
[time=3098] Sin does have pleasure.
[time=3100] I often liken it to a sugar-coated pill, sweet on the outside but bitter on the inside.
[time=3110] You see sin's attractive, it appears sweet, it appears that it'll taste good and its first taste is good but its bitterness always follows.
[time=3118] The Bible says Moses knew that he could choose the pleasures of sin but for a season.
[time=3126] Secondly sin is not only attractive, it is addictive.
[time=3131] Jesus said whosoever commits sin is a servant to sin.
[time=3136] Every one of us has our own sins and we have our own addictions.
[time=3140] So please don't write this down to pass it to your spouse after church.
[time=3145] It's for me, it's for you.
[time=3149] Every one of us is guilty.
[time=3152] Mine just happens to be different than yours and yours different than the person next to you.
[time=3158] How do you break the bond to just sin?
[time=3161] How does someone who is held captive to lustful thoughts break that?
[time=3165] How does someone who has developed an addiction to alcohol, to nicotine break that?
[time=3172] How does someone who eats too much stop that?
[time=3178] How do you break the lock, the grip that sin often has on us?
[time=3183] I mean if Jesus said pull it out its roots how do you do that?
[time=3195] First of all it's absolutely essential you must have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3202] John chapter 8 verse 32 said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[time=3208] Verse 36 and if the son of God shall set you free you shall be free indeed.
[time=3214] You need to give your heart to Jesus Christ today.
[time=3217] Every one of us needs to do that.
[time=3219] There are people who have been instantaneously been delivered of various things by coming to Christ.
[time=3225] That may happen, that may not happen.
[time=3228] Coming to Christ is the initial step when you receive a new birth and a new nature and a new will and a new spirit that will help you as a new resource in dealing with sin in your life.
[time=3237] It's not necessarily a once and for all aspirin that takes it away but it is God's forgiveness and it is basis for growth.
[time=3244] Have you received Christ as your Savior?
[time=3247] Secondly you must have true repentance and desire to change.
[time=3254] You know most of the people who want to deal with their problem recognize that they are guilty,
[time=3262] that they are in bondage and they are embarrassed and they want to get rid of all three of those.
[time=3267] Now notice I said they want to get rid of those, they want to get rid of the guilt, the bondage and the embarrassment.
[time=3273] They are not certain they really want to get rid of their sin.
[time=3277] There is an area of psychology called behavior modification.
[time=3280] How do you change the behavior of someone who is deviant?
[time=3284] Well behaviorists have quickly learned that even the most deviant of behavior provide some positive consequence
[time=3292] for that person.
[time=3294] The person who is a homosexual may not want to be a homosexual.
[time=3298] The person who is in an immoral relationship may not want to be in that relationship.
[time=3302] The person who is locked into alcohol may not want that.
[time=3305] The person who is locked into lustful thoughts may not want that but there is something about it they do want that keeps them going back and back and back.
[time=3313] What you have to do is be willing to give up what you are getting.
[time=3316] Not just say I don't want the guilt, I don't want anybody to know, I don't want the embarrassment but you have to be willing to change.
[time=3323] Like the old Joe, how many counselors does it take to change a light bulb?
[time=3327] Just one but the bulb has to want to change.
[time=3330] We have to want to change.
[time=3334] Step three, it's essential that we flee from sin at its first appearance.
[time=3341] At its first appearance, that's why Joseph was successful and David was not.
[time=3347] As soon as temptation faced Joseph he fled, as soon as temptation faced David he followed.
[time=3355] If you can't resist temptation at its first occurrence, don't deceive yourself that when it becomes stronger
[time=3361] you will then be able to resist it.
[time=3365] Flee youthful lusts Paul said to Timothy.
[time=3368] Fourthly, follow the principle of positive replacement.
[time=3373] It's not enough just to tell myself I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to do it.
[time=3377] It's like the athlete who said I'm not going to drop this past, drop this past, drop this past.
[time=3382] You just can't say no, you've got to start saying yes to something else.
[time=3386] Romans 14 verse 13, I said that backwards, Romans 13 14, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3395] Every time that inclination is to do the wrong thing you've got to motivate your feet to do the right thing.
[time=3401] You've got to replace it with something positive.
[time=3405] Finally, you've got to make sure you don't set yourself up to fall down.
[time=3410] It says put on the Lord Jesus Christ and give no opportunity to the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof.
[time=3418] Too many times we walk right in the face of temptation and say, how did I give tempted?
[time=3425] Don't do it.
