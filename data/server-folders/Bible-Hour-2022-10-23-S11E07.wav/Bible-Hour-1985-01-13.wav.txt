[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=50] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=54] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=61] With inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=71] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=75] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=123] Let us join together please as we continue to worship the Lord, singing together Him number 801.
[time=128] How great thou art, let us stand please as we sing the first last stands us together.
[time=134] [MUSIC - 119 seconds]
[time=259] What a joy it is for us today to welcome you to our morning worship service, to come to this place, to sing praises to God together, to worship Him, and to come into the homes and the hospital rooms of our community in South Bend by way of the Bible Hour and the ministry of television.
[time=276] We trust that at this very moment there is a spirit of enthusiasm and expectation in your heart that as we've come today we've come not only to observe but we've come to participate with our hearts wide open saying God today, I've come to worship you, I've come to study your word, I've come to sing your praises.
[time=294] We trust that today you sense the love of God as the deepest, most abiding reality of your life
[time=301] that He loves you.
[time=302] Love was when God became a man, when the Lord Jesus Christ took upon Himself
[time=308] our every sin, our every fault, our every shortcoming.
[time=311] That's a great message of salvation that God loved us.
[time=315] When was love?
[time=317] Love was when God became a man.
[time=319] Listen to our choirs, they sing that beautiful song and that beautiful truth.
[time=323] Love was when.
[time=325] Love was when God became a man.
[time=341] And in time and space with a break of grace,
[time=354] love was done by the Jewish being.
[time=363] Just a fire within, with some peace you made.
[time=375] Love was when Jesus bought me misery.
[time=385] Love immediately brought a new life as free.
[time=396] Love was gone, made to redefine, to reach and help one searchers on.
[time=414] Love became a man.
[time=422] Love was when God became a man.
[time=430] Love was when I could see you, love and reach you.
[time=441] Love was done by the poor my sin.
[time=450] Then some tread was done by the whole world became a man.
[time=461] Love was when Jesus met me now it's free.
[time=528] Praise the Lord that we had a personal savior that came down to save my sins if we'd but accept that gift of eternal life personally.
[time=542] Appreciate the ministry of music and from time to time we have various people assisting us, the organ and piano and soloists.
[time=550] Just a few months ago now when I considered taking this position again for the second time
[time=556] I asked who was on the instruments and they told me that Dennis Kirschner was still playing the piano that is the organ.
[time=563] And Jeannie Hicks was on the piano and I inquired about another fellow that had played the piano often at Blackhawk and his name was Paul Turner.
[time=571] They told me that Paul had gone to Florida.
[time=574] I had almost made up my mind and since I knew that Paul had gone to Florida I said that does it I'll come back to Blackhawk.
[time=583] Now that's certainly a joke if you know the relationship between Paul and me because I really love him and I'm just delighted that Paul and Jeannie Turner have come back and moved back to Fort Wayne.
[time=592] This morning Paul is back on the piano, Jeannie Hicks is ill, Scott is in Ohio and we're just delighted that he has the talent and the willingness to serve the Lord in this capacity.
[time=603] So Paul and Jeannie we welcome you back to Blackhawk.
[time=606] Let's continue our worship together as we sing a great song of peace and tranquility. It is well with my soul.
[time=613] Him #417 will sing the first and third stanzas together #417.
[time=643] [MUSIC - 89 seconds]
[time=737] - As we shared last week, we are beginning a new dimension
[time=755] to the Morning Worship Service called Focus on the Ministry.
[time=759] And each month we want to share with you a little insight into some of the other ministries of our church.
[time=765] This month, we're focusing on the Ministry of Sunday School.
[time=768] Last week, Jeff Vaughn shared with us some of the exciting things that were happening in the Ministry of Children's Sunday School.
[time=775] But today, we want to focus not just on children's Sunday School, but particularly on adult Sunday School.
[time=781] I've asked Dave and Marilyn Knuth who are part of our church to come and to share with you what their involvement in Sunday School has been, and how that has been a blessing to their life.
[time=790] This is Marilyn and David Knuth.
[time=792] Welcome today, and thank you for being willing to share a word of testimony.
[time=796] David, what class are you involved?
[time=798] What's the name, and tell us a little bit about the class?
[time=801] - We're involved in the Young Mary's class, and the new name we have for the class is the New Covenant, and the meaning of that for our class is that the New Covenant we have in Jesus Christ, and also the New Covenant we have with our new spouses in the Young Mary's class.
[time=814] - Well, that's a good name to take.
[time=816] I didn't know the history of that name until you told us this morning.
[time=819] And to have a class where young couples are together to stimulate each other, to grow together, not only as a couple, but with the Lord, that's exciting.
[time=827] Marilyn, tell us a little bit about the format of your class, what happens each week?
[time=832] - Every week, we spend about 15 to 20 minutes listening to praise notes and prayer requests for each other in our Sunday School class.
[time=838] That gives us an opportunity to learn to know each other better and to make the big church a small church.
[time=844] It gives us an opportunity to go to love each other more.
[time=847] - Well, that's exciting because I've heard about some of those times of praise and the things you've been praying for, and in recent months you had been praying for a young couple in your class.
[time=857] David, tell us about that.
[time=859] - We had a young couple that had joined our class probably about a year ago, and they were unsaved through the ministry of the speaking here, and also in the Sunday School class they came to know the Lord in the fall.
[time=873] - Well, that's really exciting because I remember that class praying for this couple, and representative of your class in a men's prayer meeting, praying for them, and lo and behold, God answered that prayer.
[time=884] That's a great time of fellowship that you have in your class.
[time=887] It's also a time of Bible study, isn't it?
[time=889] Marilyn, tell us about that.
[time=891] - We have an excellent teacher in our Sunday School class.
[time=894] He not only teaches the word and gives us basic Bible teaching, but he also gives us a way to apply it to our lives and everyday living.
[time=902] - Well, that's great.
[time=903] One final question I'll put you on the spot.
[time=905] Do you have any words of encouragement to those who may not be attending Sunday School, but just sneaking into the large auditorium here?
[time=913] - Well, we feel that going to Sunday School is one of the most important hours that you'll spend during your week.
[time=919] Gives you an opportunity for individualized Bible study, but also gives you an opportunity to get to know the small group and the small people within the church.
[time=928] - Well, thank you so much for the courage to share.
[time=931] You did a fine job and we appreciate your involvement in our church.
[time=934] God bless you.
[time=936] You know, there is a temptation.
[time=937] When you come to a church where an auditorium is full and there are two services, you can sneak in and sneak out and go unnoticed.
[time=946] And one young man came and told me that's why he comes here, because he wants to be able to sneak in and sneak out.
[time=952] You know, that's not God's plan for our life.
[time=954] The Bible says we're not the forsake, the assembling of ourselves together, but that we are to meet and to stimulate each other.
[time=962] How can you be stimulated by each other if you don't know each other?
[time=965] Well, this is a large church and we intend to keep it small by keeping our Sunday School classes small so that there are bases of fellowship and growth together.
[time=974] If you're not a part of a Sunday School class, you can't begin today because you're already hearing this is the second hour, but next Sunday, we'll look forward to seeing you in Sunday School.
[time=984] Music, what a joy it is to listen to music that brings to our attention the majestic name of our God.
[time=992] Marsha Ives has been here as a guest many times visiting her sister, Barb Padilla, but she's moved to Fort Wayne.
[time=998] She's working with the fine radio station, WFCV.
[time=1001] She's now a part of our church.
[time=1003] Marsha, we're glad to claim you as us.
[time=1005] Thank you for your ministry today.
[time=1010] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 123 seconds]
[time=1139] - Again, we want to welcome you to the Bible Hour this evening.
[time=1152] Today, we want to talk directly with you friends who are joining us in South Bend.
[time=1156] It is really a privilege for us to have the opportunity to bring the ministry of the Bible Hour into your community.
[time=1163] Pete, that's hometown for you.
[time=1165] - Yes, the water of elite Michigan is about 40 miles north of South Bend, and that's where I grew up.
[time=1171] My father had a church there in that little town for 13 years.
[time=1175] We have a great number of friends and even relatives that currently live in the South Bend area, and I'm delighted that we're back there in that area so they can see the program and worship with us this way.
[time=1186] - What was the name of the father, Pastor there?
[time=1189] - That was the Midway Baptist Church in water of elite Michigan and water of elite.
[time=1194] - Pastor Harold Knickerbocker is the pastor now.
[time=1196] He's been there for several years.
[time=1198] He's a fine man.
[time=1198] That's a very good church if you're in that area.
[time=1202] - Well, you know, it is always a joy for us to know that the ministry is expanding and reaching more people's lives.
[time=1208] And we were in South Bend a number of years ago.
[time=1210] We're not able to broadcast there for the last two and a half years.
[time=1214] So this is somewhat of a homecoming for us this month of January to be able to come back into the South Bend area and all the places that Channel 46 reaches.
[time=1223] And we are so delighted that you're watching today.
[time=1226] We'd like to ask you to do us a very special favor.
[time=1230] Very often here in Fort Wayne, someone will come up to Peter to myself and say, we saw you on TV.
[time=1236] Now, we're not in your community, so people don't have the chance to personally tell us that.
[time=1241] So we want to ask you to write to us.
[time=1244] Your writing just lets us know that someone is there on the other side of the camera and they are watching the ministry.
[time=1250] So if you could take the time and spend the 20 cents on a stamp, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you.
[time=1257] Pete, would you give them the address?
[time=1259] - We encourage our listeners to write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1268] Write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1275] We would love to hear from you just to know that you're there and some of your impressions of the ministry, perhaps suggestions that you have for us, maybe even some words of encouragement.
[time=1285] Also, to come back to South Bend has been a step of growth and a step of faith for us.
[time=1290] And if God puts it in your heart to support this ministry, we'd greatly appreciate that.
[time=1295] At the end of today's broadcast, our narrator will tell you how you can become a member of the Founders Club.
[time=1301] Or if you're not going to choose to be a member of the Founders Club, your support and any kind would greatly be appreciated.
[time=1307] Pete, one more time, the address.
[time=1309] Write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1317] One of the things we like to do is not only to send to you the broadcast of the Bible hour by way of television, but to encourage you with some helpful Christian literature.
[time=1327] It was 1973.
[time=1330] 12 years ago that the United States Supreme Court in a monumental decision, Roe versus Wade, legalized abortion in this country.
[time=1340] Since that time, it's been almost impossible to estimate the number of children whose lives were destroyed by abortion.
[time=1347] The numbers soar, soar into the millions of children.
[time=1352] We believe the Bible teaches very clearly that abortion is not an alternative for the believer, that it is actually the taking of a life.
[time=1360] That's very clearly taught in passages like Psalm 139, where God tells by David's voice that he is fearfully and wonderfully made us.
[time=1369] David said, in my mother's womb, you formed me and you shaped me and you knew me.
[time=1375] You see, life did exist before birth.
[time=1378] That period between conception and birth is real life.
[time=1382] There are other passages in the Bible like John the Baptist, who was in his mother's womb.
[time=1387] Hearing Mary announce that she was pregnant with the Christ, leap for joy in his mother's womb.
[time=1393] These are just a few of many, many references in the Bible.
[time=1396] We want to share with you an excellent pamphlet on a biblical perspective on abortion.
[time=1402] If you were to write to us today, we'd send you this pamphlet absolutely free.
[time=1407] It is simply titled, Abortion.
[time=1409] It is written by Ronald Allen, a fine professor at Western Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary in Portland, Oregon.
[time=1417] He is a scholar, he is a well-read man.
[time=1420] This is not just an emotional argument.
[time=1423] This is a good study of the scriptures and we want to send it to you.
[time=1427] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you a copy, absolutely free.
[time=1431] Our address once again is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1450] Write to us today and we'll send you a copy of this free.
[time=1454] Peter, as we go back to the worship service, what do we look forward to musically?
[time=1459] - We'll look forward to hearing Marsha Ives again, Marsha is a relatively newcomer to our church.
[time=1463] We appreciate her ministry and we look forward to her singing again for us.
[time=1467] - Well, I'm looking forward to that, too.
[time=1469] We trust that you'll write to us today to let us know of your partnership in the ministry and that you're watching with us.
[time=1476] (gentle music)
[time=1491] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=1635] (gentle music) - Thank you, Marcia.
[time=1656] We will recognize our savior because he knows us, and we will know him.
[time=1662] Be able to recognize him by the nail prints on his hand.
[time=1667] You know, the greatest identification won't be that physical resemblance, but it will be the relationship that we have with him spiritually, that we know him today, that we've talked with him, that we've known his counsel, that we've known his mind, that he dwells within us.
[time=1682] That's the hope of the believer today, that Christ lives in me.
[time=1687] Do you have that hope today, if not this morning?
[time=1690] Would you give attention to the spirit of God as he speaks to your heart through a song, through a message, through a thought that he would plant there, the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=1700] Do you know him?
[time=1701] I pray that you do.
[time=1703] Our father, before we open your word, we'd want to open our hearts to you, and ask you to speak to our hearts today.
[time=1711] God, we would want to study your word, so that might be applied to our life, that we might live in a way that is pleasing to you, and fulfilling.
[time=1720] God, today, we thank you, that your word does give that direction.
[time=1724] We ask that your spirit would give the boldness to walk in obedience.
[time=1729] Father, today, our hearts think of those families that are walking through a deep valley.
[time=1733] We pray for Phil Dable, and Barb and Julian, Tom, and Paul, that as they wait, you would wait with them.
[time=1741] God, give them wisdom and decisions.
[time=1743] We pray for a duty, that there might be recovery in our body, that we've not seen.
[time=1748] God, we pray for the Macintosh is that you'll strengthen them as a family, as they rebuild.
[time=1754] God, we pray for him.
[time=1757] Gene Summers, as he faces open heart surgery in these next days, that you'll guide and give wisdom to doctors, that you'll strengthen Roxanne and their family.
[time=1767] Father, we would pray for the hivalies, as Steve recovers from a heart attack.
[time=1771] God, we pray that you would rebuild his life.
[time=1773] As a young man, and as a new believer, may he find you faithful.
[time=1778] Walking beside him through this valley.
[time=1780] God, we pray for Tom and Cheryl, as their baby is in the hospital, that you'd give doctors wisdom as they treat.
[time=1787] God, the burdens of these people in my own heart is great, yet we're trusting you that your grace is greater.
[time=1795] Father, today, we would ask of you that you would use this time of Bible study to strengthen our lives, to renew us, to rejuvenate us, to send us forth with power and confidence in Jesus' name.
[time=1808] [AMEN] When I was a little boy, my sister and I used to love to watch on Saturday afternoon the scary movies.
[time=1816] Do you remember some of those old films, "The Mummy," "The Creature from the Lagoon," "Frankenstein," "The Phantom of the Opera," all those spine-chilling movies?
[time=1827] We used to wear our sweatshirts, the kind with hoods on, when we watched those movies, and we'd put them on backwards.
[time=1833] So our hoods would be in front of us.
[time=1835] And whenever it got too scary, we'd just pull up the hoods.
[time=1838] And I'd say, "Melnie's an all right to look." And she'd say, "You look." I'd say, "No, you look." And we'd have our hoods up there doing this scary part.
[time=1845] Well, that was last year.
[time=1846] I've grown up a lot, and I can watch the scary movies now.
[time=1852] You know, that was just a childish way of hiding from something we didn't want to see.
[time=1857] You know, as an adult, I would feel kind of conspicuous if I was standing up here today with a sweatshirt on backwards.
[time=1864] I do a lot of things backwards, but I try not to put my clothes on backwards, and I started flipping up my hood to hide.
[time=1872] You know, we do that as adults, don't we?
[time=1874] We come to concepts, to principles, to truths that we would rather ignore, so we hide from them.
[time=1883] You know, I think one of the things that a pastor, a Sunday school curriculum, a teacher ought to have, is a commitment to studying the Bible, book by book, our concept by concept, our topic by topic, and not go fishing.
[time=1901] You know, go to the Bible and pull out a chapter and say, "That's it for today, and next week I'll figure out where I'm going next." Because you know where we go to the spots where we're comfortable, to the passages that we know how to talk about, to the ones we know that everybody's going to agree with.
[time=1917] The ones that everyone's going to like.
[time=1920] Many churches preach salvation and salvation only.
[time=1922] We preach salvation.
[time=1924] But I believe we need to learn the whole counsel of God, as well as that message of salvation.
[time=1929] Many preach salvation because they've got it down, and they don't want to deal with some other things.
[time=1934] They like to pull up the hood.
[time=1936] Today we come in our systematic study of the Sermon on the Mount, the Matthew 5, 31, and 32, and it speaks about divorce.
[time=1945] One of the most relevant teachings of Scripture,
[time=1951] but also one of the most controversial.
[time=1954] And before I even read this, I want to suggest that churches, pastors, and few people tend to act like three different types of animals.
[time=1964] Some of us are like porcupines.
[time=1967] Absolutely unapproachable.
[time=1970] We don't mention it.
[time=1971] We don't talk about it.
[time=1973] If you're divorced, God bless you, please go somewhere else.
[time=1977] We don't know how to deal with it.
[time=1979] And so we're always on the defense.
[time=1981] Others are not porcupines.
[time=1987] They're little lizard chameleons.
[time=1990] Rather than sending out quills that say, don't come near me.
[time=1994] They're saying, everybody, come one, come all.
[time=1996] Whatever you are, we are.
[time=1998] I remember at the University of Akron, where I went to college, there was a school newspaper on the back of it that you could write away for your nation papers.
[time=2007] You could become an ordained pastor.
[time=2009] The doctrinal statement was, we believe what you believe if you believe it.
[time=2014] You know, that's how a lot of churches deal with divorce.
[time=2017] We believe whatever you believe as long as you're sincere.
[time=2021] You know, a little chameleon, that little lizard.
[time=2023] If you put it on one of those green plants, you know what color it turned?
[time=2026] Green.
[time=2027] You put them on this brown communion table.
[time=2029] You know what color it turned?
[time=2031] Brown.
[time=2032] You put them on this gold carpet.
[time=2033] You know what color it turned?
[time=2034] Gold.
[time=2035] You know, a lot of churches are like that.
[time=2036] You don't like divorce, neither do we.
[time=2038] You're divorced, that's okay.
[time=2040] You know, they just change to meet whatever the situation demands.
[time=2044] No concept of actual study and commitment to principles, be they be easy to swallow or not.
[time=2050] Well, most churches are like another animal, the ostrich.
[time=2057] Who sticks his head in the ground says, problem?
[time=2059] I don't see any problem.
[time=2061] Matter of fact, I don't see a thing.
[time=2062] Everything's just fine.
[time=2064] They'd like to put their sweatshirts on backwards and pull up their hoods.
[time=2068] Love it today, let's not be porcupines.
[time=2071] Let's not be unapproachable and say, if you have a divorce, don't come.
[time=2076] Oh, you're welcome today.
[time=2079] If you've gone through the tragedy and the heartbreak of a divorce, you're welcome here today.
[time=2083] Let's not be chameleon and say, and if any of you would like to get a divorce, please stop by our council and we'll help you do it.
[time=2090] No, we don't believe that either.
[time=2093] We're not believers in being ostracious and hiding.
[time=2097] So today, let's look at Matthew chapter five and begin our study right here in the Sermon on the Mount, verses 31 and 32.
[time=2106] Jesus speaking, he begins with that familiar phrase.
[time=2109] It has been said, it has been said, whosoever shall put away his wife, let her give her a writing or a bill of divorcement.
[time=2119] But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, commiteth adultery.
[time=2134] Now, before we dig into this, I wanna make a few confessions right up front.
[time=2140] Confession number one is this.
[time=2143] We're not gonna look at every scripture that deals with divorce today.
[time=2147] We don't have time, wouldn't be able for all of us to manage it.
[time=2151] Secondly, we're not going to address every possible situation.
[time=2156] And thirdly, I promise you, we're not gonna promote any easy answers either.
[time=2161] We're gonna take out our shovels and dig into the dirt and see what we can discover in a way of timeless principles that God's word would give.
[time=2171] That familiar statement, it has been said, river references, an old standard.
[time=2176] The new standard is introduced by the phrase, but I say unto you.
[time=2182] It begins with the old statement, the old standard.
[time=2186] It has been said, whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce.
[time=2193] That is what the rabbis, who had the dominant influence in Jesus' time said.
[time=2199] They said, we've gotta have some structure to this divorce business.
[time=2204] And whoever puts his way his wife must have the paperwork done.
[time=2209] No more of this quickie flights to Mexico getting an easy divorce and coming back here.
[time=2214] You gotta do the paperwork.
[time=2216] If you're gonna divorce your wife, you've gotta give her a bill of divorce.
[time=2220] Now that's not what God taught.
[time=2222] That is simply what was said in Jesus' day.
[time=2225] Now how they arrived at that was through the misinterpretation of a key Old Testament passage.
[time=2231] Keep a finger, a church bulletin, or something right in Matthew and turn back to Deuteronomy chapter 24 and verses one through four.
[time=2242] This is one of the earliest passages in all of the Bible that deals with divorce.
[time=2246] Let me read it for you.
[time=2250] Deuteronomy 24, one through four.
[time=2253] When a man had taken a wife and married her and had come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes because he had found someone cleanness in her, then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it to her hand and send her out of his house.
[time=2273] And when she has departed out of his house, she may go and marry another, become another man's wife.
[time=2280] And if the latter or the second husband hates her and writes her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter or the second husband die, who took her to be his wife, then her former husband who sent her away may not take her again to be his wife.
[time=2297] After that, she is defiled.
[time=2300] Now let me give to you what this passage is not saying.
[time=2305] What has been misinterpreted to say how the Pharisees of Jesus day took it the wrong way.
[time=2311] They took this passage of saying that God was saying if a man marries and then he discovers there is some uncleanness in her, he may divorce her as long as he gives her a bill of divorce
[time=2328] and sends her out of his house.
[time=2329] That's how they interpreted this passage to me.
[time=2334] That left them with the challenge of saying what is uncleanness?
[time=2338] Well, there were some very liberal interpretations of uncleanness.
[time=2342] The word uncleanness also means indecent or inappropriate.
[time=2346] So there were those that said my wife had the indecency, the impropriety of speaking in public.
[time=2354] Is that not detestable?
[time=2356] And they would divorce their wives for such uncleanness as speaking in public.
[time=2360] It became so permissive that consistently burning the biscuits was considered inappropriate behavior, becoming a good wife and was suitable grounds for divorce.
[time=2372] Sounds very similar to phrases like incompatibility,
[time=2379] irreconcilable differences.
[time=2381] Basically the concept is captured by the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 19 verse three when they say can a man divorce his wife for any cause?
[time=2391] They took this word uncleanness so broadly interpreted that it was for any cause.
[time=2395] Now, actually, I think it's clear
[time=2401] that they've interpreted this the wrong way.
[time=2404] Let me tell you how Deuteronomy should be interpreted.
[time=2407] Verses one through three simply describe a situation.
[time=2412] It simply gives a circumstance.
[time=2416] Verse four is the only part of this passage that gives principle or commandment.
[time=2423] The rest of it is just circumstantial.
[time=2426] In other words, there was an existing problem in Moses day.
[time=2429] Moses in one through three is describing the existing problem in verse four.
[time=2433] He's telling how to deal with it.
[time=2435] Here's what it is saying, if a man marries a wife and if he divorces her for some uncleanness and if he gives her a bill of divorce and if she leaves his house and if she marries another man and if that man either dies or divorces her, that's all circumstantial.
[time=2455] He hasn't said, you may divorce.
[time=2457] He hasn't said give a bill of divorce.
[time=2459] He hasn't said take another man.
[time=2460] He said, if that happened and now the second husband either divorces or dies, then verse four, the only principle that is being taught here is then the first husband cannot take her back.
[time=2473] It's not giving permission to get a divorce.
[time=2477] It's not giving instruction to give a bill of divorcement.
[time=2480] It is simply saying, here's what's happening in Israel today and if this is true in your life, then don't go back to your first mate.
[time=2487] That's a defilement, that is an abomination.
[time=2490] So all that Deuteronomy is saying, here's an existing problem and if that happens, you can't go back to your first spouse.
[time=2497] Now this has been the interpretation of almost every commentator.
[time=2505] When you come to the Old Testament, probably the most reliable, trustworthy scholarly commentaries on the Old Testament is a set by two authors called Kyle and Dalich, Germans of course with those names.
[time=2517] Now don't run out and buy Kyle and Dalich because it's primarily a commentary on the Hebrew text and about a third of it in German and another third of it's in Latin.
[time=2527] Fortunately, there's a third in English that I can handle.
[time=2531] Let me read you what Kyle and Dalich have said about this passage.
[time=2536] In these verses, divorce is not established as a right.
[time=2541] All that is done is that in the case of a divorce, a reunion with the divorced wife is forbidden.
[time=2552] If in the meantime, she has married another man even though that second husband may have died or put her away by divorce.
[time=2563] Now go back to Matthew five.
[time=2566] What has happened is this, liberal interpretation of the scriptures has said, well, Moses allowed for divorce.
[time=2577] Therefore, when we get a divorce, we just have to do the paperwork.
[time=2581] That's all God requires.
[time=2584] Jesus said, it's been said that all you have to do is give a bill of divorce and you may divorce and he says, but I say unto you.
[time=2594] And he makes this standard that the only grounds for divorce are fornication.
[time=2601] Now, before we dig into this, let me take you to one other important passage of the Bible and that is Matthew chapter 19.
[time=2609] Matthew chapter 19, Jesus makes the exact same statement he did in Matthew chapter five, but in that passage, he also makes some other important statements as well.
[time=2621] Matthew 19, verse three, "A Pharisee came unto him, testing him, saying unto him, "'Is it lawful for a man to put his way, "'his wife, for every cause?" Now, Jesus answered, "'Jesus answered them, "'Have you not read that he who made them at the beginning, "'made them mayon female?' "'And he said, 'For this cause shall man leave his father "'and mother and shall cleave unto his wife, "'and the two shall be one flesh.
[time=2648] "'Wherefore there are no more two but one, "'what therefore God have joined together, "'let not man put asunder.'" Know how Jesus responded to divorce?
[time=2659] Jesus responded to divorce by reiterating the principle of a monogamous permanent relationship.
[time=2666] And that ought to be our first response to any question about divorce.
[time=2671] Is God's plan is a monogamous permanent relationship?
[time=2676] That is God's plan.
[time=2682] That is God's ideal, that was God's original intention.
[time=2686] And that ought to be our first response to divorce.
[time=2690] God's design is permanence.
[time=2692] Now, they said, "Well, wait a minute, Jesus," verse seven.
[time=2697] They said, "And why did Moses then command us "to give a writing and divorce and to put her away?" They said, "Jesus, haven't you read Matthew?
[time=2705] "I mean, Deuteronomy 24, Moses commanded us "that we've got to divorce these people "and we've got to give them a writing "and we've got to send them away." Now, let's notice how Jesus responds.
[time=2718] He said unto them, "Moses, because of the hardness "of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives, "but from the beginning, it was not so." There's three important concepts given there.
[time=2731] In no particular order, let me just address each of them.
[time=2736] First of all, Moses did not command them to get a divorce, to give a bill of divorce, or to put them away.
[time=2743] Jesus quickly addressed that.
[time=2745] He said, "Moses did not command it.
[time=2747] "He suffered it." Many of your English translations will put in the word permitted or allowed, and that's a fair use of the word.
[time=2755] But I honestly like the word suffer better.
[time=2759] You permit something, or you allow something that you have control over.
[time=2763] You suffer with things that you do not have control over.
[time=2769] Moses was not saying, "I've got control of this situation, "and I decide that we'll start having divorces." The divorces were going rampantly.
[time=2779] Moses had to live with it.
[time=2782] He had to suffer with the fact that it was a reality in life.
[time=2785] Note that very quickly.
[time=2789] Moses did not command it, he permitted it, or better yet suffered it.
[time=2793] Secondly, Jesus again says, "God said from the beginning, "no." He reiterates that principle again, and again, and again, from the beginning, it was not so.
[time=2803] And thirdly, he said, "The whole thing is caused
[time=2809] "by hard-heartedness." Hard-heartedness is the point when we become bitter, selfish and resentful, and we say, "I want it my way," or "I want out." No, we not only say that in marriages, we say that in life, every opportunity.
[time=2827] Now Jesus goes on, and he begins to say now what he had said earlier in Matthew 5.
[time=2836] "I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, "accept it be for fornication, "and shall marry another, commiteth adultery, "and whosoever married through has put away "death, commit adultery." Now, I believe that Jesus is here saying, and I can't imagine that it's not clear to everyone, that Jesus is saying there's only one situation, there's only one condition in which a believer can initiate a divorce.
[time=2863] Notice the original question.
[time=2865] Verse three, "Can a man divorce his wife "for every cause, burnt toast, speaking in public, "talking too much, can he divorce her for any cause, "and Jesus said no except for one cause, "can a man initiate a divorce, "or a woman initiate a divorce, "and that is the grounds of fornication." Now, that leaves us with one relatively major task, and that is to say what is fornication?
[time=2895] Well, there are three views.
[time=2897] I'm going to share all of them with you, but I really do not believe the first two hold water.
[time=2902] One view is this, that by fornication, Jesus was referring to that time period between a betrothal and an actual marriage.
[time=2915] In the Hebrew culture, a couple just didn't get engaged and buy a diamond ring and tell everybody in the dorm, and everybody gets excited.
[time=2924] A betrothal period was a specific period of time, that was inaugurated with a contract.
[time=2929] During that betrothal period, it was a number of things, but one of the things it was, it was a time of testing a purity.
[time=2937] And between that first contract, purity would be established, and then a second contract called marriage would be established.
[time=2947] There are those who interpret this as saying that this is a allowance for divorce during the betrothal and the marriage, not after the marriage, and they use a very good illustration.
[time=2960] Can you think of one?
[time=2961] Joseph and Mary.
[time=2963] They were espoused, they were betrothed, Mary is with child, what's Joseph decide to do?
[time=2969] He decides to put her away the divorceer privately.
[time=2973] They required a divorce for that intermittent period.
[time=2978] No, I do not believe that's accurate, and let me give you two reasons why.
[time=2985] First of all, and this reason is enough in itself, the context, does anybody's Bible find the word betrothed, espoused?
[time=2996] No, if you read that Mary is espoused, she is betrothed to Joseph, she's not his wife, he's not her husband, here it says husband and wife.
[time=3007] This isn't betrothal period that's being talked about.
[time=3011] Secondly, when you read the Old Testament law, if a betrothed couple entered into premarital relationship, divorce was not prescribed marriage was, or if a young lady was pregnant during the betrothal period, and it was not pregnant by the one she was betrothed to, she was to be put to death, and that made divorce somewhat an unnecessary step.
[time=3036] Well, I think it's clear that he's not talking
[time=3042] about the betrothal period then.
[time=3044] Well, there's another interpretation that is suggested, and that suggestion is that the word fornication, the Greek word pornia from which we get pornographic, references to two chapters of the Old Testament, particularly Leviticus 18 and Deuteronomy chapter seven.
[time=3064] These were called the pornia laws.
[time=3067] Leviticus 18 made prohibitions against marrying someone too near of kin, meaning you couldn't marry a first cousin, you couldn't marry this relative, you couldn't marry that relative unless they were three times removed.
[time=3081] And if someone married then, Jesus was saying that was a pornia marriage, and you better divorce and get out of it.
[time=3087] Deuteronomy seven talked about marrying foreigners.
[time=3091] The Jews weren't to marry the Moabitis, or the Amalekites, or the Philistines, and if you did, Jesus was saying divorce them.
[time=3099] Now, let me again say that I think that that is an interpretation that just does not fit.
[time=3105] And again, if you go back and you read the Old Testament laws, if someone married too near of kin, the Old Testament law did not say divorce them, it said, "Banish them from the country, set them in exile." So it's inconsistent with what we do know.
[time=3121] Well, finally, let me give you the third interpretation of the word fornication.
[time=3126] It's the one I believe, and I think it's the one everyone who reads it will believe.
[time=3132] The word fornication, in our language, and in the Greek language meant sexual impurity.
[time=3138] It's a broader word than the word adultery.
[time=3142] It's a word that simply means illicit sexual activity.
[time=3147] I believe what this passage is saying is that divorce can only be inaugurated on one grounds, and that is the sexual unfaithfulness of a spouse.
[time=3159] Why do I believe that?
[time=3161] Two basic reasons, one, that is what the word means.
[time=3165] Any other interpretation of that word is somewhat of a grammatical gymnastics meet.
[time=3170] Secondly, in Jeremiah chapter three,
[time=3176] the Bible says that God said to Israel, "You have been an unfaithful wife.
[time=3181] You have played the harlot, and I'm going to divorce you." And so we have by analogy that God's saying, because of Israel's adultery, he was going to divorce them, and that's consistent with what Jesus is saying here.
[time=3195] What have we established then?
[time=3198] For this one hour, we've established that there's only one grounds upon which a believer can initiate a divorce, and that is the sexual unfaithfulness of their spouse.
[time=3209] Now, let me make a couple quick points.
[time=3213] If your spouse has been sexually unfaithful, this passage is not saying you should get a divorce.
[time=3218] It's not recommending it, it's not commanding it, it is simply saying you are free.
[time=3223] What should you do?
[time=3226] I believe you really ought to try to forgive and to rebuild.
[time=3231] But your partner may be so sexually promiscuous that they will not repent and they will not rebuild, but if they do, I believe you ought to seek to be a forgiver.
[time=3240] But you are free, and I cannot deny you that freedom, or do I want to put you in a bind that God has not put us in, you are free.
[time=3248] Now, what I want to do in these last two or three minutes that are ours together is try to apply it very quickly to a few situations.
[time=3257] You may be a victim today, you're divorced.
[time=3261] You were not sexually unfaithful, but your spouse divorced you because of reasons of their own choosing.
[time=3270] Where do you go from here?
[time=3274] If your spouse who's divorced you has been unfaithful, you're free to marry someone else.
[time=3282] If they divorced you and they were unfaithful, you're free.
[time=3286] If they've married someone else, that's an adulterous relationship, you're free.
[time=3290] If they have not, then you should remain faithful
[time=3296] to a marriage even though it's entered into a divorce.
[time=3299] And as 1 Corinthians 7 says, you should remain single and seek to be reconciled.
[time=3305] What if you're a villain?
[time=3308] You're not the victim, you're the culprit.
[time=3311] You're the one who divorced your spouse, and you didn't have this biblical right.
[time=3316] What should you do?
[time=3317] First, you need to recognize it as sin.
[time=3321] Ask God's forgiveness.
[time=3323] And you know what?
[time=3324] He'll forgive you.
[time=3325] God didn't say I forgive every sin except.
[time=3328] He said I forgive, I'll cleanse you of all unrighteousness.
[time=3331] Secondly, if your divorced spouse is able to be reconciled to you, you need to take those steps of reconciliation.
[time=3339] If you cannot be reconciled because they've already married,
[time=3345] then you need to do everything you can in terms of financial responsibility for children and accept responsibility for what you've done.
[time=3355] Most importantly, you need to begin living in obedience today.
[time=3358] God can rebuild your life.
[time=3360] God can forgive you and God can use you.
[time=3362] To a larger group of people, where do you go?
[time=3368] You're saying, "Haks, you told me too late." Or, "I didn't know this, I got a divorce, I got remarried, now I know I shouldn't have, what do you do?" Whatever you do, don't divorce your new spouse.
[time=3378] And people ask that all the time.
[time=3380] That's what Deuteronomy's saying.
[time=3382] You can't divorce your new once you can go back to your old one.
[time=3385] You know what the Bible's saying?
[time=3386] When marriage, even though it was begun wrong, lived right.
[time=3390] Make the best of that marriage you can.
[time=3393] Establish trust by obeying God's word and build a Christian home today.
[time=3398] He'll rebuild you.
[time=3400] This church is full of people who have gone wrong and have turned right and God can rebuild your life.
[time=3407] I began by talking about three animals, an ostrich, a porcupine, and a lizard chameleon.
[time=3417] You know what this church needs to be?
[time=3419] None of those things, it needs to be a bear.
[time=3422] You know what a bear is?
[time=3424] A bear is a strong animal that takes charge of a situation.
[time=3428] Let me tell you what kind of bear to be.
[time=3430] Don't be a big brown bear, don't be a crispy bear.
