[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] The mighty God of the universe, our heavenly Father.
[time=38] He is awesome and he is in Congress.
[time=39] And welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=42] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=49] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=58] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=62] [MUSIC - 237 seconds]
[time=318] - What a joy it is this morning to make that great proclamation, how great thou art.
[time=327] We're delighted today that we can make that statement of heart together.
[time=331] We wanna thank you for worshiping with us this morning here in this auditorium on a cold morning and you look so uncomfortable standing.
[time=339] Why don't we sit down now?
[time=341] And if somebody has to assume a little authority around here and I have just about as little as anybody, today it's about a minus 23 degrees actual temperature and I've heard exaggerated stories of up to about a minus 89 windshell factor.
[time=357] Either way, I hear tell it's cold out there.
[time=360] We are so thankful that you've braved this storm.
[time=363] A number of years ago during a blizzard, we had a grand total of 32 people here.
[time=368] And so today this really seems like a crowd.
[time=370] We're so thankful God has privileged us with having a ministry of television.
[time=375] So on these days when many churches have not been able to meet, we can worship the Lord together by song and by preaching his word and going to homes through the airwaves.
[time=386] We're so thankful today to proclaim the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=389] Probably amongst our very favorite musical guests, our group of young men called sunlight.
[time=395] And we had scheduled them a long time ago and today on a cold day there's still going to be a lot of sunlight in our hearts and spiritually to know that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=406] Singing in our services today as the sunlight trio, we're so delighted that you men are here.
[time=411] Thank you for ministering to us today.
[time=413] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=626] - The sunlight is just reassured us that no matter the struggles that we have in our life, we can be assured that Jesus is ours and he remains with us through the struggles and through the good times.
[time=637] Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.
[time=639] Let's sing just the first dance of him number 51.
[time=643] Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.
[time=652] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=695] - Thank you for singing with us and participating in that aspect of our worship service.
[time=703] Sunlight comes from Nashville, Tennessee, and as soon as they leave Fort Wayne, they're heading for you guest at Florida.
[time=710] I can't imagine scheduling going to Florida in January.
[time=713] Can you?
[time=714] Well, perhaps it was a wise decision, but we wanted them to have this experience of cold weather today so that they would really enjoy their time in Florida.
[time=723] We appreciate the Ministry of Sunlight.
[time=724] Let's listen again as they sing for us.
[time=727] (upbeat music)
[time=737] [MUSIC - 93 seconds]
[time=834] - Ephesians says, what you think about
[time=840] is what you're gonna be.
[time=841] So therefore, think on the good things, like hope, joy, peace, and love.
[time=846] And we wanna do a song about that very thing right now.
[time=849] Think on the good things.
[time=851] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=1047] remember in Fort Wayne it is about -69 windshell factor this morning. I'm glad you made it, Pete.
[time=1054] It was very cold this morning. I think we're very fortunate to have sunlight with us today. That gives us at least a feeling in our inward parts as they sang in the first part of the service,
[time=1064] certainly a certain amount of spiritual warmth. Well we need any kind of warmth we can get but
[time=1070] sunlight truly does provide that spiritual warmth. We're delighted that they're here with us today and because it is so cold outside and listening to the Christian radio stations this morning, it seemed that just about every church in the outlying counties were closed today and many,
[time=1085] many of the ones here in Fort Wayne had either abbreviated their services, started just with one service when they normally have two or in some ways have accommodated the fact that it's so cold here. So perhaps today you're a visitor to the Bible hour. Your church is normally going on,
[time=1101] you've never seen the Bible hour but because your church was canceled you're joining us today and we want to welcome you and thank you for joining us. We're delighted to have you with us. You may not even know who we are or what we're about but we are the Black Hawk Baptist Church and this is Mr.
[time=1117] Kobe our Minister of Music. Are you all prepared for this, Pete? Well often you know you sit here
[time=1123] and wonder how many people are going to be in the choir but we do appreciate our people. They come very faithfully and with special guests that really helps us and we're just grateful that sunlight
[time=1133] is here. I'm sure that we're not totally prepared for a Sunday like this when it comes to offerings
[time=1139] and giving to local churches and that might be something significant for the people that are watching too. You know Pete that is a good point and I'm glad that you brought that up. There are probably
[time=1149] most of you who are watching our church growing people who are normally at your church and your home today simply because it is too cold to be out and may I just give you this encouragement.
[time=1158] As you watch religious broadcasting all morning we're excited about that but please please don't
[time=1164] forget your local church. We do not want you to send your normal tithes and offering to this program or to any other program. We want to encourage you today to take out a stamp before the postage reach go up and send your offering into your home church. Today their bills not only go on
[time=1181] but they go higher. We are heating here about 70,000 square feet Pete and as you walk by the
[time=1187] air handling units that you can hear them working. As a matter of fact most churches bills are going to go up even though they didn't have church today and they're dependent upon your faithfulness so right to your home church tell your pastor that you're standing behind the work of the Lord and send in your tithes and offerings and be a support to your local church today.
[time=1207] Well Pete we have the sunlight back with us again don't we. Yes they'll be singing two or three numbers again before you preach right. Well we're looking forward to hearing that but first of all I want to share with you this booklet on abortion. Today is the day that many Christian organizations are
[time=1224] recognizing the anniversary of the Roe versus Wade Supreme Court decision of 1973. As most of you
[time=1232] are aware that decision by our Supreme Court opened a floodgate of permissivism in the area of abortion
[time=1239] since that time it is almost impossible to estimate how many infant lives were snuffed out
[time=1246] prenatally. The numbers go into the millions and millions it's over a million each year.
[time=1251] We are today recognizing that and praying for this nation that God would bring back a conscience
[time=1259] to this country. If we do not protect the rights of the unborn it will not be long and it probably
[time=1266] is already happening before those who are already born begin to lose their rights as well. It is not
[time=1272] just a political issue this is a biblical issue and we want to send you this booklet on abortion
[time=1279] by Dr. Roland B. Allen. Dr. Allen is a seminary professor at one of the finest schools in this
[time=1286] country western conservative Baptist seminary and Portland Oregon. He has done an excellent study
[time=1293] of the scriptures and from a biblical standard as shared with you and I what God's word has to say
[time=1299] about the life of a child that is yet to be born. We want to send this to you free.
[time=1305] Simply write to us today and we'll send you a copy. Pete would you tell them how they can go about that. Let me encourage you to write to the booklet by writing to the Bible hour box 15,000
[time=1316] Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815. That's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne Indiana
[time=1325] 46815. Thank you Pete and our schedule for tonight called for sunlight being here in concert
[time=1333] and we'd love to invite you all in but we've had to make a decision this morning and we've decided that here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church we will not be having an evening service. Pete and I have talked about it and you never know what's the right thing to do but when everybody else in town is closing down that's probably a pretty good clue as it gets dark about that time it's even going to be colder and so we're going to share as much of their music with you as we can this morning and we'll look forward to broadcasting the Bible hour next Sunday and
[time=1362] worshiping together in the Lord's house as well. God bless you and stay with us now as the sunlight come back to minister to us and song before our morning message.
[time=1392] Oh leave it on the ground we've got to be strong in the power of his might and prove to the enemy
[time=1399] that we're the army of the Lord and we've won the victory.
[time=1408] All around there's a war going on between the wrong and the right we got to choose which side we're
[time=1420] on in the darkness or the light but some of the soldiers of the Lord they just don't realize
[time=1430] that the captain of the army of darkness has blinded their idols.
[time=1436] Oh we're walking into the enemy's camp playing our weapons down Shepna armor as we go leaving it on the ground we've got to be strong in the power of his might
[time=1450] and prove to the enemy that we're the army of the Lord and we've won the victory.
[time=1460] Can't you see that we're in a battle there's no place to hide our shield of faith are full of
[time=1473] darts the shooting from every side just check out the darts and run right at them remember you're
[time=1479] fighting for down fall asleep because if they catch you they'll take a prisoner of war.
[time=1487] Oh we're walking into the enemy's camp playing our weapons down
[time=1493] Shepna armor as we go leaving it on the ground we've got to be strong in the power of his might
[time=1502] and prove to the enemy that we're the army of the Lord and we've won the victory.
[time=1513] Oh we're walking into the enemy's camp playing our weapons down
[time=1528] Shepna armor as we go leaving it on the ground we've got to be strong in the power of his might
[time=1536] and prove to the enemy that we're the army of the Lord and we've won the victory.
[time=1545] Are we walking into the enemy's camp playing our weapons down
[time=1551] Shepna armor as we go leaving it on the ground we've got to be strong in the power of his might
[time=1559] and prove to the enemy that we're the army of the Lord and we've won the victory.
[time=1604] Every day they pass me by I can see it in their eyes empty people filled with care
[time=1624] headed who knows where on they go through private pain living fear to fear
[time=1643] laughter hides their silent crimes only Jesus feels he won't need the Lord
[time=1664] people need the Lord at the end of broken dreams it's the open door
[time=1684] people need the Lord when will we realize people need the Lord
[time=1715] we are called to share his life to a world where one seems right
[time=1734] what could be so great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost through his love
[time=1748] our hearts can feel all the grief they bear they must hear the words of love only we can share
[time=1773] people need the Lord
[time=1779] people need the Lord at the end of broken dreams it's the open door
[time=1799] people need the Lord
[time=1805] people need the Lord when will we realize that we must feel our lives for people
[time=1830] the Lord
[time=1840] people need the Lord
[time=1870] let us pray together our Father we're reminded today of our need for you that each of us need
[time=1882] the Lord Father we think today of the many people who live apart from the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[time=1890] living within their hearts God on this morning that so many are home in the cold and in the snow
[time=1899] perhaps listening by way of television may there be a clear sense and each person's heart of their need for Christ is Savior Father today those friends need the Lord Father today there are people
[time=1912] who have Christ as Savior but they need the Lord walking with them through the valleys of life
[time=1918] God we pray for the many today of this body of people and of this community who need to know that
[time=1927] you walk with them through the valley of the shadow of death Father we think of so many who battle
[time=1933] cancer many battle with hope many battle with the only hope is that Jesus Christ gives eternal life
[time=1940] God may you be a strength to each one of those friends Father we pray for those who've been left
[time=1947] by an accident incapable of caring for themselves in the way they used to
[time=1954] God we pray that you would give strength to families that wrestle with the pain of a tragedy that has struck their loved one God we pray for the tables today that you would strengthen their
[time=1965] hearts we pray today for the Medes as their son lies in a coma we think today of Tim Miller
[time=1976] God we pray that you would raise up the oaths whose bodies have been broken
[time=1982] God today we would pray for the hearts of men and women that there would be a desire to obey you
[time=1989] as marriages and homes fall apart God today we would pray that through your word you would
[time=1996] cause us to know the truth and by your spirit cause us to walk in the truth most of all today God is we think of this nation and its lack of conscience
[time=2009] and its gluttony for self-gratification oh God today we pray that you would spark
[time=2015] within our hearts a revival God as we think of a Supreme Court decision that would legalize
[time=2022] abortion in this land and the literally millions of lives that are taken each year
[time=2028] God we know that you will hold this nation accountable and so we ask that your spirit would
[time=2036] sweep across our hearts and across this land returning to America its sense of values in life
[time=2042] God we thank you for the clarity of your word that teaches that you have ordained life in the womb of a mother that we know today from the reference point of God himself that life exists
[time=2054] in the womb God today we would pray for that conscience returning to this nation
[time=2061] God may we learn as a people that when we obey you a nation is blessed but sin is a reproach to any
[time=2067] people God we ask you to drive that deep within our hearts God we pray for those who would speak
[time=2075] to the issue of abortion that you would give to them boldness combined with graciousness
[time=2083] oh father today we are humbled because of our sins and we stand before you broken
[time=2089] and ask your forgiveness we ask you not only to rebuild a community in the nation but we ask
[time=2096] you to rebuild hearts and lives God we pray for those mothers who have aborted their children and now are afflicted with guilt oh God may they find that you're forgiving may you preach
[time=2109] by your spirit to their hearts that they can have new life and that they're not beyond your love and your forgiveness God to this body of people as we study your word today we invite you to teach
[time=2120] us for it's in Jesus name that we pray amen if you have your Bible with you today we invite you to
[time=2128] open it with us to study the scriptures to the gospel according to Matthew as we're studying
[time=2135] through the Sermon on the Mount we are looking at the teachings of Jesus at some of the most practical
[time=2142] and applicable areas of our life Jesus has spoken about such realities as anger and hatred
[time=2150] lust and divorce he's touching each of us where we live isn't he he's dealing not only with the
[time=2159] actions but the attitudes that set behind those actions as I've observed the scriptures working
[time=2166] in my life and in many of yours it is truly as the writer of Hebrew said a sword that pierces us
[time=2173] begins to cut at us and it separates the very thoughts of our mind from our intentions
[time=2179] God knows us today and his word is a part of that knowing process speaks to the areas of our life
[time=2186] that I would choose to remain hidden this morning Jesus addresses the area of integrity Matthew 5
[time=2195] verses 33 through 39 again you have heard that it has been said by them of old time
[time=2207] thou shall not for swear thyself but shall perform unto the Lord thy knows
[time=2214] but I say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is God's throne nor by the earth
[time=2222] for it is his footstool neither by Jerusalem for is the city of the great king
[time=2228] neither shall thou swear by thy head because thou cannot make one hair white or black
[time=2237] but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatever is more than these cometh of evil
[time=2248] Jesus speaks about an area of integrity about a week ago I attended a pastor seminar trying to
[time=2256] learn some insight that we might be able to use in this body of people and by way of a videotape
[time=2262] I was introduced to a speaker by the name of Dr. Cook he held in this hand a document that came from Harvard University it was a study that was done as to what employers are looking for in
[time=2274] employees it had been a broad study that had been collected from a variety of major corporations
[time=2281] listing their priorities of qualifications that they look for in a potential employee
[time=2289] as I sat there and listened I fell for the trap the speaker said what do you think it is just
[time=2295] tell yourself what it is and I said there's no doubt about it in this high tech age in which we live the thing that an employer must have an employee is technical competence at the skill
[time=2306] for which he or she has been engaged to function I fell for the trap the survey was opened and
[time=2314] number one what most employers looked for in employees was trustworthiness honesty
[time=2323] the list went on through other character traits and it wasn't until number 33 on the list that
[time=2331] you came to technical competence that's really a reflection on our society isn't it
[time=2339] that what is really the missing ingredients isn't skill isn't ability to perform on the job
[time=2345] it's not what we can do it is actually who we are talking with a friend who's involved in
[time=2351] one of the major retail chains in our country he said the problem anymore isn't the shoplifter
[time=2359] it's employee theft we can't trust those that we pay integrity
[time=2366] Brett Hart the famous American writer who wrote such classic works as the outcast of poker flats
[time=2374] baby luck made the comment of the old west that the reason why the west survived
[time=2381] was that a man's word was his bond if a man said he would do something
[time=2389] he would do it Jesus now addresses a group of people about the most practical area of everyday
[time=2396] life truthfulness honesty trustworthiness Jesus begins in the usual pattern you have heard
[time=2406] that it's been said by those of old time and he makes a quote a quote that was popular in his day
[time=2413] the quote went like this now I shall not fail to keep thy oaths but thou shall perform them
[time=2419] unto the Lord by nose actually Jesus is not quoting the Old Testament he's quoting a number of verses
[time=2426] out of the Old Testament putting them together phrases like numbers 20 verse 7 in the 10 commandments
[time=2433] where it says that we're not to take the name of the Lord in vain our place is out of Leviticus
[time=2441] in the book of numbers and other places in Exodus where it tells us that we are to be people who
[time=2447] make a promise and keep it now the historical setting had begun to change as that went from the
[time=2454] lips of Moses through many many generations to Jesus days the religious rabbis of the day had
[time=2460] really distorted the whole issue the whole area of truthfulness was no longer at stake it wasn't
[time=2467] that if you made a promise you were supposed to keep it their major concern was the phraseology
[time=2473] of the promise that was given various rabbis addressed this differently but the bottom line was this
[time=2481] the teaching of Jesus day was if you made a promise and you used the Lord's name in that promise
[time=2489] then you had to keep that promise no matter what but if you made a promise and in that promise
[time=2496] you never referenced the Lord then you weren't obligated to keep that promise so it became the art of the day as to seeing how closely you could associate the Lord with your
[time=2508] promise but really not associate the Lord with the promise so as to make the hearer think that
[time=2514] this is really a valid promise but in case you need a backdoor you kept yourself one for example someone may promise that they will pay you a certain sum of money as the Lord liveth
[time=2526] well if you said as the Lord liveth then you must keep that promise because you brought the Lord in
[time=2533] it but if you said I promised to pay you a certain sum of money and said nothing then people would be
[time=2540] suspicious that you might not keep that and they might not negotiate with you so if you were really a crafty individual you would make promises like this I promise to pay you that sum of money as
[time=2552] Jerusalem is the Lord City well you know the name of the Lord came up but you really just
[time=2559] referenced Jerusalem and described it as the Lord City so it sure sounded good and in case you
[time=2566] needed default on that deal you could say I never referenced the Lord just the Lord City Jerusalem
[time=2575] what they were doing where they were trying to find a legal loophole by which they could
[time=2582] forgo the character of integrity now like in our day in Jesus day the religious leaders tended to
[time=2591] move in two extremes there were those who were very very liberal and they were willing to allow
[time=2598] any oath to be broken so long as the word Yahweh was not included in that so you might say as God
[time=2607] as my witness but if you use the word Elohim you were off because you did not use the proper
[time=2614] name Yahweh then there was another group that were extremely conservative Rabbi Shemi was their
[time=2621] leader they were so committed to truthfulness and integrity you always had to tell the truth
[time=2628] and in their laws they made an illustration of that it went basic like this if a man should see a
[time=2634] bride on her wedding day and she should not be an attractive lady but he said to her on her
[time=2640] wedding day my you look beautiful and he really didn't mean it he was in danger of judgment you weren't even allowed to have a social politeness of saying I hope you have a nice day if you really
[time=2650] didn't want that person to have a nice day you couldn't say to someone that's a beautiful dress if you really thought they overpaid for it they were legalistic on the extreme this group was
[time=2664] permissive on the extreme and they were all arguing about the pettiness of little words that we would
[time=2671] use we say that's really a matter of of of history and I know you like history hawks but what's that
[time=2677] got to do it today you know we encounter this every day so many times we are in areas of conflict
[time=2685] you know what the areas of conflict are because we can't trust each other
[time=2691] someone makes a conversation and in that conversation an agreement is reached then the lawyers are
[time=2702] hired to draw up the documents and the documents vary slightly from the verbal agreement but trust
[time=2709] is there then a conflict arises someone said but you promised and they said ah do you have it in
[time=2721] writing you know and we're always looking for a little loophole and the only thing that we lose
[time=2731] through that loophole is our own character and our own integrity Jesus then made two statements as to how they were to deal with integrity he said you've heard
[time=2745] it said by them of old that thou shall not foreswear thy oath unto the Lord meaning if you've got the Lord's name in there you better live up to it Jesus made two statements statement number one is he
[time=2756] said this verse 34 but I say unto you swear not at all Jesus said don't make any oaths
[time=2769] or statements of swearing now there are those today who would say does that mean that if we are
[time=2777] summons to a court of law and they say raise your right hand and swear after me that we therefore
[time=2783] do not swear someone else says does that mean that we never sign our name and make a pledge or
[time=2789] make a promise is that what it means well there are those that would interpret that way but I think
[time=2796] we need to study scripture a little broader than just looking at this one phrase number of points
[time=2803] first of all the apostle Paul in the scriptures themselves swore now I need to back up and by that
[time=2811] we do not mean he used four letter words by that we mean he swore making a pledge or an oath in the
[time=2818] book of first Corinthians and in second Corinthians and in second Thessalonians Paul used a phrase
[time=2824] as God is my witness that's an oath that's swearing as a matter of fact if you read God's
[time=2834] covenant with Abraham the Bible says God swore by himself because there was no one greater than
[time=2840] him to swear by what did Jesus then mean swear not if indeed God's spokesman in the word of God
[time=2853] made oath of promises and if God himself made oath of promises what did Jesus actually mean then
[time=2859] when he would say swear not well let's read on swear not and now he qualifies that neither
[time=2868] by heaven for its God's throne you see where there was where people who were saying I'm not going to swear by God because I'll have to keep the oath so I'll swear by the heavens and that's really supposed to impress you that I'm serious he said don't swear about the heavens that's God's home if God's sacred then it's home sacred don't swear by your house or anything on
[time=2888] this earth because that's sacred to God that's his footstool don't swear by your head
[time=2897] these were the days before Grecian formed he said none of you can make one hair of your head black
[time=2903] these were the days before Proxide none of you can make one hair of your head blonde
[time=2909] now his point wasn't that that was physical impossibility but you remember playing little
[time=2916] games when you were children you'd make a promise and if you crossed your fingers behind your back
[time=2922] you didn't have to keep it right and when they said you promised you'd say uh-uh I had my fingers crossed now you remember playing other little games that if you step on the crack you break your mother's back you remember that now if you stepped on that crack did it break your mother's
[time=2938] back no no influence over reality and Jesus saying you saying something by way of a promise and
[time=2945] then saying I swear by my head my very life he said that isn't going to change anything to do with
[time=2951] your life he said don't swear by referencing anything other than this one fact Jesus second
[time=2960] statement let your yes be yes and your no be no look at that very closely verse 37 let your
[time=2977] communication be yes yes and your no no was Jesus stuttering at this point you know what he was
[time=2987] saying it was simply saying be a person of such integrity that when you make a promise if you say
[time=2995] yes everybody realizes that you're going to live out that promise no matter what it takes and if
[time=3002] you say no then you're gonna live by that promise no matter what it takes that you're a person of
[time=3010] integrity that you live by what you say as Brett Hart put it a man's word is his bond
[time=3022] I heard a good quote and I'd like to pass on for each of us to dwell on
[time=3033] quote is this commitment is keeping a promise even when the circumstances under which that
[time=3043] promise was given change that's commitment you remember the commitment you made when you got
[time=3051] married if you're married i rick take the catholic to be a my lawfully wedded wife
[time=3061] to have him to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poor in sickness and in health you know i've lived up to that at least 50 percent i provided the worst the sickness and the poor but you know when you stand in front of that pastor and you make
[time=3079] those promises you don't think about the sickness the doctor bills you don't think about the poor
[time=3086] the expense of it you just think about the richer the health the sunshine you don't see the shadows
[time=3095] you know in many of our lives the shadows come the sickness comes the bills come
[time=3101] the poor arrived and we're saying this isn't what i committed myself to character
[time=3107] character says that i'm committed even when the circumstances under which i made that
[time=3114] commitment change that's what jesus meant when he said be the type of person who when they say
[time=3123] yes i'll do it nobody has to go back to check to see if it's done be the type of person if you
[time=3130] promise somebody know that won't happen they don't have to make provision just in case
[time=3137] your character is enough you know having that type of integrity is very very costly
[time=3144] why is it that we are prone to break our word prone to breach character prone to
[time=3153] shade the truth if not completely distorted you know whenever we speak the truth we're in a very vulnerable position
[time=3163] there's no old friend saying that says the truth is only as good as the truth but alive as good as you make it you know that's how we feel sometimes if i use the truth i'm vulnerable
[time=3174] perhaps that's why in our culture we use the phrase the naked truth because when you tell the truth you've got nothing to hide behind i think we're vulnerable and the reason why we don't like
[time=3187] to always tell the truth is because that vulnerability puts us in danger at least two ways
[time=3193] the chief of which is if we tell the truth we may be found out we may be found out you know someone told the story that there are a number of great lies but here are the two greatest
[time=3208] the second greatest lie of all time is oh you didn't get that yet well the checks in the mail
[time=3217] the greatest lies hello i'm from the irs and i'm here to help you what are we saying when someone calls and we say all the checks in the mail and it's really not
[time=3232] i mean it's going to be fast but it's really not yet you know why because we don't want to be found
[time=3239] out the other day we're in a staff meeting and one of the men said who did you invite to
[time=3245] speak for a missions conference and i said well i have invited mr so-and-so but we haven't heard
[time=3251] from him yet and i realized i had to confess to those guys and the reason why we haven't heard from him yet is the letter just went in the mail this morning you know there's such a desire to
[time=3262] cover up make it look like i've done my part i've done what i'm supposed to do if things don't happen it's certainly not my fault cover it up you know there's something that is worse than the
[time=3274] mistakes we make and that is the attempts we make to cover them up i'm not going to pretend to know
[time=3281] more about history than i do it's very easy to say something would have happened that you can't prove
[time=3287] but i believe in 1972 if Richard Nixon would have said yes we did it and it was wrong and i'm sorry
[time=3294] you would have been present for four years and probably had the respect of these people no people didn't lose their respect for what was done they lost their respect when it was tried
[time=3305] to cover up you know usually the mistakes that we make aren't nearly as costly as our attempts to
[time=3319] hide them i think of the classic example of david david was wrong he was a man who was driven by his
[time=3328] own lust he was a man who was given to adultery and to cover it up he conspired and committed murder
[time=3341] why do we make those mistakes because the truth is a rather naked experience
[time=3347] we're vulnerable we're afraid of being found out there's a second reason why i don't like the truth
[time=3356] that is often if we tell the truth we'll suffer loss i mean if the business deal goes through the
[time=3363] way i've got it arranged i'm going to make money on this deal and if everybody finds out all the
[time=3369] details and all the truth i could stand to lose a ton of money well if you really knew what i had said then you may lose your trust or your confidence
[time=3382] and so i'll break your trust and confidence and all i need to cover it up because i don't want to
[time=3389] suffer a loss the scriptures teach us anything it is this there is no loss that is greater
[time=3397] than the loss of character love it there are some things that we can lose
[time=3403] that we can never have back again but there's one thing that we can gain that we can never lose
[time=3410] again and that is the forgiveness of god in jesus christ when jesus made these statements he knew
[time=3416] that we couldn't live up to him that's why i said i'll die for your sins will you open your heart will you receive me i pray that you will
