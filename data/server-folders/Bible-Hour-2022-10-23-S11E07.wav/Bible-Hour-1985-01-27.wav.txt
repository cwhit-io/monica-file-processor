[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=53] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=57] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=64] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=73] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=77] [MUSIC]
[time=100] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=104] What a joy it is this morning to have a church with an auditorium full with congregational members.
[time=111] Last Sunday we took our two morning worship services, combined them together in one, and almost had half of a congregation.
[time=119] With minus 23 degree temperatures and three times that number, windshield factors,
[time=125] it was a cold day.
[time=127] We thank God that we were able to meet and to worship and to take our celebration of God's love to homes and hospitals by way of the Bible Hour.
[time=136] But today, I have to tell you, it's a lot better to see your faces, and to be able to come and to hear you sing this morning.
[time=143] There weren't too many of us here last week, and to tell you the truth, some of us didn't sing too good.
[time=148] But you've sung this morning, and we've begun our worship by praising God today.
[time=152] God is the one who is worthy of every devotion that we can give Him.
[time=157] He's worth our highest praise.
[time=159] That song later on in our worship service this morning.
[time=162] But first of all, we wanted to welcome you both to this auditorium until the television ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=168] We're praying that today, each of our hearts would be strengthened in our faith.
[time=172] Our walk would be deeper in its commitment, and those who've never known Christ personally
[time=178] might know Him today.
[time=180] Our choir leads us in a great anthem of praise that speaks of the believer's relationship to the Lord.
[time=189] [MUSIC - 548 seconds]
[time=891] [MUSIC] Is to give my life to you [MUSIC] Father, if you ask for something rare [MUSIC] I would have tried [MUSIC] And yet you only wanted me [MUSIC] The highest place [MUSIC] Is good and spoken words [MUSIC] And what my heart would say [MUSIC] All I have to offer you in my small way [MUSIC] Is to live for you [MUSIC] For you [MUSIC] The highest place [MUSIC] Not to see and yet believe you died for me [MUSIC] Sometimes in the night I've made you sigh with me [MUSIC] For all you do [MUSIC] The highest place [MUSIC] I can give today [MUSIC] Is to give my life to you [MUSIC] You [MUSIC] Give to you [MUSIC] Good morning and welcome again to the Bible Hour [MUSIC] As many of you know who are familiar with our ministry [MUSIC] We take a few moments away from the live part of our morning worship service [MUSIC] So we can talk directly with you friends who join us for television [MUSIC] Just recently we've started broadcasting in South Bend again [MUSIC] And I'm sure that this ministry is new to many of you [MUSIC] And so allow me to introduce my close friend and working partner [MUSIC] Pete Coby who is our Minister of Music â™ª
[time=1081] - Good morning. - Good morning Rick.
[time=1083] - It's kind of a strange thing probably for the people in South Bend to say here I say good morning but we come in here about 7 o'clock.
[time=1090] It's about 8.30 now but I hope your day's starting well.
[time=1093] - I think we're going to have a good day certainly after last week in the cold weather today.
[time=1098] It's cold but at least it's clear and we're anticipating the people coming in and just having a great time today.
[time=1104] - Well 20 degrees above zero seems like a heat wave today. We're up 43 degrees from last week.
[time=1110] I guess a golf stream has come our way to give us this nice weather and it does seem nice after last week doesn't it?
[time=1117] - I was thankful that we had a special guest with a sunlight last week but I also appreciate the ministry of our own people as the sound foundation just sang
[time=1126] and then Brian Losin is going to be singing just a few minutes and we're really grateful for the musicians that we have in our church and the hard work
[time=1133] and the faithfulness in coming out and ministering and using their talents.
[time=1137] - You know Pete I would be guilty for one of underestimating how much time people put into that ministry.
[time=1143] I just thought if you can sing it and sing and you've waltz up there and you go to it.
[time=1147] But Kathy being a part of sound foundation I know of all the practice times they have and how much she sings at home and listens to the tapes and practices.
[time=1155] It's a lot of work and they do a great job. It takes a lot of work to prepare but I think it's fun too.
[time=1161] We get together and we have some good fellowship and I think it creates an atmosphere where these people really become friends with one another and support one another in other avenues of their Christian lives.
[time=1171] Well we just talked a little bit about who we are because we wanted to get to know you and you to know us for those of you who are new Bible our viewers.
[time=1180] And one of the things that you could do that would be a big help to us is to write us and to let us know that you're indeed watching.
[time=1187] We receive a great deal of mail from our many friends here in Fort Wayne but just recently we have gone on the air in South Bend and then also on a station in Marion, Indiana.
[time=1198] So if you're watching in one of those more distant places to us it would be such a joy for us to hear from you if you would write to us just a note to say we're watching and tell us your impressions of the ministry.
[time=1210] Pete where can they write to? We encourage our listeners to write and would you write right to the Bible our box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1222] That's the Bible our box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1229] As you write we want you to write and specifically request a booklet that we're offering free to you called abortion.
[time=1237] It's written by Dr. Allen of Western Conservative Baptist Seminary and it's an excellent pamphlet explaining what is God's view of this national epic concern abortion.
[time=1251] It's been on the news a great deal lately as to pro-life movements, abortionists, how does this all fit together?
[time=1259] Well this pamphlet is not the final word but Pete it's actually an excellent, excellent presentation of what God's word does have to say about abortion.
[time=1269] Seems like with some days off in this cold weather I've had a little bit more time to watch TV and it certainly is a topic of conversation from coast to coast and pamphlets like this can help the Christian be more aware of what the Bible has to say about it and certainly Rick the Bible does say some things about abortion does it not?
[time=1286] It really does and for many people they think that abortion is something that's brand new that has come on in the last 20 years and before that no one ever heard of abortion.
[time=1297] Well I'm going to bore people with my history, I was a history major, there was a man who lived about 150 years before Christ by the name of Serannus of Ephesus.
[time=1308] And Serannus wrote an extensive, and I don't mean a pamphlet, he wrote an extensive book on gynecology and in that he makes a lengthy list of different chemicals or drugs that could be injected into a pregnant woman that would produce an abortion.
[time=1324] And it was practiced about 150 years before Christ was ever born, abortion was a relatively common practice so it's certainly not new and so it hasn't caught us by surprise if we've been good students of the scripture and good students of history.
[time=1339] And the Bible does speak to abortion in a number of ways.
[time=1343] First of all if we look at the Old Testament we begin to discover that God says I'm in control here and I have regarded the life of the unborn as equal to the life of the born.
[time=1357] In Exodus chapter 21 it deals with if you and I got into fight and you knocked me and I went flying and I hit a pregnant lady and caused her to to miscarry what should happen.
[time=1368] And it says that I'm guilty or we are guilty by that incident of manslaughter if she miscarrys and the baby does not live and it was regarded life for life.
[time=1379] Then also in the familiar 139th Psalm which Dr. Allen looks at extensively, David says God you formed me and my mother's wound.
[time=1388] This obviously we know the biological processes but David said God you knew me, you shaped me, you formed me.
[time=1395] And then I think of the story of Mary who is pregnant with Jesus going to her kinsman Elizabeth who's pregnant with John the Baptist and Mary announces to Elizabeth that she is pregnant with the Messiah.
[time=1408] And the scripture said the baby John leap for joy in his mother's womb, there was life there.
[time=1413] I think that can be documented not only biblically but medically.
[time=1417] Well that's just a little bit of a tease to say we hope that you'll write and receive this booklet.
[time=1422] Just before we go back to the live part of our worship service again tell our friends how they can get it if you would Pete.
[time=1428] Right to the Bible hour for the pamphlet abortion box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1437] That's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1443] Again we want to thank you for joining us and we do hope to hear from you as you request the pamphlet or just write to let us know that you're there.
[time=1451] We're going to go back and Brian Wilson is going to minister to us in song singing No Greater Love, No Greater Love.
[time=1458] I'm looking forward to hearing that. God bless you. Please stay with us.
[time=1481] Love a friend and lover is often sweetly sung but no greater love than the Savior's love can be told by mortal time.
[time=1510] There is no greater love than that of Christ above that made him stoop to earth become a man.
[time=1534] And by his death provide redemption's plan.
[time=1544] There is no greater love. That's why I'm singing of God's love so rich and free.
[time=1564] Revealed at Calvary there is no greater love.
[time=1581] If he had died for angels or seraphim on high, we could understand but amazed we'd stand that for sinners lost.
[time=1608] There is no greater love than that of Christ above that made him stoop to earth become a man.
[time=1637] And by his death provide redemption's plan.
[time=1649] There is no greater love. That's why I'm singing of God's love so rich and free.
[time=1670] Revealed at Calvary there is no greater love.
[time=1697] Thank you Brian for your singing today. Dennis for your accompaniment on the organ.
[time=1702] A reminder to a heart today. There's no greater love will know than one who would say I'll die for you.
[time=1711] Our Father today it seems trite of voice to say thank you for the love gift of your son Jesus Christ who died for our sins.
[time=1721] God we agree with the Apostle Paul that it is an undescribable gift that you've given but this morning we've met to celebrate and to praise you for your great love in redeeming us.
[time=1733] We thank you God that you forgive us our sins, that you love us in spite of our unloveliness.
[time=1741] God today we've come in the name of Jesus to thank you and to praise you for the great salvation that we have.
[time=1748] God we're thanking you today that you give to life purpose and fulfillment that our very beings today have designed our life has value.
[time=1757] God we thank you today that we know why we're here.
[time=1761] God we thank you that we know within our own spirit a sense of dignity.
[time=1768] God we pray for this nation that we might rediscover the value of life that America would cease aborting its children.
[time=1780] God we pray today for conscience to be rebuilt in this land.
[time=1786] Father today we thank you for the blessings you have poured out, the answers to prayer that you have given.
[time=1792] We thank you for those who've come to Christ in recent days. We thank you for the growth in their faith.
[time=1798] And pray for those new believers that your spirit would encourage them that this church would nurture them.
[time=1804] God we pray for those of us who've known Christ for many years that we would not grow weary but we would continue to grow and to serve you.
[time=1815] God we pray that none of us would ever plateau and cease to allow your spirit to lead us.
[time=1821] May we not rest on yesterday's accomplishments.
[time=1824] God we pray for your refreshment, particularly for those who are in physical suffering.
[time=1831] We pray for Harold Robinson with a kidney stone, for Mrs. Fackler with a heart condition, for Diana Bodecker's mother.
[time=1842] God we pray that you would strengthen them. We pray for the stable family that day by day that you would renew their strength.
[time=1850] We pray for Mary Lampman that with each therapy of chemical attack you would give new strength.
[time=1857] We pray for courage for those who wrestle in battle cancer.
[time=1863] God we pray for the hearts of those today who have great health and wealth.
[time=1869] That in the blessings we would not say look what my hand has gained from me but we would recognize your goodness and give you the highest praise.
[time=1877] Father even this morning as we would study your work we ask you to speak to our hearts.
[time=1883] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1889] How do you feel when you read the newspaper and there's a tragic article about crime and into the details that go how a family was attacked and beaten?
[time=1904] How do you feel when you watch the television set and report and grim and graphic pictures of homicides or portrayed?
[time=1917] How do you feel when the radio tells the story of one more child that was adopted or one more woman that was raped?
[time=1925] There's a part of all of us that cringes and dies.
[time=1930] Are you able to identify those feelings? I'll try to identify these feelings.
[time=1937] Honestly how do you feel when you read an article that comes out of New York of a man who was tired of it all and took his gun and put inside his coat and rode the subway
[time=1946] and waiting for someone to attack him?
[time=1950] And then he would retaliate.
[time=1953] Well there's a part of us that cringes but there's a part of us that smiles and says yes, strike out one for justice.
[time=1962] Americans have an appetite for revenge.
[time=1969] The most popular films and the most popular actors are those that are able to picture for us striking back.
[time=1978] Have you ever seen a Clint Eastwood movie where he didn't get the bad guy and he didn't do him just as dirty as the bad guy had done?
[time=1990] Have you ever watched Bert Reynolds, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson?
[time=1997] Movie after movie and those are the best names that draw. You know what the movies are always about striking back?
[time=2004] Because there's a part of us. There is a part of me that says my name is Hawks and I don't get mad. I just get even.
[time=2013] Maybe you've done this. You remember someone that hurt you.
[time=2016] It may have been five years ago. It may have been ten years ago.
[time=2019] You may not have even seen the person in the last ten years and you're driving down the street and suddenly your mind like a videotape player replays that story.
[time=2026] And all of a sudden you're back and you're saying I should have said this. That would have really got him.
[time=2033] Striking back.
[time=2036] What did Jesus say about striking back?
[time=2039] Matthew 5, open your Bibles with us this morning to verse 38 that we can study together today, another section out of the sermon on the Mount.
[time=2051] Matthew 5 verses 38 through 42. What did Jesus say about striking back?
[time=2061] You have heard that it hath been said and I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[time=2070] But I say unto you that ye resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also.
[time=2081] And if any man will soothe thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
[time=2090] And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two, give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.
[time=2106] In this passage Jesus speaks about striking back.
[time=2110] An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
[time=2113] He begins by restating the old standard. What did the law say? What was the old reference point?
[time=2119] He said, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is a very ancient saying.
[time=2125] It was called Lex teleonus by the Latin, or the law of the claw.
[time=2131] It speaks of the might of a claw that would reach out and extract justice.
[time=2137] It was first found to the best of our archaeological finds in the code of Hammurabi, the Babylonian king of approximately 2000 BC.
[time=2147] An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and that's how Babylonian justice extracted it.
[time=2153] That if you and I were in a fight and you hit me and my eye was lost in that fight, then I could take you to court and sue you.
[time=2163] And if you were found guilty, then your eye would be removed.
[time=2167] That's justice. That's the law of the claw.
[time=2172] If you, by accident, not meaning any evil, would bump into me and I would fall and it would knock out my tooth,
[time=2182] and the judge would find that to be true, then you would be taken to Dr. Yang, who would remove your first molar.
[time=2189] It's justice. Tooth for a tooth.
[time=2193] It was the Babylonian way of dealing with it. Let's be honest.
[time=2198] The Old Testament contains that statement three times.
[time=2203] Once in Exodus, in Leviticus, and again in Deuteronomy, it says, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
[time=2210] And before we even get into the new law, let's take a closer look at the old law.
[time=2214] What is God saying? Moses, if your brother steps on your foot and it breaks a toe, then you take your rock hammer and you just whack him on that toe, and tooth for tooth, toe for toe.
[time=2227] That what God was saying was God instituting a system of vengeance and a bodily mutilation? No, he wasn't.
[time=2236] When the Bible said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," first of all, "that was given as a limitation on revenge."
[time=2246] So that a man would not say, "You hit me and that hurt me, therefore I'm going to break your arm."
[time=2253] Or, "You hit me and it knocked out my eye, therefore I'm going to take your life."
[time=2259] In our modern sense of jurisprudence, it's what we say, "Let the punishment fit the crime."
[time=2266] It was given as a limitation on justice.
[time=2269] Secondly, it was not given to authorize a personal vendetta.
[time=2273] This was given to Moses, as if you will, the government, the governor ruling over people,
[time=2279] establishing judges over the people and giving prescription to the rulers.
[time=2283] It wasn't giving each individual the personal right of vendetta.
[time=2289] Even though the people wanted that, God would not give it.
[time=2292] Even to protect people, God set up cities of refuge, where a person who was not guilty of a crime
[time=2298] was being pursued on personal vendetta could go and it was the city's responsibility to provide refuge in protection.
[time=2306] But what God was actually saying here to these judges was that they were to reckon each injury
[time=2314] and to compensate that proportional to the injury.
[time=2318] And the Hebrews completely understood this and used a monetary system just like we did.
[time=2323] So that if by injury I received the loss of an eye, and I would go to the court, the court would not take the individual who was culpable and gouge out his eye, but they would say, "You caused the loss of this man's eye; therefore you must pay for that, and in our society we have deemed an eye to be worth this many dollars, and you must pay."
[time=2345] That was the Old Testament. That was the Old Standard.
[time=2349] Jesus said, "You've heard it said, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and now his very familiar statement, "But I say unto you, but I say unto you."
[time=2361] Each time Jesus makes that statement, "I say unto you, he does two things." First of all, he always elevates the existing standard of the law.
[time=2371] When they asked him about divorced, he elevated the standard.
[time=2379] When they asked him about capital offenses, he elevated the standard, and he's going to do that again in this situation.
[time=2385] Secondly, Jesus not only elevated the standard, but he always took the focus
[time=2391] and removed it from the details of the law and of external performance
[time=2398] and focused the attention on the internal values of attitudes.
[time=2402] And again, he will do that.
[time=2405] In giving a new standard, Jesus makes one general statement and follows it by four particular descriptions.
[time=2413] His general statement is this, "Do not resist evil." That is a general statement that Jesus would give.
[time=2421] Following that general statement, he now describes what he means by "Do not resist evil." First illustration.
[time=2429] He says, "If a man slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him also the other cheek."
[time=2437] Now the context of this situation is not primarily two men who are fighting each other.
[time=2443] It's not primarily what you do if someone jumps up unexpectedly, begins to attack you.
[time=2448] It's speaking of insult.
[time=2451] In the ancient world, and even in the early days of the settling of this country, if a man verbally insulted another man, verbally insulted him, be it intentionally or unintentionally, and the man took offense, he would walk up to the individual
[time=2468] and he would slap them in the face, saying, "You've insulted me and I am now escalating this
[time=2475] with a slap in the face, and if you are any kind of man, you will slap me back,
[time=2481] and that will be the basis for a duel, a brawl, whatever it takes.
[time=2487] This is to institute the battle. I'm going to slap you in the face, insult."
[time=2493] Jesus said, "If a person comes up and for some reason or another slaps you in the face and challenges you, resist the temptation, the strike back, and turn the other cheek.
[time=2508] Expose yourself. Make yourself vulnerable." There's nothing that makes us more vulnerable when someone has a raised hand than to keep our hands at our side and to turn our face and make it available.
[time=2525] Jesus was saying, "Make yourself vulnerable to insult." That was his first illustration of what he meant by "Do Not Resist Evil." Secondly, he says, "If someone takes you and is suing you for, I like the word tunic
[time=2539] that the new international version uses, then give to him also your cloak." In the ancient world, they had primarily two pieces of clothing, a tunic, which was a thin cotton linen garment that was worn right against the skin.
[time=2553] Then they had a second garment which was called a cloak.
[time=2557] It was a larger, thicker, probably made out of an animal skin or a thick weave
[time=2563] that would be wrapped around the individual as an outer garment that would also double up, if you will, as a sleeping bag.
[time=2570] A man could lay that out on the ground, lay on one side, it would be big enough, he could pull it over him, and it was not just his outer garment to keep him warm, it was also his sleeping bag.
[time=2581] Now, Jesus says, "If a man has got some reason, some point of legal battle with you,
[time=2589] and he says, "I'm suing you and I'm suing you for your tunic." The shirt off your back, Jesus said, "Don't just do that and give him your tunic,
[time=2599] give to him your cloak also." Now, was Jesus instituting the first streaking adventure in history that you give him all your clothes? And that's all they had.
[time=2609] No, that wasn't his point at all. His point was this, your tunic is the lesser valuable of the two garments.
[time=2616] The outer garment was so valuable that in the Old Testament, if you took someone's outer garment, their cloak as a down payment or a surety or earnest payment in a contract, you had to give it back by nightfall.
[time=2629] Jesus was saying, "If someone is suing you and they're asking for the equivalent to your lesser garment, then to settle the dispute, give him your outer garment, give him more than he's asking for, but don't resist it, settle the dispute." Third illustration that Jesus would give is not of a civil suit but of conscription.
[time=2650] The Romans were very domineering of the people they conquered.
[time=2655] Some came in, extracted taxes and were never to be seen again.
[time=2658] The Romans occupied the land.
[time=2661] And they conscribed or forced people into various services on a moment's notice.
[time=2667] You could be walking up the high climb from Jericho to Jerusalem and you were in a hurry to complete your journey.
[time=2675] And in the process of that journey, here would come a Roman legion marching the other way and they had a lot of supplies that they were carrying.
[time=2683] They could say to you, "You carry this back to Jericho." And you're saying, "I've got to get to Jerusalem. I've got to deadlines." My company said, "This has got to be there in 24 hours. I'm the closest thing to federal express.
[time=2694] I've got to go." You had to turn around and go back.
[time=2698] Now, Roman law did protect even the conquered people that they only had to go one mile.
[time=2706] Now, Jesus says, "If you are conscripted to go your mile, go to. Go to."
[time=2719] You know, there's an illustration of that in the Bible.
[time=2723] Jesus is carrying his own cross. Having been beaten and abused for about 24 hours,
[time=2730] he literally falls and collapses on the Via de la Rosa.
[time=2737] And a man standing there, either watching or bystanding, is conscripted.
[time=2743] And Simon, less Iranian, carries the cross of Christ.
[time=2750] The Romans, by law, could say carry it a mile. Jesus would say, "Go to."
[time=2757] His fourth illustration is this.
[time=2759] If someone comes and asks money of you to borrow it from you, don't turn them away.
[time=2764] Lend it to him. In the Old Testament, if a man was to loan money to a fellow Israelite,
[time=2771] he would loan that money to him. And it was to be interest-free.
[time=2775] He allowed to charge interest of a foreigner, but not of a brother.
[time=2780] Now, in their calendar, they had a seven-year cycle.
[time=2784] And every seventh year, all debts were forgiven.
[time=2788] So if you come to me and you say, "Hocks, I'd like to borrow a few shekels, and I have a few shekels for the loaning." I may look at the calendar to say, "Oh, I don't know.
[time=2798] This is the sixth year of the cycle, and six months, all debts are forgiven." And I may say, "I don't think I can do that." And I become reluctant to loan you what you need, and I have ability to do that, because I'm afraid you won't pay it back in the next six months.
[time=2815] And then, in six months, the priest is going to stand up, announce the year of debt forgiveness, and all debts are forgiven, and I'm out of my money.
[time=2824] Why don't you come back in 18 months? Let me think about it for a while.
[time=2828] And then we'll be in the first year of this cycle and share all the money.
[time=2831] Six years, you'll pay it back.
[time=2834] They not only had this seven-year cycle, but every seven years of the seven-year cycle, meaning 49 years, the next year was called the year of Jubilee, and not only all cash debts were forgiven, but all bondage on the land was forgiven.
[time=2848] If I fell into financial reverses, and I needed to sell my land to you,
[time=2854] and I mean sell it to you so that I would have money to exist off of, then every 50 years, that land returned to my family.
[time=2863] If I lived that long, it came back to me.
[time=2866] If I had died, it would go to my oldest son.
[time=2868] If he had died, it would go to his oldest son, but the land came back to the family.
[time=2873] That was God's way of protecting Israel from feudalism.
[time=2877] And so there would be people saying, "I am not going to get, you know, you want to sell your land to me, but, you know, in two years, I got to give it all back." It was a bad business deal, and so people were protecting themselves at the expense of a brother who was in need.
[time=2893] Those are Jesus' illustrations of what it means to be generous and to not resist evil.
[time=2900] Now, in the moments that remain, I want to very quickly tell you what this passage is not saying, because I think it's one of the more misused passages in the Scripture, and then a few things as to what it is saying.
[time=2912] You need to understand this key principle right up front.
[time=2916] What Jesus is saying here, he's saying to you and to me as individuals.
[time=2921] He's not saying it to the Fort Wayne Police Department, the Allen County Sheriff's Department, or to the United States government.
[time=2929] This is personal ethics, not government.
[time=2933] You must make that distinction or you'll be misled.
[time=2937] Now, here's what this passage is not saying.
[time=2940] This passage is not saying that society should not punish its criminals.
[time=2946] If I'm walking down the street and suddenly a man holds me up at knife point
[time=2953] and is about to stab me and rob me of the $3.13 I have on me,
[time=2960] I hope that the deputy sheriff who walks by and sees that will not say,
[time=2966] "Sir, we've really tried to avoid that type of behavior in our society, and I've got to be going, but I just hope that you'll take this as some good advice, and I'm not supposed to resist evil." Well, God bless you and happy honing.
[time=2981] That's not what the role of police is, that's not what the role of government is.
[time=2985] Romans 13 makes it very clear that government exists by ordination of God to do two things, one to promote good, and two to be a terror to evil.
[time=2996] It's government's job to find those type of individuals, incarcerate, control, and punish.
[time=3004] Second thing this passage is not saying.
[time=3007] This passage is not saying that national defense is bad.
[time=3012] Again, this is saying to me as an individual how I am to operate.
[time=3017] It's not saying that we should not have a strong national defense.
[time=3021] Again, God has instituted government, and government is not only to promote good within
[time=3027] and protect from evil within, meaning crime, but it's to protect evil from aggression from without.
[time=3034] Now, that's not to say that every policy that this country passed or presently is embracing is correct,
[time=3040] but it is saying that this passage is not saying there is not to be military protection.
[time=3048] It's not what Jesus was teaching here at all.
[time=3051] Ecclesiastes recognizing the human nature says there is a time for peace, but there is also a time for war.
[time=3060] Third thing that this passage is not saying, it's not saying that we are not to defend ourselves.
[time=3067] It's not saying that if we are being attacked, if we are being sued, that we are not to use self-defense and normal legal systems.
[time=3075] Do you know that Jesus used the normal legal system in his trial?
[time=3079] For the most part he kept silent, but he said something and the high priest didn't like it, so he had Jesus slapped in the face.
[time=3086] In John chapter 18 you discover that Jesus reminds the high priest of the law.
[time=3092] He used the law to defend himself.
[time=3094] You weren't allowed to slap an innocent man. Jesus had not been tried yet. He was still innocent.
[time=3099] You'll discover that Paul, as he went to the city of Ephesus, was beaten.
[time=3104] And the Roman officials then discovered that he was a Roman citizen and it was illegal to beat a Roman citizen.
[time=3111] They became very accommodating when Paul pointed out that technicality.
[time=3115] When a kangaroo court was established in Jerusalem, Paul just looked him in the eye and said no.
[time=3120] I appeal to Caesar.
[time=3124] What is this passage saying?
[time=3128] Let me share with you at least five things that I think Jesus most wants us to take home and to live out.
[time=3135] I think what Jesus is saying first of all is this, do not succumb to a spirit of revenge.
[time=3143] It's in there folks. It beats within my chest, strike back, get even.
[time=3151] God said don't succumb to it. Don't resist evil. Most of all, Romans says do not resist evil with evil.
[time=3160] Don't succumb to a spirit of revenge.
[time=3163] Secondly, I believe Jesus was saying be willing to accept insult and injury.
[time=3172] You know, when someone encroaches upon, I like the phrase that we use it so much today, my personal rights.
[time=3185] You know what really is flaring up? It's my pride. It says who do you think you are?
[time=3189] Who do you think you are? You know what that phrase really means?
[time=3192] When we out of anger says who do you think you are, we really say who do you think I am?
[time=3197] That should happen to me. I am somebody.
[time=3202] The Bible here says be willing to accept insult and injury.
[time=3207] Don't escalate it by striking back.
[time=3212] Thirdly, I believe Jesus was saying be willing to suffer loss, to settle and dispute.
[time=3220] Tonight, we're going to look at that area in length.
[time=3225] The whole process of suing, where I get from you what I want because you have done something to me.
[time=3232] Jesus says if you're in the middle of that, be willing to suffer loss.
[time=3236] They want you tunic, give me your coat.
[time=3240] It doesn't sound very appetizing to me, but you know what?
[time=3243] When we adopt that spirit and we become winsome, the Bible says that God's peace in our heart
[time=3249] our gracious spirit will cause even our enemies to be at peace with us.
[time=3254] Be willing to suffer loss.
[time=3258] Fourthly, I believe Jesus is saying this.
[time=3263] In the face of injustice, be gracious.
[time=3275] When that Roman says go one mile and your miles up, go to.
[time=3283] Be gracious.
[time=3285] Even though it's unjust, even though it's unfair, if you're gracious, you'll win your enemy to your cause.
[time=3296] I'm not saying it's easy.
[time=3298] I'm not even saying I do it.
[time=3300] I'm just saying it's right.
[time=3303] Be gracious in the face of injustice.
[time=3308] Finally, I believe Jesus is saying this.
[time=3313] Be generous and open-handed.
[time=3321] It's an old illustration, but it holds true.
[time=3325] That when our possessions are in our hand and we close our hand tightly to hold on to it,
[time=3331] that our hand is no longer open for God to fill it.
[time=3335] It's not until we open our hand with generosity, a spirit of sharing that what we possess,
[time=3342] that it's open that God can fill it.
[time=3345] But you see, when we close it, we're saying this is mine.
[time=3349] We're also saying, "God, you can't trust me." And God said, "I can't put more there." But when we open our hand, we're saying, "God, I'll share.
[time=3359] I'll be responsible. I'll be generous.
[time=3362] I'll give as I'm instructed." Then God says, "Your hand is open. I can trust you.
[time=3368] I can fill it." What did Jesus say about striking back?
[time=3374] He said five things.
[time=3376] Don't succumb to the desire of revenge.
[time=3380] Be willing to accept injustice and injury.
[time=3386] Be willing to suffer loss, to settle or dispute.
[time=3390] In the face of injustice, be gracious.
[time=3394] Finally, be generous and open-handed.
[time=3399] Lived up to that?
[time=3401] I haven't.
[time=3403] None of us have.
[time=3405] Yet God says, "If you don't live up to this righteousness, you can't see the Kingdom of Heaven." How are any of us going to see it?
[time=3412] Only by the righteousness that Jesus gives.
[time=3414] God said all of this so that we would know we can't earn or deserve His favor that we're all sinners.
[time=3421] So that by His standards, we'd see we fall in short and we'd humble ourselves and say, "God, I need a Savior. I need your Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3430] You sense you need Him today.
[time=3432] Would you open up your heart?
[time=3434] Would you receive Him?
[time=3436] I pray that you will."
