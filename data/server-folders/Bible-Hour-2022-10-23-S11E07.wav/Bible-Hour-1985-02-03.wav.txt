[time=0] [bell]
[time=30] >> Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=54] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=61] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rickoff.
[time=71] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=75] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=147] >> Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=154] [MUSIC - 77 seconds]
[time=244] [APPLAUSE]
[time=250] >> Thank you, Bell Choir, for that great, and Tifano called a worship as we would hear bells ringing from side to side.
[time=258] It almost surrounds us with the sound that the bells ring that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=264] We've assembled this morning that we can declare that He lives, and that He lives within our hearts, not only in heaven to where He's ascended, but He lives within our hearts today.
[time=274] We welcome you to our second worship service today, and trust that God will use this as an opportunity for you to ascribe personal praise and a time when each of us can grow in our relationship with Christ.
[time=286] We also welcome our friends who join us each week for the Bible Hour, and pray today that God would use this in each life as a strengthening point.
[time=295] Today we hear our choir sing a hymn that we probably sang often as children, but it's so valuable to us as adults.
[time=302] The challenge, the admonition, to stand up for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=306] As soldiers of the cross, we're to serve Him, to never be ashamed, but boldly and graciously to proclaim that He is our Lord.
[time=314] Stand up for Jesus.
[time=317] [MUSIC]
[time=325] Stand up for Jesus, He's soldiers of the cross.
[time=333] We're tied as royal banner.
[time=337] It must not suffer loss.
[time=341] From victory unto Mary.
[time=345] Fits are me, shall we leave.
[time=359] Soldiers of Christ are wise and put your armor on.
[time=367] Strong in the strength which God's of light, through His eternal Son.
[time=375] Strong in the Lord of Hosts, and in His mighty power.
[time=384] The way of strength God Jesus does is more than from the Lord.
[time=394] With on the Lord's side, the will serve Him.
[time=402] Who will be His Hebrews?
[time=407] Father lies to be.
[time=411] Who will be the world's side?
[time=415] Who will face the fall?
[time=419] Who is on the Lord's side?
[time=423] Who forever?
[time=428] I find all whom there is in my mighty mind.
[time=438] We are another time, say your we are gone.
[time=457] Say your we are gone.
[time=471] What a privilege to serve the Lord today and to carry His banner in lifted high.
[time=481] Let's continue that theme as we sing together Him number 623, the banner of the cross 623.
[time=515] God bless God.
[time=520] Who bless the land in the halls?
[time=525] Who will be His name in the land of the cross?
[time=534] Who will be His name in the land of the land of the center?
[time=559] Who will be His name in the land of the cross?
[time=569] Who will sing the Lord to stand with me together?
[time=574] Who will be His name in the land of the center?
[time=615] This is the first Sunday of February and we begin a new month and with that new month, a new ministry that we want to focus our attention on.
[time=624] In January, we focused on the ministry of Sunday school and ended that last night with a tremendous banquet of appreciation for our elementary staff and junior high and high school staff.
[time=635] This month, we want to focus on the ministry of stewardship.
[time=639] I'm reminded of a quote by Jim Elliot, the famous missionary to the Aka Indians.
[time=644] Jim said, "He is no fool who gives up that which he cannot keep to gain that which he could never lose."
[time=652] That's a great introduction to stewardship.
[time=654] Stewardship is recognizing that our life is to be lived with a sense of eternal values
[time=660] and to recognize that God owns me.
[time=664] And anything that I have, I have time, if I have talent, if I have any treasure,
[time=670] it all belongs to God and He has made me and He has made you His trust officers,
[time=676] which simply means that we are overseeing and managing the very life that He's given to us.
[time=681] Many times, people say that churches are ministries.
[time=685] They're always asking people to donate your time, come in and help.
[time=689] Usher, teaching the Sunday school, singing the choir.
[time=692] It seems that churches and ministries are always asking for time.
[time=696] And if it's not time they're asking for, then you can be sure they're asking for money.
[time=701] Well, one man by the name of Alan Redpath, Dr. Redpath was the pastor of the great Moody Memorial Church,
[time=709] a generation or two ago, gave a tremendous insight into that.
[time=714] Dr. Redpath told of a friend who had a son, and that son, when he was born,
[time=720] began to demand a lot of time from his parents.
[time=723] They had to change diapers at all hours of the day, feed, burp, and clothe.
[time=730] The child demanded time, and it seemed that the older he got, the more time that he demanded.
[time=736] Mothers turned into chauffeurs. Fathers turned into little league coaches.
[time=740] And it was time always being demanded.
[time=743] It seemed the older the child got the more money he demanded.
[time=746] Doctors bills, clothing, outgrowing shoes before they got him on the second time.
[time=751] It just seemed that the child demanded time and money all the way through life.
[time=755] By the time he went to college, it was more money and more time.
[time=759] And then that child died.
[time=762] And the father said he hasn't cost me a penny since then.
[time=766] He hasn't taken any of my time.
[time=770] You see, beloved, anything that's alive takes time, takes effort,
[time=776] takes investment of ourselves and of our financial resources.
[time=782] If a church in a ministry is alive, it's going to ask for your time.
[time=787] It's going to ask for the investment of your talent.
[time=793] This month we focus on stewardship.
[time=795] Let us begin by recognizing these two things that all that we have and all that we are belongs to God.
[time=801] And secondly, if a ministry is alive, it's going to take our investment.
[time=806] We have two people who are from our church who have invested their lives in ministry.
[time=810] Keith and Starr Bradigan are home from IU, where Keith is working on a doctorate degree in music.
[time=816] And they're here to minister to us today.
[time=818] Welcome. We're delighted that you're here.
[time=848] [MUSIC]
[time=878] My faith was firm and strong, burning right, peering wrong.
[time=894] But now it's not the way it used to be. Something's changed inside of me.
[time=911] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[time=923] Restore to be the joy of each new day.
[time=936] Give me back the love that I once met for you.
[time=947] And never, ever, ever miss you.
[time=961] I used to speak your words through my lips.
[time=975] Your voice was heard.
[time=979] There were so many men who came my way.
[time=987] I could help find a way.
[time=997] But now my words are called, joy is gone, love is owned.
[time=1009] And while because I try to live alone, bring me back, make me home.
[time=1025] Restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[time=1037] Restore to be the joy of each new day.
[time=1049] Give me back the love that I once met for you.
[time=1060] And never, ever let me slip away.
[time=1073] Jesus, how I need you every day.
[time=1089] Again, we want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=1093] We're so excited to have Keith and Starr back home with us today.
[time=1097] But we're equally as excited that you're joining us for this ministry today.
[time=1101] Along with me today is a good friend and associate George Lampman.
[time=1105] Good morning, George.
[time=1106] Good morning, Rick.
[time=1107] Many of our people probably know who you are because you're with us on Sunday mornings and they may catch a glimpse of you on the stage or have seen you before.
[time=1115] But many of them probably don't know that you're one of our pastors here taking care of the hospital visitation,
[time=1121] pastoral care and a special ministry called Super Sixties.
[time=1124] Tell our friends first about Super Sixties, please.
[time=1127] I would like to, Rick, Super Sixties is a ministry to senior adults.
[time=1132] And we call it 55 to 105, the age limit.
[time=1135] We might raise that if somebody comes in a little older.
[time=1138] But we meet each Friday and we have a great time.
[time=1140] We have fellowship and we have an encouragement time and we have a spiritual blessing.
[time=1144] Different programs and it's just a great time.
[time=1147] So I'd encourage each one who is a senior adult to come and join us.
[time=1151] Well, that's an exciting ministry and we do want to invite you here every Friday morning at 10 o'clock for Super Sixties.
[time=1158] That weekly fellowship that George told you about is somewhat of a basic program.
[time=1162] And from that, they take trips.
[time=1164] I was going to say all over the country because they've been to Florida and the world's fair.
[time=1168] But it's literally all over the world because they're making their second trip to Israel coming up in just a few months.
[time=1174] Yes, we are, Rick.
[time=1175] And that trip is going to be an exciting trip as far as I'm concerned.
[time=1179] We're going to be leaving New York on April 22nd and coming back May the 5th.
[time=1183] It will concentrate on the land of Israel.
[time=1186] And that's the most exciting land because of the Bible just unfolds right before you.
[time=1191] We'll be going from Dan, the Northern part of Israel, to Berchiba, the very South.
[time=1196] And we'll be going across the Sea of Galilee.
[time=1198] Areas where Christ and His disciples walked and ministered.
[time=1202] Boy, that's exciting.
[time=1204] And we're today inviting you to join George and Mary Lantman from our church and their host, Dr. and Mrs. Jeremiah,
[time=1212] who've been there some 13 times, is that right?
[time=1214] Yes, that's right.
[time=1215] So they're very capable experienced leaders.
[time=1217] George, people are obviously going to know what a cost is for a trip like this.
[time=1222] Yes, I think the cost is very reasonable, Rick.
[time=1225] This cost, complete cost from New York on back to the States again is $1,484.
[time=1231] Boy, that's a good deal.
[time=1233] And if you would like to go on this trip, you can simply, I believe, just call you or your secretary here at the church, right?
[time=1240] That's right, Rick.
[time=1241] Trying to make that as easy as possible.
[time=1243] So if you would like to join George and Mary along with the Jeremiah's and their trip coming up in April and May to the Holy Lands,
[time=1251] just call us at 749-8524, Monday through Friday.
[time=1256] And George or his secretary will be glad to give you more information and send you to brochure.
[time=1262] George, thanks for being with us this morning.
[time=1264] Thank you.
[time=1265] I'm glad to be here.
[time=1266] We're glad that you're here every day and our television people just get to see you today.
[time=1270] Last week, we offered you a pamphlet on abortion if you would simply write in and ask for it.
[time=1275] Today is the last day we're going to make that booklet available simply because there are other things we want to share with you in the future.
[time=1282] As we've mentioned to you in the past, abortion is very much of a biblical issue.
[time=1287] It's not a new occurrence, it's thousands of years old, the Greeks before the birth of Christ even were practicing abortion.
[time=1295] Now, what we want to do is to share with you the fact that this is a biblical concern.
[time=1300] The Bible is very clear on this subject that it expresses without any doubt that life in the womb is considered by God to be life indeed.
[time=1310] It's not something that we call a prenatal blob or fetal tissue, it's life, and God's concerned about that.
[time=1320] And we want to share this booklet with you.
[time=1322] It's not one that deals with social or political action.
[time=1325] It's a Bible study to show you what God has to say.
[time=1328] If you'll simply write to us, we'll send you this book free.
[time=1331] The address that you need to write to is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1341] Once again, the address is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1351] We hope that you'll write to us, request that pamphlet today.
[time=1354] Now we're going to go back to the live part of our morning worship service, and we'll have the privilege of hearing from Keith and Starr once again as the Brodygum's minister to us in music.
[time=1364] If you're here in Fort Wayne, we want to encourage you, if you don't attend church in the evening, to join us tonight, as we'll be talking about political action, the Christian's response.
[time=1376] That's tonight here at Black Hawk Baptist Church at six o'clock.
[time=1380] Thank you for joining us. Now listen to the ministry of the Brodygum's.
[time=1384] [MUSIC - 161 seconds]
[time=1569] Thank you, Keith, for your accompaniment today. We trust him today because he loved us so.
[time=1578] Our God and our Father, we bow before you today out of worship.
[time=1583] God, we've assembled in this place to declare that you are God and you are worthy of our praise, and we confess to you today, Father, that we need you, and we trust you.
[time=1597] God, we ask you to break through our barriers of self-reliance.
[time=1603] God, may we today find it within our own spirit to confess that we need you, and that we're not sufficient within and of ourselves.
[time=1612] God, we thank you that you would love us through the Lord Jesus Christ and give to us so great a salvation.
[time=1618] Father, we thank you for the experience of having our sins forgiveness and new life implanted by the Spirit of God.
[time=1625] Father, we come today with a new heart refreshed to say we love you.
[time=1630] We thank you what you've done already in this hour through the ministry of music to lift our hearts to bring about the initiation of healing.
[time=1639] God, we pray today you would heal the broken hearts of people who need to have the joy of their salvation restored.
[time=1646] May believers find today a God's forgiveness is available to them.
[time=1652] God, we pray for the hearts of those who've never experienced your salvation.
[time=1657] That they in this hour might open up their heart to Christ.
[time=1661] We pray for those who've assembled this place and the others who would watch by way of television.
[time=1666] Oh, God, today we ask you to speak to each heart.
[time=1670] Father, I know in my own self I'm inadequate to even declare your praises, but God, your word promises us that you speak to the hearts of men by your spirit and we invite you to do that today.
[time=1681] Father, today we pray that you would give strength to the feeble.
[time=1686] Those whose bodies are failing, oh, God, today may they find that their strength is not in their body, but it's in you.
[time=1694] Father, we thank you for those who've had the courage to face cancer week by week.
[time=1700] God, we pray for them, particularly for Mary that you would strengthen her today.
[time=1706] Father, we pray for Harold Robinson that as he recovers from surgery you'd give strength to his body.
[time=1712] We pray for those who've lost loved ones in recent weeks for the Weattrix and the Howard family.
[time=1719] God, we pray that you would strengthen them.
[time=1722] Father, today we would ask you to bring about healing into each life that's been broken.
[time=1728] God, you know the needs of people that we've never seen who are crying out for you and we ask you to hear their prayer.
[time=1736] God, today through your word, we ask you to minister to each heart.
[time=1740] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1745] Five young missionaries left this country and headed for the land of Ecuador.
[time=1751] They're with the goal of penetrating the deepest jungle of that land.
[time=1757] To reach a tribe that had never been reached with the Gospel of Christ.
[time=1762] To reach a fierce warlike tribe.
[time=1766] A tribe called the Aca Indians.
[time=1769] Those five missionaries had a rather well planned and developed strategy as to how they were going to reach the Acas.
[time=1777] They began by flying over the Acas many, many times in the airplane and dropping out of the airplane a number of presents to the people.
[time=1788] Clothing, trinkets of interest to them and trying to befriend them before they ever brought themselves in.
[time=1796] Along with the gifts that they would shower out of the airplane they would also drop pictures of the pilots and the crew.
[time=1803] So that when the five missionaries did come in person they would recognize them by the pictures as the people who had befriended them from an airplane.
[time=1812] And they drew on the pictures of the four men and the fifth one being the pilot.
[time=1818] A little airplane on the sleeve of their shirt so that they would put together the faces when they saw them with the airplane.
[time=1825] They would know that these were friends that had come "civilized white men" had met the Acas many times but not as missionaries.
[time=1835] But they'd come to take the rubber plants from their land and to rob the land of its resources.
[time=1842] And there they would often enslave and abuse the Acas and they'd learn to hate the strangers.
[time=1847] And so these five missionaries endeavored to penetrate with love as they reached them in person there was first receptivity but then massacre.
[time=1860] Nate St. Jim Elliot, Peter Fleming, Euderian, all of them were slaughtered. Their bodies were found floating in the river.
[time=1871] When news reached their widows and their families you would expect great hatred.
[time=1877] In fact you found a group of ladies who would pray for forgiveness for the Aussie Indians who would slay their husband.
[time=1886] Rachel St. the sister of Nate St. one of the missionaries when she heard the news made a vow of commitment to the Lord that if he would allow her she would go to the Acas and tell him of God's forgiveness.
[time=1901] How do we deal with those who have struck us? How do we deal with our enemies?
[time=1909] Matthew chapter 5 verses 43 through 48. Jesus speaks about dealing with our enemies.
[time=1918] Matthew 5 verse 43. You have heard that it have been said, "Thou shall love thy neighbor and thou shall hate thine enemy."
[time=1930] But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you.
[time=1946] That ye may be the sons of your father who is in heaven. For he may give his son to rise on evil and good men and send a thrain on the just and the unjust.
[time=1961] For if ye love them who love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the tax collectors, the same?
[time=1972] And if you greet your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the heathen so?
[time=1985] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect.
[time=1993] Well, this concludes one of the sections of the Sermon on the Mount, a section that began with Jesus' rather bold and intimidating statement in Matthew 5, 20 when he said, "Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of these extremely religious people, you will no way see the kingdom of heaven."
[time=2018] That was awe-striking because the society to which Jesus first addressed that statement knew of no one whose righteousness came anywhere close to these scribes.
[time=2031] These Pharisees were meticulous in their obedience to the law, and in their mind comes the resounding question, "How good does an individual have to be in order to go to heaven?"
[time=2044] And the next verses that follow Jesus goes on to explain how good a person must be.
[time=2050] He first addressed the issue of murder, and he said, "It's not enough that you don't commit murder. You also must not hate anyone."
[time=2059] That's how good you must be, free from hate. Then he spoke to the issue of adultery or sexual impurity. He said, "It's not enough that you keep your body sexually pure. You've got to keep your mind sexually pure. You can never lust."
[time=2076] Then he spoke about oaths. He said, "It's not enough that when you sign your name to the contract you do it, you must always be truthful. Every time you say yes, you've got to mean yes, and every time you say no, it better mean no, full, complete, transparent, open, honest integrity."
[time=2095] Then he took to the issue of justice. "What do you do when you're hurt, you're sued, someone's striking out at you?"
[time=2104] He said, "Even when it's justified, you don't resist evil men, but you pay evil with kindness."
[time=2113] And now in the section that we've just looked at today, Jesus teaches on how do we deal with our enemies.
[time=2121] As he is always done, he uses the standard morality of the day and introduces it with the phrase, "You have heard it said."
[time=2130] What he is about to declare is not what the Old Testament declared, but what the rabbis taught out of the Old Testament, something different than what God directly said.
[time=2140] The rabbinical teaching of the day declared, "You should love your neighbor, but hate your enemy."
[time=2149] Is that what God said? No. In Leviticus, it tells the nation of Israel that they are to love their neighbor, meaning their fellow Israelites, and there were rather direct laws applying to how you treat your brother.
[time=2163] But the Bible never said, "You're to hate your enemies." But Israel practiced by God's plan what we would call ethnic separation, meaning they stayed unique as an ethnic group.
[time=2175] Jews were not to marry non-Jews, they were to remain pure religiously and ethnically.
[time=2182] So, there came a false teaching out of that statement of ethnic separation that I've got to love you because you're a fellow Israelite, but I can hate you if you're a mobite, or I can hate you if you're an Assyrian, or I can hate you if you're a Phoenician, or a Philistine, or a Canaanite, or a Pezzarite, or you're just some type ofite that's good enough, I can hate you.
[time=2203] That's not what God would say. And so, Jesus again breaks that tradition with the phrase, "But I say unto you."
[time=2214] Each of the six times he said this, he did two things. One, he took the attention and focused it not on the outward acts, but on the inward heart attitude.
[time=2226] He struck at the very core of our behavior, without our actions but our attitudes. And secondly, he elevated the standard above which the people were operating.
[time=2237] Jesus began by addressing, "How do you deal with your enemies? How do you deal with that person who has made their life mission to frustrate you?"
[time=2247] Joyce Landorf, in a book of the same title, speaks about your irregular person. That person who has found their calling to be to point out your every imperfection, to make sure that every one of your faults is focused on, to make it known to everyone of your inadequacies.
[time=2266] I don't know that each of us has an irregular person. There's more likely that each of us has several irregular people. How do you deal with that person who has just made their life a frustration in yours?
[time=2279] How do you deal with that businessman, who in very technical, legal language ripped you off?
[time=2287] And for the last 15 years, you've lived under the disadvantage of what he's done to you.
[time=2294] How do you deal with your enemies? Jesus' statement, "But I say unto you, love your enemies."
[time=2306] Many of you have been around churches long enough that you've heard great messages on the various types of love that the Greek New Testament employs.
[time=2315] This will not be one of those, but very briefly, we want to talk about the word love and what it means, because it is a unique word.
[time=2323] The Bible and the New Testament was written in what is called Koine Greek. It's different than classical Greek that Homer in 800 B.C. or Plato in 400 B.C. would have written in.
[time=2334] It was somewhat of a common Greek. It was a Greek language that Alexander took, and he spread throughout the known Mediterranean world as far east as India.
[time=2344] As far west as Spain. It was a language that helped one culture relate to another culture, one nation to communicate.
[time=2352] It became the trade language of the ancient world. In that language, there are a multitude of nouns and verbs that are used for love, but there are four chief ones that are used.
[time=2366] One is Eros. It means a physical love, a sensual love from which we get the English word erotic, enough said.
[time=2375] Second type of love was the word Storgae. Storgae actually described a family unit and the love that abides within a family. It described relationship.
[time=2386] There's a third word, Fala'o, from which we get the word Philadelphia, which simply means love of the brethren. Fala'o is a responsive type love.
[time=2396] Fala'o says, "I love you because you're lovable or I love you because you've treated me with love."
[time=2406] It's a responsive type love. It's a love that's reciprocal. It's a love that is very conditional and says, "I love you if."
[time=2415] And you fulfill my expectations. It's a love that describes two people who are living as equals and in that relationship there is love.
[time=2425] There's a fourth word, the word agape, agapato. That word is the word that is employed here. Some have mistakenly said, "This is a word that only describes God's love." That's not true.
[time=2438] The Koine Greek was around hundreds of years before the Greek New Testament. It was described by many, many Greeks to describe their relationships.
[time=2447] Perhaps the best translation is found in the King James Bible where it describes this type of love as charity.
[time=2454] Now, charity carries today somewhat of an undesirable connotation. It's really a good word. Charity is simply a love that is given to a person who doesn't necessarily deserve that love.
[time=2467] To a person who's never reciprocated that love. Give you an illustration.
[time=2472] If I shovel your sidewalk and you say, "Well, that was nice." And the next time it snows, you shovel my sidewalk. We may develop a relationship with exchange. That's for love.
[time=2486] If, however, you, not even knowing me, never having received anything from me, for some reason decide to show me some type of graciousness or courtesy or benevolence, and I have no ability to respond to that, and you know that you're not going to get anything back, that's agape.
[time=2509] That is a love that is charitable, that has no response intended. None has been initiated.
[time=2518] In Romans the 5th chapter, the Bible says that God loved us with this agape love.
[time=2526] And God loved us when we were described in Romans 5 and 3 ways. Way number 1, the Bible says that we were ungodly.
[time=2535] Way number 2, it says that God loved us while we were yet sinners, and Christ died for us.
[time=2543] And way number 3 is that God loved us while we were His enemies.
[time=2550] We did nothing to earn it. We did nothing to deserve it. There was no response. God simply loved us.
[time=2556] Here Jesus says, "If you want to receive entrance into the kingdom of heaven, you must love your enemies."
[time=2565] Now, one quick point. You can love someone that you don't like. That doesn't mean you can harbor ill feelings to them.
[time=2573] It's just you may not like the way they behave socially. You may not like the way they behave morally.
[time=2581] They may be a rather immoral person. They may be so immoral. They're immoral. They have no morals.
[time=2588] We're still to love them. That doesn't mean that we like what they do.
[time=2592] If someone is sexually promiscuous, that doesn't mean that I like sexual promiscuity.
[time=2598] Someone may be full of hatred and bitterness. That doesn't mean that we like the hatred and bitterness.
[time=2603] Someone may even be a murderer. That doesn't mean that we like murder.
[time=2608] But we still love the person, just like God loved us when we're everything that was undesirable.
[time=2617] Now, Jesus goes on to make three statements that describe the love that He was making reference to.
[time=2626] Love has always been a cheap word.
[time=2630] You ever notice that we use the same word to describe our relationship with our wife as we use to describe our attitude towards ice cream?
[time=2637] We love them both. Ice cream is leading today, but other than that, things are really going well.
[time=2642] It's a cheap word. It's used to describe a relationship between people who have lived together as husband and wife and partners for 50 years.
[time=2650] They've walked through the valleys. They've climbed the mountains together. They've had broken hearts together.
[time=2655] They've been healed together, and we call that love, and we also call a cheap act that can be performed by two animals as making love.
[time=2662] What did Jesus mean? When He said, "Love your enemies." He gave some definition. He made three statements.
[time=2669] Statement number one is this.
[time=2672] He said, "Bless them that curse you." I'd like to paraphrase it this way.
[time=2680] Wish God's best on those who wish you hell's worst.
[time=2688] We receive some type of curse, and we don't use that word today, but somebody just really lets us have it with both barrels and tells us where to go.
[time=2699] I don't mean the grocery store. They just really let you have it.
[time=2704] What they're saying is, "I am so angry with you. You have hurt me, and I'm striking out of you verbally."
[time=2710] What they were hell is, "I hope you get a lot of it, buddy, soon."
[time=2717] To that person, Jesus says, "We are to wish them God's blessing." The word that says, "Bless them" means to pray for them that God's blessings will pour out on them.
[time=2729] It may be a businessman who's ripped you off. Pray that his business will go well.
[time=2735] It may be a person who is bitter and striking out. Pray that God will show them love.
[time=2741] Pray for God's richest blessing upon their life, even though they've wished us hell's worst.
[time=2748] Jesus' second statement, "Do good to them that hate you."
[time=2758] Our show kindness to those who hate you.
[time=2764] Think of two illustrations that come to mind immediately in fulfillment of this attitude.
[time=2771] The first is David. You remember David went out and he slew the giant Goliath and immediately became a hero in the nation of Israel.
[time=2780] And then, in their day as it is today, they like to make songs about their heroes.
[time=2785] Apparently, one of the tunes that was on the top 40 went something like this.
[time=2789] Saul has slain his thousands, and that pleased the king's ear very much.
[time=2795] But after David had slain the giant Goliath, a new tune appeared on the charts.
[time=2803] And it said Saul has slain his thousands, but David is ten thousands.
[time=2807] It was a very popular song. Much to the king's frustration, everyone was singing it.
[time=2814] The king became rather angry, jealous.
[time=2819] So he struck out at David. He tried to kill him. He tried to kill him repeatedly.
[time=2825] The point where David had to flee to the wilderness and hide in caves and live like an animal.
[time=2831] On a given night, Saul was encamped outside the cave in which David did hide.
[time=2837] With a great army, a search party, and at night they went to sleep, David trapped in the cave.
[time=2846] At nighttime, David snuck out of the cave through the irresponsible guards and made his way right up to the sleeping body of Saul.
[time=2854] He picked up the king's spear. No doubt with an eye of running the king's own spear right through him and ending that battle.
[time=2863] It would have been justified. The king had tried to kill him. It was self-defense.
[time=2868] If David didn't strike today, Saul'd strike tomorrow.
[time=2872] An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Roodhager died. Get him before they get you.
[time=2879] Instead, David picked up some of the articles that belonged to the king that were close to his body.
[time=2884] Snuck back to the cave and its son up.
[time=2887] He jumped up and he yelled out, awakening the army in King Saul.
[time=2892] And said, "Saul, I was in your camp last night." And he showed the articles as evidence that he was there.
[time=2899] He said, "I could have killed you, but I will not raise my hand against the lords in knowing it." And he showed kindness to the one that hated him.
[time=2908] I think of Elisha, one of the most fantastic stories of God's intervention in history.
[time=2914] The king of Syria, or Aram, as it may be better to be called technically, was marching into Israel, trying to find the king of Israel to attack him.
[time=2922] God kept giving prophetic revelation to the mind of Elisha.
[time=2926] And so every time the king of Iran would come, Elisha would get this revelation, tell the king of Israel who'd move.
[time=2932] The king of Iran became invignant and frustrated and was sure somebody in his own camp was betraying him.
[time=2938] His soldier said, "It's none of us, but we got it figured out. There's this prophet down in Dotham."
[time=2944] And God's telling him, he's tipping him off.
[time=2948] So the king of Iran assembles his army and the whole army marches towards Dotham to take one man, Elisha.
[time=2955] And Elisha's servants come running saying, "Oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do?" And Elisha quotes, has a kind to do and says, "Swet thou not the small stuff." And just says, "There won't be any problem. There's no has a kind in the Bible for some of you who may not have known that."
[time=2969] And Elisha marches out and God blinds the eyes of all of the people of Iran who are marching in there.
[time=2979] And Elisha says, "Oh, the man you're looking for is in a different city. Here I'll take you there." And Elisha marches them into a fortified city of Samaria and the king of Israel and all the army are surrounding them
[time=2991] with their arrows drawn, their spirits pointed, ready for Elisha to say, "Now!"
[time=2997] And God opens the eyes of the people of Syria and they, "Oh, this is it."
[time=3005] And the king says, "Elisha, shall we zap them now? Just give us the word." And Elisha says, "No, give them food, bread and water, a place to lodge and send them home."
[time=3019] These were the people that were trying to kill Elisha. These were the people that were trying to run over Israel.
[time=3024] And he says, "Send them home with bread and water. Do good to those who hate you."
[time=3032] It's interesting in 2 Kings 6 and the end of the story says, "And from that day forth, the people of Iran stopped raiding the land of Israel."
[time=3043] You know why that is? It's because Proverbs 16 says this, "That when a man's ways please the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him."
[time=3057] Do good. Show kindness to those who hate you. That's what it means to love our enemies.
[time=3065] Third statement Jesus made was this. He said, "Pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you."
[time=3075] The word pray is rather a general word for prayer. It's a generic word, if you will.
[time=3080] It's not a unique word that talks about Thanksgiving or our intercession or praise.
[time=3085] It's just a general word that means to pray. But I think the Spirit he has here is to pray for their forgiveness.
[time=3091] For those people who despitefully use you and who persecute you.
[time=3096] The nature of these two verbs despitefully use and persecute is that these are present participles, which is a whole lot of technical language to make one point.
[time=3106] These verbs are a form that says they continually, they habitually.
[time=3112] This isn't talking about a person who one time harasses you or one time hurts you.
[time=3117] This is talking about the individual who's made it their mission to harass you.
[time=3121] The person who consistently is after you. The word persecute actually means to chase, to hound, to follow after.
[time=3129] He said those individuals who harass us continually, who hate us and who harm us, it says where to pray for.
[time=3139] Stephen looked into the face of his stoners. He said, "God, forgive them."
[time=3149] Modeling the Lord Jesus Christ, who after 24 hours of physical abuse, harm, hurt and harassment, nailed to a cross would hang there and say, "Father, forgive them."
[time=3168] They know not what they do.
[time=3172] Jesus said, "If you would want to go into the kingdom of heaven, you've got to love your enemies in these three ways.
[time=3179] Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you."
[time=3187] Now he gives his argumentation as to the result of what he's talking about.
[time=3194] Verse 45, "If you do this, the result is that ye may be the sons of your father who is in heaven."
[time=3202] Now what he means by that expression to become a child of God or a son of God doesn't mean that there's a metaphysical change that takes place.
[time=3209] It's simply representing when you say someone is the son of something that they possess the same character or the same quality.
[time=3217] For example, James and John were called the sons of boraginies or the sons of thunder.
[time=3223] By sons of thunder that meant that these young boys possessed somewhat of a thunderous personality.
[time=3230] They were boisterous. They were loud. They were dominant. They were eager.
[time=3235] When we call someone to chip off the old block, we're saying, "You're just like your dad." My father isn't an exceptional, exceptional golfer.
[time=3244] We went golfing the day after Thanksgiving. I didn't have my clubs or any equipment, so I used his.
[time=3250] He had a sleeve of brand new balls he flipped to me.
[time=3253] No exaggeration. All three of the brand new balls were gone by the second hole.
[time=3259] Two in the pond, one in the thick out of bounds. The gentleman who we were playing with looked at me and said,
[time=3266] "Well, you're not a chip off the old block, are you?" What he was saying is, "Your dad's a golfer, but no one's going to confuse you as a golfer."
[time=3277] Why? Because I didn't possess the quality of my father.
[time=3280] Jesus said, "If you possess the qualities of the father in heaven, then you're going to be called the sons of God.
[time=3286] But if you don't possess these qualities, you're not going to be called a chip off of God's block.
[time=3292] Only people are going to have another ones who are called the children of God." Now he gives somewhat of a reasoning. He says, "Basically, two points. Point number one is this.
[time=3306] God's love knows no discrimination." He said, "God causes the sun to rise on good people at the same time of day as he does bad people."
[time=3315] Do you ever listen to the weather report in the morning before sun up and hear the news person say, "Well, the sun up today for the good people is at 642, and for the bad people, God's going to zap you with one less hour of sunlight."
[time=3328] It comes up pretty much the same time for everybody.
[time=3332] And God causes his reign to fall in the field of the unjust, just like he does the just.
[time=3337] Two farmers lives next door to each other. When the rain clouds pass over, it's not like God said,
[time=3343] "I'm going to get these 40 acres." And then the cloud shuts off, drifts over the next 40 acres and starts again.
[time=3350] When you drive down the street and say, "Aha, we can tell who the unjust farmers are. Look at those brown spots." When God makes it rain, he makes it rain. God's love knows no discrimination.
[time=3361] And he's saying, "If we're the children of God, then our love knows no discrimination." See that person over there who's going to get an abortion? God loves her anyway.
[time=3369] See that young man over there who's fathered that child monosume responsibility? God still loves them.
[time=3375] See that person over there? That individual who has got a bitter spirit and their spirit of bitterness is like a spiritual cancer that's eating up their life. God still loves them.
[time=3385] See that person over there who's caused more grief to their parents than any other 10 children? God still loves them.
[time=3392] Our love is the love in spite of who people are, just like God loves us in spite of who we are.
[time=3400] God's love knows no discrimination. Jesus' second point of reasoning is this.
[time=3407] He says, "If you love those who love you, so what? Even the publicans do that." Meaning the tax collectors.
[time=3415] Love that is unique is love that is given when hatred is shallered. Jesus' basic point is this.
[time=3423] There's only two ways to heaven. One is to be absolutely morally perfect and this point is no one has made it.
[time=3429] Our two to receive Christ is Savior and to be cleansed morally. None of us are perfect, but all of us can be cleansed.
[time=3438] Have you been made clean? Have you received Christ? If not, I pray that you will.
