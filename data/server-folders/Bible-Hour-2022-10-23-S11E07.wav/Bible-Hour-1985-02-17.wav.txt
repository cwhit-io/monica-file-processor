[time=0] (bell ringing) Thank you for bringing us here in this place.
[time=31] - I pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=33] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=41] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=48] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God, with pastor Rick Hawks. Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.

[time=311] (music playing)
[time=543] We have heard the joyful sound, Jesus saves, Jesus saves. That's the faith in which we can put our trust. Jesus died on the cross, rose again for our personal salvation in Him.
[time=555] And to sing that familiar hymn, 380, we have heard the joyful sound, Jesus saves.
[time=562] (music playing)
[time=672] What a great admonition that Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth in the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me." Thank you for your good singing this morning and participation in the music. Let's listen now as Ron Hackett comes to minister to us in song entitled, "Why Have You Chosen Me?"
[time=690] (music playing)
[time=709] Why have you chosen me out of millions, your child to be, you know all the wrong that I've done?
[time=732] Oh, how could you pardon me, forgive my iniquity and save me, give Jesus yourself?
[time=755] What would help me be, what you want me to be?
[time=766] Your word I would strive to obey, my life I now give, by you I will live and walk by your side all alone.
[time=795] All the way.
[time=801] I am amazed to know that a God so great could love me so, he's willing and wanting to bless.
[time=824] His grace is so wonderful, his mercy so bountiful, I can't understand it, I confess.
[time=846] Oh Lord, help me be, what you want me to be.
[time=857] Your word I would strive to obey, my life I now give, by you.
[time=875] I will live and walk by your side all alone.
[time=892] My life I now give, by you I will live and walk by your side all alone.
[time=921] Again, we want to welcome you and thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=946] Good morning Pete, how are you?
[time=948] I'm just fine, thank you.
[time=949] Good, we need to be careful, not always saying good morning.
[time=952] I said that because many of our friends are watching at times other than Sunday morning even though it's morning to us.
[time=957] I would say that people better be wide awake by six o'clock in South Bend when they televised this program there.
[time=963] I hope so.
[time=964] There's such a joy for us to be able to come into your home or perhaps your hospital room or wherever you're at and share with you the commitment and the love that we have for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=975] It's our desire to make him known in this region of Indiana and to share Christ with each of you.
[time=982] One of the ways that we can do that is not only through this telecast but through a pamphlet that helps you to study the scriptures on your own.
[time=990] It's called Timeless Insight and I'd like to ask Pete to tell you about it.
[time=994] Rick, in particular today this is a timely message from Timeless Insights.
[time=999] It tells us to wait upon the Lord even though we have plans in these last few days of snow.
[time=1006] It's been difficult to get our plans going here at the church because just everything has kind of come to a standstill.
[time=1013] Sometimes that's God's plan too and in Timeless Insights you have the opportunity to read the scriptures every day,
[time=1020] to have someone who has studied the Word of God to make comment on that.
[time=1024] We'd like to encourage you to write for that pamphlet and you can write for Timeless Insights to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1036] As soon as you write we will send you Timeless Insights and you can begin reading in the book of Acts.
[time=1042] Pete, I'm somewhat of a systems person that if I don't have a list I forget what I'm supposed to buy when Kathy sends me to the grocery store and if I don't have a to-do list for each day I miss something.
[time=1053] And I need a system to help me study God's Word.
[time=1056] And that's what Timeless Insights is because it systematically takes you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1061] And I hope that you'll take the advice and the address that Pete gave you and write in and we'd be glad to send you this copy absolutely free.
[time=1070] Well today we have some special news to share with you that is a delight to all of us here but particularly to one family that works with the Bible Hour.
[time=1078] Glenn and Debbie Schick have been a part of the Bible Hour for longer than I have to be honest.
[time=1083] Glenn is the engineer who is the technical mind that keeps all the equipment going and actually is running the controls right now.
[time=1091] And his wife Debbie has been our assistant producer.
[time=1095] She writes the scripts and keeps all the times and keeps everything running smoothly in terms of queuing things.
[time=1101] Well they are the proud parents of a new baby boy Chad Allen is his name and Chad's not here today he's only a few days old.
[time=1109] He's at home with his mother but we wanted to announce and to share the good news with you.
[time=1114] And we are so thankful for God's blessing on the Schick family and on all of us here as we have the privilege of seeing this young child grow up.
[time=1121] That reminds us as parents of what a responsibility we have to raise our children in the way that will please him.
[time=1128] Pete I want to encourage our friends to write in.
[time=1131] It's been snowing outside.
[time=1133] Many people have been homebound, stuck in, frustrated, we call it going steer crazy.
[time=1139] And if you've got some time we would love to hear from you.
[time=1142] Write in and tell us how you're doing.
[time=1145] You're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1147] Where are you watching it from?
[time=1148] From a hospital?
[time=1149] From your home?
[time=1150] Have you been watching it long?
[time=1151] We just like to know more about you.
[time=1153] Our viewers that we share with each week.
[time=1155] Would you give them the address one more time?
[time=1157] Yes.
[time=1158] Obviously Rick we're encouraged when people write into us and especially in the South Bend area since that's a new area for us to be on television.
[time=1165] Please write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1173] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1180] Pete we're not only broadcasting here in Fort Wayne and in South Bend but a new Christian radio.
[time=1186] I said radio didn't I?
[time=1188] This is television.
[time=1189] A new Christian television station has begun in the city of Marion and the Bible Hour is being broadcast there also.
[time=1196] And so if you're a new viewer to us in Marion we'd love to hear from you as well.
[time=1201] Again thank you for joining us.
[time=1203] We trust that God will use this broadcast to strengthen your faith and encourage you spiritually.
[time=1209] But most of all if you don't know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior it's our most sincere desire and prayer that today you'll open up your heart and receive Him.
[time=1220] We invite you to stay with us as we go back to the live part of our morning worship service as Dennis Kirschner who so often ministers to us in music on the organ is going to be singing for us and then we'll look at what Jesus said about mastering our money.
[time=1239] I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus, how in here my found a friend so strong and true.
[time=1266] I would tell you how he changed my life completely.
[time=1274] He did something that no other friend could do.
[time=1284] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=1298] There's no other friend so come as he.
[time=1313] No one else could take the sin and darkness from me.
[time=1328] Oh how much he cared for me.
[time=1342] Every day he comes to me with new assurance.
[time=1349] More and more I understand his words of love but I'll never know just why he came to save me.
[time=1363] Till some day I see his blessed face above.
[time=1373] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=1387] There's no other friend so kind as he.
[time=1402] No one else could take the sin and darkness from me.
[time=1417] Oh how much he cared for me.
[time=1457] Thank you Dennis, oh how much he cares for me.
[time=1463] Our Father we thank you today that you care for us and that you are concerned about our concerns.
[time=1471] Father we thank you for your love that envelopes and surrounds us and holds us.
[time=1478] God today we would pray that that grip would be tight and secure, that your presence might hold and bind the heart of those today who bear great burdens.
[time=1493] We pray particularly for Ralph Cox and his father Judy Dabel and her family.
[time=1506] We pray today for Brady Gumpfer, Helen Weimer, Mary Lampman, Catherine Northrup, a whole multitude of people that battle cancer.
[time=1514] We pray for Dale Johnson and his mother.
[time=1517] God today the burdens of people are great but we trust in you that you're gracing your strength minister to each heart.
[time=1525] We ask you to encourage the beloved today that through their walk with you through their study of your word that there would come a subtle confidence in the midst of crises.
[time=1537] God today we come to you with our needs so long and our appreciation so short.
[time=1545] God we begin even today with needs and fail to say God we thank you for your goodness.
[time=1551] We thank you today for the peace that you've given.
[time=1555] We thank you today for the prosperity that we know.
[time=1558] We thank you for the cleansing that we experience in Christ.
[time=1562] We thank you for being made new in the attitude of restoration.
[time=1568] Yet today God we also are aware of the needs.
[time=1572] We pray for that one who is a single parent who wrestles alone.
[time=1577] God give them extra strength.
[time=1579] We pray that you'd be a father to the fatherless.
[time=1582] We pray that your spirit would nurture the child that has no mother.
[time=1588] God we pray that you bring healing into relationships between husband and wife, between parent and adolescent.
[time=1596] God we pray that you take hearts that are rebellious and turn them towards their fathers.
[time=1602] God we pray that you take the hearts of fathers that are selfish and consumed and blurred priorities and turn that heart towards children.
[time=1611] Father today we pray that your word would speak to us in these vital critical areas of our life.
[time=1617] We might have more insight from your word to direct our lives.
[time=1623] For it's in Jesus name that we pray, amen.
[time=1628] As a college student during the times of the Vietnam War, the campus was surrounded with signs of protest, calls for peace.
[time=1640] It was an election year, 1972.
[time=1643] The students were certain that peace would be the dominant issue.
[time=1648] In a political theory class a professor gave a whole new perspective.
[time=1655] He assured us that the war in Vietnam was a major issue and it was a major concern in the political arena.
[time=1661] But he chided us and scolded us to be so naive as to think that that would be the key issue in any election.
[time=1668] And corrected our thinking by declaring very vividly that every election in America has one issue as it's dominant theme and that is the issue of money.
[time=1679] Economic domestic development will always dictate the ballot box.
[time=1686] Other issues may be important, may be pressing, but nothing is more important and more pressing on the minds of America than the dollar.
[time=1698] Is it rising? Is the budget balanced? Do we have a trade deficit?
[time=1703] Is there going to be a surplus of grain will we sell to the Russians?
[time=1707] Economic development.
[time=1709] Money is not only the chief concern of our culture, but of every culture.
[time=1717] Open your Bibles with us to Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1724] Matthew chapter 6 verses 1 through 4 last week we studied what Jesus said about giving.
[time=1734] We're going to pass over a few verses and hold those in reserve to study in just a few weeks on prayer so that we can continue Jesus' theme about giving and look and see what did Jesus say about money.
[time=1748] Matthew chapter 6 verse 19, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust death corrupt and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust death corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal.
[time=1777] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye.
[time=1786] If therefore thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thy eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
[time=1800] If therefore the eye is evil, how great is thy darkness?
[time=1808] No man can serve two masters, for he will either hate the one and love the other are cling to one and despise the other.
[time=1819] You cannot serve God and Mammon." What did Jesus say about money?
[time=1827] That is a very important theme for us to talk about and we have a pivotal verse that we've ended with today. Jesus' statement, "No man can serve two masters."
[time=1838] We will either have as the master of our life God or Mammon. Perhaps the best way to translate that is money or materialism.
[time=1850] Jesus is here speaking about how we can master money rather than money master us. Money can have a strange power over us, can it?
[time=1860] It can occupy us, control us, dictate to us. It can possess us rather than us possessing it.
[time=1866] Edmund Burke, the English writer of a few generations ago, put it this way. If we command our wealth, then we shall be both rich and free.
[time=1878] But if our wealth commands us, then we will be poor indeed. Who possesses whom?
[time=1888] Do we possess our money or does our money possess us?
[time=1895] We often look at our life and say, "Oh, if I just had." You can fill in the blank. It will change daily. It will be replaced by something else once you get if you just had. There will always be one more.
[time=1912] How much is enough? Quite easily. I can tell you exactly how much is enough for me because it's the same that's enough for you, just a little bit more.
[time=1923] That's all we need, just a little bit more.
[time=1928] A man by the name of Pindar, Greek, said this centuries ago, gold, a son of Zeus, neither moth nor rest, death devour, but the mind of man, it devours.
[time=1949] It's very easy for our mind to become preoccupied to the point of being imprisoned by our preoccupation with money and all that it can bring. Power, possessions, and prestige.
[time=1964] Jesus is now speaking about how we can master money. There's been a subtle implication from every generation that if we just had a little bit more money, we could solve every problem.
[time=1977] Solomon said sarcastically, "Wine is for making merry, and money is the answer for everything." Sounds like a house appropriations committee, doesn't it?
[time=1989] If we just had a little bit more money for this program, then everything would be wonderful, just a little bit more.
[time=1997] That's all we need, just a little bit more.
[time=2003] Jesus here speaks, in the verses that we've read, some introductory principles about how we can master our money rather than the money mastering us.
[time=2012] I need to study it intently. I live on the verge of shackles daily. And it's not because I don't get paid well. I get paid very generously.
[time=2023] But I always spend somewhere between 100 and 105 percent of what I make. It just floats, always upward.
[time=2033] Jesus' first principle is this. If we are ever going to master our money, it's going to begin by setting the ultimate priorities in our life.
[time=2043] Now what did he mean by that? Jesus said, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures in heaven." I said that wrong, didn't I? You didn't even catch that.
[time=2054] We're just standing there. That's right. That's what Jesus said. "Lay not up for yourselves treasures in microphones. They don't always work."
[time=2067] I thought I had a cold and I'd have difficulty, but this will just make it challenging.
[time=2072] I'm not worried about those in the balcony. I'm worried about those in their homes who are watching by way of television.
[time=2077] I'm not sure whether their microphones work. What did Jesus say?
[time=2082] He said, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, but on the contrast lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."
[time=2090] He's making a distinction between values and priorities there.
[time=2095] A man by the name of John R.W. Stott, a great English preacher, has taken the time to give us some insight as to what Jesus was not saying here.
[time=2106] Unless you think we're all going to move into the farm country and live in a great big barn and eat the grain and the silo, let's give some perspective.
[time=2116] First of all, Jesus was not saying here that personal possessions are wrong.
[time=2122] As a matter of fact, Deuteronomy 8, 18 says, "It is the Lord who giveth the strength to gain possessions."
[time=2131] James says, "Every good and perfect gift comes down from the Father above." Everything that we have, everything that we possess, comes from God.
[time=2142] Jesus here isn't saying, "Don't have anything. Liquidate every asset. Get rid of every possession. Sell your property."
[time=2150] That wasn't the point at all.
[time=2153] Nor was Jesus saying secondly that it's wrong to enjoy the possessions that we have.
[time=2159] If you ever notice the false pietism that we often have as Christians, that we kind of play down our possessions.
[time=2168] Like, well, yeah, we have it, but it's all right to enjoy it.
[time=2174] It's all right to say that we enjoy. God has given us what He has given us for us to enjoy.
[time=2180] 1 Timothy, chapter 6, verse 18 says, "God has given us all things to what to enjoy."
[time=2187] Do you have a car? Enjoy it. Do you have a television set? Enjoy it. Do you have a house? Enjoy it.
[time=2194] There isn't anything that we have to impose upon ourselves, a guilt trip that we have something, and therefore not enjoy the use of it because it's materialistic.
[time=2205] Now, whatever God's given us, He's given it to us to be enjoyed freely.
[time=2210] Thirdly, Jesus was not saying when He made the statement, "Do not lay up treasures on earth."
[time=2216] He was not saying, "Do not save." Don't have a checking account. Don't make investments.
[time=2221] Don't plan for the future.
[time=2225] If you'll remember the book of Proverbs talks about the ant, and we are commended to look to the ant, why? Because the ant saves and stores up and plans and provides for the future.
[time=2241] As a matter of fact, this is such a critical area that Paul wrote to Timothy and said, "Timothy, if a man does not financially provide for his family," and he didn't just mean the nuclear family,
[time=2252] he had there in mind the extended family of parents and grandparents.
[time=2256] He said, "If a man doesn't provide for his family, he is worse than an infidel, worse than an unbeliever."
[time=2263] Look to the ant.
[time=2266] Oh, sluggered.
[time=2268] We're to be working. We're to be industrious. We are to be saving. We are to be preparing for the future.
[time=2276] What did Jesus then mean?
[time=2279] What's rather interesting that the word lay up is the word treasure, and exactly what Jesus said is this, don't treasure for yourself treasures.
[time=2287] Well, what's the problem? I think there are three things that are a problem.
[time=2293] First of all, it's that little reflexive pronoun yourself.
[time=2299] Jesus was saying our reference point is ourself.
[time=2303] Don't treasure things, don't hoard things, don't collect things, don't amask things for the purpose of self.
[time=2312] This is mine. This belongs to me.
[time=2318] Someone has called the first person singular the aggressive pronoun, me, mine, I, self.
[time=2330] That is primarily the problem.
[time=2334] It is a reference that what I have, what I possess, it belongs to me.
[time=2339] The Bible makes it very clear nothing belongs to us, nothing.
[time=2344] The Bible says the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=2349] By that King James expression, the fullness thereof, it means everything.
[time=2353] It means my house, it means my watch, it means my car, it means my children.
[time=2359] The Bible says they're an heritage of the Lord. God gave them to me.
[time=2363] They belong to Him. It means my own life.
[time=2368] God said all souls are mine. Paul said, you're not your own.
[time=2373] You've been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your bodies.
[time=2376] We don't own anything, including ourselves.
[time=2380] Howard Hendricks put it this way. When was the last time you saw a hearse pulling a U-Haul?
[time=2386] It doesn't happen.
[time=2389] Job said naked, our empty came-eye from my mother's womb, and naked charring returned.
[time=2398] We end our life with nothing, we exit it with nothing.
[time=2402] And everything that we handle in the meantime literally belongs to God and not to self.
[time=2408] But there's a second problem that Jesus was warning about when he said, do not treasure up treasures on earth.
[time=2415] That problem was this, that what we're treasuring is of temporary value at best.
[time=2421] In economic language, it's a non-secured deposit.
[time=2425] I mean, who would put their money in a savings account if it didn't say FDIC, insured up to $100,000?
[time=2433] I mean, we talk about security and secured investments.
[time=2437] Jesus is saying your investments aren't secure.
[time=2440] He describes the insecurity in three phrases.
[time=2443] He said, some of your investments, some of your securities can be moth eaten.
[time=2448] He's primarily referring to clothing.
[time=2452] In the ancient world, a man's prestige, his dignity, his significance, his status was worn.
[time=2460] If you had money, what good was it if you couldn't flaunt it?
[time=2464] So you wore just the right color of clothing.
[time=2467] Purple dye was expensive, so if you had something in purple, wow, you were something special.
[time=2474] You really had it.
[time=2476] You got the edge on the rest of it.
[time=2479] It was kind of like wearing your designer clothes with the label out.
[time=2483] You know, it's one thing to pay $40 for a pair of jeans.
[time=2486] It's another thing to pay $40 and have no one know it.
[time=2490] I mean, they got to know it.
[time=2492] What's the use of paying for it if no one knows it?
[time=2497] You were saying, you know all that significance, all that prestige, all that cloud, all that pump.
[time=2505] He said, you ever see it when a moth gets ahold of it?
[time=2508] It's really great, isn't it?
[time=2511] Moths are intelligent.
[time=2513] You know that?
[time=2515] There are claws that we had four sweaters.
[time=2518] Two polyester, one 100% wool.
[time=2521] Guess which one the moth ate.
[time=2523] Then go for polyester.
[time=2527] It's useless.
[time=2529] A beautiful sweater is useless.
[time=2534] Then he said, or rust.
[time=2536] That word actually doesn't limit itself to corrosion as much as deterioration,
[time=2542] like a precious metal that deteriorates.
[time=2546] That it may rust, it may tarnish, it may corrode, but it can also refer to grain that gets moldy or eaten up by decay.
[time=2556] Remember the man who kept his prestige in his barns in Luke chapter 12?
[time=2561] He said, I've got much grain.
[time=2563] Therefore, I will tear down my barns and I will build bigger barns that I may store my grain.
[time=2572] And it rots.
[time=2574] Jesus is saying it's so temporary.
[time=2576] It's a poor investment.
[time=2580] And the third statement.
[time=2582] He said, aren't things that thieves do break through and steal?
[time=2588] I find it just somewhat of an interesting word.
[time=2591] The word steal is a compound of two words, wall and digger.
[time=2596] Because in the ancient world, many, many of the houses were made out of mud.
[time=2600] You know, mud, baked bricks.
[time=2602] And thieves literally dug through the walls.
[time=2604] So if you thought someone was real scoundered, you'd say, you know, good dirty mud digger, that meant you thought they were a thief because they dig through the wall and they would steal.
[time=2613] Jesus said, it's not only wrong to lay up treasures with reference to self, but it's a poor investment.
[time=2619] It's insecure.
[time=2620] It's temporary.
[time=2623] And then finally, Jesus said, the values are wrong,
[time=2629] because if you treasure these, your heart will follow.
[time=2634] Verse 21 is a strange verse.
[time=2639] It says, where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=2646] I always thought it was where your heart is, there your treasure will go.
[time=2650] Jesus said, just the opposite.
[time=2653] He's warning us that our values must be correct, because once we place a treasure on something,
[time=2660] our heart is going to follow.
[time=2663] Let me go to the street.
[time=2665] Do you ever have a new car?
[time=2667] Remember when you got that new car?
[time=2671] Past rule number one, no kids eating in the car.
[time=2675] There shall be no gum, no pop, no french fries, no food, no candy in the car, that's it.
[time=2681] It got washed because it got dirty when you drove it home from the car wash.
[time=2688] You waxed it regularly and consistently, you vacuumed the clean carpet.
[time=2693] Why?
[time=2694] Because you had an investment there.
[time=2695] You paid a lot of money, and if you didn't, the bank did.
[time=2699] It was a treasure.
[time=2701] And as soon as you possessed that treasure, suddenly your heart was following that treasure.
[time=2707] That's true of so many of our possessions, that they began to call us.
[time=2713] They began to woo us like the sirens of Homer's Odysseus.
[time=2717] And they began to speak to us, and they control us.
[time=2721] Jesus said, if we're ever going to master our money, then we're going to have to get in control of the critical area of values in our life.
[time=2730] And if we're placing all of our values on collecting, accumulating, storing possessions,
[time=2740] our possessions are soon going to master us.
[time=2743] He said, on the other hand, store up treasure in heaven.
[time=2747] Now, let me tell you that there's a lot of confusion in this area.
[time=2752] There are those that teach that God's got this great big bank in the sky, and he's got an account with your name on it.
[time=2760] And if you help out in evangelism, God puts a little money in your account.
[time=2766] You help out in the choir, God puts a little money in your account.
[time=2769] You help out in children's Sunday school, God puts a little money in your account and a little extra for combat pay.
[time=2774] You know, you put a little money in the church offering, God puts a lot of money in your heavenly offering.
[time=2779] I don't think that's biblical.
[time=2782] If it is, I haven't seen it.
[time=2786] The Bible only teaches two types of rewards in heaven.
[time=2790] The first is the reward that is given freely by faith in Christ.
[time=2793] That's the reward of eternal life, of forgiveness.
[time=2796] And that comes by believing on Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=2799] You can possess that right now.
[time=2801] Many of you do.
[time=2803] You simply have to believe in Christ and ask Him to come in your heart and forgive your sins.
[time=2811] There's only one other reward the Bible speaks of and that's the reward of crowns.
[time=2816] That in heaven, God is going to give crowns as a reward.
[time=2819] There are several types of crowns.
[time=2821] Crowns, for example, like the crown of life.
[time=2823] That's given to the individual who endures persecution faithfully.
[time=2828] There'll be a crown given to those who have been faithful and winning others to Christ.
[time=2832] But don't get too excited about the crowns.
[time=2835] Don't worry about getting a fitting because you're never going to wear it.
[time=2839] The glorious thing about the crown is that we're going to cast them back at the Lord's feet and say worthy is the lamb.
[time=2846] He alone is worthy of glory and praise and riches and wisdom and honor.
[time=2854] Then what is the treasure in heaven?
[time=2857] I think Paul gave us a clue when he wrote to Timothy about this critical area of money
[time=2863] and talked about contentment and the need to always have more.
[time=2866] Paul said, "Timothy, godliness with contentment is great game."
[time=2876] When we look at the agenda for our life, those ought to be the dominant concerns.
[time=2883] Not how can I buy this, how can I possess that, how can I move on up, it ought to be.
[time=2890] How can I become more godly?
[time=2893] How can I become more patient?
[time=2897] How can I be more loving and gracious to people who disagree with me because it's obvious
[time=2903] that they're wrong or else they would agree with me?
[time=2908] How can I get a better perspective so that I'm looking at life through the eyes of Christ?
[time=2914] That ought to be our agenda.
[time=2917] Our goal is ought to be this is what God treasures in heaven, love, joy, peace, patience,
[time=2924] long-suffering, gentleness, kindness, goodness, fruit of the Spirit out of Galatians 5.
[time=2932] If we're ever going to master our money, it's going to begin by establishing our ultimate priorities and shifting them from materialism to God's values.
[time=2942] Second principle that Jesus gave is this very quickly.
[time=2947] That if we're ever going to control our appetite, we're going to have to control our eyes.
[time=2953] In these verses 22 and 23, he says, "The eye is the light of the body." In other words, it's the eye that is the window to the soul.
[time=2963] Whatever our eye sees, it is only a matter of time before our appetite wants.
[time=2971] One of the most expensive things that we can do is to go window shopping.
[time=2976] Very seldom does it end there.
[time=2980] Why? Because we see something and when we see it, we begin to want it.
[time=2986] What type of eyes do we have?
[time=2989] Do we have eyes that are selfish, consuming?
[time=2993] Do we have eyes that are generous and giving?
[time=2997] Amy Grant sings a song that says "Her Father's Eyes." It's a song that speaks about she wants people to when they see her say, "She has eyes like God," meaning she sees life the way God sees it with those values and those perspectives.
[time=3012] Jesus' contrast, treasures on earth with treasures in heaven, now He contrasts your eyes.
[time=3018] My eyes is either being single or evil.
[time=3021] That word "single" was tough for me to handle, so I did some digging this week.
[time=3026] What do you mean by that?
[time=3028] That word in one form occurs in the scriptures eleven times.
[time=3032] Four times it is translated "single" as it is here.
[time=3036] Three times it's translated "simple." And four other times it is translated "liberally or generously."
[time=3047] I start thinking, "What's the connection between something that is single, simple, and something that is generous?"
[time=3055] A man by the name of Kittle, who has written a long, lengthy exposition of Greek words in the New Testament,
[time=3063] makes this insight.
[time=3066] The idea here is of a generous, kind eye, an attitude that sees and is ready to give,
[time=3074] compared to an evil eye that is selfish and grudging.
[time=3079] Solomon said in Proverbs 23, "Do not eat bread of him that hath an evil eye."
[time=3085] What Solomon said is, "Don't go to dinner. Don't sit down at someone's table if they have an evil eye, meaning a greedy, grudging eye."
[time=3095] Don't go to someone's house and eat with them if they're begrudging you seconds.
[time=3103] If they're concerned about how much you're going to eat.
[time=3107] If a person is in generous and open and free to share, then they have an eye that is evil.
[time=3116] But if our eye is single or generous, simple, and it's forthright giving,
[time=3122] then it's an eye that is generous, single, pleasing unto God.
[time=3128] And what Jesus is saying here is our eyes are the gateway to the inner person.
[time=3134] And in the inner person are all the qualities developed.
[time=3139] If we fix our eye on things, our appetite for things will increase and increase and increase.
[time=3146] We've got to singly set it on being generous and giving and supporting.
[time=3152] That word single occurs in James chapter 1 verse 5 where the Bible says, "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all liberally, generously.
[time=3163] It's used in 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 2 where it says that the people of Macedonia
[time=3169] gave liberally to the churches of Jerusalem.
[time=3173] It's used in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 where it says, "God has caused his bountiful blessing to come on us."
[time=3182] We're going to control our money. We're going to have to control our appetites.
[time=3189] Third principle is this.
[time=3193] Jesus said, "We're going to serve someone and we best surrender to the right master."
[time=3201] Verse 24 says this, "No man can serve two masters.
[time=3207] He will either love this one and hate that one or he's going to cling to this one and despise that one."
[time=3216] The Bible makes it very clear that we are going to serve somebody.
[time=3222] If you remember reading the Epistles, quite often Paul began by saying, "I, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ." James 1-1, "James, a blind servant of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve tribes that are scattered abroad."
[time=3241] Jesus said, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me."
[time=3248] Servanthood, denial, surrender.
[time=3251] We're going to serve somebody.
[time=3255] Jesus simply is giving us the reality that we can choose who we will serve.
[time=3260] We can serve him or we can serve Mammon.
[time=3264] To the best of my ability to translate Mammon is a word that means materialism,
[time=3270] or as the NIV, New International Translation puts it, money.
[time=3275] We are going to serve one of those two.
[time=3278] Many of us who have Christ as our Savior are serving Christ, but we're dangerously walking and flirting with another master, the master of materialism.
[time=3291] Many of us have betrayed and left our first master and surrendered to the old.
[time=3299] Who will we serve?
[time=3301] Jesus says, "You can't serve them both." Writing on the Sermon on the Mount, Martin Lloyd Jones, an English preacher of the last century
[time=3312] gave this illustration of being pulled between the two masters of Mammon and the Lord.
[time=3318] So the farmer was so excited because his cow gave birth to two calves, one brown and one white.
[time=3326] And explaining his enthusiasm at these twin cows that were born, he told his wife, "I'm going to raise them both and I'm going to give one of them to the Lord." She said, "Well, which one are you going to give the Lord?" He said, "Oh, I'm not sure we'll decide that later on." A few months later, the decision had not been made and one of the cows died.
[time=3345] He walked in and said, "Honey, a bad thing happened today.
[time=3348] God's calf died." Isn't that how we are?
[time=3355] Sure is how I am.
[time=3358] God, you're first, right after me, right after me.
[time=3365] If we're going to be masters of our money and not mastered by it, we're going to have to surrender to the right master.
[time=3373] Giving our heart first to the Lord as Savior and receiving Christ and secondly to surrender to His Word to follow it day by day.
[time=3385] The anti-establishment singer of the 60s, Bob Dylan was converted.
[time=3392] And in the 70s, he's saying, "You're going to serve somebody.
[time=3396] Everybody's got to serve somebody.
[time=3398] It may be the devil or it may be the Lord.
[time=3402] But you're going to serve somebody.
[time=3405] Who will you serve this day?" Joshua said, "As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord."
[time=3413] Will you serve Him?
[time=3414] Will you surrender to Him today and receive Him as Savior?
[time=3417] Having done that with your walk in obedience, I pray that you will.
