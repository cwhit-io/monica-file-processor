[time=55] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=62] It's the Bible Hour.

[time=73] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=76] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=174] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=176] - This morning our choir has prepared for us a medley of hymns that talk about our relationship to the Lord, our relationship to each other, the desire that God would bind us together with cords that could not be broken, that his spirit would lead us in growth, and then to sing in that medley songs of recognition of his majesty, and then finally to end up with his sovereignty that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=203] Is he Lord of your heart today?
[time=205] I pray that he is.
[time=206] We're thankful that you've come today to this place that we can worship together, and want to say a word of welcomeness and thankfulness to our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.

[time=218] The God will use music, his spirit and his word to bind our hearts together, and to bring praise and recognition to the fact that he is Lord.
[time=227] Listen now as our choir ministers to us in song, and teaches us those truths.

[time=1549] Thank you, Missy.
[time=1552] Missy's a part of our church and our school.
[time=1555] These are busy and exciting days in the life of both our church and school.
[time=1560] Our school has been in existence for a number of years and we've been working hard over the years to get full and complete accreditation.
[time=1568] And last year, that was granted by the state of Indiana.
[time=1572] We were reviewed and fully accredited in all of our programming from the little ones in kindergarten all the way through the seniors in high school and when that became available to us and we were accredited, we had the privilege then of participating in a lot of the activities.
[time=1587] And one of those is the Indiana High School Athletic Association.
[time=1591] Much to our disappointment, the first game of the basketball sectionals is on the same night as our Constitution says our business meeting has to be.
[time=1601] We're looking forward to our team playing this year in the sectional in Columbia City on Wednesday night and we were hoping that could be just a church celebration of something like your child coming of age.
[time=1612] You know, there are milestones in the life of our children and for our school, that is such a visualization of our accreditation and accomplishment.
[time=1620] We are wanting to make that a church celebration and yet we're not able to do that because our Constitution and articles of incorporation say that congregational business meeting shall be the last Wednesday of February.
[time=1633] Then on top of that, we were only allotted about 100 to 150 tickets so we all couldn't go anyway.
[time=1639] So we have a conflict this Wednesday night and we want to say how excited we are for our school and we want you who have tickets to feel free to be there.
[time=1649] I know that Wednesday night is a traditional night for church and that is our business meeting and that is important but the development of our children and them knowing that they have our support is also very important and we don't want to cause a division and we are excited about both opportunities.
[time=1666] Fortunately, we're a big enough church that we can do both.
[time=1668] If you're here, we thank God for that.
[time=1670] If you're at the basketball game, we thank God for that and we're not gonna make that a test of spirituality whether you're in church.
[time=1677] If someone does and they make that a test of spirituality, then you know that they weren't the ones who got the few tickets that were available.
[time=1685] (audience laughs) Well, this Wednesday night, we will meet.
[time=1689] We'll have our business meeting and another section of the congregation will be meeting in Columbia City, one of my friends who is a deacon in our church called and explained that he wasn't going to be there for the business meeting, that he was going to be out of town and I just sympathized with this and then I said, wait a minute, what town are you gonna be in?
[time=1708] He's gonna be in Columbia City and that's all right.
[time=1710] (audience laughs) You know, God's blessed us.
[time=1713] You know, to have a school that teaches our children academic excellence on the biblical foundation to tremendous privilege that we have.
[time=1721] We thank God for that.
[time=1722] He's blessed us in some other ways.
[time=1724] Last December, we talked as a church about trying to sell half of 131 acres in Arlington Park and we made that as an act of our congregations approval.
[time=1735] We've gone from all the things that you do in real estate.
[time=1738] You know, when you buy a house, that's a quarter of an acre.
[time=1742] Usually you multiply that till you come up to 65 acres and you can imagine all the details that are involved but just last week, everything was signed and it's all complete.
[time=1751] It goes to the Allen County Planning Commission on Wednesday.
[time=1755] It should have already been there but the meeting was snowed out when the county closed all of their offices two weeks ago.
[time=1761] It's not even being contested.
[time=1763] So it should go through.
[time=1764] We trust that it will.
[time=1765] We're praying to that end.
[time=1766] We thank God for His goodness.
[time=1768] That's something we've worked on, prayed for, for four years.
[time=1771] God has made it available in these days and we give Him the thanks.
[time=1775] Father, we thank you for the goodness that you have given to this body of people.
[time=1780] God, we think of the Lord Jesus Christ and we stand amazed in His presence.
[time=1785] To think that the King of glory would die for our sins.
[time=1790] Oh, God, we're unworthy today but we come to you with love and adoration and thank you for the forgiveness and the cleansing and the new life that we have in Christ.
[time=1799] We thank you for your word that gives direction to us that's a lamp unto a feet and a light under our path.
[time=1806] God, we thank you for your spirit that causes us to be sensitive to you and to your kingdom.
[time=1811] God, we thank you for your physical blessings, for a body of people who serve with diligence and commitment, for people who give week by week faithfully is under the Lord, for those who have labored to make possible even the transaction and that you have blessed and land has been sold and new opportunities are ahead of us.
[time=1833] God, we thank you.
[time=1834] Father, we thank you for our school and those who had sacrificed labor to provide education that is excellent but education that is founded and committed to the truth of your word.
[time=1845] God, we thank you for the time in which we live today to know these blessings.
[time=1851] You have been good and we give you thanks and yet Father, our heart beats with hurt for those who today in their own life it's not a point of rejoicing.
[time=1861] We pray for friends today who would be sitting in a hospital waiting room holding the balance and prayer between life and death for a loved one.
[time=1869] Oh God, we pray that you would give strength and courage to hearts.
[time=1873] Father, we pray for those who battle with cancer for Mary Lantman, for Catherine Northrup, for Harry Bennett.
[time=1881] God gives strength and courage for each day.
[time=1884] Father, the numbers are greater than our own mind can comprehend but we trust you to know the needs of each one.
[time=1890] We pray for those who are in the valley of emotional distress and broken relationships.
[time=1895] Father, we pray that there might be a word of encouragement even this morning from you.
[time=1901] As we open up our hearts in your word, God, we ask you to speak to each of our hearts with diversity of need, may there be centrality of your spirit ministry for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1913] Today we do encourage you to study the scriptures with us to the very reference point for life.
[time=1920] Jesus said, search the scriptures for there which testify of me.
[time=1925] It's only through the word of God that we have knowledge of the Son of God and the changing and the transforming and the newness of life that he can give.
[time=1934] It's only through the scriptures as the spirit of God would illuminate our hearts and our minds that we begin to see principles that give direction to order our families, to order our lives.
[time=1944] We study them today.
[time=1946] Open your Bibles with us that we can look together at Matthew chapter six and verses 25 through 34.
[time=1954] I would like to read those for you right now.
[time=1956] Matthew six, verse 25.
[time=1960] Therefore, I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body, what you shall put on, is not the life more than meat and the body more than rain-ment.
[time=1979] Behold, the fowls of the air, for they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.
[time=1991] Are you not much better than they?
[time=1994] Which of you by taking thought can add one cue but unto a stature?
[time=1999] And why take you thought for rain-ment?
[time=2003] Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you that even Solomon, in all of his glory, was not arrayed as one of these.
[time=2018] Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field,
[time=2024] which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith.
[time=2036] Therefore, take no thought saying, what shall we eat?
[time=2041] What shall we drink?
[time=2042] Wherewith all shall we be clothed?
[time=2045] For after these things do the gentile seek, for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of these things.
[time=2052] But seek ye first, the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you.
[time=2063] Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.
[time=2069] Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
[time=2074] The Lord Jesus Christ, speaking on one of the most prominent, most precarious issues of life, and that of the fine art of mastering our money.
[time=2088] Last week we began to look at verses 19, and we were able to glean some principles that I trust made sense and application to your life.
[time=2098] Let me just review for you what Jesus taught in what we read last week on learning to master our money.
[time=2105] Jesus said, lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, instead treasures in heaven.
[time=2111] It was actually calling us, first of all, to establish the ultimate priorities of our life.
[time=2116] For what kingdom will we work?
[time=2118] For what will we labor?
[time=2119] What is the value system that we uphold?
[time=2122] Is our life simply a laboring, a striving to build a kingdom here today to accomplish our own dynasty?
[time=2130] Or do we live for another kingdom?
[time=2132] Are our values of a different culture a heavenly one?
[time=2136] First of all, we must establish ultimate priorities.
[time=2141] Secondly, Jesus would teach something as clear and as simple is that if we're ever going to control our appetites, we must control our eyes.
[time=2149] That is through the eyes, the window of the soul that we begin to tease the appetite into its insatiable desire for more.
[time=2159] Window shopping, a very expensive hobby.
[time=2164] Control the eyes to control the appetite.
[time=2167] Thirdly, last week, Jesus taught that we must surrender to him as master.
[time=2173] He said, no man can serve two masters.
[time=2175] We can't serve the God of materialism with the goal of accumulation and serve the Lord Jesus Christ at the same time.
[time=2183] The inevitable truth of the scriptures is that we are going to serve somebody.
[time=2187] The only choice we have is whom we will serve.
[time=2191] The greatest delusion, the great deception of the adversary is the myth that we are free and that we do not serve someone.
[time=2201] We live for ourselves.
[time=2202] But who would want to be described as self-serving?
[time=2206] And yet, that is the deception that we can serve and live for ourselves.
[time=2210] The scripture teaches that we either live for the God of this world, the adversary Satan, or we live for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2218] Who will you serve?
[time=2220] Well, this week, as we moved on in Jesus' words, we discovered some additional principles.
[time=2225] First for today, our fourth, if you're continuing it from last week as I am, I believe Jesus teaches this principle very clearly.
[time=2232] He says, stop worrying about financial concerns.
[time=2239] It says that three times in the text.
[time=2242] And the King James Bible says, therefore, I say and you take no thought for the moral.
[time=2248] The word there that the King James is using as thought is the word that actually and more accurately means to worry.
[time=2256] The new international version translates it that way.
[time=2258] It says this.
[time=2259] Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life.
[time=2263] Three times versus 25, 31, and 34, Jesus is the same thing.
[time=2268] Don't worry.
[time=2272] Let's just take a moment and define what worry is.
[time=2277] Trying to collect ideas from dictionaries and insights from life, I would define worry as unwarranted concern.
[time=2287] A preoccupation with problems or potential problems.
[time=2292] And it's usually the second, isn't it?
[time=2295] It's not the preoccupation with the problems as the potential problems, the great what-ifs of life, the tomorrows that are filled with a vague sense of uncertainty.
[time=2307] Worry is that preoccupation that leads to negative feelings of emotion, of anxiety, fear,
[time=2316] apprehension, distrust, suspicion, wanting to avoid the tomorrows, a sense of being driven and consumed by what may happen, a loss of balance and joy,
[time=2330] perspective being twisted and distorted, that preoccupation with problems, that excess of planning, worry.
[time=2343] Now again, let's repeat something we said last week.
[time=2345] The scripture is here not saying, don't plan,
[time=2351] nor is it saying, don't plan ahead.
[time=2354] There is a place for planning.
[time=2356] There is a place for strategy.
[time=2358] There is a place for a long-range goal setting.
[time=2361] There is a place to plan and to save for the future and to provide for security as best we are able.
[time=2367] But there can come that excessiveness of concern called worry.
[time=2373] Jesus here would say, don't worry.
[time=2376] But what is rather interesting is what he says not to worry about.
[time=2379] I've labeled it financial concerns.
[time=2383] But Jesus keeps it very basic.
[time=2385] Look what he says, don't worry about what?
[time=2389] Three things, basic to life.
[time=2392] He said, don't worry about what you're going to eat.
[time=2395] Don't worry about what you're going to drink.
[time=2398] Don't worry about shelter and clothing for the body.
[time=2401] That's getting down to the basics.
[time=2404] Now, the day I'm sensitive to the fact that there are those a part of this body, perhaps more by way of television, who those basics are real concern to them.
[time=2414] That because of unemployment or underemployment or long periods of time without a job, financial reverses, hardships that have come, that really there is a struggle for the daily needs of food and water and clothing.
[time=2429] May God give us sensitivity.
[time=2431] But yet, it is almost a point of humor for most of us.
[time=2437] For most of us, we're not sitting here saying, how am I going to get food?
[time=2442] Most of us are saying, how can I get away from food?
[time=2444] Jesus would say, don't worry about those basic things.
[time=2453] And if he can say, we shouldn't need to worry about the things that cause life to survive, then I think it's safe for us to realize he's not considered and appropriate for us to worry about the excesses of all that we have.
[time=2467] You know, the interesting thing, that once a person has resources that go beyond his ability to provide simply for the basics of food and drink and clothing, there doesn't come a freedom from worry.
[time=2480] Actually, the anxiety and the worry grows with the possessions.
[time=2485] Our possessions don't free us up from worry.
[time=2487] They actually become an occasion for more worry, more stress, more anxiety, more need for planning, more fear of what ifs.
[time=2498] Jesus would say, stop worrying.
[time=2503] Why would he say that?
[time=2504] He said, therefore, therefore is a clause of conclusion or relationship by conclusion.
[time=2511] Therefore, it's simply saying based upon what we've already said, it is logical for us now to say.
[time=2517] He is saying based upon the fact that we've surrendered our lives to Jesus Christ as Lord.
[time=2523] Assuming that we've done that, therefore, we don't need to worry.
[time=2529] I jokingly said my life verse was Hezekiah 2.
[time=2534] For those of you not real well versed in the Bible, there's a king by the name of Hezekiah, but there's no book of Hezekiah in the Bible.
[time=2541] So this is Hox's free translation of Hezekiah 2, too.
[time=2545] It says, swept down not the small stuff.
[time=2549] So many times, the anxieties of our life are disproportionate to their significance.
[time=2556] I used to have what I called a frustration scale.
[time=2559] One to 10, or one is you didn't get the trash taken out before the trash man got there.
[time=2565] A 10 is the death of a close friend.
[time=2568] Most of us, everything, is a 10.
[time=2573] We're filled with the anxiety and the frustration and the worry because of the complexities of life that are caused because we have so much.
[time=2583] Jesus would say, stop worrying.
[time=2586] Stop worrying.
[time=2588] Now, he goes into a rather lengthy explanation of why he would say that.
[time=2593] I believe Jesus supports that statement of stop worrying in at least five ways.
[time=2598] The first one he says is this, worry is inappropriate.
[time=2602] Look at the first verse of our study, 25.
[time=2605] Take no thought for your life, what you're going to eat, drink, or for clothing for your body.
[time=2611] Now, look at this statement, is not life more than meat
[time=2617] and the body more than clothing?
[time=2620] You know what Jesus was saying?
[time=2621] There's more to life than materialism.
[time=2624] There's more to life than just simply eat and drink and have clothing.
[time=2629] He's saying that our values are animalistic if we're simply making the consideration of our life the physical needs.
[time=2637] Is that all we are, a physical being?
[time=2640] Are we nothing more than a brutish ape that has overgrown and over-intelligent?
[time=2647] No.
[time=2648] There is more to life than just an animal-like existence of survival of the fittest.
[time=2655] There is to life values, emotional, spiritual, psychological needs that all of us possess and that no matter how much of food, how much of clothing, how much of all the materialism can bring that can never be met because the basic needs of men and women are not primarily physical, they are primarily spiritual.
[time=2678] Life consists not in the abundance of the things that a man possesses, but it consists in a man's relationship with God that he can know acceptance and cleansing and forgiveness, that he can know that his life has purpose and value.
[time=2694] There is no significance that comes to life through accumulation.
[time=2698] Significance is only achieved by knowing that you're a child of God, that you've been redeemed, and that he calls you his own, and that we belong to him.
[time=2709] That's when we can say, I am somebody.
[time=2713] I am a son of God, I'm a daughter of God by the new birth.
[time=2716] Not that I've earned it, not that I've married it, but that God by his grace would love and forgive.
[time=2722] My life has significance, it has value.
[time=2726] Oh, there can come a sense of security, that the more that we possess, the more secure that we feel, but often then we begin to trust in our riches, and our riches begin to rust, the mobs begin to eat, and the protection of our security becomes a preoccupation and leads to greater insecurity.
[time=2746] Security can only come when I know not what the future holds, but I know him who holds the future.
[time=2753] Life consists not in the abundance of the things that a man or a woman possesses, but in the relationship that he possesses or she possesses with God in the relationships that we have with people, learning to love, learning to be tolerant, learning to forbear, to accept, to be winsome, to say from the bottom of the heart,
[time=2782] I'm sorry, values.
[time=2787] Life consists of more than the accumulation of much.
[time=2791] Jesus would say worry is inappropriate, because it begins to say that all that we are is a physical being.
[time=2800] Is there not more to life than all that?
[time=2803] There's got to be.
[time=2806] Secondly, Jesus would say that worry is inconsistent with common sense.
[time=2813] He gives two illustrations.
[time=2815] He says, look at the birds.
[time=2818] He says, do birds sow?
[time=2820] Do you ever see a bird claim a plot of ground?
[time=2823] I said, this is my turf.
[time=2825] I'm going to plant this year.
[time=2827] Do you ever see a bird harvest fretting the rain, waiting for the time when the moisture level is just right and the crops so they can go harvest it?
[time=2837] Do you ever see a bird build a barn?
[time=2840] Again, notice what Jesus said.
[time=2842] Behold, the fouls of the air, for they do not sow.
[time=2846] Neither do they reap.
[time=2847] Neither do they gather into barns.
[time=2849] Yet your heavenly Father feed at them.
[time=2852] Are you much more valuable than they?
[time=2855] Jesus' whole point is this.
[time=2856] Common sense teaches us that God will take care of us, because if he takes care of the little birds that nest and fly through the air, he'll take care of all of us, his people, the ones that he's created in his own image.
[time=2873] Common sense teaches us that worry is inconsistent with faith in Christ.
[time=2880] Not only that, he gives a second illustration.
[time=2883] He said, behold, the grass of the field.
[time=2886] No doubt now, he means not just some wild weeds, but some wild, flowering grass of the field.
[time=2892] How did it springs forth with beauty?
[time=2895] And then he makes a point of contrast between these flowering grass.
[time=2900] And the most elegant, beautiful, wealthiest person in the history of Israel, Solomon.
[time=2905] And he says, not even Solomon, in all of his glory and splendor, had as much beauty as these.
[time=2912] Then he made the point that these plants, these little flowers, are temporary, and they're going to pass away.
[time=2918] The heat of the day like an oven, scorches them.
[time=2921] They wither and die.
[time=2922] And yet, if God clothed those plants with such beauty, common sense teaches us that God will take care of us.
[time=2931] That worry is inconsistent with common sense.
[time=2936] Thirdly, Jesus makes the point that worry is absolutely ineffective.
[time=2942] Look at verse 27.
[time=2945] He says this, which of you, by taking thought, can add one qubit to a stature?
[time=2951] The word there being translated of qubit is often the word span, which means a distance.
[time=2956] It can mean a distance and linear measurement or it can mean a distance and time.
[time=2962] Jesus' point was one of the two.
[time=2964] Which of us by worrying can add any height to our stature?
[time=2969] Or which of us by worrying can add any time to his life?
[time=2975] No matter which way you translate it, the point is obvious.
[time=2979] Worry is not going to make us grow any taller.
[time=2983] Nor is worry going to make us live any longer.
[time=2987] Worry is absolutely unproductive and ineffective.
[time=2991] Not only can worry not add time to our life, it may actually in effect take time off of our life.
[time=2998] Kenneth Anderson writes, there is no disputing the fact that nine times out of 10 worrying about the thing does more damage to those who worry than the actual thing itself.
[time=3010] What he is saying there is if you and I are worrying about a particular event and the consequences of that event should it happen, the worrying that we're doing is going to do far more damage to us than if that unfortunate event does take place.
[time=3025] He continues, modern medical research has proved that worry breaks down resistance to disease.
[time=3032] More than that, it actually diseases the nervous system, particularly the digestive organs and heart.
[time=3039] Add to this the toll and unhappiness of sleepless nights, days void of internal sunshine, and you have a glimpse of the work of this monster in destroying the effectiveness of the human body.
[time=3053] It is plain, common sense that worry has no right place in most of us worry.
[time=3060] It's absolutely ineffective.
[time=3064] Fourthly, Jesus says that worry is incompatible with Christian faith.
[time=3070] Finally, as he moves through all these arguments, Jesus says in verse 30, "All ye of little faith." His point is this, "If we had true trust and faith in God, then we wouldn't be prone to worry." It's as simple as one man put it, "When you're worrying, you're not trusting.
[time=3090] And when you're trusting, you're not worrying.
[time=3092] The two are mutually exclusive, aren't they?
[time=3095] I cannot worry and trust at the same time." Jesus has remarked that worry is incompatible with true faith in Christ.
[time=3106] "If we're trusting God, then why are we worrying?" Said the robin to the sparrow.
[time=3116] "I should really like to know why these anxious human beings, Russian worry so." Said the sparrow to the robin, "Friend, I think that it must be that they have no Heavenly Father, such as cares for you and me." When we worry, we show that we really don't have faith in God.
[time=3140] We're saying we don't have a Heavenly Father.
[time=3142] And if we do, we certainly can't trust Him.
[time=3146] If we truly have faith in Jesus Christ, then worry is absolutely inconsistent.
[time=3153] Finally, I believe Jesus' argument is this, that we should stop worrying because worry overloads our system.
[time=3162] The last verse of this chapter says, "Take no thought for tomorrow, and all of its troubles, for the tomorrow shall take thought for itself, sufficient to the day as the evil thereof." What he is saying is each day has its own frustrations, its own anxiety, its own bitterness, its own worries.
[time=3182] Don't reach into the future and borrow tomorrow's worry so you can live them out today because each day has enough worry in it that that's all we're going to be able to handle is today.
[time=3194] And we're going to overload our system with anxiety if we keep adding to today's legitimate concerns tomorrow's possible concerns.
[time=3203] We'll overload our system.
[time=3205] Live a day at a time.
[time=3207] So Jesus has argued that we must stop worrying
[time=3214] and secondly today, we need to focus our attention on a whole new point.
[time=3218] As we continue from last week, this is our fifth and final point in learning to master our money.
[time=3225] It is this, that we must start being ambitious for the kingdom of God.
[time=3238] In verses 32 and 33, Jesus uses the same word twice.
[time=3244] He uses it first in a negative way and then secondly in a positive way.
[time=3250] In verse 32, he tells us not only not to worry about all the material things that money can buy mammon as he called it in verse 24.
[time=3259] He said, "For after these things do the Gentiles seek." Now by Gentile, he means not just someone who is not born ethnically a Jew.
[time=3268] He's meaning someone who is estranged from the promises of God.
[time=3273] It means anyone who's not a believer in God and trusting in God.
[time=3277] It means anyone today who hasn't received Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=3280] He is saying the unspiritual minded person seeks after these things.
[time=3286] That's our word, seek.
[time=3289] He said, "The Gentiles seek after this, but you in contrast seek after something totally different." And then he names two things, the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[time=3301] By seek, we mean to have a diligent appetite for.
[time=3304] We mean to be ambitious for it to make it our life's purpose.
[time=3307] What is your life pursuing today?
[time=3310] What is it that you live for?
[time=3312] Do you live for money?
[time=3314] Do you live for what money can buy?
[time=3316] Do you live for the television set?
[time=3319] What do you live for?
[time=3321] What is your ambition?
[time=3322] What is it you're trying to achieve with your life?
[time=3325] Jesus had seek the kingdom of God.
[time=3329] Interesting fact, he says, "If we indeed seek the kingdom of God, then all of these things shall be added unto us." What did he mean by that?
[time=3337] He meant the material needs of our lives.
[time=3340] They'll be met if we simply set our ambitions on him, then he'll meet our every need.
[time=3346] I want to be honest with you, the passage doesn't say, "Jesus' remark was not, "Seek only the kingdom of God, ignore the need for food, ignore the need for shelter." No, he just said, "Seek the kingdom first." These other things are legitimate concerns in life, but the chief concern of our life, the chief ambition, has got to be the kingdom of heaven and his righteousness.
[time=3369] Right now, I'd like to invite you to take an inventory of your life.
[time=3373] What is it that you're really seeking for?
[time=3376] Take out your family calendar.
[time=3378] Do you have one of those?
[time=3379] Are your personal pocket reminder?
[time=3381] And review how you've invested your life for the last few weeks or months.
[time=3386] By looking at your calendar, does it show that you're really ambitious, seeking for the kingdom of God?
[time=3392] Or is the affairs of God's work been squeezed out of your life?
[time=3396] Many of you are home watching television right now.
[time=3399] We're thankful for this television ministry that can reach in the hospitals and homes and reaching those who can't come.
[time=3406] And perhaps reaching those who don't know Christ and aren't willing to come.
[time=3410] But for too many, the Bible hours become the first church of the Holy Convenience.
[time=3415] We stay at home when we really should be in this church or in some church serving the Lord, investing ourself in his kingdom instead of our own comfort.
[time=3425] Take out your checkbook.
[time=3427] Review how you've spent your money.
[time=3429] Does it really reflect the fact that you're seeking first the kingdom of heaven?
[time=3433] If it's not, stop worrying and start working for the kingdom of heaven.
[time=3438] And that begins by receiving Christ as Savior.
[time=3441] Have you received Him?
[time=3442] If not, I pray that you'll do that right now.
[time=3445] Thank you for tuning into the Bible hour today.
