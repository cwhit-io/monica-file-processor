[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=30] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] Now live from the Convocation Center
[time=58] of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=62] It's the Bible Hour with inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=73] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=88] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=132] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=139] Again, it is our joy on this Sunday to proclaim the fact that our God is a great God and great is His love and concern for us.
[time=149] You today may be filled with anxiety and care.
[time=153] Jesus invites us to take all of our anxiety and all of our care and to bring them to Him and to cast our care upon Him for He cares for us.
[time=163] We're delighted today that we can worship the Lord Jesus Christ and want to say a special word of welcome to our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=172] Literally every week through the mail and in person, we hear from people who, by means of television, have either had their faith in Christ strengthened or have been encouraged or have come to know Christ as Savior and we want to welcome you today to our church family through television.
[time=187] And to those of you who are here, we have the privilege of assembling and encouraging each other today and to take our care and our anxiety and to place it on the Lord Jesus Christ because He cares for us.
[time=199] The choir this morning sings of that spiritual truth, all of our anxiety and all of our care.

[time=452] Let's sing about that in hymn number 238.
[time=455] I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus.
[time=458] We'll sing the first and second stanzas together.

[time=668] We talked about telling him our trials and troubles.
[time=671] But I say, too, I must tell Jesus, telling him to others for what he means to me.
[time=676] I greet you in his name this morning.
[time=678] It's a joy to be here.
[time=680] As I look out over the audience, I see many familiar faces and friends.
[time=684] Men that mean a lot to me.
[time=688] Causes Ann and my wife and I to feel that Blackhawk Baptist Church, you people, are kind of a second home church family to us.
[time=696] Many of the people that God has brought into our lives to stretch and challenge us are right here, including Pastor Rick, and I thank God for them.
[time=704] We thank God for your commitment.
[time=706] Your commitment to preach the written Word of God and the living Word of God, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=712] And we thank you for your encouragement and for your prayers and your support which enable us to have the privilege of serving God in CBMC.
[time=722] And as Rick has said, through that, to be an extension of your ministry in Fort Wayne and through television in South Bend, Indiana.
[time=730] We are your missionaries to Judea and Samaria.
[time=733] In this case, Judea and Samaria happen to be Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky.
[time=738] That's the area of ministry in CBMC that God has given to us, given us a vision for, a heart for, and challenged us to serve him in.
[time=747] And so we go out as your missionaries there.
[time=751] CBMC is a little different in that it's a ministry where it isn't just someone you support someplace else, but it's a ministry that you can, in fact, take advantage of and use in your own lives as well.
[time=762] What is CBMC?
[time=764] It stands for Christian Business Men's Committee.
[time=767] It's men, businessmen, men in the marketplace who know Jesus Christ and who have a deepening understanding of God's purpose for their lives, why he has them, where he has them in the marketplace.
[time=782] Their purpose is simply to present Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord to other business and professional men, and then to help Christian men grow and develop to disciple them in order that they too can be a part of carrying out the Great Commission.
[time=798] Certainly our purpose is not unique.
[time=800] That's the purpose that God has for every one of his people, to be about the Great Commission.
[time=805] But as a group of men, CBMC is somewhat unique because it's, to our knowledge, the only group that has the focus of reaching men in the marketplace.
[time=814] Often we think of the down and outer as the person to be reached, but what about the up and outer?
[time=819] The man who's sitting at the top, the pinnacle of success in the world's eyes, the head of businesses at the heads of governments, but who's just as lost, just as lonely, and just as desperately in need of knowing Jesus Christ in a vital and personal way.
[time=833] Who will reach them?
[time=834] That's the ministry, the mission of CBMC, the focus of the men of CBMC.
[time=839] How do we do that?
[time=841] Well, we use the scriptural principles that God has given to us, the pattern that he's laid out.
[time=847] We pray for men that we know right here in our own community.
[time=850] Every morning there's a group that meets somewhere in this town of Fort Wayne, and I might add there's a new group that's just beginning to meet in South Bend, and simply by writing the Bible hour, you could find out who to contact up there to plug into that.
[time=864] But men meet the purpose of praying for men that they know right around them in Fort Wayne who don't know Jesus Christ, or at least to our knowledge, don't know him.
[time=873] And then we work to build relationships with them, to let them see Jesus Christ in us and to show our care for them.
[time=880] We invite them to opportunities where they can hear the gospel presented by a businessman,
[time=886] somebody who has credibility with them, who shares the pressures and the problems that they do, and yet who can share what Jesus Christ means to him and the relevance that Christ has in his life as a businessman.
[time=898] We do this at breakfast, at lunches, sometimes at dinners, after the service, if you're interested in knowing more about those, I'd be happy to tell you about them.
[time=907] But we don't stop there.
[time=909] Yes, we sold a seed, but we follow it up.
[time=913] We call on the men who have been guests in order to find out where they are personally in their spiritual lives, and then try to help them take that next step forward, whatever it might be, whether it's coming to know Jesus Christ, or in the case of a man who already knows him or comes to know Christ, to help him begin to grow, to disciple him, to get him established in the basics that are so essential to building our relationship with God, and then helping him to learn to be a reproducer.
[time=939] As the Holy Spirit gives opportunity, we'll encourage him to plug into a solid Bible preaching Christ teaching church, like Black Hawk Baptist, where he can continue to grow.
[time=949] But then we'll continue to invest in that man's life, helping him to grow to spiritual maturity, helping him to become a spiritual leader in his home, in his church, and in the place of business where God has put him.
[time=963] So that's the heartbeat, the strategy of CBMC.
[time=966] Really, in a sense, there's nothing very magical about this, nothing very new.
[time=970] It's what each and every one of us can do on his own.
[time=974] But I don't know how you are, but I find my intentions go far beyond my performance.
[time=979] What I want to do and what I do, there's usually a gap.
[time=983] And what we've learned in CBMC is that by banding together men of like heart, men who can encourage and equip us, who can show us how that that performance and intention come much closer together.
[time=997] Through the tools and the training, the approaches that we've learned and proven through the years in CBMC, we find that we can be more fruitful, that we can see the fruit of other lives that God wants to work in and through our lives.
[time=1013] And of course, this fruitfulness is God's desire for each one of us.
[time=1017] John 15, 16 has always been an important verse to me.
[time=1021] Jesus says, "You didn't choose me, but I chose you and ordained you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain." And in the context of that passage, Jesus is talking about the fruit of other lives.
[time=1035] Men and women who've come to know Christ and are going on to live for Him as a result of our lives.
[time=1043] I'd ask us this morning, have we seen that fruit in our lives?
[time=1047] Have you in your life seen that fruit?
[time=1050] Who's your man? Who's your woman?
[time=1052] Who is the person that because of you today is walking with Jesus Christ and living a fruit-bearing life of their own?
[time=1062] As I've worked with men, I've come to realize that there are a number of reasons why it is that maybe there's so little fruit that we see in our lives.
[time=1071] I've never met anyone, any Christian, who didn't want to be fruitful.
[time=1075] That was his desire, his wish, his intention.
[time=1078] But what I see happening is there are a number of things that cause us to be unfruitful.
[time=1083] To be that third kind of person, that third group that Jesus described in the parable of the sword, the seed that sprouts up, but then is choked off
[time=1094] and left unfruitful.
[time=1096] People who no question know Jesus Christ, but are seeing no fruit through their lives.
[time=1102] I could touch on several of these, but let me just hit a couple of key ones.
[time=1105] One is no preparation and no plans to prepare.
[time=1111] We just seem to sit and wait for God to do something, to zap us, if you will, and make us fruitful
[time=1117] and not realize that we need to get ourselves prepared, that there are opportunities.
[time=1123] Rick mentioned the lifestyle evangelism seminar.
[time=1126] I know what an impact that had in my own life.
[time=1128] There's an opportunity where I saw I could become better equipped, better prepared to relate, to build those bridges of relationship with the people around me that God has put there as my sphere of influence, as my platform of people to reach.
[time=1143] So there's an opportunity.
[time=1145] What will you do about that, or similar opportunities?
[time=1149] Will you take the step of helping to prepare yourself so that God has a vessel through whom to work?
[time=1155] That's one of the problems I see.
[time=1157] I see many others.
[time=1159] We draw on our own power, not gods.
[time=1161] We fail to pray for people.
[time=1164] We're not praying for them.
[time=1165] We probably don't care much about them.
[time=1167] A lot of these boil down to the issue of priorities.
[time=1170] Will I make time for it?
[time=1172] Will I leave that as the last thing on the agenda, the thing that seldom, if ever, gets done?
[time=1177] Or will I make it the priority of my life that Christ wants it to be?
[time=1182] And behind that, the thing that I've learned above all, I think, is that our love for people
[time=1188] and thus the priority they are in my life will never be greater than my love for God.
[time=1194] I cannot love others more than I love God.
[time=1197] What's your experience today?
[time=1200] What kind of a love do you have for God?
[time=1204] In the hymn, "I Would Trust Jesus," we talk about having a love that's a living fire in our hearts.
[time=1213] Is that the experience that you know when you think of God?
[time=1216] What does that generate?
[time=1217] Is there a fire within you as you think of Him?
[time=1221] Or is it all kind of a second-hand thing as we come to worship together and so forth?
[time=1225] All kind of second-hand.
[time=1227] What is your love for God?
[time=1235] I find that I have to make choices in order to let God really become a living fire in my life.
[time=1243] The love that I have for my wife didn't happen without some effort.
[time=1247] I spent a lot of time with her.
[time=1249] She became a focus of my thoughts in my life.
[time=1253] That's what God wants to be. He says, "Love me with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength." Jesus asked, "Peter, do you love me?" What place do we give Him in our mind and in our attention?
[time=1264] What step will we take, even a small one, this week, apart from this service of worship this morning,
[time=1270] where will one-on-one, as I say, eyeball to eyeball, get with God and say, "God, what do you want to do in my life?
[time=1277] I want to know you better and I want you to have at me." We sang, the choir sang the hymn a little bit ago, "Jesus is our prayer." We sang a hymn talking about asking Jesus to help us.
[time=1290] But maybe we need to start with the prayer, "Jesus, help yourself to me."
[time=1296] The first thing on the agenda is whatever's on your agenda.
[time=1299] I want you to have at me and change my life.
[time=1302] Let me see you as you are.
[time=1304] Let me see who I am because of you.
[time=1310] And as I see God in that way, I can't help but love Him.
[time=1314] And then I can't help but have the same love and priority that He has, people.
[time=1319] He loved you, He loved me, He loves us, and He loves those who don't know Him yet.
[time=1324] And He wants us to love them too.
[time=1327] We will do that as we love Him.
[time=1329] So my challenge, my prayer for you today, is that one small thing, don't leave here today.
[time=1335] Don't turn off your TV set today without having made one decision, a small one even, this week
[time=1342] to do something that will enable you to know God better personally, to love Him more.
[time=1348] It's great to be here. God bless you.
[time=1365] [MUSIC]
[time=1382] Unbound at grace, it reached to me.
[time=1394] When hope was gone from view.
[time=1407] In my despair, Christ came to me as He alone would do.
[time=1433] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=1453] I once was lost, but now I am found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=1479] When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun.
[time=1503] We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.
[time=1528] Unbound at grace, amazing grace.
[time=1546] [MUSIC]
[time=1562] Amazing grace.
[time=1576] Again we want to welcome you to the Bible Party. Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1581] We've broken away from the live morning worship service to these brief moments with you so that we can talk directly with our television family.
[time=1589] Hello, Pete, how are you going? Good morning. I'm just fine. Being an ex-marion giant, you're probably very excited about the basketball championship.
[time=1597] I watched that game and I thought they were just awesome. You were a little bit prejudiced to begin.
[time=1603] It's a busy time for you. Easter is just around the corner and the Easter musical is coming up with a lot of practices and work yet.
[time=1611] Yes, we have a lot of work to do this week. In fact, we're excited about the fact that the Sunnycrest Baptist Church is going to join us this week for our rehearsals.
[time=1619] And we'd like to remind everyone that's watching that we'll be presenting exaltation with the Sunnycrest Baptist Church on April 7th at 5 p.m. and 7.30.
[time=1629] This is a great collection of worship songs that will bless the hearts of our people. We'd like to invite you to come.
[time=1636] You do need a ticket and the tickets are available at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. You can call 749-8524 or stop in during the week and pick up your tickets.
[time=1647] They are free, but you do need a ticket to enter. And it's going to be a very exciting time with about 160 voices joining together to praise the Lord.
[time=1655] We are looking forward to that. Unfortunately, today is Easter for those friends who are watching in South Bend and in Marion because we're delayed by two weeks.
[time=1664] So this invitation is directed to our friends in the Greater Fort Wayne area.
[time=1668] And we certainly do hope that you can join us here on Easter evening for one of the two concerts as we celebrate and we exalt the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1679] We're looking forward to that and we hope that you'll be able to join us here.
[time=1683] Pete, thank you for the hard work and the leadership that goes into that area.
[time=1687] Well, you're welcome and we want to then pass on the thanks to all the people that have worked so hard and arranged their schedule so that they can rehearse the extra rehearsals that we have in preparation for exaltation.
[time=1698] Pete, I am both amazed and thankful for people who are like that. So many people and literally a hundred or more have just made the sacrifice of their time and their energy rearranged everything in their life to be a part of it.
[time=1711] And I'm sure that their reward will be you being there and hearing the praises of our Lord together.
[time=1717] Well, today in our time of Bible study, we're moving through the Sermon on the Mount and particularly the Lord's Prayer.
[time=1724] Last week we looked at Jesus' statement, "Thy kingdom come." This week we're looking at the statement, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[time=1734] That phrase, "Thy will" or "the will of God" is one of the greatest concerns of every believer's life.
[time=1741] If it's not, it should be, that our lives daily are an expression of the will of God.
[time=1746] Many times people have asked the question, "Can I really know God's will for my life?" I believe the answer is an absolute yes.
[time=1754] And we want to share this pamphlet with you called, "Can you know God's will for your life?" It's written by Dr. Charles Smith, a friend from Grace Theological Seminary.
[time=1764] It's not a heavy book.
[time=1766] Whenever you think of a seminary professor, sometimes we think of these deep, dark and often dry truths.
[time=1773] But this is very light, very practical, but most of all very, very biblical.
[time=1778] Giving us insight as to how we can know exactly what God's will is for our life so that we're living our life daily for His purpose and for His pleasure.
[time=1787] You know, the greatest fulfillment we'll know in life is to know and to do God's will.
[time=1792] I'm going to be speaking on that this morning, and I must confess to you that this pamphlet was the most helpful thing I've read on the will of God in many, many years.
[time=1801] And to pick it up this past week and read it again was, "It's great help to me, and I know it will be to you."
[time=1807] So much so, we want you to have a copy as a gift from us to you.
[time=1811] Pete, will you tell our friends how they can receive their copy?
[time=1814] You can receive this pamphlet by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1820] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1823] That's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1830] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1834] We're going to go back to our morning worship service, and Gerald Lynn Davis is going to be singing Brian Lowson, and then we'll be opening the scriptures together.
[time=1869] [MUSIC]
[time=1889] He was bleeding from a beating, there were stripes of arms back,
[time=1896] and he wore a crown of fawns upon his head, and he bore with every step,
[time=1906] the scorn of those who cried out for his death.
[time=1913] Down the field of the Rosa, all the way up the ferry, like the landing of the fire, Christ the King,
[time=1927] and he chose to walk the road out of his love for you and me.
[time=1938] Down the field of the Rosa, all the way to Calvary.
[time=1953] [MUSIC - 61 seconds]
[time=2040] Like a lamb, King of the fire, Christ the King, and he chose to walk the road out of his love for you and me.
[time=2058] Down the field of the Rosa, all the way to Calvary.
[time=2073] [MUSIC]
[time=2102] Would you bow with me in prayer?
[time=2107] Father, we bow before you today, in humility.
[time=2114] Father, we think of the Via de la Rosa, the way of suffering,
[time=2121] the path that Christ took, carrying across the Calvary.
[time=2129] God, our hearts are humbled today, and remorse has taken our mind when we think that it is for our sins that he died,
[time=2139] that he walked that way.
[time=2142] Father, we find ourselves saying trite words like thank you.
[time=2148] Paul said it was an undescribable gift, and God, our feelings today are undescribable of our love for you,
[time=2158] and for your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and this hour we've met to worship him and to praise you,
[time=2164] and to thank you for the cleansing and the forgiveness that we fail and we possess.
[time=2170] Father, we thank you for the joy that you've put within our hearts and a vision for life, and a sense of purpose and meaning to our being.
[time=2180] Father, today we praise you for your great love, for your abounding love, your abounding grace.
[time=2187] Father, we cling to it today for the strength of our life.
[time=2191] Father, we've come to bow before you to surrender our allegiance to you, to say worthy is your Son, the Lamb, to receive glory and honor and praise.
[time=2202] Father, we've come to consecrate ourselves to your service, and yet also to ask for your grace and strength.
[time=2210] Father, today we would pray that you would strengthen our lives by strengthening our commitment to you.
[time=2216] Father, draw us deeper into your word daily.
[time=2220] Father, call us into deeper service.
[time=2225] Father, make the beat of our heart a heart for God.
[time=2230] Lord, we would ask today that the grace that has saved us would strengthen us, and particularly those who are walking alone.
[time=2239] For those who've lost loved ones in recent months and today walk alone.
[time=2245] God, we pray particularly for those who walk alone as parents.
[time=2251] Single parents, those who've suffered divorce or become a widower or widower.
[time=2258] God, the strength that they need can only come from you, and we pray that you would strengthen that single person and that single parent in particular.
[time=2266] Father, we pray that you would strengthen those who are going through physical infirmities for Mary and Judy and Joyce Free.
[time=2275] Pray for Marviesland, Mrs. Vanderfort, as they face surgeries.
[time=2281] God, that you would give wisdom to doctors, but strength to their heart and spirit as well.
[time=2286] Father, the list of people of needs is greater than our own mind can comprehend, and the pain of so many is so great.
[time=2294] Yet God, we trust your grace to be sufficient.
[time=2297] So Father, for each today we'd pray that this hour would not only be a time of worship, but a time of renewal when our faith is strengthened, our walk is made straight, our values are clarified.
[time=2309] Oh God today, teach us through your word, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=2314] [AMEN] If you have your Bible with you today, we invite you to open it to the Gospel according to Matthew
[time=2322] in the sixth chapter.
[time=2324] We're studying through the Sermon on the Mount, and more particularly, the Lord's Prayer.
[time=2329] A prayer that Jesus gave to teach us how to pray.
[time=2333] Not so much what we should repeat when we pray.
[time=2336] He's warned against repetition in prayer.
[time=2338] But as a model, a pattern to give us insight as to what our prayers ought to have as their substance
[time=2344] and direction, priorities and purposes.
[time=2348] So Jesus said, "After this man, or pray ye," Matthew 6'9".
[time=2355] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
[time=2364] on earth, just as it is in heaven.
[time=2367] And give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[time=2377] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=2381] For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[time=2387] [AMEN] This week we come to that unique phrase, "Thy will be done."
[time=2395] On earth, just as it is in heaven, thy will be done.
[time=2401] It speaks of a direction in life, a plan and a purpose for life.
[time=2405] In reading an excellent book this past week, each chapter began with a series of quotes.
[time=2410] One of the quotes caught my eye and immediately caused a chuckle to fill me.
[time=2416] But it was not only humorous, it was too true.
[time=2420] A man was giving three words, three words that you've heard all the time, he just changed the order.
[time=2425] And he said, "This was the direction his company had taken." The words were ready, fire, aim.
[time=2435] Isn't that how we manage a lot of things?
[time=2438] Ready, fire, aim.
[time=2442] We shoot, we expend our time, we expend our resources.
[time=2446] We are out there living life in the fast lane, desperately racing, but we haven't determined the direction just yet.
[time=2454] Ready, fire, aim.
[time=2458] Each Thanksgiving morning, about a half a dozen of us rise up very early,
[time=2464] five thirty, and we load our shotguns for the once a year trip to the backyard.
[time=2471] And we shoot these little clay pigeons, most of them get away too.
[time=2475] But one year, in carrying the box of clay pigeons, we drop the box and many of them got slightly cracked.
[time=2481] And when you'd put them in the machine that threw them, they'd go out and they'd go out into a variety of little pieces.
[time=2487] And that became frustrating, and there I stood, armed with my twenty-gauge shotgun, and I gave the word pull,
[time=2493] and that little lever threw out about twenty little pieces.
[time=2496] And in frustration, I was ready, and I couldn't find anything, so I just fired, aiming at nothing.
[time=2504] Let it never be said that hawks cannot hit the broadside of a barn.
[time=2509] I got it on its broadside.
[time=2512] I blew out the only window in the barn, riddled the shutter, damaged the siding.
[time=2516] It was a direct hit.
[time=2519] Ready, fire, aim.
[time=2523] Too much of a commentary on my life, let alone my shooting.
[time=2529] And you're chuckling in agreement.
[time=2532] I know you, you're not laughing at me, you're laughing with me.
[time=2536] What are we aiming at in life?
[time=2539] There was a man by the name of Abraham Maslow.
[time=2541] Maslow was probably one of the thinkers that shaped Western thought more than anybody else to bring us to the point that we're at today.
[time=2550] He's been called the father of humanistic psychology, and he developed a pyramid.
[time=2555] And at the base of the pyramid were the most basic needs that every person has.
[time=2560] And as you move up the pyramid, you come to the pinnacle, and the pinnacle of human need, and everything that humans strive for, the ultimate, he said, was self-actualization, or self-realization, and in Maslow's own words, he called it the autonomous self.
[time=2577] He said, that is what our life is aiming for.
[time=2580] Self-discovery, self-realization, self-achievement, the autonomous self.
[time=2588] Putting forth our will.
[time=2591] That stands beloved in sharp contrast to what Jesus taught us to pray.
[time=2598] Not self-realization, but God-realization.
[time=2602] Not self-actualization, but God's will being actualized.
[time=2606] Not autonomous, my will, but God's plan.
[time=2611] Reminded of the epic words of the American poet Robert Frost, who said, "Two paths diverged into a woods." And I chose the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
[time=2627] We stand daily at a crossroads, don't we?
[time=2630] And daily we must make decisions.
[time=2632] Which path will we take?
[time=2635] The path that is self-actualizing, or the path that is God, or deigned?
[time=2646] Jesus taught, as one of the central core truths of praying, that our prayer was to be consumed with the notion preoccupied with the thought of God's will.
[time=2660] Notice first of all with me the place of that statement in the Lord's prayer.
[time=2665] First of all, it is placed strategically right after the plea for the kingdom to come.
[time=2670] He said, "Pray this way, thy kingdom come." The kingdom represents God's ultimate purpose in history.
[time=2678] God's ultimate purpose in creation.
[time=2680] God's ultimate purpose in redemption are the kingdom.
[time=2684] And as the first request were to pray that God's kingdom would come, that it would expand and ultimately arrive with a kingdom on earth and God's own king Christ,
[time=2694] thrown and seated on a world that is in loving obedience to him.
[time=2700] And immediately following that request were to pray, "Thy will be done." You know what he's saying there? As we pray for the kingdom to come, the kingdom is going to come in direct proportion to our will being in line with God's will.
[time=2715] Because God's plan for the advancement of the kingdom is through his people advancing the kingdom cause.
[time=2722] And the only way we will advance the kingdom cause is to be flowing in harmony through his will.
[time=2729] He placed it right after the plea for the kingdom so he would see the implications on our own life.
[time=2736] But notice also he placed the statement, "Thy will be done before he put any personal request."
[time=2745] Notice that the prayer so far has been dominated by the second person pronoun, "Thy."
[time=2751] How it would be, "Thy name," "Thy kingdom come," "Thy will be done."
[time=2758] We're yet to discover any request for ours.
[time=2762] The only time the first person pronoun occurs is the privilege that is ours of addressing God as our father.
[time=2769] Other than that, there's been no reference to prayer for self.
[time=2774] It's not until after we submit ourselves to God's will that we then are free to pray, our daily bread, please, Father.
[time=2782] Forgiveness, please. Deliverance.
[time=2787] You know, almost every one of us ends our prayer with the same nine words, if it be thy well in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2794] And we can say it in record time.
[time=2796] Most of us can slur it together, though it's just one big, long word.
[time=2802] I don't think it's really important whether you put that first or last in the verbal communication of a prayer,
[time=2810] but it's got to be first in the attitude of a prayer.
[time=2814] You see, for Jesus, prayer had the will of God as preeminent, and we have it as a postscript.
[time=2826] Oh, by the way, God, your will can be done in all this, too, if it works out.
[time=2832] I mean, God, after you get these things done, man, if your will can fit into that, that'd be fantastic.
[time=2840] Jesus said it's preeminent.
[time=2843] We say it's a postscript, P.S., God.
[time=2846] Anything you want today?
[time=2849] Jesus saw the will of God as a filter, and every request that we give goes through that filter, it must pass that test.
[time=2859] And if it doesn't go through the filler of the word of God, it's no longer valid.
[time=2865] We don't see it as a filter, we see it as a frustration.
[time=2868] Let's be honest, there's a spiritual phobia of the will of God, isn't there?
[time=2873] Almost every one of us, when we hear of the will of God, we suddenly see ourselves in the deep, darkest jungle of Africa with all these little varmints about to eat us.
[time=2883] And we're going to go tell somebody about Christ.
[time=2886] That may be in God's will for one or two of us, but we've got this phobia that it's going to somehow be a frustration to everything we want.
[time=2896] Jesus never saw God's will as a frustration, he saw it as the filter through which everything that he ever asked God had to pass.
[time=2905] Not only that, Jesus saw the will of God as the very reference point for its life.
[time=2913] We see it as a checking off point.
[time=2916] That's why Jesus put it in the place of priority before any request because it's to be the very reference point for our lives.
[time=2927] Notice not only the place that Jesus put it, but notice the purpose.
[time=2932] He said, "Pray thy will be done on earth just as it is in heaven." You know, God's will is a very difficult thing to get a grasp on.
[time=2942] I think it's best understood in two terms that Dr. Charles Smith used to describe it.
[time=2947] He said, "There are two dimensions to God's will.
[time=2950] There's the determined will of God that is going to happen no matter what anyone does, no matter what powers, earthly or spiritual posing.
[time=2959] God's determined will is going to come about." There's another dimension to God's will that's not determined, it's simply what God desires.
[time=2967] He desires it in an intense and in great way, but this will of God is left to the choice of his creation.
[time=2974] This will of God, he leaves to no choice other than his own.
[time=2979] In Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11, the Apostle Paul wrote about the determined will of God.
[time=2986] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 11.
[time=2991] Paul writes, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated," one of our favorite words,
[time=3000] "being predestinated according," now notice these last phrases, "according to the purpose of him who works all things after the council, the plan of his own will."
[time=3020] In other words, God is predestined, pro-aridzo, which means he set the boundaries.
[time=3025] He's fenced in the yard and he has determined what's going to happen so that that whole thing is moving after his own plan.
[time=3033] Now within the fence, God's created choice.
[time=3039] You see, the religious leaders of the day had a choice.
[time=3042] They could have freed Christ or they could have crucified him.
[time=3046] But their choice fit perfectly and with the determined counsel of God who determined that Christ should die for our sins.
[time=3054] Now you see in heaven, the only thing that's being worked out right now is the determined will of God.
[time=3061] Since the original fall of Satan, all the rebellious angels were cast out and they were confirmed in sin and the other angels were confirmed in righteousness.
[time=3070] In heaven, the determined will of God is being worked out. There's no sin, there's no rebellion, there's no passive ignoring of God, it's the determined will of God.
[time=3079] Here on earth, God's determined will is also blended with God's desires and God has not forced his desire.
[time=3089] You see, the Bible says it's God's desire, it is God's will that none should perish but that all should come to repentance.
[time=3097] But the tragic truth is God's desire is not going to be fulfilled because not all are going to come to repentance because he's left that desire as a choice that you and I must respond to.
[time=3110] You see, when Jesus said when we pray, the purpose of prayer is to pray that our desires fall into harmony with God's desires
[time=3121] so that what God desires is what we desire and what happens here on earth is the very desire of the heartbeat of God.
[time=3128] You see, the purpose of prayer is not so much to change God's mind but to change our mind.
[time=3139] You know, I come to God and I think the purpose of prayer is for me to solicit from God but the real purpose of prayer is for me to submit to God.
[time=3151] You see, when we pray, we're not primarily bringing God's will into harmony with ours but bringing our will into harmony with his.
[time=3164] It should change our desires, it should change our outlooks.
[time=3168] We should go through the same agonizing experience that Jesus did when he came with his desire to the Garden of Gethsemane.
[time=3175] He said, "God, I know in my human feelings I don't want this."
[time=3181] He described his suffering as a cup that was full and he said, "God, my earthly desire is that this cup passes from me but God, I'm coming to you in prayer so that your will will be done."
[time=3193] Not mine.
[time=3195] And the result of that prayer was not the changing of the circumstances.
[time=3201] It was a change, if it's fair to say, in Christ that he went willingly to the cross.
[time=3210] It's often been said that prayer changes things, that's true, but more often prayer doesn't change things, it changes people.
[time=3219] Here am I and around me are all these things that I don't like, they make me uncomfortable, they're painful, they're difficult, and I pray and I say, "God, change these things."
[time=3229] You know what God usually does when we pray that way? He doesn't change one of them, he changes us.
[time=3236] You see, prayer is not so much to lessen pressure as it is to build perseverance.
[time=3246] Jesus said, "Pray after this manner, pray God, your kingdom, your ultimate plan in creation, redemption and history, God let it come, and God use me."
[time=3261] Whatever your will is, God bring my life into harmony with your will.
[time=3269] It's amazing that David said, "Commit by way under the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart."
[time=3279] You know what David was saying there? If we commit our way, our will to His will, and we begin to live out His will, our heart is going to begin to desire things.
[time=3287] You know what it's going to desire? The things that God desires.
[time=3292] What a freeing, liberating spirit that is.
[time=3299] Today is that statement, "Thy will be done, preeminent in our praying, or as a postscript at the end of our prayer."
[time=3314] Two words, "Thy will, thy will, stand antithetical to everything that we feel instinctively as a human, because we're caught up in my will, my will."
[time=3336] And so there are the two paths that are placed in front of us. "Will you choose the one that is less traveled by, thy will, or will you choose the one that is the most traveled by, my will?"
[time=3353] For some of us today, that means an initial surrender to Christ as Savior. If you've never given your heart to Him, that's where the will of God begins for your life.
[time=3363] The Bible says, "But to as many as who do receive Him, to them who gave the power to become the children of God, to those that believe on His name, to those who are born not of the will of man, but of the will of God."
[time=3375] It is God's will that you're born again in Him and that you receive Christ. For some of you, you need to make that decision today.
[time=3383] For others of you to say God thy will is going to mean a re-altering of your life's priorities. Some of you, your business values, your business ethics, your philosophy of management is going to have to change radically if you're going to have God's will in your life.
[time=3399] For others of us, the use of our time is going to have to go through a complete metamorphosis because everything that we do has been referenced with my will.
[time=3411] And God's will has been excluded. For others of us, it's an area of financial integrity and responsibility to pray my will.
[time=3420] I don't know where it is for your life, but I'm facing it daily in mind. And I'm finding the greatest joy in life is not to run, but to face it, and to surrender to the will of God.
[time=3431] Prayer is not so much for us to solicit from God as to surrender to Him. Would you surrender to Him today? I pray that you will.
