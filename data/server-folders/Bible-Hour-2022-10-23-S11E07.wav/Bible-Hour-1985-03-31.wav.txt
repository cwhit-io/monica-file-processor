[time=20] There's too much for that.
[time=26] [MUSIC - 19 seconds]
[time=69] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=73] From the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=80] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choirs, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=90] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=94] [MUSIC]
[time=118] There's four together, when I shout.
[time=123] [MUSIC]
[time=146] As though I've stayed here, I'll break down.
[time=155] I'll break down.
[time=159] There's been twice more, I'll stay here, I'll be here.
[time=166] [MUSIC]
[time=181] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=185] A few moments ago, we had the privilege of welcoming those of you who are here with us in this auditorium to our morning worship service.
[time=193] And now we have the privilege of saying a word of welcome to our friends who join us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=199] Both in this auditorium and through television, the very purpose of our worship today
[time=205] is to assign praise and glory and honor to the Lord Jesus Christ and to God the Father Almighty.
[time=212] He is a great God, He is worthy of praise and worthy of glory.
[time=217] Great is the Lord.
[time=219] Today our choir leads us off and a great anthem of praise, and then we'll have opportunity to sing with them that majestic hymn of praise.
[time=227] Great is the Lord.
[time=230] [MUSIC]
[time=241] Great is the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=248] Great is the Lord, He is faithful and true.
[time=254] Ties mercy deep through Jesus.
[time=258] Great is the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=276] Great is the Lord.
[time=285] [MUSIC]
[time=290] Great is the Lord, He is holy and just because He is born.
[time=299] [MUSIC]
[time=305] Great is the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=320] Great is the Lord.
[time=330] Great is the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=386] [MUSIC]
[time=391] In times past the congregation and the choir were as one and they sang great anthems such as this one.
[time=397] This is our opportunity this morning along with the recorded orchestra to sing this song again.
[time=402] The words are on the back of your bulletin. We'll have the introduction by the orchestra and that I want you to join the choir and sing this great anthem.
[time=410] Great is the Lord. Join in if you know nothing else than to say great is the Lord.
[time=415] Shout it out when we get to that spot.
[time=420] [MUSIC]
[time=427] Great is the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=554] Great are the Lord.
[time=563] Great are the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=574] Amen. Thank you for participating.
[time=577] I trust that those words blessed your soul as you sang.
[time=581] Great is the Lord, Jehovah.
[time=583] Let's listen now to Scott Schindler on the piano as he plays a medley of songs that speak of the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord.

[time=880] [APPLAUSE]
[time=893] Again, Pete and I want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. For us today is Palm Sunday,
[time=900] but this videotape won't be played in your area until a week after Easter. So we're trusting that you had a joyful Easter
[time=908] and God used that time of remembering the Lord's death and resurrection as a spiritual challenge and reference point in your life.
[time=916] Pete, this is a busy time where a week away from the work of the musical for you.
[time=921] Yes, but we're praising the Lord that we have the opportunity to sing songs that signify the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[time=928] and we praise the Lord that we have that opportunity.
[time=930] You know, we often think of Easter as the morning that we celebrate the resurrection of Christ, but actually every Sunday morning is a celebration of the resurrection.
[time=940] It's the very reason that we live is because he lives. And the early church changed from the Hebrew tradition of a Saturday night worship
[time=948] to a Sunday morning worship because that is the Lord's day, the day that he arose.
[time=954] Well, we're looking forward to the work of the musical coming next Sunday night for us here in Fort Wayne.
[time=959] The exaltation and the combination of the Marian choir with our choir is going to be a great evening of worship and praise to the Lord through song.
[time=967] Now, Pete, one of the things we should mention for our friends who are watching in Marian is that the choir of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=975] will be joining the choir of the Sunnycrest Baptist Church down in Marian for a Sunday evening concert.
[time=981] That's right, Rick. We'll be in Marian on the 21st of April and we'll be giving a concert at 5 o'clock and at 730 at the Sunnycrest Baptist Church in Marian.
[time=992] Well, that will be an opportunity for our friends in Marian who are watching by way of cable to hear both our choir and the choir of the Sunnycrest Baptist Church.
[time=1001] And again, the dates and the time, please.
[time=1003] April 21st at 5 o'clock and 730 p.m. at the Sunnycrest Baptist Church.
[time=1009] Thank you, Pete. You know, one of the questions I am asked more often than most is the question, "How can I know what God's will is for my life?"
[time=1018] That comes often from the college age person who is trying to plan their career or maybe trying to plan their marriage.
[time=1026] Is this person or is this program God's will for my life and how can I know his will?
[time=1032] Well, today we want to offer you a very helpful little booklet called "Can I Know God's Will for My Life?"
[time=1038] It's written by Dr. Charles Smith and Dr. Smith is a very capable professor at Grace Theological Seminary.
[time=1047] But he's also a very practical, down-to-earth individual in his thinking.
[time=1053] And in this booklet, he searches the scriptures and gives us some of the key insights as to what is God's desire, what is God determined,
[time=1061] and what does God's will for my life mean, and how can I best know it, how can I serve him, and how can I be, as Paul said,
[time=1068] proving what is the good and the perfect and acceptable will of God.
[time=1072] Well, there's many, many fine books and pamphlets on this subject, and I want to encourage you to read as much as you can.
[time=1079] But I believe this pamphlet by Dr. Smith is one of the best, if not the very best, and we want to send it to you free.
[time=1087] Simply by writing and asking for it, we'll give you a copy, and we want to encourage you to write to us today and request your copy of a pamphlet on the will of God.
[time=1098] All that you need to do is write to us and ask for the pamphlet on the will of God, and we'll send it to you.
[time=1104] Pete, will you share how they can do that?
[time=1106] Rick, they can receive the pamphlet by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1116] That's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1123] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us.
[time=1126] As we go back to the live part of our morning worship service, we're going to be hearing a special song that's taken right out of the scriptures from John 3 16
[time=1135] and Pete and Brian Lawson are going to sing that song for us, and then we'll be studying the requests of the Lord's Prayer.
[time=1142] You know that today we have access to God in prayer because of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1148] We've come to worship Him. Thank you for joining us.
[time=1165] God loves the world so much He gave His only Son.
[time=1174] God loves the Jesus Christ, His work on earth is done.
[time=1182] God loves the world which means that He loves even me.
[time=1192] And by His love He sets my soul at liberty.
[time=1203] God loves and how could I not love Him in return?
[time=1212] God loves and how He loves my spirit longs to learn.
[time=1221] God loves and so do Him my love I freely give.
[time=1231] In what I think, in what I do, in how I live.
[time=1248] God loves and thousands way to hear the blessed news.
[time=1257] God loves and now my time and talent He would use.
[time=1265] God loves this witness to the lost my life would bear.
[time=1276] That by His love through me they do may know His care.
[time=1290] God loves God loves.
[time=1312] Thank you men. The fact that God loves us is the very reference point of our hope.
[time=1319] Our God and our Father today we've come to worship you and to thank you for your love.
[time=1327] Father we stand in amazement in awe of the fact that you the God of the universe would care about the very details of our life.
[time=1339] Father we thank you that your Word says that you know us are going forth and are sitting down.
[time=1345] You know the details of our body to the number of hairs that cover our head.
[time=1350] Lord thank you for knowing and caring about us.
[time=1353] God we would ask that your spirit would help each person here to understand the depth of your love not just for this world but for them as an individual.
[time=1362] Father today it is through the access that your Son Jesus has made that we come to you with our hearts wide open.
[time=1370] Father we pray that your Word today would be a word of instruction for each of our lives that we might order our steps to please you.
[time=1380] God we would pray today that your Word would be a word of correction.
[time=1386] For each one who is walking in disobedience God may your Word and your spirit shed light in their hearts that they see their need for correction.
[time=1396] Father we pray today that your Word would be a word of encouragement to the one whose burden is so great.
[time=1403] Father we pray for those today who have had fractured relationships in their family.
[time=1409] For mothers and daughters for fathers and sons.
[time=1413] For families who have been torn apart God may you give words of healing and direction to each heart.
[time=1420] Father we pray today for those who have deteriorated that you might put a hand of healing upon them and give insight into each party as to how they might please you.
[time=1433] Father we would pray today for those who are in physical need.
[time=1439] We thank you for those who are on the road to recovery.
[time=1443] God we pray for those today who need have come up urgently and suddenly for Linda and Sue, for Carolyn.
[time=1452] God may you minister to them at their point of need today.
[time=1456] We pray for those whose hearts have been broken.
[time=1460] God today we would ask you to comfort the stable family.
[time=1464] Father we would pray for those who battle cancer.
[time=1470] For Virginia, Vanderfort and Mary Lantman and Harry Bennett and Joyce Free and a multitude of others.
[time=1477] God we would ask you to give comfort to them.
[time=1480] Father put within our hearts we pray through your Word today a spirit of expectation.
[time=1486] An expectation that in Jesus Christ we have deliverance and we have grace to bear it.
[time=1491] Father thank you for the courage that comes to our heart through your Word.
[time=1496] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=1501] As a seminary student there were a number of books that were required reading.
[time=1506] Augustine's Confession, Bonhoeffer's Ethics, Strong's Theology and then along the way I picked up this book that was not required reading.
[time=1517] It's called Children's Letters to God.
[time=1520] Stories of little letters that children have written finally came across a theological piece that I could understand.
[time=1527] And in it I have found some of the greatest insights into our humanness and God's greatness.
[time=1534] I'm not sure that this letter has anything to do with today's message but it has a lot to do with spring break.
[time=1540] Dear God, we're going on vacation for two weeks.
[time=1544] We'll be back Friday, F-R-I-E-D-A-Y.
[time=1549] So we won't be in church.
[time=1551] I hope you'll be there when we get back.
[time=1554] By the way, when do you take your vacation?
[time=1558] Goodbye, Donnie.
[time=1561] Here's one that is more like the subject of today, prayer, and too close to being like my prayers to be comfortable.
[time=1570] Dear God, in all capitals, I would like these things, A, a new bike, B, a number three chemistry set, C, a dog.
[time=1587] Don't you wonder how God handles it when the mother prays there is no dog?
[time=1591] D, a movie camera, E, a first baseman glove.
[time=1597] If I can't have all of them, I would like to have most of them.
[time=1603] Yours truly Eric.
[time=1605] But here's his insurance policy.
[time=1607] P.S. I know there's no Santa Claus.
[time=1611] God, I know that it was going to come.
[time=1614] It better be from you because there's no Santa Claus.
[time=1618] That's somewhat of the ABCs of the prayer life that most of us, including myself, too often demonstrate.
[time=1624] God, here's what I'd like, and if I can't have all of them, I can negotiate as long as I get most of them.
[time=1634] Open your Bibles, if you will, to Matthew the sixth chapter, where Matthew records in the Sermon on the Mount what you and I have come to know as the Lord's Prayer.
[time=1644] Not so much a prayer that's given for us to repeat, as much as it is a model telling us in what ways to pray.
[time=1653] Jesus said in verse 9, "After this manner, therefore, pray ye.
[time=1659] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
[time=1674] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=1689] For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
[time=1699] For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[time=1706] But if you forgive not men their trespasses, then neither will your Heavenly Father forgive you.
[time=1716] Prayer. Last week we talked about the primary purpose of prayer, that it is not so much an opportunity for us to solicit from God, but as much to submit to God.
[time=1734] Prayer is not so much a matter of talking to God so as to change his mind as it is to learn from God what his mind is, and to change our minds.
[time=1745] There is a rather clear and pronounced changing of pronouns in the Lord's Prayer, isn't there?
[time=1751] At first the predominant pronoun is that little word thy, a second person pronoun, that is the prayer makes his request known unto God.
[time=1762] The direction of his request is towards God, the other person.
[time=1767] It begins by saying, the very first request, hallowed be thy name.
[time=1775] God, may your character, may your name be hallowed, may it be holy, may it be sent apart, may it be special, may the very character of God remain in its dignity and its transcendence.
[time=1786] May we never look at you with a tried eye, or speak of you with a simple word.
[time=1792] God, may your character be honored above everything else, thy name.
[time=1798] Then there was the statement, thy kingdom come.
[time=1802] God, may your plan for history be brought to culmination.
[time=1806] All that God has purposed in creation and in redemption, may it roll into the pages of history with the great kingdom of God.
[time=1814] God, may it come, not my kingdom, not my dynasty, but yours, oh God, may it come.
[time=1824] Thy will be done.
[time=1826] God, not my plans, not my ambitions, not my goals, but God your very design, not only in the history of the kingdom, but in my life personally your will.
[time=1836] God, may I know it today, and may I live it out.
[time=1846] The priority of prayer is referenced in the person of God as the very center, the very nucleus of prayer, and that our lives are to be energized moving like an electrode around the very purpose of God at the core of our being.
[time=1860] And so with those priorities, we arrange our life to please him and to honor him for we were made not for ourselves but for his glory.
[time=1872] It was Pascal who said, God has shaped us and he has shaped us with a vacuum within that can only be filled by himself.
[time=1884] And you and I will never know the fulfillment of life until we are fulfilled in him.
[time=1892] But based on that priority of making him our reference point, there comes not only those priorities but there comes privileges.
[time=1899] With a change of pronoun, now we enter into a different dimension of prayer that which is of our own privilege of requesting in him.
[time=1908] Notice the next three phrases change from thy to us.
[time=1914] Give us this day our daily bread.
[time=1920] Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[time=1926] Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
[time=1933] Now the reference point having been established in the person of God has moved to the very needs of our lives.
[time=1942] If you like simple little outlines, I believe that these three requests give us the fact that God is willing to provide help for our bodies, help for our souls, and help for our spirit.
[time=1954] Dr. D. Martin Lloyd-Jones, one of the great English preachers of times past, has written these words on this section of the Lord's Prayer.
[time=1964] Our whole life is found in these petitions.
[time=1968] The whole life of the believer in every respect, our physical needs, our mental needs, and our spirit needs.
[time=1975] The body is remembered, the soul is remembered, and the spirit is remembered, and that is the whole of the person.
[time=1986] In this area of the privilege of praying, God is remembered, there is need for our body, there is need for our spirit, and there is need for our soul.
[time=1997] And all of that has been made possible through the very beginning statement that we can pray our Father.
[time=2005] For you see it's not until we come into a Father, Son, our Father, Daughter relationship with God that we can even begin to pray the Lord's Prayer or any other prayer because we are sealed off from God.
[time=2021] We have no access to God, but through the Lord Jesus Christ access has been granted.
[time=2030] Turn back in your Bible just for a moment to Ephesians the third chapter, and in Ephesians the second chapter, the Apostle Paul beautifully outlines the fact of the nature of humanity as being estranged, alienated, separated from God,
[time=2048] but brings forth the truth that in Jesus Christ we have access with God.
[time=2055] Chapter 2 verse 18, "For through him Christ Jesus we have both access by one spirit under the Father."
[time=2068] Chapter 3 verse 12, "In whom we have the boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him."
[time=2079] Through him the Lord Jesus Christ we now have access to the Father.
[time=2085] All of humanity was estranged from God. It's as though God were on this mountain and man on this other mountain separated by an encrossable chasm that no bridge could span.
[time=2098] No good deeds that we could do, no gifts that we could give, no worship that we could ascribe could ever bridge that gap because the very demand of God was more opurity and perfection.
[time=2111] And so no matter how feeble our noble our temps may be, they fell short of the necessity of a perfect bridge until the Lord Jesus Christ would lay down his life and create a bridge and thereby create access to God.
[time=2128] Written with the reference point of the Jewish mind, the author of Hebrews says these words in chapter 10 in verse 19.
[time=2136] Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
[time=2144] Within the temple there were different areas of access that different groups were allowed and then there was the holiest area called the Holy of Holies and their access was limited.
[time=2155] Only one man could enter the high priest and that man only on one appointed day there was no access to God.
[time=2163] But now we enter into the most intimate relationship with God by a new and living way which he have consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God.
[time=2178] Let us draw near with true heart and full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=2188] And let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised.
[time=2194] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more.
[time=2207] As you see the day approaching not forsaking our assembling together why have we assembled today because we've come together not only for access to fellowship but to access to God through the Lord Jesus Christ you can know him today.
[time=2223] Many of us would find ourselves stunned in awe if we were to have received in the mail a personal not a form letter word process but a personal handwritten note from the President of the United States inviting us to come to the White House.
[time=2243] Anytime we wanted just walk into the Oval Office I'm there for you and I'd love to see you any day. You can't come too often.
[time=2253] We'd be amazed. We would think what a privilege.
[time=2259] But do you realize that one who totally dwarfs the presidency of the United States as noble as office that is invites us to have access into his Oval Office, into his whole hip, whole ace.
[time=2274] Vance Havener said when Mr. Carter was President that compared to access to God access to the presidency is just peanuts.
[time=2285] You know, it really is.
[time=2288] There is nothing that can begin to comprehend the fact that you and I have access to God today through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2298] He is our access. He is our bridge.
[time=2301] He is our mediator. He is our way, our truth and our life.
[time=2305] He is our gate and our good shepherd.
[time=2307] He is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and all of history comes together in him and you and him can come to God.
[time=2316] We have access to the Father.
[time=2319] That gives us the privilege of praying.
[time=2322] Matthew tells us in the Lord's prayer that we first can come to him with prayer requests, the privilege of praying for help for our bodies today.
[time=2331] Jesus said, "Give us this day our daily bread." Bread was not meant to describe simply that which we slice.
[time=2341] Bread is a euphemism here to describe every material need that we have.
[time=2346] Martin Luther writing in the 16th century said this.
[time=2350] Bread is a symbol for everything necessary for the preservation of life.
[time=2355] Like food, a healthy body, good weather, home, wife, children, good government and peace.
[time=2361] Bread was Jesus' way of saying we can pray to God for everything.
[time=2367] God wasn't limiting our prayer here to just the very basics of life that we can only pray for food.
[time=2373] Don't dare pray for meat.
[time=2377] Don't pray for a home. Don't pray for health. Don't pray for transportation.
[time=2381] Jesus wasn't narrowing the focus down to actual, sub-living existence.
[time=2388] Bread was a way of describing the very basic portion of life.
[time=2392] Whatever you have need of physically for the body, Jesus says you can pray for.
[time=2398] You can pray for it.
[time=2401] And he says, "You can come to God with the very physical needs of your body." It's referenced in his will.
[time=2409] I wish that his will was as the false teachers of our day are so boldly declaring,
[time=2415] but his will is not as they say.
[time=2417] It is not God's will that each of us experience good health and great wealth.
[time=2425] If that was God's will, then why did Paul suffer with a thorn in the flesh?
[time=2433] Why did the puzzle, Paul, say, "I've learned how to be content whether I am a based or a bound"?
[time=2439] Why did he have seasons of abasement if it was God's will that everyone have great wealth and good health?
[time=2451] You see, we submit ourselves to the will of God and within that will of God allowing him to use us as his vessels.
[time=2459] However he chooses there is the privilege of God knowing our heart through prayer.
[time=2467] He invites us to pray for the needs of our bodies represented in that word bread.
[time=2474] But there's also an adjective that is given there that describes bread.
[time=2478] It is the little word daily.
[time=2480] As I've meditated on why he would use the word daily, it seems an inexhaustible reasons are available.
[time=2489] Let me suggest just these three.
[time=2492] The word daily reminds me of my need to recognize my total dependence upon God.
[time=2500] I don't know how the tradition began that you pray before you eat food.
[time=2506] I'm not knocking the tradition at all.
[time=2509] I don't know why we pray before we eat and we don't pray before we drive.
[time=2513] It's probably the most dangerous of the two.
[time=2517] You wouldn't think of sitting down with three or four Christians at a table and saying, "Let's just scarf it down." We always pray.
[time=2527] But why aren't we so geared up every time we get in the automobile to pray?
[time=2533] The way I drive you better.
[time=2536] The way my wife drives you better start praying now.
[time=2541] Why is it the word like that?
[time=2542] We categories.
[time=2543] You've got to pray for this, but you don't have to pray for that.
[time=2547] It's a little bit inconsistent.
[time=2550] But at least praying before our meals is a recognition of the fact that we are saying,
[time=2556] "God, I am totally dependent upon you." There isn't anything that I have in and of myself.
[time=2564] Nothing.
[time=2565] Not even the food that I eat.
[time=2568] One of the dangers of a fluency is it makes us self-dependent, self-sufficient,
[time=2575] and we become self-deceived.
[time=2579] We think we've earned it all.
[time=2581] Why do I have all that I possess?
[time=2583] Well, it's some hard work on my part and some basic wisdom and investment and good planning
[time=2589] and strategy, and I've basically done this because I'm such a wonderful person.
[time=2594] Oh, no.
[time=2595] All that we have is a gift of God.
[time=2598] The prophet said, "It is the Lord that gives the strength to get wealth."
[time=2604] In the book of Deuteronomy, the eighth chapter, Moses, by the Spirit of God, reminds the children of Israel of this key principle.
[time=2613] Deuteronomy 8, verse 11, "God gives this word of warning." Both to them and by analogy to us.
[time=2621] Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his commandments and his ordinance
[time=2629] and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
[time=2632] Beware, don't forget the Lord thy God.
[time=2635] Last one thou hast eaten and artful and hast built goodly houses and dwell therein,
[time=2644] and when thy herds and my flocks be multiplied, and my silver and my gold are multiplied,
[time=2650] and everything that you have is multiplied that thy heart be lifted up.
[time=2657] And thou forget the Lord thy God who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, through drought where there was no water,
[time=2673] who brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint, who led thee in the wilderness with manna,
[time=2679] which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee and that he might test thee
[time=2687] to do thee good at the latter end, and after all this has happened, and thou shall stay in thine heart, my power and my might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
[time=2707] Oh, there's such a dangerous problem that prosperity brings us.
[time=2713] It is the deception that we are self-reliant, and all that we have comes of our own strength.
[time=2722] Daily prayer helps us to recognize that we are daily dependent upon God.
[time=2730] It is daily. Remember this. Everything that we possess can be taken away in a moment.
[time=2739] Our friends in Ohio learned of the potential of that.
[time=2743] As in a moment, the savings and loans of the state of Ohio were closed, an uncertainty gloomed over as a heavy cloud in 1840 in the panic, and in 1870 in another panic. In 1929, as a stock market would crash,
[time=2760] prosperity ended in a moment. Everything that we possess can be gone in a moment.
[time=2767] We need to recognize our daily dependence upon God.
[time=2771] I think you also use the word daily to restrain greediness.
[time=2778] Notice that we can come to God, and we can't ask him for our daily needs, but beloved, I'm not certain that we can come to God with an exhaustive list of once desires and appetites.
[time=2788] For tomorrow and tomorrow's tomorrow, that we can forever say of God, give me more, give me more, give me more. God add to my abundance much.
[time=2799] Oh, we may choose to do that and praise his name for the generosity of his blessing,
[time=2805] but I also believe that prayer is also designed not only to get from God, but to restrain our greediness. How much is enough? Just a little bit more.
[time=2818] Just a little bit more. Finally, I believe daily was given to remind us
[time=2824] that we're to seek his kingdom first. Remember what Jesus said, but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[time=2833] Then, secondarily, all of these things shall be added unto you.
[time=2840] Take no thought for the moral for sufficient in the day as the evil thereof.
[time=2846] By praying daily for today's needs is a reminder not to worry about tomorrow, but to simply focus our attention on the kingdom of God.
[time=2856] The Bible invites us here to pray for our physical needs, but then it also allows us to pray not only for help for the body, but help for the soul, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[time=2870] Do you know that forgiveness is as necessary to the soul as bread is to the body?
[time=2876] It's essential. John R.W. Stott quotes the head of an English mental institution as saying this,
[time=2886] "I could dismiss over half of my patients today if they could but be assured of forgiveness."
[time=2901] If they could but be assured of forgiveness, one of the most basic needs of our soul.
[time=2908] And by the word soul, I'm referring to our personality that is often divided in three ways between mind, emotion, and will.
[time=2917] That inner person that is the true you, one of the greatest needs we have is the no forgiveness.
[time=2925] You see, lack of forgiveness leads to the growth of guilt and broken relationships.
[time=2933] If I have in a biblical word trust passed against you, then I'm going to suffer two consequences.
[time=2940] The first is guilt, and the second is a broken relationship with you.
[time=2945] It is now estranged. It is marred. It is broken.
[time=2951] And psychology teaches us very clearly that guilt and broken relationships develop within us a sense of frustration within our own soul
[time=2962] that leads us immobile and stagnant and paralyzed.
[time=2966] That motivation is gone, that purpose is deteriorating and that we are less stagnant.
[time=2973] And our soul begins to die within us. And there's only one cure, forgiveness.
[time=2982] Each of us desperately needs to know forgiveness.
[time=2987] And here the Bible says that Jesus invites us to pray openly for forgiveness.
[time=2996] That word forgiveness has a multitude of meanings, perhaps the best analogy is the fact of a canceled debt.
[time=3003] That's exactly what the word can often be used to mean, to cancel a debt.
[time=3009] That you and your generosity look at me who owes you money.
[time=3013] And it's very clear that there is a bill dude, but out of your love you write on it, pay it in full, canceled, even though I didn't pay it in full.
[time=3022] It's forgiven, it is gone, it is canceled.
[time=3026] God says I stand ready to forgive, to cancel your debts, and to wipe your slate clean.
[time=3035] Clean.
[time=3037] Guild free. Relationships restored. Jesus Christ has done that.
[time=3045] But yet there's another need that we have that is not only a need, it is a responsibility.
[time=3050] Not only the need to be forgiven, but we also have the need and responsibility to be forgiveness.
[time=3059] Do you know if we truly use the Lord's prayer as our model in praying most of us, probably have a very broken, marred, estranged relationship with God?
[time=3069] Because there is a little modifying conjunction there, the little word ass.
[time=3075] The prayer says God forgive me as in the same manner as I am forgiving others.
[time=3082] Do you know what that is saying? If we have sinned against God over here, and our brother has sinned against us over there, if we do not forgive him, God is not going to forgive us.
[time=3095] Jesus found this point to be so pertinent that he repeated it, expanded it at the very end of the Lord's prayer.
[time=3104] Verses 14 and 15. Conditional statement. If you forgive men, then God will forgive you.
[time=3112] Conversely, if you do not forgive men, God will not forgive you.
[time=3118] Do you know that it is entirely possible today that there is a register of unforgiven sins on our account that is built up a wall between you, or me, and God?
[time=3133] You are saying, "Wait a minute, Hawks, do you mean that if I have asked Christ to forgive me of my sins, if he has come into my heart, and I have been born again, and I have walked with God, and now if I have not forgiven this individual, that I have lost my salvation, that I will be forever estranged from God, that is not at all what this is teaching."
[time=3154] What this is teaching is not in your position of salvation, but in your position of relationship with God.
[time=3161] You see, once you are born again into the family of God, you become his child, his son, or his daughter, and nothing will ever change that.
[time=3171] I have three children. No matter what happens, if they grow up and honor me or if they grow up and shame me, if they love me or despise me, if they receive me or they reject me, whether they do me harm or do me good forever, they are my children, and nothing can ever change that.
[time=3190] But a number of things can become a barrier in our relationship.
[time=3202] You, if you have received Christ by faith, have him in your heart, in your his son, or his daughter, and nothing will ever change that position.
[time=3212] But if we have sin in our life, God says if we confess it, his faith won't just forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness, but now Jesus is warning us, God is only going to do that in the same way as we demonstrate that forgiveness and how we deal with others.
[time=3232] Christ gave a magnificent parable of the two debtors, one man who owed his master more than he could ever pay in a lifetime, and his master forgave it.
[time=3243] But then the forgiven man went back out in the community, found a man who owed him a pittance in comparison, and began to demand of him full and complete payment with threats of imprisonment.
[time=3259] And then the master who had forgiven the debt was angered, because he had forgiven so much, and this man was to forgive, but he forgave nothing, and it was so little.
[time=3272] In comparison to what God has forgiven us, it is so much that any trespass that happens to us is relatively small, and we are to forgive.
[time=3284] You not only need to forgive for the repair in your prayer life and the repair in your relationship to that person, but there is only one other option to forgiveness, and that is bitterness.
[time=3294] And that will strike you, not the party that hurts you, but you, and bitterness will consume your soul and rob you of your joy, zap you of your strength, and render you a spiritual weakling.
[time=3308] But forgiveness can restore your relationship to God, and re-enact a fellowship with him and a passageway by which your access is restored.
[time=3321] Forgiveness, the needs of the soul.
[time=3324] Finally, Jesus said we can also pray for the needs of the Spirit.
[time=3329] He prayed, "Lead us not into temptation." Does that mean God leads into temptation, that God solicits and baits with evil? No, he does not.
[time=3339] The scripture says, "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man."
[time=3347] God does not tempt you with evil, but God does test you, and the word tempt or test really come from the same root.
[time=3354] Temptation is solicitation to evil, testing is straining us for good, and God does strain us, but there even comes a time when we say God in that testing, deliver me, and God delivers.
[time=3366] Either delivers by removing the test or providing the strength and the grace to bear it.
[time=3372] And then he also recognizes that the adversary, the evil, the evil one, is there.
[time=3378] How do we overcome the evil one? How are we delivered from it?
[time=3382] We are delivered by two simple steps as James chapter 4.
[time=3386] Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
[time=3389] Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you.
[time=3392] Very simple, but very effective.
[time=3394] Resist Satan.
[time=3396] Resist him at the first sign of temptation.
[time=3398] Move out on the first alarm.
[time=3400] Resist him at the very thought level.
[time=3402] Resist him at his temptation of enticement and solicitation.
[time=3406] Resist him at every point.
[time=3409] And not only do that as a negative step, but as a positive step, draw near to God.
[time=3414] Draw near to him through word, through prayer, through fellowship, through witnessing, through service, draw near to God.
[time=3421] You'll find victory and deliverance.
[time=3424] And the prayer for the Spirit, along with the prayer for the soul, along with the prayer for the body.
[time=3430] And each of those privileges are available to you and to me today through access through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3438] Through being able to call him Father, and we can only do that if we receive him by faith into our hearts.
[time=3444] And we're born again into his family.
[time=3446] Have you been born again?
[time=3448] If not this very moment, you can open up your heart to Christ and be born again and adopted into the family of God.
[time=3457] I pray that you'll do that.
