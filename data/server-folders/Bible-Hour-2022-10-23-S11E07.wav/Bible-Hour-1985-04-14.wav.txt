[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=64] Now, live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=72] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups, and soloists, and a message from God's Word, we'll be right back to you next week.
[time=83] We'll be right back in the morning.
[time=85] We'll be right back to you next week.
[time=616] I learned much those three years as I worked at the Christian school.
[time=621] I learned about what it was like to be able to apply the word every day in every situation
[time=627] in the classroom, and I knew that as we were successful in applying the word regularly
[time=636] that the school improved.
[time=639] People using God's work to make sure that what they do in the classroom is what he would want
[time=646] them to do, not their own opinion.
[time=648] And so I then was given an opportunity to step up and come to Blackhawk Christian School as a coach here, and I took that job.
[time=656] Renee and I came over in 1979.
[time=659] We've been here since then, and I'm grateful to say that God has blessed our school richly.
[time=666] Parents often have a couple fears when they consider sending their children to a Christian school.
[time=673] One fear that I hear often is a fear that I understand.
[time=679] They think that maybe their children will be sheltered somewhat from the world, and that upon graduation from a Christian school, they might not be prepared to face the onslaught
[time=690] of some things that may come before them.
[time=695] I wish that were true that we could shelter our children from all the evils of the world.
[time=700] We know that we can't do that at our school, but I do try to make sure that we use the word of God
[time=707] to declare the fact that as children are obedient to him, as they fear and revere the Lord God Himself,
[time=714] they'll be successful in this world.
[time=717] I think the best possible preparation is not experience of the bad things that might happen to them,
[time=723] but rather learning what the Bible has to say about the way they should live individually.
[time=728] And that does prepare them.
[time=730] We've had a few graduates now, and I'm pleased to say that they're doing very well.
[time=735] They have been equipped, and as they choose to apply what they've learned, they are successful.
[time=741] Another fear that parents often have is that our academic preparation may not be adequate.
[time=747] Because we're a small school, our facilities aren't as good as some other schools.
[time=753] And yet, I'm confident that our teachers and the materials that we use, filtered through the word, prepare our students completely for anything that they might want to do.
[time=764] Our graduates are doing very well in colleges, many different colleges.
[time=768] Next year, we have a couple of kids that are enrolled at Purdue.
[time=770] We have some that go to IU, many that go to Christian colleges like Liberty, Cedarville, Grace College, Taylor.
[time=776] I'm pleased that they're very successful at what they're doing.
[time=779] And I'm encouraged that our students are prepared.
[time=782] They're ready to face whatever academic requirements they might have to meet in college.
[time=787] You know, I have a couple fears of my own.
[time=790] The fears I have are for your children that they won't have the opportunity to experience
[time=796] the good things that we have to offer that can't be found other places.
[time=800] One thing that I want to make sure my children have the opportunity to experience is having friends who come from families like yours.
[time=808] I know that my children don't just learn at school and they don't just learn at home.
[time=813] They learn much from other children and from other children's parents as they visit them and as they hear what those children have to report about their moms and dads.
[time=822] You folks have a tremendous impact not only on your own children, but on your children's friends as well.
[time=828] And I want my children to be able to go to a school where they will make friends that come from families like yours,
[time=834] where the Word of God is central, where Jesus Christ is lifted up.
[time=839] Another thing that I want my children to experience and I fear that you might not have your children experience is the dedicated and qualified faculty that we have in our school.
[time=849] I'm confident that our teachers are as good as any teachers in the United States, and they're better than many.
[time=856] They do focus their attention on Christ, but also we want to make sure that our children aren't short changed academically
[time=864] and they dedicate many hours to being sure that what they prepare for your children to learn is adequate preparation for them.
[time=871] We have really fine faculty members who love God and love your children.
[time=878] I would admonish you to consider what it says in Deuteronomy 6 when it says that in every single aspect of your child's life,
[time=887] in every walk as they sit, as they walk, as they talk, that you will be teaching them the truth of the Word.
[time=893] We're founded on that excellent academic structure, but also the Word of God. It's central in education.
[time=901] I'd ask that you please choose Black Hawk Christian School for your children.
[time=909] Thank you, Steve. Black Hawk Christian School is a school that we operate as a church fully accredited here in the state of Indiana,
[time=917] and we're looking forward to our oldest daughter going there next year, half and half.
[time=922] We're looking forward to her, but it's always a strange feeling to have your oldest child head off to school,
[time=928] and you begin to realize that they're growing up.
[time=931] We thank God that we have a fine school like this that our children will be attending.
[time=935] Now we're going to hear from some of our young people from our church.
[time=939] This musical group is directed by Rick Halls, and their name is the Second Generation, and they're going to sing a melody of songs for us, and we appreciate the training that they've had and the effort they've put into ministering to us today. Thank you, Second Generation.
[time=958] [MUSIC] Where have you been? [MUSIC] Where are you going? [MUSIC] What is a life coming to? [MUSIC] Where is the meaning? [MUSIC] Where is the purpose? [MUSIC] Where when we're all proud? [MUSIC] Is searching for Jesus, looking to find hope for tomorrow, [MUSIC] and some peace of mind, [MUSIC] where you can find him in the Bible, [MUSIC] and many churches that I know, [MUSIC] until you find him in a mirror, [MUSIC] you've got a long way to go, [MUSIC] so mirror, mirror, mirror, [MUSIC] on the wall, I know, [MUSIC] I know who is, who is, [MUSIC] Lord of all, [MUSIC] just let me see him, [MUSIC] everyday, [MUSIC] for me that is, [MUSIC] the only way. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] Anybody here wanna live forever, [MUSIC] say I do. [MUSIC] Anybody here wanna walk on golden streets, [MUSIC] say I do. [MUSIC] Anybody here sick and tired of living like you do. [MUSIC] Anybody here wanna hold my phone forever, [MUSIC] say I do. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] On again, that's really been a change to me. [MUSIC] Born again, just like Jesus said. [MUSIC] Born again and all because of Calvary. [MUSIC] I'm glad so glad that I've been born again. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] We lean before my Lord, I stand. [MUSIC] And in me, not one clemish does he see. [MUSIC] When I placed all my burdens on him. [MUSIC] He washed them all from me. [MUSIC] Live for Jesus, that's what matters. [MUSIC] And with other houses, trouble mind is strong.

[time=1511] I sing because I'm happy.
[time=1515] I sing because I'm free.
[time=1520] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1527] And I know he watches me.
[time=1535] Why should I feel discouraged?
[time=1540] Why should the shadows fall?
[time=1545] Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home?
[time=1556] When Jesus is my portion, my constant friend is here.
[time=1569] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1576] And I know he watches me.
[time=1583] His eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1590] And I know he watches me.
[time=1598] I sing because I'm happy.
[time=1602] I sing because I'm free.
[time=1607] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1614] And I know he watches me.
[time=1622] Whenever I am tempted.
[time=1627] Whenever clouds rise.
[time=1632] When song gives way to sigh.
[time=1637] When hope within me dies.
[time=1642] I draw the closer to him.
[time=1649] From care he sets me free.
[time=1655] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1662] And I know he watches me.
[time=1669] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1678] And I know he watches me.
[time=1686] I sing because I'm happy.
[time=1690] I sing because I'm free.
[time=1695] For his eye is on the sparrow.
[time=1703] And I know he watches me.
[time=1733] Thank you Marilyn.
[time=1738] Our Father we thank you that you love us and that you watch over us.
[time=1744] Father it seems incomprehensible to us that your eye knows the very detail of our lives and that you care.
[time=1755] Father today we've come to celebrate your love and your care.
[time=1760] We've come to praise you and to sing of your goodness and your greatness and to declare to this community that you are Lord and God.
[time=1770] Father we want every thought of our mind to be centered in you in these moments.
[time=1775] We want your word to speak to our hearts.
[time=1778] We pray that it would be a word of courage to those who face difficulty.
[time=1784] A word of comfort to those who are facing hurt. A word of strength to those who've walked with weakness.
[time=1791] A word of refreshment to those that are tired. A word of renewal to those who've grown weary.
[time=1798] God we ask this service to be one that praises you but also that strengthens our lives.
[time=1805] Father we've met to praise you. We pray that you would give us wisdom through your word.
[time=1811] Speak to our hearts we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1818] Decision making. Something that we constantly are doing in our life and yet it's one of the most difficult things we do as well.
[time=1831] It seems that as we approach a decision the more we study it the more complicated it becomes.
[time=1841] It appears that if I can just get this one piece of data sorted through then I'll have all of my analysis complete.
[time=1849] All the facts will be on the table and a decision can be made.
[time=1853] And so we pursue that piece of data only to discover that that piece of data unlocks a whole new door
[time=1861] and behind it stands ten more pieces of data to be pursued.
[time=1866] It seems the more information we collect the more impossible the decision is to make.
[time=1872] Decision making.
[time=1874] In many ways it's like chasing down rabbits.
[time=1877] Pursuing rabbit trails never define the rabbit at the end of it.
[time=1882] Our decisions seldom seem to be black and white, high contrast.
[time=1887] It seems that we're always trying to postulate.
[time=1891] Well if I choose option A then these dominoes will all fall.
[time=1900] One option will cause no dominoes to fall.
[time=1903] Which will cause the least dominoes to fall.
[time=1905] And frustration and anxiety builds as decisions are made.
[time=1909] Jesus spoke about making decisions and I want to invite you to open your Bibles with us to Matthew chapter 7 and verses 13 and 14.
[time=1921] It's rather interesting in reading a book that speaks about executives and decision making.
[time=1928] It's a fascinating book it's entitled What They Didn't Teach You at Harvard Business School.
[time=1935] Sort of the layman's inside track to figure out how it's all supposed to work.
[time=1941] And in the section on decision making McCormick does a fine job of tracing down all of the
[time=1947] analytical paths that lead to data to be collected and then he makes a statement that I totally relate to.
[time=1954] Do you notice how you like people who agree with you?
[time=1957] McCormick says then you apply the most important ingredient in decision making and he calls it
[time=1963] fly by the seat of your pants.
[time=1965] Sounds very sophisticated doesn't it?
[time=1969] What he meant by that is this.
[time=1971] There are many decisions that we make apart from the data.
[time=1977] Not so analytical as much as they are intuitive.
[time=1982] Now many times we do confuse the issue with the facts.
[time=1988] One of our engineers told me last week that he gets frustrated with his whole team of double E men.
[time=1995] Electrical engineers and he finally says to them too much analysis leads to paralysis.
[time=2000] There's a lot of truth in that isn't it?
[time=2003] Quite often we can make the best decisions in life if we've done our homework we've collected the data
[time=2010] and then we lay the data on the table and say alright let's put this in high contrast.
[time=2017] Like an artist who gives up all the colors all the shades of different colors and trying to blend them all together and simply gets out a black pen and puts it on a white piece of paper
[time=2028] and puts things in sharp contrast.
[time=2032] That's exactly what Jesus has done in the seventh chapter of Matthew.
[time=2038] He puts things in high contrast.
[time=2041] He contrasts three things.
[time=2044] We'll look at the first today.
[time=2046] First of all he contrasts two gates that lead to two paths.
[time=2052] Next week we'll notice that he studies in contrast two teachers and finally in contrast two foundations.
[time=2061] Matthew chapter 7 verses 13 and 14.
[time=2066] Enter in at the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction.
[time=2079] And many there be then enter in that way.
[time=2087] Because narrow is the gate and hard is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it.
[time=2102] High contrast two paths not three not thirteen two gates two destinations two groups of people.
[time=2114] Jesus is approaching decision making at the very core by making it very clear that there are only two options.
[time=2121] Let's follow his thinking through and notice the four contrasts that he does make.
[time=2127] First of all he contrasts two gates and the King James Bible says the straight gate.
[time=2133] If you'll notice that word straight is not spelled like we spelled straight today because that's not our word straight.
[time=2139] And it doesn't mean straight as in a direct line from point A to point B without any deviation.
[time=2146] The word straight as it is spelled here S-T-R-A-I-T means narrow.
[time=2152] It's a King James word.
[time=2154] So let's just replace it and use the word narrow it'll help us.
[time=2158] Now Jesus contrasts two gates one is being very narrow the others being very wide.
[time=2166] What he is basically saying is one of these gates is very obvious it's standing wide open in front of you.
[time=2173] It's very accessible there aren't many obstacles it's pretty easy to get to and to get through.
[time=2179] As a matter of fact that wide gate usually is well trodden in the path that leads to it.
[time=2185] And there's usually a great crowd of people going through the gate at any given point in time.
[time=2190] As a matter of fact you can just more or less go with the flow and you'll find the gate and get through it.
[time=2198] Where the other gate is quite different.
[time=2202] It's narrow.
[time=2204] It's not so obvious.
[time=2207] It's not nearly so accessible there are obstacles it's difficult.
[time=2212] And the path is not well trodden this path calls for some pioneering.
[time=2218] You lay down the first steps.
[time=2221] And rather than going with the flow quite often you're going to have to go against the flow.
[time=2228] There are two gates.
[time=2230] One it's so wide and so open that anyone can see it.
[time=2234] There's a crowd going through it.
[time=2236] When we had the youth in Florida a number of years ago in Sarasota I said to somebody down in Sarasota how do you get to Disney World?
[time=2243] He said it's easy just take interstate four.
[time=2246] I said where do you get off and you know what are the little roads that get you there?
[time=2249] He said don't worry about it mister everybody in the world is going there this week.
[time=2253] Just follow them.
[time=2256] That's often how life is.
[time=2258] There's a wide gate and everybody in the world's going through it.
[time=2262] And all we need to do if we want to go through the wide gate is getting a flow and it'll take us through there.
[time=2270] But notice Jesus encouragement is this.
[time=2274] Avoid the wide gate.
[time=2276] Attractive?
[time=2277] Yes.
[time=2278] Assessable?
[time=2279] Certainly.
[time=2280] Easy.
[time=2281] That's what it promises.
[time=2283] He said avoid it.
[time=2285] Instead he directed our attention to a narrow gate.
[time=2289] Difficult.
[time=2290] Straight.
[time=2292] Hard.
[time=2293] Not so obvious.
[time=2298] Even the question aroused in my own mind.
[time=2301] God if you want me to go through that narrow gate then why on earth would you make it narrow and inaccessible and hard and difficult
[time=2308] and certainly you'd want it to be obvious so everyone would see it.
[time=2313] God if that's your choice why not be more open about it.
[time=2318] So as I studied Nat Linger in the back of my mind I came across this quotation from Augustine.
[time=2324] The fourth century A.D.
[time=2326] Augustine said this concerning the narrow gate.
[time=2331] It is not so much that the gate is narrow in and of itself as that we make it narrow for ourselves by the swelling of our pride.
[time=2345] And then angered and frustrated that we cannot enter chafing and impatient at the hindrances that we meet we become the more unable to pass through it.
[time=2364] Maybe it's not so much that the gate is narrow as I am wide.
[time=2371] Maybe it's the standard that's right and I'm out of balance.
[time=2377] I always want to change the standard when God's looking for me to change.
[time=2383] You've seen those big scales.
[time=2386] Why someone would put them by a restaurant I don't know but you put a penny in them and it tells you your weight.
[time=2391] Why you would want to pay to know that I don't know either.
[time=2395] But I got on the scale this one restaurant in the lobby where you waited and I discovered something.
[time=2401] I am three inches too short for my weight.
[time=2405] I want to change the scale.
[time=2408] That's what we do with this passage.
[time=2411] We say the gate it's too narrow.
[time=2414] It's not accessible. It's not obvious.
[time=2417] It's not wide open.
[time=2419] I criticize the gate and the problem is I'm not looking.
[time=2424] I'm not searching. I'm not willing to bring my life into conforming with the gate so therefore the gate's wrong.
[time=2433] The gate's right.
[time=2436] Jesus said enter in it.
[time=2438] Secondly he makes another contrast.
[time=2441] This time he contrasts not the gate but the path that lies on the other side of the gate.
[time=2448] Contrast is very very similar. He says the wide gate leads to a broad path.
[time=2458] The narrow gate leads to an equally narrow path.
[time=2463] William Barkley the fine New Testament historian makes these points of contrast.
[time=2467] One is wide, the other is narrow.
[time=2471] One is easy and the other is hard.
[time=2475] One calls for freedom from discipline.
[time=2479] The other demands discipline.
[time=2483] One is short.
[time=2485] The other is long.
[time=2488] You know there's something in us isn't there.
[time=2491] That we always want to take the easy route, the short route.
[time=2498] Someone's going to come up with a law like Murphy's law and Parkinson's law.
[time=2503] Whoever does it will give their name to the law but it will go something like this.
[time=2508] There's no system that can't be beat.
[time=2511] We're committed to it as humans.
[time=2514] We're going to short circuit the system. We're going to get around it.
[time=2518] We're going to bypass all the obstacles. We're going to take the shortcuts.
[time=2523] There's no time in my life that has desired that more than behind the steering wheel.
[time=2529] When you're driving down the bypass, what it bypasses none of us knows.
[time=2538] When you look at that long flow of traffic and you're certain there's one of these streets that'll beat the system.
[time=2546] I want to suggest to you if you're new to Fort Wayne we have three rivers and one bridge.
[time=2550] You don't want to try to beat the system.
[time=2553] There are more dead ends in Fort Wayne closed subdivisions that there's no way out than anywhere else in the world.
[time=2562] I've discovered every one of them.
[time=2566] No doubt whenever I'm in a hurry instead of taking the route that you know will get you there, I'll beat the system.
[time=2572] So I think.
[time=2574] I'm going to just go down this little alley and we're going to cut across this main street and we're going to turn and we're going to go across this bridge that they took out in 1981.
[time=2582] Isn't that how we approach life though?
[time=2586] We're going to beat the system.
[time=2587] We're going to find a shortcut.
[time=2589] We're going to take a way that's going to make it easier.
[time=2594] Don't do it.
[time=2598] There's no shortcuts in life.
[time=2601] Not that ultimately don't come back to haunt us.
[time=2604] There's no easy way that's going to work other than God's way.
[time=2611] Two gates, they lead to two paths.
[time=2616] And every path leads to a destination.
[time=2622] The wide gate that's followed by the wide path leads to destruction.
[time=2630] When Jesus used that word destruction, I'm not going to pretend to know the total thought that he possessed.
[time=2637] But I believe he meant that not only in its eternal sense, which he certainly did.
[time=2642] He meant that it led to an eternity without Christ, an eternity without God, an eternity in hell.
[time=2650] I think he was also telling us that we would experience that destruction in our life today.
[time=2656] You know, if we listen to the modern musicians today, they tell us about living life in the fast lane.
[time=2662] The wide lane, they tell us of its high toll.
[time=2667] That's cost on our life today.
[time=2670] You know, the billboards on each side of the wide gate promise a wide path.
[time=2680] And they produce.
[time=2683] But what they don't tell you is that when you get in that freeway, in that wide path, you start to accelerate your car.
[time=2690] When you're driving in the fast lane, they don't tell you that the road suddenly turns bad.
[time=2695] They don't tell you of the potholes. They don't tell you of the dangers, the curves that will throw you.
[time=2703] And the high probability of an accident that may be limiting to your life forever.
[time=2712] The destruction that you may reap as you speed down that wide path, or do they tell you of the ultimate destination?
[time=2722] Eternity in hell without Christ.
[time=2725] Where's the narrow path?
[time=2728] Hard, yes, discipline, certainly.
[time=2731] Where does it lead?
[time=2733] Jesus said it leads to life.
[time=2736] There are a number of Greek words for life.
[time=2738] There's the basic word "bios" from which we get biology, which simply means that we're alive, that we exist.
[time=2744] We eat, we sleep, we drink, we function.
[time=2747] We're alive, as opposed to dead.
[time=2750] There's a different word, "zoase." "zoase" refers not to so much life in its existence as much as life in its quality, its characteristics, its dimension.
[time=2762] By "zoase," the Greek meant the fullness of life, its gusto, if you will.
[time=2769] That's why Jesus said, "The thief comes but to steal and to kill."
[time=2777] But I'm come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly.
[time=2782] You see that narrow gate that is difficult, and none of us want to mislead you, that leads to a narrow path that is exactly what it says, narrow.
[time=2791] It leads on to a life eternal yes, and we look forward to that, but it also leads in Jesus' words today to an abundant life.
[time=2802] Most of us go through the wide gate because of the appearance of peace and prosperity, significance and security, hope and honor.
[time=2813] We find it empty, but it's only in that narrow path that we begin to find the fulfillment of our life that only God can bring.
[time=2822] Two gates lead to two paths which lead to two distant destinations, totally different.
[time=2833] And finally, by a fourth contrast, they lead also to two different groups.
[time=2843] Tragically, unfortunately, that wide gate that leads to destruction is followed by many people.
[time=2855] And the narrow gate that leads on to life is followed by few, so said Jesus himself.
[time=2862] Dietrich Bonhoeffer gives us this advice in the cost of discipleship.
[time=2868] The disciples are few in number and will always be few.
[time=2873] This saying of Jesus for stalls all exaggerated hopes of success never let the disciples of Christ pin their hopes on large numbers.
[time=2886] A man from this country went to South Africa to speak. Radio and television covered it as a major event.
[time=2894] After he had spoken and proclaimed the gospel of Christ in a television interview, he was asked the question,
[time=2900] "Sir, if Christianity is so true and if Christ is the only way, then why is it that so few of the leaders follow Christ?"
[time=2908] So many of the wealthy, so many of the influential, so many of the learned people follow Christ.
[time=2913] If it's so right, why don't they know it?
[time=2917] The answer was both quick and appropriate.
[time=2921] The more an individual earns and the more an individual learns, the easier it becomes to trust in himself and to fail to see his need for God.
[time=2936] Those are the contrast that Jesus made.
[time=2942] I'd like us now to draw out of this some very practical insight, some applications that we need to learn.
[time=2950] The first one I'd like to make is this. The majority is often, no usually wrong.
[time=2959] The majority is usually wrong. Please don't misunderstand me. I love democracy. I believe in it and I'd fight for it.
[time=2970] But that doesn't make the majority right. It just protects us from an oligarchy, the dominant tyranny of a few.
[time=2980] But let's think about that.
[time=2983] The majority are on their way down the wide path into destruction, but you know that's not uncommon in life because the majority is usually wrong.
[time=2992] Moses sent in 12 spies into the land of Canaan to take a report, to make a survey, to come back, and the majority, 10 out of 12 said, "We can't go in there."
[time=3005] And the majority was wrong. A nation stood before a choice of kings, Ramon and Jeroboam.
[time=3015] Neither were excellent choices, but it was very clear that one, although he was limited, represented obedience to God and the other represented disobedience to God, and the majority was wrong, and they chose Jeroboam.
[time=3030] A great crowd of people gathered around Jesus, and he began to teach upon the cost of discipleship.
[time=3038] And once he had done that, John chapter 6 tells us in the multitude, the majority left it and followed him no more. The majority was wrong.
[time=3050] A crowd gathered around Pontius Pilate, and he said, "I'll give you a choice. Do you want Jesus? Or do you want Barabbas?"
[time=3060] And the majority said, "Give us Barabbas."
[time=3068] The majority is often wrong. You know what's so tragic about that? Most of us make our decisions based upon this axiom. Everybody else is doing it.
[time=3085] I mean, we often don't have any more solid reason for our decision than the fact that the guy in front of us made that decision. You know, that is intuitive.
[time=3097] Before our oldest child was three years old, she had already learned how to use that. Can I ride my big wheel in the street? No, honey, you can't. Why? Everybody else is. And she was right.
[time=3111] On the street, and there are big wheels, bikes, everything. Kids just zipping every which way.
[time=3116] And her total argument was, the majority is doing it. I ought to be allowed to. Three years old. Thirteen-year-old comes home. Mom, Dad, I'd like to go to, and then they describe some activity that causes your blood to curdle.
[time=3140] And you say, "No, you're not going there." To which they respond, "Oh, come on. Everybody else is." And he's right. The majority are going.
[time=3154] You're not three. You're not thirteen. You're evaluating a decision, and it's a tough one.
[time=3162] And that right side of the brain, that intuition is beginning to lead you down a certain path. That's not really where you want to go. It'd be easier to go this way.
[time=3173] And all of your instincts say to go that way, but this way it'd be easier, and so you'd do it, because after all, everyone else is. Everyone else is.
[time=3185] There's probably not a worse reason to do something than the fact that everyone else is, because you see the majority is often, if not usually wrong.
[time=3196] A second application of all of this. The easy way and the right way are seldom the same way.
[time=3209] There's an easy way and a right way, and they are seldom the same way. I don't know how many times each of us have faced decisions, and we have adopted the Charlie Brown philosophy.
[time=3223] There is no problem in life so big it can't be run away from. And we take the easy path. Each of us is like water. It's our nature to take the course of least resistance.
[time=3238] We yearn for the easy way out. We want to go with the flow, cause no waves.
[time=3247] You know, it is seldom in life that the easy and the right thing are the same thing. So seldom. So seldom.
[time=3257] Usually taking the easy way buys us two things. It buys us a little time.
[time=3264] And only a little bit, because we're ultimately going to have to face those problems again.
[time=3270] It buys us a little time, and it buys us a lot more problems.
[time=3277] Left to themselves, things do not get better.
[time=3282] In engineering, it's called the laws of thermodynamics. Things go from greater order to less order.
[time=3289] More practically, in terms of a house mother, three kids in the house left to themselves don't straighten their rooms.
[time=3300] Life's problems don't have a way of working themselves out. If a problem ever worked itself out, it's because there was somebody or some group standing behind working feverishly to make them happen.
[time=3313] Don't take the easy way. Thirdly, when you choose a gate, you are choosing a destiny. Don't ever forget that.
[time=3330] When you choose to enter in a gate, you're choosing a destiny at the same time.
[time=3336] I don't know how many times the counselors heard these pathetic statements, usually through sobs.
[time=3344] I didn't mean for it to end up like this. I didn't think this would happen. How on earth did it end up in this mess?
[time=3356] Too often, our lives are like a roller coaster.
[time=3362] Once you get on, you can't get off. A number of years ago, we took the youth group to seat her point, and as we all got on the Gemini, I ended up on a seat by myself, which is a little socially awkward.
[time=3373] Half way up the hill, I decided I know how to have some fun. There were two junior high girls in the seat in front of me.
[time=3379] They had spent at least two hours each on their hair. They kept proctoring gamble in business.
[time=3385] We're clicking the clank up to the top of the hill. I just couldn't pass the urge, so I said, "Boy, I hope I don't get sick again."
[time=3394] They turned around. They lifted up these well-covered eyelids and said, "Mr, get off the ride right now!"
[time=3403] We went over the hill. There's no getting off the roller coaster.
[time=3409] At least not living to tell about it.
[time=3413] You know, sometimes you enter a gate and you go over that hill, and you may not be able to get off of it.
[time=3421] When you choose a gate, you're making a choice of destiny at the same time, and choose so wisely.
[time=3431] Choose ever, ever so wisely, because you probably won't be able to get off, just because you want to.
