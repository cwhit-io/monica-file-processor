[time=30] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=54] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=60] it's the Bible hour.
[time=62] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=72] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=75] [MUSIC]
[time=92] I sing my soul, my Savior God to thee, I'll pray now, I'll pray now, I'll sing my soul,
[time=107] my Savior God to thee, I'll pray now, I'll pray now, I'll pray now, I'll sing my soul,
[time=127] thank you, you may be seated.
[time=131] What a joy for us it is today, to come together and to sing how great thou art.
[time=137] As Pete mentioned a moment ago, we have as our special guest with us today, the sounds of heritage from Heritage Christian College in San Diego, where our former pastor and founder and friend pastor David Jeremiah is, and we are looking forward to this day of lifting our hearts together by joining hands with these young people and bringing praise to our Savior the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=159] We're delighted that you've come to this auditorium, members and friends and guests alike, and so thrilled also for our privilege by way of television to come into many homes and hospital rooms today, and it's our deepest prayer and most sincere desire that the Lord Jesus Christ would be glorified and magnified in every way and that each of our hearts would
[time=179] be drawn closer to him.
[time=181] Let us now listen to the ministry of music of the sounds of heritage as they lead us in our worship.
[time=215] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=350] Thank you very much sounds of heritage.
[time=353] Today it's my privilege once again to focus your attention on the ministry of the Black Hawk Christian School here in our church, and I hope that you will read the back of the bulletin again today.
[time=364] Our school board chairman took time to write a note to you there, and even a greater privilege
[time=370] today is to introduce to you Gwen Keaton, our sixth grade teacher.
[time=376] Gwen is a fine teacher and a fine woman of God.
[time=380] I'm thankful that she could be with us today.
[time=381] Gwen, how long have you been in education?
[time=384] This is my seventh year of teaching.
[time=386] I taught for four years at East Noble Schools in Noble County, and now this is my third year here at Black Hawk.
[time=391] Why did you decide to come to Black Hawk Christian?
[time=394] I really enjoyed where I was teaching before.
[time=396] It was a neat school, and I joined the people that I worked with, but as long as I started coming here to Black Hawk to some basketball games and other activities and got to know some of the students and the teachers that were here, we just saw a real difference in the quality of their lives and the things that were happening here.
[time=411] As I began praying about considering coming here to Black Hawk to teach, I spent a day here in one of the classes, and that showed me, I had thought that Christian education met having devotions in the morning and a Bible class sometime during the day, and I saw that instead, besides that, there was just an incorporation of the Bible throughout the day, and they really used God as the authority throughout the day.
[time=432] I encourage parents to come visit often, and when they do, sometimes they choose for the very same reason to enroll their children here.
[time=440] Gwen, what have you been able to do here that maybe you couldn't do in the public school system?
[time=446] Luke 252 says that Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature in a favor with God and man, and where I was teaching before, I could help them increase in wisdom, the intellectual area of their life, in favor with man in their social areas, and increase in stature, their
[time=461] physical development, but I couldn't do much as far as their spiritual aspect of their lives, and that's the most important, or the lasting area of our life, and now I can use that and help train the students and that area of their lives, work with their parents in training them up in the way that they'd like to see their children develop, and throughout the day, as we study and social studies, the development of our country, we can talk about the impact that God had in that, and in science, as we see that God was the creator, it just
[time=488] using the Bible is just a natural part of our teaching throughout the day.
[time=491] And that's why we have a school, and as the word is lived out in lives of people like
[time=498] Gwen Keaton, our students are able then to see that you are able to apply the word of God in your daily life, and I'm so glad she's here, and we have many others, she's a representative
[time=508] and a good one of what our faculty is like here at Black Hawk Christian.
[time=512] Gwen, do you have any closing remarks that you'd like to make?
[time=514] I'm just really thankful to be here, I'm thankful for the support of parents and the concern for their children, and I just really encourage anyone who's considering sending their children here to come and spend the day, and that's where you really see the impact and the quality of education that's here.
[time=528] All right, thank you very much for coming.
[time=531] Also today, we are privileged to have our speech class represented.
[time=537] Mr. Leon Pippen, our speech teacher, has put together this choral reading, and they will share with you from the word of God in a little different style than we're accustomed to.
[time=547] I'm glad that they can be here, this is the Black Hawk Christian School Speech Class.
[time=552] David Salma, thanks.
[time=554] Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name, make known among the nations what he has done.
[time=559] Sing to him, sing praise to him, tell of all his wonderful acts, glory in his holy name,
[time=566] let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice, look to the Lord and his strength,
[time=572] see his face always, remember the wonder she has done, his miracles and the judgments he pronounced, O descendants of Israel, his servants, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
[time=583] He is the Lord our God, his judgments are in all the earth.
[time=587] He remembers his covenant forever.
[time=590] The word he commanded for a thousand generations.
[time=593] The covenant he made with Abraham.
[time=595] The oath he swore to Isaac.
[time=597] He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree.
[time=599] To Israel as an everlasting covenant.
[time=602] To you I will give the land of Canaan as a portion you inherit.
[time=606] They were of a few in number, few in deed and strangers in it.
[time=610] They wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
[time=614] He allowed no man to oppress them, for they say he will be the king.
[time=618] Do not touch my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm.
[time=623] Sing to the Lord all the earth, proclaim his salvation day after day.
[time=632] Declan his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[time=637] For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise, he is to be feared above all gods.
[time=641] For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens, splendor and
[time=647] majesty are before him, strength and joy in his dwelling place, ascribed to the Lord of families of nations, ascribed to the Lord in glory and strength, ascribed to the Lord
[time=658] and the glory to his name, bring an offering and come before him, worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness, tremble before him all the earth.
[time=668] The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.
[time=675] Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad, let the heavens say that the Lord reigns,
[time=681] let the sea resound and all that is in it, let the fields be jubilant and everything in them.
[time=686] Then the trees of the forest will say, they will sing in the joy before the Lord, before he comes to judge the earth.
[time=698] Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, his love endures forever.
[time=703] Cry out, save us all God our Savior, gather us and deliver us from the nations that we
[time=709] make it thanks to your holy name, that we make glory in your praise.
[time=714] Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
[time=723] Then all the people say amen and praise the Lord.
[time=742] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=746] We have as our special guest with us today the sounds of heritage, you've heard from them once musically and will be looking forward to hearing from them again.
[time=754] With Pete and I today is our friend Steve Longbreak who is the administrator of our school.
[time=758] Good morning, Steve.
[time=759] Good morning.
[time=760] Today we've asked you to come to tell our television friends a bit about Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=765] This seems to me to be one of the best years we've ever had.
[time=768] How does it appear to you?
[time=770] This really has been an excellent year.
[time=772] I'm excited about what the Lord has done as our students have grown academically and spiritually, especially in the spiritual realm.
[time=779] They've really come off a strong Christian week of influence in the spiritual emphasis week and they've done it very well in listening to what the Word has to say in applying it.
[time=788] I'm really thankful for that.
[time=790] You know, usually in the given year we have a great deal of personal contact with the students even though I don't teach in the school and I can't remember a year where there was more excitement.
[time=800] We have six or seven of our kids going on summer mission trips.
[time=803] We've got kids working in Christian camps this summer, it's a very exciting prospect.
[time=808] Tell our people just a little bit about what a Christian school is lest they not understand.
[time=812] All right.
[time=813] One of the strongest reasons that I believe our school has been successful this year is
[time=819] that our teachers have stayed for several years in a row.
[time=822] Our turnover rate has been very, very low and this next year we're only losing one teacher
[time=828] that's because she's desiring to have a baby at this time.
[time=830] So having the same people year after year makes a really consistent influence on the children using the Word and applying it every day to their lives personally helps teach the children how to do that as well.
[time=841] You know, Steve has alluded to the spiritual dimension of our school and that is the pinnacle of what we're about directing lives towards the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=850] But our theme is academic excellence on the biblical foundation.
[time=854] Tell us a little bit about academic excellence.
[time=857] We're thrilled that our students are choosing strong colleges to go to and they're doing very well, we've had four graduating classes now and all of them are reporting back to us that they've been very well prepared.
[time=869] We also give a standardized achievement test each year and our scores have been very high at least two grade levels above average.
[time=876] And I'm really thankful that our students are learning.
[time=879] If we will stand firmly on the Bible and teach those strong academics they'll be equipped.
[time=883] Well, I'm committed to it and Kathy and I are looking forward to September when our oldest daughter Rachel begins school and she begins it right here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=893] April is a month when we open up registration to the community.
[time=897] There's already been registration for existing school families and tell our people how they could register their children or perhaps if they're interested their grandchildren.
[time=906] Right now our children at Black Hawk Christian School have been re-registered as Pastor Rick said.
[time=911] You can call the Black Hawk Christian School at 749-8524 to receive information about
[time=917] registering your own children.
[time=919] We'd be excited to hear from you.
[time=921] Again that number is 749-8524 and if you're interested in Christian education as we are
[time=929] and you have some children or perhaps some grandchildren that you could talk their parents into a Christian education you may want to help.
[time=937] Many times that is a way that a young person has the opportunity to go to a school like ours.
[time=942] Steve any final comments?
[time=943] No, I just really look forward to meeting new people and we do have many new registrants this year already.
[time=949] Please call us if you're interested.
[time=952] Again thank you Steve.
[time=954] Pete you have a keen interest in Christian education as well.
[time=957] Yes we have a daughter who's in college and two of our boys are in the Black Hawk Christian
[time=963] School and Steve we're delighted with the school.
[time=965] Also having taught many years it's exciting to just watch the kids go from class to class and see the quality of the young people that we have at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=974] And it's fitting today that we have a musical group that are our guests from Heritage Christian College in San Diego.
[time=980] We have the sounds of heritage with us.
[time=983] They were here last year and they're a full-time ministry team that travel from the college from Oklahoma California and Christian Heritage College.
[time=991] We're always glad when they come to minister to us because they're a blessing to our hearts and uplift us with their great music.
[time=998] Well we're looking forward to hearing from them in just a moment but we have this pamphlet we want to offer you before we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1007] It's entitled Comfort Ye My People.
[time=1009] This past week I was back in Akron Ohio for the funeral of my brother-in-law's grandfather
[time=1015] and what an impact God's word can have to comfort people in the time of sorrow.
[time=1021] Perhaps you've lost a loved one or lost a job or gone through a divorce or are frustrated with your career or perhaps your children have broken your heart and you're in need of comfort.
[time=1031] God's word is the source of all comfort through His Spirit and we want you to have this free
[time=1038] from us to you by simply writing and asking for it.
[time=1041] If you would write to us today we would send you a copy.
[time=1045] Simply write the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1054] And our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1063] Pete and Steve, thank you for joining us today and we're looking forward to going back to the live part of our morning worship service and the people who are with us today from San Diego ministering to us in song.
[time=1079] O Lord, you are the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for thou
[time=1089] has created all things that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible.
[time=1096] Whether they be thrones or demeans or principalities or powers, all things were created by you
[time=1103] and for you, and you are before all things and by you all things consist, for it pleased
[time=1112] the Father that in you should all fullness dwell.
[time=1116] He spoke the words and all the words came into order, you waved your hand and blooded's
[time=1128] filled celestial skies, you placed a woman and a man inside the garden, and though they
[time=1139] found compassion in your eyes, O Lord, I stand in awe of the wonder of your deeds, yet a
[time=1152] greater wonder brings me to my knees, Lord, I praise you because of who you are, not
[time=1166] because of all the mighty things you've done, Lord, I worship you because of who you are,
[time=1179] you're all the reason that I need to voice my praise, because of who you are.
[time=1189] One holy night you brought your promise from a virgin and promise grew as he revealed
[time=1202] to us your heart and during love displayed throughout his crucifixion and in the dark
[time=1214] you tore the grave and death apart, O Lord, I stand in awe of the wonder of your deeds,
[time=1228] yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees, Lord, I praise you because of who you are,
[time=1240] not because of all the mighty things you've done, Lord, I worship you because of who you
[time=1252] are, you're all the reason that I need to voice my praise, because of who you are,
[time=1263] Lord, I praise you because of who you are, not because of all the mighty things you've done,
[time=1280] Lord, I worship you because of who you are, you're all the reason that I need to voice
[time=1291] my praise because of who you are, Lord, I worship you because of my today, Lord, I worship you
[time=1308] because of who you are, you're all the reason that I need to voice because of who you are,
[time=1325] you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are,
[time=1347] thank you, sounds of heritage for your ministry of music with us today, we are so thankful that you've made the long trip to be with us.
[time=1354] We thank God for the testimony of your school and of your church and of course your pastor, we're so pleased that you're here with us today.
[time=1362] It is such a joy to have friends across the country who are willing to travel and administer to us in song.
[time=1368] I believe you have one more song for us at this time.
[time=1371] We thank God for you being here and we wanted to seize this opportunity to say a word of appreciation for your school and your ministry with us today.
[time=1379] Thank you.
[time=1386] How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me, being so undeserved, yet you gave
[time=1415] your love for me.
[time=1420] The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude.
[time=1431] We thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you, we thank you.
[time=1644] again thank you, it's a joy for us to have you here today to encourage our hearts and to God be the glory.
[time=1652] Our God and our Father we bow before you today to recognize that your Son the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1659] is our Savior and we've come to submit ourselves to him afresh today as our Lord.
[time=1667] O Lord Jesus we pray as did David create a clean heart in me O God and renew a right spirit in me.
[time=1675] Father we ask you to pour out your spirit upon this body of people today and that we might be cleansed
[time=1682] and renewed and refreshed in you, that the flame of fire that burns for God might be rekindled today,
[time=1690] that the very core of our life would be challenged to serve you. Father we thank you for music,
[time=1698] for your word that has been quoted, for testimonies that have been shared, that have brought praise to your name.
[time=1704] God we want our lives to do the same. O Father today we ask you even as we would open your word
[time=1711] to bring into captivity every thought and imagination that the total being that we possess might be directed towards you.
[time=1720] Father through your word today we want to know you and know the power of your resurrection. Father today
[time=1727] may we sense that your word feeds our soul. May it be food to the one who is spiritually hungry for
[time=1733] encouragement. Father we pray for those today and our midst whose families have deteriorated and they're
[time=1740] hanging on. O God today we pray that your word would encourage them and strengthen them. Father
[time=1746] we pray for the one today who is in emotional turmoil, perhaps in this auditorium or perhaps
[time=1752] with a counselor or a clinic this very moment. God we ask you to be working mightily in their
[time=1758] minds and hearts and restoring them. Father today we pray for the body of Christ who have suffered
[time=1765] loss of loved one. We pray for the uplies and the meek today as they have lost parents. May you
[time=1773] today give their hearts comfort and encouragement. We pray today particularly for friends who battle
[time=1779] cancer. We think of Mike Roderick's father and pray that you administer to him heart and soul as
[time=1786] well as body today. Father we pray for those of us who have grown stagnant in our spiritual lives.
[time=1793] Father please don't allow us to cool down and become lukewarm. Kindle fire in our hearts.
[time=1801] May we be as the prophet who said your word was a fire in my heart and I could not put it out.
[time=1806] O God today douse us in consumers with the fire of your love. May it be to the praise of your name.
[time=1813] Amen. How could it happen? How could one person gain captive control of the minds of
[time=1826] dozens of people and the dozens grow to hundreds of people? How could a man whose mind was so
[time=1832] obviously twisted and distorted? Mesmerize and control an audience of hundreds. How could he so
[time=1841] possess their thoughts as to lead them to leave this country and establish a community and a jungle
[time=1849] in a different country in a different continent? How could a Jim Jones take the imaginations of sound
[time=1858] people and lead them to take their very lives hundreds of them at a time? How can it happen?
[time=1868] How can a seemingly bright and attractive collegiate
[time=1875] who's well on their way to everything that life holds to be a value? Find themselves just a few
[time=1882] months later in a different state, barely clothed, standing on a corner from sun up to sundown
[time=1891] selling secondhand flowers. How does it happen? How does it happen that people who
[time=1902] have their basic roots in God's Word suddenly become sidetracked with the spectacular
[time=1909] and leave reason and leave the authority of God's Word to simply pursue the spectacular
[time=1915] and to lead their life in the shipwreck? How does it happen? Matthew chapter seven
[time=1923] we invite you to open to the Sermon on the Mount and study with us this morning from Matthew
[time=1930] chapter seven and verses 15 through 23 and this morning we'll study what Jesus said
[time=1938] about false teachers. The words of the Lord Jesus, "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's
[time=1949] clothing, but inwardly they are raving wolves. You shall know them by their fruits. For men do not
[time=1958] gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit,
[time=1966] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth corrupt fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit,
[time=1974] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth fruit
[time=1981] is hewn down and is cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.
[time=1990] Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord shall enter into my kingdom,
[time=1996] but he that doth the well of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say unto me in that day,
[time=2004] Lord, have we not prophesied in my name? And have we not cast out demons? And in my name,
[time=2016] done wondrous works. Then I will profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me,
[time=2030] ye that work. Iniquity. Jesus had some very ponent, pertinent, powerful words to say
[time=2040] about false teachers. They existed in the times of the Old Testament prophets.
[time=2046] They existed in Jesus' time, and prophetically Peter warns us just as there were false prophets,
[time=2053] so shall there be false teachers among you. In every generation there will be a baited hook,
[time=2061] a charismatic, powerful, influential person, persuasive and elegant, with a repertoire of
[time=2069] credential second to none who will lead and who will deceive. In this passage Jesus gives us at
[time=2079] least three characteristics of a false teacher that we need to be very careful and observe.
[time=2086] First of all, Jesus says this describing the characteristics of a false teacher or a false
[time=2093] prophet. Their appearance will be convincing. Notice he said where a false prophet who come
[time=2104] in sheep's clothing but are actually wolves. It's a consistent metaphor in the Old and New
[time=2110] Testament alike to reckon God's people as sheep. If you'll remember in the Old Testament Psalm 100,
[time=2118] the Bible says that we are the sheep of his pasture. We belong to the Lord. Ezekiel the prophet
[time=2125] spoke of the shepherd who would pastor God's people. Psalm 23 uses the analogy again of
[time=2134] sheep and shepherding to call God our shepherd. Jesus spoke in John chapter 10 that he was the
[time=2142] good shepherd. He laid down his life for the sheep. And what Jesus is here saying is they
[time=2149] are going to rise up false prophets, false teachers who are going to look like they belong. They're
[time=2156] going to look like they fit in. They are going to have the external appearance of being one of God's
[time=2162] sheep. By their outward analysis, by a superficial glance, they're going to have everything in order
[time=2170] and it's going to look like they belong right here. They're one of us.
[time=2175] Their external appearance will be convincing. During the times of the prophet Elijah,
[time=2187] the outer garment, King James the mantle, or the cloak became a symbol of the prophet. Elijah
[time=2196] went around in the country and he had a very rough hairy animal skin as a cloak and he just
[time=2204] tied it around his waist with a belt. And when Elijah grew old and Elijah was selected as his
[time=2213] successor, Elijah took this hairy thick rough animal mantle and he placed it on Elisha as a way of
[time=2223] saying I'm transferring my authority and my power and my gifts to this man. And wisely Elisha prayed,
[time=2230] don't give me the portion of Elijah. God give me a double portion. And from that period of time on,
[time=2238] a wild animal's hide as a mantle, as an outer cloak became a symbol, a credential, an exterior
[time=2248] sign that an individual is a prophet of God. You'll remember on the positive side that John the Baptist
[time=2255] wore such an outfit. It was his way of identifying himself to the people as one set apart as a
[time=2262] prophet to God. But Zechariah chapter 13 verse 4 tells us the corruption, deception, and pollution
[time=2273] had crept in. And there were those who wore the mantle but didn't represent God.
[time=2283] So it is today. There are those that have the title, reverend, doctor, some of them like reverend
[time=2292] doctor. They may go by pastor. They may have some title. They may have the appropriate degrees
[time=2300] from notable universities and Bible schools. They may have the mantle that Americans bow down
[time=2307] in worship, the mantle of success. And they may be broadcasting by way of television or radio,
[time=2313] or they may have published a great number of books. And we are just overcome and impressed
[time=2319] with their success. And our minds begin to use a false reason that says it must be right. It must
[time=2325] be true. Look how many people are coming to that church. Look how many television stations that
[time=2331] particular person's on. They've got the mantle. We need to be very careful because a false teacher,
[time=2342] their external appearance, will be convincing. But secondly, and even more concerning,
[time=2349] Jesus warned this. Not only were their external appearances be convincing, but their words will be convincing. Notice he changes a little bit of the concept in verse 21.
[time=2361] And he says, not everyone that says to me. Now he's not only talking about the false teachers, but about the people as well. But he says, not everyone who says unto me, Lord, show enter into the kingdom of heaven. You see, there are going to be people who are not only going
[time=2376] to appear to be the right stuff, but they're going to say the right things. Their words are
[time=2384] going to be convincing. They're going to say, Lord, Lord, what they say and what they teach
[time=2396] will be very convincing. You see, the only way a false prophet has any power, has any appeal,
[time=2404] is their ability to discriminate between truth and air in their own mind, but not in your mind.
[time=2412] You see, a cult, a false teacher is someone who can take their own truths over here,
[time=2422] and God's truths over here and bring them together and present them to you and to me
[time=2428] as one in the same in a way that we're not able to sort between the two of them.
[time=2435] Do you know that if you went to the average cult today and you asked them all the right questions,
[time=2443] they would give you all of the right answers? You would say to them, do you believe that the
[time=2449] Bible is the Word of God and they would affirm it and declare it and support it through?
[time=2454] You see, what they don't tell you is they believe their own leaders, what they wrote were also the Word of God, and that they weigh the two in a scale and God's
[time=2464] words shrinks and their own little cultic leaders are the dominant thought. But you might change
[time=2471] the question. You might say, well, do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God and they would say, we believe that Jesus is the Son of God. You see, well, they must be Christians.
[time=2483] No, what they didn't tell you was, by Son of God, you mean co-equal, co-eternal with God,
[time=2489] possessing all the same qualities, all the same attributes, all the same powers, one in the same with God. That's what you and I mean, and that's not at all what they mean.
[time=2498] When they use the term Son of God, they mean, yes, he's the Son of God. There's this big God
[time=2504] up in heaven and Jesus was this little bitty God. And we say, Jesus was the Son of God and they say
[time=2512] certainly what they don't tell you is they believe anyone is the Son of God, that will all become the sons of God. And Jesus was just the first to do it.
[time=2524] You see, their words will be convincing.
[time=2528] They're going to say all the right things. They're going to have the buzz words down.
[time=2535] You know how it is? They're meeting someone. Each of you are kind of feeling each other out
[time=2542] to see where you're at spiritually, and suddenly they drop one of those good old, evangelical, fundamental, Bible-believing, back-slapping words and everything's fine, and they just let a little praise the Lord or hallelujah are born again, slip out, and suddenly we think everything's okay. Do you know that many of the religions today
[time=2562] have taken words that we take out of the Bible and have a very specific meaning to, and they've taken those words and taught those same words to their people, but with a totally different concept. You may say to someone, are you born again?
[time=2576] That individual may say, yes, I'm born again. Now you men, have you come to the place where you
[time=2583] put your soul trust in Jesus Christ and you've invited him into your heart as Savior and you've surrendered to him. That's not what they meant. You see, they were taught born again, meant they took communion last Sunday, and that every time they took communion, Jesus comes into their hearts. So you see, they have their phrases, Jesus comes into your heart, born again. They hear it all, but they've taken and the meaning has been changed and people have
[time=2608] been deceived. The gift of a false teacher is his ability to take air and truth and present it all
[time=2619] together and make it appear one in the same. You see, if the truth wasn't there, no one would
[time=2628] fall for it, but so much of it is the truth that we fall prey to it. Their appearance will be
[time=2637] convincing. Their words will be convincing, but even more impressive than all of that,
[time=2645] look at verse 22. The ones who Jesus said, I don't even know you, they're going to respond,
[time=2651] oh Lord, you remember me. Don't you remember me? Lord, I prophesied in your name. These men and
[time=2659] these women are going to say, God, I predicted the future and it came true and I did it in your name.
[time=2665] What greater proof could there be that someone is a prophet of God than the gift of prophecy and it come true? I mean, if I could stand here today and tell you what is going to happen in the
[time=2678] world tomorrow and it comes to be true and it's not just some vague generality like your horoscope
[time=2684] in the newspaper, but it's something very specific, very precise and it comes true. That's convincing.
[time=2690] That's quite a performance, but they say not only that, God, you remember me. I cast out
[time=2698] demons in your name. Don't you remember God, this man was demon possessed and what could be a
[time=2706] greater proof positive that someone belongs to God than them to walk up to a person who's demon possessed and say in the name of Jesus come out and the demon flees from him, of course, that's got
[time=2717] to be a prophet of God. Or what about this one? Verse 22 and done many wondrous works.
[time=2729] Wondrous works is the word dunamos, which means power. God, we demonstrated supernatural power.
[time=2738] That's the word that's used in the gospels, the book of Acts, and in the epistles that
[time=2744] describes someone who can speak in tongues. God, we spoke in a foreign tongue. We had power.
[time=2752] God, don't you remember? We had this great auditorium and I said I saw someone with this
[time=2759] certain disease and all these people came forth and God, they were all healed. Don't you remember?
[time=2764] God, I had power.
[time=2770] Jesus said, I never knew you. Depart from me you workers of iniquity. Beloved, their performance
[time=2783] will be convincing. They will have every ability to convince us by their appearance,
[time=2798] by their words, and by their performance that they truly represent God. But don't be disheartened
[time=2807] as though that's something new. If you remember when Moses walked into the court of Pharaoh, Pharaoh says, why should I let these people go? They're serving me. I don't want to let them go.
[time=2818] Why should I let them go? Moses threw down his stick and his stick became a serpent.
[time=2826] Basically Pharaoh said, big deal. He called his magicians in. They took a stick. They threw the
[time=2832] stick down and their stick became a serpent. Jesus wasn't the first one to cast out demons.
[time=2842] Jesus admitted in Matthew 12 that the sons of Israel, prior to him, were casting out demons.
[time=2850] He didn't deny it. Simon the magician in the book of Acts possessed rare supernatural gifts
[time=2858] before he ever heard of Christ. Don't be sucked in.
[time=2865] And someone says, I saw a miracle. Be it a speaking in tongues, a supposed healing,
[time=2876] real or fictitious, or a gas tank being made full on a freeway. It doesn't prove anything.
[time=2882] If it proves anything, it proves this, that Satan is still and has always been capable of great
[time=2895] powers, of great deception, and he has always been an imitator of God. God gives his people
[time=2901] spiritual gifts. Satan gives his people spiritual gifts. As a matter of fact, in 2 Corinthians it
[time=2908] says that Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. It means he's going to appear to
[time=2915] be very good and he's going to imitate and he's going to duplicate God. Now please don't misunderstand
[time=2921] me. I'm not saying anyone who prophesies is of Satan. Anyone who speaks of tongues is of Satan.
[time=2928] That is not what I am saying at all. Not at all. We believe God heals today.
[time=2935] It's a joy for me to walk down the hallways of our school and occasionally peek into one of the elementary rooms. There's a little boy in there that's a reminder to me today that God can do anything. Because I was there when the doctor said this little boy isn't going to make it and if you're the praying type of people pray. I was there an hour later when he said, Rick, is it Wednesday? I'm going to church tonight. I believe God can heal. We believe God can still
[time=2961] do the miraculous today but just because somebody does the miraculous is not proof that they have represented God. They'll be convincing in their appearance, in their words and in their performance.
[time=2978] Well, how do you know? How do you support what is true without getting sucked into what is a lie?
[time=2986] Verse 16 through 19 tells a very simple formula. Jesus said, "Therefore, by their fruits,
[time=2998] you will know them. By their fruits, you will know them." A fine New Testament historian makes the
[time=3007] point that there were certain types of wild weeds that grew up in Israel that had a very small
[time=3018] dark berry and from any distance of more than a few feet, that wild weed that had a small dark
[time=3027] berry that was worthless looked amazingly like a cluster of grapes. And he said there was a
[time=3037] flowering thistle and the dark flower on this thistle looked amazingly like a fig.
[time=3045] But when you go and you examine the fruit, it became obvious that this was not a grape
[time=3055] and this was not a fig by examining fruit. I believe the Bible talks about two types of fruit.
[time=3063] The first fruit is the fruit of sound living. Philippians chapter 1 verse 17 says,
[time=3072] "As Paul prayed for the church of Philippi, that they might have the fruit of righteousness."
[time=3080] The fruit of righteousness. And so Paul also instructed the churches of Galatia that there
[time=3086] were fruit that represented the Spirit of God, love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness,
[time=3095] faith, long-suffering temperance. That the fruit of sound living is one of the greatest proofs
[time=3102] that someone belongs to God. You know, often, if not always, truth and time go hand in hand.
[time=3112] One of the greatest tests is the inspect fruit, the fruit of sound living.
[time=3117] Second fruit that the Bible speaks of represents a second test. This is the fruit of sound doctrine.
[time=3125] Paul wrote to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 2 verses 16 through 19, "To watch out for
[time=3134] two men, Hymenaeus and Alexander, because they made shipwreck the faith, because they didn't hold to the Word of God." 1 John chapter 4 verses 1 through 4 says, "Beloved believe not every spirit,
[time=3148] but test the spirits to see if they be from God or not from God. Every spirit that confesses
[time=3154] that Jesus Christ is coming the flesh is of God. Examine their doctrine and the very reference point
[time=3163] of a doctrinal examination should begin on what do they really teach about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3169] That's not the only point, that's the starting point. But examine the doctrine. Don't just listen to the words, examine the doctrine. In the few moments that are left for us today, let me just
[time=3182] summarize this with some very practical applications for us to remember. First of all, something we've said on Sunday nights bears repeating this morning. Too often someone says,
[time=3194] "You're so narrow. You've just said this guy's wrong and this guy's wrong, and the only guy you
[time=3200] think is right hawks is yourself." Now that's not what I think. There's a lot of people a lot smarter
[time=3207] than I am. But I do believe that truth by its very nature is narrow. And there's something
[time=3216] about our society that says, "Oh, let's be broad-minded. Let's be open. Let's embrace all doctrines." After all, all roads lead to God. No, they don't. No more than all roads lead to
[time=3226] Indianapolis. If you take I-69 north, you're going to be a long, long time before you get the
[time=3234] Indianapolis. Truth by its very nature is narrow. If you've got a mathematical formula on your
[time=3241] desk as an engineer, you're trying to work your way through. There are an infinite number of possible answers, but only one of them is right. Truth by its nature is very narrow.
[time=3251] And you and I love narrow-minded truth. Aren't you thankful when you go to a surgeon he doesn't say,
[time=3257] "Well, I'm an equal opportunity operator and I just take out any organ. You know, I just want to be fair. I know you're here to get your appendix out, but it's been a long time since I've removed a kidney. I think I'll do that." You know, that doesn't matter. Let's be broad-minded about the whole deal. We have four or five pilots in our congregation. I'm glad they're narrow-minded.
[time=3276] "Hello, this is your captain speaking. We're about to approach Fort Wayne, Indiana, and I'm tired of being so narrow as to land this craft on the runway." Washington Street downtown looks like a good spot. There's a right place to land an airplane,
[time=3296] and just about every other place is wrong. You see, truth by its nature is narrow.
[time=3301] The second practical application is so important as this. Just because something is spectacular
[time=3308] doesn't mean that it is spiritual. Just because something is spectacular doesn't mean that it's
[time=3315] spiritual. Someone's advertising great healings, great tongues doesn't mean it's spiritual just
[time=3323] because it's spectacular. These people had all the spectaculars, but they weren't spiritual.
[time=3328] Third practical application, perhaps the most important for us to really zero in on for our own
[time=3335] lives as this. This passage teaches us anything. It's this. "You and I can be mere professors of
[time=3342] Christ without being true possessors of Christ." We can know all the right verses. We can say all
[time=3348] the right things. We can show up at all the right places. We can place ourselves in the right service, but if we really haven't given our hearts to Christ, what we say and what we do doesn't mean anything. You may have sung in the choir, taught Sunday school, ushered, worked in the nursery,
[time=3364] are all of the above. You may be able to quote John 3, 16, and every other 3, 16 in the Bible.
[time=3371] But if you've never truly given your heart to Christ, you're simply a professor and not a possessor of Christ and they'll come a day when they'll look at you and they'll say, "I never knew you." A fourth and final practical application. Paul warned that in the end times
[time=3389] that people would gather teachers around them having itching ears. That's a cute little metaphor
[time=3395] way of saying they've got an ear that already knows what it wants to hear. And so they're listening to every different school thought they can till they hear the one that's saying what they wanted to hear and they say, "Aha, I finally embraced the truth." Be careful that you're not guilty of
[time=3412] having an itching ear. That you're not simply practicing selective reception, receiving only
[time=3419] what you want to hear and discarding what you don't want to hear. It's the greatest way you can fall prey to a false teacher. You know, there's a teacher who loves you, who will guide you,
[time=3430] who will live in your heart and give you direction. He's the Lord Jesus Christ. Have you given your
[time=3436] heart to Him? If not this morning, I pray that you will. Thank you for tuning in to the Bible
[time=3442] Hour today. You heard some glorious music from our special guests, the sounds of heritage, and the message from our pastor who spoke again from the Word of God. If as a result of today's
[time=3453] program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual life. I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now. Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the fact
[time=3465] that you send your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins. And today I sense a need for
[time=3471] Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of my sins. I ask you to come in
[time=3477] Jesus today. In your name I pray, Amen. When you make a decision such as that, will you
[time=3485] write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. Earlier today,
