[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=51] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=57] it's the Bible Hour. With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and
[time=63] soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks. Join us, won't you, for
[time=71] the Bible Hours.
[time=101] Now the fourth stands it together.
[time=116] (music)
[time=175] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=180] This morning we have as our joy of worshiping the name and the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=188] We've come together in this place to do that, and now our privilege is not only here to welcome you, but to say a word of welcome to our friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=198] This is a Sunday when our audience for the Bible Hour increases a great deal. The time just changed in the states of Michigan and Ohio. Many of those people have already been the church and their home for lunch, and today we thank you for allowing us to join you by way of television to sing praises and to worship the Lord together. It's our prayer today that
[time=218] through this time of study, of singing, and of praising God together, each of us would grow closer in our walk with the Lord Jesus Christ. He's given us life, life to build,
[time=229] upon the foundation of the solid rock of who He is. Our choir now ministers to us in songs singing of Christ are solid rock.
[time=255] We must then Jesus, but in Christ's verse. I do not trust us. We just pray for the Holy, the God Jesus, we. On Christ, as a solid rock, I say, oh, oh, the ground we seek.
[time=284] In turn, when darkness fills His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[time=304] In every heart and star we make, Thy anchor holds within the will, on Christ the solid rock, I say, oh, oh, the ground is
[time=330] singing sound. In all the world, there is light, it's a porty end of a new world. In all the world, the voice of His way, He ends all high on His way. When He shall come with the best of all, they are standing in the powerless King.
[time=360] In His mind, there is no love, God has to stand before His throne. On Christ, as a solid rock, I stand, oh, oh, the ground we seek, He stand, oh, oh, the Christ as a solid rock, I stand, oh, the ground we seek, He stand, oh, the ground we seek, He stand.
[time=383] Oh, Christ as a solid rock, I stand, oh, the ground we seek, He stand, oh, the ground we seek, He stand.
[time=417] Jesus Christ provides us with that sure foundation and the peace in the midst of the storm when we need Him.
[time=429] Let's continue on that theme as we sing together. Him number 402, like a river glorious, Him number 402.
[time=459] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=609] We're coming up to the vacation time of the year. When you take your vacation, you note the number of rivers and streams that you go over in your car or pass along, and every time you see a stream like that,
[time=627] sing a bit of like a river glorious and the fact that stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blessed, finding as He promised perfect peace and rest.
[time=638] Let's listen now to the ministry of Kathy Hawks that she sings for us at this time.
[time=645] [MUSIC]
[time=661] My days are filled with laughter. My heart has known your peace.
[time=672] I've traveled far, still I have far to go, 'cause in my heart there is a longing to look upon your face, where you are is where I want to be.
[time=697] You are my King. You are the Lamb, the Lamb of Judah, the seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only Son.
[time=722] You are the King of who I am.
[time=733] [MUSIC]
[time=740] Every road I travel down, you have walked before me, made the light to shine out of darkness.
[time=755] I am looking for the day when I bow before you lay my crown at your feet.
[time=772] Oh, Jesus, you are my King. You are the Lamb, the Lion of Judah, the seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only Son.
[time=800] You are the King of who I am. You are my King.
[time=813] You are the Lamb, the Lion of Judah, the seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only Son.
[time=832] You are the King of who I am. You are the King of who I am.
[time=849] [MUSIC]
[time=864] Thank you, Kathy. It's our privilege once again to focus your attention to the Christian school as we conclude this month's activities.
[time=872] Today, I have brought with me a very special person, someone I love, someone that has supported me tremendously and taught me a lot here at the school.
[time=879] Ayita Tofflow is our elementary coordinator. I have asked her to come and share a few things with you.
[time=884] She has been here since the school started in 1973. She and Happy Walts are the only two teachers still here from that time.
[time=892] And I would like to ask you, Ayita, what just transpired in the beginning of the school here at Black Hawk?
[time=898] In order to do that, Steve, I would have to take you back to September 1, 1973. That was a Labor Day.
[time=905] And that was the day before school was to start. There were four teachers, two part-time, two full-time teachers, Pastor Jeremiah.
[time=914] We met in a room. We were going to be there to pray and talk about what was going to happen the next day.
[time=919] And it was on that day, at that specific time, that it really hit me. I finally realized what I'd done.
[time=927] I left a secure job and had come to teach in a place where there were four walls and a floor.
[time=934] And I thought I had left it all behind me. And when that hit, the tears flooded the room.
[time=941] And those of you that know me know that that isn't hard for me to do.
[time=945] But it was a really super time because we prayed. We talked a lot. We cried a lot.
[time=951] But finally, I realized that this was a real commitment. I had said, folks, that I would never teach in a Christian school.
[time=958] And probably there are a lot of you out there that maybe have said, "I will never send my kids to a Christian school."
[time=964] That's the position that I was in. And we left that room that day. I went to my room. I had an apron on.
[time=971] And everything that I possessed, I thought, wasn't that apron. And in that room.
[time=976] And I got into that room and got the room ready. And oh, how the Lord blessed, just in that day.
[time=983] And then the anticipation of the next day when the kids were coming. We started with 33 kids in our school.
[time=989] And I think with 39. And by the way, one of those charter student members of our school will be graduating this year.
[time=997] And I don't know whether Steve's in this service or not. But we're really proud that one of our students has gone all the way through in 12 years.
[time=1004] There have been a few changes since that time, though, I think. And I'd like for you to share with them some things that you've seen that have changed.
[time=1011] In Zechariah 4.10, it says that we should not despise the day of small beginnings.
[time=1017] And, you know, back there on that beginning day, it was a little bit hard for some of us who had left a nice plus job with lots of kids
[time=1026] to think about that. But, you know, the Lord blessed, excuse me, and in the ensuing years, we certainly have a lot more students.
[time=1033] We certainly have a lot more equipment. We certainly have a lot more as far as facilities.
[time=1039] But the one thing that has remained firm from that beginning day is the Word of God that has never changed.
[time=1046] And our position in knowing that that was going to be the foundation of our school, that has been the same all the way through.
[time=1053] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=1056] You know, that is the truth. And as we continue to apply the Word of God and its consistency in our school,
[time=1062] I'm sure that we'll be successful in training up our children in the way they should go.
[time=1066] It is a representative of the fine quality staff that we have here.
[time=1070] She's a tremendous teacher and a fine elementary coordinator.
[time=1073] And I'm grateful to her for what she's done for me and for our school.
[time=1076] Is there anything else that you'd like to say as you close?
[time=1079] Yes, there is. This is a mutual admiration society.
[time=1082] I dearly love this man. He has taught me a lot.
[time=1086] We just need to thank the Lord that he's here, guiding our school.
[time=1090] He's a man of integrity. He's a man of the Word of God's Word.
[time=1094] And I just praise the Lord that I have the privilege of working with Steve Longbrake.
[time=1098] And when he says, "Is there anything else you'd like to say that's dangerous ground?" I do believe in Christian education. And I know that a lot of you out there do because you have committed your children to our school.
[time=1113] We love your kids. One of the goals that I had set out in starting a Christian school was that,
[time=1122] especially in my own classroom, I would want my children to make Christianity a true way of life,
[time=1129] that it wasn't just going to be something they would put on and take off on Sunday.
[time=1133] But they were going to learn that God's Word worked no matter where they were, what day of the week it was. That was one of the true goals that I had.
[time=1141] I think we can say the purpose of education is to prepare our children for life.
[time=1146] But what I've come to know and to learn in a Christian school is the purpose of Christian education
[time=1152] is to train our children not only to prepare them for life, but to prepare them for eternity.
[time=1158] And that's why we're here. I would like to invite you, if you're interested in our school, if you even had a thought about what goes on, maybe you don't even have kids that would qualify for our school.
[time=1169] Maybe your grandparents, we'd love to have you come and visit Black Hawk Christian School anytime through the week.
[time=1174] We love to have visitors. I think most of us have an open door policy.
[time=1178] And that means we'd love to have you come in and visit with us at any time.
[time=1182] Thank you.
[time=1186] Our third grade class is coming now. They've been preparing for
[time=1192] during this school year to present Romans chapter 12.
[time=1196] They did that at Super 60s a few weeks ago. I saw that and asked Mrs. Johnson
[time=1202] if she would be willing to prepare them to do it for us here in church as well.
[time=1206] They're a fine group of young people. I'm proud to have them in our school.
[time=1210] I'm especially proud to hear them communicate the Word of God to you and to me, our third graders.
[time=1218] Romans chapter 12.
[time=1222] Therefore, I urge your brothers to be of God's mercy to offer your body sex living sacrifices only in pleasing to God which is your spiritual version.
[time=1234] Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this code but be transformed by the unity of your mind.
[time=1242] Then you'll be able to set up and approve for as well as it is.
[time=1246] It's good, pleasing and perfect, but by the grace given me I say to everyone of you, do not think of yourself more highly than you are.
[time=1254] But rather think of yourself with sober judgment in according to the measure of faith God has given you.
[time=1262] Just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function.
[time=1270] So in fact, you are ready for one body and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If the man's gift is prophesied let him use him in proportion to his faith.
[time=1286] If it is serving that he serve, it is teaching that he can teach it is encouraging when encouraged. If it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously.
[time=1298] If it is leadership, let him govern diligently.
[time=1302] If it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
[time=1306] Love must be sincere, hey what is evil, cling to what is good.
[time=1310] See devoted to one another, incredibly love.
[time=1314] Honor one another above yourselves. Never be backing and sealed, but keep your spiritual purpose searching alone.
[time=1322] Joyful in hope, Haitian in affliction, hateful in prayer, share with God's people who are in need, practice hospitality, bless those who persevere view, bless who do not curse,
[time=1336] rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn.
[time=1340] Live in harmony with one another, do not be proud of being willing to associate with people of love position, do not be conceited, do not relay anyone evil for evil, but be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible as far as it depends on you, live that peace with everyone.
[time=1364] Do not take revenge my friends, but believe through the last act, for it is written, it is mine to a bench I will repay says the Lord.
[time=1376] Honor contrary, it is your enemy of some repeat and to be associated with something to drink, and doing this he will eat burning calls on his head. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[time=1392] Romans chapter 12.
[time=1402] We've taken these few moments away from our morning worship service, while the announcements and offering are going on here, we wanted to announce some special activities coming up in the life of our church that we want to include you in.
[time=1418] Pete tonight starts that off. Yes, Rick, we have special guests right from our hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana. The Fort Wayne Bible College Corral will be with us for a concert at 6 p.m. tonight.
[time=1430] They're directed by Dr. J. Plattie and Scott Schindler, who has been an intern in our church for the last year, is a member of that corral.
[time=1438] We invite all of our viewers to come out tonight to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1442] We're located at 7321 East State Boulevard, and the time for the concert is 6 o'clock. Pete, I'm looking forward to that because we as a ministry so much appreciate Fort Wayne Bible College. A number of our students have gone there. We've gotten some of their students here. We think so much of that fine school and also their ministry through radio with WBCL. They're such a partnership in this community and we're looking forward to their concert tonight and would love to have you come. If you do not have an evening service or haven't been attending church, may we encourage you to begin tonight and join us here at 6 o'clock and then next week's another special. We've been working for several weeks now, Rick, on Saturday afternoon with some 90 children, members of our children's choirs, and they're going to present a special musical on May 5th on Sunday evening. The musical, Rick, is called Salty's Sing-along-a-thon, Mira-natha Mira-thon, Hallelujah, Jubilee.
[time=1498] And believe me, it took us a little while to get 90 kids to say that and to sing it.
[time=1502] But it's an exciting time as they make us laugh and yet they have some very poignant facts and good content to the musical for May 5th.
[time=1510] Well, I'm really proud of you to have gotten that title down. I didn't even begin to attack that. That will be a delightful night as we see our children serve the Lord and yet at the same time minister to us a message in song. Well, today we also want to share this booklet with you called Comfort E, My People. And we'd love to send you a copy as a gift from us to you. A reminder that God's word is the reference point of our life, our foundation at every time, but particularly so in a time when we need comfort. A divorce, a teenager who's run away from home, a death of a loved one. There are many points in our life when we're in need of comfort, loss of a job, discouragement. This little pamphlet simply takes some key scriptures and addresses them to some of those areas of our life where we need comfort. We'd love to send you a copy of it if you would simply write to us today.
[time=1566] Our address is the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1572] 46815. Once again, our address is the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Well, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to say a special word of welcome to a group of people who are with us for six months out of the year. Because the time has changed in Ohio and Indiana, many of you have gone to church, you've worshiped the Lord, you've come home, and you're getting dinner ready, or you're sitting down around the dinner table, and you're also joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=1606] We want to welcome you today, and thank you for joining us.
[time=1610] Pete, as we go back, what do we look forward to? Rick, this has been a month where we've been emphasizing the Christian School, in particular, Black Hawk Christian School, and right now you'll be listening to the faculty sextet, a group of men, all of them teachers at our school, and they have a message to sing whatever you do, wherever you go, wherever you go, and whatever you say, praise the Lord. I'm looking forward to that. Thank you for joining us.
[time=1634] May God bless you as we worship together.
[time=1652] Whatever we do, wherever we go,
[time=1662] let's praise the Lord. When everything's going wrong,
[time=1668] just sing a song and praise the Lord.
[time=1672] For Jesus knows our troubles, our needs he satisfies, whatever we do, wherever we go, let's
[time=1684] praise the Lord. Whenever we're talking with our
[time=1690] friends, let's praise the Lord.
[time=1694] Whenever we're thinking by ourselves, let's
[time=1700] praise the Lord. For he is always with us.
[time=1706] He knows what's on our mind. So whether we're talking or
[time=1712] whether we're thinking, let's praise the Lord.
[time=1716] Whether we laugh or whether we cry, let's
[time=1722] praise the Lord. And even when say the sad goodbye, let's
[time=1730] praise the Lord. For Jesus cares about us.
[time=1736] He's always at our side. So whether we're laughing or whether
[time=1742] we're crying, let's praise the Lord.
[time=1746] Whether it's rain on the sun is shining, let's
[time=1752] praise the Lord. Whether we're feeling blue or feeling
[time=1758] good, let's praise the Lord. For he is always ready to
[time=1766] take that blue away. So whether we're up or whether we're
[time=1772] down, let's praise the Lord. So whether we're laughing or
[time=1778] whether we're crying, let's praise the Lord.
[time=1784] So whether we're talking or whether we're thinking, let's praise the Lord. Wherever we do, wherever we go, let's
[time=1796] praise the Lord. Wherever we do, wherever we go, let's
[time=1802] praise the Lord.
[time=1818] Thank you men. They're not musicians, that's not a new group that we have formed. That was the male faculty of Black Car Christian School, not all of them, but a good part of them and they've done a fine job singing. They even do a finer job. Is a finer word, isn't it? A more fine job. They do a real good job teaching.
[time=1840] They really do. I need to get with our English teacher and get straightened out a little bit. We ask them to sing just as a way of visualizing for you the men that we have teaching and their commitment to serving the Lord here in this place. We're thankful today for your commitment to worshiping him. Let us open up our hearts to him before we open up his word. Our God and our Father today, we thank you for your word. We thank you that it is food for our soul, that it is a reference point for our thinking, that it is a foundation for our living. God, we love you and we've come to worship you. My own heart has been captured by a song that speaks of the majesty of who you are, that you are the king. You are the lamb.
[time=1887] Father, we find it so easy today to accept you as our lamb, that the Lord Jesus died for our sins and we found forgiveness. But God, we find it so challenging to accept you as our king, the one who rules us day in and day out.
[time=1903] God, draw us through your word to yourself, that we might live for you. That's the prayer for my heart and for this body. God, as we open your word, we're so dependent upon you, we would just pray that you would encourage hearts today, most of all those who've lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=1923] We think of the Eppley family and the meekses and the loss of their loved one a few weeks ago. And then today our hearts hurt for Mike Rodrick and his family and the loss of his father through cancer. God, we would pray that you would comfort their hearts even today in the valley. Father, we often think of those who hurt and feel so inadequate and yet we trust in you to be the God of all comfort. We ask you to minister to them.
[time=1955] Father, we pray for others today whose hurts are deep, they're long, who've been fighting a battle for a long time.
[time=1963] We think of the dables and Mary and Joyce.
[time=1967] We think of Clay's cocks.
[time=1971] We think of families that have been fractured and torn apart.
[time=1975] God, we pray that you will help hearts to stop blaming and finger pointing and to begin forgiving. We pray that you would be a rebuilder. Father, today, we pray for the one whose own heart is divided within them, who has emotional struggles. God, minister to them and to their families as they wait. God be a healer, we pray.
[time=1999] Father, you've given us life and we want it to be for your glory and so today through your word we ask you to challenge us in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=2011] William Borden had just graduated from Yale University. He was a man of great financial means. He was a man of academic achievement.
[time=2023] Opportunities in life for William Borden were numerous.
[time=2027] Much to the disappointment and contrary to the advice of his family and friends, William Borden gave his life to becoming a missionary in China. He was constantly reminded by his peers of all that was before him here in this country and how he could still be here and serve the Lord, but Borden refused knowing that was not God's plan for his life. He set out on a voyage generations ago to China.
[time=2055] His voyage would take him by traveling east.
[time=2059] Stopping in many countries, one of them was Egypt.
[time=2063] While in Egypt he contracted a rare very deadly disease. It was there recuperating but his recovery did not come about.
[time=2075] It became apparent to everyone that he would soon die and has reviewed his very short life.
[time=2083] The suggestions that he stay in this country, that he not go to China, he reviewed his life and said these words "No reserve, no retreat, no regrets."
[time=2099] "No reserve, no retreat, no regrets."
[time=2107] When our life comes to an end, be it today, be it 50, 60 more years, will we be able to say, "No reserve." I didn't hold back for a better time.
[time=2123] I used what God gave me, no retreat.
[time=2127] I didn't turn back, no regrets.
[time=2131] There's anything that I desire for each of our lives is that when each day ends and when each month ends and yes when life ends, we'll be in a position to say, "No regrets, no regrets." How does one live such a life on what foundation do you build? Open your Bibles with me if you will and we'll study what Jesus said about building a foundation for our lives. Matthew chapter 7 verses 24 through 27. The words of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as he says these words we begin with a little word therefore. That therefore tells us Jesus is reflecting on what he has previously said and bringing it to a conclusion. He's reflecting on the entirety of what you and I call the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2187] Therefore, whosoever hear these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man that built his house upon a rock.
[time=2207] And the rain descended and the floods came and the wind blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock.
[time=2227] And everyone that hearth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
[time=2243] And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell.
[time=2255] And great was the fall thereof. What did Jesus say about building our lives? Jesus had an excellent reference point for speaking with an analogy of construction in building for he was a carpenter. No doubt as a carpenter he had built homes and he knew where to build a house and where not to build a house.
[time=2279] He knew how to build a house with a secure foundation. And so he uses that as an analogy for our lives.
[time=2287] And in that analogy he selects the metaphor of a foundation.
[time=2291] And he makes a contrast between a foundation that is of rock and a foundation that is of sand. In Israel they do not have four seasons as distinct as we do. They have two very very distinct seasons. Not winter and summer so much as the wet season and the dry season.
[time=2315] In the wet season the rains come and they come strong. They tumble down the hills of Judea filling the streams to flood proportion and rushing through very wide river beds that are called watties W-A-D-I, a wattie. But during the dry season that wattie is dry.
[time=2339] And the land around it is some of the best land because it's low because there's a water supply near it's grassy. And it becomes a very attractive place for people to move to build. And there were those who were so foolish as to build their house upon the sands of the wattie during the dry season. Look like good ground.
[time=2363] Surprise, no one else has picked it out yet.
[time=2367] Must be our day. We'll build right here.
[time=2371] They'd build a house. Beautiful. Expensive.
[time=2375] Functional. Worked great during the dry season. Then the rains would come. And the rains would come down.
[time=2387] And the floods would come up.
[time=2391] And the wind would blow.
[time=2395] And all three of them met on that house.
[time=2399] And it fell. She said, in contrast, a wise man builds his house upon a solid foundation. Preferably rock. You can't make a better foundation than are now than the foundation of natural rock. The wiser man would move up the mountain a little bit. Oh, it'd be more difficult. Getting materials up there. Always having to come down to the lower points to draw water.
[time=2427] It had disadvantages, but when the rains came and the floods came and the winds came your investment would stand. You and I have been given a life and we're investing it. We're living it. We're spending it.
[time=2443] And the question that Jesus draws is on what are we building our lives? What is the foundation? Throughout the scriptures Jesus himself is often described as the foundation or the cornerstone.
[time=2459] In Isaiah, the Old Testament speaking prophetically in verses 16 and 17 of chapter 28 looks at Christ coming and calls him the rock.
[time=2471] Jesus said to Peter, Peter, who do you think that I am?
[time=2475] And Peter said, you're the Christ, the son of the living God and Jesus said that's right and upon that rock of who I am, I will build my church. Jesus is the rock.
[time=2487] Acts chapter 4 verse 11, Peter says, he is the rock that has been a rock of offense, a stone of stumbling, but God has selected him and made him the cornerstone, the first one that is placed in the line.
[time=2503] So says Peter again and first Peter. Christ is continually the rock and he is the rock and so the writer sings. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand.
[time=2515] Rock of ages cleft for me. Let me hide myself in thee. Remember as a child Jesus is the rock of my salvation. I won't sing anymore. Remember that song?
[time=2527] Concept that Christ is the very rock of life.
[time=2531] But Jesus is going to take that analogy and he's going to change it just a little bit. For it is not Christ in this passage who is the rock. It is what Christ said, Christ teaching and our obedience.
[time=2547] Notice Jesus therefore, therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine. He's been giving them the longest recorded sermon in the scriptures. Three chapters along here in Matthew 5, 6 and 7, he took him up to a mountain and gave him a sermon.
[time=2563] Hence it's called the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2567] And Jesus has said it all now. He's talked about every dimension of life as though it seemed. He talked about marriage. He talked about morality. He talked about giving. He talked about being kind. He talked about being merciful. He talked about being forgiving. He talked about being a peacemaker. He talked about entering a narrow gate. He talked about true and false teachers. He talked about judging. He talked about fasting. He talked about praying. He talked about it all. And this is though each one of those subjects were bricks.
[time=2599] And we can build those bricks into our lives.
[time=2603] But the very foundation is himself in our obedience to him. The very foundation of life is hearing his word and doing his word. If our lives are going to be lived and built solidly, then they're going to have to be founded upon a solid foundation of first hearing God's word. Most of you know me fairly well.
[time=2631] And you know what my favorite sport is.
[time=2635] It's not football, although I love it, and swimming and golf.
[time=2639] My favorite sport is eating. It's an indoor sport or an outdoor sport. You can do it 12 months of year. It's never out of season.
[time=2647] And most evangelical Christians are known for what they don't do.
[time=2651] They don't drink cuz smoke or chew or run around with girls who do. But any time two or three are gathered in his name, there's food. Isn't that true?
[time=2659] I mean we eat and I love to eat.
[time=2663] Now I would like to suggest something that each of us do.
[time=2667] Let's amend our habits of overeating. Let's correct it today and let us all pledge together that we are no longer going to overeat.
[time=2675] We're not going to eat three meals a day plus a snack between each meal and a snack between each snack. We're going to make this new plan.
[time=2683] We're going to eat one meal a week.
[time=2687] Any takers?
[time=2691] You've had some bad ideas, but that may head to list. One meal week, we couldn't even live off one meal a week. If we didn't supplement that with something during the other six days, we would die. You cannot live on one meal week and I'd say you're absolutely right.
[time=2707] Why are you trying to do it spiritually?
[time=2711] There will be over 1,300 people here today.
[time=2715] And the vast, vast, vast majority of us have determined that we are going to feed ourselves spiritually one meal week and we will settle for second-hand leftovers from somebody else.
[time=2731] We won't even go out and get it for ourselves. We'll let somebody else speed feed us whatever they like and they think we need.
[time=2739] And many of us are dying.
[time=2747] A very clear death of spiritual malnutrition because we're trying to sustain life with all of its intensity, with all of its pressure on one meal a week.
[time=2763] You say, "Well, it's an hour-long meal." No, it's not.
[time=2767] If I preach for an hour, you die.
[time=2771] Twenty minutes.
[time=2775] Maybe 30 on a long Sunday.
[time=2779] One meal week.
[time=2783] Do you know that over 400 people will come to this church today and come to the morning worship service, but they won't even feed themselves a little extra called Sunday School?
[time=2795] You know, we say, "Well, you know, Sunday, that is the Lord's day." And we've come, but it's not convenient to stay for two hours.
[time=2803] There will be 1,300 plus people here today.
[time=2807] They'll probably be barely 900 in Sunday School.
[time=2811] There are so many opportunities.
[time=2815] For us to hear God's Word when we neglect it.
[time=2819] There's not only this worship service in Sunday School, but there's a Sunday evening service. We do a variety of things, but part of that is to teach God's Word. We have a Wednesday night service. It's primarily a night of service, but there are two Bible studies. There are home Bible studies.
[time=2835] There's Bible study fellowship that even meets in our facilities.
[time=2839] There are two Christian radio stations that can give us God's Word and we can hear it.
[time=2843] Do you know if you determined to do a personal Bible study today, that you could go to a Christian bookstore, and if you did one book a day, you would probably never get through the books that are available, just on Bible study alone in your life.
[time=2863] We hardly ever touch them.
[time=2867] Our growth and our steadfastness as a believer is a matter of personal hygiene and diet. And one meal weak will never cut it. Nothing will weaken the foundation more than an absence of hearing God's Word. It's crucial.
[time=2891] It's crucial. When Homer wrote the Odyssey, there was a time when the floods were beating against Odysseus, and a crewman looked at him and said, "There he stands like a rock." There he stands like a rock.
[time=2915] Virgilne is a need, plagiarized, and improved the line and said, "Like a rock and movable in the sea like a rock." He stands he.
[time=2927] How do you stand? The floods will come.
[time=2931] The rains will come, and the winds of life are going to blow against your body and mind, and they're going to beat against our life. And we will rise, or fall in proportion to the foundation on which we build our lives.
[time=2951] And phase one of it is hearing. Phase two, notice Jesus really put the emphasis not so much on hearing as much as doing.
[time=2959] He says, "Who hears my word and does them." That's the one I'll liken to the rock. One of the deacons of our church said something to me that is stuck, and I'm glad that it has.
[time=2971] He said, "God didn't give us His Word to increase our knowledge. He gave it to change our lives." Word to be obedient to God's Word.
[time=2983] During the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee sent a message to one of his chief commanders, Thomas Stonewall Jackson.
[time=2993] The message asked for Jackson to meet Lee at his headquarters at his earliest convenience. The message came to Jackson, he immediately mounted his horse in the middle of a tremendous blizzard and rode off to meet Lee. Lee was greatly surprised when Jackson came in the room and mentioned that he didn't mean for him to come immediately, but when it was convenient.
[time=3017] Jackson said, "General E. Schur, your slightest wish is this soldier's command." The slightest thing that God has indicated in His Word is for our obedience.
[time=3033] When General Montgomery took over the Allied forces in North Africa, they had been defeated and defeated time and time again. It didn't take him long to assess the problem. As an order was given from headquarters and sent out to leaders and then passed down to lieutenants, everyone took the liberty of mending the orders as he saw at best. A memo went out from Montgomery with this message.
[time=3061] Gentlemen, orders are no longer to be considered the basis of discussion, but the basis for action. What God has said in His Word is not intended to be the basis for our discussion, but for our action.
[time=3081] And I am amazed that how much happens in the name of counseling, and I'm all for counseling, that is not a basis for action, but people want to come together and they want to discuss alternatives to what God has said. As Tony Campolo put it, God didn't give us 10 suggestions.
[time=3101] He gave us 10 commandments.
[time=3105] Beloved, if there is an area of our lives that are not in total harmony with God's Word, counseling is not to discuss God's Word.
[time=3117] And is it applicable or not applicable?
[time=3121] Or can we somehow amend it? It's a basis for action.
[time=3125] And I can never remember a time, never,
[time=3131] that a person's life was shipwrecked, and they took God's Word seriously, and they obeyed it that their life wasn't corrected and rebuilt.
[time=3143] Because they took it as a basis for action, but you know, so few people do that. And it's usually not our mistakes that really causes the pain. It's how we handle our mistakes. God's Word is not negotiable. It's given to obey.
[time=3163] Remember Joshua 1-8, this book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but they shall meditate there in day and night that thou may observe to do according to all that's written therein.
[time=3175] Then thou shall make their way prospers, then thou shall have good success, that you may observe to do all.
[time=3183] It's not enough to hear it, and to meditate on it, you've got to obey it. Someone wrote these words from the reference point of our Savior. You call me master and obey me not.
[time=3199] You call me light and see me not.
[time=3203] You call me way and walk me not. You call me life and desire me not. You call me wise and follow me not.
[time=3215] You call me fair and love me not. You call me rich and ask me not. You call me eternal and seek me not. You call me noble and serve me not. You call me mighty and honor me not. You call me just and fear me not.
[time=3239] If I condemn you, blame me not.
[time=3247] A man, not meaning to be antagonistic at all, said I just read a book and it said, "Who are the three greatest people in the world?" He said, "Who do you think they said?" I said, "The Lord Jesus." Of course, he said, "I figured you'd say that, but this book said you're wrong." The book also said, "The Lord Jesus would have been the most influential person in history if his followers had truly obeyed him." If we had just truly obeyed him, what foundation do we build our lives on?
[time=3287] Christ said, "The wise man builds it on hearing and doing God's Word." There's a lot of ways in building a house you can make some shortcuts. Save a few bucks perhaps save a lot of time and it won't show either for a while for a while. Some of us have tried to save a few dollars, save a little time, take some shortcuts through life.
[time=3323] We've gotten away with it for a while for a while.
[time=3331] Let's try to tie this all together very quickly. First, a brief reminder.
[time=3335] A brief but important point.
[time=3339] Life with Christ is not exempt from storms.
[time=3343] Beloved, whatever you hear, be it on radio or TV or pulpit, don't ever believe it when someone says it's God's will that everybody be healthy and rich.
[time=3355] It's not true. Jesus said, "Whether we build our life on sand or the rock of who he is and what he said, we're still going to be exposed to the storms of life." Let me just boil this down to a few quick questions.
[time=3371] One, what are you building your life on?
[time=3375] What's your foundation? What are you building your life on? Two, what are you building on it?
[time=3383] You see, you can have Christ as your savior and build on him. Good?
[time=3391] Precious stone, gold, silver? Or you can build on him wood, hay and stubble?
[time=3399] Have you received Christ? That's the foundation.
[time=3403] If you have, what are you building on top of it? You know, changing foundations isn't easy. Are you willing to do that? Carl Sandberg said, "Beat me, O Lord, for me into a crowbar. Use me, O God, to pry loose old foundations. Put in new."
[time=3425] If your life's not founded on Christ today, I pray that you'll allow him to beat on you with his spirit, to form a crowbar and to pry loose old foundations.
[time=3437] It may hurt, it may cost you, but now you can build it.
[time=3441] Thank you so much for joining us today.
[time=3443] The music and the message from the Word of God by our pastor Rick Hawks has carried the theme "Building Your Life on a Sure Foundation." If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your walk with Jesus Christ, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now. Will you pray with me?
[time=3463] Dear Heavenly Father, I want to thank you today for what I heard in this service. And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sin.
[time=3475] I ask you to come in, dear Lord, and to forgive me and to come into my heart today, in Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3485] We're always encouraged when you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3489] And when you write us, after you've written, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
