[time=53] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=57] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=63] it's the Bible Hour.
[time=65] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=75] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=80] [singing]
[time=101] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=106] Thank you, Ron, for your fine song leading, and you for your fine singing this morning.
[time=111] We've come together to praise and to worship the Lord, and what better way than to take our hearts and our voices and to sing praises to His name.
[time=120] The last hour in our first morning worship service, it was such a joy to hear from our bell choir and from Black Hawk Christian School Choir, and we're looking forward to hearing from them again today.
[time=131] We want to welcome also our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=135] We're praying that God will use this hour in each of our lives to comfort us, to strengthen us, and to build our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=143] Ron Hackett is leading our choir this morning and our congregational singing, filling in for Pete Coby.
[time=150] We want to ask you to be praying for Pete and for his family.
[time=154] On Friday, they receive some very tragic news that Pete's sister's son, Pete's nephew, a 13-year-old little boy by the name of Harold, standing at an intersection waiting to cross the street with some friends, and a motorcyclist went out of control, slid on the bike, and hit their nephew Harold, and he was killed.
[time=174] And so this morning, Pete is right now on a flight from here to California to stand with his family and pray that the Word of God would be faithful and true, that God would walk with them through the valley of the shadow of death and bring comfort to their hearts.
[time=190] Let us pray for them at this time.
[time=192] Our God and our Father, we today each sigh with a sense of pain.
[time=197] There comes their own thoughts.
[time=201] What if it were our son, or our nephew, or our loved one?
[time=206] Oh God, the pain of their hearts is far greater than our own comprehension.
[time=211] But yet Father, you've lost your loved one, your son, you saw him die.
[time=216] God is the God of all comfort we ask you to comfort their hearts.
[time=220] You pray that you'll give Pete the ability to deal with his own grief
[time=226] and yet be a support to a family.
[time=229] We pray for Carol and Peter and Andy and Lisa while they're here in the loneliness of their heart and sorrow, most of all for the young boy's parents who have had the love of their life taken away prematurely.
[time=243] Father, we pray for others who this reopens their hearth because they had lost children.
[time=249] God comfort them as they go through the flashback of sorrow.
[time=253] We pray that you'll be with those members of this fellowship, those who listen by way of television who've lost loved ones in recent days, for the families of Harold Roderick, for the families of Alberta Genna.
[time=268] God, we ask you to comfort them.
[time=270] We ask you today through your word to build our lives and to strengthen us.
[time=275] Father, we pray today that through this service that we would see Jesus and hope would fill our lives and we would never be the same,
[time=286] for it's in Christ's name that we pray. Amen.
[time=291] Now it's our privilege to listen to the ministry of our handbell choir as Scott Schindler directs them.
[time=305] [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=456] Thank you ladies and Scott for that number.
[time=458] We appreciate it greatly.
[time=459] Let's turn now on our hymnal's to number 192.
[time=463] One day when heaven was filled with his brightness, one day that Lord is going to come back for us as his people.
[time=470] Shall we stand as we sing the number 192, standing as we sing?
[time=475] [MUSIC - 112 seconds]
[time=595] - Thank you for that fine singing, you may be seated.
[time=598] (piano music)
[time=613] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=788] (audience applauds)
[time=797] (gentle piano music)
[time=817] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=888] - How many times Lord have troubles brought me down
[time=897] to my knees over this time?
[time=901] [MUSIC]
[time=906] - You see, I really have no selfish motive in mind.
[time=915] I just want to thank you Lord, for all of the other times.
[time=919] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=969] - Again, I want to thank you for joining us today
[time=980] for the Bible Hour.
[time=982] Each Sunday morning before our worship services begin, we record just a few minutes to share with you at this time while some other things are going on in our church service, some announcements and our offering.
[time=994] That gives us a chance just to talk with you directly who join us for television.
[time=1000] Today, I'm so saddened to be here by my selfish, Pete Coby is on his way to California right now.
[time=1007] And we'd be asking you to pray for Pete.
[time=1010] Friday night, very late, he received the tragic news that his 13 year old nephew was killed when a motorcyclist ran out of control and hid him as he was on the sidewalk.
[time=1021] And we would ask you to be praying for Pete's family that God, the God of all comfort would comfort them.
[time=1028] So today, we're here worshiping the Lord, trusting him to comfort the Coby's heart.
[time=1034] And yet at the same time, I'm aware of the fact that very many of you today also have a burden of heart.
[time=1040] And we're trusting God to comfort you as well.
[time=1043] Thank you for joining us today, and we do pray that God will use this hour to strengthen each one of us and our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1052] Tonight is a very special evening for our church and the children of our church.
[time=1057] Tonight's evening service is given over to a children's musical concert.
[time=1061] There'll be about a 40 minute production from our first through six graders.
[time=1065] They've been working all year long on it.
[time=1068] It's called Salty's Sing Along Hallelujah Marathon.
[time=1072] And we want to encourage you, if you do not have an evening service at your church or you do not attend church, then join us tonight to see our children's musical.
[time=1080] And then I'll have the privilege of giving a message at the end of that out of Matthew chapter seven, ask and it shall be given.
[time=1087] We'd love to see you here tonight at Black Hawk, Baptist Church at six o'clock.
[time=1093] This month of May is the month that we traditionally celebrate Mother's Day.
[time=1098] And I don't think that it is possible for us to do too much to honor mothers.
[time=1103] Mothers have an unenviable job.
[time=1105] There's an old adage that says a man's work is from son to son, but a woman's work is never done.
[time=1112] And how true that is.
[time=1113] I was just thinking last night of how my week came to an end and Saturday was a day off.
[time=1119] But Kathy still had three children who expected breakfast first thing in the morning, snacks before she could get it cleaned up, lunch before that was done, and that goes on and on and on.
[time=1130] Well, I try to be a good father and husband in sharing that, but most of it comes her way.
[time=1135] And a woman has tremendous influence as a mother.
[time=1139] Jim Dobson, a focus on the family ministry, is made available a pamphlet, and he's made it available to us so that we can share it with you.
[time=1146] It's called a woman of influence.
[time=1149] And many of you may be suffering under the burden of motherhood, and you see all those little fingers that leave fingerprints everywhere, little muddy feet that track it in on the cleanest room of the house, and the weight of all the roles of a mother come down on you and say, what difference does it make?
[time=1169] Well, this helpful pamphlet is something we want to send to you called a woman of influence.
[time=1175] It identifies the scriptural values of being a mother and how valuable that is in the life of your home and of your family.
[time=1183] We want to send it to you as an encouragement during this month of May when we celebrate Mother's Day.
[time=1188] If you'll simply write to us today, we would love to send you a copy.
[time=1193] Write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1202] Once again, our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1211] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1216] We'll get in here from our Black Hawk Christian School High School Choir as they minister to us in song just before we study the scriptures.
[time=1224] Thank you for joining us today.

[time=3431] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=3436] And if, as a result of today's broadcast, you sense a need in your life to know Jesus Christ personally.
[time=3443] We'd like to invite you to invite him into your heart right now.
[time=3447] Won't you join us in prayer?
[time=3450] Dear Heavenly Father, today we thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, and that He has died for our sins.
[time=3460] And I ask you to come into my heart, and forgive me of my sins, and give me eternal life.
[time=3469] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3474] If today you made that decision, and you prayed along with me to invite Christ into your heart,
[time=3480] that is the most significant decision you'll make in your life.
[time=3483] You have just invited the Son of God into your heart.
[time=3486] And we want to send you this helpful booklet entitled "Your Decision." It reflects the fact that you have just now decided to ask Christ into your heart.
[time=3495] If you'll write to us, we'll send it to you immediately.
[time=3498] Then, earlier in today's broadcast, we also offered you a pamphlet entitled "A Woman of Influence."
[time=3504] For either of these pamphlets, simply write to us at the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3515] If you would like to receive a cassette copy of today's sermon, simply write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=3527] To identify today's sermon as the one you would like to receive, use number 1185.
[time=3534] Please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3541] The Bible Hour has been made possible by members of the Founders Club.
[time=3555] A group of committed Christians who regularly support this outreach ministry.
