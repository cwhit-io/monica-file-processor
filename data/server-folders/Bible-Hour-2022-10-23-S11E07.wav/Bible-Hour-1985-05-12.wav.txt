[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=60] >> Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=82] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=88] it's the Bible Hour.
[time=90] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message
[time=97] from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=101] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=109] >> Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=121] It is a joy for us today to welcome you to our second morning of worship here, our second
[time=127] service today.
[time=128] In our first hour, we had an overflow crowd as many have gathered for as families to come and to worship today as it is Mother's Day, and even as we look out across the auditorium today we see friends and family members who have driven to be back here in Fort Wayne to celebrate Mother's Day together.
[time=145] We're delighted that each of you have come, and also want to say a special word of welcome to our many friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Each week it is our privilege to come into hospital rooms, prisons, homes, senior citizens complexes, and by the means of television, declare the Word of God.
[time=163] This morning we know on Mother's Day that many people are at different churches, but the point of our lives is that whether we're here, or whether we're at a different church, we're to worship the Lord Jesus Christ, to lift up His name and to exalt Him.
[time=177] Paul said in the book of Philippians the second chapter that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father, that we're to exalt Him, that we're to lift up His name and to praise Him.
[time=191] Our prayer is going to sing a great majestic anthem of praise entitled "Exultation."
[time=221] The pews rejoice in all that he has been, and let them sing among the nations, by God's
[time=228] freedom.
[time=229] As a King of the love, love is one of forever and ever.
[time=236] I say unto my own, sing unto my own, live unto my own.
[time=261] Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice, and let them sing among the nations, by God's
[time=278] honour, and let them sing among the nations, by God's freedom, and let them sing among
[time=293] the nations, by God's freedom, and let them sing among the nations, by God's freedom,
[time=301] and let them sing among the nations, by God's freedom, and let them sing among the nations.
[time=326] Praise God in His sanctuary, praise God in the firmament of His power.
[time=330] The privilege we have to sing praises to our Lord.
[time=334] Let's listen to the ministry and song now of Kathy Hawks as she sings for us a song entitled "We Must Love Them While We Can."
[time=347] You know the most fondest memory on this very special Mother's Day that I have is a memory of seeing around the dinner table one October evening, and my parents shared with me how I could know Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=360] You know that was the best thing they've ever done for me, and they've done just about everything for me.
[time=367] The tide my shoes took me to school, and patched a worn out jeans.
[time=379] They sued our tears and called our fears, and listened to our dreams.
[time=391] Somewhere along their golden heels, their hair has lost its shape.
[time=402] The notes to hear them one hundred tea would crackle when they sing.
[time=414] But now they're all alone, no children's voices to fill their empty halls.
[time=432] We must love them while we can.
[time=454] Our time just seems to hurry by, and the day's slipping to ease, and the moments that we've
[time=470] had will disappear, so love them while we can.
[time=484] The folks that taught us our first words still have much to say.
[time=503] The silver secrets of their words lie beneath those crowns of grace.
[time=515] As they approach the end, we've changed our rules from children to best friends.
[time=532] We must love them while we can.
[time=542] Our time just seems to hurry by, and the day's slipping to ease, and the moments that we've
[time=571] had will disappear, so love them while we can.
[time=587] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=614] Today is a very special day as we celebrate Mother's Day, and we honor the mothers, the
[time=620] women, the wives of our church for their godly influence and their hard labor.
[time=624] So this is a very special day, and we want to pass on a word of recognition and appreciation to you friends who are watching us and who are mothers, and trust that God will encourage
[time=635] your heart and your family will encourage your heart as well on this very special day.
[time=640] Rick, we have a great deal of mothers in our church, and just to go down by the nursery area reminds us of the loving mothers that we have and the children that we have and I, too, am thankful for the mothers that we have in our church.
[time=652] I received a letter this week from Dewey and Alice Marsden.
[time=657] They're regular viewers of the Bible Hour, and they live in Grace Village in Winona Lake, Indiana.
[time=662] Rick, they're celebrating this week their 65th wedding anniversary.
[time=667] They were in my father's church many years ago and fellowshiped with him.
[time=670] They were married in 1920, and I met them not too long ago, and the privilege of seeing
[time=677] them and the walk that they've had with the Lord all those years is really just wonderful, and we just want to say congratulations to them today as they view the Bible Hour and
[time=688] wish them well in their 65th wedding anniversary.
[time=691] That is absolutely amazing, and that is exactly what we're talking about on Mother's Day, and that is the faithfulness and someone to be married and to honor each other and to love each other for 65 years.
[time=703] That is a testimony to this community, and we rejoice with them on their anniversary.
[time=709] For each of you who are watching, we have a pamphlet we want to share with you.
[time=713] To be honest, we have a flower here for the mothers who are here at our church today, but it's pretty tough to mail you a flower, so we have a pamphlet for you.
[time=721] If you would like one for yourself or for your mother or for a friend, we'd love to send you a copy of this helpful little pamphlet entitled "A Woman of Influence."
[time=733] Just this morning I was reading some brief biographies of men like G. Campbell Morgan and Charles Wesley and how influential their mother was in their life.
[time=742] The tremendous influence a mother has.
[time=745] This pamphlet was prepared for Dr. James Dobbs in a focus on the family ministries by Gene Fleming and Dr. Dobbson has made them available to us so that we can make them available to you.
[time=756] If you would like a copy, you simply need to write to us and we'll send it to you free in recognition of the month of May being the time when we celebrate Mother's Day.
[time=766] Simply write to us today, Pete will you tell our friends how they can do that.
[time=769] Yes, when you're requesting this pamphlet right to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne,
[time=775] Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=779] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=786] Thank you, Pete.
[time=787] You know, May is a very busy time on everyone's calendars and it certainly is on ours.
[time=793] On Sunday, May the 19th, here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church in our evening service, we are having the graduation commencement exercise for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=803] Over the last few weeks we've talked to you about Christian education because it's been a month of focusing on the ministry of Christian education here at Black Hawk and our commencement
[time=813] exercise is May the 19th at 6 o'clock p.m. and we'd love to have you come and be a part
[time=820] of that evening of celebration.
[time=822] 20-some seniors will be graduating, their parents will be recognized, will be challenged from God's Word and we'd love to have you as a part of it.
[time=830] Then the week following that, May the 25th and the 26th, we have a very special weekend as we're co-hosting a rally with WFCV, a fine Christian radio station here with a excellent
[time=842] speaker, encourager and challenger Dr. David Breeze, who you're more familiar with than I am.
[time=848] David Breeze many years ago was the director of the Garyland Youth for Christ and was familiar.
[time=853] We were familiar with him, had him in our home many times.
[time=855] I haven't seen him for years and I'm looking forward to his ministry.
[time=858] I've heard him on the radio and he's an outstanding evangelist, preacher, teacher and we look forward to having him here for that rally.
[time=865] Well he has been on radio a number of years with a ministry called Christian Destiny and he'll be here on Saturday, May the 25th for a rally on Saturday evening and then on Sunday
[time=876] morning he will be preaching here in both of our morning worship services and on the Bible hour and of course we want you to join us for every opportunity that you can.
[time=886] We're going to go back to our morning worship service now and we need to apologize to our friends in Fort Wayne.
[time=893] We're being preempted for a half hour of today's broadcast so at 1130 we'll part company for
[time=899] you friends here in Fort Wayne but we'll be back next week with a full hour.
[time=903] May God bless you today.
[time=921] [MUSIC - 89 seconds]
[time=1037] Thank you Dave and Debbie.
[time=1040] A musical question I am bound for the Promised Land.
[time=1044] Oh who will come and go with me?
[time=1047] That's the very question we would want to be first and foremost on your hearts.
[time=1052] On this day and every day are you bound for the Promised Land?
[time=1056] Do you know Christ is your Savior?
[time=1058] Have you been forgiven?
[time=1060] You know the certainty of a home in heaven.
[time=1062] In a moment Dave will come and minister to us again in song but this morning we would like to recognize the mothers who are in the auditorium.
[time=1070] On the tables in each side of the auditorium there are flowers that we have purchased as a way for our church to recognize our ladies.
[time=1078] The wives, the mothers, those who have put is their priority in life living a godly life in their home.
[time=1086] We thank God for the heritage in this church of women who have followed the example of Proverbs 31 and have made their value pleasing to the Lord.
[time=1095] That will be our text that we will study this morning in a few moments but we have those as gifts from our church to you.
[time=1102] In the past we have had the children come in out of Sunday school class and pass those out but then we realized we were putting a dirty wet dripping flower on your lap for the people in the first hour.
[time=1113] They had that for two hours to drag with them so they are here and we will let you pick out the color that you want until we get down until they are all the same color.
[time=1122] That way we can have a gift from us to you and a reminder around your home that the word of God says that you are worth as a wife and as a mother has great value.
[time=1133] Could I ask all of the mothers in our auditorium to stand right now that we could simply recognize them? If you are a mother today in this auditorium would you simply stand?
[time=1142] Good. All right. Let me pray with you while you stand. Our God and our Father we thank you for these lives that stand before us and stand before us day by day.
[time=1155] An example of your love and your tenderness, your hands and your heart so often Lord are reflected through their hands and hearts and we thank you for them.
[time=1165] We pray that you would give them energy for their endless task. We pray that you would give them a fulfillment and knowing that their work pleases you and their labor pleases you.
[time=1177] Father, we pray for those today whose hearts are heavy because their mother is not standing. She is sick or she is gone.
[time=1187] We pray for those who have lost their mothers in recent years and today is not a day of joy but it's a day of reminder of their hurt and their loss.
[time=1196] God, we ask you to comfort those. We pray for families who are fractured that today there is no reunion. God, we pray that you would bring healing in their lives and we pray that you would bring a spirit of forgiveness into each one.
[time=1210] But for the mothers, the wives today, God, we thank you for their labor and pray your blessing upon them. In Jesus name, amen.
[time=1221] There's the subtle reminder daily in life that we need the Lord. David Johnson is going to come back and play for us on his viola, the hymn "I Need the Every Hour." David Johnson.
[time=1240] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=1409] Thank you, David. Our father, we confess to you as the song did play. We need the every hour. Father, today, as we would come to worship you, we need you. For our lips cannot even utter fourth praise unless your spirit puts it in our heart and we need thee. Father, we need thee as we walk through the pains and the hurts of life.
[time=1438] We pray for Ray Stettler and Elmore McDonald. We pray for the Mailey family with their son so will. For Mary Lampman and Joyce Free and Harry Bennett and Catherine Northrop and others as they battle cancer. We pray for those whose hearts have grown weak. We need thee, Father. We pray for mothers today who today don't have little hands or little feet to love them back.
[time=1467] We pray for mothers who have lost children. God, on this day of joy for so many, but grief for them, comfort them, please. We need thee.
[time=1479] Father, we pray for that one today, a husband and a wife who love each other and love you and love children but whose home has not yet been blessed with children whose heart aches for that privilege. We need thee, Father.
[time=1495] Father, we pray today for families who have been torn apart by youth and children who have been disobedient. We pray for the family today whose child should be at home with their not and the whole and the heart and the hurt within. We need thee, Father.
[time=1518] We pray for families that are torn apart, husband and wife. We need thee, Father.
[time=1527] As we study your word to know it and to live it, Father, we need you. Father, today to walk godly has a challenge and we need you.
[time=1537] And to share the Lord Jesus Christ in a win some way today, Father, we need you. And so we ask you to minister to us this morning.
[time=1547] Because we need you. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1553] There's a constant talk about unemployment, shortages of job and underemployment, difficulty in securing and during employment, the whole job market seems to be still in a tight position.
[time=1576] And because of that, I wanted to do a little checking to see what jobs are available in today's market and I checked out the Help Wanted section.
[time=1585] I found at least a dozen different jobs that were available. One job that was available was as a purchasing agent for small commodities.
[time=1595] A second was a clothing designer for a high-fashion apparel. A third job that was available was as an importer of spices and exotic cuisine.
[time=1607] A fourth job was for a part-time cook at a restaurant specializing in customer-friendliness personal orders that was a part-time shift, working split shifts throughout the day.
[time=1620] A job was available as a real estate agent. A sixth job was available as a commodities broker. A seventh job was somewhat of a different job.
[time=1630] There was an opening for an aerobics instructor. There was a job that was very specialized, a combination CPA, financial advisor, and analyst was needed.
[time=1642] A ninth job was very particular. It was a personnel company looking for an experienced headhunter capable of grooming candidates for public office.
[time=1652] A tenth job was for an owner operator of a small manufacturing firm that would supply a retail chain.
[time=1660] A eleventh job was as a school guidance counselor. A final job was for an experienced office manager for a diversified firm, experienced, required in forecasting, as well as hands-on supervision.
[time=1676] Also desired were a good sense of humor, cost-saving mindset, and a polished professional.
[time=1683] I trust that you can see from this that there are quite a few jobs available today, but I must regret to inform you that all of these jobs have been filled.
[time=1693] And the amazing thing is that one person filled all 12 jobs. You say that's outstanding. That must be Superman. No, it was Wonder Woman.
[time=1704] These jobs that we have just described is exactly what Proverbs 31 says is "The Godly Woman."
[time=1713] I invite you to open your Bibles to the Book of Proverbs chapter 31, and as I read your faces, some of you are panic-stricken.
[time=1721] You couldn't believe he was going to speak on unemployment on Mother's Day.
[time=1727] Proverbs 31 and verses 10 through the end of the chapter outline qualities, abilities, and the jobs that are done by a Godly woman.
[time=1740] We tend to put those in very derogatory or best demeaning terms as cooking, cleaning, dishwashing, mending, darning socks.
[time=1753] Yet we could simply change some labels and give them a great deal of dignity and a great deal of honor.
[time=1759] Well, as I read Proverbs 31 a month ago in preparation, and as I worked through this in the preceding weeks, I discovered that there were two themes that I wanted to speak on.
[time=1769] One was the work of the Godly woman, and the second was the worth of the Godly woman.
[time=1776] Then I realized the day that I spoke on the worth of the Godly woman, the women would be liking the message, and the women would be approving, but the men would really be upset with me.
[time=1786] And the day that I spoke upon the work of the Godly woman, the women would then be upset with me.
[time=1792] Well, since it's Mother's Day, I decided to let the men be upset this week, the women to be upset next week, and then I'm going to Florida for two weeks.
[time=1802] No lack of courage on my part, purely coincidental.
[time=1808] Well, as we study this passage, I am amazed to discover how the language that we choose often communicates worth and value in dignity.
[time=1818] Today we want to talk primarily about the worth of a woman of God.
[time=1824] Probably the best lesson we could have men would be to go through the experience that most of us go through on occasions, and that is the day when disaster calamity of some great proportion strikes are home, and we are left at home with the kids on our own.
[time=1842] Occasionally, that strikes. Hopefully, occasionally means once every decade.
[time=1850] About two weeks ago, Kathy woke up early one morning and she was very, very ill.
[time=1855] It was so ill, there was no way that I could make my agenda for the day look so impressive that none of it could be canceled and that she would just have to survive on her own.
[time=1865] It became obvious by six o'clock in the morning that the day was mine.
[time=1870] That was an education in and of itself.
[time=1874] Most of us remember the firsts for our kids.
[time=1878] The first time they walked, the first words they said, the first time they did this and that.
[time=1883] I remember the first thing my son learned to say, it wasn't mommy, much to my disappointment, it wasn't daddy.
[time=1891] His first word was breakfast. His first complete sentence was, I want some more.
[time=1901] On that morning, the Kathy was sick at an hour too early to be described.
[time=1906] Blonde hair and blue eyes greeted me with a single word, breakfast.
[time=1914] As I endeavored to make a very elaborate breakfast, Cheerios and iced tea, there was no orange juice made.
[time=1924] My preparations for this gourmet meal were interrupted because World War III was erupting in the family room.
[time=1934] You see, a major conflict had arisen over a debate. One wanted Channel 55 for Augie's pad.
[time=1943] The other wanted Channel 39, Sesame Street, and there was no negotiations that could be handled.
[time=1951] That morning was so miserable. It was terrible.
[time=1956] To add to the story, friends we hadn't seen for eight years that we were in seminary with were coming through town
[time=1962] for lunch at the hawkses. Midway through my preparations, the garbage disposal backed up.
[time=1972] It wasn't the garbage disposal. It was the whole pipe, which I took apart and was not able to put back together.
[time=1982] I'm about as good a plumber as I am cooked.
[time=1985] Kathy came down, greeted these friends, immediately turned white and went back upstairs to retreat,
[time=1991] leaving me with three kids, two guests, and no lunch.
[time=1995] The next morning she was better, and I arose, quickly dressed, and went and took my place amongst the elders at the gate
[time=2004] and was so thankful to be there.
[time=2007] That was a lesson, and I agree with the writer Proverbs in verse 10 who said,
[time=2013] "Who can find a godly woman her price is worth more than rubies?
[time=2018] If I had rubies the day before, I would have paid them for someone to come and take over." You know, let's look at those jobs that I put in somewhat of a humorous vein, but it's real.
[time=2030] First thing we mentioned, she's a purchasing agent. Verse 13 says this.
[time=2034] She seeketh wool and flax.
[time=2038] Men take out the checkbook sometime and divide every check into two different categories.
[time=2044] The first you can call discretionary spending and non-discretionary spending.
[time=2051] When we look at our bills, they fall into those two groups.
[time=2055] The vast majority of the money that we spend, no one makes any decision on.
[time=2060] There was nothing to decide. There was no discretion involved.
[time=2064] The first of the month a house payment comes due, it's the same every time we write out the check, we pay it.
[time=2070] The utility bill comes, we open it, we pass out, we get back up and we pay it.
[time=2076] Most of the money goes in directions that there's no decision to be made.
[time=2082] Unless you happen to use the lottery method wherein you throw all the bills in the hat and you draw out the lucky winner who gets paid this month.
[time=2089] But by and large, then there are other purchases that we call discretionary.
[time=2093] Will we buy this or will we buy that?
[time=2096] Will we wait two weeks and hope that it comes on sale?
[time=2100] How much of this will we purchase?
[time=2102] That purchasing called discretionary where there is choice, coupons to be clipped, adds to be read.
[time=2110] Almost all of it falls in the hands of our wives.
[time=2114] We think when we sit down once a month if the man happens to do it and we pay the bills that we're the real financial analyst,
[time=2121] the purchasing agent for the family, when it's really our wives.
[time=2124] We're doing nothing but taking an invoice, writing a check and hoping it doesn't bounce.
[time=2130] They're the ones who when they make a purchase really make an evaluation.
[time=2135] Do I buy generic this week or not?
[time=2139] Should I go on Wednesday when they have double coupon day?
[time=2143] Or should I just pick it up quickly on the way home Tuesday?
[time=2146] They really are the purchasing agent.
[time=2149] I said they were a clothing designer for high fashion, look at verses 19 and then 21.
[time=2154] It says she lays her hands to the spindle.
[time=2157] Her hands hold the staff.
[time=2159] She's not afraid of the snow for her household.
[time=2162] For her household, her clothes with scarlet.
[time=2165] She makes herself coverings of tapestry.
[time=2167] Her clothing is silk and it's purple.
[time=2170] Here's a woman who not only takes care of the clothing needs of her family, but you'll notice she does it ahead of time in anticipation of the winter.
[time=2178] Not only that, notice that she makes it out of purple.
[time=2181] That means it was the royal, the elegant, the high fashion, the good stuff.
[time=2188] You know, so often we talk about the task of the women, but we often put them in the most reduced forms in description.
[time=2197] Instead of saying we're altering our husband's pants because he gained a few pounds,
[time=2203] why don't we say we're designing them so they're more appropriate with today's apparel?
[time=2208] You don't have to say you're letting out the waistline.
[time=2213] It's all in how we phrase it, isn't it?
[time=2216] They work as an importer of spices and exotic cuisine.
[time=2222] It says that the wife in verse 14, she is like the merchant ships that brings her food from afar.
[time=2228] I want to admit that there is a time and an appropriate time for TV dinners, frozen pizzas, and prepared foods.
[time=2236] Those are the days when my wife is not home.
[time=2241] Yesterday, Kathy was working with a mother-daughter banquet, and I had my little son, Adam, once some more hawks, and a four-year-old nephew who wasn't really excited about being with Uncle Rick when mommy just went out the door.
[time=2256] I opened up the refrigerator, and she had just a grocery shop.
[time=2259] There was all kinds of stuff there, and I decided we'd have tuna salad.
[time=2264] But then I looked at the tuna, and you had to do something to it first.
[time=2267] You got to know how much mannees to put in, and then I remember somebody else put in pickles and eggs, and I didn't, you know, boiling eggs and dice them up just to make tuna.
[time=2275] I said, "Guys, how about some peanut butter and jelly?" These four eyes looked at me like you're kidding.
[time=2283] Everything I passed by was rather simple to put together and was met with constant disapproval.
[time=2290] Fortunately, Fort Wayne is blessed with a good number of bank machines and McDonald's, and we hit them in that order.
[time=2299] You know, when you're in charge of the meal, you begin to remember that a little bit goes into that.
[time=2305] You know, men, we come home, and we just think that dinner just got together in the last 15 minutes, and yet there's all these different dishes, and they're prepared.
[time=2314] Now, oh, that's work.
[time=2316] That's really work.
[time=2319] Moving down, verse 15, it says, "She rises up also wild as yet night and give a food to her household and a portion to her maids." She's a cook.
[time=2330] Early in the morning, just as though she worked at a restaurant.
[time=2334] Only at your restaurant, everybody wants a different order.
[time=2338] Was there ever a day that all three kids voted for French toast?
[time=2342] There's always one abstention who can't be pleased and one know who wanted cereal, which was gone yesterday.
[time=2350] Cook.
[time=2352] Men, this one will get to you, a real estate agent.
[time=2355] Look at verse 16.
[time=2356] It says, "She considers a field and buys it." How many of us men could really handle if we came home?
[time=2363] We said, "Hi, honey, how was your day?" And she said, "Great.
[time=2365] I got the best price, so I went ahead and purchased this small track of 35 acres just east of town." You want what?
[time=2375] That's what this woman did.
[time=2377] She was a real estate agent.
[time=2380] She actually went out and said, "This field is going to produce and I'm going to buy it." Next verse.
[time=2388] Next part of the verse, it says, "With the fruits of her hand, she plants a vineyard." She plants a vineyard.
[time=2398] And then, she considers what that vineyard is brought forth,
[time=2406] sells it, and makes gain.
[time=2411] She takes her hands, plants a vineyard, looks it over, realizes that she's done well, and has not only enough for her household, but enough to sell and to make a profit.
[time=2425] Now, I have to admit, verse 17 reads like this.
[time=2428] She sets her work vigorously.
[time=2430] Her arms are strong for a task.
[time=2432] I think you have to read a little into the text to come out with an aerobics instructor, but you get the idea.
[time=2438] Here's a woman who is not only domestic in one sense around the house, but who has energy and physical strength and involvement and her arms and her body function, and she's fit.
[time=2452] She's capable. She's attractive.
[time=2455] She's in shape.
[time=2460] List reads on.
[time=2462] Speaks of her as she perceives her merchandise is good, and her lamp goes not out by night.
[time=2469] She's the one who's up at nighttime having worked all day who's looking over the checkbook, trying to figure out a way to save money.
[time=2476] She's the one who's got all the advertisements, the tabloids out of the Sunday paper, trying to find the place that she can get detergent on sale cheaper by buying it in the jumbo size.
[time=2487] At nighttime, she's up working for the family.
[time=2491] I said she was a guidance counselor.
[time=2493] Look with me if you want.
[time=2494] Verse 16 says she opens her mouth with wisdom, and her tongue is the law of kindness.
[time=2500] That's amazing, the type of counseling our wives are expected to do.
[time=2504] They're expected to hold an intelligent conversation simultaneously with their husbands who want to complain about the work ethic in their office and their three-year-old son who wants to talk about his boo-boo from his bike.
[time=2516] And they're just supposed to be able to go, "Oh, honey, that's a serious problem.
[time=2519] Mom, you'll kiss it later and not get the two confused." I mean, we don't mind it when she says, "We'll kiss you later." But, you know, we're really trying to talk about this problem.
[time=2529] You know, mom is that reference point in the home, and each person comes with their hurts once they're hard to be mended and sent away with an encouraged word.
[time=2538] She does it all.
[time=2540] Now, that's her work.
[time=2543] But one of the things that I found in here that I called a personnel company was my favorite one.
[time=2550] It says that her husband, in verse 23, is known in the gates where he sits amongst the elders of the land.
[time=2559] That's a Hebrew expression because the leading officials of the city sat at the gates, and when people had problems of justice, they would come and the elders would hear it out, and only the most respected men sat at the gates.
[time=2573] And here, this godly woman's husband sat at the gates, and the implication is he got there because of her.
[time=2579] I think it was Mark Twain who said, "Behind every successful man stands two women, a supportive wife, and a surprise mother-in-law." I don't know about the second, but the first is certainly true.
[time=2595] Men, if we got anywhere, we got there largely because of her.
[time=2602] That wife who encouraged us, who supplied the balance when the left side of our brain took over, and our analysis was destroying people, she reminded us that they were human.
[time=2613] She gave balance to our thinking.
[time=2615] She's the one that kept the home fires burning when our work fires were just about to go out.
[time=2621] She's the one that encouraged us when we're down and told us we could still sell one more.
[time=2626] She was the one who said, "Get up, keep going." She's the one that counseled the man who was discouraged.
[time=2634] She was the woman who said when someone was so discouraged and said through a little mouth, "I'm not going to go to school anymore." She says, "Sure you are." He said, "Why should I?" She said, "Well, you're the principal of the school.
[time=2649] They need you." If we're sitting at the gates, be they big or small gates,
[time=2659] we didn't make it there alone.
[time=2661] She was the one that matched our socks with our shoes, with our tie, with our coat, so they all fit together.
[time=2668] Don't tell me she did, and I've seen some of you dress yourselves.
[time=2672] She's the one that helped us get there.
[time=2674] She's the one that groomed us.
[time=2675] She's the one that kept all the details and made it happen.
[time=2681] A lot of colleges, particularly at the master's degree level, often award two degrees, one to the degree earner, and another one called a degree entitled P-H-T.
[time=2694] They give it to the wife.
[time=2695] It's called "Put hubby through." That's how most of us made it through life.
[time=2699] Someone was there putting us through.
[time=2703] Finally, I said she was an office manager for a diversified firm.
[time=2708] I look at my job here, and it's really a privilege, and it is so diversified, I'll be working with a banker one day and a lawyer closing the sale of Ireland Park in the hospital the next day, preparing a sermon over here, meeting and doing counseling over there, and it's so diversified.
[time=2724] But folks, it isn't anything compared to running our household.
[time=2728] That's diversified.
[time=2730] And through all of that, she has to have a good sense of humor, be able to laugh.
[time=2736] Verse 25.
[time=2739] She is clothed with strength and dignity, and can laugh in the days ahead come.
[time=2745] You know, she's the one who, when you call and say, "Oh honey, I forgot to tell you, we've got company in from out of town here at the office, and well, they'll be coming over for dinner, you know, in about an hour." She's the one who can say, "Oh, that's all right." You know, she hangs up and says something different, but she can at least laugh at those unexpected moments.
[time=2765] You know, that humor, that ability to keep life in balance when it's really out of balance.
[time=2772] You know, the Bible says she has great worth.
[time=2775] She has great worth.
[time=2777] That's what I'd like us to focus on in these ten minutes that our ours and remain, her worth.
[time=2784] Harvard begins first by saying, "Who can find such a person if you can?
[time=2788] Her price is far, far above rubies." Rubies, I don't know their relative value compared to diamonds and other gems.
[time=2797] I just know they must be extremely valuable because most of us haven't seen one for a long time.
[time=2804] And God is simply saying, a godly wife and a godly mother, they're precious, they're valuable beyond anything that this world can offer as a substitute.
[time=2817] They really are.
[time=2819] Well, we did some shopping over the last weeks and to tell you the truth, the last hours before the stores closed last night, picked out some Mother's Day gifts.
[time=2828] I bought her a hat.
[time=2830] Rachel bought her a set of pearls that Rachel's hoping to inherit soon.
[time=2835] Rebecca bought her a little beautiful cushion and unfortunately had nothing to do with Mother's Day.
[time=2841] So when she wasn't looking, I switched it and it now says children are a gift of God and Rebecca thinks she picked it out.
[time=2848] You know, we buy all these gifts.
[time=2852] We'll go out to lunch today.
[time=2855] We'll honor Mother today.
[time=2857] Those are good traditions.
[time=2859] But you know, there are five gifts that the Word of God says we can give her that are greater than a pillow from a daughter or a hat from a husband.
[time=2868] Whether they're better than lunch out today is negotiable.
[time=2870] But these gifts, God would have us to give.
[time=2874] I think the first gift that we can give our wives today, the mothers of our children and our mother's men, is a sense of worth.
[time=2882] Dr. James Dobbs wrote a book with a rather indicting title.
[time=2886] It said what wives wish their husbands knew about women.
[time=2891] And in that, there was a survey.
[time=2894] And the survey listed all eight to ten different problems that were common to women.
[time=2899] Let me just give you a sampling of the list.
[time=2902] Time pressure problems, child raising problems, financial difficulties, lack of romance in the marriage, sexual adjustment problems, self-esteem problems and in-law problems.
[time=2913] Dobbs engaged this to a large number of people and overwhelmingly every time he did that, statistically the report came back with the first thing that women said they hurt, they suffered from the most, was a lack of self-worth or low self-esteem.
[time=2930] I think it's tragic in our society that we have made two tragic decisions.
[time=2937] The first decision that we made in our culture that was devastating was the decision.
[time=2941] The child raising was primarily the work of a single parent, the mother.
[time=2946] Fathers were simply to fund the project, the mothers were to do the raising of the children.
[time=2951] And then secondly, once we removed ourself men from the role of child raising, we began to depreciate it.
[time=2957] And we communicated in our jokes, in our television sit comedies, that the role of a woman was secondary, or tertiary, are not even worth mentioning.
[time=2969] And then the feminist movement came along and fueled the fire further and reinforced in women that if you're a housewife, while you're not anything lower than what crawls under a skateboard, there couldn't be anything worse to you than being a housewife, derogatory little comments of, "Do you work or do you just stay at home?" "Oh, I just stay at home, you know, I did just anything to do around there." What we need to do, man, is we need to replace that faulty role
[time=3000] with worth and dignity.
[time=3002] Look how proverbs describe that woman.
[time=3005] More precious than rubies.
[time=3007] You know, one of the things that leads a person to self-worth is autonomy.
[time=3012] Autonomy means the ability to function independently.
[time=3016] Too many of us of men read Ephesians 5, verse 22,
[time=3022] where it says, "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands in everything."
[time=3028] I'm thinking about getting it framed.
[time=3032] We miss verse 21, which says, "To everybody, not to wives, submit yourselves one to another." You know, submission is a mutually exclusive responsibility.
[time=3043] And I think if there's anything the Word of God has been distorted to say, is that there is a role where husbands function as the sole decision-maker.
[time=3053] I like what Howard Hendricks said in his fine book, Heaven Help the Home.
[time=3057] He said, "The husband is not responsible to make every decision, but he's responsible for every decision that is made." And the wise husband will entrust his wife with a lot of decision-making and give her a lot of autonomy.
[time=3070] You know, the Word of God doesn't think that it's appropriate at all.
[time=3073] The Chica moment said, "Honey, you're not going to believe the deal I got on this 35-acre bean field just east of New Haven." I'd pick myself up off the floor.
[time=3082] I would say, "You're crazy.
[time=3084] Beans, what do you know about beans?
[time=3086] What do I know about beans?
[time=3087] We don't know beans about beans.
[time=3089] Why are you buying beans?" But you know, the real issue is, are we men willing to give that autonomy?
[time=3097] Because you see, self-worth is directly related to a person's ability to function on their own and to have worth and to have dignity.
[time=3106] Do we look at their life as simply a support role to our great things, or their life consists of great things?
[time=3113] If we want to give them worth and we've got to give them autonomy, we've got to look at our life and say, "I do not exist for my work and she exists for me to do my work, but that we exist for each other." And I need to cut back on some of my work so as to free her up for her aerobics class, her voice lesson, her night out with the girls,
[time=3135] her interest in a part-time job.
[time=3139] If you want to give a gift to your wife today, give her the gift of worth and of value.
[time=3147] Where she's hurting the most is in her self-esteem.
[time=3150] She has been told by the radio, the television set, the magazines, that her job is the lowest job a person could have.
[time=3161] God says it's the highest job a woman could ever aspire to.
[time=3165] It's more precious than rubies.
[time=3167] Anybody out there making rubies on a daily rage?
[time=3171] That's what she's worth.
[time=3174] Second gift that we could give a person is the gift of appreciation.
[time=3181] Appreciation. Look at verse 28.
[time=3185] It says, "Her children arise and call her blessed.
[time=3189] Her husband also praises her." That sounds like life, doesn't it, ladies?
[time=3194] Early in the morning, your kids' feet hit the floor.
[time=3196] They jump up, they stretch, they yawn, they walk in and say, "Good morning, mom, you're just the most wonderful mom.
[time=3203] I'm so thankful for you." First word's out of their mouth, isn't it?
[time=3208] You know, we can always do the impossible when we're encouraged
[time=3217] and we're appreciated.
[time=3220] The best plans, be it in a home or in a manufacturing plant or a sales force, the best plans without encouragement and enthusiasm are destined to failure.
[time=3232] And a mediocre plan with enthusiasm and encouragement is destined for success.
[time=3239] Men, you know how desperately you need encouragement in your job.
[time=3243] Don't ever forget your wife needs it just as much as you do.
[time=3247] Her worth is often dependent upon the encouragement that she receives from the people she labors for.
[time=3255] As you know, there aren't customers and clients coming in her door making orders.
[time=3261] No one is charting her sales quota.
[time=3264] She's often a person that gets lost in the shuffle, with no real identity.
[time=3270] You know, it seems that a woman is almost always somebody's wife.
[time=3274] She's never a person of her own.
[time=3276] And as soon as she becomes something other than so-and-so's wife, she becomes this one's mommy.
[time=3283] Kathy had a great example of that as she took over teaching the Cherub choir here, somewhat of a misnomer.
[time=3291] 44 and 5-year-olds probably really aren't Cherubs, even on their best days.
[time=3296] But on day one in Cherub choir, trying to corral all this energy, this one little girl raised her hand and she looked at Kathy and said, "I know who you are." Kathy smiled and said, "Who am I?" "Why, you're Mrs. Blackhawk."
[time=3315] The next comment I didn't appreciate.
[time=3317] She said, "And I know who your daddy is." I've got to admit, I'm five years older than my wife, but you know, that's not quite the spread.
[time=3330] You know, who are they?
[time=3334] For five years, Kathy was Rick's wife, and in one sweeping day, her identity changed.
[time=3339] She became Rachel's mommy.
[time=3343] You know, they need to have value of their own, worth of their own, and that will greatly come when they receive encouragement from us.
[time=3351] Encouragement.
[time=3355] Notice the encouragement that comes next.
[time=3358] It says this, "Her husband praises her with these words.
[time=3362] Many women do noble things.
[time=3370] But you, why, you surpass them all." He comes home and he says, "Honey, boy, you're great." You know, I know that there are a lot of women out there who are taking great care of their kids and keeping the home going and keeping everything moving, playing chauffeur, and I know some of them are working a little part-time job helping out with this and that.
[time=3391] "Honey, you're the best." I'm not sure that our wives hear that all that often.
[time=3400] Praise.
[time=3402] Encouragement.
[time=3404] And worth.
[time=3406] Those are good gifts to give.
[time=3411] Let me give you another one very quickly.
[time=3413] Verse 30.
[time=3415] "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[time=3420] Ever her reward, she has earned and let her works bring her praise at the city gate."
[time=3428] You know, not only does your wife need the gift of worth, the gift of appreciation,
[time=3434] the gift of encouragement, the gift of praise, she needs the gift of public respect.
[time=3440] Nothing will please your wife or your mother more than when you recognize her constantly in public.
[time=3447] That you include her in your victories, that she's a part of what you've done.
[time=3451] Not just a tag on, not just an edition.
[time=3453] Men, if you want to please your wife, if you really want to make her day, recognize her publicly.
[time=3460] It doesn't even have to be a large crowd.
[time=3462] Probably the greatest crowd that you can praise your wife in front of that will help her will be a crowd of one.
[time=3468] Praise her in front of your mother and it'll make her day every time.
