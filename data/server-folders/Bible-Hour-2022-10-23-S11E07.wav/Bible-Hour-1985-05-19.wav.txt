[time=65] - Good morning, and welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=69] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's The Bible Hour.
[time=77] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=86] Join us, won't you, for The Bible Hour.
[time=90] But our friends who are joining us today for The Bible Hour.
[time=93] This weekend, for the past four or five days, Pete Colby has been at a special music conference.
[time=99] He's there learning some new music, getting some new ideas to come back and to enrich the ministry here.
[time=104] And we are so appreciative of Ron Hackett stepping in as he ably does so often and assisting us in this area.
[time=111] Today, we've come to worship, to sing, to praise, to study God's word, and our choir is going to lead us as we do that this morning, as they sing, "Come, Christians, join to sing." Our sanctuary choir, as they're directed by Mr. Ron Hackett.
[time=125] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=178] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=223] (upbeat music)
[time=234] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=261] (singing in foreign language)
[time=321] (upbeat music) - Let's turn in our hymnals now to number 69.
[time=333] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=335] Shirley, I hope that that's your testimony today, that you love the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of your soul, more than anything else in your life.
[time=344] Shall we stand as we sing number 69?
[time=347] (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language)
[time=381] (singing in foreign language)
[time=411] (singing in foreign language) - On the last answer.
[time=424] (singing in foreign language)
[time=442] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=458] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=463] - This morning, we would like to take a minute in this morning worship service to say a word of appreciation and recognition to Jeff and Jennifer Vaughn.
[time=476] For approximately four years, Jeff and Jennifer served as the Sunday school superintendent of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, which is no small challenge.
[time=485] It takes over 70 Sunday school teachers just to keep toddler one, which are the cute little ones about two years old or a little less than that, through sixth grade, 70 plus teachers.
[time=497] Keeping that staff was no small challenge.
[time=500] On our last Deacon's election, Jeff was elected a Deacon of our church and he is now serving as the flock Deacon and Jennifer with him for the singles class.
[time=508] And so we wanted to take this moment to do two things, to say a word of thanks and appreciation to Jeff and Jennifer and to introduce to you a new couple, Jim and Linda Pearson, who are going to be heading up the Sunday school ministry.
[time=522] Jim and Linda have been a part of our church for a little over a year, and these are the Pearson's welcome this morning.
[time=528] We so appreciate you taking on a new challenge.
[time=531] We wanted to introduce them to you so that you would know who to contact when you want to teach elementary Sunday school.
[time=537] Jim and Linda, we appreciate your enthusiasm.
[time=539] And Jim, you've certainly tackled a new job with a lot of enthusiasm.
[time=543] - Well, Pastor Rick, it's so easy to be enthusiastic when you have so many teachers and so many people who are so dedicated and so willing to help.
[time=552] And I just want to thank all those who have helped.
[time=555] I also want to let everyone out here know that we still do have some openings for our Sunday school classrooms.
[time=562] I would like those of you who could volunteer and who would be willing to to come and we can certainly use you.
[time=568] I also want to thank Jeff and Jennifer for leaving the Sunday school program to me in such a fine organized manner.
[time=575] So it is enthusiastic because it is such a joy to serve with so many fine dedicated people.
[time=580] - Linda, you share that enthusiasm.
[time=582] I've picked that up.
[time=583] What makes you click so hard for Sunday school?
[time=586] - One of the reasons that we have a small child here and we have first-hand been able to see the benefits of having our child in a good Sunday school program.
[time=593] Jim just mentioned the fact that the Sunday school department here is very well organized and planned.
[time=598] And we're really excited about being able to come and be able to build on top of that with new programs for our teachers.
[time=604] - Jim, there's a lot of responsibility and leadership that's involved.
[time=607] What are the main challenges ahead of you?
[time=609] - The main challenge is Pastor Rick.
[time=611] Number one for me right now are to secure.
[time=614] They needed staff to staff all the positions that are open.
[time=617] And then as we look down the road a few months and even a few years down the road, we're very interested in having some in-service training for our teachers.
[time=624] We're interested in helping them as much as we can.
[time=627] One of the major challenges is to be there.
[time=629] When they need me, when they need Linda and I together, we want to help them do their job and make it as easy as possible.
[time=636] - Well, Jim and Linda, thank you so much for your leadership and your enthusiasm.
[time=640] We're certainly thankful you've taken on that big challenge.
[time=643] Thank you very much.
[time=644] Again, we do want to encourage you to support them, encourage them, pray for them.
[time=648] And if you have interest, offer to teach alongside of them.
[time=652] In the moment, we're going to hear from one of our team choirs, a group called Second Generation.
[time=657] And one of the strong areas of ministry in our church is the ministry of music and also the ministry of youth.
[time=664] Rick Halls is the director of the Second Generation and these young people are going to come and sing for us this morning.
[time=670] We're certainly proud of the work that they have done.
[time=672] A number of these young people are going to be going on student missions trips this summer.
[time=677] At least four or five of this group are in about seven or eight high school and college students from our church will be going all over the world, literally, to Europe, to South America, all around the world sharing Jesus Christ this summer.
[time=691] This is our church youth group and their name is the Second Generation.
[time=695] (gentle music)
[time=705] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=941] - Again, I want to thank you for joining us today
[time=956] for the Bible Hour.
[time=958] You've already observed that our friend and partner in the ministry, Pete Coby is not here.
[time=962] He's at a music seminar learning new music and new ideas to come back here and enrich the ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour.
[time=971] We greatly miss him, but we are so thankful for Ron Hackett's partnership in the ministry, the skill, but also the enthusiasm that he brings to filling in when Pete is not here.
[time=981] We are so thankful that you've joined us today and we want to invite you to join us at 730 Saturday evening for a radio rally that we are hosting here in partnership with WFCV.
[time=994] Dr. David Breeze of Christian Destiny Ministries will be here to preach and give a rally message on Saturday evening, this coming Saturday, May the 25th, and who also stay over to preach here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church on the Bible Hour, Sunday morning, May the 26th.
[time=1012] We do want to invite you to join us, this coming Saturday at 730.
[time=1017] This month of May, we're recognizing Mother's Day and emphasizing that theme throughout the month, and we have a pamphlet we'd like to share with you, entitled Mother, It Helps If You Smile.
[time=1029] I know from a day or two at home that motherhood raising children day in and day out as one of life's greatest challenges, it can be frustrating, it can be weary, it can tire us, but it does help if we smile.
[time=1043] This little pamphlet is coming to us from the pen of Dr. James Dobson who tells some humorous stories from his life at home and also of their relationship between, he and surely as they endeavor to raise their children.
[time=1056] We'd like to send you a copy of this pamphlet, helping you to smile on the task of parenting, particular in the task of motherhood.
[time=1064] Simply write to us today at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1072] Again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and our zip code is 46815.
[time=1083] If you'll write to us today, we would be pleased to send you a copy as a gift from us to you.
[time=1090] Today, May the 19th is a very special day in the life of our ministry here.
[time=1095] Tonight in our evening service, we'll be having the graduation commencement exercises for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1103] We have a school here that we believe a second to none.
[time=1106] It provides academic excellence on a biblical foundation, and tonight we're celebrating the graduation of over 20 of our seniors.
[time=1114] Many of them will be heading off to Christian colleges, secular colleges, private schools and public schools alike.
[time=1120] They've been equipped and trained academically, but we trust also spiritually.
[time=1125] We want to invite you to join us in that celebration tonight at six o'clock here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Christian School and Baptist Church.
[time=1135] The graduation exercise has a special plus for us who are part of the Bible Hour because Steve Sigglin, the son of Dale, our producer and director, will be graduating tonight.
[time=1145] Steve is heading to Purdue University in an engineering program, and I think Steve is the first person to ever go through Black Hawk Christian School first grade through 12th grade, and we are certainly proud of all of our graduates and Steve in particular for our 12 years of education here.
[time=1163] We do want to encourage you to come tonight, to join us for the Radio Rally, and also to write in for the pamphlet.
[time=1169] It helps if you smile.
[time=1171] If you'd like a copy of that, simply write to us today at the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1181] Now today as we go back to our morning worship service, we're going to hear from Missy Vickery, one of our graduating seniors as well.
[time=1190] This may be one of the last times we'll have a chance to hear from Missy as her family is moving to Texas, and she's heading off to school.
[time=1198] Today, we'll appreciate her ministry as she sings to us.
[time=1201] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=1333] - Thank you, Missy.
[time=1344] Missy is a senior here at Black Hawk Christian School and in about six hours, we'll have to say she was a senior here as she'll be graduating tonight along with 20 other some students from our school.
[time=1356] Missy is also one of about six, our seven high school students from our church who will be going on a student missions trip.
[time=1363] And in our Sunday evening service, we had many of them share a testimony in music as Missy's best way of communicating.
[time=1370] She's very capable at sharing a testimony as well, but we wanted you to know that she was going this summer with the Continental Ministry singers and she'll be going to Europe.
[time=1380] And specifically, she'll be going to three countries behind the Iron Curtain, including the Soviet Union.
[time=1386] And thereby way of music, she has an opportunity to be an ambassador for Christ.
[time=1390] And you and I have an opportunity to be a partner with her through the Easter offering that we gave and through praying for her and our other students this summer that they will have an opportunity to share the Lord Jesus Christ in an effective way.
[time=1404] Our God and our Father, we have listened to a song in our own hearts have agreed.
[time=1409] We will worship you.
[time=1412] We worship you as our God and our Creator.
[time=1415] We stand in awe of your power and in amazement at your grace.
[time=1421] Father, you have been merciful to us to send the Lord Jesus Christ, to die for our sins.
[time=1427] Father, we thank you and we love you and we've come today to honor you, to say that this day is the Lord's day and to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ arose again on Sunday morning.
[time=1439] Father, we worship you today.
[time=1442] We want every thought and every imagination in our heart to be brought into captivity and focus totally on you.
[time=1451] As we open your word today, Father, may we not hear a message from a man, but may you by the authority of your word and the power of your spirit apply at each of our hearts, giving to us wisdom and discretion, drawing us close to the center of your will.
[time=1467] Father, we pray that you would renew each heart here today.
[time=1471] We pray that you would renew the heart of a family, that you would cause forgiveness to flow from member to member that lives might be rebuilt.
[time=1480] We pray today for those who are physically suffering.
[time=1483] We pray that you would restore to them health.
[time=1486] We pray that you would give to their families grace.
[time=1489] Father, today, we pray that you would give us strength lest we grow weary and well-doing.
[time=1494] Help us to focus our vision on you and not serve people, but serve the Lord Jesus Christ and through him the ministry go to people.
[time=1503] Father, today, we pray for those whose burdens are enormous, whose pain is great, that you would strengthen them.
[time=1511] We pray for the dables and the lampmen's.
[time=1515] We pray for Ray Stettler and Ralph Kramer.
[time=1518] We pray for Joyce Free and Catherine Northrop and Harry Bennett and the list goes on and on.
[time=1526] Yet God, there are needs within this own body that have never been spoken.
[time=1531] Discretion causes a heart to keep quiet and they can mourn and lament only to you.
[time=1537] God, we pray that you'd bring comfort.
[time=1539] Through your word today, we pray that you would restore us and refresh us.
[time=1544] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1547] Invite you to open your Bibles with us to study again this Sunday morning from Proverb 31.
[time=1554] And while you're turning to the 31st Proverb, I would share with you that life has a sense of justice.
[time=1562] Last week by way of illustration I shared with you that in Cherub Choir, a little girl looked at Kathy and said, "I know who you are, you're Mrs. Blackhawk." Kathy's been given a variety of names.
[time=1574] I mentioned that she's often known as Rick's wife or Rachel's mommy.
[time=1578] Well, justice has a way of returning to the sender.
[time=1581] This past week I was informed by parents and children alike of who I am.
[time=1587] Occasionally I may be recognized for a number of things, but this week it was pointed out to me by a two-year-old that I am Adam's daddy.
[time=1596] Kristen Mansfield reminded me that I am Becca's father.
[time=1603] It seems that all of us lose our identity and our work and in our relationships, and that isn't all bad.
[time=1609] But let us never forget the worth of the individual.
[time=1613] Proverbs 31 speaks of the worth of the godly woman, that she has value in and of herself, not simply because of the task that she performs around the house or her relationship to someone else in her family.
[time=1626] She has worth.
[time=1627] How much is she worth?
[time=1629] Proverbs 31, 10.
[time=1631] Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies.
[time=1639] The heart of her husband death safely trusts in her so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[time=1646] She will do him good and not evil, all the days of her life.
[time=1652] She seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.
[time=1657] She is like the merchants' ships.
[time=1659] She brings her food from afar.
[time=1662] She rises also wild as yet night and give a food to her household and a portion to her maidens.
[time=1669] She considereth a field and buyeth it.
[time=1672] With the fruit of her hands, she planeth a vineyard.
[time=1675] She girdeth her loins with strength and strengthened with her arms.
[time=1680] She perceiveeth that her merchandise is good and her lamp goes not out by night.
[time=1687] She layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaffed.
[time=1692] She stretches out her hands to the pore.
[time=1695] Yay, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.
[time=1698] She is not afraid of the snow for her household.
[time=1703] For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
[time=1708] She makeeth herself coverings of trapez tree.
[time=1713] Her clothing is silk and purple.
[time=1716] Her husband is known in the gates when he siteth amongst the elders of the land.
[time=1724] She make a fine linen and sells it and deliverth girdles under the merchant.
[time=1729] Strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in the time to come.
[time=1735] She openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the knowledge of the law of kindness.
[time=1743] She knoweth well.
[time=1745] She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness.
[time=1751] Her children rise up and call her blessed.
[time=1754] Her husband also and praises her.
[time=1756] Many daughters have done virtuously but thou excelest them all.
[time=1763] Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
[time=1773] Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her in the gates.
[time=1780] Proverbs 31, a proverb in salute and in quest of the godly woman.
[time=1789] Before we look at this proverb, let's take a moment and establish a few points of background.
[time=1796] In chapter 31, verse one, it tells us that the author of this Psalm is a, our proverb rather is a rather unknown personality.
[time=1805] It says the words of King Lemuel.
[time=1809] To be quite honest, there are not volumes written on the life of King Lemuel.
[time=1814] There aren't even pages written on the life of King Lemuel, there aren't even paragraphs.
[time=1819] He's one of the most obscure figures of history.
[time=1822] Who he is were not certain, there are two possibilities.
[time=1826] Possibility number one is that King Lemuel was a king of a very minor province, somewhere near Israel was a God-fearing man who knew the Lord God Jehovah and worshiped him and the Spirit of God inspired him to write this, but his rule as a king was rather small, his territory incidental and history has failed to record a word about him other than this one proverb.
[time=1852] There's a second possibility, however, and that is the possibility that there was no one really named King Lemuel, but this was the pen name of a different writer and perhaps the different writer with Solomon.
[time=1866] Throughout history, many men have used pen names.
[time=1869] Samuel Clemens wrote under the name of Mark Twain.
[time=1873] Eric Blair wrote under the name of George Orwell, perhaps Solomon, knowing that he was going to write some graphic words about womanhood, used a different name for fear of reprisal from some ancient feminist movement in Hebrew history.
[time=1890] Whether that was the cause we're not completely certain, it is probably a matter of speculation either way, but my speculation would be this indeed comes from the pen of Solomon who chose a different name that we don't know the meaning of, but was meaningful to the nation of Israel at that time.
[time=1907] But there's a second point of background.
[time=1910] This particular proverb is 22 verses long.
[time=1915] And in the Hebrew Bible, these 22 verses each begin with a word, and the first word of each of these verses begins with a letter, and the letter of the first word of each verse is the alphabet of the Hebrew vocabulary.
[time=1931] So that verse 10 begins with a word, the first letter of which is olive.
[time=1941] The third verse, or verse 12, begins with the Hebrew word that has its first letter, gimel.
[time=1947] And hence, the alphabet was portrayed through these 22 verses.
[time=1952] The 22 characters of the Hebrew alphabet were put in alphabetical order.
[time=1956] Why did they do that?
[time=1958] Well, we call that an alphabetical acrostic.
[time=1962] It is indeed a form of poetry, but it's not primarily written for the purpose of poetry.
[time=1968] The reason why there are 22 verses that each begin in alphabetical order with the Hebrew alphabet is that was a literary device employed by the writer to help his readers remember and memorize this passage.
[time=1984] Now, I am going to be honest with you and say my memorization isn't what it should be.
[time=1990] We all need to work on that.
[time=1992] When I was a Hebrew student in Talbot Theological Seminary,
[time=1998] our Hebrew professor, Dr. Charles Feinberg, had committed the majority of the Old Testament to memory, and he was embarrassed because his friend, not even a believer in the Lord Jesus in seminary, about 60 years ago, memorized two important documents.
[time=2017] The first document this person memorized was the entire Hebrew Old Testament.
[time=2025] More impressively, this individual also memorized the Hebrew concordance.
[time=2032] For those of you who may not be familiar, a concordance is a listing of every word in the Bible
[time=2040] according to its occurrence.
[time=2042] You could look up the word for son, Ben.
[time=2046] And you'd find the Hebrew word Ben.
[time=2049] And you would find in a concordance from Genesis through Malachi every time it occurs.
[time=2055] This gentleman had committed all of it to memory.
[time=2057] I'm a little bit behind him.
[time=2059] I've not quite caught up to that standard yet.
[time=2061] I've got John 3.16 nailed down and solid.
[time=2066] But why then would they put this alphabet to help us to memorize it?
[time=2070] God wrote this not only for our casual reading, but for our thorough study and with the anticipation that we would follow the example of David and memorize his word.
[time=2081] David said, "God, thy word have I hid in my heart." Why?
[time=2087] So that I might not sin against the-- the greatest remedy you and I have available to us for defeating sin in our life, the greatest source of victory we have for becoming overcomers in life is to memorize the scriptures.
[time=2105] If you'll recall in Matthew chapter 4, Jesus was tempted, a front-on verbal physical assault by Satan.
[time=2114] Three times Satan tried to simply sidetrack Jesus, not into something that was bad, simply detract him into something that was good so that he wouldn't do the something that God had for him that was best.
[time=2128] And as each of those three temptations occurred, Jesus met each of those temptations with the exact same three words.
[time=2136] It is written.
[time=2141] Three temptations, three times Jesus said it is written, and he proceeded to quote the book of Deuteronomy.
[time=2148] How did Jesus overcome temptation in his life?
[time=2151] It was that he filled his mind and his heart with the Word of God so that when temptation faced him, he didn't look at it through human eyes.
[time=2160] He didn't use human logic.
[time=2162] He didn't have human appetites in control.
[time=2164] He had the Word of God first and foremost, and his response was that of the Word of God.
[time=2170] God's Word was given not only for our casual reading,
[time=2176] but for our study and for our memory.
[time=2179] In this passage, it was one of primary importance in antiquity.
[time=2183] For the Hebrews knew the value of the home and the worth of a godly wife that she was more precious than rubies.
[time=2190] And so sons would be instructed by both their mother and father alike to seek such a wife.
[time=2196] Proverbs has in it many, many warnings against negative wife selection.
[time=2203] In chapters two, five, six, seven, and nine, all of those chapters, there are strict warnings against the unfaithful wife.
[time=2212] The Bible also has words about a wife who would not be an encourager.
[time=2218] But this chapter comes as the support for the godly woman for encouragement, for admonition.
[time=2227] Last week, we gave a general outline of two concepts, two points, that this proverb addresses first, the worth and secondly, the work of the godly woman.
[time=2237] Could I review for you just a moment this morning?
[time=2240] As we talked about the worth of the godly woman, I believe there are five things that this particular proverb says that we ought to supply to the godly woman as her reward.
[time=2251] Her worth is more than rubies.
[time=2255] What is her reward?
[time=2257] Her reward.
[time=2259] First and foremost, I would say that this passage speaks of the self-worth of a mother, of a wife, of a woman.
[time=2267] It speaks of her intense value, being more precious than rubies.
[time=2273] Jim Dobson tells us that the greatest fear are the greatest point of hurt in the life of many women as their sense of self-worth, that our society and our husbands have failed to reinforce their worth and hear God says they have great value.
[time=2289] A second thing, the Bible and this particular passage would say is the reward, not only of declaring her worthiness, but also the reward of appreciation.
[time=2298] Verse 28, her children rise up and call her blessed and so does her husband, that she is a woman who is worthy of every appreciation that we can give her.
[time=2312] A third thing, by way of reward.
[time=2315] It says not only appreciation, but encouragement.
[time=2319] Verse 29, Hox's paraphrase, wow.
[time=2323] There's a lot of sharp women out there, honey, but none of them can hold a candle to you.
[time=2328] You're the best.
[time=2329] Some sincere, and underline the word sincere flattery, forms encouragement and becomes the basis of continued labor and love, encouragement.
[time=2339] A fourth gift to be given by way of reward for her character is the gift of praise.
[time=2346] To be honored, to be spoken of highly, to have the words come back, well done.
[time=2352] I appreciate you, I love you, you have worth to receive praise.
[time=2356] Finally, verse 31, public respect.
[time=2361] To be held up and honored, to be held up in dignity.
[time=2363] Those are the gifts that are worth are worthy of that reward.
[time=2369] Now we speak primarily of the work of the woman of God this morning.
[time=2373] When we do that, this morning, rather than focusing on job descriptions, I'd like to focus in on the work that is the hardest, and that is the work of values.
[time=2385] Last week, I trust by way of appropriateness, we put together a list, a job description that women fill.
[time=2393] We talked about the fact that there are real estate agents and commodities brokers, that there are seamstress and designers for fashion apparel, that there are short-order cooks and the preparers of fine exotic cuisine.
[time=2407] They also serve as purchasing agents and guidance counselor.
[time=2411] Those are the job descriptions.
[time=2414] But in this, there are some values.
[time=2417] And let us look this morning at the biblical values that the scripture speaks of, of the woman of God.
[time=2425] But notice that we use the word biblical values.
[time=2428] One of the common phrases that we hear of today in evangelical circles is the phrase traditional values.
[time=2435] May I share with you that we are not fondly attached to traditional values.
[time=2441] Many of our traditional values are good.
[time=2444] Many of them are not good.
[time=2446] And to simply think that if we could just go back to the good old days, everything would be fine.
[time=2452] Well, there were never any good old days, a generation to go.
[time=2455] You know what parents talked about?
[time=2457] Getting back to the good old days.
[time=2459] You know what the generation before them talked about?
[time=2462] The good old days, the good old days were never good.
[time=2464] They were just the old days.
[time=2466] And a lot of our values, I hope we never reproduce in this country again.
[time=2472] No, the our traditional value say if a colony isn't being populated fast enough, just open up the prisons of England and send them to Georgia.
[time=2481] That's our traditional values.
[time=2483] Our traditional value says you have a different race than I am, therefore you can be my slave.
[time=2489] That's our values.
[time=2490] That's our tradition.
[time=2492] Our values say because we've got guns and you've only got bows and arrows, we're gonna take Manhattan and give you Oklahoma.
[time=2498] Our values say you do this job and you do the exact same identical job and we're gonna pay you more and pay you less because you're a man and you're a woman.
[time=2509] That's our traditional values.
[time=2512] Let's be careful not to just talk about traditions and doing it the way we used to because not all of our traditions are God-honoring.
[time=2519] Not all of our traditions are honoring of mankind.
[time=2523] We're looking for biblical values, not traditional values.
[time=2527] As we come to this many times in poetry, as this is the case in a proverb, there is a building factor.
[time=2534] And I think the chief biblical value that is given here is the value that is given last.
[time=2541] It's as though he is built to this point, verse 30.
[time=2546] Favor is deceitful, beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.
[time=2558] The number one job description, the number one value, the number one goal, the number one priority of the woman of God is to fear him.
[time=2570] Before we go a step further, may I just say a word to the men.
[time=2574] This isn't a day off.
[time=2576] Everything that God's word says by way of priorities and values for women is equally a value to us as men.
[time=2584] Don't pass the buck.
[time=2586] It stops with us as much as with them.
[time=2589] The greatest attribute, the greatest value, the chief work that we have is to honor, to fear and to respect the Lord.
[time=2597] This word fear is often and appropriately translated to honor or to respect.
[time=2603] And we often use it in the sense of honoring and respecting a king so also we honor and respect God.
[time=2609] Yet I believe there is more to it than that.
[time=2612] It is more than just simply standing in awe.
[time=2614] It is the fact that we daily live under his authority.
[time=2618] That we recognize his sovereignty in every area of our life and we live our life with the reference point that my number one concern in life is to please God.
[time=2629] That's a very different value than we receive today.
[time=2636] And it is so important in our lives, men and women, that as parents, not only for our own sake, but for the sake of our children, that we model and live godly lives before them because they will become what we are.
[time=2653] My father is so much like my grandfather, you can hardly tell the two of them apart other than looks.
[time=2660] And I am becoming daily in my thought processes, so much like my dad, I could probably call him up and ask what he did at 32 and know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
[time=2670] And my little boy, he's two years old, and every time he puts on a tie, he looks at it and he says, just like dad, our kids wanna be like us.
[time=2682] Our little boy's got a lawnmower and I can no longer cut the grass without him coming out with his lawnmower.
[time=2687] It makes all the appropriate sounds and you put the little bubble stuff that you normally bow bubbles with in this part and it bows out bubbles for exhaust and he is sure that he's cutting the grass.
[time=2697] And he's falling right along behind me, disgusted that I'm cutting his spot and he's doing it to be just like dad, just like dad.
[time=2706] This morning, Rachel got up and said, "See my white lace?
[time=2709] "I'm wearing this because mom's dress "has got white lace on it today." Oh, they desperately, desperately want to be like us.
[time=2719] Let us desperately, desperately want to be like our Heavenly Father.
[time=2725] So when they're like us, they're like him.
[time=2729] The greatest value, the greatest work of the man of God or the woman of God is to fear and honor the Lord.
[time=2739] And if it's not in your life, the statistical odds are that it won't be in their lives either.
[time=2746] You know, we have an excellent Sunday school program here and an excellent Christian school.
[time=2750] And if you send this ministry, your children, six days a week, it is very likely that we will not be able to produce values in them that aren't in you.
[time=2759] A Christian Sunday school and a Christian school are never a substitute for Christian parents.
[time=2768] They will be more like you, the odds are in that favor.
[time=2773] Oh, there'll be a few rare exceptions by the grace of God, but just like a two-year-old boy who says, "Just like Dad." So the 22-year-old boy doesn't say it, he just does it, just like Dad.
[time=2787] Would you be a godly woman today?
[time=2791] Would you be the godly man?
[time=2794] Then the chief priority of your life has got to be to fear and honor him.
[time=2801] And that runs contrary to our society.
[time=2804] There was never a generation more materialistic than mine.
[time=2808] I'm part of the idealistic generation.
[time=2811] When we were students, we protested injustice around the world.
[time=2815] We all wanted to be social workers.
[time=2817] We're gonna help humanity.
[time=2818] We were called hippies and yippies.
[time=2822] You know what the hippies and yippies are called today?
[time=2824] They're called yuppies.
[time=2826] You know what a yuppie is?
[time=2828] It's an acrostic for a young, urban, professional.
[time=2833] All of those ideals are gone.
[time=2835] One individual said, "We've now become the children "our parents always wanted us to, "and we're beating them at their game." A yuppie is a materialist.
[time=2845] Charles Colson in an article of it captured the spirit of a yuppie when he saw a young man trying to render limousine and on his t-shirt was the philosophy of the yuppie, our generation.
[time=2857] His t-shirt read, "The one who dies with the most toys wins."
[time=2863] And that's what life has said.
[time=2866] Abandoned values, abandoned principles, live for gain.
[time=2870] And we're saying live for God.
[time=2874] He may choose to bless you with great gain along the way.
[time=2878] He may not, but if you'll live for him, he'll honor you.
[time=2880] It's the greatest value you can incorporate into your life.
[time=2885] It's strategic.
[time=2886] We're one generation away from extinction as Christians.
[time=2891] The only hope we have is to reproduce Christ in the lives of the next generation and hope that they will do that in the next and in seceding generations.
[time=2902] And the greatest avenue we have to do that isn't the church and it isn't the Christian school and it certainly isn't by hiring more pastors.
[time=2911] It is by being parents and people who have as their chief priority, fearing and honoring the Lord.
[time=2916] A second quality that emerges.
[time=2922] Right at the beginning of this, it speaks about her value being far more than rubies and it gives this capstone at the very beginning.
[time=2932] Verse 13, "The heart of her husband, doth safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil.
[time=2939] "She will do him good and not evil "all the days of our life." First, a commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2951] Secondly, the Godly woman has a commitment to her husband and conversely, the Godly man will have a commitment to his wife.
[time=2960] That commitment is to say that all of my days I will do my spouse good.
[time=2966] There is an old adage that says
[time=2972] that a man's home is this castle.
[time=2977] It's equally true that a woman's home should be her castle.
[time=2980] You know, the world can beat us up, it can mistreat us, it can abuse us, it can short changes, it can falsely accuse us, it can battle us, but if we come home, if our home is full of love and peace, we'll do just fine, we'll really make it.
[time=2997] If a man comes home to a woman who loves him and who doesn't good and who endeavors intensely to make their home a palace of peace, where tranquility resides, then regardless of the successes or failures, the insults and the injuries of the day, life will have value and will have worth and fulfillment, because home is truly a home.
[time=3024] Likewise, when a woman senses that her husband is more committed to the integrity and the tranquility and their piece of their home more than he is, the prosperity of his job and he pours his life into that and there's peace in their home, there's fulfillment in that life.
[time=3042] Desperately, many, many of us today, desperately try to fill our schedule and fill our calendar so we have to spend so little time at home because there is no peace there.
[time=3053] It's all been warned of the peace several times in these proverbs.
[time=3059] Let me just share a few of them with you.
[time=3060] Proverbs 12 verse four.
[time=3065] A disgraceful wife is like decay.
[time=3072] In his bones.
[time=3074] Proverbs 19 verse 13.
[time=3078] A foolish son is his father's ruin and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.
[time=3085] I had a grim reminder of that this morning.
[time=3090] I made a phone call as I was here reading my notes and preparing my mind for the message and as I made a phone call, I didn't realize I didn't get the phone right exactly square on the cradle and it was going beep beep beep and it was just this low dull sound.
[time=3105] I thought who was outside pounding on the wall and with a very disgusted manner, I opened the door and I looked out there trying to look very scornful as whoever it was would quit.
[time=3115] There was nobody there.
[time=3117] Well, right behind my desk are these windows and there's a little playground set and I was sure that there were either some curtain climbers or yard apes that had climbed up there and they're just pounding away.
[time=3126] So I slid open my window and I was going, there's nobody there and I screed and I can't even read because that beep is in the background and it's going on and it's going on.
[time=3136] Finally, this very intelligent, sophisticated person said, ah, the phone and I hung it up and peace returned to my life.
[time=3143] No many of us have wives who are constant dripping,
[time=3150] a constant dripping.
[time=3154] There is nothing more disheartening than a voice that can never be satisfied.
[time=3160] Some of us as men have mastered the same art.
[time=3166] That our words, our barbs, our looks, our darts,
[time=3172] and our emotings, our negative emotions, the next proverb,
[time=3183] better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome spouse.
[time=3191] Isn't that the truth?
[time=3194] I don't care how much money you make.
[time=3195] You can't buy enough square feet to live in if you've got a quarrelsome spouse.
[time=3199] You'd be far better to go up in the corner attic, lay down under the roof and lament it alone than to go down in the living room and to live with the constant dripping.
[time=3212] Proverb 27, 15 and 16.
[time=3216] A quarrelsome wife, let's plug in a spouse, is like a constant dripping on a rainy day.
[time=3223] Restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with a hand.
[time=3228] Now if you think these are just trite little sayings and the author had no knowledge where any spoke, remember this man had over 1,000 wives and concubine.
[time=3240] He was an expert on the subject.
[time=3242] The greatest gift that we can give each other
[time=3249] is a commitment to the Lord.
[time=3251] And then a commitment to that our home is gonna be a palace of peace.
[time=3255] That whatever it takes for me to do it, I'm going to make home a place that Kathy looks forward to me coming to.
[time=3262] I can remember being a little guy.
[time=3267] And when the babysitter was there causing the babysitter no small amount of grief.
[time=3273] And when I would see in the nighttime lights flash across the living room as the car turned in the driveway, we were yelling to my sister, "Head for the covers, they're home." And we would dive into bed, lay under the sheets, regardless of whether we were in pajamas or not and play possum, for fear that the babysitter would tell all and my dad would deal with it then.
[time=3297] Head for the covers, they're home.
[time=3299] You know what I fear?
[time=3303] Too many days when we pull in the driveway at five o'clock.
[time=3307] Not because of what they've done, but because of who we are, our kids yell.
[time=3311] Head for the cover.
[time=3313] He's home.
[time=3313] Wives can I make a subtle suggestion that I don't even think's in the text.
[time=3319] I'm gonna be honest.
[time=3320] If you need to discipline your children, discipline them, but whatever you do, don't say you just wait 'til your father gets home.
[time=3327] Can I tell you that makes more than a few problems in the parent-child relationship?
[time=3333] Makes dad's arrival something like the news of Pearl Harbor.
[time=3337] Men, let's be committed that when we pull into that driveway,
[time=3344] we don't come home on empty tanks.
[time=3346] And I'm not talking about the one in the automobile, talking about my heart.
[time=3350] They don't come home saying I've had it today.
[time=3353] Everybody back off 10 feet.
[time=3355] Space, it's my only request.
[time=3359] Don't come home on empty.
[time=3362] Wives don't spend it all during the day.
[time=3364] So that when he hits the door, you say, here they are.
[time=3369] Your children low and inheritance of the Lord.
[time=3372] (audience laughing) Home is where life makes up its mind.
[time=3382] Let's make up our mind.
[time=3384] That's gonna be one of commitment to our spouses.
[time=3386] So it's a palace of peace.
[time=3388] A third priority that comes up in this song very quickly is the priority of children.
[time=3392] These children rise up and call her blessed.
[time=3395] Why? Because she's provided and prepared for them, everything that they need.
[time=3399] Priorities, commitment to the Lord, commitment to your spouse, commitment to your children.
[time=3405] A fourth one.
[time=3406] This woman also had a commitment to interest outside the home.
[time=3410] She really did.
[time=3411] She bought and sold land.
[time=3412] She ran a private business on the side.
[time=3414] Little seamstress shops, she had a vineyard of her own.
[time=3416] She counted the profit.
[time=3417] Men, whatever you do, don't make your demands of the home so high that you turn your palace into a prison.
[time=3425] You know, both palaces and prisons have locked doors on them, don't they?
[time=3429] But there's a big difference.
[time=3431] A prison locks the door to keep somebody in.
[time=3435] A palace locks the door to keep people out.
[time=3438] Don't try to keep your wife in.
[time=3439] Don't try to lock her in and box her in.
[time=3442] Give her space.
[time=3443] Those priorities are still valid today.
[time=3446] Commitment to the Lord.
[time=3448] Commitment to spouse.
[time=3449] Commitment to children.
[time=3451] Then finally, commitment to the outside interest.
[time=3453] Some of you are dying for me to say.
