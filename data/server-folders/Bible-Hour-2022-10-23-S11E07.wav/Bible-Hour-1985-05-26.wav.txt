[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=61] - We welcome you to our morning worship service.
[time=63] Trust that you will join with us as we sing together, as we pray, and as we worship the Lord.
[time=68] Let's continue sing together, him and my brother.
[time=71] Now, live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=79] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rickoff.
[time=89] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=93] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=118] - Did you turn please to him number eight hundred one, and we'll continue our singing, singing How Great Thou Art, him number eight hundred one.
[time=125] [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=182] - Let's just close our books and sing that chorus
[time=188] one more time, lifting it unto the Lord, sing it.
[time=191] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=219] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=228] We're especially glad that you've come to worship the Lord together at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=236] We're glad that you're here.
[time=238] Our pastor Rick Hawks is on vacation for the next two weeks.
[time=241] We are especially delighted to introduce to you a little later in the program Dr. Dave Breeze will be speaking to us.
[time=248] And then we'll have Dr. Sproul next week.
[time=251] We also welcome right now the Bible hour viewers and we're glad that you've joined with us and I trust that you'll receive a blessing from the service today.
[time=260] Let's listen, how is the choir sings a song?
[time=262] And bless it is the nation whose God is the Lord.
[time=266] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=293] [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=501] - Amen.
[time=508] Thank you, choir, for that good ministry and song.
[time=511] Let's continue now with him number 140.
[time=514] Beneath the cross of Jesus, I fame would take my stand, him number 140.
[time=519] (gentle music)
[time=526] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=650] - Thank you very much for paying attention
[time=660] to the music and especially the text.
[time=662] The last verse says, "The wonders of redeeming love and my unworthiness." It's amazing, isn't it, how God saw fit to save us?
[time=671] Yet we were unworthy of the death that He paid that glorious resurrection that gives us eternal life.
[time=677] Let's continue with music now as we listen to the ministry through Denise Mitchell.
[time=682] (upbeat music)
[time=701] [MUSIC - 159 seconds]
[time=875] (audience chattering) - Good morning.
[time=880] This is a point in time when we break away from our regular service and tell you about special events happening in the life of our church.
[time=887] Our pastor Rick Hawks is on vacation today, so I have with me our associate pastor, George Lantman.
[time=893] Good morning, George. - Good morning, Peter.
[time=895] - Among the many responsibilities that George has around the church, George is in charge of super 60s.
[time=901] That's a very exciting ministry that takes place once a week here at the church.
[time=905] I always look forward to seeing the supers as they come in the door.
[time=908] George, tell us a little bit about that ministry.
[time=910] - Certainly, I will, yes.
[time=912] Well, as you said, we meet every Friday at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[time=917] And there's a great group that comes in.
[time=918] It's open to all people.
[time=920] Of course, we do have an age limit, 55 to 105.
[time=923] - You're getting one person that's kind of close to 105, right? - Yes, well, we've given him a special dispensation.
[time=928] Aljo Watson's 100, and we've removed that requirement for him.
[time=933] We had a great celebration just a few weeks ago as the mayor was here.
[time=936] And we had special calls from the White House and other places celebrating Aljo Watson's birthday.
[time=942] So those are some of the events that take place in super 60s.
[time=946] George also has a special event coming up that he'd like to tell all of our listeners about.
[time=951] George, the Holy Land Trip is fast approaching.
[time=953] Would you tell us about that?
[time=954] - Yes, I will, Peter.
[time=955] I don't know whether you have been to the Holy Land or not, but if you haven't, you should go because this trip is an exciting trip.
[time=962] It's a little different than most of them.
[time=964] We're gonna be visiting Greece, Egypt, in Israel, and also a Mediterranean cruise.
[time=969] And that's gonna be exciting because we're gonna follow some of Paul's missionary trip.
[time=974] And we'll be going to Corinth, Rhodes, Athens, Ephesus, and then right to the island of Patmos where John wrote Revelation.
[time=982] - Every time I talk to you about it, and we're just a few doors apart in our offices, I get more excited about the opportunities that people have to go.
[time=990] Now this trip takes place when?
[time=992] - Well, August the 9th to 23rd.
[time=994] - And obviously, probably another question would be, there must be some cost to it.
[time=999] - Yes, that would be an obvious question, wouldn't it?
[time=1001] And the cost is $2095 from New York.
[time=1005] - All right, they're leaving August 9th and coming back to 23rd, and you've heard the cost of the trip.
[time=1011] George, how can they find out more information?
[time=1013] Do you have a pamphlet or anything?
[time=1014] - Yes, we do.
[time=1015] We have a brochure, a color brochure, which tells all about the trip each day of the trip, and if they would call the church here or write in to the church, why they would be able to get all the information's needed.
[time=1027] I would say this, Peter, though, it's rapidly filling up, and once we meet our meet our quota, there'll be no more accepted.
[time=1034] - Well, let me encourage all of our listeners then to write in for the pamphlet for the Holy Land Trip on August 9th.
[time=1041] You can receive the pamphlet by calling the church at 749-8524 or writing to the Blackhawk Baptist Church, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1055] I hope that you will write for the pamphlet and have the opportunity to at least see the opportunity that's there for you and come along and join George.
[time=1063] Are there other people going, George, that help out with the trip?
[time=1067] - There'll be people from all over the country, but the one main host is Dr. James T. Jeremiah, Peter, and he's been there 13 times.
[time=1074] I went last year with him.
[time=1075] - I'm sure he's well-versed in the activities in the various areas, and that will be a great help to you as well as the people on the trip.
[time=1082] - It certainly will.
[time=1083] It actually unfolds the Bible right before your eyes.
[time=1086] - I'd like to speak about a little pamphlet that we've been advertising for the last month or so.
[time=1092] This pamphlet is entitled "Motherhood." It helps you to smile, and when I first looked at it, I thought, well, that's just strictly for mothers, but it's for mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers, if you have any children around, here's a little pamphlet that'll help out that very dreary day when you think everything is going wrong when it as it relates to your children.
[time=1112] It is a compilation of short stories that are taken from the books by James Dobson, and you can receive this pamphlet.
[time=1119] It'll be hilarious to you and will encourage you on those blue Mondays or blue days that you have.
[time=1125] Let me encourage you to write for the pamphlet to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1135] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1142] In the absence of our pastor, our special speaker is Dr. David Breeze from Christian Destiny.
[time=1148] In just a few moments, we'll be hearing his message.
[time=1150] I'm glad that you've tuned in with us, and I hope that you'll stay tuned for this timely message.
[time=1155] (gentle music)
[time=1167] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=1252] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=1455] - I visited at the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida last Sunday, and after the choir and the special music had finished, the pastor got up and said, "The music was good." (audience laughs) And I wanna say today that I'm glad to be back at Black Hawk and appreciate the music of our volunteers that Sunday after Sunday give of their talents to the Lord to sing a song such as Susan Just saying, "Lamb of Glory." Praise the Lord for people that have instruments like that that can give honor and praise to the Lord through music.
[time=1494] We mentioned that Rick is on vacation last evening.
[time=1498] We had a radio rally for WFCV in our Convocation Center.
[time=1503] It was a great time of fellowship with the people that listened to that radio station and with the station manager, Neil Carr.
[time=1511] Their special guest was Dr. David Breeze.
[time=1514] And Dave Breeze is with us this morning to speak to us.
[time=1517] Dave is the president of Christian Destinies Incorporated from Hillsborough, Kansas.
[time=1523] Dave is a lecturer and author and has heard many times throughout the nation on radio and television.
[time=1528] His message is very relevant for today.
[time=1531] Certainly he gave us a lot to think about last night and again this morning.
[time=1535] We're delighted that we have such men of God that can come and speak to us while our pastor is gone and Dave we welcome you to Black Hawk and encourage you now and pray for you as you minister the word of God to our people.
[time=1547] The Lord bless you as you preach.
[time=1549] - Thank you Pete Coby.
[time=1555] And I concur that this morning's service as I'm sure you do as well has been a time already of great blessing and wonderful inspiration.
[time=1563] Longfellow said the night shall be filled with music and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the Arabs and as silently steal away.
[time=1573] And he must have said that after a visit to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1578] Because you have the kind of music that many churches don't get in a month.
[time=1583] Perhaps in a year, some never.
[time=1586] And so I know that you appreciate what God has already said to our hearts this morning.
[time=1590] It's marvelous to be with Pete Coby once again.
[time=1593] I knew him when he was a very small child back in Gary, Indiana.
[time=1597] And I was a very young man as well.
[time=1600] And what a blessing it's been to see what God has done through your ministry here and to see him as a part of the music program and in this position of strategic leadership.
[time=1611] Since those days he has grown in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.
[time=1616] Of course he's still working on the stature.
[time=1619] But it's great to see what the Lord has done.
[time=1624] We're delighted that you are here this morning.
[time=1627] And I trust that you have come to this morning's service allowing for the possibility that this will be a time of very special blessing for each of us.
[time=1636] When I came in I passed a book table that is in the lobby.
[time=1639] And I noticed a number of folks examining the high grade material which was there.
[time=1643] And so I've been asked by the management to tell you what is available at that book table.
[time=1648] Let me give you just a word about it.
[time=1651] There are three full-length books.
[time=1653] This one is called Discover Your Destiny.
[time=1656] An overview of the Christian life.
[time=1658] Many people think by the way that a Christian is a blessed clod waiting for the benediction.
[time=1664] That's not quite true.
[time=1665] He's a person of destiny.
[time=1667] A special individual.
[time=1668] His infernal majesty.
[time=1670] Subtitled Satan's 10 Most Believable Lies.
[time=1674] And then know the marks of cults.
[time=1677] Cults are growing in America.
[time=1679] There are now 4,000 with at least 5 million members.
[time=1683] And therefore, we must know aberrant religion developing in our world today.
[time=1688] In the ministry of Christian destiny, besides reaching out in radio and television in many other ways, we have a program called Publishers Together, our literature ministry.
[time=1697] And therefore, a number of these booklets has developed.
[time=1700] Why is Christianity true?
[time=1702] The wealth by which we live.
[time=1704] You may be richer than you think.
[time=1706] The dawn of a new age.
[time=1709] There are some very big guiling utopian movements going in the world today.
[time=1713] Shall we believe we can restart history?
[time=1716] Think about it.
[time=1717] The horsemen of the apocalypse.
[time=1719] And then we have the exciting plan of God for your life.
[time=1724] Many people think, by the way, that the Christian life is a sort of a serendipity proposition.
[time=1729] Actually, it can be diagrammed.
[time=1730] And here it is.
[time=1731] You can check right where you are by way of spiritual progress.
[time=1735] And then let me especially mention the fate of a nation, particularly on this Memorial Day weekend.
[time=1742] This has just been produced.
[time=1743] This is the first weekend that it's been available.
[time=1746] And the fate of a nation rather expands.
[time=1748] And what the choir has sung for us this morning, thinking of blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.
[time=1755] We have a number of cassettes available.
[time=1757] This one is called significant signs of our times.
[time=1761] Where are we in history?
[time=1762] Those are available at the literature table, which is there.
[time=1765] And we trust that this will be a source of continued blessing to each of us this morning.
[time=1770] Now today, I want us to talk together in response to a question that each of us who lives in the world of the 1980s has been very thoughtful about.
[time=1782] We sense this as a special age.
[time=1784] We sense that more is happening today by accident than once was the case on purpose.
[time=1789] And one need only read the morning newspapers and then compare it with what the Bible says.
[time=1794] And he sees that there's a remarkable similarity between the scripture's description of the end of the age and what is happening in the current scene in our world.
[time=1805] Indeed, we are beginning to suspect that we are those upon whom the end of the worlds have come.
[time=1812] In my opinion, that is a proper suspicion.
[time=1815] Therefore, we are tempted to ask correctly, does God have something special to say to the church in the world of the 1980s?
[time=1825] Does he have a special word relevant to us who live in this present age?
[time=1830] The answer is yes, and it's found in Revelation chapter three.
[time=1835] Revelation chapter three.
[time=1837] We're beginning with verse seven.
[time=1839] We have this special message to the church at Philadelphia.
[time=1843] The church at Philadelphia with very real relevance to the church of our time, page 1355 in your New Schofield Bible, which the Apostle Paul appreciated, and I'm sure that we will too.
[time=1857] Beginning with verse seven of Revelation chapter three.
[time=1862] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, right.
[time=1865] These things sayeth, he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shuteth and shuteth and no man openeth.
[time=1876] I know thy works.
[time=1878] Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it, for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name.
[time=1889] Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie.
[time=1896] Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee.
[time=1903] Because you have kept the word of my patience.
[time=1906] I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them to dwell upon the earth.
[time=1914] Behold, I come quickly, hold fast that which thou hast that no man take thy crown.
[time=1920] Him that overcometh, while I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God.
[time=1929] And the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name.
[time=1938] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit sayeth on to the churches.
[time=1944] Now here is the message of Jesus Christ to the church at Philadelphia.
[time=1950] Let's take a moment to remember where we are in the book of the Revelation.
[time=1955] Revelation chapter one, we have John meeting Christ and seeing a vision of the Lord in his glory.
[time=1963] And he says his eyes were as a flame of fire.
[time=1966] His voice is the sound of many waters.
[time=1970] His countenance as the sun that shines in its strength and out of his mouth proceeds a sharp sword for the judgment of the nations.
[time=1979] Here is a picture of Christ in his glory.
[time=1982] When you contemplate what it will be like to meet Christ, which could be very soon, for any of us, think in terms of Christ in his glory.
[time=1991] It's not useful to think of the stranger of Galilee because now he's the glorified Christ, whose train fills the heavens.
[time=1999] It's an awesome experience to stand before Christ, the judge of history.
[time=2005] Thank God, if you're a Christian, this magnificent being is in fact your friend.
[time=2011] Then we have two chapters in the book of the Revelation, which gives us Christ's message to the seven churches, Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatyrus, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, and the message to the seven churches needs to be understood.
[time=2027] First of all, his message to the seven churches certainly contain admonitions, which apply to any church at many times in its history.
[time=2037] To the church at Ephesus, he said, I know thy works, and thy labor and thy patience, and how thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and are not, but do lie.
[time=2046] And then he goes on to say, but nevertheless, I have summoned against thee because thou hast left thy first love.
[time=2054] Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy candlestick out of its place, leaving your first love.
[time=2067] That's always a danger for any church, or for any Christian individual.
[time=2072] Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip, the Bible says.
[time=2081] That's an admonition, which is very applicable.
[time=2084] But also the message to the seven churches bears a remarkable consonance, a parallel to the unfolding of church history.
[time=2092] And by that standard, which I believe to be a useful one, the message to the church at Philadelphia has particular application, relevance to the church of our time.
[time=2106] We upon whom perhaps the end of the worlds have come.
[time=2110] What does Christ say to the church of our time?
[time=2113] Well, first, he says, these things say a thee that is holy.
[time=2117] He that is true.
[time=2119] He that hath the key of David.
[time=2121] He that opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens.
[time=2127] And what is this message?
[time=2128] This is the message whereby Christ tells the church that God is sovereign, that he presides above history, that he is in charge of everything.
[time=2142] These are days of instability, are they not?
[time=2145] These are days in which it is impossible to look in a horizontal direction and discover something that can be perfectly trusted.
[time=2154] The people of Ohio have recently discovered that it's not possible finally to put your confidence in the savings and loan institutions.
[time=2163] They are discovering that in the state of Maryland as well.
[time=2166] More banks have failed this year so far than in any comparable time since the year 1933.
[time=2174] These are very unstable times.
[time=2176] I defy anyone within the sound of this voice to name one thing on the human scene that is perfectly dependable.
[time=2186] The Bible tells us not to trust it.
[time=2187] That's why the scripture says, the world passes away and the lusts thereof.
[time=2193] Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
[time=2196] We are told in the world you shall have tribulation.
[time=2199] We are told unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.
[time=2206] Beware when all men shall speak well of you for then you shall not be the servant of my Father, which is in heaven.
[time=2213] We have become entirely too optimistic about this world.
[time=2216] There is not one single verse in the Bible.
[time=2220] None that excuses the awful historic optimism which is going in our time.
[time=2226] It's appointed unto men once to die and many times to be sick.
[time=2230] And we live in a world that is most unstable.
[time=2232] So in effect, experience teaches us.
[time=2235] Don't trust in uncertain riches which perish at the using.
[time=2239] Don't trust in the warm approbation of friends.
[time=2243] Don't trust in your own vaunted reputation.
[time=2246] There's a very small difference between who's who and who's that.
[time=2251] That's the way it is in a world like this.
[time=2254] Fame is fleeting as the wind and glory fades away.
[time=2258] It is not possible to intelligently think positively if all that you have to base that thinking on are the things of this world.
[time=2268] That which you can improve by the empirical side of your eyes.
[time=2273] It is not there.
[time=2274] But the Bible tells us that we are to be confident, not in the stability of this world, but in the fact that God presides above it all.
[time=2284] We worship the God who is sovereign.
[time=2287] We worship the God who will not suffer his foot to be moved.
[time=2291] We worship the God who does not slumber, who does not sleep, who is not dead, who is not even in a tedded.
[time=2297] We worship the God who opens and no man closes and closes and no man opens.
[time=2304] Therefore, Thomas Jefferson was correct when he said, there is a just God who presides above the destiny of nations.
[time=2316] He and he alone is the object of our confidence.
[time=2321] If you are trusting, if you are putting your faith in,
[time=2327] anything made out of atoms and molecules, you are bound to be disillusioned finally.
[time=2332] God will see to that.
[time=2334] God will force you, I promise you, to the place where you realize that there is only one sure source of confidence, and that is God alone.
[time=2346] He who has God and many other things, said C.S. Lewis, has no more than he that has God alone.
[time=2355] And that is a truism considered preposterous by the humanists of our time.
[time=2360] But it is eminently true, and he wants us to know it.
[time=2365] God is sovereign.
[time=2366] That's what you are supposed to believe, and nothing else, as far as this world and its stability is concerned.
[time=2375] All right?
[time=2375] Now, having established that proposition-- and by the way, about that proposition, life teaches us that too, doesn't it?
[time=2382] You've heard about the old sea captain sailing his vessel along the New England Sea Coast.
[time=2387] Tremendous storm came up, and the ship was bashed against the rocks and broke to pieces, and the men were thrown into the water and then up on the rock.
[time=2396] Through the night, the waves pounded against the rock, and the winds lashed across the sky.
[time=2402] In the morning they were brought into shore, when the sun came up, the storm passed.
[time=2406] Young man spoke to the old sea captain and said, sir, when you were out on that rock all night, wasn't that a terrible experience?
[time=2413] Didn't you tremble?
[time=2414] And the old man, still with a gleam, and his eyes said, sir.
[time=2418] When I was out on that rock all night, I was scared, and I shook.
[time=2423] But the rock, that was under me.
[time=2428] It never shook, and that's the way it is.
[time=2433] When you are a Christian, you have Christ who does not change.
[time=2438] Now, having said that, he gives us another message, a promise, that grows out of this promise that he presides.
[time=2445] Listen to what he says, I know thy works.
[time=2450] Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it.
[time=2457] Now, what does that mean?
[time=2458] That means, of course, that opportunity comes from God, and it will never fail us so long as our hearts are right with him.
[time=2469] Can I say that again?
[time=2471] Opportunity comes from God.
[time=2473] It will never fail us so long as our hearts are right with him.
[time=2477] Opportunity does not come from the presiding group.
[time=2481] It doesn't come from the Sanhedrin that gives us permission to do something.
[time=2485] It doesn't come from the great denomination or what have you.
[time=2489] It doesn't even come from cooperating circumstances as such.
[time=2493] Opportunity comes from Christ.
[time=2495] And it will not fail us so long as we are right with him.
[time=2498] Young man, young lady, you've been wondering about investing your life.
[time=2503] You've heard of instability out in the world, and you are correct.
[time=2506] But you're wondering, will doors close?
[time=2509] And will I run out of the privilege of investing my life for God?
[time=2514] Will I be forgotten, abandoned on some foreign strand somewhere?
[time=2518] Will finally everything be shut down so they can operate?
[time=2522] The answer is no.
[time=2524] I have set before you an open door, Jesus Christ says.
[time=2530] And he wants us to believe it.
[time=2531] The author of Opportunity is Christ.
[time=2535] And he gives it to you as a very precious gift.
[time=2539] I was thinking about this once upon a time.
[time=2541] I just spent some time in Europe.
[time=2543] And we were involved in what for me was wonderful opportunity.
[time=2547] Great rallies and all of this.
[time=2548] And so I was coming back, and I was thinking for a moment about the opportunities that I'd just been a part of and feeling rather good about it.
[time=2556] I lean back on the soft seat in that high-flying jet airliner above the Atlantic Ocean.
[time=2561] I'd just been served a delightful meal by two attractive steward eye.
[time=2566] And so I was thinking about all of this.
[time=2568] And as I've said, just feeling kind of nice about it all.
[time=2571] And I took the time to write down my own appreciation of this thing called opportunity.
[time=2577] Actually came out in the form of the lines of a few verse, man, flicked upon you a moment of original poetry.
[time=2584] Opportunity, here's the way I feel about it.
[time=2586] The highest wave of any tide breaks only once upon the sand.
[time=2593] Each billow that is subsequent but marks the seas receding hand in lingering, isometric lines etched by the foam upon the shore.
[time=2603] A record written down the beach, a fullness once that is no more does not the sea in this conspire to illustrate God's way with men how life presents one highest hour to make the thrust with sword or pen or value deed or act of love or sacrifice or gift or a word or consecration of this life to serve beside our glorious Lord.
[time=2629] And is it not apparent to the other moments, other days that come beyond that highest hour, though lovely in a hundred ways, do hardly match the quality of privilege and hope, sublime that in our heart of hearts we knew within that pinnacle of time who then can calculate the loss to heaven and earth and in the soul when youthful heart preoccupied says no to God's benign control.
[time=2660] To flound around through wasted years consumed by ravages of sin with a vacant heart and vacuous mind to dream of life that might have been, life that might have been, don't let it happen to you, make it life that is.
[time=2681] And the way you do it is by seeing and using opportunity
[time=2687] and making it happen for his glory.
[time=2689] One of God's most precious gifts is the gift of opportunity.
[time=2695] Don't miss it.
[time=2696] Now quickly he says, behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie, behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee.
[time=2711] What does that mean?
[time=2712] Well, I dare say that few of us have ever heard a sermon on that verse, but let me just say this.
[time=2719] There isn't time to expand upon this thought in the brief one hour and 12 minutes given for me to speak to you this morning, but let me just say this.
[time=2727] We have a philosophy moving, in my opinion, subversively on evangelical Christianity today that says Israel and the church are the same thing.
[time=2737] The church is the kingdom.
[time=2739] It's therefore the duty of the church to build a theocracy.
[time=2742] Its basic message must be the salvation of society as against that of the individual.
[time=2748] Watch out for the idea that the church is spiritual Israel, responsible for producing a theocracy as against the church being the body of Christ, here to bring the message of the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie promised before the world began.
[time=2766] Much more could be said about that, but we shall jump down quickly to verse 10, because you have kept the word of my patience.
[time=2773] I also will keep you from that hour of temptation which will come upon all the world to try them to dwell upon the earth.
[time=2782] Now, what is going to come upon all the world an hour of temptation, an hour of trial, an hour of tribulation?
[time=2790] What's coming upon the world?
[time=2792] An era that the Bible speaks of called the great tribulation.
[time=2797] That's the point to which history is moving.
[time=2801] That will be the awful fate of the things of time.
[time=2805] Tribulation is coming upon the world.
[time=2807] Now, I realize that you and I who received a part of our education compliments of the educational system of America, we were told another story.
[time=2816] We were told that man began in the La Brea pits of the past.
[time=2820] And he was once a unicellular creature who grew from the primordial slime and all of those other appetizing antecedents for man, you understand.
[time=2830] And then we were told that the story of history is the story of progress.
[time=2833] And those who told us this then couldn't help saying that this is the best age that ever was.
[time=2839] And then they went on to say we can anticipate that man will produce, if we draw dotted line out into the future, a marvelous utopia, a perfect society.
[time=2850] Evolution is bringing us to that wonderful point.
[time=2854] I've listened with interest to this story, done some writing on it myself.
[time=2858] And as far as evolution is concerned, I considered a very fascinating point of view, but with one problem.
[time=2864] It's entirely unsupported by the facts, not supported by the facts of science, not supported by the facts of history, not supported by our present experience, and certainly unsupported by the word of God.
[time=2878] How did man begin according to scripture?
[time=2881] He began in a utopia, and the name of that place was the Garden of Eden.
[time=2886] He was not some in co-eight monster.
[time=2888] He was a very sophisticated, able to name all of the beasts of the field.
[time=2893] There are 600 kind of mosquitoes in the world for openers.
[time=2897] Think of how intelligent man must have been.
[time=2901] So God created Adam and Eve in innocence, but in innocent perfection.
[time=2907] And it was God's intention that Adam and Eve produce a beautiful destiny in the world.
[time=2912] But you know the story of something that happened.
[time=2915] His infernal majesty, the devil in the form of a serpent, came into the garden.
[time=2920] He had a little conversation with Eve, and he spoke to her most beguilingly and said, "Hey, baby, do I have a deal for you?" Let's talk together, shall we?
[time=2932] Now God is a big tyrant in heaven.
[time=2934] And so you ought to go it alone.
[time=2936] Eve set up shop on your own beyond autonomous.
[time=2939] You can be like a God.
[time=2941] You don't need that distant person.
[time=2943] Where is he anyway?
[time=2945] And all of the rest of it.
[time=2946] Well, one thing led to another.
[time=2948] You know the story.
[time=2949] Eve reached out a hand, trembling with heinous anticipation.
[time=2953] And she took that forbidden fruit and she ate.
[time=2956] She gave to Adam and he also ate.
[time=2958] So the scripture says by one man.
[time=2960] Sin entered the world in death by sin.
[time=2963] And so death passed upon all men for that all have sin.
[time=2968] And that's the way it started in the Garden of Eden.
[time=2972] Now you and I who are intelligent readers of the New Testament, we know something the world doesn't know, don't we?
[time=2978] We know that Eve sinned for a different reason than dead Adam.
[time=2981] Eve being deceived was in the transgression but Adam was not deceived.
[time=2985] Now perhaps we don't have to expand on that lest we be picketed this morning by such people as Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, Bella Abzug, Madeleine Murray and some of the other lovelies of our time.
[time=2998] You understand.
[time=2999] But what happened was that this disease called sin
[time=3005] began infecting society in those days.
[time=3009] So is the story of history, the story of progress?
[time=3012] It is not.
[time=3013] The story of history is the story of progressive decadence.
[time=3016] It's the story of what degeneration will do.
[time=3019] The story of history is kind of like this.
[time=3021] Is this the best world that ever was?
[time=3023] Well by any statistic by which iniquity can be measured and the moral state of society is the only valid measurement because the basis of life is moral in that the universe was made by a God who is holy.
[time=3037] Correct, remember your Christian theology by any way that iniquity can be measured, this is the worst world that ever was.
[time=3044] And what's more the Bible says is gonna get worse than that.
[time=3047] Evil men and seducers shall well become worse and worse deceiving and being deceived.
[time=3052] So there's coming to pass a time in which man treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God when men shall see the great tribulation come upon him.
[time=3065] Now we Christians who read about this in the Bible and also when we read the morning newspapers and see what is happening within society we can be forgiven for asking the question what about us?
[time=3077] What about the church?
[time=3078] Will the church go through the dreadful things of the great tribulation?
[time=3082] Will we come under the awful hegemony of the antichrist?
[time=3086] Well, look what the Bible says because you have kept the word of my patience.
[time=3090] I'll keep you from that hour of temptation which will come upon all the world.
[time=3095] What does the Bible say?
[time=3097] It says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel, with the trump of God.
[time=3104] The dead in Christ shall rise first.
[time=3106] We who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[time=3111] And so shall we ever be with the Lord, therefore comfort one another with these words.
[time=3117] And what's that the promise of?
[time=3119] It's the promise of the taking up of the church where we will meet Christ in the air so as to ever be with the Lord.
[time=3126] Now look, we've announced a service tonight at the church.
[time=3129] There'll be a Wednesday night meeting.
[time=3131] We've announced services next Sunday but I'm here to tell you that those meetings may not take place in this auditorium.
[time=3138] They may take place in that greater Blackhawk Baptist church at the corner of Glory Avenue and Hallelujah Street over there.
[time=3147] So look, if you come to church next Sunday morning and there is nobody here, except our beloved Pete Cody, you understand.
[time=3155] (congregation laughing) There's nobody here.
[time=3159] Well, what may it happen?
[time=3161] A number of things perhaps, but one possibility.
[time=3164] Christ may have come to take his own home to be with himself.
[time=3169] That's the blessed hope of the church.
[time=3171] That's the object of our anticipation, a promise given to the church in this lovely passage of the New Testament, the promise of the return of Christ and the deliverance of the church from the great tribulation.
[time=3188] Now, having said that, then he says to us, "Behold, I come quickly." That means all of a sudden, just like that, I will be here in the twinkling of an eye.
[time=3198] But then a word of admonition, hold fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.
[time=3206] You know, the church today has something.
[time=3210] There are people here today that can remember when if you called yourself a fundamentalist 30, 40 years ago, in all probability you were thought of as meeting in a tar paper shack at the edge of town somewhere.
[time=3222] Few little old ladies in tennis shoes in the front row and that was it, but the great denominations, the counselor movements had the large churches downtown.
[time=3233] Well, let me tell you something, it's not that way anymore.
[time=3236] Believing Christians have sold the chickens and moved to the city, as it were.
[time=3240] And the great denominations are falling apart.
[time=3244] Time would fail to give you a thorough going analysis of that this morning, but just let me tell you, that the great denominations, and you know who they are, some of you are alumni of those now decadent institutions.
[time=3256] Their contributions have gone down by the millions of dollars.
[time=3259] So have their memberships.
[time=3261] Now, it couldn't happen to nicer people, in my opinion, but that's the way it is in the present Christian world.
[time=3267] But what does that mean?
[time=3269] That means that here is where the action is.
[time=3272] It's the fundamentalists, the conservative evangelical coalition, the new force in America.
[time=3277] We have the great buildings, and you're contemplating building one of days to come.
[time=3282] We have the people, the young people, the media, the treasuries, we are rich and increased with goods by comparison to what it used to be in the old days.
[time=3291] That's good, but it's also dangerous.
[time=3293] We are the team to beat.
[time=3295] So the Bible says, "Don't let anybody steal your crown." It's not only necessary to preach the gospel positively and say, "Come to Christ." But it's also necessary to announce, "Be sober, be vigilant.
[time=3309] You're at Vasari, the devil, as a roaring lion.
[time=3313] Goeth about seeking whom he may what?
[time=3315] Have a cup of tea with, and talk about the blessed virtues of ecumenism?
[time=3320] No, seeking whom he may devour." The Bible says there's a vicious, spectral monster that walks through this world, and he would like to destroy what you through prayer and sacrifice have built up.
[time=3336] "Don't let it happen!" The Bible says, "Let no man steal thy crown.
[time=3341] Learn what a cult is.
[time=3342] Listen to the apostle Paul." When he says, "After my departing shell, grievous wolves enter in, not spurring the flock enough.
[time=3349] Your own self shall mannerize, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples.
[time=3354] After them, therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every one of you night and day with tears.
[time=3362] Don't let it happen!" The Bible says.
[time=3364] And then a final word of marvelous promise to the church.
[time=3368] "Him that overcometh, while I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out.
[time=3374] And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name." I will write upon him my new name.
[time=3388] Have you thought of that question this morning?
[time=3391] What is your name?
[time=3395] Well, my name is Mary.
[time=3397] My name is George.
[time=3399] My name is Charles.
[time=3401] My name is Octavia.
[time=3403] Octavia, what are you doing here?
[time=3405] You should be back in ancient Rome somewhere.
[time=3408] My name is Sean.
[time=3410] Everybody's name, Sean, these days.
[time=3413] What is your name?
[time=3416] Can I give you a word that you want to think about?
[time=3418] That's not your real name.
[time=3421] That's the name your parents gave you when you were born.
[time=3424] Back in the Old Testament, parents prayed, "What is the name of my child?" And they asked God about it.
[time=3430] Not done so much today.
[time=3431] Well, let me tell you something.
[time=3433] A name is a package of destiny and that new name.
[time=3437] The God puts upon you.
[time=3438] I promise you, it will be an absolutely perfect description of the individual whom you truly are.
[time=3446] What will that name be?
