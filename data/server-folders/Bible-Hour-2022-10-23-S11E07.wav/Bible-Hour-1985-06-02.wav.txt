[time=30] [MUSIC - 169 seconds]
[time=203] Thank you, you may be seated. We have an anchor of the soul that is steadfast and sure. We welcome you to our service today in the absence of our pastor, Rick Hawks, who is on vacation. We look forward to him coming back to us next week. We welcome all of our viewers by the way of the Bible hour and glad that you're with us today. We look forward to praising the Lord together.
[time=228] As mentioned earlier and later on in the program even we'll be talking about a booklet entitled Hope by Charles Swindall. If you've not read that book it's a great book when things seem to be closing in on you and you wonder if the things of the world are just greater than what you can comprehend. So I trust today that as we talk about the solid rock Jesus Christ that you'll be with us and you'll stay with us as we worship together in this sanctuary.
[time=256] The choir is going to sing a song now, a very moving piece. There'll be a time coming when God's going to come and take away all the tears. We have difficulties and troubles in this world. We look forward to the day when he returns for us and he'll wipe away all the tears and the pain and the sorrow that we experience here on this earth. God shall wipe away all tears.
[time=276] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first heaven and the first heaven.
[time=305] And the first earth were passed away.
[time=313] And there was no more sea, no more sea, no more sea.
[time=374] We know that ever and ever God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God, and shall be their men, and be their God.
[time=404] God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
[time=433] There shall be no more death, there shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more crying, no pain.
[time=448] There shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more crying, no pain.
[time=477] Oh, for the poor and things have passed away forever and ever gone, forever and ever so, forever and ever gone.
[time=492] For ever and ever for God himself shall be with men, and be their God.
[time=512] Forever and ever gone.
[time=521] God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
[time=542] We have a blessed hope, don't we? My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=551] Let's sing together him #423. We'll sing the first and fourth stanzas. I'm going to ask you again to stand with me, will you, as we sing, him #423.
[time=567] God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
[time=583] For Christ has fallen, but there's been no other ground we'll sing each other, no other ground we'll sing each other.
[time=597] These are all there from the storm, oh, may I thank him in the cup, as him is not just us alone, oh, what's his name, who I've known.
[time=613] Oh, there's the star in the promise here, oh, all the ground we'll sing each other.
[time=629] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=634] Today we have certain guests with us, we welcome our visitors, we're glad also to have graduates who have graduated from the area of schools.
[time=641] John Sootch is going to come and honor those graduates right now.
[time=646] It's my privilege to share with you the names of the 1985 graduates that belong to our church, and if you turn to the back of your bulletin, you can follow along as I read that list.
[time=657] Graduating from high school this year, Sheila Boggs, Derek Brown, Lance Clark, Tammy Craig, Becky Darrow, Vicki Evans, Lori Flowers, Rich Galbraith, Tina Glass, Dan Godfrey, Dan Gunnerman, Andy Haberle, David Hackley, Todd Hill, Tim Johnson, Andrea Kinsey, Jane Kirschner, Tony Lido, Michelle Liston, Troy Lutzenheiser,
[time=686] Mike Mansfield, Carrie Mertz, Lee Norris, Karen Peters, Matt Rang, Tanya Saunders, Steve Seagland, Cindy Smith, Ricky Stevens, Jay Stewart, Tanya Vonderlon, Missy Vickery, Dave Ward, Troy Wells, and Laura Yovan.

[time=728] With an associate's degree, Dave Haman, Patty Jeffers, Karen Johnson, Susan Modder, and Susan Mishler, and with a master's degree, Sandra Castor.
[time=741] If you're one of these names, would you please stand so that we could recognize you this morning?
[time=746] Many of these friends were in the first service due to being in high school.
[time=751] Would you give these to a hand?
[time=753] [APPLAUSE]
[time=761] I'd just like to remind those 85 graduates that we have a gift, our way of saying congratulations, for completing this part of the education in your lives.
[time=771] Would you join me in praying for these graduates?
[time=774] Our Father, we want to thank you this morning for the lives of the names that are represented here, and the new beginning in life that they are having.
[time=784] May you use the education that they've gained to bring glory to yourself.
[time=788] May they see the study and the hard work that they've done be used for your glory in their lives.
[time=796] Thank you for them, and thank you for your faithfulness, which perfectly takes care of each of us every day. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=808] Thank you, John. We're very proud of our graduates and delighted that they're a part of our church family.
[time=814] Just a reminder to you that Ron Hackett, who often helps us, in fact, led a couple of weeks ago, the music is in the hospital today.
[time=823] I want you to continue to pray that the doctors will have wisdom as to whether to operate or not, and just remember Ron in prayer as he's going through some pain right now.
[time=831] Also, we have some very exciting news concerning Mary Lantman.
[time=836] I know that many of you have been praying very faithfully for Mary and her bout with cancer.
[time=841] We found out about cancer in her body last September.
[time=844] She underwent an extensive operation, has since gone through chemotherapy and radiation.
[time=851] She's taken the maximum amount that any one person can take.
[time=856] In her time with the doctor last Wednesday, the doctor said that he felt very definitely that the cancer was in remission.
[time=864] We need to thank the Lord for that, but let me remind you to say that we need to continue praying for Mary.
[time=870] In about a month, she'll have further tests to just determine exactly the extent of the cancer in her body.
[time=875] We want to thank you, and Mary and George, thank you for the faithfulness in praying.
[time=880] Thank you too for Mary and her ability to stand up under trying circumstances and also their faith in God.
[time=887] It's a great testimony to all of us, so continue to pray for Mary and George Lantman during this time.
[time=893] We'd like to introduce to you now Marilyn Wong.
[time=896] As you recall, Marilyn was with the church several years ago and then moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and is now back with us with her husband Kurt.
[time=903] We do appreciate the musical ministry of Marilyn.
[time=905] We're going to ask her to sing for us right now.
[time=907] Listen to that song and the prospects that we have for the future life with the Lord as she sings a song entitled "Finally Home."
[time=915] Marilyn?
[time=927] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=1075] Good morning and thank you again for tuning into the Bible Hour.
[time=1085] We're always happy when we hear from the viewers that listen each week to the Bible Hour.
[time=1090] And this week I took the opportunity to go down and specifically choose a couple letters from our listeners.
[time=1096] They're always exciting to us, George, when people write into us.
[time=1099] And we're going to share just a couple of the letters that we re-receive this week.
[time=1103] The first one says, "Thanks for timeless insights each month. They are very helpful.
[time=1108] Also keep up the good work in the All-American City and on your TV program."
[time=1114] George, you have one from a super 60s, I believe.
[time=1117] Yes, it reaches all ages people, and even into a nursing home.
[time=1122] This letter says, "I am 94 years old. I'm entering a nursing home.
[time=1126] I will continue to watch the Bible Hour, which is a blessing to me." Oh, that's great. And then one more. It says, "It's so good to see and hear you again after we get home from church.
[time=1135] Now that the time has changed, we enjoy your services so much and may the Lord continue to bless us."
[time=1141] And we do welcome those people that have the opportunity now in Ohio and Michigan to watch the program after they've attended their regular church services.
[time=1149] George, we talked about a trip coming up very soon.
[time=1154] And we talked about it last week, something about Greece and Israel and the Mediterranean.
[time=1159] Sounds like a very exciting trip. Tell us a little bit about it.
[time=1162] Yes, this is one of the many trips that the super 60s takes, Pete.
[time=1166] And I'm excited about this trip because it's going to include not only Israel, Greece, and Egypt, but also follow Paul's missionary trip through Corinth, Rhodes, Cyprus,
[time=1177] and ended up on Patmos where John wrote the book of Revelation.
[time=1182] And it's going to be exciting, I think, to do that, to just follow where Paul went and also to follow the footsteps of Christ,
[time=1189] right on through the different areas where he knows apostles worked and lived and actually ministered.
[time=1196] Now, I've heard you advertise this in the super 60s programs that we have every Friday morning.
[time=1201] Is it extended to those people beyond the regular attenders of the super 60s program, George?
[time=1207] Yes, it is. In fact, we have a number of people signed up now, but it's limited to adults, Pete.
[time=1213] And the cost is $2095 from New York, double occupancy.
[time=1218] And we get the bus filled up. That'll be it. We're coming very close to that now.
[time=1223] So I would encourage anybody who would want to go on this trip to sign up now.
[time=1227] It's August the 9th to the 23rd.
[time=1230] Well, it sounds like a very exciting trip and one that will be very informative concerning the relationship to the Scriptures, the Word of God.
[time=1238] And we remind you again to write to the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1242] And the address is 7321 East State Boulevard, or you can call the church at 749-8524.
[time=1250] And do that immediately because the spaces are filling up very rapidly.
[time=1256] Just a few weeks ago, George, we had the opportunity to go to a gospel concert here in town.
[time=1262] And it was a very uplifting and exciting concert.
[time=1265] And when we got home, our boy met us in the hall, and he told us about a tragic accident of our nephew.
[time=1271] He was killed by a motorcyclist.
[time=1274] And that was a time when we had just come from great jubilation to a tremendous blast that hit us.
[time=1280] It made us realize that at times it's very difficult to cope.
[time=1284] You know, when sometimes your hope wears thin and you realize that there are times when you just really wonder whether you can survive the things that the world is throwing at you.
[time=1293] I'd like to recommend to you a book entitled "Hope" by Charles Swindall.
[time=1298] We're offering that on the Bible hour because we think it's a great encouragement to all.
[time=1302] You can receive this booklet entitled "Hope" by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1310] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=1313] And we encourage you to write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1322] George, we were listening to some music before we went on the insert that talked about America.
[time=1327] And already it's that time when we need to mention the patriotic panorama.
[time=1331] This is the 12th annual patriotic panorama by the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1335] And we want to inform you that that will be June 30th at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
[time=1341] Tickets are available now. They are free, but you need a ticket to enter the auditorium that evening.
[time=1347] You can write to us at the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815, or again call the church at 749-8524 for tickets.
[time=1359] Please do that soon as the program does fill up very rapidly.
[time=1363] We're glad again that you tuned in and I want to encourage you to write to us and tell us what's happening in your life.
[time=1369] And especially to write for this very timely booklet entitled "Hope" by Charles Swindall.
[time=1375] We'd like to give you the address one more time so that you can have it and then please write us and request that booklet entitled "Hope".
[time=1383] George, would you give the address?
[time=1385] Yes, I think I will and that's a exciting book to Peter and they can get this booklet by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1395] Let me say that again, Peter. That's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1415] Every day they pass me by. I can see it in their eyes.
[time=1433] Lonely people filled with fear, headed who knows where.
[time=1446] On they go through private bed, living fear to fear.
[time=1459] Laughter hides their silent cries. Only Jesus hears.
[time=1473] People need the Lord.
[time=1486] At the end of broken dreams, he's the open door.
[time=1500] People need the Lord.
[time=1513] When will we realize, people need the Lord?
[time=1537] We are called to take his word to a world where all seems right.
[time=1550] What could be too great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost?
[time=1563] Through his love our hearts can feel all the grief they bear.
[time=1576] They must hear the words of life. Only we can share.
[time=1590] People need the Lord.
[time=1603] At the end of broken dreams, he's the open door.
[time=1617] People need the Lord.
[time=1623] People need the Lord. When will we realize?
[time=1636] We need to give our lives for people need?
[time=1648] The Lord.
[time=1658] People need the Lord.
[time=1688] Thank you, Pete Coby, for that reminder. People need the Lord.
[time=1698] I trust that your heart has been blessed and uplifted as mine has through the Minister of Music.
[time=1704] And now as our pastor and his wife and family are vacationing, we have the opportunity of a school not too far from us.
[time=1714] And we have Dr. John Sproul with us today. He's no new face to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1720] And we're happy that he's come today to minister to us. He is the head of the Department of New Testament Biblical Teaching.
[time=1730] And we trust that your heart will be blessed as our heart was blessed during the first service as he comes.
[time=1736] Let's give him a Black Hawk welcome as he comes. Dr. John Sproul.
[time=1740] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1749] Thank you, George, and thank you, folks. That was great.
[time=1761] I love good music, and we've had some beautifully music this morning, just words that met so very much and good quality music along with it.
[time=1769] I want to thank Peter and Marilyn and the choir and all of you for participating in that and making it such a glorious thing.
[time=1777] Open your Bibles, please, to Luke 23, Luke 23.
[time=1785] This is one of the accounts of our Lord's crucifixion and some of the characters who were involved in that event.
[time=1795] They are unnamed characters, but we want to look at one of those individuals today.
[time=1803] Beginning at verse 32 of Luke 23, there were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death.
[time=1820] And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
[time=1831] Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."
[time=1839] Now, probably the translation "forgive them" is maybe a little misleading.
[time=1845] It probably wasn't precisely like that. The word can be used for forgive, but it has a wide semantic range.
[time=1853] And most likely, the Lord at this point was praying something like, to say it very literally, "Father, permit them, or Father, allow them."
[time=1863] The word most often is translated like that.
[time=1866] And so probably what he was saying was something like this, "Father, allow them a day of grace, or don't bring judgment now.
[time=1876] Allow them an opportunity to reverse this decision." And so probably in the final analysis, this was a prayer for folks like you and me.
[time=1886] It was a prayer for God's grace, or a day of grace.
[time=1891] Now let me read on then, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do, and they divided his garments and cast lots.
[time=1898] And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying he saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
[time=1909] And the soldiers also mocked him, coming and offering him sour wine, and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."
[time=1917] And an inscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.
[time=1923] This is the King of the Jews.
[time=1926] Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed him saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us."
[time=1936] But the other, by the way, keep in mind, both of these dying thieves have been previously cursing Christ.
[time=1949] They have both been railing against him.
[time=1953] Now one says, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us." Then in verse 40 the other, "But the other answering rebuked him, saying, 'Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?'
[time=1967] And we indeed, justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.
[time=1975] Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come and do your kingdom."
[time=1982] Now I want to pause also for a moment here and stress why I am using the word "Lord" here when in some of your translations it reads Jesus.
[time=1991] I've been reading from the New King James Version translation, and you may be reading from a New American Standard Bible, or an NIV, or maybe a King James.
[time=2000] And there is what is called a variant reading here in the Greek text.
[time=2005] I prefer to see the reading as being correct to read "Lord." I think that has enough witnesses to support it, enough geographical distribution to support "Lord."
[time=2015] And I'm going to make something other in a moment, and that's the reason I'm pausing right now, and explaining why I'm reading it like that.
[time=2021] Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come and do your kingdom."
[time=2027] And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."
[time=2034] Now let's pause right there and have a moment of prayer.
[time=2037] My Father, I pray for divine enablement to preach this morning.
[time=2042] We have to have a lot of things that we want to say, and we need Father your grace and your help.
[time=2049] And a lot of things about the Lord Jesus Christ that needs to be heard, our Father, that need to be heard.
[time=2054] And Father, enable us to say the right things, to preach.
[time=2058] Father, those things that need to be preached and give us an open heart this morning, our Father.
[time=2063] To listen to the Word of God, allow the Holy Spirit to have His ministry among us.
[time=2068] We thank you, our Father, for the Savior who died the death that brings death its death.
[time=2074] May we not forget Him, and as we think about Him this morning, our Father, and these two who are crucified with Him.
[time=2080] May we behold again our Father, some of the marvel of your grace as you work in the life of one of these individuals.
[time=2091] Thank you, Father, for your goodness to us. Take charge of the service and you'll be happy with it.
[time=2097] We ask it in the Savior's name. Amen.
[time=2102] Why would one man hanging upon the cross and dying turn to another man who is also hanging upon the cross and dying and ask that man for help?
[time=2115] Have you ever thought about that?
[time=2119] Someone has said that the dying thief, referring to the one who ultimately turns to the Lord, that the dying thief was the noblest theologians at that point.
[time=2131] He knew more at that point than the apostle Peter.
[time=2135] He saw more at that point than the one who was known for seeing visions, the apostle John.
[time=2143] Furthermore, he was a criminal. He was a thief.
[time=2150] When our Lord came into the world, He lay amidst the shepherds, the magi, and the venerable guests from the temple in Jerusalem because of the overflow.
[time=2163] But now as our Lord prepares to depart from the earthly scene, He hangs between two bandits, two criminals, two thieves.
[time=2176] Someone has said, and rightly so, that this was his inevitable company to hang amid the bandits because you see he dies there as a representative of folks like you and me.
[time=2187] He dies there for bandits and for criminals and those who need redemption.
[time=2194] And so it was indeed inevitable that he must take his place as he departs the earthly scene amid the bandits.
[time=2204] We cannot fully appreciate the section that we have just read unless we come to some idea of how horrifying and terrible a Roman crucifixion really was.
[time=2217] Probably the nails were driven up into the hands but into the wrists and then down through the feet.
[time=2225] And in order for the man or the victim to stay alive, he would just sort of scoot along that cross and try to allow room for his diaphragm to allow him to breathe, to get air into his lungs.
[time=2238] And in the midst of all of that agony, he would scoot up and down on that cross.
[time=2246] And until finally the Roman soldiers would notice this and they would come over and break his legs so he could no longer scoot up and down and he would simply die in the bath of his own blood, suffocation.
[time=2262] And the victims were men who cursed a great deal. They were angry at that point with just about everyone.
[time=2274] And as they were being nailed to those crosses, they would curse their gods, they would curse their judges, they would curse their friends, and they would curse their foes.
[time=2286] And so you see, this is the scene that we open up upon this morning as we read again the event of our Lord's dying and those who died with him.
[time=2300] It is also true that we know really very little about their identity upon which we can rely.
[time=2307] I have a favorite preacher who preaches often on television and I have heard him preach on this text and he gives names to these two thieves.
[time=2316] Now that's all right, tradition assigns names to them but we really do not know from the text who they were.
[time=2323] And so we'll refer to this one who ultimately turned simply as the dying thief.
[time=2329] They are unidentified. This was the way of the evangelists who wrote our gospels. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John, they did not bother with a lot of the details that you and I perhaps would prefer.
[time=2342] But they were interested in the main feature of the event and they did not supply a lot of details.
[time=2350] Not unlike an account I heard of years ago when a friend of mine, Dr. Lewis Johnson, who was an avid football fan, went to a football game down in Birmingham, Alabama.
[time=2363] He was an avid fan of the Crimson Tide and they were having their annual game with Auburn.
[time=2369] It was one of those grudge games, as it always is.
[time=2373] And Lewis had taken his wife married to the ball game and along with them, another couple, a man and his wife.
[time=2379] And sometime during the game, the quarterback called the right play and he handed the ball off to a half back or running back.
[time=2386] And there was a hole in the line and that running back went through the hole and he was headed towards the goal line and running as fast as he could run.
[time=2393] And 60,000 people jumped to their feet screaming and yelling and cheering.
[time=2398] And right in the middle of all of that bedlam, Lewis said he could hear his wife talk to the other lady and say, Agnes, look at that crazy hat on that woman down there.
[time=2407] Well, the evangelists were not like that. They were not interested in crazy hats or details.
[time=2414] And so we really do not have the names of these two dying things.
[time=2418] There's something else that we ought to note about this great text and this great event.
[time=2426] It used to be taught in our Sunday schools and perhaps still is.
[time=2431] A great typical lesson, a great lesson of representation.
[time=2437] The teacher I can recall would go over to a blackboard or perhaps a chalkboard or maybe a flannel graph board and she would draw three crosses.
[time=2448] The one on the center cross or the one on the center cross of course was the Lord Jesus Christ and the two thieves on either side.
[time=2454] And over one of the crosses she would write three words in and on.
[time=2463] And then she would go to the center cross and she would write three other words she would write on not in over that center cross.
[time=2473] And then over the third cross, the cross of the thief who eventually turned to the Lord, she would write in not on.
[time=2483] And that's a great lesson and we have it right here in front of us.
[time=2487] That one thief who never turned died in all of his sin, cursing Christ.
[time=2496] Sin was in him and furthermore sin was upon him and he died like that.
[time=2504] The center cross, the sin was Savior, on not in sin was not in Jesus Christ.
[time=2512] He was the sinless Son of God.
[time=2515] But sin was upon him as he bore the sins of men and died the death that wrought death its ultimate death.
[time=2523] And then that third cross of the one who did turn, in not on because sin was still in the man, he still was a sinner.
[time=2533] But it was no longer upon him because Jesus Christ as he turns to him will now pay the price for that dying thief's sin.
[time=2548] The dying thief was the noblest theologian of his day.
[time=2554] He knew more than the apostle Peter.
[time=2557] He saw more than the one who saw visions, the apostle John.
[time=2562] Why would one man hang up on the cross and dying turn to another man who's also hanging up on the cross and also dying and ask him for help?
[time=2574] The day started, I'm sure in a very bad way for these two men.
[time=2582] Awakening that morning in a Roman prison, dirty, angry, doomed to die, and filled with curses.
[time=2595] And then taken out to that cross, or their crosses, nailed to the crosses.
[time=2600] And then after they had been nailed to the crosses, the crosses raised upright and those crosses then plunged into a hole in the ground with a sickening thud.
[time=2611] And those bodies riding up on the cross and crying out vile curses.
[time=2619] And then at a certain point in this event, one of those thieves, the one who does not turn to the Lord for salvation, one of those thieves asks the impossible request.
[time=2631] Did you catch it? There in verse 39, then one of the criminals who were hanging blasphemed him saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us."
[time=2643] If he only had known, that was the one impossible thing.
[time=2648] Jesus Christ cannot save anyone by coming off of a cross.
[time=2653] He has to remain on the cross.
[time=2655] That's the only way he can save anyone.
[time=2658] What an impossible request. Come off of the cross and save us. You cannot save anyone that way.
[time=2664] Jesus Christ had to die that death to save any man.
[time=2674] And then as they are spewing out their venom against Christ and the crowd and all the others, one of those thieves begins to have a change of heart.
[time=2686] And I believe he begins to notice things like this.
[time=2693] Of course, God the Holy Spirit is working within the man.
[time=2698] But he begins to notice that even though he's cursing everyone and his companion over here is also cursing, this one on the center cross is not cursing anyone.
[time=2710] In fact, he appears to be very quiet. He is not reviling anyone. Years later, Peter will write that when he was reviled, he reviled not again.
[time=2723] And that somehow attracts the attention of this one dying thief.
[time=2728] And now God begins a work in his heart that we ought not to overlook.
[time=2733] And I suggest this morning that these four or five things that I will mention are things that will happen in the life of any individual who as a lost individual comes to his spiritual senses and turns to the Lord Jesus Christ and places his faith in him, whom to know is to have eternal life.
[time=2757] Notice the very first thing that happens to this man, suddenly he becomes aware of the fear of God, this one who just moments before has been cursing Christ with his companion.
[time=2772] Verse 39 again, "Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed him saying, 'If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.'"
[time=2780] But the other answering rebuked him saying, "Do you not even fear God? Why moments before? He hasn't been fearing God either. But now the fear of God has gripped his heart."
[time=2792] You see, he has come to the realization that ultimately he must face God, whether he believes in God or not, he ultimately must face him, and he's about to go through that door right now.
[time=2806] And God has produced within him an awesomeness or a sense of God's awesomeness.
[time=2811] And this man has been brought to a genuine fear of God.
[time=2815] The Bible says over and over again that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and indeed it is.
[time=2823] And this man has taken that first step. Do you not even fear God?
[time=2830] Now he does. And then the second thing happens to him.
[time=2835] Do you not even fear God seeing you under the same condemnation?
[time=2841] Now notice, verse 41, "And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds." How about that?
[time=2850] Not only does he have the fear of God in his soul, but he has brought under the conviction of his own sins, this one who awoke that morning in a stinking Roman prison.
[time=2859] This one who has been cursing God and foes and friends.
[time=2863] Suddenly he is aware of his own condemnation, his own sin.
[time=2867] He says, "We deserve to be on these crosses, but this one doesn't. We deserve to be here."
[time=2876] His conscience is beginning to work. God, of course, behind that conscience.
[time=2882] Now I fully understand that the conscience is not always an infallible guide, but every man has one.
[time=2888] And even though a man might claim to be an atheist or an agnostic, maybe he has sublimated his conscience, but there is always that conscience.
[time=2897] Knowing away, ultimately you must face God. Ultimately you must face God over and over again.
[time=2905] You see, you cannot get rid of God. You must ultimately one day face him.
[time=2910] I don't care who you are today. All the money you must face him.
[time=2916] And this dying thief has come to that realization.
[time=2922] And so God has produced within his heart a fear of Jehovah.
[time=2926] He has brought under the conviction of his own sins. He realizes that he is a lost man.
[time=2933] Rightly and deservedly so. Now, notice the third thing.
[time=2940] That's part of verse 41. "But this man, by contrast, has done nothing wrong."
[time=2946] Well, how did he know that? He's just been cursing him.
[time=2955] You see what's happened?
[time=2958] As God the Holy Spirit works in his life, not only does he have in his own soul the sense of God's awesomeness, a rightful fear of Jehovah.
[time=2970] Not only is he under the conviction of his own sins, but he has brought to a place where he realizes suddenly who Jesus Christ really is.
[time=2981] Furthermore, he is convinced of the sinlessness and the innocence of that one who hangs upon that sin across.
[time=2989] We deserve to be here, he says. We deserve all that we're getting, but not this one.
[time=2995] This man has done nothing wrong.
[time=3000] And then an amazing thing happens.
[time=3004] He calls him Corrios, or Lord.
[time=3010] That was a word that you would use if you were translating the old Hebrew, Yahweh, or Jehovah, or the Tetragrammaton, into Greek.
[time=3018] Corrios, Lord, Jehovah would be a good way of translating it.
[time=3026] And so now this dying thief who has just been cursing Christ turns to him and says, Lord, Corrios, remember me.
[time=3039] Where in heaven's name did he get that information?
[time=3046] We're not really sure. Probably he was a brilliant young man of that day, perhaps called up in one of the revolutions of the uprisings.
[time=3057] And perhaps he had heard the crowd as they milled around the feet of the cross, throwing up their taunts to Christ and calling him Jehovah.
[time=3064] If you really are Jehovah, why don't you come down? You claim to be Jehovah the Son, why don't you come down?
[time=3069] You claim to be Lord, why don't you come down?
[time=3072] And perhaps he heard that. Or maybe it was a superscription, but all these things put together somehow worked in this man's heart and he was able to identify who this one really was.
[time=3083] It was hanging up on that cross. He was Corrios.
[time=3088] That is the word that you would use for the covenant keeping God of Israel. And there he hangs, Corrios.
[time=3095] Have you ever thought of the reversals that that man's cry brought about when he cried out, Corrios or Lord?
[time=3106] With that cry he reversed the opinion of the Jewish court.
[time=3112] With that cry he reversed the high priest's decision. With that cry he reversed the opinion or the judgment of the howling mob.
[time=3123] And with that cry he reversed the judgment of the friends of Jesus for when the chips were down and when it really got down to the nasty business of the cross, all of those who were following Christ fled and left him.
[time=3140] And now left behind in this horrifying scene is one man, a dying thief who will turn and identify by testimony the one who really hangs there, Corrios, Lord.
[time=3156] Remember me.
[time=3160] Peter has already fled.
[time=3163] He at this point would not dare to come back and plant his feet on Mount Calvary and say to that crowd, stop it. Don't crucify him. He's Corrios. Don't do that to him.
[time=3173] Peter has already left.
[time=3178] So have the other friends of Jesus, but in this dying hour the father does not leave the son comfortless because he will have going with him as a testimony into paradise that very day, a dying thief.
[time=3198] What a marvelous scene. Something else. When he turns, I don't know how you would react if you were there. I don't know how I would react. I think I would be totally out of my senses.
[time=3211] But he doesn't just see a man hanging there. He sees God hanging there from that tree.
[time=3219] Lord, Jehovah, remember me. Furthermore, he sees God reigning from a tree. He's going to talk about a kingdom in just a moment.
[time=3235] And so God has produced in his soul a fear of Jehovah. He has brought him under the conviction of his own sins. He knows that he is dying justly.
[time=3247] Furthermore, he knows who this one is or this one to whom he is speaking. Who he is. He is Jehovah. He is sinless. He is innocent.
[time=3259] And amazing of all, or most amazing of all, he knows that he has a kingdom. All that in the space of just a few moments.
[time=3271] And now a fourth thing happens. Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom. Do you see what's happened? This one who has just been cursing Christ.
[time=3289] He has now been brought to the realization that there really is life after death. He has come to be a believer in life after death.
[time=3302] And he wants this one who is hanging up on that cross to remember him. The world scoffs at the fear of the Lord. You don't see it very many places you know.
[time=3319] You don't see it too often even in the churches. The world also scoffs at a thought of life after death.
[time=3330] In the last 10 or 15 years we've had a lot of stories about how pleasant it is to die in those strange accounts.
[time=3341] The only record that we have that's reliable is the Bible. And there is life after death.
[time=3353] And now this dying thief has been brought to a full conviction of this great truth. And therefore he cries out, "Lord, help me!"
[time=3366] Had I been on that cross? And had I somehow been made aware of who he was, this one on the center cross, I think I might have said something like this.
[time=3377] Now that I know who you are, that you really are Jehovah the Son, or God the Son. Now that I know who you are and that you are sinless and that you're doing what you're doing, now that I know that, why don't you indeed come off the cross, take me with you, and I promise you, Lord, I will live the rest of my life serving you. Why didn't he say that?
[time=3403] You see, this dying thief has come to the realization of what true blessedness is really all about.
[time=3414] True blessedness is not coming off of a cross, and living in this life, the very best life. That's not it.
[time=3424] True blessedness is to keep company with the Lord Jesus in that life which is yet again.
