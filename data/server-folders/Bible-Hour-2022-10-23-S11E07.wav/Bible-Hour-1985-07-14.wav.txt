[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] And welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=63] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's The Bible Hour.
[time=71] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=80] Join us, won't you, for The Bible Hour.
[time=85] [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=154] - Thank you, please recede it.
[time=156] - What a joy it is this morning to assemble in this place
[time=162] and to sing How Great Thou Art.
[time=165] But it's indeed a double privilege when we have our guests, the cathedral quartet with us today.
[time=170] Their ministry is so encouraging and so refreshing that it's a joy for us to come and to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=179] This past week, I was doing some study on the church and trying to put down what is it that people believe the church to be?
[time=185] One man said, a church is a place with a steeple where people go to get married and to get buried.
[time=192] You know, is that your concept of church?
[time=194] Actually, it's a place, it's the center of God's program for life and new birth, for joy and for celebration.
[time=201] We've come together today to celebrate.
[time=203] You've joined us here.
[time=204] Many guests and friends today and also our friends who join us for the Bible are welcome today.
[time=211] Let's ask the cathedral quartet to come and delete us today by providing the ministry of music, the cathedral quartet from Ohio.
[time=222] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=346] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1247] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1797] I thank you for new life and forgiveness. I thank you for putting a purpose in my heart. I thank you for this body of people and those who today know that Jesus Christ is the Lord of their heart and their life's purpose is to serve him and to glorify him. Father today we pray that that vision and that spirit would be shed abroad in this congregation and by way of television to many hearts that there would be those today that would discover that in Jesus Christ they can have new life.
[time=1827] We thank you for forgiveness. We thank you for songs that challenge us to wait out a little bit deeper. Father our faith is too often shallow. Thank you for the challenge to grow. Father by song and by your word today we do ask you to renew our faith, to refresh our soul, and to make our spirit alive.
[time=1847] We pray today Father that you would strengthen each heart. We thank you for those who and illness today are able to come. We pray for our President today that you would give recovery to his body and wisdom continued to his mind as he governs this land.
[time=1863] We pray today for Tanya that you would give direction to her young heart. We pray for her family that you would strengthen them. We pray for the dables in Mary Lampman and others who have battled cancer and continued sickness that you would restore and refresh.
[time=1880] We pray for John Keel today in an operating room. God we ask you to rebuild each one. And yet Father as we identify these needs we're aware that each heart here today has needs and only you can meet them.
[time=1894] We ask you to restore and to renew each one through your word. For it's in Jesus name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1904] Amen and a rather usual but methodical way open the daily mail there to discover a letter on familiar stationary. His smile turned to a frown and his frown to disgust and finally halfway through the letter he dropped it on the table and he said to his wife.
[time=1921] It's him again. It's always him.
[time=1926] I wish just one time he would call us and ask us our suggestions before he plunges headlong into his ideas. He always goes on these great trips with these great visions and then he writes us when he's in trouble.
[time=1941] Send help. Send money. I've got problems. If I get one more piece of mail like this, well I don't know what I'm going to do. It's him again.
[time=1953] That was the response of two men who we really have never heard of by the name of.
[time=1960] He was very ambiguous and homogenous. He never heard of them. But when the Apostle Paul wrote to them and asked for support and asked for encouragement, asked for a reference, they said, "Oh, it's him again." And they refused.
[time=1977] But there was another man. Man by the name of Ona Sifras. You were probably just thinking about Ona Sifras this past week and the influence he's had in your life.
[time=1989] Not a completely well-known character out of the scriptures, but yet a unique individual. An individual that God has given us a word of commendation.
[time=1999] He's included in the scriptures for our example. Just as we would study a Caleb as a visionary and an Abigail as a peacemaker, this morning we study Ona Sifras, a refresher.
[time=2010] Wouldn't you like to be the type of person who had the ability to take someone who's discouraged and put hope into their life?
[time=2018] Someone who has been bruised and to mend their wounds? Someone who was ready to quit and put in them a new spirit of fervent determination?
[time=2028] Someone who has felt rejected and made them feel accepted? I'd love to be such a person. Wouldn't you? Ona Sifras was.
[time=2038] Second Timothy, chapter 1 and verse 15 for our Bible study this morning. Second Timothy, chapter 1, verse 15, the Apostle Paul writes,
[time=2051] "This thou knowest, that all day who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Philegulus and Hermann Genes.
[time=2062] The Lord give mercy unto the house of Ona Sifras, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain.
[time=2072] But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.
[time=2079] The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day. And in how many ways he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest, very well."
[time=2093] Ona Sifras, this in a closing comment at the end of Second Timothy are the only remarks we have regarding this significant, unique individual who had such an impact on the life of the Apostle Paul
[time=2106] and from the Apostle Paul in history. He was a fresher. Let's just take a moment to set the stage. First of all, Paul is being retained in prison.
[time=2120] The situation has grown very grim. At first, in his first imprisonment, he was under house arrest and he seemed to have some liberty to come and go. But now in this second Roman imprisonment, under the mad Emperor Nero, he is held in a much stricter bondage.
[time=2136] He is no longer being held by the Praetorian or the palace guard, but he is held in a common prison.
[time=2145] Add to that hurt the fact that he was not only being retained in prison, but he was being rejected by his associates.
[time=2157] The people that Paul had loved in life, who he had encouraged, who he had traveled far distance to see, people that he had spent years with, people that he couldn't wait to get back to see, people that he made a detour on his trip to Jerusalem just to spend some time with them.
[time=2175] Now in his time of need, he rejected him. Have you ever been rejected by a friend, a family member, an associate of a long time, a partner, someone who you felt like if I could call on these people, they would help.
[time=2193] And to discover rejection, some of you know that. Some of you know the herd of rejection as you've loved your children and they've only grown up to grow better.
[time=2209] They've broken your heart. They've rejected you. They've rejected your influence.
[time=2216] Some of you know the rejection of parents. Some of you and wisdom have made decisions to honor God.
[time=2224] Your family has not known the Lord. And because of your spiritual commitment, they have rejected you.
[time=2233] Others, if you know the tragic loss, through rejection of a spouse would leave you. Paul was faced with the isolation, the loneliness of a jail to reach out and define rejection.
[time=2255] He said all of those of Asia have turned away. By Asia he means not the Far East but the Roman province of Asia, what we would now call Western Turkey.
[time=2265] The principal city was Ephesus. Paul had spent more time in Ephesus than anywhere else on his missionary journeys. He had poured his heart and his life into them and he reached out to them.
[time=2278] And they turned away. They turned away.
[time=2284] He names three. Two we have mentioned. A fourth is a man by the name of Demas who carries this epitaph with him throughout history.
[time=2293] Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world.
[time=2301] Retained in prison, rejected by friends. It is a dark hour in his life, but he's refreshed.
[time=2311] He's refreshed because one person made a difference. His name? Onus Sifras. How did he do that? What were his activities? How was he a refresher? How can we do that today?
[time=2325] Well as Paul described onus Sifras, he gives to us a three-fold description using verb phrases. He tells us the ministry that this young man had.
[time=2335] Let's look at these phrases in reverse order and they will build to a crescendo.
[time=2340] In verse 17 Paul said these words. He sought me out diligently. Paul was in prison. He was isolated. He was obscure.
[time=2350] And onus Sifras had to literally hunt through the many many many prisons of Rome. That great metropolitan area would have people incarcerated in hundreds of places.
[time=2362] And onus Sifras had to go searching for this man Paul. And he sought him out diligently until he found him. That tells me something.
[time=2375] That tells me that a refresher is a person who takes the initiative.
[time=2385] A refresher is a person who takes the initiative. Here's Paul in prison. Here's Onus Sifras who heard that Paul is in prison.
[time=2395] And what does he do? He takes the initiative to become involved in the minister and to help.
[time=2404] You know the early church was known for its love. And I really sense that there are two things that made these people take the initiative.
[time=2413] They were sensitive to each other. And spontaneous in ministry.
[time=2422] If there's anything that will make a difference in our life, it's when we are sensitive to each other and we are spontaneous to ministry.
[time=2431] I heard a man on the radio say, and I agree with him.
[time=2436] He said, "This friend came to me and said, 'Did you know that so-and-so in our church is having financial difficulty somebody ought to do something to help, pastor?'
[time=2447] Another person said, 'Did you hear about so-and-so they're really struggling in the faith why somebody ought to do something, pastor?'
[time=2455] And he said, 'Day after day people come and they say, 'Here are the needs.' And finally in frustration this pastor said, 'I just started saying to people when they brought the need to me, what have you done to meet that need?'
[time=2469] You know God's plan for the ministry was not the development of programs, but the development of people.
[time=2479] I'm excited about programs and I'm not meaning to put down programs. We got more programs here than I even know about.
[time=2487] And I'm thankful for every one of them. But the primary ministry is not programs, it's people.
[time=2493] I am thankful that Ona Sifras didn't say, 'Why, that Paul's in jail. You know what we need to do? We need to get a board of directors together and start a worldwide ministry to prisoners.'
[time=2505] Paul would have died before they ever got the organizational chart drawn up.
[time=2511] Ona Sifras took the initiative because he was sensitive to Paul and he was spontaneous in ministry.
[time=2522] That's what made the difference. I read in a political article a statement that said this,
[time=2530] 'The liberals want to help people, but they don't know how. The conservatives know how and don't care.'
[time=2544] Boy, that was convicting. How true that is, tragically true.
[time=2551] Here was a man who cared and who took the initiative. But you know if you take the initiative, it's going to require effort.
[time=2560] Initiative requires taking effort. Notice how did he search for him? He sought for him diligently, so diligently, he stayed at it until he found him.
[time=2572] You know most of us, in our efforts to reach out to people, aren't quite that way. We're rather token.
[time=2582] A good question is to ask this, 'How much or how little does it take to stop me from following through to help someone else?'
[time=2597] You know it, if you're honest in your own heart, somebody needs a phone call. They need a word of encouragement. They need to hear from you.
[time=2604] They need for you to offer to do some very specific things. And so you call them, and almost with glee and excitement, nobody answers the phone.
[time=2613] Then next Sunday you can say, 'Oh, Mildred, I called you this week. I'm sorry I missed you. The guilt is gone.'
[time=2624] You know, Ona Sifras didn't write a letter and say, 'Paul, I looked for you, but I couldn't find you. God bless. I'll be praying for you.'
[time=2633] Taking initiative requires continued effort. And he went, and he went, and he went until he found, until he found.
[time=2646] A person who was a refresher is someone who was willing to take the initiative. Now Paul describes a second thing he did.
[time=2656] He not only took the initiative, but he did this. He said, 'He was not ashamed of my chains.'
[time=2666] What did he mean by that? He was not ashamed of my change.
[time=2670] Paul was saying, 'Ona Sifras, unlike everyone else, he accepted me right where I was, just as I was. Chains and all.'
[time=2680] For you to see, to accept Paul, and to go visit Paul, was to put your life under suspect. It was to identify with him and go in that prison.
[time=2689] And someone would say, 'Well, if we're holding Paul for being a Christian legal elicitor, then we ought to hold this ona Sifras prisoner.'
[time=2697] And it would very well jeopardize his own life. And so there were those who would see Paul's situation, and they would be ashamed.
[time=2705] They would look at him, and they would say a prisoner, a reproach, an outcast. We're embarrassed by his behavior.
[time=2713] We're appalled at his situation, and we don't want to identify with that. But ona Sifras was not ashamed.
[time=2723] A refresher is someone who accepts people. Let's be honest, beloved. How comfortable are we around people who aren't successful?
[time=2737] I mean, how comfortable are we around someone who's teenagers on drugs? You find yourself gravitating towards those people,
[time=2747] or do you find yourself kind of repelled, wanting to close off? How comfortable are you around someone when they mention they've been divorced?
[time=2759] Or their spouses left them? How comfortable are you around someone who is chronically unemployed or underemployed?
[time=2771] How comfortable are you around someone whose kids are so bad you're thinking about calling the dog warden?
[time=2781] Are you embarrassed to be with them? We're really not too comfortable, are we?
[time=2788] We're really not too accepting. Well, we're glad to see him here because there's an unwritten rule in the Bible that says everyone, when coming to church shall wear a mask.
[time=2802] And we're all going to pretend that it's all all right. And I know that you know that it's not all right, but I'm not going to let you know that I know that it's all right.
[time=2811] And that way we can say everything's fine. And we can come and we can step out into the water and we can go home and say, "Shh, got by again." They didn't get to me.
[time=2822] You know, churches can be tough places. One pastor said, "I love my church. I just wish that when I said amen after the morning message, a hole opened up and swallowed me down so they couldn't get to me afterwards."
[time=2835] Some of you've learned the fast way out of the church so nobody can get to you.
[time=2840] We're really not very accepting of one another.
[time=2844] Someone said, "Most caring and sharing that goes on in a Christian church is like an office party Christmas gift exchange.
[time=2854] It's the haves exchanging with the haves, purposely leaving out the have-nots and making sure that what I get is equal to what I give.
[time=2864] Nobody lose. Nobody gains. Everybody walks away at comfortable winter."
[time=2872] Here was Ona Sifras who looked at a man in chains and he said, "I will accept him. I will go to him."
[time=2879] He was gravitating towards the need when everyone else was being repelled.
[time=2885] When everyone else was closing the doors, he was opening them.
[time=2891] He was accepting of people.
[time=2895] But you know accepting people requires vulnerability.
[time=2901] That's what those chains were.
[time=2903] When Ona Sifras go, and maybe a Roman soldier would retain him.
[time=2909] Maybe he, under the madman Nero, would be placed in the dungeons below the Colosseum simply to be fed to lions as a crowd would gather to see how fast he could run.
[time=2920] To stay home, to return to Asia would be safe. It would be comfortable.
[time=2929] After all, he was a family man, you know. He just can't be sticking his head out on the front line.
[time=2934] Why, his first priority is his family.
[time=2938] You say, "Hocks, that's conjecture." No, it's not.
[time=2941] Paul prayed that the household, the family of Ona Sifras would find mercy.
[time=2949] This man risked his life. He became vulnerable.
[time=2955] You know, to refresh people requires that we become vulnerable.
[time=2960] It's going to cost us some time, and our schedule is going to be made vulnerable.
[time=2965] You know, it's amazing that if you want to take vacation in your organization, you've got to give them several weeks' notice.
[time=2972] If you're going to quit, they'd like at least a month's notice.
[time=2975] But some people have the audacity to die without any notice given in advance.
[time=2982] They just do that.
[time=2986] You know, if you're going to be involved with people, they're going to die without a schedule.
[time=2992] I wish teenagers would tell their parents, "Listen, mom and dad, about three Friday nights from now, I'm going to go out experimenting in the car with drugs." So, you know, just have all your support ready for next Friday.
[time=3006] You know, the needs of people never happen on a calendar.
[time=3010] They never happen on a calendar.
[time=3012] If we're going to be available to refresh people, we're going to have to be vulnerable in the area of time.
[time=3020] We're going to have to be vulnerable in the area of financial resources.
[time=3026] You know, it costs on usifras some time to get from Asia to Rome.
[time=3033] It costs them some money.
[time=3037] People's needs are consuming.
[time=3042] How tight a grip do you have on that checkbook?
[time=3046] Most of all, I found that it causes us vulnerability in our emotions.
[time=3052] Let's face it, we're all finite.
[time=3055] We must have an infinite ability to care.
[time=3058] None of us have an infinite ability to bear everybody's burdens.
[time=3063] And there are a lot of times that you go to minister to someone and you come away and your cup's empty.
[time=3070] I'm going to make a confession. I don't do a great deal of counseling.
[time=3073] But after two or three counseling sessions a day, my cup is empty.
[time=3077] I really feel sometimes when people come, the best thing I could do is say, if it's a dime, you better call someone else.
[time=3085] It can be draining, can it? Some of you know that.
[time=3088] A family member is leaned on you and they're zapping you of your emotional strength.
[time=3094] It's vulnerable to care and to endeavor to refresh.
[time=3101] But onusifras did that. He took the initiative and that required effort.
[time=3106] He was accepting and that required vulnerability.
[time=3111] And as a result of that, Paul said, he sought me out, he was not ashamed, and he refreshed me.
[time=3120] But the word refresh means in the Greek, it's exactly what it means in English to refresh, to restore, to renew.
[time=3128] It's actually used after a race to cool someone off.
[time=3133] If you ever have been out on one of these hot, humid summer days, it hasn't rained in months.
[time=3142] The ground is dry, but the air is humid and you're cutting the grass.
[time=3147] The mower blows the little particles of grass and dust out and the wind blows it back right on your body and it sticks.
[time=3156] And you're counting how many more swipes with the mowers are going to take before this all ends.
[time=3163] And out comes your dear wife with this giant tumbler of iced tea filled to the top with ice cubes bobbing as she walks.
[time=3176] Let's go home.
[time=3179] And you sit and boy is that refreshing. What a difference it makes.
[time=3184] Someone puts a new taste in your mouth.
[time=3188] That's what Onus Sifras did to Paul. He put a new taste in his mouth.
[time=3194] The word is onus cecis.
[time=3197] Two Greek words on which simply means against cecis is a form of the word that means psyche or soul.
[time=3203] It simply means as Onus Sifras came and he put a new soul, a new spirit in the heart of the Apostle Paul.
[time=3210] How did he do that? Can I give you three things that he did or didn't do that refreshed Paul?
[time=3217] The first thing is this. He did not change Paul's circumstances.
[time=3223] Onus Sifras didn't come in and say listen Paul, just relax. Me and this one other guy, we each have got a dagger.
[time=3229] And the two of us were going to attack this Roman Legion and we're going to get you out of this mess.
[time=3236] Onus Sifras had absolutely no ability to change Paul's situation.
[time=3242] Why do I make that point? Because most of the time you and I look at someone's situation and we recognize immediately we can't change that.
[time=3250] And so in our own feelings of inadequacy we retreat because we don't think we can make any difference.
[time=3258] And so we retreat. Onus Sifras did nothing to change Paul's situations but secondly he visited him.
[time=3268] He came in and he sat with him and he listened. He talked, no doubt they prayed together.
[time=3275] I'm sure that they sang together. Paul loved to sing in prison. Read that in the book of Acts in Philippians.
[time=3280] They're singing away in prison. Onus Sifras came and gave somebody to sing the second part harmony with him.
[time=3286] Step into the water, wait out a little bit deeper. He'd sing. He would pray. He would cry. He would share burdens.
[time=3298] He would visit. You know that you've got friends around you who are dying for you.
[time=3306] You can't change their circumstance. You can't make their teenage kid do the right thing.
[time=3312] You can't do that. You're trying but you can't do that. You can't make their husband love them.
[time=3318] You can't make their wife return. You can't give them a job.
[time=3325] So you've retreated when you could come. What could you do? You could talk. You could listen.
[time=3333] You could sing. You could pray. You could tell him the latest funny story. You heard just to give him a breath of air away from it all.
[time=3341] But you're being there would make all the difference. Onus Sifras was there.
[time=3347] Third thing he did was this. He not only visited, but thirdly, he visited often. Verse 16.
[time=3357] "The house give mercy to the house of Onus Sifras, for he often refreshed me."
[time=3366] He didn't go and make a token visit and cross it off of his to-do list so that any time anybody mentioned Paul,
[time=3372] he'd say, "Yeah, Paul, I was there the other day to see him." Not admitting that the other day was the other week of the other month.
[time=3380] But he was there again and again and again. To do what? To change the circumstances? No, simply to cool them off and to refresh them.
[time=3396] Can I give you this little formula? Initiative plus acceptance produces refreshment.
[time=3406] You know, there was a time when someone took the initiative to love you and to love me.
[time=3413] Someone didn't stop until it cost him his life to take the initiative to reach you and to reach me and he accepted us.
[time=3425] This one who took the initiative, he accepted us with our bitterness and our envy and our strife and our jealousy and our greed and our petty wants and our sexual dysfunctions.
[time=3435] He took us with our shortcomings, our hang-ups, our excess, and he said, "I accept you just as you are."
[time=3442] And he took the initiative to hang on a cross and to die for our sins. And you know Jesus' initiative to accept us.
[time=3448] His death on our behalf allows us to have new life and a new birth.
[time=3453] Have you accepted him? If not today, I pray that you will.
[time=3465] Again, I want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
