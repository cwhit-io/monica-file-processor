[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=34] Now, live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=42] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message
[time=53] from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=57] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=61] For more information on the Bible Hour, visit our website at www.thebiblehour.com.
[time=66] With God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks. Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=73] (music playing)
[time=96] Now sing together that fourth stanza, "When Christ Shall Come," looking forward to His
[time=107] glorious return.
[time=109] (music playing)
[time=132] Sing, my soul, my Savior God to thee, our great God, our great Lord.
[time=157] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=166] Again, we welcome you to our morning service today.
[time=170] We especially welcome those that are watching by way of television.
[time=174] We trust that today's service will be a blessing to you.
[time=177] Our Pastor Rick Hawks is away from us today.
[time=180] He's speaking at the Chapel and University Park in Akron, Ohio.
[time=184] This is Rick's home church, a place where he found the Lord and where he grew in the Lord and then eventually was called to be a minister of the gospel.
[time=192] We're delighted that Kathy and Rick have the opportunity to go back home and to minister in that church.
[time=197] Kathy will be singing this morning and Rick will be giving the message.
[time=200] We're glad that they have this time away and the opportunity to worship there in their home church.
[time=205] We're going to listen now to the choirs they sing a great hymn, a great anthem that says, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord."
[time=240] Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.
[time=266] And of people who he has chosen, chosen for his inheritance, the son is the nation whose
[time=288] God is the Lord, whose God is the Lord.
[time=303] Only my voice and I will be a God, and you shall be like before.
[time=319] I will give you one more, and one more, and one more, and one more, and one more, and
[time=379] one more, and one more, and one more, and one more, and one more, and one more, and one
[time=1405] he has promised to be spiritually present wherever people gather in his name.
[time=1412] I guess that's what makes a church service different than the PTA, or any other kind
[time=1421] of social club or group.
[time=1424] We have met together in the name of Christ, and therefore he himself is with us.
[time=1435] And I'm glad for that.
[time=1437] I'm also glad to be here because the Black Hawk Baptist Church is a church that has come
[time=1443] on the scene in the last 17 or so years, and has become known as a church of real growth
[time=1453] and vision development.
[time=1458] You cannot put on a worship service such as we have today with such a choir, with such
[time=1466] special music, televised in the area, with a Christian school, various kinds of ministries,
[time=1477] a marvelous physical plan such as you have here and full-time staff.
[time=1483] A church cannot do those things unless it is filled with people who are serious about
[time=1491] the things of Christ.
[time=1495] People have to take very seriously the work of the Lord.
[time=1501] They have to be here.
[time=1503] They have to give their money.
[time=1505] They have to be the kind of people who are serious about living for the Lord.
[time=1511] You just do not have churches like this with this kind of a program without people who
[time=1520] are committed in a serious way.
[time=1525] And because that is true, I have decided this morning to bring to you a thought from scripture
[time=1533] which I am entitled, "Let's get serious.
[time=1540] Let's get serious about our Christian life."
[time=1547] Now you may say to me, "Well, we don't need a message like that.
[time=1551] We are already serious.
[time=1553] You just told us that.
[time=1556] We sang and we had programs and we had organization and we are serious.
[time=1562] Why talk about being serious when you just said we are?" Well, not in any way to scold you and not in any way to contradict what I've already
[time=1573] said, but I have come rather to encourage you and to say to you, "Yes, you are a serious
[time=1582] group of people.
[time=1584] You are doing a marvelous work for the Lord.
[time=1586] Now hang in there.
[time=1589] Do not flag.
[time=1592] Do not feel despair.
[time=1593] Do not weary and say, "Oh, we have been working so hard for the Lord for these number of years
[time=1599] and we are doing all of these things.
[time=1602] Are we really doing the right thing?" It is the thought of the New Testament and of the apostle Peter in particular that every
[time=1612] one of us has the children of God.
[time=1614] If we are really saved, if we really know Christ in a personal way, if we call upon our Creator
[time=1621] as Father, it is our responsibility to take our Christian life very seriously.
[time=1635] So let's get serious.
[time=1638] I invite you to meet me at 1 Peter, chapter 1, verses 17 through 21.
[time=1647] First Peter 1, verses 17 through 21.
[time=1660] In this section you will notice 5 verses, but really one long sentence.
[time=1669] Peter likes to write in long sentences and then he packs them with all kinds of important
[time=1676] but extra detail.
[time=1678] This morning I am going to read these 5 verses to you from 1 Peter and I want you to be looking
[time=1685] for the one main thing that he says.
[time=1690] He is challenging them and us through them.
[time=1694] He is challenging them to be serious about the things of Christ.
[time=1698] Before I read them I should also say this.
[time=1702] Peter begins his book by reminding them of their privileged position.
[time=1709] He says essentially we are privileged characters, if you will notice beginning at verse 3 he
[time=1715] uses the word blessed be the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who has done this and he has done that and he has done some other things.
[time=1723] We are privileged characters as Christians.
[time=1727] He continues in that vein through verse 12, but when you come to verse 13 he flips the
[time=1733] coin of privilege and on the other side is marked responsibility.
[time=1739] Whenever the children come and say can I have the car dead, you will say yes you may have the car, that is the privilege, but do put some gasoline in the tank, that is the responsibility.
[time=1754] So it is in the Christian life, we have privileges verses 3 through 12 and they are followed
[time=1761] hard with some very real responsibilities.
[time=1766] Now this morning I am chosen just one responsibility that Peter lays upon me and that one responsibility
[time=1776] is found in verses 17 through 21, will you follow along as I read.
[time=1785] And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons, judges according to every
[time=1792] man's work, pass the time of your so-journey here in fear.
[time=1798] For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the
[time=1809] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained
[time=1817] before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by
[time=1824] him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory, that your
[time=1830] faith and hope might be in God.
[time=1833] Now I mentioned to you that this was a long sentence, it covers five verses, but I presume
[time=1840] at the end of verse 17 that you discovered the main gist of what Peter was trying to say.
[time=1849] The imperative or the command or the responsibility that he gives to us in these words, pass the
[time=1859] time of your so-journey here in fear, pass the time of your so-journey here in fear.
[time=1872] There are at least two terms there which I must explain.
[time=1876] The first is the word so-journey, pass the time of your so-journey here.
[time=1884] We hear our modern English word journey in the last part of the word.
[time=1892] To so-journey meant to take a journey, to take a trip.
[time=1900] A so-journey was a temporary resident, a renter.
[time=1910] My family and I are just returning from a vacation out west.
[time=1915] Your music director Pete mentioned that he had been out in California and he had been in Oregon.
[time=1920] I presume we must have chased each other around those two states because we were out there as well.
[time=1926] We had car trouble and were delayed for three or four days.
[time=1930] I should have found him and he could have brought me back to Fort Wayne, I guess, with
[time=1936] him.
[time=1937] We tented, we had what we have, our family tent and we went from KOA to KOA and we tented.
[time=1948] And each night we would drive the stakes down in and then the morning pull the stakes back up.
[time=1953] And we were only temporary residents in Missouri and Oklahoma and Arizona and California, Oregon
[time=1961] and so on.
[time=1964] We didn't own any property there.
[time=1965] We didn't have any voting privileges there.
[time=1968] We were just kind of passing through.
[time=1972] When Peter says, "Pass the time of your so-journey here in fear," he is reminding us that as
[time=1980] the people who belong to God, we are only here on earth for a little while.
[time=1986] We are just passing through.
[time=1990] The songwriter nailed it when he said, "This world is not my home, I am just passing through."
[time=1999] My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[time=2003] The angels back in me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore.
[time=2012] We are temporary residents here.
[time=2016] We are so journers.
[time=2018] It refers to that time in our life from the point of salvation when we accept Christ as
[time=2027] Savior when we become a member of the family of God, from that point on to the rapture
[time=2035] or death, whichever might come first.
[time=2039] This is our earthly sojourn.
[time=2044] This is the time of our temporary residence here.
[time=2050] Peter says, "Pass the time of your life here as a believer in fear."
[time=2061] That's the second term that I must explain for a few moments.
[time=2066] The term fear.
[time=2067] What does he mean, "spend your life in fear"?
[time=2072] Well he is not talking about being afraid of God and quaking and shaking and quivering
[time=2079] less somehow.
[time=2081] He strikes us down.
[time=2082] It is not that kind of a fear because the scriptures teach us we have a friendly relationship
[time=2089] with God.
[time=2090] We are His children.
[time=2091] He is our Father, not a fearful relationship with Him.
[time=2095] His perfect love casts out fear, that kind of fear.
[time=2101] He is not talking about living in terror every day.
[time=2107] Nor is he talking here about being so sober or so serious that as a believer, the time
[time=2117] we have left on earth, we never laugh, and somehow believers must get rid of any kind
[time=2124] of a sense of humor and never tell or respond to a joke that we are just very, very serious
[time=2131] sober kinds of people.
[time=2136] Fear here is the sense of a desire not to waste your life.
[time=2149] A fear lest we look back on our sojourn on these few brief years and they are brief
[time=2156] and the longer you live, the quicker they go.
[time=2160] A fear lest we waste them, lest we look back with regret and say, "Oh, I wish I would
[time=2167] have.
[time=2168] Oh, why didn't I?" Lest we look back and say, "I just frittered away my life and the opportunities that the Lord gave me to serve Him.
[time=2179] I missed those opportunities." It also has the notion, "I think, a fear lest we bring disgrace on the name of the Lord.
[time=2192] Lest by our living or by our attitudes or by something we do or do not do, we fail as
[time=2199] believers and thus bring shame and drag down the name of the Lord."
[time=2207] Now I am going to summarize all of that into one sentence.
[time=2213] What Peter says, "I must do and you must do as the children of God is simply this.
[time=2219] Take your life seriously.
[time=2223] Get serious about your Christianity.
[time=2227] We really don't have time to waste.
[time=2231] We really do not have opportunity or time to dabble with sin, to toy with sin, to get
[time=2238] ourselves involved and entangled in any kind of sin past the time that God gives you."
[time=2248] And none of us knows how long that time is going to be.
[time=2251] But however long your sojourn on this life is, don't waste it.
[time=2260] Be deadly serious about your Christianity.
[time=2268] Now you folks have, at least from an external viewpoint, done that.
[time=2274] Your church service, your church reputation, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2280] You are doing that.
[time=2282] And I am saying to you, keep doing it.
[time=2285] And I am saying to individual believers who may be lagging behind, who may be trying to
[time=2291] live as close to the world and not really with it spiritually, I say to you in the name of
[time=2298] the Lord Jesus Christ and with the words of the Apostle Peter, don't waste your life.
[time=2306] Don't have to look back with regret and say, "Oh, I wish I would have passed the time of
[time=2312] your sojourn here on earth in fear."
[time=2319] Now Peter is going to convince us as to why we ought to do that.
[time=2326] He's going to say, "I've got some good reason why you should be serious as a Christian."
[time=2334] And that's what these five verses are all about.
[time=2338] The words clustering around verse 17 through 21, those words give us the reason.
[time=2345] They answer the question, "Why should I be a serious believer?"
[time=2351] And I think that's a pretty good question.
[time=2355] Why should I get serious?
[time=2358] Notice the why that Peter gives, verse 17 again.
[time=2362] And if you call on the Father, "Who without respect of persons judges according to every
[time=2369] man's work, pass the time of your sojourn here in fear."
[time=2377] If you call yourself a Christian, if you say, "God is my Father."
[time=2386] If you pray before you eat your meal or before you read your Bible and you bow your head
[time=2393] and you say, "Our Father, Heavenly Father."
[time=2400] That's a profession of being related to God, of being a believer in Christ.
[time=2406] He says, "If you make that profession, then you better realize that there is an accounting
[time=2414] to be made to him down the road."
[time=2420] This one whom we call the Father is one who will judge.
[time=2427] Did you notice that word in the verse?
[time=2430] He will judge impartially the work of each one.
[time=2436] Now if I know that my Heavenly Father is going to scrutinize my life, if I know he's
[time=2445] going to take it apart piece by piece and examine every phase of my life as a Christian,
[time=2453] we call it the judgment seat of Christ in other passages.
[time=2459] If I know I must stand before him, how then should I be living today?
[time=2469] There is an accounting to be made therefore past the time of your sojourn here in fear.
[time=2484] Now someone may say, "Well, I know there's an accounting out there, but you don't know
[time=2492] who I am, you don't know my social status, you don't know the reputation and the influence
[time=2502] that I am around this church." And somehow I think that my name or my money or my influence will somehow slip me through
[time=2515] that inspection station up there, but notice the verse again, "The Father without respect
[time=2527] of persons judges." That's an impartial judgment.
[time=2535] In that day it will not matter how much money I have, what my name is, how well known or
[time=2541] unknown we are, how much influence we have, all of those external things will be stripped
[time=2547] away, and the Lord will judge, he will discern, he will scrutinize.
[time=2555] What did you do with your earthly pilgrimage?
[time=2563] Someone else may say, "Well, I can blame it on somebody else.
[time=2570] After all, the Lord understands what I've had to live with or what I've gone through with other people at the church." But notice again the wording of the verse, "Not only does he judge impartially, but he
[time=2584] also judges individually according to every man's work."
[time=2594] You will not be able to say, "My husband made me do this.
[time=2600] If you had to live with the children I had to live with, you would have ended up with the same kind of life." No.
[time=2607] There will be an individual, impartial judgment on what I did with my earthly life.
[time=2622] Therefore, past the time in fear.
[time=2633] Now you don't know much about me, and you don't need to know much about me.
[time=2638] You've been told I teach Bible at Cedarville College, and that's true.
[time=2642] In my New Testament survey class, I have them write some papers.
[time=2648] Don't feel sorry for them, but rather for me, I have to read them.
[time=2655] Over the years, I have discovered that students don't always spell everything just right, and the grammar is not always right, and so I came up with this little arrangement.
[time=2666] In your paper, I will allow you ten mistakes.
[time=2672] But after ten, the paper's coming back, and you're going to have to re-type it, or else
[time=2678] you'll flunk it.
[time=2682] I was amazed at how the quality of the papers changed, how the students took a little more
[time=2688] time to check the spelling and correct the grammar, maybe even re-type a whole page,
[time=2694] because if there's anything students don't like more than writing a paper, it's rewriting
[time=2700] the same paper.
[time=2703] The quality went up, because they knew there was an accounting to be made for their mistakes.
[time=2710] My beloved friends, if we know that there is an accounting to be made in front of our
[time=2720] heavenly Father, the quality of our living must go up.
[time=2730] We cannot dabble with sin, and we dare not waste this precious time of living as a believer.
[time=2742] We don't have time to waste.
[time=2745] There's an accounting to be made.
[time=2747] Now, that's not his only reason, that's just his beginning one.
[time=2752] That's the second reason he gives in verse 18, for as much as you know, that you were
[time=2761] not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received
[time=2768] by tradition from your fathers, but you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ
[time=2774] as of a lamb without blemish and without spa.
[time=2780] Peter refers to the price, the great price that was paid for our salvation.
[time=2792] You were redeemed, he says, not with mere money, not gold, silver, dollar bills, earthly
[time=2800] monetary things which perish and lose their value, you were redeemed with blood.
[time=2811] He calls it, you will notice, precious blood.
[time=2815] I have a notion that whenever we read that word, precious, we ought to pause.
[time=2822] We ought to let the value of that word and of that blood sink in.
[time=2832] It was precious blood.
[time=2837] I should like to call it, we were redeemed with the precious blood of the perfect person.
[time=2848] He was a lamb without blemish and without spa.
[time=2855] He of course is referring to the Lord Jesus, isn't he?
[time=2859] He is referring to the cross.
[time=2861] He is referring to the nails and to the crown of thorns and to the spear and all of the physical
[time=2867] agonies of that cross he says to me, "Do not waste your life."
[time=2876] I bought it and I didn't just buy it with a dollar out of my pocket or a million dollars
[time=2883] out of my bank.
[time=2885] I bought it with my blood that's costly, that's precious, and you don't waste something
[time=2894] like that, now think with me.
[time=2900] Many times when we talk about being saved, we talk about being saved from, we were saved
[time=2908] from sin, that's true, we're saved from hell, that's true, we're saved from Satan, yes.
[time=2916] And sometimes we talk about being saved too, we're saved to heaven, we're saved for the
[time=2923] Lord and we look to the future and say we're saved for that down there and we've been saved from this in the past, what about right now?
[time=2932] This passage is talking about right now, the Lord Jesus Christ did not save you, he did
[time=2940] not shed his blood just for the past or just for the future.
[time=2946] He saved you and he saved me for now, the time of our sojourning here, you say how do you
[time=2956] know that?
[time=2957] Well look back with me just a moment.
[time=2960] Verse 18 right at the end he says we were saved from a vain conversation received by tradition
[time=2967] from our fathers, but we were saved with the precious blood of Christ.
[time=2972] You see before we are saved, we are living like everybody else, we don't know anything different, we've received it from our parents, we've received it from our friends, just kind of a way of life, but when you are saved by the blood of Christ, he gives you a new life,
[time=2990] he gives you a fresh start, from the point of salvation onto the rapture or death, that's
[time=2997] the time of my sojourning as a believer in Christ.
[time=3001] He says don't waste it, don't fritter it away, why?
[time=3006] There's an accounting to be made, yes there has been a great price, pain, don't waste it.
[time=3018] You try to keep your children in nice clothes, our kids like certain kinds of jeans or Levi's,
[time=3027] George's, whatever, so you buy those or try to, you give an arm and a leg for them, you
[time=3036] walk by the bedroom door that happens to be open and the room is empty, and there you see those expensive jeans laid out on the carpet like the rapture had come, chew, they're
[time=3047] on.
[time=3048] And sooner or later you say to your child, hey you don't treat your clothes like that,
[time=3057] why not?
[time=3058] Because we paid an arm and a leg, those things are costly, you take care of them.
[time=3064] Same it is, same kind of reasoning Peter has, you don't waste your Christian experience,
[time=3074] why not?
[time=3075] It costs too much, the precious blood of Christ.
[time=3084] Now the sentence is not done, we're halfway through the sentence, but we're not quite to the end.
[time=3090] And Peter didn't just add these extra words just to fill in space because he didn't know what else to say or how to quit.
[time=3097] There is another reason buried in those last two verses at the end of this long sentence.
[time=3106] For the sake of clarity and that the risk of repetition, he says, take your Christian
[time=3113] life seriously, don't waste it, why not Peter?
[time=3117] You have an accounting to be made down the road, that's future.
[time=3122] And there's been a great price paid at the cross.
[time=3127] Now he's going to take us even farther back than the cross, notice verses 20 and 21.
[time=3135] In describing Christ he says, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
[time=3142] world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God, that
[time=3150] raised him up from the dead and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.
[time=3156] Now don't let those words foreordain before the foundation of the world, don't let those
[time=3164] words scare you.
[time=3167] They simply mean what they sound like.
[time=3171] The Lord Jesus Christ was predetermined.
[time=3176] It was planned by God way back when, way back before our time, way back before the cross
[time=3184] of the Texas, way back before the foundation of the world, imagine that.
[time=3191] Genesis 1, 1, way back in eternity past, God was planning.
[time=3200] God was thinking ahead.
[time=3204] He had his son in mind.
[time=3206] The Lord Jesus Christ was predetermined that he would die for our sin, but God also had in mind this earthly sojourn.
[time=3217] This period of time when I would be saved, when I would live my life and walk with Christ,
[time=3225] Peter says, don't waste that time.
[time=3230] God thought enough of that time.
[time=3232] God thought enough of your Christian experience to plan for it from eternity past, therefore
[time=3238] don't waste it.
[time=3243] Because of the plan that was laid, the plan that was laid.
[time=3251] You know, you may say to me, well that doesn't really grab me, I don't see why God's plan
[time=3257] should motivate me to live, but just think.
[time=3264] If you're really serious about something, you plan for it.
[time=3270] I referred to our vacation, we have been thinking and planning and we could have done a little better job on some things, but we've been thinking and planning on for this vacation seriously since January, maybe even a little earlier than that.
[time=3285] Trying to make some plans and fit our schedule together and get loose and so on and be at the right place at the right time, six months or so.
[time=3296] If you have been involved in a wedding or will be recently and not too distant future,
[time=3303] you know how important planning is.
[time=3306] For that one hour ceremony or so, a good year of planning, let's get all the details
[time=3313] down and make sure you know that everybody knows where they're going to be and the flowers and the colors and all of these kinds of things, planning, why do we plan?
[time=3326] Because it's so important to us.
[time=3329] We want everything to be just so.
[time=3333] We are serious about it and the more serious we are, the longer and the more detailed the
[time=3339] plan, right?
[time=3343] God is very serious about our Christian life.
[time=3349] He's been planning not for six months, not for a year.
[time=3353] He has been planning from before the foundation of the world.
[time=3360] That's serious.
[time=3363] And if God is so serious about my Christian experience, so serious as to plan that much
[time=3370] in advance, then who am I to take it so lightly?
[time=3378] Who am I to say, oh, it really doesn't matter, it's not all that important, I'll get serious about it.
[time=3383] That's what I feel like it, no, no.
[time=3389] Past the time of your so journey in here, in fear, why?
[time=3399] There is an accounting to be made.
[time=3402] There has been a great price pay and there has been a serious plan laying.
[time=3411] Let us get serious about our Christianity.
[time=3418] Some of you, the only way you can get truly serious is to first be saved.
[time=3424] You've been wondering, you've been thinking, you've been perhaps on the verge of becoming
[time=3430] a believer.
[time=3431] I assure you, the only way you can become serious in the things of the Lord is first to
[time=3438] be saved.
[time=3445] Thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour today.

[time=3467] Will you pray with me?
[time=3469] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse
[time=3479] me of my sin and to forgive me.
[time=3481] Jesus, I ask You to come in today, in Your name I pray, amen.
