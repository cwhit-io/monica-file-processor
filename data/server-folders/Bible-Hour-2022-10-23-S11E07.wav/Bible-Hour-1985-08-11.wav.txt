[time=60] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=68] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=74] it's the Bible Hour.
[time=76] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=85] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=89] [singing] Let us sing the fourth answer together.
[time=95] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=153] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=155] Let me give you a special welcome again.
[time=160] We're glad that you've come into the house of the Lord to worship with us today.
[time=164] If you're a regular and you've been on vacation, welcome back.
[time=167] If you're a guest in our midst, we trust that you'll just feel right at home, that you'll join with us as we sing and pray and listen to God's words spoken.
[time=175] We welcome to our television audience by way of the Bible hour.
[time=179] We saw many of them at our Grand Wayne celebration last Sunday, and it was good to know that there are people that are watching, many shut-ins that cannot come to church on Sunday morning make our church service their home church service, and we're just glad that they are involved with us as we worship together.
[time=196] Let's listen to the choir now as they sing a song entitled, "Jesus is My Lord, My Master, and My Savior."
[time=205] [MUSIC - 363 seconds]
[time=578] Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=580] We appreciate it when you join in with us.
[time=582] Let's listen to the ministry now of Denise Mitchell.
[time=585] And she sings a song entitled "Safe in the Harbor." [MUSIC] Long ago, someone asked me, did I know you [MUSIC] I told them that I did, but I was wrong [MUSIC] I even said, I loved you, Lord, but never showed you [MUSIC] Now I regret how far apart we've grown [MUSIC] Until I'm safe in the harbor, Lord [MUSIC] Don't give up on me [MUSIC] 'Cause I'm counting on you [MUSIC] To lead me through stormy weather [MUSIC] 'Til I'm safe in the harbor, Lord [MUSIC] Don't let the tide pull me under [MUSIC] You see, my life is at stake [MUSIC] And I'm trying to find my way [MUSIC] Back home [MUSIC]
[time=689] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=849] This is the point in our program when we break away from our regular service and talk to you.
[time=853] Our pastor Rick Hawks has gone this morning, he's in Colorado speaking to a youth conference.
[time=858] We're glad that he's had the opportunity to do this and we look forward to him coming back next week.
[time=864] Just last night I had the opportunity to go to my 25th reunion of my high school class.
[time=870] It was an exciting time to reminisce.
[time=872] But right now we are getting ready for our new school year at the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=878] My guest today is Mr. Steve Longbrake, who is the principal of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=882] Good morning, Steve.
[time=884] I know that the kids have not been around for the last few weeks and it's been a little bit quiet around here, but since my office is right across from yours, I know that there's been a lot of activity.
[time=893] What are some of the responsibilities that you have in the summertime and then how is enrollment for the fall?
[time=899] People think that all I do is golf and fish in the summer, but I do some other things here at school as well.
[time=904] There are many people who come that are interested in our school and I spend time talking with them.
[time=909] Also, I interview all of the new families at Black Hawk Christian School each summer and learn from them something about them, why they've come, try to discern whether they should really be long in our school.
[time=920] Most of them do.
[time=921] I'm thankful for the people who want Christian education.
[time=924] Also, we have a lot of ordering to do.
[time=926] Many textbooks and materials and we spend a lot of time putting that together.
[time=930] I see a lot of the families come through and it looks like they're some awfully good-looking children, especially the young ones that are coming for the first time.
[time=937] They look very excited about coming to school.
[time=940] How is the enrollment now for fall? Is it looking good?
[time=943] Enrollment is up. We have a few over 280 students right now.
[time=947] That's the most we've had at this time of the summer and we're encouraged by that.
[time=951] We're looking forward to more of the young people coming and I just trust that even through our discussion today,
[time=957] there will be people that will be interested in Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=960] Is there still time to enroll their children in school for this fall?
[time=964] There sure is. Right now, we have a waiting list and kindergarten only.
[time=968] Other classes have openings and if people are interested in Black Hawk Christian School, we'd encourage you to call the school office at 749-8524.
[time=977] We'll be glad to send you information or you could write to us in 7321, East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=986] We'll be really glad to give you any information that you need.
[time=989] Thank you, Steve, and I know that my children are excited about fall.
[time=992] Already Andy's talking about getting school supplies and anticipating his fifth year at the school
[time=999] and Peter in his junior year and we're excited that they're at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1003] Let me encourage any of you that are considering Christian education, that you can get a quality program here and we're grateful for not only Steve Longbreak, but the many teachers that have dedicated their lives to teaching at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1016] We encourage you to inquire about enrollment today.
[time=1019] I'd like to take a moment now and just tell you about a booklet entitled "Hope." And there are many times in our world when it's very difficult to cope with the things that life throws at you.
[time=1029] But Chuck Swindall and his booklet has encouraged us there.
[time=1033] There is an anchor for the soul and that's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1036] May I encourage you to write today for the booklet "Hope" and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1047] That's the booklet "Hope." Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1056] We are glad that you tuned in to the Bible Hour today and we go back to our regular service now as we listen to Denise Mitchell
[time=1062] as she ministers in music for us.
[time=1066] [MUSIC] I was down at the bottom [MUSIC] Digging my own grave [MUSIC] Just look at what a mess you've made of your life [MUSIC] Drowning in my sorrow [MUSIC] Thinking there's no tomorrow [MUSIC] For a loser like me [MUSIC] Would I ever be suffering [MUSIC] I cry, Lord, if I ever need you [MUSIC] I'm needing you tonight [MUSIC] So if you're real, come into my life [MUSIC] And there he was [MUSIC] With his arms open wide [MUSIC] His cotton-blading side [MUSIC] Each drop full of love and freedom [MUSIC] Freedom for you and me [MUSIC] Thank God for Calvary [MUSIC] I want to live to save a man [MUSIC] Who died for you [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] So I told him everything [MUSIC] Even what I wanted to hide [MUSIC] That I wanted to die [MUSIC] I felt so worthless [MUSIC] I'd heard of grace and mercy [MUSIC] But how could he still love me [MUSIC] And I'd done nothing for him [MUSIC] Except live my life in sin [MUSIC] Just as I was turning back [MUSIC] I knew that I could make it [MUSIC] Cry Jesus [MUSIC] Praise Jesus [MUSIC] Save me [MUSIC] And there he was [MUSIC] With his arms open wide [MUSIC] His cotton-blading side [MUSIC] Each drop full of love and freedom [MUSIC] For you and me [MUSIC] Thank God for Calvary [MUSIC] I want to live to save a man [MUSIC] Who died for me [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] [MUSIC] There he was [MUSIC] With his arms open wide [MUSIC] His cotton-blading side [MUSIC] Each drop full of love and freedom [MUSIC] Freedom for you and me [MUSIC] Thank God for Calvary [MUSIC] I want to live to save a man [MUSIC] Who died for me [MUSIC] There he was [MUSIC] With his arms open wide [MUSIC] His cotton-blading side [MUSIC] Each drop full of love and freedom [MUSIC] Freedom for you and me [MUSIC] Thank God for Calvary [MUSIC] I want to live to save a man [MUSIC] Who died for me [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] God is greater than our sorrows [MUSIC] God is greater than our sorrows [MUSIC] He's greater than any failures [MUSIC] That we could ever experience in our lives [MUSIC] If we'll but come to him with those arms [MUSIC] Outstretched for us [MUSIC] Thank God for that [MUSIC] And that's the message of salvation [MUSIC] This morning I came up just before the first service [MUSIC] And I was relieved to see that our guest speaker was here [MUSIC] Steve Longbrake is a cross town [MUSIC] Representing Black Hawk Christian School [MUSIC] And George Lattman is in Israel right now [MUSIC] And Rick as I mentioned is in Colorado [MUSIC] And John Sootch just returned from a grueling river trip [MUSIC] With our young people [MUSIC] And Dale Johnson and I are the only ones left I guess [MUSIC] And neither one of us were just quite sure that we wanted to preach this morning [MUSIC] So it was relieved to see Dr. Sproul [MUSIC] I think we ought to make him an honorary member of our church [MUSIC] He's come frequently to minister to us when our pastor is absent [MUSIC] Dr. Sproul is in the Bible department at Grace College in Seminary [MUSIC] We always welcome him to Black Hawk [MUSIC] We enjoy his ministry with us [MUSIC] He certainly is a man of God that loves to preach the word [MUSIC] And does it in a convincing manner [MUSIC] Let's prepare our hearts now and welcome him to the pulpit [MUSIC] We're glad he's here with us this morning [MUSIC] Dr. Sproul come and minister to us ♪
[time=1438] Well, thank you very much, Peter.
[time=1444] I guess you could say there's no one here but us chickens, huh?
[time=1447] (laughing) Everybody's out of town, not quite.
[time=1452] Open your Bibles, please, to Salmate.
[time=1455] Salmate.
[time=1459] Or we read some of the meditation of David, concerning man and his destiny.
[time=1475] Salmate.
[time=1477] O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth,
[time=1485] you who set your glory above the heavens, how the mouth of babes and infants you have ordained strength because of your enemies, that you may silence the enemy and the avenger.
[time=1497] When I consider your heavens the work of your fingers, by the way, we might pause there and make the comment that whenever the Bible speaks of God's work and natural creation, his bringing into existence worlds and universes, it's described as the work of his fingers, but when it speaks of his work of salvation, it's described as the work of his unbared arm implying by the symbol or the speech that his work of redemption is a much greater work than the work of hurling stars into existence and into space.
[time=1530] When I consider your heavens the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have ordained, what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you visit him, for you have made him a little lower than the angels and you have crowned him with glory and honor.
[time=1547] You have made him to have dominion over the works of your hands.
[time=1550] You have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, even the beasts of the field, the birds of the air and the fish of the sea that pass through the paths of the seas.
[time=1563] O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is your name in all the earth.
[time=1570] Sensories after David wrote this and thought these thoughts, another man also quoted these words and made the connection between these words and the Lord Jesus Christ as the God-man, the one who is this very morning at God's right hand, as the God-man.
[time=1593] I want you to turn through the centuries with me to Hebrews 2, and look at verses 5 through 9 just for a moment this morning, Hebrews 2 verses 5 through 9.
[time=1606] In order to better understand this passage, we have to have some grip on the argument of the author.
[time=1614] We have mentioned this before from this pulpit.
[time=1616] The author is, by a series of contrasts, demonstrating that the Lord Jesus Christ is far greater than anything or anyone found under the Old Covenant.
[time=1627] The Hebrew Christians to whom he is writing are drifting away from their steadfastness in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1634] And so he's writing to call them back to a confidence in him, and they are beginning to turn back to the old ways of the Old Covenant, and so he wants to halt that drift.
[time=1644] And so by a series of comparisons or contrasts, he will show that Jesus Christ, first of all, is far greater than the Old Testament prophets, and he will devote chapter 1 verses 1 through 3 to this theme.
[time=1656] Then beginning at chapter 1 verse 4 through the end of chapter 2, he will argue that Jesus Christ is also far greater than the angels.
[time=1664] He has a far greater name than they.
[time=1666] His name is capital S-O-N, and angels are never called that.
[time=1671] They are referred to as "little-est sons of God" or "banneha elohim," but not "the son of God." That is a unique name that belongs to him.
[time=1680] Furthermore, they serve the throne while he occupies the throne.
[time=1684] They are creatures, and he is the creator of God.
[time=1686] He is far greater than angels.
[time=1688] Then beginning at chapter 3 verse 1 through chapter 4 and verse 14, he will demonstrate that the Lord Jesus Christ is far greater than Moses, Moses was indeed a faithful servant inside the house of God, but Jesus Christ is God who is over the house.
[time=1702] He built the house, and by means of a simple syllogism, he demonstrates that Jesus Christ is far greater than the Moses.
[time=1709] Then picking up at chapter 4 and verse 14 through chapter 10 and verse 18, he will show that Jesus Christ is also far greater than Aaron or anyone found under the old Aaronic priesthood, the old Levitical priesthood.
[time=1722] Jesus Christ is a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
[time=1726] And then chapter 10 verse 19 through the end of the book, simply a series of practical exhortations based upon this exalted Christology.
[time=1735] Now just for a moment this morning, I want you to look at chapter 2 with me.
[time=1739] He's right in the middle of his argument that Jesus Christ is far greater than angels.
[time=1744] He will argue something like this in this section.
[time=1747] Man, not angels, will be in charge of the inhabited earth to come.
[time=1752] That is, of course, redeemed man will be in charge of the inhabited earth to come, not angels.
[time=1758] Jesus Christ is a genuine man, therefore again by a simple syllogism, Jesus Christ is far greater than angels.
[time=1767] Furthermore, he is the guarantee that man in Christ will realize his destiny.
[time=1774] Now with that in mind, let's begin reading in verse 5 of chapter 2 of Hebrews, for he has not put the inhabited earth to come, or in some translations the world to come,
[time=1784] of which we speak in subjection to angels.
[time=1789] But one testified in a certain place saying, "What is man that you are mindful of him, or the son of man that you take care of him?" And of course right here, the author of Hebrews is picking up on the Psalm 8 quotation, "You made him a little lower than the angels.
[time=1803] You crowned him with glory and honor, and sent him over the works of your hands.
[time=1808] You have put all things in subjection under his feet." And that's where he stops quoting the Psalm.
[time=1815] For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.
[time=1822] But now we do not yet see all things put under him.
[time=1827] But we see Jesus note the contrast, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
[time=1834] crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man or for everyone.
[time=1845] Now let's pause there and have prayer.
[time=1848] My father and I pray this morning for divine enablement to preach.
[time=1853] We are frail and needy father, and we recognize that, and we acknowledge that this morning.
[time=1859] Help us our father to see the greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1864] Not only for those in the audience, our father, who are here in the auditorium, but for those who might be viewing our father on the television screen,
[time=1874] who belong to Christ in because of infirmities they cannot move about like they used to in olden days.
[time=1880] We pray our father for them this morning as well.
[time=1884] Give them a fresh glimpse of the greatness of their Savior.
[time=1888] And father, if there is anyone in the auditorium who does not know Christ, may this be the day when they will come to him and acknowledge him as Lord and Savior and the only Savior of men.
[time=1902] Enables our father, take charge of the service, you be pleased with it.
[time=1907] We ask in our father and the Savior's name. Amen.
[time=1914] And he then occurred on October 4, 1957, that was to forever change the course of history.
[time=1921] That was the day when Russia launched Sputnik, the first satellite into orbit,
[time=1928] traveling at a speed of 18,000 miles per hour and making one orbit every 95 minutes.
[time=1935] And from that point on, history has been changed.
[time=1939] And men are asking questions like this.
[time=1942] What is man that you are mindful of him or what is man?
[time=1947] Who is man and where is he going and how much further will he be allowed to go?
[time=1953] This is especially intense since man has placed his feet upon the surface of the moon.
[time=1958] And now people are asking, well, will he go to Mars or beyond Mars?
[time=1963] What is man's destiny? What has God planned for him?
[time=1968] And in the middle of our author of Hebrew's argument about the supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1975] he will demonstrate that man's guarantee of his destiny is to be found in the God man, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1984] Man in Christ will find his destiny in Christ.
[time=1990] And apart from that, there is nothing that awaits man except eternal damnation.
[time=1997] What is man that thou art mindful of him?
[time=2000] If we were to ask that question, by the way, of various segments of the world, we would get a variety of answers.
[time=2006] For example, if you were to ask an anthropologist, what is man?
[time=2010] His response would be something like this, why man is a phylum cordata.
[time=2015] Doesn't that cheer your hearts to know that you're a phylum cordata?
[time=2019] Or he might say, well, man is a subphylum vertebra that's even more cheery, isn't it?
[time=2024] In the final analysis, he would say, well, man, you know, is really a primate.
[time=2028] That's another way of saying he's a monkey.
[time=2031] In fact, one of the dictionaries defines man as a bipedal primate mammal.
[time=2036] And so that's the answer you would get from an anthropologist, an unsaved anthropologist, an unbeliever.
[time=2042] If you were to ask a communist philosopher, what is man?
[time=2046] He would say something like this, why man is the victim of some impersonal logic of history, or of some dialectical materialism, which ultimately drives him to the ant heap of society.
[time=2057] Isn't that cheery?
[time=2060] Or if you were to ask a biologist, what is man?
[time=2064] You might get an answer like this, why man is only a part of nature.
[time=2068] The end product of some undirected evolution doomed to extinction in the cold silences of space.
[time=2076] That also is a very cheerful picture, isn't it?
[time=2082] Even Christians ever now then say some rather facetious things about man.
[time=2087] One of my favorite preachers is the dear old Southern Baptist Vance Havner.
[time=2094] If you've never heard him preach and if he's still living for another year, why make sure you hear him if he's anywhere near you.
[time=2103] He said about 15 years ago at Winona Lake Bible Conference, a statement like this, he said, "I've stopped saying that man is going to the dogs out of respect for dogs."
[time=2116] And he was right, you know.
[time=2118] He went on to say that man is doing things that is beneath the dignity of the canine family.
[time=2126] We just came back from New York City, we were within six blocks, lived there for about five days within six blocks of Times Square, and you can see it all around you.
[time=2136] By the way, you don't need to go to Times Square to see it.
[time=2140] It's all over the world.
[time=2142] Well, what is man?
[time=2144] When you come to the Bible, you get an amazingly different answer.
[time=2148] Man is presented as the crown of God's creation.
[time=2152] He is the crown prince, far greater than any other part of God's creation.
[time=2158] Greater than angels, and God has planned that man rule and reign over all of his creation.
[time=2165] All of it.
[time=2166] All parts of nature.
[time=2168] All of the world.
[time=2170] Man is the rule over it.
[time=2173] But the problem, of course, is stated in the text in verse eight, the last part, but now we do not yet see all things put under him.
[time=2182] But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crown of glory and honor, that he by the grace of God might taste death for everyone or for every man.
[time=2195] He, of course, here in the middle of this text, is quoting from Psalm 8, those meditations of David centuries earlier.
[time=2202] As David lay out amongst the starry heavens at night, as a young shepherd boy, and we're looking to the heavens and wonder about man and the awesomeness of God's creation, well, what is man that you're even mindful of him?
[time=2216] This must have been a startling thing to David as it has been to millions of others.
[time=2220] When we think of God's awesomeness and his greatness and man's apparent weakness and his inability
[time=2227] to do hardly anything right, man is supposed to be in charge of all of God's creation,
[time=2233] including all the great forests, all the great oak trees, or the sequoias.
[time=2239] And yet he doesn't let to be as old as an oak tree.
[time=2242] His longevity is amazingly short, distressingly short, and yet God has created him to rule over all things.
[time=2252] What's the problem?
[time=2254] Furthermore, he has very little knowledge. He thinks he's very smart, man does.
[time=2259] But if somehow you could garner all of the knowledge that is yet to be discovered or learned
[time=2265] and liken it to the size of the Pacific Ocean, that which man has learned up to this point
[time=2272] would fill only a thimble.
[time=2275] So, you know, in the final analysis, man is, you know, a bit of a numb skull.
[time=2281] He has a very short life, doesn't live to be as old as an oak tree.
[time=2288] He doesn't know very much yet, although he's discovered many things, but imagine the potential of man.
[time=2297] Furthermore, he is powerless in the face of all the forces of nature.
[time=2302] I've never yet heard of any man who challenged a hurricane.
[time=2306] Several years ago, I was preaching in Biloxi, Mississippi, and it was right after, well, within a year or two after, Camille had swept through that community and shredded all the buildings, and the steel girders were still standing.
[time=2318] They had not yet been repaired, and it was a very somber testimony to the force of that storm.
[time=2325] I have never heard of anyone who, when he heard that a storm was rolling in from the Gulf Coast, or the Gulf waters walked out, and with his hands outstretched said, "Storm, stop!"
[time=2336] I can think of a few fellas of Biloxi, try that maybe, but I don't know if any of them have tried that.
[time=2341] We're so helpless, we're powerless, we have short lives.
[time=2347] We know so little in comparison with that which we could learn, or that which is yet to be learned.
[time=2356] And it bothered David, and it bothered the author of Hebrews, and it bothers us.
[time=2361] Years ago, when one of our great preachers was preaching right after Sputnik was launched, a woman came up to him after the service, and she said, "I don't care what you preach," or saying, "That thing referring to Sputnik has come between me and my God." Now, she didn't mean she had lost faith in God, but she meant that somehow that bothered her.
[time=2379] Where was man going? What is he going to be able to do?
[time=2382] And furthermore, what has happened to him?
[time=2385] One of our great writers is a man by the name of G.K. Chesterton.
[time=2391] He made a statement like this one time, he said, "Whatever else is or is not true, this one thing is certain, man is not what he was meant to be." And that's right.
[time=2402] Man is not what he was meant to be. Well, what in heaven's name has happened?
[time=2407] Man has become the enemy of God.
[time=2410] Back in the previous chapter, by the way, verse 13, we read of it, "But to which of the angels has he ever said, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.'
[time=2419] God has enemies. Man has become the enemy of God in the fall."
[time=2427] And so man is not mastering creation. He seems to be mastered by creation.
[time=2433] He is not ruling over creation. He seems to be enslaved by creation.
[time=2437] He has no strength because he has been rendered powerless.
[time=2443] And yet he still senses within his breast his ultimate destiny.
[time=2449] Man senses that somehow he has been made to rule and reign over all the earth.
[time=2455] And the world has seen its share of the Kleros and Charlemanes and Alexander's the great and Geneschons and all those men, Adolf Hitler's and all the rest,
[time=2466] who in their own way are trying to gain control or trying to gain control over all the earth.
[time=2471] He senses within his breast that he has been created to rule and reign.
[time=2477] And he has tried to storm God's throne and God has had to push him down.
[time=2481] We read about that in Genesis chapter 3, "The Fall of Man." And so man has become the enemy of God.
[time=2488] And it appears as though there's no hope for man.
[time=2493] Someone has said that the Bible is a bloody book.
[time=2498] They said it in a derogatory sense, but the Bible you know is a bloody book in one sense because the Bible presents man as he really is.
[time=2507] And man is a bloody creature.
[time=2512] And the Bible does not give us any Pollyanna.
[time=2515] It presents man as he precisely is.
[time=2517] And so we read in the Bible about patriarch visiting a prostitute.
[time=2522] It's not very pretty.
[time=2524] Wars and rumors of wars and all kinds of bloody deeds because man is a bloody creature.
[time=2532] And we wonder about that.
[time=2535] Where is man going?
[time=2538] Will he ever realize his destiny to rule and reign?
[time=2544] Sometimes when we think like this we think of men like Hitler or some other famous man
[time=2550] or individual who did a lot of cruel things.
[time=2554] But let your mind go back to the Old Testament to one of your favorites, David.
[time=2560] And you recall the account of his standing in front of Goliath that day and all that happened and the joy that surged through you as you read about that event.
[time=2569] Here's this huge hulk of a man, Goliath.
[time=2573] And David is given some armor and it's soul's armor and David doesn't about face
[time=2580] and the armor doesn't move.
[time=2582] And so he says I can't use this stuff.
[time=2584] So he got out of it.
[time=2586] And he got a sling and some smooth stones.
[time=2590] And he walked toward that giant.
[time=2593] And that giant Philistin said, "What am I?
[time=2596] A dog that you come out to me with kids and staves and sticks?" He said, "Come here little boy, I'll take your head off." Remember what David said?
[time=2608] "You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin.
[time=2612] But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
[time=2618] who you have defied this day, and I am going to remove your hand." And he did.
[time=2624] What a man. What a boy. What a runny youth.
[time=2630] But now a few years pass and he's now king standing on his rooftop and he looks about.
[time=2642] And over on another rooftop he sees a beautiful woman.
[time=2647] And before long all of this lust begins to well up in David.
[time=2653] And before long he is involved in adultery and then murder.
[time=2658] David, good heavens, how could you do that?
[time=2666] The sweet singer of Israel.
[time=2669] A man after God's own heart.
[time=2671] The man whom God appointed king over all of Israel.
[time=2674] How could you possibly do that?
[time=2678] He composed seventy-three of our songs.
[time=2681] We read about him all the time.
[time=2686] Move on to the New Testament.
[time=2691] On that dark day, in the night before when another man stands tall behind or next to a fire warming his hands.
[time=2703] He'll not swerve or waver.
[time=2706] He has already promised the Lord, though all men forsake you, I will not forsake you.
[time=2712] And by the way he meant that.
[time=2716] But now the testing comes.
[time=2719] And before the accusing finger of a little Jewish maid, Peter with a curse on his mouth says, "I don't know him.
[time=2728] I never knew him." And we say, "Peter, how could you do that?" Well let me ask this.
[time=2742] Would you have done any better?
[time=2750] What is man that you are mindful of him?
[time=2754] And the son of man that you visit him.
[time=2757] And so you see you have what apparently is a very large problem.
[time=2760] Not large for God, but it's presented here by the author of Hebrews as a problem.
[time=2765] Because we look at history and we see wars and rumors of wars and senseless savagery.
[time=2771] And we look at nature and we see thorns and thistles.
[time=2777] And yet God has promised man rule and reign over all of his creation.
[time=2782] Man in Christ that is.
[time=2786] And so he highlights the problem in the last part of verse 8.
[time=2789] But now we do not yet see all things put under him.
[time=2793] By the way, when Martin Luther came to this text, he called it a notice deo wendica dignoose, a knot that requires God to unravel.
[time=2806] God promising all this to man, yet man being evidently under all of it, not mastering any of it.
[time=2813] God, how are you going to figure this one out?
[time=2816] But now we see not yet all things put under him.
[time=2822] But we see Jesus.
[time=2826] By the way, that word in verse 8, that word for see, is a word that means you look and you think and you ponder what you're looking at
[time=2836] and you draw some conclusions and you think about it.
[time=2839] It's a meditative word, in other words, as I look out at man today all around the world,
[time=2845] whether it's in New York or Warsaw, Indiana, same man.
[time=2850] He seems to be mastered by creation, all seems to be an absolute mess.
[time=2857] And I wonder when in the world it's ever going to change.
[time=2861] Man seems to be going downhill all the time.
[time=2865] And if he's advancing technologically, he's digressing or he is regressing morally.
[time=2874] Where's he going?
[time=2877] And I look at that and I think about it and you do also.
[time=2881] Where in heaven's name is he going?
[time=2885] That's the word in verse 8.
[time=2887] But then when you come to verse 9, it's still translated see in English, but it's a different Greek word.
[time=2893] It's one of the first words you ever learn in a Greek class.
[time=2896] It's blepho.
[time=2897] Everyone can say blepho.
[time=2898] It means I see.
[time=2899] And it means just a glance.
[time=2903] So what's the author saying here through the Holy Spirit?
[time=2906] He's saying, John, when you look out of the world around you and you see all of this mess, all of this tragedy, all of this sickness, all that's going on and you wonder where in heaven's name is man going.
[time=2918] And when you're depressed about that, just take a glance up at my right hand because there is one there who is the guarantee of man's ultimate destiny in Christ.
[time=2929] His name is Jesus Christ.
[time=2934] And he is there as I speak this morning as the God man.
[time=2938] Make sure you say it all, the God man, absolutely God, but he's a genuine man, no docetic Christ, a genuine man at God's right hand.
[time=2948] And he is man's guarantee of his ultimate destiny.
[time=2953] He has been to earth.
[time=2955] He has lived his life.
[time=2957] He has died the death that brings death its death.
[time=2960] He has been raised from the dead.
[time=2962] He has ascended up to the right hand of God the Father.
[time=2965] And there he is right now as the God man.
[time=2969] Say it all, God man.
[time=2971] Because you see, sometimes we don't think of it like that.
[time=2975] We fail to realize that before the incarnation, that God the Son existed eternally.
[time=2983] He has always existed.
[time=2984] He is the eternal Son of God.
[time=2986] But he was not a man then.
[time=2988] He was not a man.
[time=2989] He became a man at a point in history at the incarnation.
[time=2992] And from that point on there was no turning back for Christ.
[time=2996] In chapter 10 of Hebrews he will write, or it will be written of him, "I come to do thy will, O God." And he could not say, "Oh, well, I see it's going to be such a horrible mess.
[time=3008] I want to come back, Father.
[time=3009] I want to come back home." And today as I preach, there is a man.
[time=3018] That's the point.
[time=3019] There is a man at God's right hand.
[time=3022] He's been down here in the dust with us.
[time=3025] He knows what it is to anguish and to suffer and to be in misery.
[time=3029] And that one is right now praying for me, and he's praying for you if you belong to him.
[time=3037] W.R. Maltby said it right when he said it like this.
[time=3042] In the incarnation, Jesus Christ betrothed himself to the human race forever for better or for worse.
[time=3049] That's right.
[time=3051] No turning back for Christ.
[time=3056] How do you see him this morning?
[time=3061] How do you see him?
[time=3065] Paul writes in 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 5, "There is one God and one mediator between God and man,
[time=3073] the man Christ Jesus."
[time=3079] Just for a moment, let your minds go back there to that dark and ominous day.
[time=3085] And suppose you're standing there observing the three crosses and the crucifixion that is taking place.
[time=3096] And your eye focuses upon that one on the center cross.
[time=3102] And you're curious.
[time=3104] You see a man standing over here who has armor on.
[time=3108] He's dressed like a soldier.
[time=3110] And you walk up and you say, "Sir, that one on the center cross, why are they killing him?"
[time=3116] He says, "Well, haven't you heard?" He was an insurrectionist.
[time=3120] That's why we're killing him.
[time=3122] And you say to yourself, "Well, he doesn't look like an insurrectionist to me." And then you see a man dressed up in religious garb standing over here.
[time=3130] And you walk up to him and you say, "Sir, that one on the center cross, why are they killing him?"
[time=3138] He says, "Why haven't you heard?" He was a blasphemer.
[time=3143] That's why we're killing him.
[time=3145] He blasphemered God.
[time=3148] He claimed to be God.
[time=3150] That's why we're killing him.
[time=3153] You see, he doesn't look like a blasphemer to me.
[time=3157] And then you see a lady standing here.
[time=3160] She's crying.
[time=3163] And you say to her, "That one on the center cross, why are they killing him?" And through her tears and her sobbs, she says, "I don't know.
[time=3171] I don't know." He was the best man who ever lived.
[time=3176] All he did was go about doing good things, getting eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, and feet to the lame.
[time=3182] I don't know why they're killing him.
[time=3185] Excuse me.
[time=3189] And you see another lady standing over here and a man standing next to her.
[time=3193] His name is John.
[time=3198] Standing by Mary.
[time=3201] And she is weeping uncontrollably because a sword has pierced her heart.
[time=3209] And so you ask John, "That one on the center cross, why are they killing him?"
[time=3218] Now you get your answer.
[time=3222] He says, "I'll tell you why." He is God the Son.
[time=3227] He is also the God-man.
[time=3230] And he is dying there for the sins of men.
[time=3233] That's why he's being killed.
[time=3235] That's why he's dying.
[time=3237] And it's absolutely right.
[time=3241] No other way to God except through Jesus Christ.
[time=3244] No church as good as that church might be can ever take you to God.
[time=3248] No church can do it.
[time=3251] And thank God for the many godly churches we have abroad in the land.
[time=3254] I thank God for them.
[time=3256] But the church cannot do it.
[time=3258] No baptismal wars can take you to Jesus Christ or to God the Father.
[time=3263] Apart from Christ there is no hope.
[time=3268] He died in our place.
[time=3271] He's my guarantee.
[time=3277] God the Father.
[time=3279] Hear me now.
[time=3281] There was a day when God the Father had to put his own son up on the tree.
[time=3285] And God the Father in the final analysis killed his own son.
[time=3290] Paul will write years later in Romans 8, "He who spared not his own son, but delivered him a
[time=3296] force all, how shall he not with him also free to give us all things."
[time=3306] God the Father slaying his own son.
[time=3311] Several years ago in Florida, George Buttrick tells the story of a chess game that was going on out in the public.
[time=3317] And two masters were playing and around them were other masters of the game observing.
[time=3323] And after about two hours of his observing, he heard one of the onlookers say, "That's it.
[time=3331] That's it." Because one of the players had just made the move that would forever determine the destiny of that game, the outcome of that game.
[time=3344] And when sin put the Lord Jesus Christ upon that cross, and God the Father killed his own son for men, God said, "That's it.
[time=3355] That's it.
[time=3357] That's the decisive move that guarantees man's destiny in his future.
[time=3363] Man in Christ.
[time=3366] In Christ.
[time=3369] What is man that thou art in mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him?"
[time=3381] I'll tell you who he is.
[time=3384] He's God's crowning creation, who has fallen away from God.
[time=3393] All men are like that, and the only way back to God is through the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3404] You know, sometimes, and I don't linger on this, sometimes you almost feel sorry for Satan, don't you? Not quite.
[time=3412] There in the garden he approaches the first man, with temptation, and that man falls, and all of mankind fell with him, every man, a fallen preacher.
[time=3426] Sensories later, another man appears upon the scene, the God-man.
[time=3432] Now Satan approaches him, and throws all kinds of temptation his way, but that man doesn't swerve.
[time=3441] He remains steadfast in his faithfulness to Jehovah.
