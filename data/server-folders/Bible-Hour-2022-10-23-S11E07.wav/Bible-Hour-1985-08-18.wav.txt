[time=208] - Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=217] We want to welcome you this morning to our second worship service.
[time=221] In the last hour, we had opportunity to lift our voices together and praise and to sing it as well, it as well with my soul.
[time=230] The study God's word to hear from our choir and from read the favor who's come to minister to us in music today, but most of all, we're thankful that you're here.

[time=262] Listen now as Kerry Johnson sings and our choir sings a great anthem of medley of songs that give peace to our hearts and praise to our God.

[time=614] One hundred, four hundred, seventeen.
[time=617] Excuse me.

[time=796] - Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=807] We appreciate it again when you participate and bless our hearts as you sing back to us.
[time=813] We have the privilege today of having Reid and Diane LaFavor with us.
[time=817] Reid is the minister of music at the Sonny Chris Baptist Church in Marion, Indiana.
[time=821] He was one of the students that I had in my first junior high class.
[time=826] I was very young and he was a very old student.
[time=828] That was just a few years ago.
[time=831] We've had a great relationship in music and in friendship throughout the years and we're just delighted that on their vacation they chose to visit Blackhawk and I said, well, you can't sit, you've got to sing.
[time=841] So let's listen now as Reid blesses us with music and the Lord bless you Reid as you sing.
[time=846] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=926] And then the death that he died, for sinners crucified, what grace is this, what grace is this, what condescension, how can it be?
[time=956] What shame he suffered, oh the agony, and then that death that he died, for sinners crucified, what grace is this, what grace is this,
[time=986] again welcome to the Bible hour, it's a great feeling but almost a strange feeling for Pete and I to be sitting here together, I didn't count but it's been quite a few weeks since we both have been here.
[time=1002] I think you mentioned it's been about two months since we've both been on the insert together and I'd like to be the first to welcome you back from your great trip that you had last week.
[time=1010] Now we're delighted to be home, we certainly had a great time ministering in the Rocky Mountains, you know if you have to go somewhere to speak that's not a bad spot to go to.
[time=1018] I think that was good planning on your part, I understand they even had some snow while you were there.
[time=1022] It was really a strange experience to wake up one morning and to look out across the valley and see snow covered mountains not just where the sun never melts it but a fresh dusting snow down to about oh eight to nine thousand feet and we were at about seventy five hundred feet so it was right above us.
[time=1038] Sounds like an exciting time, I'm sure that they benefited from your ministry and I hope that you got some rest too and are prepared for a good fall.
[time=1046] Well Kathy and I had a great time and we couldn't have been more thrilled with the privilege of serving the Lord by speaking to these fourteen to fifteen hundred young people who were so hungry.
[time=1054] That it was a joy for us and Kathy sang and we did take an extra day coming home and stayed in Denver and relaxed and had a great time but it sure is good to be home and to be back here at Blackhawk.
[time=1064] Rick we've been talking in the last few weeks about the fall program and in particular September 8th that's going to be our fall kickoff and we've titled it Proclaim His Praise and I'm sure looking forward to a great time of celebration that morning.
[time=1078] So my, Peter, as I look back on how God has so uniquely blessed us in these last months it is most important that we give him the glory and the praise and the credit for that.
[time=1090] I think it's just going to be a worship service, Rick, of reflection on what God has done for our church because financially and spiritually we've had a wonderful summer.
[time=1098] Our people have been faithful, we've had a lot of visitors and our mail has been very good this summer.
[time=1102] We've read a lot of letters from the Bible hour people and we're just rejoicing in the Lord because of all of this.
[time=1110] You know when you mention that I particularly think of a phone call in the letter that we received from a lady whose husband had been terminally ill with cancer and he was watching the Bible hour one day when she was not there and when she came home she discovered that he had made a fresh and new and real commitment to Christ.
[time=1128] That's why we're on the air, Rick, just to tell people that Jesus Christ is still alive and can dwell in the hearts of individuals today.
[time=1134] Well we want to thank you for joining us and we want to share a pamphlet with you on hope.
[time=1140] It comes from one of my very favorite writers and Bible teachers, his name is Charles Swindall and this booklet is a pamphlet we want to send you free as a way of strengthening your faith and your hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1152] The pamphlet is very simple to read, very practical, yet very deep in its spiritual content.
[time=1158] Pete I know you've been sharing with the people in recent weeks.
[time=1160] Rick I've just used it I think every day I've sent it to several of the people and my friends that have had difficulties in recent weeks and it's amazing what the human goes through in a lifetime and all the struggles.
[time=1172] But if we don't lose hope we have a sure foundation in Jesus Christ that we can persevere through the struggles and trials that come our way.
[time=1180] So we want to encourage you to write for the booklet hope and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1192] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1198] Pete I know last week Steve Longbreak was on with you. Steve is the administrator of our Christian school and we're very excited about our school and the potential that it has to train young people.
[time=1210] As I mentioned we were just with fourteen to fifteen hundred young people and they came from all types of background and we were particularly impressed with two youth groups that sent a variety of young people and many of them had received training in the Christian school.
[time=1222] And their ability to share God's word they had memorized lengthy passages of the Bible for their quiz programs and their ability to share that and they had a preaching contest and music contest we were so encouraged.
[time=1234] And it's not to say that the Christian school kids were only ones that did well that's not true but there was just a distinct mark of difference between youth groups that had the benefit of a Christian school they were so far ahead.
[time=1246] And we want to propose to you the idea that Christian education is one of the greatest investments you can make in your young people.
[time=1254] Our motto is simply this, academic excellence on a biblical foundation. By that we mean that we're not going to sacrifice anything academically. Our standards in English and math and the basic college preparatory classes is no lower as a matter of fact it's higher than most other places and yet all that's on a biblical foundation which we think is so crucial.
[time=1274] Well I know that our administrator Steve Longbreak is very excited because we are about to have the highest enrollment we've ever had in the history of the school and he's been working very hard this summer and we're just excited about the people that are coming.
[time=1286] Well we're looking forward to that we have about 288 registered and our goal is 300 we've more or less just established that informally so we have 12 more people that we're hoping to attract in about the next 12 days before school begins so that's not too far away.
[time=1302] It's hard to believe that school is beginning in just a few short days.
[time=1306] Well it's very special for us because this year our oldest daughter Rachel goes off to school for the first time. It's only a half day and I think that's a good way for not only Rachel to break into school but I think it's a good way for mom to break into a daughter leaving home too.
[time=1318] Well thank you for joining us today as we return to the Bible hours live portion away from this pre-recorded time with you. We want to encourage you to stay with us as our friend in the ministry read continues to minister in music.
[time=1330] And then we studied the life of Timothy the pattern of a believer. I hope you'll stay with us. God bless you.
[time=1360] It was the message that came to my heart how that Jesus alone for my sin did at home.
[time=1380] Covering covers it all.
[time=1396] All my past with its sin and it stayed. All of my guilt and my despair Jesus took on him there.
[time=1414] And cover it all.
[time=1424] How matches the grace when I look on the face of this Jesus my crucified Lord.
[time=1442] My redemption complete and found at his feet.
[time=1452] And cover it all.
[time=1460] Oh cover recovers it covers it all. All my ugly past with its sin and it stayed. All of my guilt and my despair.
[time=1482] My Jesus he took on him there. And cover it all.
[time=1502] Thank you read. Let us bow together in prayer. Our God and our Father we come today and we've been reminded of Calvary.
[time=1510] We think of your son the Lord Jesus our Savior dying. Father a sense of gratitude overwhelms us.
[time=1522] Like a weight sits upon us and we are all struck that you would love us not because of us but in spite of us.
[time=1532] Father we thank you that in your love that you didn't lower your standard of perfection that you decided to forgive our imperfection.
[time=1542] God many of us today have either actively or passively ignored you. Some of us have boxed you out of our life and have ignored you.
[time=1552] Others of us have received you and treated you so lightly. Father today were humbled as were reminded of Calvary that Jesus died and that was my sin that nailed him to that cross.
[time=1566] God we are today thankful and so we've come to worship you and to lift our voices and our hearts and to praise you. Many of us today God prays you out of a full heart.
[time=1576] Kathy and I rejoice today in all that you've given to us with a full heart we thank you. Others today are here on the wings of eagles and they're soaring and they give praise from the mountain tops.
[time=1590] God their others today who are trying to give a word of praise because their life is swallowed in the miseries of the shallows. Many today have suffered tragic loss of loved ones.
[time=1602] We pray for Helen Peters and the loss of her grandson. We pray for the dable family. We pray for those who've not only lost loved ones through death but who have lost through divorce through rejection.
[time=1616] Many today sit alone unless you sit with them. God today we pray that you would comfort those hearts and you'd give a new vision for life.
[time=1626] God do each of us today regardless of our situation. Help our hearts to know a measure of joy that you can give.
[time=1634] We pray today for the heart of one who might come today uncertain of their own spiritual life that you might give them certainty and clarity.
[time=1644] We pray for those who would come today who'd never have asked Christ into their heart that they might experience the forgiveness and the birth that He gives.
[time=1652] Through your word father we ask you to teach us and to build us. In Jesus name amen.
[time=1658] Benjamin Franklin had an idea. He tested the idea and he was sure that it would work.
[time=1666] And he took his idea to the farming community of his day and he told the farmers that as strange as this sounds if you will so plaster in your soil your crops will multiply and your yield will be much more abundant.
[time=1684] They looked at Franklin with a view of disbelief and sent him out but continually he explained to them that plaster had some properties in it that did something to the soil.
[time=1694] We know that it's the lime content now but that it would help the soil to be more plentiful. No one would take his advice.
[time=1704] So one year he bought his own ground. He went out to sow it and in a few select spots here and there he sowed some plaster and left the rest of the ground as it was.
[time=1716] As the seasons brought forth the rain and the rain brought forth the crops there were certain areas where the crops were significantly taller early in the season.
[time=1726] More plentiful and obviously going to have a richer yield. The wisdom of Franklin was amazing. He just didn't pick out spots but he traced with the plaster these letters that spelled out the words.
[time=1742] This ground was sown in plaster. Suddenly he gained the whole attention of the farming community. It's amazing how much you can talk and how much you can explain and how much you can say but people really don't get the message until they see an example.
[time=1760] The same is true with the Christian life. We can explain about it. We can share Christ but until most people see an example they're really not going to believe and they're really not going to receive.
[time=1774] More than anything else the Bible says that we are to be role models. We are to be patterns. We are to be representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1784] Open your Bible that we can study together this morning from 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12. All summer long we've been looking at the concept the lives of believers as examples.
[time=1796] You may remember way back in June we talked about Barnabas. He was an example of what an encourager. Caleb was a visionary. Abigail was a peacemaker.
[time=1808] Today we look at the life of Timothy who was an example of a believer. Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was someone very dear to Paul. Paul called him my son in the faith.
[time=1820] Paul had led Timothy to Christ on one of his early missionary journeys and now much later in life 15 years or so he writes to him two letters of encouragement and instruction.
[time=1832] The first we call 1 Timothy and in chapter 4 verse 12 Paul speaks these words to Timothy originally but to each of us today.
[time=1844] Let no man despise thy youth but in contrast to that be thou an example of the believer in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
[time=1862] Paul said Timothy don't let anyone despise you but instead let everyone respect you because you're an example of the believer.
[time=1870] If you're a gramarian today there are two sentences here put in contrast by that little word but the first is a negative command. Stop doing something or don't do something.
[time=1880] The second is a positive command. In many ways Paul was saying to Timothy minimize your liabilities and maximize your assets.
[time=1890] He begins by talking about one of Timothy's liabilities and that was that he was a little bit younger than people expected him to be.
[time=1898] He begins with the phrase don't let anyone despise. Now when you and I think of despise it's a little different than the concept. When I think of despise I think a lima beans. What do you think of?
[time=1910] There are very very few foods that I don't enjoy and most of them that I don't enjoy I can tolerate but I want to tell you I despise lima beans.
[time=1922] I have had lima beans I think every way you can make them and you can't make them so they taste good.
[time=1926] I despise them. Now this word doesn't mean to find something totally repugnant lima beans it simply means to regard something as to be dismissed.
[time=1938] It means to push aside exactly what I do when the lima beans come you push them aside.
[time=1946] What was happening to Timothy is Timothy was walking on the scene sent by the Apostle Paul sent by God to do a job and people said Timothy you're a fine young man.
[time=1960] And someday Timothy you're really going to do something for the Lord and they underlined the words young and someday and it was a very subtle way of saying Timothy that's real good but don't expect us to follow you.
[time=1982] They wanted to dismiss him or at least to discount his message because he had in their eyes a particular liability at his case it happened to be youthfulness.
[time=1996] Now youthfulness when I think of youthfulness I think that youth is somewhere in the late teens their early 20s. I've discovered something that those years change as you get older.
[time=2010] But I think in our culture most of us would think that somebody is youthful in their 20s and we began to think of the 30s as young middle age.
[time=2018] Timothy was probably somewhere around 35 maybe 40 years old. How do we get that? Well it's speculative I must admit.
[time=2026] But Paul led Timothy to Christ on one of his early missionary journeys and it gives us the impression that Timothy is a grown young man.
[time=2036] Late adolescence perhaps early 20s and that happened 15 years prior to this epistle. So Timothy is probably somewhere around 35. I would have to consider that the prime of life.
[time=2050] I'll be 33 this year. That's the prime of life. My dad turned 50 a few weeks ago and somebody told me he was in the middle of life.
[time=2060] He said yeah I've got all these friends running around who are 100. I know I'm in the middle of life. Oh you know age is rather relative but in that culture my age the 30s was considered a little bit on the young side.
[time=2074] They and their wisdom had a great deal of honor for the older as our generation needs to learn. But there were those who were older and they expected someone older and they wanted to push Timothy aside because he had a liability.
[time=2088] You know I've discovered something though every one of us has a liability. Every one of us has something about our life that we're less than perfect.
[time=2100] As at this conference and listening to people talk about all the pastors and this one's like this guy and that one's like this guy and you know I never heard anybody they said was just ideal.
[time=2110] I don't know of anybody who's better than MacArthur and Swindall and yet there were people saying well you know Swindall he's great on application but he strays from the text occasionally.
[time=2122] Well maybe he does but he sure is good. Somebody else said well MacArthur who always like somebody else says no MacArthur he's too dogmatic.
[time=2130] Oh yes when John was here one night and speaking our Bible conference he said I know I'm right if I wasn't I changed my mind.
[time=2142] Okay everybody's got a different personality. You discover something this person is good because they're young this person's not good because they're too young this person's good because they're authoritative no they're not they're dogmatic.
[time=2154] This guy's great because he's got application no no he doesn't stay true to every verb he discovers something and Landers was right.
[time=2164] She wrote a little article saying what do people look for in their pastor. He said they're looking for someone who's 25 years old with 15 years of experience.
[time=2174] Doesn't happen does it. You know that's not only true of people who hold down my job by way of occupation it's true of yours isn't it.
[time=2184] That everybody expects that when you take off your shirt underneath is this blue t-shirt with the red letter S and that you're Superman.
[time=2192] You're nothing but assets no liabilities you're strong in every area and there are those who look at you but they have discovered a liability in your personality and your character and your abilities.
[time=2202] And what they're going to do is they're going to hold that liability up constantly and as they hold that liability up that's their way of skirting the issue.
[time=2214] You wanted to share the Lord Jesus Christ with them and they go to your liability as a way of ignoring your message of discounting your testimony for Christ.
[time=2226] What's Paul saying here Timothy you've got a liability Paul had liabilities each of us have areas that we're not strong in.
[time=2236] That doesn't mean that we don't have a legitimate right to serve Christ and to share Christ in this community.
[time=2246] And what are you saying here is a negative command which actually means stop letting people push you aside.
[time=2256] You've got something to share in your office in your neighborhood in your factory wherever you live and work and move and you have contacts you've got something to share.
[time=2266] It's the light of Jesus Christ don't let anybody simply say no thanks and push you aside.
[time=2274] Well how are you going to get them to listen you're going to fight.
[time=2276] Listen here Fred I've worked next to you for 15 years and I haven't enjoyed that so you're not going to enjoy this.
[time=2282] Now listen to this God loves you Fred.
[time=2286] I don't know that that will probably be in the next chapter in the Christian version of how to win friends and influence people.
[time=2294] We're going to fight Paul didn't say Timothy you get up there and you assert your authority.
[time=2298] Timothy you go into that Paul and you say now Paul sent me.
[time=2304] I'm discouraged from time to time and one of the things that discouraged me is when people in my position pastors constantly beat the congregation with their own authority.
[time=2316] I'm the pastor here you know why I'm the pastor here because you voted yes and you may vote no.
[time=2322] That's the only way I have authority is because you have given it to me.
[time=2326] You've laid it on me as a trust and I know some you could take it away.
[time=2332] Paul didn't say Timothy you go in there and you roll up your sleeves and you tell them you're a hired gun sent by the Apostle Paul.
[time=2338] Now here's how he said you're going to win them.
[time=2342] He said don't let anybody push you aside but instead win them by being an example of the believer in six ways.
[time=2350] He says you be an example of the believer.
[time=2354] That little word example we've mentioned this before means to set an image to make a pattern.
[time=2360] This past week we went through an indoor mall in Denver it was a beautiful spot and there were all these different artisans and there was this one lady making leather belts it was fascinating.
[time=2372] She took what was a plain strip of leather that obviously was going to become a belt but it was just plain leather.
[time=2378] And in front of her she had all these tools I don't know what the columns all call them punches.
[time=2382] And at the other end of each punch was a different emblem.
[time=2386] And she took this leather belt out she took her punch and she smacked it with a hammer and it made a dash that looked kind of dumb to me.
[time=2394] And she made dashes all over this thing.
[time=2398] But then she turned the belt around and she made dashes back the other way and put a line through the middle and each one of those marks became a grain of wheat.
[time=2408] And it was beautiful.
[time=2410] Then she took another pattern and she whacked it around in all these different places and it was just a circle and the circle looked kind of dumb.
[time=2418] And then she took another punch and she had smacked around those circles and those turned into wildflowers.
[time=2424] It was beautiful.
[time=2426] It was a craft that was made by the stroke that made a print.
[time=2430] That is the word topos here it means a strike that makes a print.
[time=2436] You and I, we are to live our lives in such a way that we make a stroke and a print that becomes a pattern that represents the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2450] The apostle Paul said, "Timothy, be a pattern." He wrote to the Corinthians he says, "You, Corinthians, you follow me just as I am a follower of Christ.
[time=2460] We are to be raw models, we are to be patterns for one another.
[time=2464] We are to be examples.
[time=2466] But notice to whom and of what we are to be examples.
[time=2470] Usually I think why I've got to walk wisely.
[time=2472] You better walk sharply because there are people out there who need to know Christ.
[time=2478] All that's true and don't ever lose your grasp on that concept.
[time=2482] But here he's saying we're not only to be an example to those who don't know Christ but that we are to be an example of a believer to one another.
[time=2492] Do you know why we've come together today?
[time=2496] We say, "Well, some of us have come because we like the music.
[time=2500] Some of us have come to worship.
[time=2502] We've come to study the scriptures.
[time=2504] We've come for this." But you know one of the key reasons why we are to be here today.
[time=2508] One of the key reasons is found in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 25 it says that we are not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the habit of some more.
[time=2520] But instead we are to come together.
[time=2522] Why?
[time=2522] So that we can stimulate so that we can provoke so that we can encourage each other under good works.
[time=2528] I am here today because I want to be with you because some of you challenge me in ways that I've never been challenged before.
[time=2536] Some of you people to rub alongside of you sharpens me just like iron sharpens iron.
[time=2540] Soul man's countenance is sharpened by his friends.
[time=2544] We're here to spark and to stimulate and encourage each other.
[time=2548] A brief application of all of this.
[time=2552] If you've made your habit of watching television because you can't get out, we're thankful you're watching.
[time=2558] But if you've made your habit of watching television simply because it's convenient, you're missing out on what church is all about.
[time=2566] Church isn't my message and it's not our choir.
[time=2568] It's the body of people coming together to stimulate each other.
[time=2572] I look at some of you and I see how some of you stimulate a bunch of junior high kids.
[time=2576] You come out stimulated too.
[time=2578] But some of you go into an adult Sunday school class and there you have a gift of encouragement.
[time=2584] And some of you can find a person who is a stranger to everyone else in the world but you'll make them at home.
[time=2590] And you'll accept them and you'll receive them.
[time=2592] Some of you have an amazing ability to care and to encourage and to support.
[time=2596] That's why we meet together.
[time=2598] And as we come together, assembled here where to be patterns, not simply for those out there, but for us in here.
[time=2608] In the British Museum there is a Greek manuscript that was obviously a teaching tool.
[time=2614] And on this manuscript the teacher wrote a Greek phrase.
[time=2620] And the students would learn to write by writing right below the teachers.
[time=2624] The first student could write right below the teachers and he would simply copy the letters.
[time=2630] But unfortunately the second student goofed.
[time=2632] He didn't copy the teachers which was now two lines up.
[time=2636] He copied the first students who was right above his and the first students made some mistakes.
[time=2642] And so he duplicated not only the correct letters but the errant letters.
[time=2646] And the third student copied the second students who made errors that the first student made and then a few of his own.
[time=2652] And hence you had a delusion of what was supposed to be there.
[time=2658] And as you go down the sheet, when you come to the last one it doesn't even resemble what the teacher wrote.
[time=2664] Let me give you two illustrations.
[time=2668] No applications of what we can learn from this whole business of patterns and models and examples of the believer.
[time=2678] The first is this, take Jesus Christ as your pattern.
[time=2686] Whatever you do, don't take me.
[time=2690] Don't take your deacon.
[time=2692] Don't take your friend who's been a believer a little bit longer than you.
[time=2694] Take Jesus Christ.
[time=2698] Take him.
[time=2700] And no one else.
[time=2702] John Robinson, the pastor of the pilgrims that came to Plymouth Rock, as he stood in the bow of the boat before they would leave for the new world.
[time=2712] He charged them and he said, "You follow me, but only as you see me follow Jesus Christ because I am convinced that there is more to him than I can ever represent."
[time=2724] Application number one, make sure your eyes are on Christ and no one else and nothing else.
[time=2732] Application number two, having said that, remember this, there'll be people who take their example from you.
[time=2744] I am a poor jogger. I do it out of necessity and not out of love. It falls right behind lima beans.
[time=2754] I run with a friend. He is a much better runner than I am.
[time=2758] And it is all work for me just to make it around that five kilometer track and he wants to hold a conversation.
[time=2766] Usually he ends up in front of me and I'm behind him and I've learned how to keep up.
[time=2770] I force my feet into the footprints that he leaves right in front of me.
[time=2776] And if I do that, that means I'm going to keep my stride going and I'm going to keep my pace up by following his footprints.
[time=2784] There's probably someone who in life today is keeping their stride up because they're following your footprints or mine.
[time=2794] Let's remember that. Let's walk wisely. Let's be an example to each other. Let's not lower the standard.
[time=2806] Personal confession. As a high school student and newly converted to Christ, there was an enthusiasm and determination to walk wisely for Christ.
[time=2816] But as a freshman in college, when I hit a Christian campus and everyone else was a believer, I dropped my standard.
[time=2824] Oh, I didn't do anything that someone could say that was absolutely immoral or wrong.
[time=2830] It wasn't that I went off the deep end. It's just I didn't stay on the peaks either.
[time=2834] I came down to the middle, that middle ground of mediocrity.
[time=2840] And instead of each of us challenging each other for Christ, we began to make each other comfortable with mediocrity.
[time=2848] In the Lord's standards, we aired. We're to be an example to each other of the best we can be. Listen to these words of Longfellow.
[time=2860] Lies of great men all around us. We can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints in the sand of time.
[time=2874] Footprints that perhaps another, sailing over life's solemn mane, a forlorn shipwreck brother, seeing, shall take heart again.
[time=2888] We're to be an example so that if anyone follows in our steps, they will be on a continual upward climb towards the master, towards the Savior.
[time=2902] Paul said, Timothy, don't let anyone push you aside. Instead, win them by being the example of what a believer is to be.
[time=2914] Then he gives them six ways that we'll look at very quickly.
[time=2918] The first he said, be an example in Logos or Logia. That may mean simply our words or it may mean a more formal setting of teaching.
[time=2926] Either way, the application is good. One of the chief ways that we either represent or misrepresent Christ is through what we say and how we speak.
[time=2938] Nine times out of ten when I'm in trouble, it's not my feet. It's my mouth that got me there.
[time=2944] I think that's why Solomon said our words are like a spin arrow. When you're in the heat of battle and you shoot your arrow and you miss,
[time=2954] you don't tiptoe through the enemy's lines to get it back to try again. It's gone.
[time=2960] And so are the words that we speak. There are no strings on them that we can pull them back.
[time=2966] He said, be an example of the believer to the believers in how you hold your tongue in control.
[time=2976] Secondly, he said, be an example of the believer in the King James that says conversation. That was the way they said conduct 400 or 500 years ago.
[time=2984] Today we would put the word conduct or behavior in there. He said, so order your life that you're exemplary in the things that you do and the things that you don't do.
[time=2998] Over the last few years it's been discouraging for me to see standards gradually lowered and lowered.
[time=3008] We have used liberty to the point of abuse in evangelical Christianity.
[time=3014] I hear more people running around saying, I'm free in Christ than I hear saying, I'm a slave to Jesus Christ.
[time=3022] And whatever you do, don't lose sight of either one of them. If you only talk about being a slave to Jesus Christ, then you will err towards legalism.
[time=3032] But if you only can say, I am free in Christ, then you will err towards license.
[time=3038] If the generation of Christians that we are presently a part of have erred, it has been that they have erred in liberty too far.
[time=3046] And we have failed to live our lives exemplary before each other. Maybe that there's no place in the Bible that I or anyone else can point to and say, that is wrong.
[time=3056] It may be what we call a gray area, but in those gray areas somehow the gray has gotten darker and darker and darker over recent years.
[time=3066] And what we always need to do is to move more and more towards the light area, that which is clearly wholesome and honoring to the Lord.
[time=3076] Not only for our own lives, but because we are an example to one another.
[time=3082] All around us there are new Christians who are trying to figure out what's this all about and they're going to take their cues from us.
[time=3088] And there are weaker brothers and sisters who struggle in some areas that we don't struggle in.
[time=3094] So when we are in those areas and may be strong enough to handle them, they say that must be an area where it's safe ground and they go and they're swallowed up.
[time=3102] Our lives need to be totally exemplary.
[time=3106] I want to say anything. I'm going to say, let's raise the standard of conduct.
[time=3110] Let's not apologize, but let's wave it high.
[time=3116] I've enjoyed watching on public service television a series taken from the book of the same title in search of excellence.
[time=3124] I've learned a great deal about there.
[time=3126] I'm not quite sure anymore why we need to apologize if we're maintaining a ministry and we say to people, we want you to maintain these standards.
[time=3134] And someone says, well, where does it say that in the Bible?
[time=3136] I don't know that we have to say it's biblical.
[time=3138] I think we can just say these are good standards that we're going to hold to.
[time=3142] Now, I don't think we ever want to tell somebody it's biblical if it's not. Let me just give you two examples.
[time=3146] Many of you have had the opportunity to do business with IBM.
[time=3152] Have you ever met an IBM salesman or repairman who popped into your office in tennis shoes, worn out blue jeans and a t-shirt that says I love the mountains?
[time=3162] You'll never see it.
[time=3164] They'll look very similar to the professional businessman.
[time=3170] Sharp, clean, and neat.
[time=3174] Let me give you another illustration.
[time=3176] Have you ever gone to one of the major successful companies in America?
[time=3182] They have two outlets, one in Anaheim, California, the other in Buena Vista, Florida.
[time=3186] One's called Disneyland, the other Disney World.
[time=3190] One of the most successful companies in America.
[time=3192] As you walk through those gates, many of you have done that.
[time=3196] Have you ever noticed that there's some guy there taking your tickets that the last time he came close to a razor was three years ago?
[time=3202] Last time he came close to a shower was three days ago?
[time=3206] It won't happen.
[time=3206] Why? Because they work for Mickey Mouse.
[time=3212] And he deserves the best.
[time=3216] That little mouse isn't going to tolerate sloppiness.
[time=3218] That little mouse isn't going to accept lower standards.
[time=3222] That little mouse isn't going to be casual.
[time=3226] Good grief.
[time=3228] That's a cartoon.
[time=3230] Mickey Mouse isn't real in case some of you haven't picked that up yet.
[time=3236] It's simply that they discovered that if they want to do business and they want to do it with excellence, that there are standards they've got to keep.
[time=3246] There are standards beloved that we need to keep.
[time=3256] I want you to come tonight.
[time=3258] Our message is entitled a dress code for a believer.
[time=3260] That's not as bad as it sounds, but I thought that might get some of your attention.
[time=3266] But we are in our conduct to be exemplary so that no one can put a finger on us and say, "Aha! Ha!" Thirdly, we're to be an example in love.
[time=3272] That's our famous Greek word agape.
[time=3274] Let me just give you a quick phrase to describe it.
[time=3276] It is this phrase, unconditional acceptance.
[time=3278] How did God accept you?
[time=3280] He accepted you as you sang just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me.
[time=3288] O Lamb of God, I come to thee, I come.
[time=3290] God accepted us not because of who we are, but He accepted me and you being spite of who we are.
[time=3296] And that's how we're to accept each other.
[time=3298] By this show, all men know that you're my disciples because you maintain the corporate image.
[time=3302] No, that you love one another.
[time=3306] That you reach out to that person who's totally different.
[time=3308] Different background, different system of thought, different culture, different looks, different social economic stress.
[time=3318] We accept you.
[time=3322] Fourthly, in spirit, in this particular context, I believe it means attitude.
[time=3326] All of us have the Holy Spirit.
[time=3328] Just some of us seem to have more of it.
[time=3330] Or under more control of it.
[time=3332] It means attitude.
[time=3334] It means that we are free from negative attitudes like resentment and bitterness and a contrary spirit.
[time=3340] And we're full of attitudes, love, joy, peace, patience, the fruit of the Spirit Galatians 5.
[time=3346] Fifthly, that we're an example of the believer in faith.
[time=3350] That word means faithfulness, our trustworthiness, our dependability, and our loyalty.
[time=3358] One of my favorite things to do is to read T-shirts.
[time=3360] It's an education in itself.
[time=3362] While we're in Colorado, I came across a T-shirt that says exactly what I'm trying not to say.
[time=3368] The T-shirt said, and these were all famous quotes of different people like Mark Twain.
[time=3372] This one came from J.R. Ewing.
[time=3376] It said, "Once you give up integrity, everything else comes easy."
[time=3382] Isn't that true?
[time=3384] If you're willing to give up integrity, everything else will come easy.
[time=3386] He said, "Timothy, be an example of integrity.
[time=3390] Keep the faith.
[time=3390] Be faithful.
[time=3392] Be someone who is loyal and dependable." Sixthly, he said, "Be an example of purity." That means sincerity of motive.
[time=3400] Plato was accused of treason.
[time=3404] One of his students came and he said, "Master, teacher, they have accused you of treason.
[time=3408] What shall we do?" And Plato said, "We shall do nothing.
[time=3414] But live in such a way that every man shall know that it is false.
[time=3418] Let us live in such a way that every man and everyone will know that Jesus Christ is alive
[time=3428] and that he changes lives today.
[time=3430] Let us pray."
