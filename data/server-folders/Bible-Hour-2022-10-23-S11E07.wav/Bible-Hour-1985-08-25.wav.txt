[time=80] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=84] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=90] It's the Bible Hour.
[time=92] With inspiration to music from the sanctuary choir, special groups, and soloists.
[time=97] And a message from God's Word with Pastor Rickoff.
[time=101] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=107] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing] [singing]
[time=133] [MUSIC]
[time=135] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=137] It is a joy for us today to welcome you to our second morning worship service
[time=145] and to also welcome our friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=149] In the last hour, we had an opportunity to lift our hearts together in song, and to give praise to our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to hear from our choir and from Lois and Kevin as they minister to us in song, and then to study the scriptures.
[time=163] And now the privileges ours, as this body assembles together, to listen as our choir leads us in a great anthem, the fact that our God reigns.
[time=172] I don't know what may have come into your life this past week.
[time=176] We receive news that a friend's father had passed away just this morning.
[time=181] We've heard of families that have been in distress, we've heard of accidents, and yet today we still want to proclaim the fact that God is alive, that He cares for you, and that He reigns.
[time=193] And we're praying this morning that He'll reign in your heart.
[time=196] What a joy it was to end the last service with a man coming forward amongst others and said, "I want to receive Christ as Savior." If you've never come to know Christ today, we declare Him to you as our God, and our God reigns.
[time=210] [MUSIC]
[time=214] How lovely on the mountain are the feet of Him,
[time=221] who brings good news, good news.
[time=229] Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
[time=240] our God reigns, our God reigns, our God reigns.
[time=256] Yes, He reigns forever, our God reigns, our God reigns, our God reigns, our God reigns.
[time=275] Yes, He reigns forever, our God reigns, our God reigns.
[time=286] [MUSIC]
[time=291] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say, "Among the nations, high God reigns."
[time=301] [MUSIC]
[time=306] Let the Savior and the Holy Spirit, let them rejoice, and let them say,
[time=312] "Among the nations, high God reigns."
[time=317] [MUSIC]
[time=331] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say,
[time=344] "Among the nations, high God reigns."
[time=351] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say,
[time=363] "Among the nations, high God reigns."
[time=370] Let them be glad, and let them say, "Among the nations, high God reigns."
[time=383] [MUSIC]
[time=407] Let us continue praising our Lord and Savior as we sing together.
[time=412] Him number two, "Come Thou Almighty King." We'll sing the first, third, and fourths, stands us together.
[time=418] Him number two.
[time=426] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=518] We are very grateful for those musicians who have penned words taken from God's word,
[time=524] and then the privilege that we have to sing praises to our God such as we've done this morning.
[time=529] Thank you for your participation.
[time=531] And listen now to Lois Clancy. She sings a song about the mysteries of the Christian being changed
[time=538] and taking on a new body as Christ returns for his own.
[time=543] [MUSIC]
[time=556] In only a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[time=569] At the sound of the trumpet, we will see him come.
[time=581] In only a moment, we'll be holding him in the sky,
[time=591] and the Lord himself will quickly take us home.
[time=603] We shall all be changed, caught up to heaven in a cloud of glory.
[time=612] We shall all be changed, transformed in victory.
[time=621] We shall all be changed, we shall all be changed.
[time=642] [MUSIC]
[time=653] In only a moment, Jesus Christ will call his own,
[time=664] with the voice of the angel and the trump of God.
[time=675] In only a moment, we'll be raised from earth to heaven,
[time=684] where we live in peace forever with our Lord.
[time=696] We shall all be changed, caught up to heaven in a cloud of glory.
[time=705] We shall all be changed, transformed in victory.
[time=714] Death, where is thy sting?
[time=719] God conquered death and hell, we shall all be changed.
[time=734] Death, where is thy sting?
[time=739] God conquered death and hell, we shall all be changed.
[time=749] We shall all be changed.
[time=757] Again, we want to thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=766] Actually, for Pete and myself and the cameramen and technicians, it's pretty early Sunday morning.
[time=772] We come in and record these few moments so we can talk directly to you, and then we play this back while the announcements and offering are going on during the live service.
[time=781] It's important for us to have a chance just to tell you about some things that we want to include you as a part of.
[time=787] And one of those things is the beginning of school here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=791] I think it's Tuesday that your kids start.
[time=794] Yes, this was a great weekend of getting the last-minute gym outfits closed for school, and everybody was excited to understand the malls were very busy.
[time=803] And Tuesday is the beginning, and we'll have a very active hallway in the next coming days.
[time=808] Well, we're looking forward to it.
[time=810] On Thursday, the kindergarteners start, and our daughters heading down to school too.
[time=814] And we are so thrilled about the opportunity that we have for the Kobe and the Hawks children and nearly 300 other students to come here and to learn academic excellence on the Biblical Foundation.
[time=825] That is so important to us that we wanted to share it with you.
[time=829] And if you have not considered Christian education, may I give you my strongest encouragement and recommendation to consider that in these next few days.
[time=838] If you are interested in Black Hawk Christian School, please do not hesitate to call us.
[time=843] Our number is 749-8524.
[time=848] Again, the number is 749-8524.
[time=853] And we'll repeat that number in just a few moments.
[time=856] But we want you to contact us if you're interested in Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=861] Recently, in the last few weeks, we've been telling you about a booklet entitled "Hope" by Charles Swindall.
[time=867] It's an excellent book, isn't it, Pete?
[time=869] I've used it so many times, Rick, in circumstances which I've come in contact with special people.
[time=875] The encouragement that he gives that we have an anchor for the soul, a hope that has steadfast ensures just a reaffirmation of what the scripture says in Hebrews about that anchor that we have in Jesus Christ.
[time=886] You know, Pete, I've discovered that if you have hope, you really have everything.
[time=890] And if you don't have hope, you really don't have a thing.
[time=894] I'm just thinking of a number of people who I visited in hospitals or different situations of stress who didn't have hope.
[time=902] And it just seemed that nothing that was being offered them made any sense.
[time=906] And yet I've met people in the same situation who had hope and it just seemed like everything was going to work out all right.
[time=912] We want to send you this booklet as a gift from us to you.
[time=915] Pete, would you tell our friends how they can receive it?
[time=918] We'd like to encourage you to write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=926] Write for the booklet "Hope".
[time=928] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=935] Thank you, Pete.
[time=936] Next Sunday here in Fort Wayne is Labor Day.
[time=939] Now I say here in Fort Wayne because some of you will see this broadcast two weeks delayed in other places like Marion and South Bend.
[time=946] But on Labor Day Sunday night, we'll be having a special event here, the film The Prodigal.
[time=952] This film is a story about a modern day prodigal child, just like the prodigal son of the Bible.
[time=958] It's the latest of the Billy Graham worldwide picture releases.
[time=962] And we are really privileged to be the first church in this area to premiere the film.
[time=967] It has been in the theaters, but perhaps you missed it.
[time=970] We want to encourage you to join us next Sunday night at 6 o'clock here at the Convocation Center
[time=976] on September the 1st for The Prodigal.
[time=979] I know it'll have a great impact on your life.
[time=981] I have seen it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
[time=984] And it would be an excellent film to invite some friends to who may not be on certain spiritual ground.
[time=990] It would be a great way to expose them to the life-changing power of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=995] We hope that you'll come and will join us.
[time=998] And then September the 8th, two Sundays away, is a very special day for us.
[time=1002] We've had a great year, Rick, and we've decided that on September 8th we were going to use the theme Proclaim His Praise
[time=1008] because God has really been good to Blackhawk financially and spiritually.
[time=1012] We've had new people come to our church, join our church.
[time=1016] We've had people come forward to accept Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=1019] That's what it's all about.
[time=1021] It's going to be a great celebration of worship reflecting on the goodness of God, in particular how good he's been to Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1028] Let this be our encouragement.
[time=1030] If you're the type who are watching the television ministry because you just didn't have enough motivation to get out,
[time=1037] make sure you get out if you're physically able to do that on September the 8th to join us for a service that we've entitled Proclaim His Praise.
[time=1045] We need to return to the life part of our morning worship service and thank you again for joining us.
[time=1051] Again, if you would like information about our Christian school, we encourage you to call us at 749-8524.
[time=1060] Thank you for being with us today.
[time=1067] ♪ He alone, He alone, He alone, He alone, He alone is,
[time=1141] He alone is, He alone,
[time=1151] He alone, He alone, He alone, He alone is,
[time=1171] Soon the day, His return, all beholding Him,
[time=1187] and every King, every King who ever rule, vowing, crying that He alone,
[time=1207] He alone, He alone, He alone, He alone is, He alone, He alone, He alone, Christ alone, He alone is, He alone is,
[time=1255] He alone is, He alone is, Father, we bow before You,
[time=1271] and be before Your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and we declare that He alone is worthy of our love and our praise, and He alone is Lord.
[time=1283] Father, we've come to this worship service as believers in Jesus Christ, to re-declare and to reaffirm our allegiance and our love for Him.
[time=1293] Father, we resubmit ourselves to the Lordship of Jesus Christ in our lives.
[time=1299] Father, we want our lives, our words, the thoughts that we entertain and the secretness of our mind, the very desires of our heart, to please You for Your Son Jesus.
[time=1315] He alone, He alone, His Lord.
[time=1321] And we worship Him today, and we magnify the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1327] We agree and declare with Your Word that His name is above every other name, and we bow before that name today to say that He is God.
[time=1337] Father, we recognize today that we are Your workmanship.
[time=1341] You have created us that we are not ourselves, that we are the sheep of Your pastor.
[time=1347] Father, we've come today as Your servants to declare our allegiance to You.
[time=1355] Father, we want to thank You for all the blessings that we have through faith in Christ.
[time=1361] We want to thank You that we know forgiveness for our sins.
[time=1365] We want to thank You that we know an internal purpose to life.
[time=1369] We thank You that Your Word gives direction as to how we can live out that purpose.
[time=1375] We thank You that Your Spirit gives strength through days of adversity, and we would pray this morning that You would strengthen the hearts of many today.
[time=1387] We pray for the Cox family today.
[time=1390] For Mrs. Cox and Ralph and Rosie, as their loved one, Klais, has gone to be with you.
[time=1397] We thank You for the confidence in our heart that He is with you, and yet we pray for their comfort.
[time=1403] We thank You for bringing George and Mary Lantman back safely from a good trip to the Middle East.
[time=1409] We thank You for the strength You gave Mary to be able to go on that trip.
[time=1413] We pray that You would continue to strengthen her body.
[time=1417] We pray for those who, today, are living with a fractured family.
[time=1423] A son or a daughter is gone.
[time=1425] Or a spouse, a husband, or a wife, as betrayed trust.
[time=1431] They have gone.
[time=1433] Father, for that one who uniquely is walking alone, unfamiliar in their solitude, God, may they find You as their ever-present campaign in the strength of their life.
[time=1445] Father, today, give to each one of us a new and fresh vision for life.
[time=1452] Too often, Father, we, as the Prophet has said, have hewed out cisterns that can hold no water, and we've poured the juices of our life into it, and they've slipped away, and our life has become dry and parched.
[time=1465] Father, put forth Your Spirit to spring forth, and wells of living water.
[time=1471] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1474] [AMEN] One of the most popular children's stories of recent years has been the classic Mary Poppins.
[time=1486] I still enjoy watching that with my children, as Julie Andrews comes floating in on her umbrella and pulls off all kinds of splendid things that I wish happened when I was a little boy.
[time=1497] I remember there was a scene in that when the children were discouraged, and she taught them a very difficult word to say.
[time=1504] You remember it, don't you?
[time=1506] Supercalifragilistic, expialidocious, why even the sound of it is quite atrocious.
[time=1512] Do you remember that word?
[time=1514] You remember, as a little boy would try to stumble those words out of a tongue that just couldn't get 14 syllables to all line up just right, and he couldn't say what appeared to be the most difficult word in the English language.
[time=1529] Supercalifragilistic, expialidocious.
[time=1532] It was a very difficult word to say, and yet it's not the most difficult word to say in the English language.
[time=1541] There are many others that are far more difficult to say.
[time=1545] There are some words that, they don't have quite the 14 syllables, but they're very challenging to say.
[time=1553] I know of none tougher than the simple word, no.
[time=1560] That in the face of temptation, it's far easier to say supercalifragilistic, expialidocious, than it is to greet temptation with that simple monosyllabic word, no.
[time=1576] I don't know anything that's more difficult when the easier path is the wide one that is simply in small letters etched across it, the word compromise.
[time=1588] To turn from that path with a resounding no, I know of no tougher word to say.
[time=1597] I've struggled in my own life to form that little word and to speak it audibly when it needed to be heard.
[time=1605] I've seen many of you struggle, as you've tried to say no even to yourselves.
[time=1613] As we study, profiles encouraged.
[time=1617] John Kennedy writes of a man by the name of Senator Ross.
[time=1622] It's during the days of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, the 17th President of the United States.
[time=1628] The Radical Republicans had lined up the vote, and it would go down to one vote for the necessary two-thirds votes to remove a president from office.
[time=1639] The party whips in the power would come and they would stand before Senator Ross of Kansas.
[time=1647] And they instructed him that it was his duty to vote for impeachment.
[time=1652] It was the party that had put him in office.
[time=1655] It was the party that had given him prominence, and he owed it to the party, and they were calling for loyalty, and the party whips were there.
[time=1667] The votes were taken.
[time=1670] Ross, in his conscience, would vote against impeachment.
[time=1675] But in his political mind, he says, "If I don't vote with the party, I'll never hold public office again." They've assured me of that.
[time=1686] And one of the great chapters of John F. Kennedy's book, Profiles Encourage, the pages of Senator Ross are unfolded.
[time=1692] As a man looks into the face of his peers, who say, "Vote impeachment!" The mouth forms the only word that integrity could bring forth.
[time=1705] No.
[time=1710] I won't compromise integrity to expedite political career.
[time=1717] No.
[time=1720] Those type of sketches are few and altogether too far in between.
[time=1727] When someone looks into the face of opportunity for themselves, but in the name of integrity, says no.
[time=1737] Open your Bible so that we can look at one of these fine, biblical Profiles Encourage, and a rather unknown personality of the Scriptures, a queen by the name of Vashti.
[time=1750] The book is Esther.
[time=1752] You may not be familiar with the book of Esther.
[time=1754] Most of you can find the book of Psalms.
[time=1757] When you find Psalms, make a U-turn.
[time=1759] Go backwards through Job and you'll come to Esther.
[time=1763] And we're going to look at Esther chapter 1 and discover a profile encourage someone who had the ability to say no.
[time=1772] A queen.
[time=1773] Zelda mentioned in the Scriptures almost avoided in history
[time=1779] who stands as a profile encourage someone who refused compromise.
[time=1788] Esther chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=1790] Now it came to pass in the days of Asher Hasteris.
[time=1795] This is Asher Hasteris who reigned from India even under Ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces.
[time=1805] That in those days when the king Asher Hasteris sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in Shushayim the palace.
[time=1813] In the third year of his reign he made a feast under all his princes and his servants, the power of Persia and of media, the nobles and the princes of the provinces bring before him.
[time=1828] When he showed them the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even 104 score days.
[time=1839] This is an introduction not only to a book of the Bible and to a historical setting but into an event that was monumental in history.
[time=1848] Asher Hasteris is a Hebrew name for a man who we know more often by his Greek given name, the name that was given to him by Herodotus, the Greek historian his name was Xerxes, king of the Medo-Persian Empire.
[time=1863] He took the throne somewhere around 485-486 BC.
[time=1869] His reign according to this passage in history confirms that the Bible is right.
[time=1874] To be honest we don't need history to confirm that the Bible is right.
[time=1878] We need the Bible to confirm whether history is being recorded correctly.
[time=1882] But his reign was from India or the Indus River all the way from that eastern boundary going west to the land of Greece and south as far as Ethiopia.
[time=1896] The only place there was left for Xerxes to conquer was the Greek peninsula.
[time=1903] And he would soon do that.
[time=1906] But this man had basically conquered the whole world as he knew it.
[time=1910] He didn't know there was a China here he probably headed there to conquer them.
[time=1915] And he has divided his massive kingdom into 127 provinces.
[time=1923] In these 127 provinces there is either a government that has been set up
[time=1931] by Xerxes himself with someone sent from the Persian Empire to rule over it or there is an indigenous king who has pledged loyalty to Xerxes and pays tribute, supplies military goods and soldiers.
[time=1945] 127 provinces.
[time=1948] Well in his third year 482 BC he decides to have what was the first World's Fair.
[time=1956] That's basically what it was they may have called it Expo 82 for 482 BC.
[time=1962] And for 104 score days that's 180 days
[time=1968] he holds this World's Fair.
[time=1970] He invites everybody to come in and he is simply showing them all of the wealth, all of the splendor and all of the military might of the Medo Persians.
[time=1980] Well there were a couple of reasons to do that.
[time=1982] First of all he was a proud man and he had a lot to show off.
[time=1986] It took 180 days for them to see it all.
[time=1989] But not only that when you see the might of the Persian army marching in front of you
[time=1997] outnumbering the total population of your small province it has a way of fostering loyalty.
[time=2006] Herodotus says this was in preparation for the attack upon the Greek Macedonian peninsula.
[time=2012] And so for 180 days this all takes place in the capital of Susa, or Shishane as the Hebrews called it.
[time=2021] Verse 5 tells us that later on in the 180 days there is a feast, a banquet that was being held and everybody who was a government employee was invited to come.
[time=2035] From the greatest, the princes and the nobles down to the slaves who were scribes or had menial tasks in the government, everyone was invited to this party.
[time=2044] Verse 5 "And when these days were fulfilled the king made a feast unto all the people who were present in Shishane, the palace, both unto the great and the small, seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace.
[time=2059] What they had done is they had taken the king's palace and it had a huge, huge garden.
[time=2066] In the ancient times the king would build extensive, extensive gardens of acres and acres as a way of again showing off their might and their splendor.
[time=2076] You're familiar with the famous hanging gardens of Babylon.
[time=2080] This would be about a hundred years after that time period.
[time=2083] And in these gardens he was holding a banquet for these 127 noblemen from the provinces and all the government employees in Shishane.
[time=2095] It lasted seven days and seven nights.
[time=2098] There was a small combo set up over in the side and Lionel Richie was singing "Let's party forever, fiesta all night long" and for seven days that's exactly what they did.
[time=2108] They called in the interior decorator to do exterior decorating.
[time=2114] Verse six tells us that they took these huge marble columns and they put at the top of those columns some silver rings and they would hang the most beautiful, vogue flowing tapestries of many colors to create the festive atmosphere.
[time=2130] This was to be the event of the ages.
[time=2135] Verse six gives us that beautiful description.
[time=2138] And then verse seven says this.
[time=2140] And they gave them drink in vessels of gold.
[time=2145] The vessels being different one from another and the royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king.
[time=2155] Today we would say they had an open bar.
[time=2158] For seven days and for seven nights the king says there it is, you line them up and won't knock them down.
[time=2166] This is going to be seven nights of it.
[time=2168] It's interesting the Hebrew word "meshah" which means a bank would come from the word "shah" which simply means to drink.
[time=2177] This was a seven-day, seven-night drinking bout.
[time=2181] And for seven days and for seven nights everybody in Shushan was partying.
[time=2188] The Greeks would have known it.
[time=2190] That would have been a good time to attack but they didn't know that.
[time=2194] And so for seven days and for seven nights they're partying.
[time=2198] Verse eight tells us this.
[time=2200] And the drinking was according to law.
[time=2202] None did compel.
[time=2204] What was happening here is if you were from this territory and you drank this particular wine then they had that for you.
[time=2211] And if you were from this particular territory and you drank a different spirit they had that for you and if you were the person who didn't drink no one was forced to drink.
[time=2220] That was their arrangement.
[time=2223] And for seven days and for seven nights the party built and the party built and the party built.
[time=2231] Now off according to verse nine in a completely separate area it says this.
[time=2235] Also Vasti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to the king.
[time=2242] So all the noblemen are over here.
[time=2244] They're having their party and the queen's job is to entertain all the wives.
[time=2248] That's primarily because the men didn't want their wives to know what they were doing.
[time=2252] So they sent them over here to a different convention.
[time=2256] And now the party has gone on.
[time=2259] It has gone long.
[time=2261] For seven days it has come to a climax.
[time=2266] And at the end of this party the seventh day the king decides that he is going to do something highly unusual in history.
[time=2275] And that is he is going to ask the queen to appear.
[time=2282] Verse ten brings us to this moment of climax.
[time=2284] It says on the seventh day the heart of the king was married with wine.
[time=2288] And he commanded seven of his chief men Larry Curlymo and Harley Farley Charlie and Clyde.
[time=2296] And he says to this illustrative group of dignitaries go to the queen's chamber and tell her to come.
[time=2306] Tell her to come with their crown on.
[time=2309] Tell her to come unveiled that they can see her beauty.
[time=2318] A few years back a man by the name of Clarence Edward McCarthy wrote some graphic words to describe this scene.
[time=2327] I couldn't improve upon them so let me read them for you.
[time=2331] Many of the revelers, the partiers, are by this time dead drunk.
[time=2337] Lying on the floor or being carted off on litters by weary slaves.
[time=2342] On a raised platform dancing girls wine their wanton movements
[time=2348] to the accompaniment of strings of sensuous music on the harp and the hall tree while the flute and the cornet play along.
[time=2357] A music now and then that is interrupted by the hiccups are the moddling shouts of drunken revelers.
[time=2366] Sweet incense floods the room with fragrance and pleasing odors.
[time=2372] On the most gorgeous and elevated of couches.
[time=2377] The master of the ceremony, the provider of the feast, the king of the world, Ahasuerus sets.
[time=2389] Ahasuerus ruled the world but not his own spirit.
[time=2396] How unkingly and how uncrowned he now is.
[time=2402] His eyes are bloodshot.
[time=2405] His breasts can track with the hiccup and moddling and drunken and on his knee a half naked Syrian girl.
[time=2415] Through his dull and alcohol-stupefied brain there is the running question.
[time=2422] What more can I do?
[time=2425] What can I do to startle, to entertain these my guests?
[time=2431] Then a gleam comes to his drunken eye.
[time=2435] He has an idea.
[time=2438] The queen.
[time=2440] The beauty of the world to display her before his drunken lord.
[time=2445] That will be something unheard of.
[time=2448] A real climax to a seven-day orgy.
[time=2455] How graphic.
[time=2458] But how truly McCarthy has painted the picture.
[time=2462] For seven days and seven nights the orgy has raged on.
[time=2466] And now a king saying, what can I do to bring this to a climax?
[time=2471] I'll do what it's unthinkable. I'll bring my queen in here.
[time=2474] She's known as the beauty of the world and I will tell her to show her beauty.
[time=2480] In antiquity a woman would not appear before men to show off her beauty.
[time=2486] She would be veiled.
[time=2487] But here what he wanted to do was reduce her to nothing more than an object for sexual display.
[time=2495] And so the seven men are sent from the king's chamber and to tell Vasti to come.
[time=2502] It is a moment of crisis, a moment of decision.
[time=2509] Verse 11 they are told to bring the queen Vasti before the king with their royal crown to show the people and the princes her beauty.
[time=2520] For she was fair to look upon.
[time=2525] Seven men come to a chamber.
[time=2528] They interrupt a rather mild feast in comparison.
[time=2533] This taking part inside the palace with the dignities of royal women.
[time=2539] The queen is instructed by commandment of the king that she is to come.
[time=2544] She is to come to a party that no doubt she can hear the shouts of wildness coming.
[time=2551] She is told and instructed that she is to come and she is to wear the crown.
[time=2555] So everyone will know that this is the queen.
[time=2557] This isn't some girl who's a slave. This isn't one out of many of a harem.
[time=2561] This is the queen.
[time=2564] And she is to come crowned but prepared to display her beauty.
[time=2571] So the crisis, the gauntlet is cast.
[time=2578] Vasti now faces without time to weigh consequences a decision that she must make.
[time=2588] If she says yes, she will do what is expected.
[time=2592] No one is to refuse a command, particularly a command of a king and least of all in those days and pardon the times of woman.
[time=2600] It was expected that she would honor the king's command.
[time=2606] For her to do that would simply mean to break her integrity.
[time=2612] It would simply mean for her to lay her honor aside and become the spectacle for her husband and his drunken friends.
[time=2624] If she honors, everything will be status quo. She will hold down her career as queen.
[time=2630] She will stay in the good graces of the king, so remain in power and prestige and prominence for the rest of her life.
[time=2639] But to say no would, at the very minimum, cause her to be deposed, reduced in likelihood to a slave and if not a slave then be put to death.
[time=2654] And suddenly she's confronted. A small price to pay, a little honor, a little virtue for your life, for your life as a queen.
[time=2667] A small price to pay, but it was too big a price for her.
[time=2673] Verse 12 says this, that she took her lips and she formed them to say the most difficult word in any language. No.
[time=2686] No. And she looked into the face of seven men sent to taker and she said no, I won't go.
[time=2696] Verse 12, but the queen Vesti refused to come to the king's command by his chamberlands. Therefore was the king enraged and he burned with anger.
[time=2710] This is a rare, rare profile in courage. When we have the privilege of meeting someone who is willing to maintain integrity by saying no in the face of compromise.
[time=2729] If there's a message for us, it is basic, it is simple. That we, like she, must learn, as she said, to look into the face of compromise and to know that its cost is enormous.
[time=2755] And say no. And to say no.
[time=2760] In doing some research I came across a man who said I made my children every night at dinner time, say no ten times, just so it would come to their lips easily.
[time=2770] That's not a bad idea.
[time=2773] Why is it that when we instruct our kids when they're ages six months to twenty four months to do something that the only word they can speak is no.
[time=2785] And when they're thirteen they can never say it.
[time=2789] No.
[time=2791] You know there are a number of times in the Bible where someone faced the same type of temptation and they should have said no.
[time=2800] And they said yes.
[time=2802] Go back all the way to the pages of history begin to grow old and brittle as you turn them back.
[time=2811] You come to the beginning of time and the first person who ever faced temptation was Eve.
[time=2816] And the serpent speaking for Satan said look at this, take it, it's yours, just say yes.
[time=2826] And she should have said no. And no doubt the spirit within her was crying out saying say no, say no.
[time=2838] But she compromised and said yes and sin penetrated the human race.
[time=2845] And quickly on her heels the same temptation was given to her husband Adam and that same spirit inside him would say say no.
[time=2855] He would say yes.
[time=2862] David would look from his palace six hundred years before Xerxes.
[time=2869] And he would walk to the edge of his palace and he would overlook his garden and then by chance his eyes would glaze a little further.
[time=2877] And in his gaze he would see what was not his to see.
[time=2882] His eyes would behold Bathsheba bathing.
[time=2886] And his mind would begin to say say no.
[time=2893] He said yes.
[time=2898] And it cost him his testimony, his integrity, his family, his right to build a temple for his God because he didn't say no.
[time=2920] A generation later a son by the name of Absalom would look and rage would fill his heart against a half-brother Ammon.
[time=2931] There would come within him two voices one that would say avenge strike back.
[time=2944] One would say say no to anger say no.
[time=2951] And he said yes. His fire of the heart was kindled with a hot flame and his rage burnt and he killed his half-brother and he became an insurrection against his father and he died in shame because he couldn't say no.
[time=2970] And yet the Bible in a very refreshing way gives us some examples of men who did like Vashti have the courage to say no.
[time=2983] I think of Moses who was raised as though he was Pharaoh's grandson.
[time=2989] He was reared in Egyptian by his stepmother the princess of Egypt and all that Egypt had to offer him was there but he also had a nursemaid who was actually his natural mother who continually whispered in his adolescent ear.
[time=3005] You're not an Egyptian, you're a Hebrew. There came a moment of decision and of crisis in his life as well and in that moment he had to choose will I be an Egyptian?
[time=3017] Will I inherit all that Egypt has to offer or will I identify with an enslaved people?
[time=3025] All he had to do was say yes to Pharaoh. But in the startling refreshing contrast to the others we've mentioned Moses said no.
[time=3038] Hebrews 11 records these words about verse 24 and 25 that Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a cease.
[time=3051] When they offered it to him he unusually uncharacteristic of the rest of us said no, no.
[time=3062] But there's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ who stands as exemplary of one who would say no.
[time=3068] Three times Satan would tempt him. He would take him to a high mountain after 40 days and 40 nights of going without food.
[time=3075] The Bible makes the greatest understatement of history when it said Jesus was hungry.
[time=3081] And Satan simply said just do this say yes turn the stones in the bread just just say yes stones do it.
[time=3091] They could look into the face of temptation and say no. And to say it three times no no no.
[time=3106] Beloved we must learn to say no if our character is to survive the times in which we live.
[time=3114] We must learn to say no to a variety of temptations that will face us.
[time=3121] We have to say no to that business deal that offers big returns for a small investment.
[time=3129] Just a little compromise it's no big deal. You really don't even have to do anything just don't make any waves just go along with it.
[time=3138] Let it slide this time. Just a little compromise it'll pay big big investments say no.
[time=3152] Young person say no to that carload of teenagers who said hey Herbie's parents are out of town the party's there tonight let's go.
[time=3166] Say no.
[time=3171] Say no to your boss when he expects you to say yes to him every time when he knows that saying yes to him means you're saying no to your wife no to your son no to your daughter and no to your God.
[time=3186] And he wants you to say yes learn to say no learn to say no to your date who thinks that life's a big smart sport and expects you to be dessert say no say no.
[time=3209] When that fire within your own heart says I remember I remember what you said oh and I remember how it hurt and there comes a spirit within you that wants to strike back say no say no.
[time=3230] When you're with a group of weaker Christians who've discovered their liberty but in the words of the apostle Paul they're using liberty as an occasion to the flesh.
[time=3241] And they're saying oh come on we're doing it it's all right.
[time=3248] Say no say no.
[time=3255] Say Rick that's easy for you to say.
[time=3258] Matter of fact it's so easy for you to say we pay you to say that kind of thing.
[time=3263] But Rick if you had my job you don't understand something.
[time=3266] If I said no to my boss I'd lose that next promotion.
[time=3272] Others would say if I said no to my boss I would lose the promotion I'd lose the job.
[time=3278] Bestie lost a crown.
[time=3281] We don't know the story of history it's not totally included but she may have lost her life.
[time=3289] Say no.
[time=3291] But you know there are times that saying no when the spirit so directs that we find something strange and peculiar.
[time=3301] We may find not rejection but acceptance.
[time=3307] Friend and I struggled together on more than one breakfast early in the morning before he had to work with a job.
[time=3315] A job that demanded compromise in areas of integrity.
[time=3319] It demanded that he play a role that he wasn't willing to pay.
[time=3324] He wrestled with it.
[time=3326] Finally he simply went to the owner of the company sat down and in a gracious win some way underlined that.
[time=3333] Would you gracious and win some way.
[time=3335] He simply explained his own convictions and the discrepancy that he was being pressured into.
[time=3341] The owner simply said I'm not quite sure I understand all that you're saying but you're doing a good job.
[time=3346] But that's how you feel you do it your way and we'll be happy.
[time=3350] But some of us have just put on the same outfit every Monday morning.
[time=3355] We just learned to say yes.
[time=3358] We become yes men.
[time=3362] We said yes consistently when we should have said no.
[time=3367] But you know the great paradox of life is this.
[time=3371] That many of us who have walked through life Monday through Saturday saying yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[time=3379] Find the courage on Sunday morning to say no when God knocks on the door of our heart.
[time=3385] What a paradox.
[time=3387] We've fallen trapped to the very words of Jesus when he said who's to ever will save his life?
[time=3392] Yes, yes, yes, we'll lose it.
[time=3396] But who's to ever will lose his life?
[time=3398] We'll find it.
[time=3403] Queen Vesti, a true profile and courage.
[time=3408] Someone who had the rare ability to look at temptation in the face knowing the excessive cost and said the most difficult word in any language.
[time=3422] No.
[time=3426] May God help each of us to say it daily.
[time=3431] For God and our fathers we bow before you in prayer.
[time=3435] We recognize that you are king, that you are the one to whom we owe every yes and to whom we owe every no.
[time=3445] Thank you for a queen who would stand before a watching world and say that integrity and honor are worth more than a crown in the kingdom.
[time=3456] Father, may we live for a crown that you will place upon our heads.
[time=3460] And may we serve in a kingdom of which your son Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=3466] Father, give to those of us who know Christ is Savior, the ability to say no.
