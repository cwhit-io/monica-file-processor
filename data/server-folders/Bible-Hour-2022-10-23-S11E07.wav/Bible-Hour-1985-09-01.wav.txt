[time=100] (upbeat music)
[time=119] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=198] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=205] We welcome you to our second morning worship service here today at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=212] We're delighted that you've come to worship with us to lift up our voices and to say that God, we belong to you.
[time=220] You are a great God and you're worthy of our praise and we are your servants.
[time=224] I hope that's the spirit in which you've come today.
[time=227] We welcome you and are so thankful you're here to worship with us.
[time=230] And we also want to say a word of welcome to our friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=235] Thank you for the privilege that is ours, both here in this place and through television to declare our love and our allegiance for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=244] We are his servants, we belong to him.
[time=247] Our choir is going to sing a number of songs that are put together that give us this theme, first that we are servants of the Lord.
[time=255] And then ultimately to know that they'll come a time when our labor will be satisfied.
[time=260] And all the earth will clap their hands and shout for joy because the Lord is king.
[time=266] [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=373] (birds chirping) [MUSIC - 474 seconds]
[time=858] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=860] Again, we appreciate it when you sing hardly those praises to the Lord.
[time=864] We'll continue in music now as we listen to Susan Toyrach.
[time=867] She's gonna minister to us as a vocal soloist, singing like a lamb who needs a shepherd.
[time=884] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=1039] Hello again. We have broken away from the Morning Worship Service so that Pete and I could share some special words of interest to you.
[time=1048] Next Sunday, September the 8th is a very special day as we look forward to a Sunday of praise.
[time=1054] Yes, Rick, we've been planning for quite a time now and we've titled our program for next week.
[time=1059] Proclaim his praise. We'll have special musical guest Keith and star Bratigan.
[time=1064] Keith is now getting his doctorate at IU but we'll be coming back to Fort Wayne for our special event next Sunday.
[time=1071] Well, I'm certainly looking forward to their ministry here with us.
[time=1074] Keith and star have been a part of our church historically, have such a tremendous gift of music.
[time=1080] But each of us have a gift and that is the ability to worship and to give praise to God.
[time=1084] That's a very special Sunday so I hope you'll make a very special effort to be here with us.
[time=1089] In addition to that, I want to invite you to join us here tonight, September the 1st, for a special film.
[time=1095] Each Labor Day weekend we do our best to have a special event on the Sunday night of that weekend.
[time=1101] And tonight we have the film The Prodigal. It's the most recent of the Billy Graham films.
[time=1106] It's an excellent film talking about the Prodigal Son in a modern day situation.
[time=1112] We'd love to have you come and join us tonight at six o'clock as we have an opportunity to show this film.
[time=1118] It has been out in the theaters, but I believe we'll be the first church in Fort Wayne to be able to share it with this community.
[time=1123] So we hope that you'll come and join us tonight at six o'clock.
[time=1127] Pete, we have timeless insights for our friends as well.
[time=1130] I know that's something that you appreciate.
[time=1132] A lot of our writers write in and express how important the timeless insights is into their daily life
[time=1138] and to the inspiration that they receive on a day-to-day basis because it is that type of devotional
[time=1144] that can be used every day and is a systematic approach to going through the Bible in a particular year.
[time=1150] You know, timeless insights has been something that I have appreciated time and time again.
[time=1155] I don't use that as a play on word with the name timeless insights, but it does help you to study the Bible consistently.
[time=1162] Many, many times I meet new Christians who are saying, "My life just really hasn't grown much."
[time=1168] And I usually ask the question, "How consistent are you in studying God's Word?" And usually that's the end of the discussion because we've put our finger on their pulse and we've found that the pulse beat is very low.
[time=1180] Your growth is going to be proportional to the time and the quality of the time that you spend in God's Word.
[time=1187] I know of no better way to systematically study the Word than the use of timeless insights.
[time=1193] And we're offering it to you free this month because October 1st begins a new year as we go back to the Book of Matthew
[time=1201] and start with Matthew and move straight through the New Testament in 12 months.
[time=1205] So we want you to write today so that we can have time to send you a copy by October 1st of timeless insights.
[time=1212] Write to us today at the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1219] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1223] Once again, that's the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1229] 46815.
[time=1232] On this Labor Day weekend, I hope you'll take a few moments to set aside the time to write to us.
[time=1238] You may be writing to ask for timeless insights. I hope that you do.
[time=1242] But we'd love to hear from you. And when you do write to us, please include the call letters of the station that you're watching.
[time=1248] If it's here in Fort Wayne or if it's in South Bend or in Marion, we'd love to know where you're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1255] We'd love to hear from you. Any words of suggestion or encouragement we'd be glad to receive along with your request for timeless insights.
[time=1263] Pete, as we go back to the Morning Worship Service, what do we have to look forward to in the way of music?
[time=1267] Rick, we're going to enjoy the ministry of Kathy Hawks, your wife and Susan Toyrac singing just a beautiful song with a poignant message entitled, "I've Just Seen Jesus."
[time=1277] It will bless the hearts of our people watching.
[time=1280] Well, I'm looking forward to that. I know that Kathy loves to sing and that she loves the Lord and she has no greater joy than to be a part of the ministry of music here.
[time=1288] And I want to express my thankfulness to you for the fine job you do in preparing our choir and all of our musicians.
[time=1294] Thank you, Rick.
[time=1295] As we go back to our Morning Worship Service, we're going to be looking at the book of Second Chronicles in the 26th chapter.
[time=1301] And there we'll meet a biblical figure, a king by the name of Josiah.
[time=1306] It's good for us to look at a man who prospered on this Labor Day and to learn from his prosperity, some words of warning.
[time=1313] I hope you'll stay with us. May God bless you.
[time=1323] We knew he was dead. It is finished, he said. And we watched as his life ebbed away.
[time=1338] And then we all stood around till the guards took him down. Joseph begged for his body that day.
[time=1354] It was late afternoon when we got to the tomb, wrapped his body, sealed up the grave.
[time=1368] So I know how you feel. His death was so real. But please listen and hear what I say.
[time=1385] I've just seen Jesus. I tell you he's alive. I've just seen Jesus, our precious Lord alive.
[time=1414] And I knew he really saw me too, as if to now.
[time=1433] I never leave. All that I've done before won't matter anymore.
[time=1454] I've just seen Jesus. And I'll never be the same again.
[time=1482] It was his voice she first heard those kind gentle words.
[time=1490] Press me twice. Was the reason for tears. And I sobbed in despair. My Lord is not there.
[time=1504] He's a child. It is I. I am here.
[time=1513] I've just seen Jesus. I tell you he's alive.
[time=1531] I've just seen Jesus. Our precious Lord alive.
[time=1545] And I knew he really saw me too. He really saw me too, as if to now.
[time=1564] I never leave. All that I've done before won't matter anymore.
[time=1585] I've just seen Jesus. I've just seen Jesus.
[time=1598] I've just seen Jesus. And all I ever done before won't matter anymore.
[time=1619] I've just seen Jesus. And I'll never be the same again.
[time=1635] I've just seen Jesus.
[time=1664] You may not be familiar with a church like this. Maybe you're from a different town and you're visiting a friend.
[time=1673] And they brought you here this morning not against your will but it wasn't your vote either.
[time=1678] Maybe you're watching from a hospital room by way of television trying to say, what are those people all about?
[time=1687] Why do they do what they do? I do they assemble on a morning like this.
[time=1693] Beautiful day for a family picnic or a golf. Golf would be nice. Why do they meet today?
[time=1701] See we meet because we believe that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1707] And all that we have ever done before it really doesn't matter anymore.
[time=1714] It's not just a poetic expression but it's a reality of life that Jesus Christ can come into a person's life
[time=1721] and they can give them a new sense of purpose and a new sense of direction in life.
[time=1726] You say you mean you don't golf or go on family picnics? Oh, we're better golfers. Not on score. Not on score.
[time=1735] But in our hearts there's a new purpose to life. Our purpose is to serve the resurrected Christ.
[time=1742] And although we didn't have the privilege as did Mary and a few other select men and women 2,000 years ago
[time=1750] to stroll through a sandy street in Jerusalem and to cite before eyes an empty tomb
[time=1758] and to be able to say that we've just seen Jesus today with our eyes we have seen.
[time=1768] With the fingers of faith we have felt and we declare unto you that we have seen Jesus and He is alive.
[time=1780] God we come to worship you today through your Son, our living Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=1789] And Father we magnify His name and we declare with your word that His name is above every name
[time=1799] and that every knee should bow and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=1807] God we declare it today and we bow before you to say that your Son Jesus Christ is our Lord.
[time=1816] And we believe He is alive. We believe Father the testimony of your word in Scripture.
[time=1823] Father we believe the witness of your spirit in our hearts that He is alive.
[time=1830] Father is we hunger as a nation, as we search as a generation for that which would give purpose to life.
[time=1838] Father we are thankful that Jesus Christ is the answer. God make of us witnesses of clarity.
[time=1846] May our integrity so reflect your Son that there is a watching world who does say
[time=1852] we've just seen Jesus. God may they see Him in our lives. Put that power in our hearts.
[time=1858] Father today may the vision of Christ that is within us give strength to that heart that is weary today.
[time=1867] For that one that wrestles with the tragic loss of a loved one. God be of comfort to them.
[time=1877] May their vision of Christ give to them a peace that surpasses understanding.
[time=1884] Father today we pray that the knowledge of Christ in the hearts of those who've suffered rejection
[time=1893] would give to them a sense of divine acceptance.
[time=1897] We pray for that one whose marriage has been torn apart by infidelity in a more violent way than any war could.
[time=1906] We pray for that parent whose hearts is in an innumerable number of pieces
[time=1912] because of the rejection in the rebellion of a teenager.
[time=1917] God today may their vision of Jesus give to them an energy to keep going when their natural systems want to shut down.
[time=1929] God we pray for those who loneliness is their only companion.
[time=1934] That they might have a vision of Christ and that they might be able to say I've just seen Jesus and He walks with me
[time=1940] and He talks with me and He tells me that I am His own.
[time=1947] Father as we go through life we've got blind spots and we often don't see all that you have.
[time=1955] All that you want us to know but Father we have seen Jesus Christ and He is alive and we worship Him today.
[time=1963] For it's in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1970] Every one of us has had an experience that is disappointing.
[time=1975] We've had expectations and we thought that expectation was about to be fulfilled but disappointment has gripped us.
[time=1984] Something was different at the end.
[time=1989] Remember waiting through a long line at a wedding reception. I'm a professional wedding goer.
[time=1994] That's one of my privileges.
[time=1998] As a professional wedding goer you tend to take advantage of wedding receptions and we waited through a long line.
[time=2006] The food looked good. They had these little meatballs wrapped in bacon.
[time=2011] I loved little meatballs wrapped in bacon and I loaded up on little meatballs wrapped in bacon.
[time=2019] There's a certain number that you can take that is socially acceptable and I was pushing that limit.
[time=2026] I took my plate of little meatballs wrapped in bacon and took my first bite.
[time=2034] Have you ever had liver wrapped in onions?
[time=2040] Something was different when I came to the end of the line.
[time=2045] We went mountain climbing in Teton National Park.
[time=2049] Discovered how a particular mountain got its name.
[time=2053] You stand and you're looking at the south end of the Grand Teton.
[time=2057] Beautiful majestic mountain. You stand at the base of that mountain and you walk and you climb.
[time=2064] You pull yourself on ropes and you belay to the top.
[time=2068] You discover something.
[time=2071] A mountain you're on has a unique name. It is called Mount Disappointment.
[time=2077] Because you have not climbed the Grand Teton.
[time=2080] You have climbed a mountain that stands right in the face of it and in the rock formations it looks like
[time=2086] it's part of the Grand and you're on your way to the top.
[time=2091] It's very disappointing.
[time=2096] There are things in life that we work for and we labor for.
[time=2100] And when we bite into the expected fruit of it all, it's liver and onions.
[time=2109] It's the wrong mountain. Prosperity is a strange thing.
[time=2116] Some of you have already tasted of prosperity's fruit and some of it's been sweet.
[time=2121] But for some of you it's just been the bacon on the outside and you've been a little deeper and you say there's some liver in prosperity.
[time=2133] This summer we've looked at character studies and I want to invite you to open your Bible with us to second chronicles as we look at a final character study. A king by the name of Josiah that discovered prosperity had a disappointing core.
[time=2148] Its center was not so sweet.
[time=2151] Second chronicles chapter 26.
[time=2156] Chronicles receives its names because like the word sounds it is a keeping of the time.
[time=2163] It was a keeping of the actual records, the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel.
[time=2169] Chapter 26 introduces to us a new character in the flow of this book by the name of Josiah, also known as Azariah.
[time=2180] Chapter 1 or chapter 26 verse 1.
[time=2185] Then all the people of Judah took Josiah who was 16 years old and made him king in the stead of his father Amaziah.
[time=2195] And he built Eloth and restored it to Judah after the king slept with his fathers.
[time=2202] 16 years old was Josiah when he began to reign and he reigned 50 and 2 years in Jerusalem.
[time=2210] His mother's name was Jekylliah of Jerusalem.
[time=2215] By way of background we're introduced to this man by the name of Josiah.
[time=2219] Josiah's father was king over Judah.
[time=2223] Allow me just to trace a little recent history for you contemporaneous to this affair.
[time=2230] Israel was established as a kingdom under a man by the name of Saul.
[time=2235] Many of you will remember that Saul was replaced by the far more popular and more likable David.
[time=2242] David reigned as king and was followed by his son Solomon, a man gifted by God with extraordinary wisdom.
[time=2252] But unfortunately Solomon was followed by his son, Rehoboam, who apparently to get extra wisdom for Solomon, God took it from Rehoboam because he lacked the most common of senses.
[time=2264] And Rehoboam through his own bad instincts and collecting even worse advice went through a tragic civil war,
[time=2273] not altogether different than ours, but the outcome was.
[time=2278] Instead of a nation going through a civil war and being united, this was a nation that went through a civil war and was divided.
[time=2286] Ten kings in the north would form into a nation that is now called Israel.
[time=2295] Two kingdoms are tribes, if you will, to the south.
[time=2298] We may call them states today, form a new kingdom of Judah.
[time=2304] And so for several hundred years a nation would be divided between itself, Israel and Judah.
[time=2315] Of the two histories Judah is the better but certainly not enviable.
[time=2320] It is a one that is marked by a few slight peaks of spiritual recovery followed by greater depths of decline and decay.
[time=2330] But a high point in all this was the reign of a king by the name of Uzziah.
[time=2335] His name means God, Jehovah, Yahweh is my strength.
[time=2343] He follows his father, a man by the name of Uzziah, who in the nation times was a good king better than most, but less than ideal.
[time=2355] His father is described in 2 Kings 14 verse 2 as a "fence writer,"
[time=2361] a man who was prone to compromise and vacillation.
[time=2366] Uzziah did follow the Lord and he did bring about to some degree a spiritual revival, but he was not willing to rid the nation of the temples, the high places they're called simply because they went to a high place.
[time=2379] And on top of that high place built a higher building, and so they called it a high place.
[time=2383] It was a creative name that they came up with.
[time=2386] It was just a place of pagan worship.
[time=2388] And there would be the expectation that in revival these places would be eliminated.
[time=2393] Like Gideon, who went right into his hometown, tore down the statues, burnt the poles to Asheroth, eliminated the towers, the altars, and the whole fabric of pagan worship.
[time=2406] Uzziah did not do that.
[time=2408] He brought about revival, but not cleansing.
[time=2411] And as his years went on his reign began to become one of consistent blundering.
[time=2418] To the point where his final blunder allowed for the sister but enemy, Israel, to smash down the walls of Jerusalem.
[time=2427] Because of poor judgments that were consistent in his reign, he put himself into self-imposed exile in a city called Laikish.
[time=2437] But the fear and the angry of his contemporaries was not going to be held back simply by a self-imposed exile.
[time=2447] And so on what we would call today a coup d'état, a group of men, would leave at night from Jerusalem and go to Laikish.
[time=2456] And there they would have their plot come to assassination.
[time=2461] And Uzziah is killed.
[time=2464] There's now a vacancy.
[time=2467] And surprisingly enough they elect his son King.
[time=2471] As a matter of fact, according to verse 1, it says, "Then all the people of Judah." It was a unanimous vote. He was placed in his king at 16 years of age, one of the youngest kings.
[time=2480] And he ruled for 52 years one of the longest reigns.
[time=2485] An extraordinary man, blessed with extraordinary success.
[time=2490] Between verses 4 and 15, it gives to us his reign of successes.
[time=2497] Allow me to give you some of the highlights.
[time=2500] In verse 6 it tells us this, "That he, Uzziah, sent forth and warred against the Philistines and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jevna and the wall of Ashdoth.
[time=2513] And he built cities around Ashdod among the Philistines." Now the Philistines were the proverbial enemy of the Israelites.
[time=2526] These people had constantly attacked from the borders and would extend their perimeter into the lands that Israel occupied.
[time=2535] And even during the days of David they were never completely subdued or eliminated.
[time=2541] They had three principal fortress cities that bordered upon Judah, Gath, Jevna and Ashdoth.
[time=2550] You may say, "That sounds familiar. That's the hometown of a little fella by the name of Goliath."
[time=2556] A small nine foot nine inch problem in the history of Israel.
[time=2561] And out of that city, Goliath was probably just one of many large men.
[time=2567] Nine foot nine inches tall is large.
[time=2570] You picture these NBA players, NBA players like Patrick Ewing, who are seven foot, seven foot four in Ralph Sampson's case.
[time=2579] Giants of men, this man was two foot six inches taller than the biggest of them.
[time=2587] You've seen those NBA players take basketballs and palm them like this.
[time=2590] Goliath took basketball players and palm them like this.
[time=2593] He was an extraordinary sight.
[time=2596] And out of Gath, with just waves of intimidation, would come across the land of Israel.
[time=2601] And no one had ever been able to subdue them.
[time=2605] Here comes the 16-year-old king, marches up, puts together a military plan in the early days of his reign.
[time=2612] And he attacks and it says he broke the wall.
[time=2616] That's an expression to say he destroyed their defenses.
[time=2620] He reduced them to his vassals.
[time=2625] Some of that had to be a frustration.
[time=2627] Don't you hate it when the new young guys walk into the company?
[time=2630] And they don't even know what they're doing and they fall into the biggest commission you've ever seen.
[time=2634] That happened to this young man.
[time=2637] He became king and instantly he has subdued the ancient dominant enemy, the Philistines.
[time=2642] And then the next verse it says, "And out of the Amorites, another proverbial antagonist, he's got them paying tribute to him."
[time=2651] Now that works as a wonderful cycle.
[time=2654] Because what he does is he conquers an enemy, then forces that enemy to pay taxes or tribute.
[time=2659] He takes their money and turns it into further armaments to fight them.
[time=2664] When you love it if you'd have got up this morning and says, "Pravda has just announced that the Soviet Union has agreed to pay X number of billions of dollars to finance Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program."
[time=2679] Don't wait for that to happen.
[time=2681] But that's basically what he had done.
[time=2683] He had taken them and he had forced them to pay tribute and then he simply turned that into an immense army.
[time=2691] Later on in this chapter it tells us that he had a standing army, not a call-up system, not reserved, not draftable men, but a standing army of 300 men who were tremendously well-equipped with every strategic advantage that they could have.
[time=2711] He was somewhat of an inventor.
[time=2713] In the King James in verse 15 it says, "He made in Jerusalem engines." He wasn't quite that sophisticated of an engineer.
[time=2722] They didn't have gasoline engines.
[time=2724] That would have been a significant military advantage if he would have rolled in there with an engine driven tank.
[time=2730] That wasn't quite it.
[time=2731] It simply means that which is engineered, built together, he built towers.
[time=2737] And perhaps this was the first time these were used in Middle East history.
[time=2740] Large towers that were shielded and these towers were mobile and he could wheel them into battle so that as his army was marching on the other army they could stand on top of these mobile towers with their archers and simply shoot over the lines.
[time=2755] And they would be slaying their enemy before the enemy was close enough to retaliate.
[time=2761] Militarily, this man was an enormous success.
[time=2766] And because he was so successful militarily, that brought security to the land so the Department of Internal Affairs was flourishing.
[time=2775] Israel has a wet and a dry season.
[time=2778] Because the dry season is so dry and the wet season is so short, the land in many of the places would be totally worthless for any type of agriculture,
[time=2789] be it basic farming of crops or the maintaining of livestock.
[time=2794] What this man did is he actually engineered huge cisterns so that when the wet seasons came, there would be a way of capturing the volume of water and retaining it for the purposes of agriculture.
[time=2807] And in verse 10 it tells us that from the lowlands to the mountains, the land was productive.
[time=2816] He was a tremendous success story militarily and domestically.
[time=2825] So much so that it tells us that his fame was spread abroad even to Egypt.
[time=2833] Now when they're talking about you in Egypt, you're really something special.
[time=2838] That's how you know you've arrived.
[time=2841] When they start putting your corporate name on the big board in New York, you've arrived.
[time=2849] His name was renowned everywhere. He was a tremendous success story.
[time=2856] What was the secret of all that? Well the secret's given to us in verse 15.
[time=2863] And his name was spread abroad for he was marvelously helped.
[time=2871] He was marvelously helped.
[time=2875] There's another hint of that even previous to this in verses 4 and 5 it says, "And he did that which was right on the side of the Lord according to all that his father Amaziah did.
[time=2887] He sought the Lord in the days of Zechariah who had understanding and the visions of God.
[time=2892] And as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper."
[time=2899] This young king who had a lengthy reign of 52 years prospered not simply because of good decisions or good counsel,
[time=2909] but because God prospered him. He was marvelously helped.
[time=2914] But yet there's a phrase of contingency in there.
[time=2917] Did you notice that? That little phrase of contingency.
[time=2920] It says this, "As long as he sought the Lord, then God made him prosper."
[time=2931] Here was a man who tasted a prosperity and it was given to him of the Lord.
[time=2938] But he came to a crisis, a turning point that is presented in verse 16.
[time=2946] But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction.
[time=2956] For he transgressed against the Lord is God and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
[time=2966] And as a riot the priest went in after him and with him four score priests of the Lord who were valiant men.
[time=2978] And they withstood, Uzziah the king, and said unto him, "It appertained if not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord,
[time=2991] but to the priest, the son of Aaron who are consecrated to burn incense.
[time=2996] Go out of the sanctuary, for thou hast trust passed, neither shall it be for thine honor from the Lord God."
[time=3007] Then Uzziah was angry and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense.
[time=3015] And while he was angry with the priest, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priest in the house of the Lord.
[time=3027] And from beside the incense altar.
[time=3031] He was a man who was on a roll. He was prospering in every way.
[time=3039] He was renowned and he was famous.
[time=3043] But inside prosperity there was a danger point.
[time=3048] There was something inside of prosperity that was more bitter than liver will ever be.
[time=3059] It says when he was strong, when he was prospers, when he had arrived, his heart was lifted up. That's pride.
[time=3068] And he thought he could elevate himself and where did he think he was going to lead him to?
[time=3073] Greater fame, greater riches, greater successes, and where he brought himself up to his destruction.
[time=3081] There's a paradoxical statement of Jesus that if I can paraphrase it, it's simply this. The quickest way up is down.
[time=3090] And the quickest way down is up.
[time=3095] You see Jesus said, "Whosoever will exalt himself shall be made low, but whosoever shall humble himself before me, him will I exalt."
[time=3106] The paradoxical, but the quickest way up is down. You want God to lift you up, humble yourself in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
[time=3116] If you don't want to be put down, then don't lift yourself up because God will take the high and exalt it in the mighty and he will bring them to not.
[time=3129] Pride prosperity is a seed that is far more bitter than anything will taste. That is pride. Pride. It's so dangerous.
[time=3143] His pride led him to independence when he thought he didn't need anybody else. He was on top of the world. He was accountable to no one.
[time=3150] He had his own system going. He had his own business. He had his own money. He was autonomous. He didn't need anyone else.
[time=3156] And he pushed the priest aside and said, "I'll take care of that." But God said, "No, you won't." He said, "Oh, yes, I will."
[time=3163] And God struck him with leprosy. The remaining verses tell us that he was deposed, no leper could be king, and that he died in that condition.
[time=3176] A long way up for a quick trip down. There are some practical lessons for us to learn along the way. Allow me to share them with you.
[time=3187] The first one isn't quite so obvious. I find it in verses 4 and 5. It tells us that he did just what his dad did.
[time=3199] And that all the days of Zechariah, the man who had the vision from the Lord, he followed the Lord.
[time=3208] Here's the principal I want to share with you. It is essential that we personalize our faith.
[time=3215] Here was a man who tried to borrow his faith from his father who had too little despair and who tried to lean on Zechariah who died.
[time=3228] And suddenly found himself fatherless and profitless and his own spiritual convictions weren't enough to sustain him.
[time=3237] Every one of us has to go through a process of personalizing our values.
[time=3241] It's not enough that your family have made a commitment to Christ. It's not enough that you go to a Christian university.
[time=3248] It is not enough that you come to church. You cannot plug your umbilical cord into the rest of us and suck your spiritual life away from someone else.
[time=3257] It's got to be your own. Because they'll come at time when your prophets die and your fathers are gone and it will be you in the heat of the battle.
[time=3268] What's in you is what will make the difference.
[time=3273] The commitment to Christ has got to be yours.
[time=3278] I love you. It's my privilege to serve you as one of your pastors.
[time=3284] But you can't run off my energy. It's barely enough for me. I can't carry you.
[time=3293] Where's your commitment? It's got to be your own.
[time=3299] Tried to run off of a borrowed relationship with God.
[time=3304] A second practical lesson that is far more obvious is this.
[time=3308] Prosperity has within it the inherent danger of pride.
[time=3314] The book of Deuteronomy, Israel, was worn consistently when you've gotten into the land and when you own the land and when your livestock begins to multiply and your gold and silver begin to accumulate
[time=3327] and you've eaten of the goodness of the land and you're satisfied, beware, beware lest you forget the Lord thy God and thy say in thine heart.
[time=3339] My might and my strength has gotten me all of this.
[time=3347] I wouldn't say that. No, you just would say, you know, my business mind really put together a good deal here.
[time=3353] You know, I really played the market. I positioned myself right in the marketplace.
[time=3357] And when that opening came, I was there and I had prepared myself and I and I and I and I and I.
[time=3366] George Whitfield, generations ago, read this prayer request that was given to him on a Sunday morning just before he's about to speak.
[time=3376] Took a crumpled note out of his pocket and read this.
[time=3379] The prayers of this congregation are desired for a young man who has become heir to an immense fortune and feels much need of the grace of God to keep him humble in the midst of his riches.
[time=3396] We're prosperous people. Oh, maybe compared to the man two seats down, maybe you don't have as much, but we are a prosperous people.
[time=3405] But there's a danger in there. It's the inherent danger of pride.
[time=3410] A third practical lesson is this.
[time=3413] Just as prosperity often leads to pride, pride often leads to independence.
[time=3419] Here's a man who said, "I don't need anybody else. I don't need the priests. I don't need the church. I don't need anybody else. I'll do it all my own."
[time=3429] I don't know how many churches have been started for the wrong reason.
[time=3433] Little churches proc up here and there and some of them do well by God's grace, but too many of them are born out of the fact that somebody didn't like their church.
[time=3441] Somebody said, "You had to do things this way." So they said, "Oh, yeah, watch me. I'll make my own church."
[time=3447] "I don't need accountability. I'm independent. I'll take care of it."
[time=3453] Be careful of an independent spirit. God's not looking for an independent person.
[time=3459] He's looking for someone who'll be dependent upon him.
