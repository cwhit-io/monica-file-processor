[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=60] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour, with inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks. Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=85] In the spring of great love, in the spring of old, in the fall, as in the spring of great love, in the heart of great love.
[time=112] When I shall run, I shall have a reason, and take me home, I shall fill my heart.
[time=124] When I shall bow, in the blood of Rachel, when there will cling, I'll not bring that home.
[time=136] And since my soul I say for God to be, I'll bring that home, I'll bring that home.
[time=171] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=185] Thank you, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=207] Thank you, you may be seated, you may be seated, you may be seated, you may be seated.
[time=230] Our choir is going to sing a beautiful, majestic anthem of praise. He is holy, and it ends with that familiar. Holy, holy, holy.
[time=245] Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=272] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise.
[time=284] I stand in His presence of praise, and crown Him with worship and praise. Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=305] Holy is He.
[time=324] Who gardens my iniquities who heals me from within? Who lifts my fallen life and sets me on my feet again?
[time=339] Who lifts me like a shepherd when I call the spring? My life, my life, my Jesus.
[time=352] Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=375] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise.
[time=386] I stand in His presence of praise, and crown Him with worship and praise. Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=412] Who hears me in my loneliness who finds me where I hide? Who knocks outside my broken heart till I let Him inside?
[time=431] Who's life deserves the honor waiting for His throne? I learn my life, my Jesus.
[time=444] I shake your hand by all. Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=466] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise.
[time=476] I stand in His presence of praise, and crown Him with worship and praise. Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=495] Holy is He.
[time=510] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all my words shall praise My King in earth and sky and sea.
[time=534] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in preparation, blessed unity.
[time=562] Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=586] I stand in His presence of praise, and crown Him with worship and praise.
[time=599] Holy is He, and so He is He.
[time=641] This is the beginning of the fall, but a combination of a great summer where we've had a wonderful
[time=662] time praising the Lord weekly at Blackhawk Baptist Church. Thank you for your participation in response to the choir, a great number. Let's continue now counting our blessings as we sing together Him number 624. We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas, Him number
[time=679] 624.
[time=701] Holy is He, and He is His glory.
[time=817] Thank you for your singing, and I hope while you were singing you reflected on the many blessings that God gives us. We welcome back home, Keith and Starr Bronegum. Keith is back at Indiana University for his final year in his doctorate program there. They're
[time=833] going to be with us this morning and also for a concert this evening. Let me invite you to come back and be with us this evening for a great time of music, of caring and sharing,
[time=843] and just God's blessing reflected in and through our congregation tonight. Let's listen, however,
[time=849] as they sing for us now, a great hymn entitled, "Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised."
[time=858] "Great is the Lord, He is holy and just, by His power we trust in His love."
[time=871] "Great is the Lord, He is faithful and true, by His mercy He proves His love."
[time=879] "Great is the Lord and worthy of glory. Great is the Lord and worthy of praise."
[time=887] "Great is the Lord, now lift up your voice, now lift up your voice."
[time=893] "Great is the Lord, great is the Lord."
[time=908] "Great is the Lord, His holy and just, by His power we trust in His love."
[time=916] "Great is the Lord, He is faithful and true, by His mercy He proves His love."
[time=923] "Great is the Lord and worthy of glory. Great is the Lord and worthy of praise."
[time=931] "Great is the Lord, now lift up your voice, now lift up your voice, now lift up your voice."
[time=938] "Great is the Lord, great is the Lord."
[time=951] "Great are you Lord and worthy of glory. Great are you Lord and worthy of praise."
[time=958] "Great are you Lord, I lift up my voice, I lift up my voice."
[time=964] "Great are you Lord, great are you Lord, great are you Lord, great are you Lord."
[time=987] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1007] We've certainly appreciated Keith and Starr over the years and it's a special delight to have them here with us today.
[time=1013] Pete, I'm looking forward to tonight as well.
[time=1016] Well, we always welcome Keith and Starr because they're part of our church but they're away from us right now as Keith is studying at Indiana University.
[time=1023] Keith and Starr will be back tonight for a concert.
[time=1026] It'll begin at six o'clock and their music is full of variety, certainly full of ministry and they just love the Lord and love to sing.
[time=1035] We're just excited about the opportunity that we have tonight to hear them in concert at six o'clock.
[time=1041] I'm looking forward to that too. I believe in our schedule we're going to have a 30 minute concert from Keith and Starr and then a praise service where we take our auditorium and spread out some microphones and invite our people to come and to share a word of testimony, some praise for what God has been doing in their life and in life of our church and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1061] Rick, this is a Sunday of reflection because certainly God has been good to us throughout this whole year, especially this summer.
[time=1067] We had a great summer. We always expect that people will be gone and they took their normal vacations but our people were very faithful and we're thankful to the Lord for that.
[time=1075] You know, it can be a very tough time for a church in the summer because many people look at that as a 12 week vacation and our people have hung right in there.
[time=1084] The choir, the Sunday school teachers and the attendance were thankful for that and want to give God the praise and the credit.
[time=1090] We have a pamphlet that we want to share with you. Actually, it's far more than a pamphlet. It's a way of studying the scriptures.
[time=1097] As a pastor, I have discovered something that has been both disappointing to me and concerning to me and that is the few number of people who actually on their own, Monday through Friday, are reading God's Word.
[time=1111] Many people come today on Sunday morning and take their Bible out and inside is last Sunday's bulletin where we were studying for last Sunday's message and they discarded on their way in and stick a new bulletin in and their Bibles never touched between.
[time=1127] That's impossible for someone to grow and to be all that God wants them to be without being consistent and daily in God's Word.
[time=1136] Yet, Pete, I find that people say to me, "I've tried to study the Bible and I just never get anywhere. I don't understand what I'm reading."
[time=1143] I'm sure it's difficult for some people to just open the Bible and start, but the Timeless Insight is very systematic and especially as we look forward to the month of October, that's the beginning of the study of the New Testament, Rick, and it's an excellent time for people to get started and go chronologically through the New Testament.
[time=1160] Well, Pete, I've got a copy of the October Timeless Insight right in my hand and we begin by reading Matthew chapter one and then after reading Matthew chapter one, there's what we call a Timeless Insight.
[time=1174] This one's provided by John Calvin, the great Presbyterian thinker out of Geneva, Switzerland in the 1500s and he gives an insight that is so valuable for our understanding of the Scripture.
[time=1187] And then equally as important, there comes a part that we call the Timeless or the Timely Response, a way for us to take what we've read, what we've gotten insight about and apply it to our lives.
[time=1198] We want to send you a copy of Timeless Insights because we believe it's the best tool that we can give you to help you to study God's Word day by day.
[time=1207] So many people are looking for great experiences and they're trying to run off of emotional energy. Neither of those is God's design.
[time=1215] As we'll study this morning, one of the things that we should be thankful for is that God has given us his Word that we can grow by it.
[time=1223] Are you growing? If you are, I'm sure you're studying his Word. If you're not growing, I'm sure you're not studying it.
[time=1230] We'd like to send you a copy of this today so that on October 1st, you can begin through the New Testament with us in Matthew.
[time=1237] Pete, will you tell our friends how they can receive their copy?
[time=1240] Let me encourage you right now to write for Timeless Insights.
[time=1244] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1257] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today. And if you are watching here on Channel 21 here in Fort Wayne at 11 o'clock, then you're watching a live broadcast.
[time=1268] And tonight you can come and join us at 6 o'clock for a live concert with Keith and Starr Brodigan in a time of praise for our church family.
[time=1278] I hope you'll join us today. Do write for Timeless Insights. And when you write, would you be so kind as to give us the call letters of the station that you're watching? Thank you.
[time=1308] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1359] As his spirit fills you inside, may you know his power every day of your life as you rest in his love and abide.
[time=1385] O abide with me, first falls even tied.
[time=1397] When darkness deepens, Lord with me abide.
[time=1409] When all the helpless fail and come forths free, help of the helpless, O abide with me.
[time=1438] I feel no foe with thee at hand to bless.

[time=1532] [MUSIC]
[time=1552] Thank you, Keith. On this morning, when we want to thank God for his love and for his goodness, I would like to lead us in responsive reading number six
[time=1561] in the back of our hymn book. When David, by the inspiration of God, wrote many of the Psalms, they were designed not only to be read for personal meditation, but they were given to be sung, to be a part of choral reading
[time=1574] and to be a part of a congregational reading. In the back of our hymn book, there is a responsive reading, number six, which is a compilation of verses from Psalm 34.
[time=1586] As you will notice, there are some verses in light and some in dark type. I will read the light type and then ask you as a congregation to read responsibly the darker print, Psalm 34 in part.
[time=1602] The goodness of God, I will bless the Lord at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
[time=1621] O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.
[time=1629] I sought the Lord in the early and the early from all my years.
[time=1636] They looked unto him and were lightened, and their faces were not ashamed.
[time=1645] This morning, Christ, and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his trials.
[time=1653] The angel of the Lord in campeth round about them that fear him and deliverth them.
[time=1661] O for days can see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man that trusted in him.
[time=1668] O fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.
[time=1677] Give the light as you lack to suffer from her.
[time=1681] The day that speak the Lord shall not want you to live.
[time=1686] The righteous cry and the Lord hearth, and deliverth them out of all their troubles.
[time=1695] The Lord is not ashamed of our world of heart, and is saved as such as the day of the time of God's spirit.
[time=1704] Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliverth him out of them all.
[time=1713] The Lord will be Jesus the soul of the servants, and none of them will be trusted in him shall be listened.
[time=1721] God, we thank you for your word, and pray that it might be a blessing to your praise and to our growth.
[time=1730] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1742] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]

[time=1866] Father, today we've met to proclaim your praise.
[time=1874] And the greatest blessing that each of us can give thanks for today is the privilege of belonging to you and to be able to sing "I am his"
[time=1887] and he is mine.
[time=1891] God, today we thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ and that he is in our hearts and that he has given us forgiveness and cleansing and new life.
[time=1901] Thank you that we belong to you.
[time=1903] Thank you, God, that we know that we have a home beyond this world today because we belong to you.
[time=1910] Thank you for a sense of ownership that we belong to you.
[time=1916] Father, thank you for the praise that we can give for the blessings that you have poured out on our lives.
[time=1922] And many of us today, when we count our blessings, the list becomes innumerable.
[time=1929] Infinite has been your goodness and magnanimous has been your blessing.
[time=1936] And God, we have said today, praise you.
[time=1940] Great are you.
[time=1942] Worthy are you of glory and honor.
[time=1945] God, we wish that we had a thousand tongues in each of our mouths to shout the praises that reign within our hearts.
[time=1953] Thank you, God, for who you are.
[time=1956] Holy is he.
[time=1958] God, your name is holy.
[time=1961] And we are not worthy to even bow before you in prayer, but by your son, Jesus Christ, who has made us acceptable and the beloved.
[time=1969] And we thank you.
[time=1971] Father, today, for those who are knowing great victory in life, give to us the constant perspective that it is you who have raised us up.
[time=1981] We thank you.
[time=1983] Father, for those today who find it difficult to speak of praise because of hurt.
[time=1990] You pray that you would strengthen their hearts.
[time=1994] Particularly for those who have lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=1999] None more so than Joe and Martha and their family.
[time=2005] God, as you took their son to be with you, we pray that you will give to them hope proportional to their hurt.
[time=2013] Your word, even as we read it this morning, said, "Many are the afflictions of a righteous."
[time=2019] God, they've been afflicted.
[time=2021] Your word promises that you'll deliver.
[time=2023] We pray that you will.
[time=2025] We thank you for the deliverance you've given to many this week through medicine and hospital tests.
[time=2031] Thank you for encouraging reports for Carol, for Martha, and Glenna.
[time=2037] Thank you, God.
[time=2039] Thank you for a body of people who have committed themselves to serving you.
[time=2045] Thank you for these today who've come to worship.
[time=2049] Through your word, Father, we would want to magnify you and see growth in our lives.
[time=2056] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=2059] [AMEN] I want to invite you to open your Bible with us this morning as we begin a new study, a study of the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=2069] If you don't know where 1 Corinthians is, that's quite all right.
[time=2074] We're glad that people are here who are beginning their spiritual pilgrimage, who are searchers.
[time=2079] This is not an exclusive church that you've got to know everything before you can come.
[time=2084] We've opened our doors and our hearts to you who are hungry to know that Jesus Christ is real.
[time=2090] And so this morning, as we study the Scriptures, we invite you to study with us.
[time=2095] 1 Corinthians, book of the New Testament, 1 The Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=2103] Then there are the books of the epistles after Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians.
[time=2109] We're in chapter 1 for our first study today.
[time=2112] Paul wrote to a church about 1900 and roughly 30 years ago.
[time=2119] Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and sauced the knees, our brother.
[time=2129] Under the Church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus,
[time=2135] called to be saints with all that are in every place who call upon the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, both theirs and ours.
[time=2147] Grace be unto you, and peace from God, our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2158] I thank my God, always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ,
[time=2168] that in everything ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge.
[time=2176] Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that ye may come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2188] who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2196] God is faithful by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=2209] As Paul writes, he begins with his familiar form of identifying himself, identifying his audience, and then a traditional word of greeting.
[time=2219] The author Paul, no introduction is needed there. Paul was perhaps the most known figure in the entire scripture apart from the Lord Jesus himself.
[time=2230] Paul was an unbeliever, not only an unbeliever but antagonistic towards Jesus Christ, but he had a conversion experience,
[time=2240] a new birth when he was born again, and he trusted in Christ, and Christ entered into his heart.
[time=2247] And God uniquely used him because of his academic and spiritual preparation.
[time=2254] And God sent him out to begin the spread of the gospel.
[time=2259] The word to send out in Greek is "Appostello" from which we take and put into English letters and come up with the words "apostle".
[time=2268] Paul identifies himself as someone sent out, not simply by his own choosing or by popular demand, but sent out by the very will of God.
[time=2278] He was selected by God, and he was living out the will of God by declaring to the city of Corinth the Lord Jesus Christ, by the will of God.
[time=2288] I believe today that none of us, either myself as a pastor nor you as the pew people, are apostles.
[time=2298] I believe that that word can be used in a very generic sense, and it is in scripture, but it is also used in a specific sense to describe those who had a personal, visible, historic encounter with Christ, and were commissioned by him to go out.
[time=2315] Paul was an apostle by the will of God.
[time=2318] But in a similar way, God has a will for your life and for mine, and for the Lord Jesus to guide us, gives us as much confidence as though we were the apostle Paul.
[time=2328] He is the one who guides and directs our paths if we walk in obedience to his word.
[time=2334] There was a pastor of a church who was less than well received.
[time=2338] He was a bit rough on the congregation, and finally the morning came when he stood up and he said, "Ladies and gentlemen, the same Lord Jesus that called me to this church has called me to another one."
[time=2349] The song leader came to the pulpit and led the congregation in singing, "What a friend we have in Jesus."
[time=2356] Well, Jesus does call. Jesus does direct. Not only pastors to pulpit, but people to churches and people to ministry to serve in a Bible study in your home are administered by sharing Christ through a ministry of compassion with those who are wounded.
[time=2373] He does call today.
[time=2375] He calls us through the walk of obedience, the inner working of his spirit and the declaration of his word.
[time=2382] Paul writes as an apostle, one called by the will of God, and then he says, "And saustanies are brothers."
[time=2389] That is not to say that saustanies was co-author. Paul was co-author.
[time=2394] He was ghost writing for the Holy Ghost, if you'll pardon that expression.
[time=2398] But saustanies was a traveling companion with Paul in Ephesus as he wrote back to Corinth.
[time=2404] So saustanies in all probability is the same man with the same name in Acts chapter 18, who was at that time an unbelieving ruler of the Jewish synagogue in Corinth.
[time=2415] Now a believer because Paul calls him our brother.
[time=2419] So Paul is writing to a church that he established with saustanies, someone who came to Christ from that church now in Ephesus.
[time=2427] And he writes to a group of people he describes first by physical and then secondly by spiritual description.
[time=2435] Physically he says to the church that is in Corinth.
[time=2438] Now please when we say church, don't picture this stone building with stained glass windows, pews and a steeple.
[time=2446] Many of you have never had that image of a church having worshiped here all of your life, but sometimes we think of churches as building.
[time=2453] The word church doesn't really refer to building as it does the assembly of people.
[time=2458] We're a church here today whether we're in this auditorium or the Grand Wayne like we were last month or if we're at full in your theater or out in the park we're in assembly.
[time=2467] That is the church.
[time=2469] And he says the church which is at Corinth, Corinth, a geographical location of a city.
[time=2477] Corinth is almost indescribable in its decadence.
[time=2482] To think that there's a church there is like a true rose amongst the thorns.
[time=2487] Corinth was a major metropolitan city having a strategic location.
[time=2492] If you can picture the Greek peninsula, it is a rather wide peninsula that juts from the north southward into the Mediterranean Sea.
[time=2501] Then that relatively wide peninsula shapes and becomes extremely narrow.
[time=2507] So that there's just a small isthmus that connects it with the larger almost island but still part of the peninsula at the bottom.
[time=2518] That southern part looks like a hand and is called Peloponnesus which means the five fingers.
[time=2526] Right where that isthmus comes so narrow is located a number of small cities in one major city in the middle by the name of Corinth.
[time=2536] There is a road, a major trade route that connected the southern peninsula with the northern peninsula which obviously had to go through the isthmus that was dominated by Corinth.
[time=2548] So it was a major trade route but even more significantly is that ships coming from the east, from the middle east and from Turkey and from the Dardenelles and the Straits of Bosphorus that feed the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
[time=2563] Ships would come to the bay outside of Corinth and there because of the treacherous waters south of the Peloponnesus they would literally drag the ships on rollers across the narrow isthmus and put them on the bay at the other side.
[time=2578] It was quicker and it was safer and so Corinth is strategically located at a crossroads north and south by a trade route east and west by a shipping route and it was a true cosmopolitan city.
[time=2591] There were major groups from around the world. There were Asiatics, there were Hebrews, there were Romans, there were Greeks.
[time=2599] It was a pluralistic society with pluralistic values, most of which were extremely, the coin of phrase of the Bible, carnal.
[time=2611] In this city the dominant religion that would be worshipped would be an eclectic blending together of the Greek pantheon.
[time=2620] On the Arco Corinth, which simply means the high point of Corinth, there was a temple and daily at night from that temple would come a stream of 1000 prostitutes carrying torches that would come in the name of the religion of the Greeks into the cities and bid the citizens to join them in their immorality.
[time=2640] That was their form of worship. Their concept of religion was simply to create a voice that spoke words that they wanted to hear.
[time=2650] Into this city, the Apostle Paul arrives and proclaims the Lord Jesus Christ and a church is built. The church in Corinth. But their describe is more than just being in Corinth.
[time=2664] They're described two times with the same root word. He says those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints.
[time=2677] Sanctified is simply the verb form of being processed to the point of being a saint. You may have some misconceptions of saints like we often have misconceptions of churches.
[time=2690] When I think of a saint too often I think of someone who lived in an undesirable time who selected the most undesirable of locations in his time and adopted the most undesirable lifestyle of his time and as a reward for all that someone made a stone statue out of him.
[time=2709] Through which time has broken off the arms and the feet and the cobwebs cover the face and it stands in a little niche and some cathedral veer up. That's a saint. God save us from such a role.
[time=2725] That's not at all what the Bible means by saint. The word saint or sanctified simply means that God took a hold of us and that he, not we ourselves, but that he cleansed us, washed us and made us holy and set us apart for special use.
[time=2748] God says I've cleansed you and I've set you apart for special use. Obviously my responsibilities take me off into the hospital. Many of you here are part of the caring and medical profession. Television has brought us all into the operating room and there we discover a behavior that is set apart.
[time=2774] Hands are methodically scrubbed. Gloves are put on and then the hands are held up like this to keep them from being contaminated and everything that goes into that room has been cleansed. It's been sterilized.
[time=2790] It is no longer a cutting utensil. It is a sterilized scalpel. Forceps, probes, instruments are all clean as clean can get them because they're set apart for a strategic special use.
[time=2810] God says I have taken my son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and by his blood I have cleansed you. I have washed you as nothing else could make you clean. And now I am setting you apart for my special use, your special.
[time=2829] It cost me much to put you into usable shape. Keep yourself clean. So Paul describes the people with great contrast to where they lived as to who they were. The contrast cannot be exaggerated.
[time=2846] As a matter of fact in the ancient world Corinth was so wicked, so decadent that if you wanted to call someone by a name that was lower than any other name you would call them, why you file Corinthian.
[time=2865] To call someone a Corinthian was to call them a barbarian of barbarians. Unmannered, uncouth, unclean. And God says you in Corinth, you in that unclean city, I have made clean and I've set you apart to be my instrument of light right where you're at.
[time=2888] And then he gives him his traditional but potent words of greeting. He says grace and peace to you. Grace represents everything that God does out of his love and mercy for us and peace is what he puts in us to live under his grace.
[time=2907] Now we come to the primary section of our study today. Verse 4 Paul begins by saying I thank my God. You say well what could Paul be thankful for in Corinth? There wasn't much to be thankful for.
[time=2924] As we read 1 Corinthians we discover that they had just about every problem a church could have. In the first few verses Paul is trying to piece together a church that's been ripped apart by envy and strife and jealousy and division.
[time=2939] I like this guy's idea better than that. And matter of fact if they don't go the way this guy said I don't think I'm going to go there anymore. Maybe I'll go I just won't give.
[time=2949] Now then I'll make him suffer. Then they'll see that I'm right. Oh I'll go but I'll fold my arms and I'll lean back and I'll look over my nose which is quite a distance.
[time=2963] And I'll let them know without saying a word that I don't like the way things are going there. Oh I'll go. Yeah I've got to go there there's no place else to go but you won't catch me lifting my little finger there.
[time=2979] That's how they reacted. One said I like the way Paul did and if you're not going to do it the way Paul did then we might as well not do it. No. Peter. Peter was a two-fisted fisherman and he told us what to do and if we don't do it with a style Peter then word you's not doing.
[time=2997] And on and on and the division went. Paul said I'm thankful for you. Then you come to chapters four, five and six. It reads like dynasty, greed and morality and power. That's what everybody wanted.
[time=3014] In the church they were known for their open immorality. Chapter seven tells us that they were people who went from one extreme to the other. This group said ah you don't like her lever. He's a jerk dump him. Get a divorce. Forget him. This group said don't ever get married.
[time=3035] This group said ah marry anybody you like. Change every few years. Don't ever get married. Neither were right. Then you come to chapters eight and nine and these people had taken their liberty and used it as an occasion to the flesh. Paul said I'm thankful.
[time=3054] You come to chapters ten and eleven. These people had taken communion and a family time around a table of sharing together and they turned it into the biggest bash in town and the hero was the first guy that needed to be carried out.
[time=3069] And Paul said I'm thankful for you. Come to chapters twelve, thirteen, fourteen. There's charismatic confusion as it's known even today. This one said my gift's better than your gift. No my gift's better than yours. Sounds like my dog's bigger than your dog because he eats kennel ration. That was the mentality.
[time=3091] Arrogance, supremacy, domination. Chapter fifteen, these people were so immature, so void of scriptural knowledge they thought every doctrine was optional. You know doctrine divides. It's the spirit that unites. Let's not teach any doctrine. You don't believe in the resurrection? No big deal. Resurrection? No big deal. If Jesus Christ is not raised from the dead, then we're sitting in this auditorium that desperately needs air conditioning.
[time=3120] And the air conditioning is in vain. Paul said I'm thankful for you. What on earth could he find to be thankful for in the Corinthians? It sounds more like the dirty dozen, doesn't it? Someone told me a story between the services. He said you can always find something to be thankful for. Like the woman who prayed God, thank you for my two teeth and that they meet.
[time=3148] There's usually something that we can find some occasion to be thankful for. Dr. Edmond White was pastor of the Edinburgh church. He began his prayer every Sunday morning. The congregation could predict it. Now we thank the God for. He would give a lengthy prayer of thankfulness.
[time=3170] Times it had been bad and this Sunday was the worst. A storm had kept just about everyone away but just a handful of the faithful. They came together and they sat down. They said the good doctors not going to have anything to be thankful for today.
[time=3185] Dr. White began his prayer. Now we thank the God that it's not always like this. You know we laugh and I find that to be a cute story but you know it's true isn't it?
[time=3198] Some days we have to look a long way to find something to be thankful for and maybe it is simply that it's not always this bad. That's why the song writer wrote. It won't always rain.
[time=3211] But you know some of us today are knocked off balance. I played football not very well but I played football. My coach said that I was too small for my speed or too slow for my size.
[time=3224] Other than ability I really was going to do well. One of my problems in football was being relatively small in high school. When I would go running around the side if one of these big guys just hit me they knocked me off balance.
[time=3240] And I discovered that you can't play football off balance. You know occasionally there's somebody in life that hits us. Our tragedy that hits us. Our financial reverse that hits us. Our remark that's made that hits us and it knocks us off balance.
[time=3259] And so though there is a scale called equilibrium when we get hit we're totally off balance and the weight of this pain is over here dominating our life.
[time=3272] That's the time that it's most important that we do just as we have sung is that we count our blessings. Doesn't necessarily make the pain go away but as we remember this.
[time=3284] And then the second thing and then we count a third and a fourth and a fifth blessing and we begin to add them slowly as we count those blessings it brings balance back to life.
[time=3295] Paul was one who was gifted with balance and he saw six things in the Corinthians to be thankful for. Let me give them to you very quickly.
[time=3304] First of all in verse four he gives thanks for salvation by Christ. He says I thank God on behalf of you for. For what? For the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ.
[time=3320] God has taken his grace and it came to you in the person of Jesus Christ who died for your sins and you today may know financial reverse. You may know loss of loved one. You may know defeat in the business market but you today have been given salvation by Jesus Christ.
[time=3339] Paul's consumed with a personal relationship with Christ. Do you know in these first nine verses that we've read he references Jesus Christ nine times?
[time=3349] A few years ago cabbage patch dolls came out. We have two little girls. They found the catalog. Daddy this book's got cabbage patch dolls and do you want to see the cabbage patch dolls?
[time=3364] Boy these cabbage patch dolls are really nice. Look at this cabbage patch. About the ten times they said cabbage patch dolls. It became odd of yes. I said would you girls like a cabbage patch doll?
[time=3376] Beaming eyes and smile? Tell your grandma.
[time=3382] You know there's something about repetition that gets the message across doesn't it?
[time=3387] Cabbage patch cabbage patch. Paul wanted to get the message across. What did they have in a world that was rejecting them that was physically persecuting them?
[time=3398] Stosthenes who was with Paul had been beaten. What did they have? They had Jesus Christ. They had Jesus Christ and with him they had everything and without him they had nothing but more than just repeating Jesus Christ.
[time=3414] He also repeats another phrase, ours, yours, mine. It wasn't just the Jesus Christ of history. It was a Jesus Christ that you could know that could be your Savior.
[time=3432] Do you know him today? See the God or is he your God? I hope he's yours.
