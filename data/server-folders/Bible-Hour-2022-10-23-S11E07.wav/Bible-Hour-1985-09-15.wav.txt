[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (uplifting music) [MUSIC - 9 seconds]
[time=46] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=49] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rickoff.
[time=66] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=70] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=103] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=107] What a joy it is to be able to sit on the platform and to hear nearly a hundred voices from this way and several hundred from this way saying, "How great thou art." You know, if you didn't feel great when you came in, you'd feel good now because God has designed us for His praise and for His glory.
[time=126] And when we praise the Lord, we get lifted up.
[time=130] We're so thankful that you've come to join us today for our worship service and want to also welcome our friends who have joined us for the Bible Hour.
[time=138] Both here in this auditorium and through television, the very purpose of our lives is to bring praise and glory to the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[time=149] We hope today that you know God personally through an intimate relationship with Christ.
[time=155] If not today, this day, would you give your heart full attention to the ministry of God's Word and song as we study the Scriptures and we sing praises today so that you can discover that Jesus Christ is real and that He can be real in your life.
[time=172] There's a song that we have sung often, "How great thou art." But it's more than just a song, it's a philosophy of life, that our heart is purposed to give praise to Him.
[time=182] Listen to our choir as they lead us in an anthem of praise about Christians joining to sing of the greatness of our God.
[time=199] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=393] Come Christians join to sing, stand up, stand up for Jesus as the continued theme of our music today.
[time=403] Let's sing together Him number 619.
[time=406] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas of stand up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=412] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=548] crisis pregnancy center and we were so thankful for their ministry and impressed with its purposes
[time=554] and philosophy that we as a missions committee took to our board of deacons and they agreed wholeheartedly that that's something that we wanted to be supporting and I thought the best way for you to know about the crisis pregnancy center was not for me to tell you about it but to ask the director to come and to share just a few words. So Joyce if you would come and join me we want to introduce to you Joyce McDougal who is the director of the crisis pregnancy center. Joyce welcome to Blackhawk today we're glad that you're here. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. Oh it's our privilege. Joyce many of our people may not know what a crisis pregnancy center is. Tell us just a little bit about the ministry. Okay we are a ministry that reaches out to women who are experiencing crisis pregnancies with both practical assistance and the love of Christ. We try to provide whatever they might need physically, emotionally and spiritually to carry their babies to term.
[time=607] We are the alternative to the abortion clinic. We provide free pregnancy testing and then depending upon their situation we follow up with counseling, guidance and support for the woman who's considering abortion we share with her the truth of the abortion procedure the development of the fetus and the unborn child and the potential risk and complications to her. We share with her also God's word we talk about her relationship with the Lord and what God's word says about abortion. We have a variety of services for those who do choose life. We want to support that decision and help them in any way we can. We have child birth instruction. We're beginning to organize a Bible study. We just have a variety of services to provide whatever needs they might have. Joyce I'm excited about that because we as
[time=651] Christians are often famous for what we don't believe in. We don't believe in abortion but it's more important than that to say what do we believe in and you've provided the good alternative. We're thankful for that. What type of response have you seen?
[time=666] Okay well since we opened we have seen a number of girls. All those statistics do not really convey the story of what's happening down there at the center. I would like to share some of them with you because they do indicate what kind of activity is going on. Since our doors opened on January 22nd we have seen 387 clients. Of those 224 had a positive test
[time=687] result. Of the 224 186 girls chose to carry their babies to term. 27 of the decisions
[time=694] are unknown. Nine chose abortion and two are undecided at this point. The changed minds
[time=701] we had 10 that changed from abortion initially when they came in to carrying their babies and 18 who were undecided who then changed to carry. So we see this as a great response.
[time=711] We started out within February we saw 17 clients in August we saw 70. So we are increasing
[time=717] we're going to be moving to a larger facility and we hope to be able to meet the needs of even more people in our community. Joyce that's exciting. How can our people be of support and encouragement and participate with you. Okay well as you can imagine in this kind of work the struggles each day dealing with this life and death issue is sometimes
[time=737] overwhelming for all of the volunteers who are working there each day. So we would first and foremost ask for your prayer. That's something that everyone in here can do both young and old. Secondly your financial support. I want to start out by thanking this particular congregation here at Blackhawk for your monthly support to us as a church. And also for those who are contributing individually we greatly appreciate your gifts. Thirdly as volunteers
[time=762] we are almost totally volunteer on the only paid staff person so there's a variety of jobs to be done. There's counseling hotline counseling providing transportation writers committee workers and just a number of things. Anybody who's here that wants to be involved we've got something for you. If you tried to get involved last year and weren't contacted it's probably because we weren't organized or volunteers we didn't have enough to contact you but now we do and we're ready to recruit more volunteers. Well thank you Joyce we can pray for the ministry we can support it financially and then you can call and get involved as a volunteer. Joyce thank you for taking your time to being with us this morning. Thank you so much. Crisis Pregnancy Center is such a positive alternative to the way the world
[time=806] would dispose of an unwanted child. We're so thankful that God has raised up a ministry like that and that we can be partnerships together with it. Marilyn Wong is going to come now and lead us in worship in a song that says let there be joy in this place let there be grace let there be praise. Marilyn thank you so much for the work you do. This song is such an encouragement to each of us.
[time=845] Let there be praise let there be joy in our hearts sing to the Lord give him the glory.
[time=861] Let there be praise let there be joy in our hearts forever more let his love fill the
[time=872] air and let there be praise. He inhabits the praise of his people and dwells deep within
[time=883] the peace that he gives an untenable his love it knows no end so lift your voices with
[time=894] gladness sing proclaim through all the earth that Jesus Christ is King. Let there be praise
[time=906] let there be joy in our hearts sing to the Lord give him the glory. Let there be praise
[time=919] let there be joy in our hearts forever more let his love fill the air and let there be
[time=930] praise. When the spirit of God is within us we will overcome in our weaknesses strength
[time=940] will defend us when it praises on our tongue so lift your voices with gladness sing proclaim
[time=953] through all the earth that Jesus Christ is King. Let there be grace let there be joy in our
[time=964] hearts sing to the Lord give him the glory. Let there be praise let there be joy in our
[time=977] hearts forever more let his love fill the air and let there be praise and let there be
[time=991] and let there be praise. Pete good morning and I know this is going to be a very busy
[time=1011] day for you but we are thankful that we have a few moments away from the live television ministry to talk with our friends here about timeless insights. Good morning Rick yes we are excited about the fact that we're starting the fall a quarter again in the beginning of October with timeless insights and we begin in the book of Matthew the first book of the New Testament. Pete almost every week and I don't say this to exaggerate nearly every
[time=1036] week someone says to me in a personal time of talking about the Lord that as they read the Bible they're not sure where to go and they they always end up reading the same passages again and again and that's one reason why we promote timeless insights is that it helps you the student to move systematically through the entire New Testament in the year I'd venture
[time=1056] to say very few people really read through the entire New Testament. That's right I think that one of the most interesting parts of it is not only do you read the portion of scripture but that you have men of God who have studied for years and can interpret some of the passages of scripture that are perhaps a little bit more difficult and you also have a timely response it's called or you can respond to the reading that you've had for that particular day it's not a lengthy passage but it is very exciting and also informative and you can move
[time=1084] from day to day then through the scriptures. One of the things that's essential no matter what we're doing whether we're running a business, teaching a classroom, raising our children or studying God's word is consistency and so we want you to have timeless insights
[time=1099] so that you can consistently study God's word day in and day out. Timeless insights is provided
[time=1107] by the Bible hour as a ministry to you we want to send it to you and give you your copy free so if you'll write to us today we'll be glad to send you your own copy we're encouraging you to write right now so that we can get it to you by October the 1st which is where we begin the Book of Matthew and start the New Testament cycle again. Pete tell our friends how they can receive a copy please. You can receive timeless insights by writing to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815 right to the Bible
[time=1139] hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Thank you, Pete. While we're here together
[time=1147] I would like to ask you to do us a favor we would love to hear from you by way of a note or a letter particularly if God has used this ministry of the Bible hour significantly in
[time=1158] your spiritual life. About 10 days ago someone and I were talking and I just began to probe
[time=1164] where they're at spiritually and I said have you ever received Christ as your Savior? She said why yes I did watching the Bible hour in my home. I suspect that there are many many more like her who have received Christ but we don't know about it. We'd love to hear
[time=1179] from each of you if God has used the Bible hour to bring you to Christ or to strengthen your faith. Could we ask you to take the time to write it down and to share it with us.
[time=1189] We would greatly appreciate hearing from you. Then when you do write it would be so helpful to us if you would write down the call letters of the station that you watch the Bible hour on. Pete one more time with the address please. We encourage you to write to us by writing
[time=1205] to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Again thank you
[time=1213] for joining us today and as we go back to the live part of our morning worship service we'll be hearing Meryl and Wong as she ministers to us and son.
[time=1225] I found a friend when life seemed not worth living. I found a friend. I found a friend.
[time=1247] So tender and forgiving. I can't conceive how such a thing could be that Jesus cared for
[time=1271] even me. Each day, my faith in him is growing. He's ever near. I'll tell my Savior's story.
[time=1300] A friend so true would give his all for you. I found a friend in life began anew. I'm
[time=1321] sure you'll find that he is your friend too. Because he came, my soul will live in glory.
[time=1343] I'll praise his name. I'll tell my Savior's story. What friend so true would give his
[time=1360] all for you? I found that friend in life began anew. I'm sure you'll find that he is your
[time=1386] friend. God we are thankful today that we have found a friend in Jesus Christ. Father we
[time=1407] are set back in amazement that Jesus would say to his disciples and to us, "Henceforth
[time=1416] call me friend." God we recognize that you're a holy and a just and sovereign God and we
[time=1425] are none of those things. We're unholy and our sense of justice is a sham compared to
[time=1431] your purity. Father we don't live with self-discipline let alone sovereignty. God to think that you've
[time=1439] said that we can call you friend is more than amazing. It's more than marvelous. It is more
[time=1446] than wonderful. We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ who died on the cross that his shed
[time=1453] blood might wash us and cleanse us. Father today we do feel clean. In spite of who we
[time=1460] are and what we've done Father we feel clean today and we thank you for that experience of forgiveness. Thank you that the chain of guilt has been broken and we've been unshackled.
[time=1472] Father thank you for the freedom of heart that we can now express to you our love and thankfulness. Thank you that you've put within us a spirit of confidence in life and that as
[time=1483] we come before you we have been made acceptable and we're not afraid. So God out of thankfulness
[time=1490] we've come today to sing praises and to listen to songs that speak of you and to study your
[time=1496] word that we might know you and know your will for our life. Father we do pray in these
[time=1502] next moments as we study the scripture that you will as only you can do. Take your word
[time=1509] and apply it to every heart at its divergent point of need. We pray that it would give strength to those who lost loved ones like Kathy Peters and Joanne Martha, Linda Timmy,
[time=1522] Crystal Hall for the Downies. God we can't begin to understand the depths of their hurt
[time=1529] till we go through that experience and then we say oh God comfort them. Father we pray
[time=1535] that your word would penetrate the hearts of those who are rebellious today, rebellious against their concept of life that finds God so imposing. God may they find that surrender
[time=1549] to you is the ultimate liberation. We pray for teenagers who are struggling as well as
[time=1556] adults with depth of emotional pain. God we pray that you'd give healing and direction.
[time=1564] Father today we pray for that Christian worker who is dangerously close to becoming weary in their well doing that you would restore and renew them even today in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1576] I'd like to ask a request of you today it's rather simple I'm sure you'd be glad to do
[time=1584] it for me. Would you mind if just for the next few days if we traded jobs I'd like to go
[time=1591] to your place of work I know it's not free from hassles I'd like you to take my job I'd like you to pastor the church as a matter of fact let me give you your first assignment you'll enjoy this this morning. You've just become the pastor of a church but it's not this church it's it's a different church and as you have come into your office you have
[time=1612] opened up the mail and there is a letter from the church treasure dear pastor boy are we
[time=1618] glad you're here just thought you should know that we're two months behind in our budget
[time=1624] well God bless you we're glad you're here you didn't quite get the note finished and someone has called and you pick up line one it's for you someone just wanted to let you
[time=1636] know that Mr. and Mrs. so-and-so had broken up that Mr. so-and-so was now running around
[time=1643] with Mrs. such-and-such and that her husband well he had always been a scoundrel and as a matter of fact everybody in the church knew that and no one really cared and everyone just said that's fine and you said ma'am could I put you on hold for just a moment because
[time=1659] there's a knock at my door and one of the men of the church comes in and says I just want
[time=1665] to know what you think I should be doing I'm being sued by four other members of the church and it goes to court tomorrow secretary buzzes you and says there's a call for you on line
[time=1675] three line one's going blink blink blink and it's this lady said pastor I had the most wonderful experience I went to this other church and I was just sitting there nothing happened to me but all these people around me my pastor they started saying things I'd never heard before in different languages and then when I came out pastor they said if I couldn't do that that you that I wasn't a Christian the God spirit really wasn't my
[time=1700] life what should I do pastor by the way I'm going back to that church tonight you had
[time=1706] just thumbed through the minutes of the last deacons meeting and read how at the communion table when you had a carry-in dinner to help everyone just get to know each other turned into a drunken orgy then you recall that they ran the last two pastors out of the church
[time=1723] because some like the former pastor and some like the newer pastor and division has torn
[time=1729] the church apart then there was just one one other problem no big deal the large group
[time=1736] of Sunday school teachers had just met and they decided that the resurrection of Christ really wasn't a historical fact it was just an illustration now that's why I wanted to
[time=1748] trade jobs with you today let me ask you what you're going to do you're now the pastor what
[time=1756] will you speak on first what's your first sermon going to be about which of these problems
[time=1762] will you address first well actually that scenario which sounds all together to contemporary
[time=1769] is actually nineteen hundred and thirty years old those were the very topics that in fifty
[time=1775] five a.d. the apostle Paul wrote to the church of Corinth about isn't amazing how relevant
[time=1782] the Bible is if Solomon said anything that's worth our remembering it is this there's no new thing new thing under the sun and the Bible is so fresh and it's relevant that it's
[time=1793] able to identify the timeless problems of life and then give to us the timely response
[time=1799] those are the things that face the church of Corinth and Paul began to address welcome to the job what did you choose to speak on first the resurrection the scene a quill known
[time=1810] of Christian doctrine be a good choice did you decide to speak on financial giving not
[time=1817] a bad choice but the one the Paul by the wisdom of God spoke to as being first and being the
[time=1824] most critical is the one of division of the church that was so loyal to past personalities
[time=1831] former pastors if you will that the church was fractured as Lincoln during our civil war
[time=1838] so accurately assessed quoting Jesus a house divided against itself cannot stand churches
[time=1846] are going to have problems all of them will if you think you will find a church that has
[time=1852] no problems you won't if you buy some mysterious chance find one that doesn't have any problems
[time=1858] please don't join it or it will the reality of life division in the church was the first
[time=1866] thing Paul addressed so in first Corinthians as we began to study last week today we come
[time=1872] to chapter one verses 10 through 17 and Paul writes to the church of Corinth now I beseech
[time=1880] you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing that
[time=1887] there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind
[time=1895] and in the same judgment for it hath been reported unto me of you my brothers by them
[time=1906] who are of the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you now this I say that
[time=1917] every one of you says I am a Paul well I of a Paulist well I am Peter I'm just a Jesus
[time=1935] Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of
[time=1946] Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but Christmas and gas lest any should say that
[time=1955] I had baptized in my own name oh and I baptized also the household of Stefanus besides I know
[time=1964] not whether I baptized any other for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel
[time=1972] with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect Paul tackles head on he grabs by the throat the situation a division in the church
[time=1985] right in the middle of the passage we've read we come to the problem he says he's heard rumors
[time=1991] have gone across the Aegean seat of the city of Ephesus where Paul is now serving
[time=1997] where it has a way of getting around doesn't it comes to him that there are contentions in the contention shape up over unusual loyalty and attachment to human leaders
[time=2008] there's a group over here that says man this place fell apart the day the apostle Paul left
[time=2017] and ever since that a Paulist came and became our pastor I knew we weren't going to make it
[time=2024] and you know that situation over there why if Paul was here he would have fixed it a long time ago besides that a Paulist with all of his allegorical teaching I'm never quite sure if he's going to
[time=2036] come up with something I can live with boy if we don't get Paul back here this ship is going to sink
[time=2043] I am a Paul and I remember when Paul was here this is the way we did it and we're going to do
[time=2050] it that way as long as I'm here he crossed his arms with clenched fist and sat down in this corner
[time=2058] waiting for the bell to ring and the bell rang another jumped up and said well I'm of a Paulist
[time=2068] Acts chapter 18 tells us that a Paulist was eloquent and that he was raised in the school of
[time=2075] Alexandria and he was wise and he brought some sophistication to the pulpit he got his grammar
[time=2083] straight he didn't slur his conjunctions and he was able to take the wisdom of the Greeks
[time=2090] and the Egyptians and synthesize that into the best allegorical illustrations of Christianity
[time=2096] you could imagine there were those that were saying finally we've got some refinement in this place
[time=2102] I used to be embarrassed to bring my friends to church because with just a bunch of yahoos but now a Paulist is here and he's brought dignity I am of a Paulist and with a smug sense of reserve they went off to their corner of sophistication
[time=2118] then there were those that said I went to a weekend seminar that's called a knife between your ribs
[time=2127] and Peter also called Cephas was the speaker at this seminar and boy you want to talk about a guy
[time=2133] who can handle the word it's Peter as a matter of fact I got more from that week with Peter than
[time=2141] I've gotten from church in years as a matter of fact I'm just going to go seminar hopping I'm just
[time=2149] going to get the good stuff I hear tell Peter's going to be up in Athens in a couple weeks we're
[time=2157] We're going to get a load of people together and we're going to go up there and we're really going to find out what the word has to say.
[time=2164] Then there were those who were so spiritual that they were super spiritual.
[time=2172] And they said, "Let's forget all human leaders. We don't need apostles and we don't need pastors and we don't need teachers and we don't need personal workers and we don't need friends encouraging us.
[time=2184] Let's just all close our eyes now and let's just think about the Spirit of Jesus.
[time=2191] And whatever the Spirit of Jesus says to do, let's just do that.
[time=2197] Doctrine divides. All this arguing over baptism and communion and the resurrection, let's just feel the Spirit of Christ."
[time=2212] So there they were. How serious was it? Well, Paul said in verse 11 that he's learned that there are contentions there.
[time=2220] Contention is often translated strife. It means that things are out on the table.
[time=2226] It's just not that there's a rumbling. There is an open challenge going on. It is serious.
[time=2232] It is the point of conflict. This word, strife, erus, is a word that means to come face to face, to have it out.
[time=2241] These people were having it out.
[time=2245] It's interesting that Paul and Peter and Paulus and Christ were not in disharmony. Just their followers were.
[time=2257] It really wasn't a matter of doctrine or of teaching. It was simply a matter of personality and style.
[time=2263] I'm sure that Peter wasn't the most eloquent of people. He probably messed up the language.
[time=2270] He wasn't educated. He didn't have any background. He was a fisherman. He threw nets into the water and hauled up fish.
[time=2279] He was prone to pout. He was a bit pugnacious. He was a little bit flagmatic.
[time=2285] In one breath he'd say, "Lord, you're everything next breath." He'd say, "I never saw that guy."
[time=2295] It was kind of rough. There are some people that, just like someone who, as they say, rolls it across the table.
[time=2302] Paul's style was just the opposite. He was known before Christ as an eloquent man. He was sophisticated and some didn't like that.
[time=2311] It was division over maybe just priorities. Whenever you get around Paul, you're getting around evangelism.
[time=2319] Whenever you got around a Polish, you got around some teaching that went far beyond just evangelism.
[time=2326] They were divided to the point where they were basically saying this, "Listen, if you don't share the same commitments that I do,
[time=2335] then you really don't belong in my church." Paul is here now, and if you don't have the same commitment that I do to the missions program,
[time=2345] then maybe you shouldn't belong here. Someone says, "Well, if you're not going to go to the Peter Seminar this weekend
[time=2353] that's being held at the Colosseum, then you're really messing out on what life's all about."
[time=2360] Matter of fact, if you're not committed to the Christian school, if you're not committed to the television ministry,
[time=2366] well, I don't know about you. It was a matter of one person taking what was most important to them,
[time=2373] and rightfully so in saying, "It's going to be most important to everybody." I'm saying it.
[time=2380] You know, the real problem in each of those statements wasn't Paul, a Polish, Peter, and Christ.
[time=2385] It was the word that came before that, "I." "I am a Paul." "I am a Peter."
[time=2395] That's really where the problem was. Paul and Paul has totally agreed in doctrine.
[time=2401] Peter and Paul had a few brief conflicts that they resolved.
[time=2405] Peter says that Paul read everything he's got to say. It's good stuff. Hard to understand, but good stuff.
[time=2411] That's what he said in 2 Peter 3, 15.
[time=2415] Christ sent them all out, but here they were being raptured and pulled apart,
[time=2421] and the church was on the eve of destruction.
[time=2425] And it's now Paul's privilege in a letter to put it back together.
[time=2430] How does he go about it?
[time=2432] I think he uses five little techniques here that I want to learn, and I want you to have, and I want all of us to live by.
[time=2439] First thing he does is he uses a warm identification.
[time=2445] Now how you approach the situation is probably the most determining factor in how it comes out.
[time=2452] And Paul uses a warm identification twice, and the very first words he calls them "brothers."
[time=2460] Verse 10, "I beseech you, brothers." Verse 11, almost with a point of disappointment, he says, "For it has been reported unto me of you, my brothers."
[time=2472] That word "brother" represents an identification that is warm and that is accepting.
[time=2484] It's not you guys, better get your act together.
[time=2487] Or if I've told you once, I've told you a dozen times.
[time=2493] It's not me over here and you over there, and there's the line, and you better get on my side of it.
[time=2501] You know that word "brother" connotes at least these two things.
[time=2506] It denotes this, first of all, it denotes a relationship of intimacy, "brother."
[time=2514] I mean someone who's a part of my family got the same blood running through their veins, got the same home, the same parents, the same heritage.
[time=2524] I don't have a brother, but I've got a sister and we're very close.
[time=2527] It wasn't always that way.
[time=2530] My parents are here and they can give testimony to the fact that on trips to Florida, occasionally my shoe went on her side of the back seat, made for a pleasant ride.
[time=2540] You know, my sister got a 4.0 going through all the history courses in college.
[time=2545] And I was a history major and I was more than glad to go over and say, "Melanie, how would you handle this typing paper here?"
[time=2552] That was a lot easier than going to the library.
[time=2555] You know, there's a commonness to our background.
[time=2558] There's a relationship that has bonded there.
[time=2561] We're a brother and a sister.
[time=2563] Paul says, "You're my brothers. You're my sisters. We're just a family. We're in it together."
[time=2570] When he called him "brother," he was warmly identifying with them in intimacy.
[time=2574] But secondly, he was warmly identifying to them also of equality.
[time=2580] You know, brothers are two equals. Paul occasionally would write to someone like Timmy to say, "My son in the faith."
[time=2587] That's kind of a mechanism to remind Timothy as to who's who and to get the pecking order right.
[time=2593] And there's a time for that.
[time=2596] You know, basically Paul was saying, "I'm your friend. I'm your partner. I'm your brother. I'm one of you.
[time=2606] I'm one of you." He could have said, "I am the apostle. I'm the one that's all Jesus on the way to Damascus, not you.
[time=2613] I'm the one who the Spirit is inspiring, not you." Could have condescended, but he warmly identified with them.
[time=2622] It's no secret.
[time=2624] I'm one of Charles Wendall's biggest fans, and many of you are too, and I think it's great.
[time=2629] A survey was done of the Evangelical Free Church of Fullerton, where Chuck is the pastor.
[time=2637] And the survey by an outside group said, "Why do people go to that church?" And they began to survey the people. The people said they went there for two reasons.
[time=2645] One, he's clear, and he is. And two, and remember this one.
[time=2651] They said of Chuck Wendall, "Why he's one of us. He's one of us."
[time=2658] He signs his letters Chuck, and he speaks of himself as Chuck or Charles.
[time=2664] He's one of us, and that's why we humbly listen to his teaching, because he warmly identifies.
[time=2672] Paul wisely used that technique of solving a conflict and taking division and trying to turn it into unity.
[time=2681] He warmly identified with the people.
[time=2684] Secondly, he graciously appealed to them.
[time=2687] He begins with these words, "I beseech you." That's the word paracaleo, which means "to be called alongside." It is the exact same word that's the name of the Holy Spirit, the comforter.
[time=2698] It's used 43 times in the Bible as beseech, but it's used 23 times to mean comfort or encourage.
[time=2706] It's not at all word of demand.
[time=2710] It's not all a word of manipulation. It's a word of gracious appeal.
[time=2718] Most of the times when there are conflicts, our posture is to take off our jackets and to roll up our sleeves,
[time=2725] and with our fist clenched going and saying, "Now listen, buddy." And we wonder why we're greeted with knuckles.
[time=2734] It's because we brought that on.
[time=2738] Conflict is never, ever solved with an escalation of the tension.
[time=2745] Proverbs encourage us to know that a soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.
[time=2756] Learn to appeal softly.
[time=2759] Many of you could go to your employer or to the person that works across from you in the factory
[time=2766] or to the next-door neighbor or to the family member or to the person you're in conflict with.
[time=2771] And if you graciously appealed to them, they'd probably understand how you feel and begin to cooperate.
[time=2781] But we as humans laden everything with such intensity of motions that no one can receive us.
[time=2786] Paul graciously appealed to them.
[time=2791] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that gave it some punch, that gave it some ring of purpose.
[time=2798] It wasn't just for his sake, but for the sake of Christ, he said, "I'm asking you to listen."
[time=2804] He graciously appeals.
[time=2806] And then thirdly, he gives to them a clear solution.
[time=2810] I've discovered something that I have a ministry, a spiritual gift.
[time=2816] My spiritual gift is to discern problems.
[time=2821] I don't have any solutions, but I can walk into your arena and I can tell you all the problems.
[time=2827] I can point out the shortcomings.
[time=2829] I can see the inadequacies.
[time=2831] I can see the inconsistencies between you and your policy.
[time=2838] Why is it that all of us possess that spiritual gift?
[time=2842] Very few of us have the gift of saying, "Can I help?
[time=2847] Can I try?" It doesn't take any real spiritual gift does it, or any wisdom to see mistakes or shortcomings.
[time=2857] Most of us will go home and practice that today as the NFL comes on, and we're sure at 58 years old we could have completed that pass.
[time=2869] I played fourth string quarterback.
[time=2872] I know I could have got the ball there.
[time=2874] My only problem was I couldn't throw it over the center's head to get it out there.
[time=2878] Why do we feel so adequate at doing what the other guy is doing?
[time=2883] We see all their shortcomings, all their problems, but we never have a clear solution.
[time=2889] Paul said, "I've got a clear solution." It sounds so simple that it's almost disappointing.
[time=2897] He said, "Let me ask you to do three things. We'll solve the problem." First of all, he said, "Let me ask you to do this. Agree." It says, "Say the same thing in King James," and that simply means "to agree."
[time=2910] It doesn't mean that we all go into the office, and we put on our matching shirts and our matching ties and our matching jackets,
[time=2919] and we learn the party line, and we come out like a trained parrot, and we begin to squawk whatever we've heard, and we all say the same thing.
[time=2926] That's not what he means by that.
[time=2929] It means that we are united in our testimony.
[time=2934] It means that when we come together and we may have divergence of opinion, this one sees it this way, this one sees it that way,
[time=2942] that when we synthesize all that together, we come to a point of agreement and we stick together,
[time=2948] even if my idea wasn't the one that was adopted.
[time=2954] Occasionally, in maturity, a person must learn to agree, to disagree.
[time=2963] There's a great word that we have lost in the English language. It's the word deference.
[time=2969] Deferance says, "I defer to your thinking. I defer to your wishes. I defer to your insight. I would have rather done this."
[time=2980] But it's your decision. You make it, and I'm going to agree with it, whether it's mine or not.
[time=2987] Most of us find it very easy to agree as long as we get it our way.
[time=2993] I very rarely disagree with one of my own ideas.
[time=2997] Paul says, "Agree." Secondly, he says, "Aliminate divisions. Eliminate it."
[time=3004] He's basically saying this, "There is no issue that is so important that it should divide the unity of the body. There's none."
[time=3015] Some day, I hope that we're able to build an auditorium where the only baskets are the one the ushers carry.
[time=3023] Some day, I hope that we have enough Sunday school space that no one is at the public school across the street and we're busing them back and forth.
[time=3031] Some day, I hope that we won't need to use every room for Sunday school that we can have a biology and chemistry lab for the Christian school where the third graders aren't mixing the chemicals during Sunday school.
[time=3042] I wouldn't those things be great.
[time=3046] But you know, if we never get there, or if we get there, is it nearly as important as that we maintain the unity of the body and the bond of peace?
[time=3058] He says, "Aliminate the divisions. It's that simple. It's that clear."
[time=3065] He simply says, "Let there be no divisions among you."
[time=3071] The absolute darkest chapter of American history was the 1860s, a time that we called the Civil War.
[time=3082] The Serene, Mississippi River that gently meanders like Old Man River was turned into a sea of violences.
[time=3091] Ironclad vessels made their way out of the Bay of New Orleans firing on cities like Vicksburg
[time=3098] when some of the stately cities of the south were burned and looted like New Orleans in Atlanta.
[time=3104] When huge sections of land were destroyed as Sherman marched to the sea, when northern railroads were the targets of attack.
[time=3116] But more tragic in all that is the well, but tragically documented stories of how fathers fought against sons.
[time=3124] Older men in gray uniforms fighting their sons in blue, and how brothers, one for the Confederate and one for the Union, would find themselves firing back and forth across the line.
[time=3138] No war in American history was as consequential, as tragic and as dark as the American Civil War.
[time=3147] Over 360,000 Union soldiers killed by their brothers and 275 Confederates killed by their countrymen, devastating.
[time=3161] It took decades for a nation to begin to move forward again.
[time=3170] There are churches that have gone through their own version of the Civil War.
[time=3178] Paul says, "Don't let it happen. Eliminate divisions." Thirdly, he says, "Be joint together, knit together in the same mind and in the same judgments."
[time=3191] That word "knit together" is for you doctors and nurses and medical people today.
[time=3198] It's actually the word that means to take a bone that is broken and to properly align it so that it can mend together,
[time=3205] or to take a shoulder that is out of joint and to relocate it in its proper function.
[time=3210] He says, "Take all these different people who are out of joint and fit yourselves back together by sharing the same mind
[time=3219] and the same decisions or the same judgments." That means not only come together and agree, and here's where we're going to go, but make sure that your mind and your will is committed to it.
[time=3229] Don't just sit back and say, "Okay, if that's the decision, I'll sit here and watch you do it." But apply your mind and your thinking and come up with a plan and be loyal and committed to that plan as you think it through.
[time=3243] That's his clear solution.
[time=3245] Don't you hate it when you say, "Man, I'm really struggling with this area in my life, and I'm struggling with self-discipline. I just can't get up at six o'clock in the morning like I need to." And someone says, "I've got a solution. Buy an alarm clock, set it for six o'clock, and when it goes off, get out of bed."
[time=3262] You know, there isn't any therapy that's going to help you.
[time=3266] You've just got to do what's right and stop doing what's wrong in the vast majority of the cases.
[time=3273] Paul says, "Here's all you have to do. Stop arguing. Start agreeing. Stop dividing. Start uniting."
[time=3282] But it's clear, and that's what they needed to hear, and so often so do we.
[time=3290] Then after a clear solution, he gives to them what I call a logical reasoning.
[time=3296] It's always helpful when you're trying to deal with a negative situation to not only give the answer,
[time=3303] but to help people understand how you got there.
[time=3307] As parents, one of our full-times jobs is to say no, isn't it?
[time=3313] I find myself saying no to my kids far more often than saying yes.
[time=3318] But if you have to say no, please, don't follow it up with this statement when they ask why.
[time=3325] Because I said so. I don't know of a better way to breed rebellion amongst your children than that.
[time=3335] Equally offensive is the statements like, "As long as I put the bread on the table, we're going to do it my way."
[time=3342] Am I saying that you don't have authority as a parent? No, I exercise it around my house more than I exercise anything else.
[time=3349] But I've learned something. When I tell my kids because I say so, they walk away and bittered.
[time=3354] I want to help them understand why, even if they don't agree, they at least know that it came from a heart of concern.
[time=3361] So Paul says, "Let me give you my reasoning." He said, "I'm not just here to tell you off, but let me help you think through." He says, "Three rhetorical questions. One, is Christ divided?"
[time=3372] The obvious answer, no. Jesus was one, and He was one with God.
[time=3377] Secondly, He said, "Did I die for you?" The answer is no. Only Christ died for you.
[time=3385] Thirdly, He says, "Were you baptized?" Did someone say, "I baptized you in the name of the Apostle Paul."
[time=3391] No. You're baptized in someone's name. It's the person who you belong to.
[time=3398] When we put something legally in someone's name, that means they belong to them.
[time=3402] Paul said, "There's one name that you belong to, and only one." And that's the name that is above every name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3410] That's who you belong to. You don't belong to Paul. You don't belong to Paul. You don't belong to Hawks.
[time=3417] You don't belong to Black Hawk. You belong to Christ. Have you received Him? If not, I pray that you will.
[time=3432] [MUSIC]
