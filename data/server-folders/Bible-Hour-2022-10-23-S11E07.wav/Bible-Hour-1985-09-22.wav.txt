[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=33] [MUSIC - 26 seconds]
[time=62] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=65] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=83] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=86] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=201] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=204] - Almighty God, how wonderful thou art.
[time=208] Week by week is we sing that great hymn, how great thou art.
[time=213] The familiarity only puts within our heart a deeper appreciation for the fact that we've come today to worship God in His greatness, in His majesty, in His transcendence.
[time=224] And we welcome you and thank you for joining us, both here and by way of television as we celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ is alive, that He's our God, and that in Him we live and move and have our being as the Apostle Paul declared.
[time=241] We've discovered in life that Jesus Christ doesn't take all the problems away, but He gives to us a faith to trust Him and a purpose in our life that transcends our problems, gives us a reason to hope and to believe.
[time=254] And so today we've come to worship Him in His greatness.
[time=257] We have a faith in God and our faith in Him holds fast.
[time=261] We've come today not only to celebrate, but to strengthen our faith.
[time=265] Listen as our choir sings of a faith that holds.
[time=268] (piano music)
[time=278] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=485] - There is a part in that second verse
[time=499] that says, "I know not where I'm bound, but I choose "to place my trust in Calvary.
[time=505] "Faith is the victory that overcomes the world.
[time=508] "Let's continue on that theme as we sing together "him number 418.
[time=513] "Faith is the victory, him number 418." (gentle music)
[time=519] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=567] Now the third stands it together.
[time=572] [MUSIC - 82 seconds]
[time=659] - Thank you very much for singing with us
[time=667] and joining together as we worship the Lord through music.
[time=670] We'll continue with music now as Marsha Ives comes to sing about the miracle that can take place in the lives of people that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=680] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=701] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=845] - Again, we want to thank you for joining us today
[time=865] for the Bible Hour.
[time=867] Pete Coby is here as is George Lantman, our minister to senior adults in pastoral care.
[time=872] Good morning, man.
[time=873] - Good morning, Rick.
[time=875] Glad to have you men here to share with the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=878] George is here particularly to talk about a special event coming up on October the 4th, which is the anniversary of Super 60s, right?
[time=886] - Yes, the seventh anniversary.
[time=888] - We're seven years George and Mary, and a great number of volunteers have put on a good ministry to senior adults, and the anniversary is coming and George, give us a little bit of detail about that day.
[time=899] - Yes, we're looking for 700 people in that day, Rick, and we're inviting all the senior adult community of Fort Wayne.
[time=906] We're going to have Don Bartlett there.
[time=908] He's going to be speaking to us.
[time=910] I'm sure that's going to be a great time for people.
[time=913] Also, Stephen Ria Gardner is going to provide the music, so it's going to be a great day.
[time=917] In fact, Mary Moses is coming too, Rick.
[time=920] - Well, I'm looking forward to that day.
[time=922] And many of you who watch the Bible Hour may remember Don Bartlett is an American Indian who came to Christ through a number of physical infirmities he had.
[time=931] He wasn't able to speak, and he had none of their other problems, and a lady who loved Christ loved him and led him to Christ, and now this man who couldn't speak is one of the greatest communicators we've had the privilege of knowing, and he's going to be here.
[time=945] - Yes, he is, Rick.
[time=946] - Well, George, if some of our friends who are senior adults want to come to the anniversary on October the 4th, how can they get here?
[time=953] - Well, Rick, what they can do is call the church, or Super 60s, 749-8524, and we would be glad to have them come and join us.
[time=962] - Let me add to George's remarks, my personal encouragement to you friends who are senior citizens who may not feel like there are that many opportunities for you every Friday, the Super 60s meet, and we want to welcome you, but particularly for this special day, the seventh anniversary on October the 4th.
[time=980] If you'd like to come, please come and join us on October the 4th, we'll be glad to provide transportation if you call us today at 749-8524.
[time=991] Pete, this is the time of year when we intentionally promote timeless insights.
[time=997] We've been talking about timeless insights for about two or three weeks now, encouraging people to write in for the October issue, because that begins the study of the New Testament, Rick, and it's very exciting, but we need to get people into the word right away so that they can chronologically go through the New Testament and their study for the coming year.
[time=1017] - Thank you, Pete.
[time=1018] We do have timeless insights available to you, and I would like to take just a moment to highlight some of the things that are on the inside of timeless insight.
[time=1026] Each day offers to you a study of a chapter or so of the Bible.
[time=1032] On this particular day that I've opened it up to, you'll see that we're studying from Matthew 24.
[time=1037] It's titled Advanced Notice as it talks about the notice that Christ gave that He's coming again.
[time=1044] And then as you read through the timeless insights, it gives you some great applications, a timeless comment by John Calvin to help us understand the passage, and then a timely response, a practical way for each of us to begin obeying God's word.
[time=1059] We want you to have this.
[time=1061] So important is it to us that you have it that will send you your introductory subscription free.
[time=1067] If you'll simply write to us today, Pete, would you tell our friends how they can receive their copy?
[time=1072] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1080] Just ask for timeless insights when you write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1089] Before we go to the live part of our morning worship service again, George, give us one more reminder about the super-60s anniversary.
[time=1097] Yes, I would say this, Rick.
[time=1099] We're going to start at 10 o'clock in the morning, and we'll probably finish about 12, 30 in the morning with a lunch.
[time=1105] And we're just looking forward excitedly to see what's going to happen then when Don Bartlett comes, and also Stephen Maria for the music.
[time=1112] So we're inviting all of Fort Wayne senior adults to come and join us at that time.
[time=1117] Thank you, George and Pete, for working with us today.
[time=1120] Thank you for being a part of the Bible hour.
[time=1122] And we do want to encourage you to take advantage as senior adults of super-60s.
[time=1127] As we go back to our morning worship service, we're looking forward to Dave and Debbie ministering to us on a string instrument that'll bring music that'll praise the Lord, but encourage your heart as well.
[time=1137] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1139] (piano music)
[time=1159] [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=1299] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1307] Thank you, Dave and Debbie and Paul for your accompaniment.
[time=1310] Guide me, O thou great Jehovah.
[time=1313] String instruments can be played with such a majesty and authority that it declares to us even the nature of our God.
[time=1320] That he is a great God, Jehovah, the one who is, the one who had no origin, who is within himself.
[time=1327] He just is Jehovah Yahweh.
[time=1331] But he's the God who is so intimate that he can guide each one of us.
[time=1336] God, we stand in amazement today as we try in a finite way to grasp the infineness of who you are.
[time=1346] Father, we call you Jehovah because we ascribe to you the majesty of self-existence, something we cannot begin to fully grasp.
[time=1356] And yet, Father, we love you today because you are so intimate with us.
[time=1362] Father, as the songwriter declared, we express today how big is God
[time=1368] to rule this mighty universe, yet small enough to live within our hearts.
[time=1375] God, that is amazing to us that we can know you as both.
[time=1380] The power that holds life together.
[time=1385] The universe with its dimensionless nature.
[time=1389] And yet, the fact that you know us today.
[time=1393] You know how many hairs cover my head.
[time=1396] You know the thought that each man is holding his heart.
[time=1399] You know the securities and the insecurities that each woman feels.
[time=1404] God, you know us.
[time=1407] Thank you that you love us.
[time=1409] Father, we have attempted today to bring honor to your name through songs of praise.
[time=1416] And as that song would be played, we are reminded songs of praises, songs of praises I will ever give to thee.
[time=1425] God, we find our fulfillment in praising you.
[time=1428] And even in that, we again have an occasion for thanks.
[time=1432] Father, these are days that are very diverse.
[time=1436] Some of us are on the pinnacle, I for one.
[time=1440] God, thank you for the blessings of everything that Kathy and I and our family have experienced.
[time=1448] We represent so many who know of your goodness.
[time=1451] Many are celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and time together with loved ones.
[time=1456] Joyous reunions.
[time=1458] God, we give thanks and we laugh with those today who are festive.
[time=1463] Yet God, there are others.
[time=1466] Part of this body, who today the laughter is silent because the recent hurts of life have
[time=1473] taken the joy temporarily away.
[time=1476] God, we pray that you would restore to those who have lost children and families,
[time=1482] to those who suffer through physical affliction.
[time=1487] God, we can't even think of all of them.
[time=1490] We pray for them, for Ralph Kramer, for Marvin, for Jack, and Marv Eastlin, for Renee,
[time=1498] for many who fight health problems day in and day out.
[time=1503] We pray for the teemies and the harmons.
[time=1507] Think of the McMacken family.
[time=1509] God, the hurts just multiply.
[time=1512] And yet because you're the great God of the universe, we're trusting you to meet each need.
[time=1518] Father, strengthen the grip of our faith.
[time=1522] As our choir would sing today, God, make it real in our heart that our faith still holds.
[time=1527] Pray you'll strengthen the faith of a single parent who tries to be two people at once
[time=1533] and to do more than one of us can do successfully, even with a partner.
[time=1540] God, strengthen them.
[time=1542] God, strengthen that one in their senior year who is feeling as though life has put them on the shelf and pass them by.
[time=1549] Help them to know that you're there with them and you haven't passed them by.
[time=1554] God, through your word, we want to know who you are in a deeper and richer way.
[time=1560] So we ask you to reveal yourself to us today in Jesus' name.
[time=1566] [AMEN] A half a generation ago, a man by the name of Bertrand Russell wrote a book with this title.
[time=1579] Why?
[time=1580] I am not a Christian.
[time=1582] In that book, he only represents one of dozens of writers and thinkers of this age and of
[time=1590] others who attack the credibility of the gospel message.
[time=1598] Most of us here today in this auditorium, and many of you who are watching by way of television, have accepted the gospel message of Jesus Christ.
[time=1608] There may be those here today and we welcome you today if you are skeptical or still unpersuaded.
[time=1614] You're welcome today.
[time=1615] We're thankful that you would give us this audience.
[time=1619] The basic question is one of credibility.
[time=1623] Is the Bible credible?
[time=1626] Can we believe its historical records?
[time=1630] The question of credibility comes from a different basis.
[time=1635] Is it credible to believe that one man was actually God?
[time=1641] That Jesus was somehow human in God?
[time=1644] Is that actually credible?
[time=1647] Another whole approach to credibility is the credibility of results.
[time=1653] Is it really credible that Jesus Christ is God based upon the life of those who claim
[time=1660] is God in their life?
[time=1663] Is it really credible?
[time=1665] That was one area of attack that Russell in particular would make.
[time=1671] Is the message of Jesus Christ credible?
[time=1676] Last week, a friend dropped off a book and I began to peruse it.
[time=1680] It was a listing of the 100 most influential people of history.
[time=1687] In it, it said this that Jesus Christ would have been the most influential person in history
[time=1693] had his followers done what they claimed they were going to do and had they followed his teaching.
[time=1700] Is the gospel of Jesus Christ credible?
[time=1705] That is the message that the Apostle Paul answers for us in 1 Corinthians 1 beginning at verse 18.
[time=1716] Each of us are looking for a faith that will make sense out of life.
[time=1723] Something that will give to life a sense of purpose.
[time=1727] The philosopher says, "Why am I here?
[time=1730] How did I get here?
[time=1732] Where am I going?" The songwriter says, "What's it all about, Alfie?" The rock group says, "We're dust in the wind.
[time=1741] All we are is dust in the wind." And so we're looking for something that gives incredible meaning to life.
[time=1750] We're looking for something that gives ethos, as the Greeks would say, an ethical perspective to life.
[time=1758] How do we live?
[time=1760] What values are those values that are the truth, the good, the noble, the just?
[time=1766] Socrates would ask.
[time=1771] I put it into today's world's philosophy.
[time=1775] How do I raise my kids?
[time=1778] And how can I get them from the time that they're one years old and we're desperately teaching them to walk and talk to the time for the next 17 years?
[time=1788] We're trying to get them to sit down and shut up.
[time=1791] Isn't that a paradox in life?
[time=1796] And how do we raise those children that God has privileged us with?
[time=1800] What ethical values are there that are credible?
[time=1806] How do you begin to order a world?
[time=1809] Each of us read the newspaper and we've become aware of the state of nations in our own and we say, "How do you govern the world?"
[time=1822] And is Jesus Christ really credible?
[time=1827] As Paul would speak to the Church of Corinth, he was speaking to the intelligentsia of that day.
[time=1835] The Greek mind has yet to be rivaled even in today's western world.
[time=1842] Their concepts of philosophy were so profound that they have not been improved upon to this day.
[time=1850] These were no fools. These were no simpletons. These were men with keen minds who were asking the message of credibility.
[time=1859] I believe beginning in verse 18 of chapter 1, Paul is going to answer three questions for them about the credibility of the gospel.
[time=1869] One attack of credibility is this, if the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, why is it then not more widely accepted?
[time=1879] I mean, if Jesus Christ is indeed God, his message is true, then why hasn't the world by and large recognized that and received it?
[time=1890] There's a second question. Not only one of unifersality but one of particularalities.
[time=1898] Why is it that if the gospel of Jesus Christ is true that few of the world's leaders, in business, in science, education, and in government,
[time=1908] why is it that few of those leaders believe on the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[time=1917] And the third question is this, if it is true, why did God choose the plan that he chose, if it seems so universally and particularly unreceived?
[time=1932] I believe that's what Paul is trying to address. This passage is many of Paul's are very philosophical. The grammatical structure is not at all simple, nor is the reasoning that goes behind it.
[time=1945] So we're going to study and we're going to look at some philosophical things today, but I just want to assure you that early in life I learned a management style called kiss.
[time=1956] It stands for keep it simple, stupid. I'm not smart enough to make this real complicated. Let's try to make it simple for people like me.
[time=1965] Verse 18, Paul writes, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to unto us who are saved it is the power of God.
[time=1980] For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
[time=1990] Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the dispute of this age?
[time=1998] Have not God made the foolishness, the wisdom of this world? For after that in wisdom, the world by wisdom knew not God.
[time=2011] It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
[time=2018] For the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified under the Jews' stumbling block and unto the Greek foolishness.
[time=2034] But unto them that believe who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[time=2044] Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God stronger than men.
[time=2051] For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.
[time=2060] But God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise.
[time=2065] And God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things which are mighty.
[time=2071] And the base things of the world, the things which are despised, have God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to not the things that are.
[time=2082] That no flesh should glory in his presence.
[time=2088] But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written.
[time=2101] He that glories let him glory in the Lord.
[time=2106] Paul was speaking very philosophical because he is speaking to a group of philosophically minded people.
[time=2113] In verse 17, where we concluded last week, he brings back to the fact that central to the purpose of his life in ministry is one thing.
[time=2122] And that is Jesus Christ proclaiming him as crucified Lord and Savior.
[time=2129] And now he begins to try to relate the crucified Christ to the world of the Corinthians.
[time=2137] The Corinthians were part of the Greek culture.
[time=2140] Many pre-socratic Greek philosophers came up with concepts that are astounding today, concepts of a democratic government, concepts of an atomic theory
[time=2151] of matter, concepts of evolution.
[time=2155] Be we hold them true or false, I hold them false, we have to be amazed at their thoroughness of insight into the specifications of animal life.
[time=2165] And this all happened before Socrates, nearly 400 years before Christ.
[time=2171] And then there were Socrates and Plato, Aristotle.
[time=2176] And out of this tradition came the sophists, the rhetoricitians who could make everything so reasonably sound good that even what you believed to be false, you began to think was true.
[time=2188] They could make white look black and black look white and dark look light, intelligent people, gifted in the wisdom of humanity.
[time=2198] And Paul begins to address why it is that these people and our people today do not more widely receive Christ.
[time=2208] Let me share with you at least these five insights out of what Paul has written.
[time=2212] First of all, it is because the gospel appears to be foolishness to the human mind.
[time=2225] The word for foolish there is the word moron, both in Greek and in English.
[time=2231] I like the word absurd. To the Greek mind it makes no sense that the God of the universe, the Lord of creation was actually an obscure Jew who died in a town that they had never heard of before.
[time=2251] And that somehow his death was significant for all of creation. They said that's absurd. That's ludicrous. That's unthinkable.
[time=2263] And the gospel, because of its simplistic nature, appears to be foolishness.
[time=2270] Well, why does the Bible and the gospel message appear to be foolishness? I believe Paul answers in verses 19 and 20.
[time=2278] It is because secondly, God's wisdom is far superior to human wisdom, and we are not even on the same wavelength.
[time=2289] Please don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say today. I am not at all trying to depreciate human wisdom.
[time=2297] I am thankful for the times in which you and I live, that we can pick up a telephone and we can literally call around the world,
[time=2305] that we can send up a satellite and you and I can watch world events take place live from anywhere in the globe.
[time=2313] We live in the time that if you need open heart surgery today, it's not only available, but there's a 90 percent or better chance that you're going to come through that, a stronger, healthier person.
[time=2325] We live in an amazing time. It has been well documented that in the last ten years, the knowledge that we possess has doubled.
[time=2338] That we have learned more in the last ten years than all of history before us.
[time=2344] If you are a scientist or an engineer and you retreated from your work and made it your job to simply read the journals that are available for you,
[time=2354] that if you began reading them, at the end of a year, you would be one year behind.
[time=2361] There's more information available than a human can comprehend.
[time=2365] As a matter of fact, there are so many books that are written that in 24 hours around this world, there are more things published than you can read in your lifetime.
[time=2380] We live in a time that is an explosion of knowledge and we're the beneficiaries of all that and it's fantastic.
[time=2387] However, all that we know exist on a plane, the highest point of which will never begin to approach the wisdom of God.
[time=2400] We're not on the same wavelength. Most of you are parents. Many of you have had little children.
[time=2411] They can ask the most aggravating of questions. At two years old, their early questions are repetitions of why.
[time=2426] Why does the sun come up? Then you try to explain to them the fact that the earth turns and the sun doesn't come up and they go, "Why?"
[time=2439] You're not on the same wavelength. I find it so difficult to explain things that I barely understand myself to my kids because we're not on the same wavelength.
[time=2457] God says, "I've given you the gift of knowledge and wisdom, but even all that you possess were not on the same wavelength."
[time=2465] That's what verse 19 is saying. It says that God completely overshadows. His wisdom brings all of our wisdom to nothing and all that we know is not even a thimble for all in the ocean of information that God has.
[time=2479] He says, "Where's the wise man? Who's going to stand next to God? Where's the scribe? The person who knows all the details? Do they know all God knows?
[time=2489] Where's the dispute? Who's going to debate with God?" His point is this. God completely overshadows everything that we know.
[time=2499] Albert Einstein said this, "Our knowledge is but the knowledge of a school child. Do you think that we shall ever probe the secrets? Possibly we shall know more than we know now, but we will never know the real nature of things.
[time=2518] We will never know." That comes from one of the most brilliant minds that we have ever been exposed to. The reality that God overshadows everything.
[time=2530] There's a cute little story told about a man who survived the famous Johnstown flood. The whole city was wiped out and he was one of the few survivors. When he later died and went to heaven, he said, "Peter, I survived the Johnstown flood, and I'd sure like to have an opportunity to tell people about it." Peter said, "We'll give you a chance sometime." Again and again, the man came to Peter and said, "When's my chance to speak? Come on, Peter, when's my chance?" This went on and on.
[time=2556] Finally, Peter said, "What is it you want to talk about?" He said, "I survived the Johnstown flood." Peter said, "We got a spot for you. You're on right after Noah." Isn't amazing how we really think we've got something and then it's completely overshadowed.
[time=2575] One of my more embarrassing moments in life was as a senior in high school. I had spent four years in competitive swimming and I wasn't bad. I certainly didn't gain world recognition. I didn't gain home street recognition, but I could swim pretty fast.
[time=2591] My mother who could barely make it across the pool, one day the neighborhood swimming pool and she said, "Let's race." I said, "Let's race."
[time=2604] And suddenly I began to realize something. I thought I was really good. And you know what? Nobody recognized it. Nobody recognized it.
[time=2619] Sometimes we really think we've got something, but it goes unrecognized. The best thing that we've got compared to all the God is, he doesn't even recognize it.
[time=2631] And that's not a put down that's saying we've got a lot, but compared to God we're not even on the same wavelength.
[time=2641] When you take the scale of what God knows, it goes on forever. And what we know is not even a recognizable spot on the scale.
[time=2655] And what we're trying to do is we're trying to take our finite minds and we're trying to limit an infinite God and say, "God, here's the blueprint. Here's how I think it should work."
[time=2667] And God says, "No, I'm God. I'll make the blueprint. And if we're ever going to find God, it'll be on His terms."
[time=2677] Thirdly, Paul says this. One, the gospel peers as foolishness. Two, it appears that way because God's thoughts are higher than ours.
[time=2687] One, the same wavelength. And three, for that reason, man's wisdom will never lead us to God. Verse 21 says this.
[time=2699] Four, after that, by wisdom, man knew not God. Wisdom will never lead us to God.
[time=2710] One of the darkest hours in the history of theology was the life of St. Thomas Aquinas, a brilliant man, but a man who took a concept and introduced it into theology and that it has misdirected all of history.
[time=2727] For St. Thomas said that when man sinned in the garden and fell, he fell spiritually, but his mind never fell, and his mind could reason its way to God, and therefore man's wisdom can reason to God, and it cannot.
[time=2743] Our wisdom will never lead us to God. Fourthly, Paul says, for that matter, just like the Greek seek for wisdom, the Jews seek for a sign, and spiritual power will also, in its divine manifestation, never lead anyone to God.
[time=2764] Human wisdom can't lead to God, nor can a supernatural demonstration of God's power.
[time=2772] The Jews wanted philosophy that they could reason through, and the Greeks wanted a supernatural demonstration, a sign, a miracle.
[time=2783] But you see, a sign will never lead anyone to God either. Jesus said there was a man who died and he went to hell, and as he was in hell, he asked God to allow him to go back to earth to warn his brothers, lest they end up in the same torment.
[time=2800] And the answer God gave was this, they have Moses and the prophets, and if they didn't believe Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe though one rise from the dead.
[time=2815] If supernatural signs would lead people to accept Christ, then Jesus Christ would have been crowned as king of the world over 1900 years ago instead of crucified.
[time=2826] But as a matter of fact, it was his miracles that caused his rejection.
[time=2831] In John chapter 11, Jesus performed the miracles of miracles, and that is raising Lazarus from the dead, and instead of people saying, "He is the Messiah," they said, "We've got to kill him."
[time=2846] He's breaking all the rules. He's messing up the system. We've got to eliminate him.
[time=2854] Supernatural signs don't lead people to God. Human wisdom doesn't lead people to God.
[time=2865] The final thing Paul says in these first verses is this, "Only the cross of Jesus Christ can bring people to God."
[time=2875] Verse 23, "But we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews, a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks, foolishness."
[time=2886] To the Jews, they wanted a Messiah who would be crowned and reigned and conquer the world, and it was totally, totally repugnant to them that a Messiah would be crucified at the hands of Gentiles.
[time=2902] To them that was a stumbling block, the Greek word is "scandalon," scandalous in English.
[time=2908] They said it's absolutely scandalous to think that our Messiah could be crucified and killed. It was an obstacle that was insurmountable to them.
[time=2918] And to the Greeks, it was absurdity. The death, the igneous death of a Jew somehow, the solution to the world's purpose in life, they couldn't accept it.
[time=2935] It was foolishness to them. But Paul says this, "But unto those of us who have received Christ, who have been called, that Jesus Christ gives us everything,
[time=2946] that Jews in the Greeks have been looking for, that in Christ we have wisdom, and in Christ we have power."
[time=2955] Please don't misunderstand. I'm not saying here that if you receive Jesus Christ as Savior, God's going to give you wisdom, and you who are in college don't need to study for your Calculus exam, God will give you wisdom.
[time=2966] I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that you'll understand Greek if you accept Christ. I've taken four years of Greek, and I don't understand it.
[time=2975] What it is saying simply is this that when you receive Christ, you now have the mind of Christ, and you begin to understand that level of wisdom that is above and beyond human wisdom, you begin to understand the spiritual things that God has, as you never understood them before.
[time=2992] One of the most refreshing experiences in life is to be around someone who has received Christ as Savior, and to hear some of their reports.
[time=2999] A man said, "I've dabbled with the Bible here and there, and it never made sense, but since I've received Christ as my Savior, the Bible has come alive. I can't get enough of it."
[time=3009] That's because when Christ comes into you, you now have the wisdom, the mind of Christ by the Spirit of God, and it opens up to you, the ability to understand that which you've never understood before, the spiritual dimension of life.
[time=3021] And it gives you power, power to please God. Why is it that so few people accept the gospel of Jesus Christ? I mean, if it's true, if it's credible, shouldn't they be coming to it and mass?
[time=3037] You would think they would, but Paul says no, because one, it appears foolishness to them. Why is that? Two, because God's wisdom is above that.
[time=3048] Three, human wisdom will never lead to God. Four, nor were supernatural power being demonstrated. And five, only the cross of Jesus Christ can bring someone to God, only the cross.
[time=3066] That raises another question though, Paul anticipates. Well, even if the majority of people don't see it, why is it that the gospel, if it's true and credible, is not more widely received by the educated, the scientific, the scholars, the leaders?
[time=3083] So Paul addresses that in verse 26. Very quickly, let me give you three responses of Paul's. First of all, he says this, "As long as we seek God on our terms, we'll never find Him."
[time=3096] He says this, "The wise man seeks God through wisdom, the mighty man seeks God through power, and the noble man seeks God through his nobility, and God's taken, and the wisdom of man, and he's confounded by the simplicity of the gospel."
[time=3111] God's taken the simple weakness of a death of a carpenter and given it the power to change the world. And he's taken a man born in the obscure town of Bethlehem, raised in the even more obscure Nazareths, a nobody, a have-not.
[time=3129] And by him, confounded all the nobility of the world. We'll never find God seeking Him on our terms. It must be His. But secondly, Paul says, notice this.
[time=3144] And remember this. Paul says, "Not that none of them believe." He says, "It's just not many of them." One lady, a noble one of Europe said, "I'm so thankful for that little letter M, that it doesn't say not any noble."
[time=3162] It doesn't say that none. It just says there won't be many.
[time=3167] In a radio interview, a man who I would call my pastor was asked, "Why is it that so few of the wealthy and so few of the educated don't believe?" His answer was simple but yet profound.
[time=3181] The more a man earns and the more a man learns, the easier it is from the trust in himself and fail to see his need for God.
[time=3192] That's why there aren't many noble. But you know, there are some. And there's a whole group of men called Creation Science Research.
[time=3201] By the thousands, professors in Christian and in secular universities alike who say, "We believe the message of the Bible is credible. We believe Genesis 1 is credible."
[time=3213] It is received by the intelligence. There are leaders in our world today. Our Congressman Dan Coates gives a clear testimony that he believes in Christ.
[time=3223] It's just that there aren't many, but there are some. Thirdly, Paul says, "The reason why God is chosen to take the simplest message in verse 29 is this, so that no one can boast in his sight."
[time=3237] Old stories told about a man who had several servants. The one servant obviously had a joy that God gave him that the owner did not.
[time=3246] The owner asked the servant how he could have that joy and the servant said, "You've got to go out master into that pigpin that I clean every day and you've got to kneel down and ask God to forgive you."
[time=3257] The owner became indignant at such a suggestion. Time went on and he asked the same question. He was given the same answer.
[time=3266] Finally, the wealthy man came to a servant and said, "I'm ready to go to the pigpin." The servant said, "You don't have to go to the pigpin, but you do have to be willing."
[time=3279] You know, there's a pigpin that you and I have to go to. The mire that you and I must kneel down into is the mire of our own sin.
[time=3288] You see, for us to say, "God, I want you to be my savior. We first have to admit our sinfulness." To say, "God, I need you. We first have to admit our own inadequacies."
[time=3300] And we've read Mark Twain's "The Self-Reliant." We've been raised in a Western culture that says, "Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Don't need anyone."
[time=3309] And it's humbling to say, "I need God." It's humbling to say, "I'm a sinner."
[time=3315] No, you don't have to go to a pigpin, but you must admit your sinfulness before God.
[time=3320] And God says, "No one's going to boast and say, "I came here by my wisdom. Well, I came here by my might."
[time=3326] No one will glory in his presence because no one will come to him but by his plan and that is Christ.
[time=3333] The tragedy is there are many here today, many watching by way of television who know they need Christ.
[time=3341] They know that his message is credible, but they won't humble themselves and receive him.
[time=3346] You must humble yourself and receive him.
[time=3351] Finally, Paul answers this third question. Why is God chosen this plan?
[time=3357] Quite simply, he says this, "Because in the cross of Christ, that's how God can give us the most."
[time=3363] Verse 30 says that God can give us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and freedom or redemption.
[time=3372] Through Christ, that's the only way he could do it so he has this plan that he could give us the most.
[time=3377] And finally, he has this plan, as verse 31 says, because that's what gives him the most glory.
[time=3383] What is the purpose of man? In a fine document that's a synthesis of many scriptures,
[time=3390] the shorter catechism of the Westminster Confession says this, "The chief duty of human life is to glorify God." God says, "I want you to glorify me.
[time=3401] And the way you can glorify me is to come to me through my Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the cross on which he died."
[time=3409] What's the purpose of your life?
[time=3411] God's made you to bring him glory.
[time=3413] Are you bringing glory?
[time=3415] You cannot do that apart from his Son.
[time=3418] Receive him today.
[time=3420] Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[time=3444] I trust that today as you watch the Bible hour that you received a blessing from the Lord.
[time=3449] We had special music from our regular attenders here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, and our message is from our pastor Rick Hawks.
