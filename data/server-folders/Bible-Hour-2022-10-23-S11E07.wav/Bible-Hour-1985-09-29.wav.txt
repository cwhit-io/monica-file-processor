[time=83] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible app.
[time=86] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=91] It's the Bible hour with inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists.
[time=98] And a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=103] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=106] [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=203] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=206] It's our privilege today to sing how great Thou art and to listen as our choir refrains the God, how mighty,
[time=216] how wonderful Thou art.
[time=218] Our privilege to listen, to sing, and to study the scriptures.
[time=221] We're delighted that you're here and trust that within each heart today, there's a spirit of expectancy that you're looking forward to worshiping the Lord together.
[time=231] We also want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible hour.
[time=235] The privilege of ours is to declare Christ.
[time=238] When we think of all that He's done for us, He died on the cross for our sins.
[time=243] He's come into our hearts, He's given us new life.
[time=246] What is it that we can do?
[time=248] Well, giving Him praise is at least the least that we can do.
[time=254] Listen now as our choir and Marsha, I have sing for us that giving praise is the least that we can do.
[time=268] Lord, I'm amazed at Your might and Your mercy
[time=282] and all of the works that You do.
[time=292] What sacrifice can I bring but my praises
[time=301] that will be pleasing to You?
[time=311] Praise, it's the least I can do.
[time=320] I lift up my voice and I feel the song starting our praise.
[time=332] It's the least I can do, oh Lord, but it's the most perfect song in my heart.
[time=350] Sweet, alleluia, as I sing in Your presence with joy for Your goodness and grace.
[time=369] Glory and honor I love her before You till some day we meet face to face.
[time=389] Praise, it's the least I can do.
[time=399] I lift up my voice and I feel the song starting our praise.
[time=411] It's the least I can do, oh Lord, but it's the most perfect song in my heart.
[time=430] All I possess are the blessings You give, and all is a gift from Your hand.
[time=450] And even this grace that flows out of my life was good there by You.
[time=464] So what else can I do, oh Lord, praise, it's the least I can do.
[time=480] I lift up my voice and I feel the song starting our praise.
[time=496] It's the least I can do, oh Lord, but it's the most perfect song in my heart.
[time=513] Oh praise, it's the least I can do, oh Lord, I lift up my voice and I feel the song starting
[time=534] our praise, it's the least I can do, oh Lord, and for as long as I live, Lord, my grace
[time=551] I will give all Lord, it's the least I can do, it's the least I can do, my grace is for
[time=573] You.
[time=592] Question is often asked by young and old alike, what can we do to pay back?
[time=597] Certainly there isn't anything that we can do in paying back the Lord for our salvation, but we can give Him our honor and our praise.
[time=604] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me, a familiar hymn, let's
[time=610] sing it together, it's hymn number 187, 187 we'll sing the first, second, third and sixth
[time=618] stanzas together.
[time=633] Oh Lord, it's the least I can do, it's the least I can do, it's the least I can do,
[time=1021] [MUSIC]
[time=1026] (audience applauding)
[time=1033] - Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1039] We sincerely are praying that God will use this ministry through television to make Jesus Christ alive and real to you.
[time=1048] As we share the word of God in music each week, we are hoping that it impresses your heart that you can have a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=1056] And yet as sincere as we are, we know that you need more than simply one hour a week with us.
[time=1062] We know that each of us, as believers in Christ, need a daily time of walking through the word of God with our Savior.
[time=1069] And that's why we want to share this booklet with you entitled "Timeless Insights." We've shared this with you often.
[time=1076] This particular month of September, we are especially encouraging our viewers to write in for timeless insight.
[time=1084] It is an excellent daily devotional tool that by using it, you will be reading through the entire New Testament over one year.
[time=1092] The year begins October the 1st.
[time=1094] And so we during September are encouraging you to write to us four timeless insights.
[time=1100] We want to send it to you to help you to begin reading the word of God on your own.
[time=1105] If you'd like to receive your first free complimentary issue, simply write to us at the Bible hour.
[time=1112] Our address is the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1121] Once again, our address is the Bible hour box 15,000,
[time=1127] 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1135] Please do write to us so that we can send you a copy of this and you can begin in the book of Matthew with us just as soon as possible.
[time=1142] Obviously, being September the 29th, we won't be able to get your letter, process it, and get it back to you in two days.
[time=1149] But we'll get it to you as quickly as we can so that you can begin to study the New Testament with us.
[time=1155] With me today is my friend and co-pastor George Lantman, who is in the number of areas of our church, pastoral care, but particularly Super 60s.
[time=1163] Good morning, George.
[time=1164] Good morning, Rick.
[time=1165] This is the big event of Super 60s this week.
[time=1168] Tell our friends a little about it.
[time=1170] All right, I certainly will.
[time=1171] Rick, this is a seventh anniversary of Super 60s.
[time=1174] It was started in 1978.
[time=1178] And we're expecting 700 people here this Friday, October the 4th at 10 o'clock.
[time=1184] And it's going to be an exciting time.
[time=1186] I would like to invite all the people in the Fort Wayne area, all the senior adults, 55 to 105, we say.
[time=1194] But it's a little older than come, too, Rick.
[time=1196] And we have an exciting program, I think.
[time=1199] We've got Dr. Don Bartlett.
[time=1202] And he's an Indian, as you know.
[time=1203] And he's got a real story to tell.
[time=1206] And then along with that, we have Stephen Maria.
[time=1208] So we're going to have a great time there.
[time=1210] And we're going to have some dignitaries come from the town, too, the city, and also maybe some from Washington.
[time=1216] Well, that's great.
[time=1217] Many of you who watch the Bible, or may remember, Don Bartlett.
[time=1221] Don is an American Indian, born with a number of speech impediments.
[time=1226] And he overcame that with the assistance of a godly Christian woman who led him to Christ.
[time=1231] Now he has a doctorate degree.
[time=1233] And it was one of the great communicators of this part of the country.
[time=1236] And he'll be here for supers on Friday morning.
[time=1239] Give our friends the time and how they can get here.
[time=1242] Yes, I ought to give the phone number, shouldn't I?
[time=1244] All right, the time is 10 o'clock in the morning.
[time=1247] And it's October the 4th.
[time=1248] This is coming Friday at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[time=1252] And if they need transportation, they should call 749-8524.
[time=1257] So you come, bring your friends, and expect a great time.
[time=1261] This Friday at 10 o'clock, October the 4th.
[time=1264] Thank you, George.
[time=1265] We do hope that you can join us for Super 60s on Friday.
[time=1268] If you're a part of the senior adult community, we'd love for you to be here.
[time=1272] Please do call us, and we'll be glad to help with transportation if you need that.
[time=1276] Along with being here for Super 60s anniversary, Don Bartlett will be with us next Sunday morning here at Black Hawk to speak in our morning services.
[time=1285] So those of you under 55 won't be getting cheated out of a good opportunity.
[time=1289] You'll be able to see him and hear him by either joining us for the Bible or coming here to Black Hawk.
[time=1295] We want to encourage you to be attending church.
[time=1297] If you're going to church and watching this television afterwards, that's great.
[time=1302] If you're not able to get out, that's why we're here.
[time=1305] But if you can go to church, we want to encourage you to do that and invite you to join us, not only next Sunday, but every Sunday.
[time=1313] Tonight at six o'clock in our evening service, we're going to have a good time as a family.
[time=1317] Most of the night will be a sing-spiration.
[time=1319] I'll be teaching for a little bit.
[time=1321] Then we'll be singing and our people bringing in desserts.
[time=1324] We'd love to have you come.
[time=1325] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1327] May God bless you.

[time=1474] - Thank you, Scott.
[time=1475] That piano rendition of "UnChrist the Solid Rock I Stand."
[time=1481] All other ground is sinking sand.
[time=1484] I dare not trust the sweetest fame, but holy lean on Jesus' name.
[time=1491] God today, we do lean on the name of Jesus.
[time=1495] Our blessed Messiah, Mighty King.
[time=1499] God, we worship you today through Jesus Christ.
[time=1503] And we thank you that He has given us access to you.
[time=1507] God, we are aware of our own sin, our own shortcoming, our own disobedience, our own apathetic ignoring of you.
[time=1516] God, we today are aware that all of that's been forgiven in Christ.
[time=1522] You are the Mighty King.
[time=1524] Lord Jesus, we've come to worship you and to magnify your name.
[time=1528] And to glorify you that in lifting up your name, glory might go to God the Father.
[time=1534] Thank you for the privilege that's been ours to sing.
[time=1538] To sing joyful, joyful, we adore the.
[time=1541] God, we adore you in response to the love that you initiated towards us.
[time=1547] To be able to sing how great thou art and to reflect on not only your control over the universe, but the fact that you care about us.
[time=1556] God, it's been a joy for us to sing amazing grace.
[time=1560] The sound is sweet to our ears that you have forgiven.
[time=1565] Thank you, Father, for Scott's reminder in a song that every philosophy that we build, every religion that we construct, every system that we arrange is but sinking sand.
[time=1578] And there is no rock that we can stand on, except for Christ.
[time=1583] And Father, as we encounter the storms of life, we thank you for a rock that is our foundation.
[time=1593] Thank you that Jesus Christ can give a woman the strength to endure a divorce that she didn't want, rejection that she received.
[time=1602] Thank you that your grace gives a single parent the ability to take care of children, manage your house and supply income that I can't begin to imagine how they do it all.
[time=1614] But thank you for your amazing grace that strengthens them.
[time=1618] God, thank you for your grace that helps those who have lost loved ones to go on with life and the know of its purpose.
[time=1628] Thank you for your grace that helps us to trust you when the hurts of life seems so enormous.
[time=1635] God, by your grace, we today pray that you would comfort.
[time=1638] Joy should learn her family.
[time=1641] We rejoice that slim is with the Lord, but the loss that these loved ones hold.
[time=1646] God, for them are hearts.
[time=1648] We pray comfort and grace.
[time=1651] We pray for Scott and Angie Weaver, for their parents, Wayne and Marianne and their family, that your grace would comfort them in the loss of a child born prematurely, born tragically.
[time=1665] God, by your grace, uphold them.
[time=1668] God, we pray today for those whose health is uncertain, for those who've had surgery.
[time=1676] Think of Fran Haines, Harry Blossard.
[time=1681] Think of Kathryn Northrup.
[time=1684] God, there's a body of people here that carry some silent hurts that they've never shared with someone else.
[time=1692] Give the grace and the strength we pray to endure, to hang on, to persevere, and to keep going.
[time=1701] God, today, as we stop and take an inventory of our lives, we want to do the least that we can do.
[time=1709] We want to give you praise.
[time=1711] And we recognize that we have much.
[time=1714] You've given us this fine body of people who serve one another enthusiastically and lovingly.
[time=1720] Thank you for the tribe of people who are like a fierce war party relentless in their pursuit of God.
[time=1729] God, keep our ambition pure and our motive keen.
[time=1733] We want to glorify you.
[time=1735] We do not want to build an institution, an organization.
[time=1740] But God, we do hunger to build people whose lives are lighthouses, sharing the light of Christ.
[time=1747] God put within our hearts a keen burden to honor you and to honor people by sharing Christ.
[time=1756] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1760] For the eight years that it's been my privilege of being here at Blackhawk, one of my particular privileges has been to teach a class that we call vangelism explosion.
[time=1773] I have literally lost track of how many times I've taught the course.
[time=1778] It started off with junior hires and high schoolers.
[time=1781] Then it went to college, adults.
[time=1783] We had a daytime class, an evening class, a spring class, and a fall class.
[time=1787] I've lost track of how many times I've been through the syllabus in the book.
[time=1793] But yet there are some things that haven't grown thin with repetitions.
[time=1800] As a matter of fact, there are two quotes in the very first pages of our manual that every time I read them, point right at my own heart.
[time=1811] And I sense it yours.
[time=1813] Some of you who've been through that class with us know the quotes.
[time=1817] It'll be a good reminder for you.
[time=1819] For others, it will be a first and important first.
[time=1825] Let me just share two statements with you that grip me every time.
[time=1831] The first is this statistic, over 95% of all Christians.
[time=1838] That is over 95% of us who believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins, who believe an individual must receive him to be born again.
[time=1849] Over 95% of us have never led anyone else to Christ.
[time=1856] Over 95% of us.
[time=1864] There are probably 600 people in this auditorium right now.
[time=1867] The auditorium in the last hour, hundreds again.
[time=1870] But out of all those hundreds and hundreds of people, only a handful, have ever led someone else to Christ.
[time=1881] A second quote comes from a man by the name of W.E.
[time=1885] Sankster.
[time=1888] He said there are two questions that will embarrass the average congregation and the average Christian.
[time=1895] The two questions are, one, when was the last time you led someone to Christ?
[time=1903] Second question is, when was the last time you tried?
[time=1910] The hours turn in the days and the days turn in the weeks,
[time=1917] don't they, as we start to go back through a mental diary.
[time=1922] For some, it's been months.
[time=1923] Others, it's been years.
[time=1925] And some, there's no entry in the diary.
[time=1930] There's no entry.
[time=1932] Well, talking with one of our teachers, we were trying to address why it is that so few people really share Christ.
[time=1941] The teacher said, well, it comes down to one of two things.
[time=1943] They're either hung up on the one two or hung up on the how two.
[time=1948] It's really true, isn't it?
[time=1949] We either hung up on the one two that we really don't want to.
[time=1953] We're afraid we're intimidated.
[time=1955] We fear rejection.
[time=1957] We might be misunderstood or crossed off a list.
[time=1961] We really don't want to.
[time=1963] Or more often, it's not so much the one two, but it's the how two.
[time=1968] I don't know what I'd say.
[time=1969] I mean, if somebody came up to me and wanted to talk about it, I don't know what to say.
[time=1973] And if I did know what to say, they'd ask some question and I wouldn't know the answer to, and I'm just not-- I don't know what to say.
[time=1981] I just don't know what to say.
[time=1984] You know, I've discovered as I've studied through 1 Corinthians this week that doesn't matter whether you know what to say or not.
[time=1992] Sharing Christ is so simple.
[time=1995] It almost falls out of our lips, trickles out of our mouth.
[time=2000] Open your Bibles to study with us this morning from 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verses 1 through 5.
[time=2008] Now we get hung up on the how-to's and having all the information, the wisdom, the skill to say it just right, one of the greatest evangelists that this country has ever known, perhaps the world has ever known, was neither educated or capable of speaking the King's English with any sense of refinement.
[time=2030] He was a shoe salesman, never finished high school, to my knowledge, but he was one of the most effective evangelists of all times, one-on-one and in a crowd of thousands.
[time=2043] His name was D.L. Moody, and Moody was so incapable
[time=2049] with the King's English that someone said he was the only man that they knew who could pronounce Jerusalem in one syllable.
[time=2057] Moody finished speaking and he was standing at the back of an auditorium and a lady came out a little bit infuriated and she said, "Mr. Moody, do you know that you had 27 different grammatical mistakes in your message today?" He said, "My dear woman, you're too kind, I'm sure there were more than that." And yet this man was one of the greatest witnesses for Christ will ever have the privilege of studying about,
[time=2093] but he wasn't educated, he wasn't wise, and he certainly wasn't eloquent.
[time=2099] He wasn't like a George Whitfield who Jonathan Edwards says, "When Whitfield says the word Mesopotamia, people begin to cry." That wasn't Moody, if they cried it was for the wrong reason.
[time=2115] And yet God used him.
[time=2118] How can God use somebody so simple as that?
[time=2122] I think Paul gives us a clue right here, chapter two of first Corinthians.
[time=2126] He writes, "And I brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellence of speech or of wisdom,
[time=2141] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[time=2146] For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[time=2157] And I was with you in weakness and in fear
[time=2163] and in much trembling.
[time=2166] And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
[time=2189] Let me try to boil down what Paul was saying about having away with words into three simple statements.
[time=2197] Each of us would love to have away with words so that as we share Christ with people, it just kind of like falls out of our mouth.
[time=2206] It just comes as natural as walking and chewing gum at the same time, having away with words.
[time=2215] Trying to synthesize all that Paul has said in these five verses, I'd like to bring him down into three statements that we can try to get a hold of, try to live by.
[time=2226] First Paul said, "I shared Christ simply." Let that be the first lesson, that we share Christ simply.
[time=2235] Paul simply presented Christ.
[time=2239] Look at the first two verses, and he'll elaborate on that concept.
[time=2242] He says, "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellence of speech or of wisdom.
[time=2249] If you want to impress people, there are two things that will be very helpful.
[time=2253] One is if you are wise.
[time=2256] If you're able to use logic and reason and historical data and statistical analysis and quantum figures, and if you can put together an impressive presentation that is full of significant information that people have never heard before, if you are wise, that will impress them.
[time=2275] Secondly, if you want to impress them, if you're able to communicate that with a voice that
[time=2283] is deep and robust, a lot like mine, and if you're able to make your grammar just perfect, and if you are able to enunciate your words properly, and you can speak with excellence, that will impress audiences.
[time=2303] As a matter of fact, the rhetoritians of the Greek world used to learn to speak by putting a pebble in their mouth.
[time=2310] And they would learn to speak with a pebble in their mouth and then a larger one, and then two or three, so that they would learn to control their lips and their tongue at any time under any circumstance they could pronounce their words just properly so.
[time=2328] They were masters in speech.
[time=2332] Paul says, when I came to you, I came in simplicity.
[time=2339] I wasn't there to impress anyone with my wisdom or with my skills as an orator.
[time=2348] Let's be honest, Paul could have done both.
[time=2351] He was such a good spokesperson for Christ that on his first missionary journey, when he and Barnabas went into Asia Minor and they preached the word, the people saw the miracles, they heard him speak, and they said, it is the voice of a God.
[time=2368] I've been preaching, counting my years and camping about 10 years.
[time=2374] No one has ever said, it is the voice of a God.
[time=2380] Paul had an ability to put forth the message in a way that astonished the world.
[time=2388] And you want to talk about a man who was wise.
[time=2391] When he had an Hebrew audience, he spoke Hebrew.
[time=2395] When he had a Greek audience, he spoke Greek.
[time=2400] When he had a Roman audience, he spoke Latin.
[time=2404] He was a man who could go to Mars Hill in the areaopagus of Athens, the citadel of the intelligency of the day.
[time=2412] And he could walk among them, and he could debate their philosophy with them, quoting Epimenedes and Erastus and a whole line of Greek philosophers.
[time=2422] He knew it all.
[time=2425] When he stood before a hostile Jewish audience, he could recite their history and confound their historians.
[time=2434] And when he stood before Roman governors, he could use their own laws to manipulate his own case and control the whole courtroom.
[time=2444] There's anyone who had wisdom.
[time=2447] Paul had it.
[time=2449] And yet he says, when I came to you, I didn't use wisdom of men or eloquence of speech.
[time=2458] I don't misunderstand here.
[time=2460] Paul's not advocating that we all read D.L. Moody's manuscripts and speak the way he spoke.
[time=2467] I'm sure that ain't what Paul means.
[time=2471] Nor is he saying, forget education, forget learning, forget backgrounds.
[time=2476] But what he is saying is this.
[time=2478] The gospel of Jesus Christ is at its most powerful when it's at its most simple.
[time=2486] Paul said, I came to you and I for-- can't get the word to come out right.
[time=2493] I did for go, he said, all the wisdom, all the science, all the discipline of learning, all the excellency of speech.
[time=2502] And I kept it simple.
[time=2506] And he emphasizes that in the next verse when he says, for I determined not to know anything among you except for Jesus Christ and him, crucified.
[time=2522] Now what Paul means there is not that he took his intelligence and he set it on a shelf.
[time=2528] He wasn't advocating, taking your intelligence and forgetting it, taking your skills and forgetting them.
[time=2534] He simply said this, out of everything that I know, the thing that I know the most and the thing that I have the most preeminent, the thing that I want you to see the most is Jesus Christ.
[time=2545] And everything else that I do and how I do those things and say them is simply to get you to see one thing and that's Christ.
[time=2555] If you want to measure your effectiveness as a Sunday school teacher, the answer is when they left, did they see Christ?
[time=2567] Did they really see Christ?
[time=2571] If you want to measure your effectiveness as a home Bible study leader, when they left, did they see Christ?
[time=2580] If you want to measure your effectiveness as your ability to share the gospel, did they see Christ?
[time=2588] One wears me tells the story of a church that had a stained glass window with a Jesus in the stained glass window.
[time=2596] And one Sunday, the pastor, who was a very tall man, was gone.
[time=2601] And the guest speaker was relatively short.
[time=2604] A little girl sitting in the front row said, hey mommy, where's that man that usually stands there so we can't see Jesus?
[time=2612] Boy, let that be a lesson to all of us who ever have the privilege of teaching or sharing, that we never want to take a posture, that people don't see Jesus.
[time=2624] The best barometer of a message, a Sunday school lesson, a Bible study, or a testimony that's shared is did the people leave talking about the message or the messenger?
[time=2638] Paul said, when I got done, you were talking about Jesus Christ and not me, not me.
[time=2649] He said, I kept the gospel simple.
[time=2655] Please don't understand.
[time=2656] I'm not saying take counseling and push it aside.
[time=2664] Take human relationships and push it aside.
[time=2667] Take medicine and push it aside.
[time=2669] Not at all, it's not an either or, it's a both and.
[time=2672] That we both have the practical applications of academic discipline and we have Christ and He's preeminent in the combination.
[time=2684] We don't need less public school teachers.
[time=2687] We need more educated qualified public school teachers who have Christ and He's preeminent.
[time=2695] We don't need less doctors.
[time=2697] We need more doctors who have Christ in their heart and He's preeminent in their life.
[time=2704] We don't need less businessmen with management principles.
[time=2707] We need more of them who know management but who've got Christ in His preeminent in their lives.
[time=2715] We don't need less counselors and psychologists and psychiatrists and psychiatrists.
[time=2720] We need more of them who know the areas of mental behavior but who have Christ and they've made Him preeminent in their practice.
[time=2729] We don't need less politicians who understand the law.
[time=2733] We need more of them who have Christ in these preeminent in their life.
[time=2738] Paul was a philosopher.
[time=2742] Paul was a language expert.
[time=2745] Paul was a historical expert but when you heard him, you heard about Christ and all of these other disciplines simply pointed the way.
[time=2753] See what Paul was saying?
[time=2759] He was saying keep it simple.
[time=2761] Sharing Jesus Christ is simple.
[time=2764] It's really not a matter of excellency of speech, our profoundness of wisdom.
[time=2771] It's keeping it simple.
[time=2774] D.L. Moody was invited to England and there he was to speak at one of the premier universities of the Western world, Cambridge.
[time=2784] Cambridge at that time was still somewhat of a religious institution along with an academic institution of excellence.
[time=2793] A number of the students were appalled that this barbarian, this American, this atrocious murderer of the King's English was going to come at the pinnacle of higher education and speak.
[time=2806] A number of them determined that they were gonna boycott the meetings.
[time=2810] Others of them determined that they were going to respond to Moody's barbaric way and an appropriate way by hooting and jeering and whistling.
[time=2820] Moody lived up to their expectations with his atrocious language.
[time=2825] He stood before them and his first statement was don't think that God don't love you for he do.
[time=2831] A student sharing later said that infuriated me
[time=2837] but he said it again.
[time=2839] Don't think that God don't love you for he do.
[time=2842] He said that phrase rang throughout my mind the whole time Moody was speaking.
[time=2848] Don't think God don't love you for he do.
[time=2851] And that antagonistic student came to Christ when someone said don't think God don't love you for he do.
[time=2861] That wasn't profound.
[time=2865] That certainly was an excellence of speech but it was simply saying God loves you.
[time=2871] Yes, he does.
[time=2873] He loves you.
[time=2875] Keep it simple, keep it simple.
[time=2879] Paul said in simplicity, I shared Christ.
[time=2885] Not an excellence of speech, not in wisdom.
[time=2889] I really acted like I didn't know anything else except for Christ.
[time=2894] It's simple.
[time=2897] It's not a matter of knowing a lot.
[time=2899] It's a matter of knowing Christ.
[time=2901] That's enough.
[time=2902] That is a lot.
[time=2905] Secondly, Paul said that he preached to them in simplicity.
[time=2909] Secondly, he said he shared sincerely.
[time=2913] And verses two, or excuse me, three and four, Paul uses five little, if you will, prepositional phrases to describe the way he communicated.
[time=2925] I wanna wrap those up in the words sincerely.
[time=2928] Let me give them to you very quickly.
[time=2930] First of all, he said he came to them in weakness.
[time=2934] What he meant by weakness is he didn't come on as the strong man.
[time=2939] I don't know whether Paul had read or had not read power through intimidation.
[time=2943] But he didn't come with a dominant personality and come with his human might and control them with his strength.
[time=2954] They're people whose personalities are so dominant that they control a situation by intimidation.
[time=2963] Paul said I didn't come and intimidate you.
[time=2965] I didn't come and control you and manipulate you with power.
[time=2970] I came in weakness.
[time=2972] Why is that?
[time=2975] Well, there's an old expression worth our remembering.
[time=2979] It says this, a man persuaded against his will is of his own opinion still.
[time=2986] We may come on so strong that people are gonna do
[time=2992] what we say because we said so.
[time=2994] You know, when they get away from us, they'll go back to their own opinions.
[time=2999] Paul said I came in weakness.
[time=3001] I wasn't trying to manipulate you.
[time=3003] I wasn't trying to dominate and control you with power.
[time=3006] Secondly, he said I came in fear and thirdly, entrembling.
[time=3012] That does not mean that Paul was afraid.
[time=3014] He had been stoned at Listra, beaten in prison at Philippi, ran out of town in Athens and Thessal and Ike and Brea.
[time=3021] He wasn't afraid.
[time=3022] What that little phrase put together, fear and trembling means with deep conviction of sincerity.
[time=3031] He used that phrase a lot, not to refer to a timid spirit as much as a sincere one who said this is serious.
[time=3041] I'm deeply concerned with all the respect
[time=3047] I have for God and for you, sincerely, here's the message.
[time=3052] Fourthly, he said that he did not come with enticing words.
[time=3059] He didn't have any great come-ons.
[time=3063] You know, he didn't provide some great statement promising everything under the sun to entice people to come.
[time=3070] He wasn't using modern advertising methods where they promise you if you use this toothpaste, you'll be married by Friday.
[time=3079] If you use this deodorant, you'll get the job.
[time=3083] Isn't it amazing how we're told these great statements as though they're gonna make everything better in life?
[time=3089] Why, if your dog eats the right food, you know he'll even start to glow.
[time=3093] And I know many of you have been worrying about your dog glowing.
[time=3096] Really strong come-ons, the old bait and switch.
[time=3104] We open up the tabloid and it says there's a deal there and you say this is too good a deal to be true.
[time=3109] So you rush to the store and you were right.
[time=3111] It is too good a deal to be true.
[time=3114] They don't have it.
[time=3115] But for just a few hundred dollars more, they can give you a better model.
[time=3119] You know, enticing words that kind of hook us and pull us in and sucker us.
[time=3127] Paul said I didn't use enticing words.
[time=3129] I didn't promise you pie in the sky.
[time=3132] I didn't promise you that everything is gonna be wonderful.
[time=3135] There were no enticing words.
[time=3138] Fifthly, he said I just came sincerely demonstrating the power of God and don't misunderstand that one.
[time=3146] When he said I came demonstrating the power of God, he did not speak of the spectacular.
[time=3152] Paul didn't mean that he came in and he healed this one and he restored that one and he raised this one from the dead and he spoke in tongues.
[time=3159] That's not what he meant at all.
[time=3160] If you read Luke's account of Paul's visit to Corinth in the peninsula of Achaia, there are no miracles.
[time=3168] Do you know what the power that he demonstrated was?
[time=3171] Look back at chapter 18 of Acts and you'll see what Paul meant by a demonstration of power.
[time=3177] Acts chapter 18 and verses seven and eight.
[time=3182] Paul is at Corinth.
[time=3186] He's been preaching in the synagogues.
[time=3188] The Jews have rejected him.
[time=3189] They've accused him of blaspheming.
[time=3192] He now turns to the Gentiles as well.
[time=3196] It says and he departed from there the synagogue and entered into a certain man's house named Titus Justice, one who worshiped God whose house was next to the synagogue.
[time=3210] And notice this, in Christmas, the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians.
[time=3223] Hearing believed and were baptized.
[time=3227] That was the demonstration of power that Paul shared the simple gospel of Christ and people believed and their lives were changed.
[time=3240] Here you took a man by the name of Christmas, deeply entrenched in the Jewish tradition in philosophy and law and suddenly his life was revolutionized and it's changed and it becomes a follower of Christ.
[time=3253] That is a demonstration of power.
[time=3255] The greatest demonstration of God's power that our world will ever see is your life being transformed by Christ.
[time=3265] When you become a new creature and live it out in obedience to Christ, that is the greatest miracle since the resurrection of Christ himself.
[time=3276] And that's the demonstration that Paul said, I simply came, I preached the gospel, people responded and you saw God's power at work.
[time=3284] Simply share Christ sincerely.
[time=3294] Wisdom is not necessary.
[time=3298] Excellence of speech, not necessary.
[time=3303] Powerful and ticing words, it's not necessary.
[time=3307] Spectacular, it's not necessary.
[time=3310] It's just a heart that will simply and sincerely and then finally, specifically share Christ, verse five.
[time=3324] Paul said, I've done all this so that
[time=3331] your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
[time=3337] Quick English lesson.
[time=3341] There are two English words that.
[time=3344] There's a that that goes with a this.
[time=3347] This and that are called demonstrative pronouns.
[time=3349] There's another that that introduces a purpose clause.
[time=3354] You can always tell this, that from a this and that if the word so makes sense in front of that, then it's a purpose clause.
[time=3363] It makes sense here.
[time=3366] Stick a little word there.
[time=3367] Paul said, I've done all of this so that.
[time=3371] Why did he do it?
[time=3372] He did it so that they would not trust in him.
[time=3376] They wouldn't trust in human wisdom.
[time=3378] They wouldn't trust in human counseling.
[time=3382] They wouldn't trust in humans views of theology.
[time=3384] They would simply trust in Christ, the power of God.
[time=3389] Specifically, Paul's message was not a great lengthy rendition of the prophets.
[time=3397] Was not an exposition of what he had already written of New Testament canon.
[time=3402] It was simply telling them about the Lord Jesus Christ and that they needed to put their faith in him and him alone.
[time=3411] If you counsel, that's great, but specifically share Christ.
[time=3421] If you support someone in a time of grief, that's great, but specifically share Christ.
[time=3428] If we do not give them Christ in terms of eternity,
[time=3435] we've given them nothing.
[time=3438] We may have given them a Band-Aid to get them through this crisis, and that's good without Christ.
[time=3445] We really haven't given them anything.
[time=3448] It's amazing.
[time=3450] You really wanna know who the best witnesses for Christ are?
[time=3454] Whether or not the seminary students are grads, I can tell you that.
[time=3458] The best witnesses for Christ are always
[time=3464] those who just came to know him.
[time=3469] That's when they're the best.
[time=3471] Because they share.
[time=3473] We've been sharing with you the ministry of the Bible hour
[time=3485] through music and the spoken word by our pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3498] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3507] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me.
[time=3512] I ask you to come in Jesus today, and your name I pray, amen.
