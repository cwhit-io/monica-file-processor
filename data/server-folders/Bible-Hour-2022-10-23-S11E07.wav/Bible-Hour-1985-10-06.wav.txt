[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=79] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=85] it's the Bible Hour. With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and
[time=92] soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks. Join us, won't you, for
[time=99] the Bible Hour.
[time=101] (music playing)
[time=161] Thank you, you may be seated. Thank you, choir and orchestra, and Scott and Paul. That
[time=183] is a great call to worship this morning to sing how great thou art, with our choir and
[time=189] a 25-piece orchestra and men playing the piano in the organ. There is a sense of power that
[time=195] comes when we sing of the greatness of our God, and we are aware today that we do have a great God and that He is powerful, and we have come today to worship Him. We want to thank you for joining us today. It's our privilege to assemble in this place and to lift our voices together and praise the Lord. We also want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible Hour and thank them for the privilege of coming into their homes or perhaps their hospital room today to declare that we think our God is a great God. We know He is a great
[time=225] God, and He is not only a great God, but He is a holy God. Holy is He. Holy, holy, holy.
[time=235] And now as our choir directs our hearts to praise, with that great anthem, holy is He.
[time=265] Holy is He. And worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence of days, and round
[time=290] Him with worship and praise. Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=305] Holy is He. Who pardons my inner G to heal me from within? Who lives my God and life
[time=332] and sets me on my feet again? Who leads me on the shepherd when I'm going to sing?
[time=347] He is not the one I pray today. Holy is He. And pray is His glory.
[time=374] Holy is He. And worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence of days, and round Him with
[time=394] praise. Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=409] Holy is He. And I know He does He finds me where I lie, who loves us by my broken eye
[time=425] till I wake Him inside, whose life deserves the honor to make me boy is strong.
[time=442] I say good at my own. Holy is He. And pray is His glory.
[time=464] Holy is He. And worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence of days, and round Him with
[time=484] praise. Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=497] Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=497] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 113 seconds] Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He....
[time=635] Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=654] Again we thank the hymn writers and the arrangers for arranging music that inspires our hearts and I know that it inspired yours. We are grateful for the choir and their efforts in helping us to worship the Lord. We are going to ask you to omit the next hymn.
[time=669] Stephen Maria Gardner, our friends, members of our church, but they traveled regularly in musical concerts throughout the country. They have been to the west coast and east coast throughout the last three months and just haven't been home. We saw them Friday and I said, do you have a chance to be at our church on Sunday morning? They said, yes, we are going to Chicago at night, but we can stay for a little while. So we decided that they needed to sing for us. Blackhawk prides itself in the change of pace often. That song
[time=697] was a majestic song and then I asked Stephen Maria to do a very different song. I can still hear the music. We are going to have a package of songs now by Stephen Maria, then the quartet
[time=709] and then we will hear again from Stephen Maria. The Lord bless you.
[time=713] It's about the prodigal son, the joy of returning home to the family of God.
[time=725] Childhood memories surround me. I remember when Jesus loves me was the song and I believed
[time=735] it then. And of all the things in our old church, the things I most recall were the happy music
[time=744] and smiling folks to pick me up when I fall and I can hear the music. I can see them smiling
[time=756] and asking me back again. And you know I really did feel love you have and there is a family
[time=765] love and I want to be a family man. Friends and memories keep changing. I was changing
[time=774] too. It was time to question all the things that I once knew. Time went by and I grew up
[time=784] and faith fell by the way. I guess I grew too wise for God. His light had turned to gray.
[time=796] Soon the gray had turned to black. The darkness spilled my mind. I stumbled on until at last.
[time=804] I knew that I was blind. Then finally like the prodigal son, I chose no motor on. I came
[time=812] back into that little old church and knew that I had come home and I can hear the music. I
[time=824] can see them smiling and asking me back again. And you know I really did feel a bit of have
[time=834] and there. It's a family love and I want to be a family man. I can still hear the music.
[time=846] I can see them smiling asking me back again. And you know I really did feel a bit of have
[time=857] and there. It's a family love and I want to be a family man. I can still hear the music.
[time=869] I can see them smiling and asking me back again. And you know I really did feel a bit of have
[time=879] and there. It's a family love and I want to be a family man. It's a family love and I want
[time=887] to be a family man. It's a family love and I want to be a family man.
[time=909] Wondering aimlessly, thirsting endlessly. All I found was bitter water from energy
[time=930] stream. All my soul be cry, how I feel to die. Everlasting life was just a dream. Water from
[time=942] the rock is what I needed. Water from which no one is denied. And when I came to Christ for my salvation,
[time=953] I told Jesus was the rock that satisfied. In this wilderness, earth's dark wilderness. He was
[time=963] smitten with the raw heart from his father's hand. All my sins he bore as he suffered more than this
[time=972] human mind could understand. Water from the rock is what I needed. Water from which no one is
[time=983] denied. And when I came to Christ for my salvation, I found Jesus was the rock that satisfied, satisfied.
[time=999] If you're looking for life with something more. There's refreshing water flowing out from
[time=1013] Calvary. Leave your past behind. Climb God's hill and climb. Heavens answer for your souls
[time=1030] even. Water from the rock is what I needed. Water from which no one is denied. And when I came to Christ
[time=1046] for my salvation, I found Jesus was the rock that satisfied. I found Jesus was the rock that satisfied.
[time=1073] Oh, that's great. Now we change pace a little bit again. This really ought to be the prayer of
[time=1079] all of us who are believers. O master, let me walk with you.
[time=1109] Friends of so this spring, teach me thy secret, help me pray. The strain of joy, the bread again.
[time=1136] Leave us alone to move by some clear winning hand. Teach me the way would be to sing.
[time=1163] And God let in the way would win. In hope that sins shining rain. Far down the future as
[time=1189] rotten way. In peace that only thou canst hear. With thee, O master, let me pray.
[time=1215] O let me walk with thee.
[time=1234] Again we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour. We are certainly trusting God
[time=1242] in praying that he'll use the ministry of music and the spoken word to encourage your heart today.
[time=1248] Pete, how are you after a busy weekend? I'm fine, Rick. We had a clinic in Marion, Indiana with some of our viewers that watched the Bible hour and we just had a great musical event last evening there. Well, it's always encouraging for Pete and I to be out in the community because we have the privilege of meeting many of you at clinics like Pete has done or at the super 60s anniversary or
[time=1268] wherever we may be and we want to thank you for your letters and your personal words of encouragement.
[time=1273] Today we'd like to share a very helpful booklet for you from one of my favorite authors, Charles
[time=1279] Swindall. The booklet is entitled with one word simply woman and Pastor Swindall has taken
[time=1286] some of the excellent statements of scripture and given some keen insights to help us understand
[time=1292] the great position the elevation that God has put on the role of being a woman. We hear much in these
[time=1299] days about the role of women being depreciated and the Bible elevates the role of a woman in a
[time=1305] great way and we want to send you this booklet so that you can better understand what God's plan
[time=1311] for a womanhood is. If you'd like a copy of it we'd love to send it to you free as a gift from us
[time=1317] to you. Simply write to us today. Pete tell our friends how they can receive a copy would you please?
[time=1323] Yes we encourage you to write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is
[time=1329] 46815. Ask for the booklet women and write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1339] You know Pete we always enjoy having Stephen here to sing and I'm sure you enjoyed them
[time=1345] as they have ministered throughout our community many times but they're here with us today to tell us a little bit about a new album they have coming out. Rick it was about a year and a half ago that we premiered their album United We Stand and now Stephen Maria are with us again you've had a
[time=1361] long summer and we haven't seen you at Blackhawk very much but it's been a very good one hasn't it?
[time=1365] It has been it's been a long busy summer. Did you travel clear across the country? Oh yes in fact it
[time=1371] seemed like we traveled across the country a couple of times. We were east coast and west coast both with about two months on the west coast. Stephen Maria have a great ministry in the churches a great song to sing and a great testimony. It'll be November 9th that we will again hear
[time=1385] about their new record that will be released at that time and we're going to have a concert here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church. In between your travels I understand that you've been in the studio getting the record ready. Those are exciting days aren't they? Yeah they really are especially this time I think. I'm more excited about the music on this album than any we've ever done.
[time=1404] It's been really exciting for us. What is the theme of the record? Oh the theme of the record. I don't
[time=1410] know if we do we have a theme on this record? Well the title of the the title of the album is the best love song came from a broken heart and of course that talks about the crucifixion of Jesus
[time=1420] Christ and so we are just really thrilled with that particular song but there's just a lot of new music. Steve has helped write has either written by himself or helped write six out of the ten songs and I've written one of them and that's always fun and Mandy a little daughter Mandy who just turned ten she'll be singing a song as well. So we're excited. There's quite a variety really
[time=1439] I think a fair balance some songs a couple of them are marriage and family oriented but some
[time=1445] are praise oriented some of them just dealing with the Christian experience quite a bit of variety.
[time=1450] Well I listened to the record yesterday the tape that you gave me and it's just very exciting and you mentioned your little daughter Mandy when I listened to that I had to listen very closely.
[time=1460] She's not too little anymore she's growing up and her voice is maturing and it's exciting to have your own daughter singing with you I'm sure. Now let me remind you again that on November 9th
[time=1470] put that date on your calendar because at 7 p.m. we'll premiere that record right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and it's going to be a very exciting evening to meet Stephen Marie and hear this new music. Rick it's going to be great. I'm looking forward to it. November the 9th is a Saturday
[time=1486] and we're thankful we can have you here on a Saturday. That allows people who go to other churches to come and enjoy the concert to hear the premiere of your album and yet not have to
[time=1496] go away from their church for a Sunday evening. So do mark that on your calendar. November the 9th at 7 p.m. 7 p.m. Great. Stephen Maria thank you for being partners with us in the ministry. It is
[time=1507] a joy just to know you as friends and to share in the ministry together with you. Thank you.
[time=1513] Stephen Maria we're in my hometown of Akron, Ohio. How long ago? Three or four weeks? Maybe three weeks ago I think. And I got good reports on you from my mom and dad so well done back in Akron, Ohio.
[time=1524] Thank you again for joining us today and we're going to go back to the live part of our morning worship service and we want to encourage you if you don't have your Bible out to get it out now and open at the first Corinthians to study with us today.
[time=1564] Amen. As a helpless baby came the Lord of heaven. Oh child what love he must have had for you and for me.
[time=1583] He came down that holy night. He came down to save us all. And one day love him on a cross to take
[time=1605] my place. His name is love love love. His name is Jesus. That was a day when God revealed himself
[time=1625] to man through Jesus Christ his only son. What a perfect life he lived. What wisdom taught us.
[time=1643] But most of all what love he had for you and for me. Love came down that holy night.
[time=1658] Love came down to save us all. And one day love him on a cross.
[time=1673] To take my place. His name is love love. His name is Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[time=1691] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[time=1714] Our Father we thank you for the love that you have for us in Christ Jesus. As a songwriter has put
[time=1724] it the words we stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene and wonder how he could love me
[time=1735] a sinner condemned unclean how marvelous oh how wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[time=1747] Father there's a sense today that we are simply resting in that love. Today we do sense that you
[time=1756] care that you love us. We know what it means to be washed and to be forgiven and we've come to worship
[time=1764] you and to give you thanks and praise. Father we thank you for your word that it opens our mind
[time=1771] and our spirit to new dimensions that we would miss and so we pray this morning as we study your
[time=1778] word that you would make it to come alive within us. Father today we would ask that you would minister
[time=1786] to the diversity of this body of people. We pray particularly for those who have suffered loss in
[time=1792] recent days particularly for Joy Schindler. We pray that you would comfort our heart. We pray for
[time=1799] those who are battling cancer. We thank you for an encouraging report on Mary's from the doctor.
[time=1805] We pray for Dick Jackson, Catherine Northrup and others who battle cancer. We thank you for the
[time=1812] progress that's been made in lives like Joyce Freeze. We rejoice in that. Father today we pray
[time=1819] for Phil Penal that you would give to his body recovery from a car accident. Father we pray that
[time=1826] he would not only minister physically but most of all spiritually. Help each one of us today to
[time=1832] see past the cares of life today, the frustrations that build up and to get a heavenly perspective on
[time=1840] life. Help us to be better parents, better husbands and wives. Help the love of Christ to flow through us
[time=1849] like a clean open vessel. May there be those today who sense his love and trust in him a savior.
[time=1856] God we don't know why your son would die other than your great love so we thank you for that. In
[time=1864] Jesus' name, Amen. Why would Jesus die because he would love us? Please pay attention to the words
[time=1874] as Christal sings to prepare our hearts to study the Scripture.
[time=1885] Why did they mail him to Calvary's tree? Why tell me why was he there?
[time=1901] Jesus, the helper, the healer, the friend. Why tell me why was he there?
[time=1918] Oh, my iniquities are nailing. He nailed them all to the dream. Jesus, the dead of my sin,
[time=1937] who we paid. He paid the rest for me.
[time=1951] Why should he love me a sinner I know?
[time=1965] Why tell me why should he care?
[time=1973] My iniquities are nailing. He nailed them all to the dream.
[time=2003] Jesus, the dead of my sin, who we paid. He paid the rest for me.
[time=2025] Yes, he paid the rest for me.
[time=2040] Thank you, Crystal. He paid the dead of ransom for me. Jesus Christ, the Bible makes it abundantly
[time=2051] clear, died for one purpose, my sin, and of course yours. Let's study the message of the
[time=2061] Scriptures today together. Open your Bibles with us to first Corinthians the second chapter, and we're going to look at verses 1, or excuse me, verses 6 through 16. And in this passage,
[time=2075] the Apostle Paul explains to us that God has a wisdom, a wisdom as we saw a few weeks ago,
[time=2081] that's above any wisdom we have, and God wants us to have that wisdom.
[time=2087] I hope today that your mind and your spirit are open to receiving all that God has
[time=2095] for you. I know that I am. I hope there's an eager anticipation of growing in Christ,
[time=2103] verse 6 of chapter 2. However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
[time=2113] age, nor of the princes of this age, that come to nothing. But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[time=2121] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory,
[time=2130] which none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified
[time=2138] the Lord of glory. But as it is written, I have not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
[time=2149] the heart of a man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath
[time=2157] revealed them unto us by his spirit, for the spirit searches all things,
[time=2163] yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, except the spirit of a man,
[time=2172] which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God. Now we have received
[time=2182] not the spirit of the world, but the spirit who is of God, that we might know the things that are
[time=2190] freely given to us of God, which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches,
[time=2199] but what the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural
[time=2207] man receiveeth not the spirit of God, for there are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them
[time=2214] because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judges all things,
[time=2224] yet he himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
[time=2233] him, but we have the mind of Christ. The Bible in this passage and in many many other places divides
[time=2244] all of humanity into two separate groups. Various terms are used in the scriptures to describe the
[time=2252] two groups. Occasionally they are described in these words, those who are saved and those who are
[time=2261] lost, aligned between the true, because you are either saved or lost. There is no middle ground.
[time=2270] But in this passage it describes humanity with two different terms. It describes those who are
[time=2277] spiritual and those who are natural. Now please don't misunderstood or perhaps be offended.
[time=2289] The words spiritual and natural are not representing as one being superior to the other. They're not
[time=2296] conditions of quality. This one is spiritual. Oh, I'm better than you are because I'm spiritual
[time=2303] and you're natural. No, it's not the point of the scripture at all to say that one is better
[time=2310] than the other. This person here may be born again. That makes them spiritual because they have the
[time=2316] spirit of God in them. This person has not been born again. They have not received the spirit of
[time=2325] God. Therefore they are a natural person without the spirit. Now you may be a spiritual man or woman
[time=2335] and be an engineer and not be nearly as good an engineer as this man who's natural and who's an engineer. Your spiritual condition does not improve your perception of mathematics.
[time=2346] You may be a data programmer and born again sitting next to someone who's working on the keys
[time=2356] who's never received Christ and they can enter the data far faster than you can.
[time=2361] You see it's not a condition of superiority. It's simply a condition that the spirit of God is in
[time=2369] you and you've been made clean. Let me illustrate this with something that I see far too often.
[time=2376] A fork. There are all kinds of forks to eat with. Occasionally we have a church dinner here and
[time=2385] we break out the good stuff. You know the double thick plastic forks. The kind when you go to
[time=2391] cut through your pie the fork breaks before the pie does. Some of you may have some of that beautiful
[time=2398] pewter colonial three pronged silverware. Your fork may be made of precious metal like pewter
[time=2406] and mine out of plastic. Well yours is superior to mine that it is. Now just suppose for illustrative
[time=2416] purposes though they both been used. Let's make it really crude by my two year old son eating spaghetti.
[time=2423] Neither one of those forks are real attractive but the pewter one still may be of more value.
[time=2430] But let's just suppose that we take the plastic one and we immerse it in soapy water
[time=2439] and we get all the leftovers off and it's clean. Did you see the difference? That's what a spiritual
[time=2449] person is. It's not someone who is necessarily better. It's just they've been immersed. If you're
[time=2456] pardon the directness of the analogy they've been immersed in the blood of Christ. The only thing
[time=2462] that washes in the way. They're not better. They're not smarter. They're not loved more by God.
[time=2470] They're just clean and the spirits within them and so the word calls them spiritual
[time=2477] and it calls those who have not been washed and made clean natural. Now Paul's writing to a group
[time=2486] of people and he's trying to help them to see the wisdom of God but he explains to them that
[time=2492] your condition whether your spiritual or natural is going to largely determine how well you'll
[time=2498] understand the wisdom of God. He said when we came in verses one through five and we presented
[time=2504] Christ we kept it simple but what we had may have been simple but it's wisdom to those who've been
[time=2511] made perfect. You're saying oh really? Christians are now perfect? You mean your plastic is now perfect?
[time=2516] No not at all. The word perfect means growing towards maturity. We planted a garden for the first
[time=2524] time this year. A green thumb award we won't receive. Farming requires something that I have a small bit
[time=2535] of patience. And the carrots came in and the green stock shot up and I pushed the dirt aside and I
[time=2542] could see the top of an orange carrot. Kathy said you're supposed to wait. We talked a lawn next
[time=2548] door he said wait I couldn't wait and I pulled out some of the nicest oranges inch and a half long
[time=2555] carrots you've ever seen. They weren't mature. They hadn't grown yet. Now when Paul says in verse
[time=2565] six I'm writing to those of you who are perfect. He's not saying those of you who don't sin anymore.
[time=2570] Wouldn't that be great? But it's not reality. We all sin. We're not perfect but we're growing in
[time=2580] maturity like a carrot. He says I'm writing to you wisdom. It's God's wisdom and now he's going to
[time=2589] give us if you'll allow me to break it down this way. Seven descriptions of God's wisdom.
[time=2594] First of all he says this God's wisdom in verse six is totally different than all other human
[time=2602] wisdom. It's absolutely totally different. He says it's not the wisdom of this world.
[time=2608] Nor is it the wisdom of the princes of this world. By prince he doesn't mean someone who sets on the
[time=2614] throne and reigns over a monarch. He means someone who is a leader. It's not the wisdom that the
[time=2621] intelligent leadership scholars of the world would call wisdom. It's a totally different wisdom.
[time=2632] God's wisdom is completely different than all human wisdom. Secondly he says that God's wisdom
[time=2639] is hidden like a mystery to the human mind. God's wisdom is different and it's not only different
[time=2649] but it's hidden. It's veiled. It's a mystery waiting to be unlocked, released, explained,
[time=2659] let go. It's like a present under the Christmas tree. You can shake it. You can squeeze it but
[time=2666] you're not quite sure what it is until you open it up. It's a mystery.
[time=2670] And to prove that it's a mystery in case you think that humans have all the knowledge there is
[time=2680] he says let me give you an illustration that proves that the wisdom of God is hidden.
[time=2687] Verse 8 he said God sent his son into the world the Lord Jesus Christ and Christ lived a sinless
[time=2695] life but did people recognize it? Then they say this has got to be God. Look at the perfection.
[time=2701] They didn't. Why? Because it was hidden. They didn't listen to him teach and say this wisdom's
[time=2708] got to come from God. This man must be God. They didn't. They didn't observe his miracles and say
[time=2716] this has got to be God. Instead they crucified the Lord of glory which proves that God's wisdom
[time=2725] is hidden. It is veiled. Thirdly in verse 9 it says that God's wisdom is not understood
[time=2735] through natural methods. Why is it that God's wisdom is veiled? Why is it hidden? Because it's
[time=2741] not understood through natural methods. Now some of you like me endured philosophy courses in
[time=2750] college and graduate school. Let me drag out a big word from a dark past epistemology. Some of
[time=2759] you are going like this. You've never heard it before. You're lucky. Others of you are saying I remember it. Refresh me. Epistemology is simply the study of study. Epistemology is saying how do
[time=2772] we know what we know? We know things through four different ways. Let me give those to you.
[time=2777] First of all we know things through sensory perception. We see something. Are we hear something? Are we
[time=2784] smell something? Are we touch something? That's sensory perception. Science calls it empiricism.
[time=2792] Well I look across the auditorium and I see that you're here. I now know that you're here because I see you. Even if I didn't see I knew you were here today because I heard you when you sang
[time=2803] how great thou art. How did I know that empirically? That's how we know things. There's a second way
[time=2809] we know things that's called rationalism or reason. I may know something but I've never seen it or
[time=2818] I've never sensed it. Let me give you an illustration of that. This is a true statement. All fathers
[time=2826] are men. This is another true statement. Sam is a father. I can conclude from that having never
[time=2836] seen Sam that Sam is of the male gender of the human species. I reasoned that out. I knew you'd
[time=2843] think I was smart. Just the way I could put all that logic together. That's called reason or rationalism.
[time=2849] That's a second way we know something. Empirically through our sentences are reasoning through our mind.
[time=2854] Our third way which is a little bit suspect but my wife assures me it's true called intuition.
[time=2860] That's a more subjective form of reasoning if you will. That never seems to match my
[time=2867] objective form of reasoning quite the same. Those are the ways we know something but there's a
[time=2873] fourth way we know something and that is through revelation. Revelation means you didn't see it.
[time=2879] You didn't hear it. You didn't know that it happened. You didn't have any data to reason it
[time=2885] through. Somebody just told you. For example, I could announce to you something you didn't know perhaps that yesterday in the United States of America there was a national disaster.
[time=2895] Or how state was defeated in football. Now if you didn't know that, I'm revealing that to you.
[time=2900] That's revelation. Now the whistlers are smiling because they're from Illinois.
[time=2904] No way men's at this time. Let's get this church back in order here. That's revelation.
[time=2912] Somebody told you something that you didn't know. Now the reason why God's wisdom is hidden
[time=2918] is because the Bible says mankind looks for God how empirically and rationally.
[time=2927] But look at verse 9. It says this. As it is written in the Old Testament, I have not seen nor ear heard that's empiricism nor has entered into the heart of man. That's
[time=2939] reason or intuition if you like that. The things that God has prepared will never find God will
[time=2947] never have God's wisdom if we approach God through natural methods of empiricism or rationalism.
[time=2953] That's why it's hidden. Well then how can we have it? We'll fourthly notice this.
[time=2961] The Bible says that the wisdom of God is revealed by the Spirit of God.
[time=2971] Verse 10. But God hath revealed that. He's told it to us. He's given his word. This is the revelation
[time=2978] of God's wisdom, God's will for your life and for the world. You'll never know it empirically
[time=2985] and you'll never know it intuitively and you'll never know it rationalizing. You'll only know it as it's revealed by God's Spirit when he gave us the word. And he gives us an illustration of that
[time=2998] in verse 11. He says, "No one knows what's in the mind of another man except that man himself."
[time=3008] Look at the person next to you this morning. Go ahead. You can look at them. What are they thinking? You say, "I don't know. He's sleeping. Maybe he's not thinking at all." But you don't know what that person's thinking, do you? Why, you don't know whether they're
[time=3024] thinking about the passage of Scripture that we're studying or whether they're thinking about. I hope this gets out in time to catch the kickoff of these coast NFL games. You don't know whether
[time=3034] she's thinking about the wisdom of God or whether she turned the oven on and the roast will be done when we all get home. You don't know what that person's thinking next to you. Why, you don't even know what I'm thinking even though I'm talking. I take attendance every Sunday morning during the message. No one knows what's in a person's mind except for that person himself. And he says,
[time=3058] "And no one knows what's in the mind of God but God himself." You can't reason what's in the mind
[time=3065] of God. You can't observe it. Only one who knows what's in the mind of God is God himself. And that's
[time=3071] why God's wisdom has to be received through revelation. Fifthly, he says this, "God's wisdom
[time=3079] is received by the person who has the indwelling of God's Spirit." See, the day you ask Jesus Christ
[time=3089] you come into your heart. When he knocked and you heard and you opened the door and you said, "Come in Jesus Christ and the Spirit of God came in you. And now you have the mind of Christ.
[time=3102] Now you have the mind of the Spirit. Now you can receive what's being revealed because the Spirit
[time=3109] is in you to help you to receive it." Let me give you an example of this. Right now out in space,
[time=3117] there are satellites all over the sky. And those satellites are sending out, they are revealing
[time=3125] television signals. Just as God has sent out his word, it's being sent out, it's being revealed.
[time=3134] But if you don't have a receiver, those signals don't mean anything to you. Unless you have a
[time=3140] television set that is equipped with a line that takes it to an earth receiving dish,
[time=3147] you'll never pick up those television signals. God says, "I'm sending out my word. The Spirit is
[time=3156] revealing it, but you'll never receive it because you don't have the mind of God until the Spirit
[time=3163] comes in you and that's your earth receiving dish. Until the Spirit of God comes into a person's heart,
[time=3171] the Word of God will never be received in the depth of their soul. Only the Spirit can do that.
[time=3176] That's why Jesus said, "No man comes to me unless he is drawn by the power of God the Father in the
[time=3182] Spirit." That's our earth receiving dish. And then, sixthly, it says this in the next verse,
[time=3190] it says verse 13, "That the Spirit teaches us things that we speak not in words of man's wisdom,
[time=3199] but the wisdom that the Spirit teaches." Let me take my analogy one step further.
[time=3208] If you happen to have an earth receiving dish and you are collecting the signal off of the satellite,
[time=3216] you may still have trouble because some of those stations have purposely scrambled their message
[time=3222] so that you can't receive it without an unscrambler, which they will be glad to sell you.
[time=3228] You know, as we receive God's Word by the Spirit that's in us, we would never understand it. It
[time=3237] would be a scrambled message if the Spirit wasn't in us to take it further than just receiving it
[time=3243] and teaching it to us. It happens all the time and it's exciting to see. When someone comes to
[time=3252] Christ as Savior and almost immediately, there's a new desire to study God's Word.
[time=3257] And when you get around those new believers who are fresh in God's Word, you should hear them talk.
[time=3264] Why, this is great stuff. You know, he's just reading over here the other day and I never saw that before. It may be a passage they'd heard again and again, but it just never got into their
[time=3275] Spirit because it didn't make sense because the Spirit wasn't there receiving it and teaching it
[time=3282] to them. Seventhly, the Bible says that the wisdom of God will be rejected by the natural man,
[time=3293] verse 14, but the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God. Why? They're foolishness to him. He says, "Hey, I hear that message, but that's foolishness. That's silly. That doesn't make sense. I want to see it. I want to handle it empirically. I want it to flow through my
[time=3310] logical grid." And it gets stuck because it's a wisdom that's above what his grid can handle.
[time=3319] So the natural man will not receive it, but the spiritual man will receive it.
[time=3325] And as they receive it, verse 15 says, "That allows us to judge, to appraise things.
[time=3332] That spirit that we've received and the word that we receive, it helps us to appraise what this
[time=3338] means versus what that means. It allows us to start making sense and judgments out of things that never made sense before." Now let me give you Paul's two concluding statements in verse 16.
[time=3350] First concluding statement he makes is this, "No human mind will ever approach God's intellect.
[time=3357] No human mind will ever approach God's intellect. No matter how smart you are,
[time=3364] no matter how much you've studied, no matter how many things you've tested empirically, no how many things you've deduced or deduced rationally, that wisdom as great as it is
[time=3374] will never reach and begin to approach all the wisdom that God has." He says this,
[time=3380] "For who had known the mind of the Lord?" Wow, it's beyond our finding out unless he reveals it.
[time=3387] And this, "Who's instructed God?" God went over this very thoroughly with Job. Job was starting
[time=3394] to question God and God said, "Joba, where were you when I laid the foundations of the world?
[time=3400] Or how wide was it? Tell me if you know Job or Joba, what line have you used to measure the
[time=3408] universe? Job, have you measured it? Job, what do you know compared to all that I know and all
[time=3416] that I am? No human mind will ever approach the intellect of God." Second concluding statement is this,
[time=3427] "We can receive the intellect of God. Although we may never approach it through all of our human
[time=3437] learning, and I'm here to applaud and appreciate human learning, but it will never approach God,
[time=3443] but God will give us His intellect." It says, "But we have the mind of Christ." You see,
[time=3450] when you receive Christ as your Savior, the Spirit comes within you and you get a new mind.
[time=3455] I'm not saying that it changes your mind in intellectual capabilities. I'm saying it changes
[time=3462] your mind in your ability to receive and perceive spiritual truth. I know today that the mind of
[time=3473] Christ can be yours if you will receive it. We've had a wonderful day of music here with our special
[time=3484] guest, Stephen Maria Gardner, and our musicians from our own church, and then the preaching of the word of God from our pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you.
[time=3500] Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ,
[time=3506] to die on the cross for my sins. And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart,
[time=3512] and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sins. I ask you to do that, Jesus, today. In your name,
[time=3518] I pray, amen. We are always happy when you write us and tell us the nature of your decision,
[time=3525] and when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. Earlier today, we talked about a pamphlet entitled "Woman."
