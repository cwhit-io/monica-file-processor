[time=60] with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=62] Join us, won't you, for the Bible out.
[time=65] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=117] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=130] What a delight it is today to come and to assemble
[time=136] and to sing how great thou art.
[time=139] We wanna welcome you this morning to our second worship service, as we've assembled in this place to sing of the fact that Jesus Christ is our God, our Lord, and our Savior.
[time=152] More than anything else today, we want you to know him and to know him in a personal and intimate way so that as we talk about him as Lord and Savior, you can prefix that with the little word my, my Lord and my Savior.
[time=167] Welcome today, and also we wanna share a word of welcome to our friends who join us for the Bible hour.
[time=173] Thank you for the privilege, both in your homes, hospital rooms, and in this place of declaring the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=180] There's a great familiar old hymn called Jesus Saves.
[time=185] Listen, as our choir sings that and it's updated with the synthesizer to bring together the best of the old and the new, to point our hearts to the fact that Jesus Christ is indeed our Savior.

[time=406] [APPLAUSE]
[time=411] Thomas asked the question, "How can we know the way?" And Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=417] No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." We have a wonderful Savior.
[time=422] We're going to sing that.
[time=423] Him, Him number 394.
[time=425] What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord, singing the first, second, and third stanzas together.
[time=433] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=881] Your life and mine are empty vessels waiting to be filled.
[time=888] God is pouring out a joy unmeasured on those who obey His will.
[time=895] He is forgiven with receivers of what you see in me.
[time=903] He's only a gift from the spirit of life who fills my heart constantly.
[time=911] [MUSIC]
[time=928] Every perfect gift comes from a hobo from the father of lights from the Lord of love this joy that I have that I'm singing of this from the Lord from the Lord that's where the joy comes from.
[time=946] [MUSIC]
[time=988] Every perfect gift comes from a hobo from the father of lights from the Lord of love this joy that I have that I'm singing of this from the Lord.
[time=1018] That's where the joy comes from.
[time=1024] Every perfect gift comes from a hobo from the father of lights from the Lord of love this joy that I have that I'm singing of this from the Lord from the Lord.
[time=1039] That's where the joy comes from.
[time=1061] I hope that you enjoyed the ministry of music as much as I did and not only enjoyed it but found that music was a way that God was speaking to your heart, encouraging you, challenging you, and comforting you.
[time=1075] Pete, I really appreciate all the work that you and the rest of the music department put into our Sunday services.
[time=1081] Thank you, Rick.
[time=1082] We always appreciate it when our regular people are noticed.
[time=1086] They do it because they love the Lord, but we are thankful for their talents.
[time=1090] Speaking of music, we want to remind everyone that we have a concert coming up November 9 on Saturday evening.
[time=1095] Stephen Maria Gardner will be with us and they have a new record that will be out at that time and it's going to be a very exciting evening.
[time=1101] Well, I'm looking forward to that and I know that all of our viewers are too because Steve Maria are not only from this church and from this area, but they've captured the hearts of people here in Northeastern Indiana and Western Ohio.
[time=1111] And many of you have had Steve Maria at your church at your church.
[time=1114] Steve and Steve Maria at your church at your church at your church at your church.
[time=1118] And we want to encourage you to join us.
[time=1120] We're having it on Saturday night this time.
[time=1122] And that's so that you can come and not feel like you're abandoning your own church on a Sunday night.
[time=1126] So save November the 9 to be here with Steve Maria as we celebrate and premiere a new album.
[time=1130] Their album is really exciting.
[time=1132] I've listened to the record already and it's great music for the home for the entire family.
[time=1136] We should mention too, Rick.
[time=1137] Of course, we always have music around here and we're grateful for all of our people.
[time=1141] It's great to be here with Steve Maria as we celebrate and premiere a new album.
[time=1144] Their album is really exciting.
[time=1146] I've listened to the songs that I've been doing for a while.
[time=1149] I've been doing it for a while.
[time=1667] I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while.

I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been

while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a I've been doing it
[time=2566] for
[time=2596] a
[time=2626] while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for a while I've been doing it for
[time=2682] a
[time=2712] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[time=2770] a
[time=2777] a a a a a a a a a at age 18 to go to college. For others it may be the day you push them out the door at 25. It's at different points.
[time=2808] For some they may be so mature that at 15 they're very adult-like.
[time=2813] But the difference between a young man and a child is the child is dependent and the young man is capable of caring for themselves spiritually.
[time=2823] Then the third group were fathers. But what's the difference between a father and a young man?
[time=2830] Well father has the ability not only to take care of himself, but he has the ability to be a spiritual parent to those who are still child-like.
[time=2842] Well let me ask you to do something. Where are you in your spiritual adventure? Where are you in the growth process?
[time=2855] I didn't ask how many years you've been a believer, nor did I ask how many years you've been members of a church, but where are you in your spiritual growth?
[time=2866] First of all have you been born again? Have you received Christ as your Savior? If not, that's the most important decision you'll ever make in life and you need to make that. Make it today.
[time=2879] Have you accepted Christ? Great. Are you a babe in Christ? That's fine if you just accepted Christ, but how many of you are really babes in Christ that you're dependent upon the rest of us?
[time=2893] And you've been a believer a year or two, five, ten, longer than you can remember. It should not be.
[time=2902] If you're a babe in Christ, don't deny it, admit it to yourself and get growing. Are you a young man, spiritually sound, standing on your own two feet?
[time=2911] A young woman, growing in Christ autonomously, not that you don't need the rest of the body, but you're going to make it if the rest of us don't.
[time=2919] Good for you. Keep growing and become a spiritual parent so that you can nurture those who don't know Christ and those who just came to know Him.
[time=2929] Where are you at? Don't kid yourself. Don't do what most of us do when we get our driver's license renewed and they ask, is all the information the same?
[time=2939] And you say, yes, when there's one category called W.T. that has changed significantly.
[time=2949] There's a tendency to want to make our stats look a little better than they are. Don't do that to yourself.
[time=2955] Don't kid yourself and say you're somewhere spiritually that you're not. Denial will not produce growth.
[time=2965] Paul says here that these believers in Christ were spiritually immature because they were still functioning as babes and not as adults.
[time=2979] A third characteristic of the spiritually immature is that they are divisive and not harmonious.
[time=2988] People who are immature are divisive people who constantly insist on having their own way.
[time=2998] Do you remember how much you enjoyed your kids when they were little and you took a long trip driving with three kids to Florida in a small car?
[time=3009] Those are some of the great memories in life, aren't they? She touched me.
[time=3016] His foot's on my side of the car.
[time=3020] Do you remember how civil wars, maybe global conflicts, could be started over a broken crayon?
[time=3028] What is the "that's childlike"?
[time=3033] There are some of us who are spiritually immature and are functioning the same way.
[time=3040] There's no harmony. Look at verse 3. He says, "Aren't you immature?" Look at yourself.
[time=3045] There's envy all around, strife is sitting between you and the person next to you.
[time=3051] Division is the order of the day. That's absolute immaturity.
[time=3058] For them it was one person who said, "I am of Paul." And the other one said, "I am of Paulus."
[time=3067] That's history. Let's bring it down to reality.
[time=3070] There are those today who say, "Well, I am of Bill Gothard."
[time=3077] And I've been to the advanced seminar and I've got the notebook.
[time=3083] And the other say, "Yeah, well, why you were there? I was at the Billy Graham Outreach meeting, and we're going to win the world for Christ."
[time=3091] And the two begin to say, "Which is the most important?" Depth or outreach?
[time=3101] They're both important.
[time=3103] Any of you have two children? Which one do you love the most?
[time=3107] You say, "That's absurd." You're right.
[time=3110] And to say, "Which is more important? Growth or outreach?" They're both essential.
[time=3114] God loves them both.
[time=3116] But they're those who want to divide their camp from this camp.
[time=3119] There are those that say, "The Christian School is the only way." There are others that say, "No, I heard Dr. Dobson." And he said, "The first 32 years are the developmental years, and we're going to homeschool him for 32 years."
[time=3134] And if you don't do it our way, and you're missing the boat, buddy, you're missing it.
[time=3144] And an inability, inability to accept those who are approaching the adventure in a godly way yet different.
[time=3154] They're envious.
[time=3156] More money was taken out of the church budget and given to that program for the second year in a row.
[time=3163] Can you believe how dumb those guys are?
[time=3166] They haven't increased this area at all. That's envy.
[time=3170] Strive. Strive is that idea that I am going to lobby, contend for my ideas.
[time=3181] I'm not quite sure the telephone is a total blessing.
[time=3188] Usually when someone says, "A lot of people have told me that they feel this way." Usually means I've called three or four people who listen while I told them this way.
[time=3199] That's strife. That's saying, "I want it my way, and I'm going to muster the troops.
[time=3204] I'm going to send out the notice. We're going to lobby. We're going to get our way."
[time=3210] That is a clear, precise sign of spiritual immaturity.
[time=3216] Listen to how Paul reasons with them.
[time=3219] In verse four, he identifies the problem.
[time=3223] He says, "One says I'm of Paul and another of a policy." He says, "That is carnal."
[time=3229] He says, "You're just walking his men in verse three." What's that phrase mean?
[time=3233] That means you're back to walking like men and not like spiritual minded people.
[time=3238] You're back to the flesh and you're back to the natural thinking and not the spiritual.
[time=3244] Verse five, he makes this clarification. He says, "Who is Paul?" Who is a Paulist? They're just ministers. Don't elevate minister to be better than the next person.
[time=3256] Actually, the word probably should be servant. It's not the word normally for minister.
[time=3260] It's the word normally for deacon. Don't elevate deacon either.
[time=3265] The word deacon simply means table waiter. In today's vocabulary, it means busboy.
[time=3272] That's what it means. It meant someone who was going to the table to take food and to bring it back and to clean it up, a table waiter.
[time=3281] He says, "We aren't the significant people. We are simply the servants here."
[time=3287] Don't elevate us. Don't elevate people today.
[time=3292] It's good to pay honor to whom honors do and respect to whom respect is do, but don't ever put anybody up on a spiritual plateau.
[time=3301] He said, "We're just servants." Secondly, he reasons this way with him in verse six. He says, "I've planted a Paulist water, but God's the one that made this whole thing grow and come alive.
[time=3313] I know that you need a seed and I know that you need water, but you take God out of the formula and what you're going to have is seed and water."
[time=3323] It's God that brought the increase. He said, "Yeah, I started the church and a Paulist came along and fed you,
[time=3329] but it's God. His Spirit and His Word that made all this thing happen." And so he concludes in verse seven that, "We're nothing." He says, "He that waters is nothing. He that plants is nothing, but God is everything."
[time=3345] Why are you saying we're a Paul and we're of a Paulist?
[time=3349] Those guys are nothing. It is God that gave the increase, that made it come alive, that made it grow. Then in verse eight, he reasons this way.
[time=3361] Why are you saying you're a Paul and you're of a Paulist?
[time=3364] I know a Paulist and we're getting along just fine. We're saying the same thing.
[time=3368] Why are you acting like there's some big difference?
[time=3371] We're committed to the same Lord and the same faith and the same teaching.
[time=3376] And then most significantly, I think in verses nine and ten, he says, "Yeah, we've labored.
[time=3381] We've planted. We've watered." That's right.
[time=3385] God's given the increase. That's most important.
[time=3388] And so your God's cultivated field or a different analogy, your God's building, all this grace has been given to you by God. I've laid the foundation, but notice this phrase, "But let every man take heed, how he buildeth upon it." You know what he's saying there?
[time=3405] Stop worrying about who laid which brick of the foundation.
[time=3409] You've got a foundation and you better take heed to make sure you're growing on it.
[time=3414] God expects you to grow beyond spiritual immaturity.
[time=3423] Make that commitment now. Receive Christ and grow in hell.
[time=3434] I hope that you enjoyed the special music today and the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3452] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now. Will you pray with me?
[time=3462] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3469] And today I sense indeed for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse my heart.
[time=3475] I ask you to come in dear Lord today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3481] We are always encouraged when you write to us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3485] When you write to us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
