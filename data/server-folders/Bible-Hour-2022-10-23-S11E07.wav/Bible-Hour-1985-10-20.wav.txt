[time=77] and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawke.
[time=82] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=85] [MUSIC - 77 seconds]
[time=171] - Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=174] It is a joy to welcome you this morning to a service
[time=180] where our express purpose is declaring the fact that God is our God and that He is a great God and He is worthy of our praise.
[time=187] I trust that in your heart today you've come with the express purpose of worshiping and appraising and of magnifying the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=198] Welcome this morning and also a welcome comes from our heart to those friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=205] As we share by song and by teaching of God's word, we want each of you to know today that Jesus Christ is Savior and Lord and that He has a glorious plan and that He is working all things for His glory.
[time=218] And we today listen to our choirs, they sing like a river glorious.

[time=293] [MUSIC - 117 seconds]
[time=420] - Let us continue in that theme of simply trusting Jesus every day, no matter of the circumstances,
[time=431] Him number 613, we'll sing the first, second, and third stanzas, 613.
[time=446] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=588] - A very important aspect of our morning worship time
[time=596] is your singing.
[time=597] Thank you for the fellowship and the worship that we had together, for taking one and with another in our singing.
[time=604] I want to remind you of a couple special events that'll be coming up concerning music.
[time=608] On November 3rd, we'll have tenor soloist Paul Schumacher with us, and you'll want to be here to enjoy his ministry.
[time=615] On November 9th, that's a Saturday evening at 7 p.m.
[time=619] We'll have as our special guest, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=622] They've just completed a new album entitled "The Best Love Song." You'll want to be here to hear the new songs that they've just produced, and it'll be a great evening of music on Saturday evening November 9th at 7 p.m.
[time=636] Let's listen now to the ladies' ensemble as they sing a song entitled "No Other Name." [MUSIC - 99 seconds]
[time=752] Right now, in the Convocation Center, we're making a few announcements and taking our morning offering.
[time=760] And so Pete and I have come here early with all the Bible hour technicians and cameramen and crew to record just a few moments where we can share some announcements about television with you.
[time=770] Pete, we've got Steve Maria and Paul Shoemaker both coming.
[time=774] Yes, it seems that our people love music and we get notes from time to time talking about the message and occasionally they even mention that they enjoy the music.
[time=783] So we've got some great music coming.
[time=785] Steve and Maria are going to be with us on November 9th.
[time=789] That's a Saturday evening at 7 p.m., November 9th.
[time=792] That'll be a special program because they've just finished a new record entitled "The Best Love Song" and we're going to premiere it here at the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=802] So that'll be a great night, Rick.
[time=804] And then on November 3rd on Sunday morning, Paul Shoemaker will be here.
[time=808] I think that WBCL would say "M-O-R." He's about middle of the road.
[time=812] He has a really great message and the people on television, our shut-ins will enjoy him as well as the people that come to visit us on that particular Sunday.
[time=822] Well, we're certainly looking forward to both of those events.
[time=824] Steve and Maria are a course from the Fort Wayne area members of our church here and we just have such a love and appreciation for them.
[time=831] And it's our privilege to have a concert where they premiere their newest album and we want you to have the privilege of hearing that first.
[time=838] So we're inviting you to join us here November 9th at the Convocation Center.
[time=843] What time will that be?
[time=844] That concert will be at 7 p.m.
[time=846] It's November 9th and our address is 7321 East State Boulevard.
[time=851] Thank you, Pete.
[time=852] This morning I want to share an excellent little booklet with you from my favorite author, Charles Swindall.
[time=859] The booklet is entitled "With One Simple Word Woman." And in this pamphlet, Pastor Swindall writes about the high, elevated place of a woman in the design of God.
[time=871] You may have noticed this before, but in Genesis, after God created things, he said, "It is good." Repeatedly, he said, "It is good, it is good, it is good, it is very good." There was almost a poetic rhythm there of him saying, "It is good." But the first time in history, God said, "It is not good as when he saw that Adam was alone." He said, "It is not good that man is alone." And he created a woman.
[time=898] The Bible says that the Garden of Eden wasn't complete until God created a woman.
[time=903] In our society, we've heard too many things that have been derogatory about the role of women.
[time=909] And we want to share this booklet with you to show you the high, elevated place that God has for a woman.
[time=915] It's not only an excellent book for our female viewers, but for the men as well.
[time=920] Men, I want to encourage you to write for it and to read it.
[time=923] And to grow in your relationship with your wife, your daughters, your sisters,
[time=929] perhaps your mother, right to us today and we'll send you a copy.
[time=933] Our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=939] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=944] So if you'll write to us today, we'll be glad to send you a copy.
[time=947] Again, the address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=953] 46815.
[time=955] Well, Pete, as we go back to the live part of our service today, we're going to hear Sue Torreaxing.
[time=961] Susan Torreax is going to sing a great song.
[time=963] It's entitled "I Can See." And that's the message that we proclaim here every Sunday at Blackhawk that we can be blind at one point.
[time=970] But as Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit comes into our lives, we can see spiritually.
[time=975] It's a great message, Rick.
[time=976] Well, good.
[time=977] I'm looking forward to hearing that.
[time=979] And then sharing from the scriptures with you a message on a very pointed subject called "The Judgment Seat of Christ." Too often we fail to recognize the fact that as believers, we're going to stand before the Lord Jesus Christ, and He is going to make a judgment, an evaluation of what we have done with all that He has given to us.
[time=1002] Study with us this morning.
[time=1003] If you don't have your Bible, make sure you get it and open it to first Corinthians.
[time=1007] And now as we go back, listen to the ministry of Susan Torreax, please.
[time=1012] We were just two men walking on a country road,
[time=1023] seven miles from the city to Emmaus.
[time=1026] Two men walking home from Jerusalem.
[time=1029] We were in no hurry.
[time=1031] There was no happy place for us to arrive.
[time=1034] Grief had settled in Emmaus just as it had in the city.
[time=1038] So we walked with a slow resignation that comes with grieving and with disappointment, as if walking through a fog.
[time=1045] We walked along in silence as long as we could.
[time=1048] Two men quietly mourning the death of a friend.
[time=1052] But then the silence itself began to become a weight we could no longer bear, and we began to speak.
[time=1058] Two men talking on a country road, remembering a dead friend.
[time=1063] Speaking softly, mourning the hopes we had buried with him.
[time=1068] And suddenly, out of our fog, a stranger appeared.
[time=1072] He walked slowly with us and heard our grief, somehow knew our fears.
[time=1077] And then he began to speak, and we could only listen.
[time=1081] We listened like children listening to a grandfather's story, our hearts hanging on every word with awe.
[time=1088] We listened as he revealed our buried hopes and taught us truth long concealed, the secret of the world's redeemer.
[time=1096] Our pace quickened, and our hearts were stirring within us as we approached the village.
[time=1101] We begged him to stay for dinner, and he accepted.
[time=1105] We washed our hands.
[time=1107] And he broke the bread, and our fog of grief burned away like the morning mist, as we saw him for who he is.
[time=1114] Our friend, Jesus, and the truth made flesh.
[time=1118] And we ran the seven miles back to Jerusalem with the truth burning in our hearts.
[time=1124] The fog has lifted.
[time=1126] Our friend, the secret of the ages, is alive.
[time=1130] We can see.
[time=1133] All at once he walked beside me, like he'd been there all along.
[time=1141] Not a stranger, but a father who can sense when something's wrong.
[time=1152] And he answered all my questions, and he understood my fears,
[time=1159] that somehow vanished now that he was near.
[time=1167] Can't you see who walks with you?
[time=1172] Can't you hear who speaks your name?
[time=1177] Can't you feel something stirring in your heart?
[time=1185] How his words brings me to you, like the ones from this stream.
[time=1196] Could the paths we follow from you?
[time=1204] Be the same.
[time=1224] I couldn't bear for him to leave me, so I begged him to stay.
[time=1231] Spend the evening a few moments before he went his way.
[time=1242] Then like a host he stood and blessed me, broke the bread and caught the wine.
[time=1250] Then there was something I knew I recognized.
[time=1256] Can't you hear who speaks my name?
[time=1265] I can feel something stirring in your heart.
[time=1274] How his words brings me to you, like the ones from this stream.
[time=1283] Could the paths we follow from you?
[time=1290] Be the same.
[time=1293] I couldn't bear for him to die.
[time=1352] My words brings me to you, like the ones from this stream.
[time=1362] And I know I'll never be the same.
[time=1372] I can't see my name.
[time=1396] Let's see.
[time=1416] Thank you, Susan.
[time=1418] We've come today to see that the resurrected Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1425] That he, as a person of history, physically arose from the grave.
[time=1433] And that he appeared unto two men on the way to Emmaus.
[time=1438] His disciples in an upper room, a gathering of followers on a seashore.
[time=1445] And in front of a crowd of more than 500 witnesses at one time, he was alive.
[time=1452] He was seen.
[time=1454] We today can see Jesus Christ with the eyes of faith as he's revealed in the Scriptures.
[time=1460] He is alive.
[time=1461] Do you know him today?
[time=1463] Our very purpose and meaning is to declare that you can know him, that you can see him, that he is alive.
[time=1472] This morning, that is our message that Jesus Christ is God, that he died for our sins, and the proof that he was God
[time=1481] was his victorious resurrection from the grave.
[time=1485] Today, we meet with that confidence.
[time=1488] By way of prayer, we would ask you this morning to be praying for George and Mary Lantman.
[time=1493] Mary went back to the hospital this week for a test, and obviously, very disappointing to all of us,
[time=1499] was that they found three small tumors in the area of her brain.
[time=1503] She's had some difficulty with mobility and with energy, and they've determined that this is their problem.
[time=1510] And they're doing some radiation therapy that they are saying will be 70 to 80 percent effective,
[time=1516] and we're praying to that end.
[time=1518] I want to ask you to pray with me now.
[time=1520] God, as we bow before you, we want to see Jesus Christ.
[time=1524] He is our hope, and we do have hope in life today.
[time=1528] We pray, particularly for Mary, that you have given to her a warrior spirit.
[time=1534] When we thank you for that, and pray this morning that you, as the God of all comfort, will put into her heart a continued peace and confidence.
[time=1543] We pray that you would cause this radiation therapy to be effective.
[time=1547] We pray that you will work in her body to restore her to energy, that she can return to the joy that has filled her life of serving you.
[time=1557] We pray for her partner, her lover in life, George.
[time=1561] That is a husband that you would give to his heart, confidence day by day, that as they fight the long battles that your energy would sustain them.
[time=1570] We pray for others in this body who are also suffering.
[time=1574] We pray particularly today for Bobby Cogden is her little baby Rachel is in the hospital.
[time=1580] We pray for Stan.
[time=1584] We pray for Catherine Northroom, particularly for Ralph Kramer as he is homebound.
[time=1590] God, to each of these that you would give to their hearts, confidence, and to their body's recovery.
[time=1596] Thank you for your word that teaches us that you care, and so today Father, we would want to know you, and we'd want to know your word that we would know your will.
[time=1607] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1610] [AMEN] Being a Bible studying church, I want to invite you to open your Bible with us this morning to first Corinthians, the third chapter.
[time=1620] And those of you who are with us last week, remember we started in chapter three, and we discovered that there is a spiritual condition of infancy.
[time=1630] That tragically and inappropriately, there are those who have been born again into the family of God, just as God planned it,
[time=1640] but they have never grown beyond spiritual infancy.
[time=1644] That condition is lamentable.
[time=1648] It is a condition that God teaches us in His Word is the opposite of what He wants.
[time=1655] What God wants from you and what God wants from me is for us to be growing Christians.
[time=1661] That day by day we're increasing in our knowledge, we're increasing in our service, we're increasing in our Christ likeness,
[time=1669] we're stretching out, we're like an athlete who always wants to go faster.
[time=1676] We're like a businessman who always wants to produce more, that we as believers in Christ are not willing to stay in spiritual infancy.
[time=1688] Now, when we meet someone who says I'm a Christian, but yet their life doesn't reflect that,
[time=1696] there's no attention to God's Word, there's no desire to worship Him, there's no instincts to obey Him,
[time=1704] then we have to ask a question, and there are two possible answers.
[time=1709] The question is how can that condition be for someone to be a believer in Christ and yet not living it and growing?
[time=1719] There are two possible answers. One is the high possibility that they really don't know Christ as Savior, they only know about Christ.
[time=1728] There's a big difference between knowing something and knowing about something.
[time=1734] Nine years ago I knew about marriage. Today I know marriage, and I'm glad for what I know.
[time=1744] There's a big difference, isn't there? Six years ago I knew about parenting.
[time=1749] Ken Nichols and I even teamed up and did a parenting seminar.
[time=1753] Now I have three kids and I know about parenting and I've stopped doing parenting seminars.
[time=1760] There's a difference between knowing something and knowing about something.
[time=1765] And it could be that many of us know all about Christ, but we really don't know Him, and that's why our lives aren't reflecting that.
[time=1774] That's one possible answer. There's a second possible answer, and that is what we discussed last week, that they do know Christ, but they're infants.
[time=1783] They've never grown, they've been believers a year, two years, in some cases ten years are close to a lifetime, but there's never been any growth, there's still spiritual infants.
[time=1794] You know, there's a lot of us who like being infants. Let's face it.
[time=1800] Some of us as men, we try to present this rugged, manly image that we watch football, but we like to be baby too, don't we?
[time=1810] Aren't those days when you're sick great? I don't mean when you're really sick, I mean just when you're kind of sick.
[time=1816] And you need your wife to take your temperature, and you need a little bit of help to change the channel on the television set.
[time=1824] Aren't those great days, I mean not when you're really sick, just when you're kind of sick. You get a little more attention, you get baby.
[time=1831] Our kids are smart. When we've stayed out late and they're in the backseat and the car coming home, they're often awake, but they play asleep.
[time=1842] You know why? Then they get carried into the house. It's great. I'm only 33, but I can remember doing that.
[time=1851] There's some advantages to being an infant or to being a child. You get cared for. Somebody else does the work.
[time=1859] And too often, many of us stay spiritual infants because we like to be babyed. We like someone to carry us.
[time=1868] We like it when this group over here takes care of all the administrative problems. This group over here does all the counseling.
[time=1875] This group over here does all the work to reach out for Christ. And our job is to fill the chair to make sure no one ever steals this chair on Sunday morning for 55 minutes.
[time=1886] And it better not be an hour and 10 minutes. I can only hold this thing down for 55. There's something attractive about being a child.
[time=1898] Somebody else carries the ball, but it's totally wrong. God expects us to grow and to serve and to be alive.
[time=1910] And just in case there were those that listened to the Apostle Paul described spiritual infancy and thought, hey, that's great.
[time=1917] The only thing I'm interested in is it heaven. I accept that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I've got my fire insurance policy in shape. That's all I'm interested in.
[time=1928] Why should the rest of us strive for Christ? When the next guy says, oh, I'll just let the church go.
[time=1935] I'll just let the evangelism program go. I'll just let somebody else worry about missions.
[time=1940] I'm just going to get away for the weekend, week after week. I don't care about growth. I don't care about service.
[time=1947] Why should this guy strive when this one doesn't? Why should this lady pour her life into service and this lady not if we're all going to make it to heaven?
[time=1956] Well, you're right. We're all going to make it to heaven if we've been born again, but we're not going to make it in the same condition.
[time=1965] We are not going to make it to heaven in the same condition. There is an event that will take place in the future called the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1977] And that is what Paul brings to the foreground to challenge those of us who are either spiritual infants or who as adults have decided to coast.
[time=1989] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11, "For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[time=2001] Now, if any man built upon this foundation, gold or silver, precious stone, wood, hay, or stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest.
[time=2017] For the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall test every man's work of what sort it is.
[time=2028] If any man's work abide which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward.
[time=2035] If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved yet as by fire."
[time=2044] No, ye not, that you are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[time=2053] If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[time=2059] For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are?
[time=2065] Here Paul has changed his analogy. He talked about the analogy, first of all, of spiritual growth being analogous to physical growth.
[time=2074] Then he changed the analogy to farming. He says, "A Paul is watered, I had planted, but God gave the increase."
[time=2083] And now he gives a third analogy, and that is the analogy of the building.
[time=2087] If you look back at verse 9, he says, "You are God's cultivated field, you are God's building."
[time=2095] Whatever you are, whether you be a cultivated field or whether you be a building, you belong to God.
[time=2102] Now in this analogy of being a builder, we saw last week that Paul said that I have been the architect.
[time=2110] He says, "The master builder." The Greek word is archetycan, which obviously we get the English word architect.
[time=2117] It refers not only to the man who rolls out the blueprints, but also the man who serves as what we would call the construction manager.
[time=2127] He got the project started. Paul said, "I as the master builder, I've come into your community and I preach the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[time=2136] but you're the building. You're the building." And he says, "Therefore, every one of us had better take heed how we build our lives."
[time=2148] Now in the verses we've just read, he follows through with this analogy of a building, and let me just give you some of the phases.
[time=2155] He talks about the foundation, a good starting point.
[time=2159] Then he talks about the building materials and the builder, and then finally, the thing that everyone who's in the construction industry loves, the building inspection.
[time=2171] Let's look at those in that order. In verse 11, he gives to us the foundation for the building of our lives.
[time=2179] You know it intuitively, don't you? Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=2190] Let me draw two things out of this. First and foremost, the obvious. Jesus Christ is the foundation.
[time=2198] If you've never received him as Savior, no matter how tall, how wide, how beautiful you build your life, it is determined by God that it will not last.
[time=2211] In Psalm 127 it says, "They that build a house, labor and vain, unless the Lord builds it."
[time=2223] You may be tremendous success in every area of your life, but if you failed to build that success on the appropriate foundation, you're in trouble.
[time=2234] For Jesus said, "There are two houses. The wise men build his house upon the rock, the other build it upon sand."
[time=2243] And when the events of testing came, the wind, the storms and the rain of life, the house that was built upon the right foundation stood, and the one built upon the sand was washed away.
[time=2260] If this passage teaches us anything, it teaches us first and foremost, that if we don't build our lives on Jesus Christ, it will not stand, that all of our labor is in vain.
[time=2273] You must be born again. There is no other name, the lady saying this morning, Acts chapter 4 verse 12, than the name of Jesus, because that is the only name given amongst mankind whereby we must be saved.
[time=2289] If you have not built your life on Christ today, it's time to move and to put your house on the right foundation.
[time=2298] Secondly, look at the little word "than." It says, "Other foundation can no man lay than."
[time=2307] That little word could also be, and I think better be, translated alongside. Other foundation can no man lay alongside the one that's already there, Jesus Christ.
[time=2320] I think there is a significant doctrinal warning there for all of us. And that is this. We live in an age of eclecticism where we take a little bit of this philosophy and a little bit of that philosophy and a little bit of this thought and we blend it all together.
[time=2336] And today the dilemma is not so much that people are rejecting Jesus Christ as the foundation. They're accepting a watered down Jesus Christ as the foundation.
[time=2347] Or they're accepting a polluted doctrine about Jesus Christ as the foundation.
[time=2353] The only foundation is the Jesus Christ that is presented in this book, the Bible, the Word of God. And no one can come along and lay anything down next to Him and say this is part of the foundation too.
[time=2372] If I'm speaking too generally, I'll speak specifically, and I trust graciously, but to the point.
[time=2382] There are those that teach that this is the foundation, and so is what Joseph Smith said, the foundation.
[time=2390] And they bring the two together, and this passage says, "Don't lay anything else along this foundation."
[time=2396] There are those that say this is the foundation, and what the church fathers have said over the years is the foundation.
[time=2405] Whatever the church fathers said or didn't say may or may not be true, but it is not the foundation.
[time=2412] There are those that teach whatever the Bible says and whatever my particular area of academic discipline says.
[time=2420] My field is a scientist, my field is an educator, my field is a lawyer, my field is a medical person.
[time=2427] Whatever it says is foundation, no.
[time=2431] Jesus Christ alone is the foundation, and you can lay nothing alongside of that as the par.
[time=2440] Christ alone is foundation.
[time=2443] Secondly, He now moves from the foundation to the builders.
[time=2447] He says, "Now, if any man build upon this foundation, the builders are anyone who has received that foundation.
[time=2456] If you've accepted Christ as your Savior, you've got the foundation, and now you become a builder."
[time=2463] You may have not known it, but you're in the construction business, how's it going?
[time=2468] You say, "Well, wait a minute. I don't want to get in this building business." It says, "If I'll opt out of the program, allow me to lay a little heavy language study on you."
[time=2479] In the Greek language, which the Bible's New Testament was inspired in, the Greeks have what are called four different classes of conditional clauses appropriately named.
[time=2491] First, second, and third, and fourth-class conditional clauses.
[time=2494] A first-class conditional clause is the only one that will lay on you today.
[time=2499] A first-class conditional clause is a condition of reality.
[time=2505] It does not say if, and maybe it will, maybe it won't.
[time=2509] It's saying if, and it is already true, then.
[time=2514] It is often translated since or when.
[time=2520] Look at it this way.
[time=2521] It's not if any man build upon this foundation.
[time=2524] It says, "Since every man is building upon this foundation, it's a condition of reality."
[time=2531] It is simply putting a condition in it saying, "Because this is happening, then this will follow."
[time=2538] You're the builder.
[time=2540] You're the contractor.
[time=2543] God says, "I've given you a life, and I've given you a new life, and now I expect you to take the gifts
[time=2550] and the foundation I've given you, and I expect you to build on it.
[time=2554] I don't expect you to stay spiritual infants.
[time=2557] I don't expect you to stay in uncultivated field, and I don't expect you to stay in unbuilt building."
[time=2564] God says, "I expect you to grow to maturity." God says, "I expect you to be a cultivated field that bears forth fruit." God says, "I expect you to be a skyscraper." Expect you to be a building.
[time=2578] And then He gives us the building materials.
[time=2582] Obviously, there's a sharp disparity between the list.
[time=2587] On the one hand, He says, "There is gold, silver, and precious stone, and then there are these three others, wood, hay, and stubble."
[time=2598] Well, the comparisons between the two lists are numerous.
[time=2601] To begin with, one list is extremely valuable.
[time=2606] The other list is very, very common, and not valuable to any significant degree.
[time=2615] You can build a house out of precious stones like marble and granite.
[time=2620] You can trim it with gold and silver, and that's one thing.
[time=2623] But you can build a house out of wood, hay, and stubble.
[time=2626] You can.
[time=2628] But there's a big difference.
[time=2630] This is more valuable.
[time=2632] Gold is valuable.
[time=2634] Hay is not.
[time=2636] You'll never get up in the morning, open up the newspaper, and say, "Last night, hay fell on the European market."
[time=2645] You won't wake up in the morning and get the prices of stubble per ounce.
[time=2651] They're not valuable.
[time=2654] The gold and the silver and the precious stones are valuable.
[time=2658] You'll never see a newly engaged girl come and say, "Oh, isn't this a gorgeous ring here that my boyfriend gave me?
[time=2664] It's a band of straw with a piece of stubble right in the middle, three carrots worth." You say, "You're kidding. That's absurd." Well, it's invaluable.
[time=2674] That's right.
[time=2677] There are things that you can build your life out of that have tremendous value.
[time=2680] There are others that have very little value at all.
[time=2683] Here's another point of comparison.
[time=2685] It's very easy to get and to find.
[time=2688] The other is very difficult.
[time=2691] To my knowledge as a history major, I do not remember a significant time in the history of America where there was a hay rush.
[time=2699] I remember a few gold rushes, but not very many hay rushes.
[time=2705] Gold is very difficult to find.
[time=2708] It's very difficult to mine.
[time=2710] It's very difficult to refine and to purify, but when you've got it, you've got something of value.
[time=2716] It's very difficult to lay your hands on gold.
[time=2720] Unfortunately, hay grows everywhere, including the cracks in the sidewalk where it seems to sprout up the best.
[time=2729] There's another point of comparison.
[time=2731] One is enduring.
[time=2733] The other is quickly perishing.
[time=2736] Wood is a fine product to build your house with, but you better paint it, or you better cover it with aluminum, or you better treat it.
[time=2744] If you don't, it will decay fast.
[time=2747] It will lose its construction-worthy properties in a very short period of time.
[time=2753] But you and I, should we have the opportunity, could travel the world and we could see marble buildings, parts of which are standing through thousands and thousands of years of time.
[time=2765] Because of the quality of the material.
[time=2769] What's the point?
[time=2771] The point is, God has given us a foundation, and now we are building upon it, and the question is, what are we using for the building materials?
[time=2781] Are we using precious building materials that have value?
[time=2785] Though they'd be hard to get, they'll last forever.
[time=2787] Are we just building a little lean-to that isn't going to last?
[time=2794] Numbers of writers have suggested, what is it that is the spiritual counterpart to the golden silver?
[time=2801] I have found two suggestions, and I believe they're both true.
[time=2805] The first suggestion is this, that the precious materials are the things that we do out of service for Christ.
[time=2814] It's those times when a friend needed a word of encouragement, and we went out of our way to be that encourager.
[time=2822] It is those times when there was a need to teach an early morning Sunday school class, and we said I'll do that.
[time=2829] It is the times when someone was alone and we visited them.
[time=2834] It is everything that we do for the glory of Christ.
[time=2839] It is the day that someone falsely accuses us, and we take it, though it be false, without growing bitter.
[time=2848] It is the times that we are rejected, and we still remain accepting.
[time=2853] It is the times in our life when we've been hurt and crushed and bruised, and instead of becoming bitter and broken, we become sweet.
[time=2862] That's the gold, that's the silver, that's the precious stone.
[time=2870] The wood hay and stubble are all those noble plans that we have had and achieved on our own, apart from God, that won't last.
[time=2884] It's what we do.
[time=2886] Secondly, it's why we do it.
[time=2889] There is also the inherent danger that we may do the right thing for the wrong reason.
[time=2896] If we do that, we have the tragic habit of taking that which could be gold and turning it into stubble.
[time=2904] Presee, it is totally possible for you or for me to do the wrong thing, and that be wood, but it's totally possible for us to do the right thing, and it's still to be wood hay and stubble, because we did it with the wrong motive.
[time=2920] You see, sometimes we do the right thing, but we do it not because it's the right thing to do, and because God wants us to do it, we do it because we know that the right people are looking, and they'll notice, and we'll get a little bit more of attention.
[time=2934] And that's the wrong reason.
[time=2937] Jesus said there are those who went out in the streets and they prayed, but they prayed so that others would see them pray, and Jesus said they've already received their reward.
[time=2948] That's it.
[time=2949] There's not going to be any lasting reward for them, because what they did, they did it to be a spectacle to others.
[time=2955] If that's the reward they want, they've got it, the account's closed.
[time=2963] And then finally, and most importantly, I believe he talks not only about the builder and the building material, but he talks about the building inspector.
[time=2974] I've done a little bit of building, and fortunately there were building inspectors.
[time=2982] There was a building inspector that came on the lot, and he made sure the lot was able to support the type of structure that was being proposed.
[time=2991] Soil samples were done, and inspection was made.
[time=2995] A foundation was put in, and before anything could be put on it, the inspector came and investigated the foundation.
[time=3003] Then the whole house was roughed in.
[time=3006] Three or four different inspectors came.
[time=3009] One electrical, one plumbing, one general.
[time=3014] Before we could finish the house, a final inspection had to be made.
[time=3019] Life is full of inspections, isn't it?
[time=3022] I know I would have done better in school if they hadn't inspected me on spelling.
[time=3027] I know I would have done much better in sports if there weren't these inspectors who we call referees, officials, umpires.
[time=3037] If they really didn't mind me doing a little freestyle in the middle of the breaststroke, I know I could have caught up and beat those guys.
[time=3044] But there were these officials who inspected that and disqualified it.
[time=3050] God says, "I am going to inspect the building that you build."
[time=3057] Look at this verse, verse 13, "Every man's work shall be inspected.
[time=3063] It'll be made manifest. It will be revealed." Every writer I have ever read says that this passage is also parallel to 2 Corinthians chapter 5, where Paul said these words.
[time=3078] "No, ye not, that we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
[time=3085] In the Bible, there are a number of future judgments.
[time=3088] One is the judgment of angels.
[time=3091] Somehow, I'm not really worried about that one.
[time=3094] There's a second judgment called the Great White Throne Judgment.
[time=3098] By God's grace, I don't need to worry about that one.
[time=3101] Because that is a judgment of everyone who's never received Christ as Savior.
[time=3105] I hope you don't have to worry about that one, but here's a third major judgment yet in the future.
[time=3110] And that is the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3113] And every person will stand before Christ as judge.
[time=3117] Those who've never received him on their occasion will stand before him when he sits on the right throne.
[time=3122] And he evaluates their works and says, "You've sinned." And they're separated from eternity from God in hell.
[time=3132] Those who are not before him there will set before him not when he's on his white throne, but on what the Bible calls the "beymah seat." A different judgment seat.
[time=3142] And all of us, he'll say, "Well, you've sinned, but it's been forgiven by God's grace.
[time=3147] I'll accept you into my kingdom.
[time=3149] And now I'm going to judge you not to determine whether to accept you or not accept you,
[time=3155] because you're already accepted into heaven.
[time=3157] But I'm going to judge what you've done with what I've given you.
[time=3160] And I'm going to inspect your building." He says, "These words, 'Every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it.'"
[time=3170] That day is the day when Christ comes again.
[time=3173] That's the day of the Lord.
[time=3175] And when we're taken to heaven, there's a great tribulation on earth.
[time=3179] And in heaven, there's the judgment seat of Christ, where we're going to appear right before him.
[time=3185] The Bible then says, "The day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire." Fire is a symbol of judgment.
[time=3192] And let's apply that judgment to the building materials.
[time=3195] Well, if you take gold and you submit it to the test of fire, what's going to happen?
[time=3200] Well, it's going to get better.
[time=3202] That gold's going to be refined.
[time=3204] The dross will be consumed and the gold refined and it'll be more precious.
[time=3209] What you've done when God tested it is going to be more precious than the day you did it.
[time=3214] If you take marble and you submit it to fire, it isn't going to hurt it at all.
[time=3218] It's going to stand solid.
[time=3220] If you take wood, hay, or stubble and you submit it to fire, stand back.
[time=3225] It's going to get very hot.
[time=3228] But in a moment, it'll get cool again when there's nothing left but ashes.
[time=3234] God says, "I'm going to take your building.
[time=3236] I'm going to take what I have given you and I'm going to evaluate what you have done with it.
[time=3240] And I'm going to hit it with fire and we'll see what it is." Now remember, these are all believers.
[time=3250] And let me take the last phrase first.
[time=3253] In verse 15 it says, "In no matter how you come through that test, you will be saved."
[time=3259] Because Christ died for you.
[time=3261] You've accepted him.
[time=3262] You'll have nothing but a foundation, but you'll be saved.
[time=3267] Now, there are two statements that are made here.
[time=3270] It says, "When that fire comes, if you've used the right building materials, if you build on that life,
[time=3276] then there's going to be a reward for you in heaven." I think there's at least these three rewards.
[time=3282] First and foremost in my mind is this reward.
[time=3285] It is the reward of hearing Jesus Christ say, "Well done.
[time=3290] Good job." Remember as he dispensed the talents and those that went out and they used them and they used them properly,
[time=3299] that the first thing their master said unto them is, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." More than anything else I want to hear.
[time=3308] Jesus say to me, "And Jesus to say to you, 'Well done.'"
[time=3315] Well done.
[time=3318] There's a second reward.
[time=3320] That is the reward of a crown.
[time=3322] Two Greek words for crown.
[time=3324] One is diadem.
[time=3325] That is a royal crown.
[time=3326] Only Christ will wear that one.
[time=3328] Second word is Stephanus from which we get the name Stephen and Stephanie.
[time=3331] It means a victor's crown.
[time=3333] When you're victorious in this life for Christ's sake, he'll have a crown for you.
[time=3338] A third reward is this one that I'll believe he'll have a reign for you.
[time=3343] The Bible says that if we suffer with Christ, we shall also reign with Christ.
[time=3348] He said to the servants who did well, "You've been faithful over little, I will make you faithful over much." I don't know what heaven's going to be like, but there's going to be levels of leadership where there will be those that reign
[time=3359] and the termination of who will reign will be determined by who is faithful here.
[time=3365] Not who is effective necessarily.
[time=3367] Not who is successful necessarily.
[time=3369] Not who is gifted necessarily.
[time=3371] Not who is visible necessarily, but who is faithful.
[time=3377] Like the widow who gave two mites, she was faithful.
[time=3382] Like the man who had a few talents and used them, he was faithful.
[time=3388] Faithfulness.
[time=3391] Those are the three rewards that I know of.
[time=3394] But then notice this phrase too.
[time=3396] It says, "He shall suffer loss." If his works are consumed, he'll suffer loss.
[time=3402] Not the loss of your salvation, but the loss of your reward.
[time=3406] I don't know all that that means either, but I know it means at least this much.
[time=3411] That when Christ looks at our lives, he won't be able to say, "Well done."
[time=3418] You'll have to say, "What have you done?" "What have you done?" "It gave you my son, and what have you done?" And we will stand there naked before him, found out.
[time=3435] That will be a great suffering of loss.
[time=3441] The reward or the loss is determined on how we live today, which will it be.
