[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hours.
[time=69] Now, live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=75] it's the Bible Hour, with inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups,
[time=81] and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=87] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hours.

[time=210] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=214] It is a joy this day to welcome you to our services, and trusting that God will use our time together to encourage you in your spiritual walk with Christ.
[time=224] It's great to hear the orchestra playing, the choir singing, and most of all, to see your faces this morning as we've come to worship together.
[time=233] A part of our meeting together is not just to hear music, nor to sing it, nor to study the word, but to fellowship together.
[time=241] We're delighted that you're here.
[time=243] We want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible Hour, and encourage each of you to be growing in the Lord and growing in fellowship.
[time=251] Let's right now take this opportunity to fellowship together.
[time=254] Let's stand right now, greet those around you, say, hello to each other, if you don't know the people around you, introduce yourselves.
[time=288] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=291] I hope that you got to know some people today, encourage them, and you were encouraged as I look out there.
[time=297] So many people, I see a friend who is here today who was in the hospital last Sunday.
[time=301] That's always encouraging to see.
[time=303] There are one or two ladies who are here today who wish they were in the hospital this Sunday, giving birth, their hour will come, but you've come today to worship.
[time=312] We're thankful that you're here.
[time=314] We want all that we do to bring honor to the name of our Lord.
[time=317] Our choir is going to sing a medley of songs put together called "Honor the Lord."
[time=325] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=545] And that's our attempt each Sunday here to honor the Lord with our voices as we lift them to Him.
[time=554] Let's continue our music by turning to Him number 13, crown Him with many crowns, Him number 13.
[time=561] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=681] Thank you very much for your good singing and both services we had exceptional congregational singing.
[time=690] We do appreciate the fact that you participate and bless our hearts as we sing together as a body of believers.
[time=697] The choir sang "Honor the Lord" medley this morning.
[time=701] We honor the Lord with our hymns.
[time=703] Now, Geraldin's going to come and sing a spiritual.
[time=706] Black spirituals have been around America for a long time.
[time=709] They usually connoted two ideas.
[time=712] One would be that the slaves would communicate to one another concerning underground escape routes for the slaves to get out of the south.
[time=722] And also it was frequently found where the mother would sit with the young child and communicate biblical truths through the medium of music.
[time=730] Let's listen now as Geraldin sings the spiritual entitled "Honor Honor." [MUSIC - 121 seconds]
[time=885] We would like to talk to you about doing us a favor.
[time=889] One of the things that is a special encouragement to those of us who labor here in the Bible are to hear from you.
[time=896] Many of you are watching in Marion, Indiana and in South Bend, Indiana and we would love to hear from you.
[time=902] As a matter of fact, this past week we had a great testimony as to how God has used the Bible hour.
[time=907] Pete, when we had baptism last week, they're always good, but last week was particularly special, wasn't it?
[time=913] Yes, when a young man in his middle age comes and acknowledges publicly.
[time=918] Oh, he's very young, he was about my age.
[time=921] It comes publicly to acknowledge that Jesus Christ is a savior and then is baptized before our congregation.
[time=927] That's a great sign and a really a trusting step that this man has taken at that particular age.
[time=934] And a particular interest to me when I talked to him personally was I asked him, "How did you happen to come to our church here?"
[time=941] And he said, "The only real contact I had was through the Bible hour." He had watched our television ministry and he had come because of that.
[time=947] I think there are many people that are out watching the Bible hour and don't really have a church home and those are the people to whom we like to minister to introduce them to Jesus Christ and eventually invite them to come to our church to fellowship with the believers that are here.
[time=962] Obviously for those of you in Marion and in South Bend and outlying areas, coming here is not a possibility.
[time=968] And we're not really trying to build our church, we're trying to build Jesus Christ church.
[time=973] And if you've come to know Christ is your personal savior, you're a part of that body.
[time=978] I'd like to ask you today to write to us if you've been watching the Bible hour and if God's been using it in your life,
[time=984] perhaps you've accepted Christ or it's been of some special ministry to you, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=990] Pete, would you tell our friends how they can write?
[time=992] Yes, we'd like to encourage all of our viewers to write to the Bible hour.
[time=997] The address is box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1003] That's the Bible hour.
[time=1005] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1010] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1011] And when you write, we'd like to send you a booklet entitled, with the simple one word title, "Woman."
[time=1017] It has been written by Charles Swindall, the fine Bible teacher out of Fullerton, California, who many of you here on the radio with his program, "Insights for Living." Pastor Swindall writes this book about what the Bible says is the role of a woman.
[time=1032] The Bible places it as a high, elevated, and exalted position to be the design that God has made you to be as a woman.
[time=1040] We'd like to send you a copy of this for your reading.
[time=1043] Please, men write as well. It'll teach us what God says is the role of our wives, how we should treat our mothers.
[time=1050] We want to send it to you.
[time=1052] Once again, our address is the Bible hour box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and our zip code is 46815.
[time=1071] Pete, next Sunday, we have a special musical guest with us.
[time=1074] Yes, we've had Paul Schumacher, tenor soloist, several times at Black Hawk Baptist Church, but he's coming again. He hasn't been here for several years.
[time=1082] Paul is a great singer. He's had some difficulty with physical ailments and the way of cancer.
[time=1088] He just recently had an operation, and he really has a great testimony for the Lord and a beautiful voice, and we encourage you to tune in, or better yet even come and listen to Paul Schumacher as he ministers to us next week.
[time=1100] Thank you for joining us today, and we would love to hear from you.
[time=1104] If you made a significant decision for Christ, or the Bible hour has been a special ministry to you,
[time=1110] we would ask you to write so we can share that good news with the many people here who are working hard to make the Bible hour possible.
[time=1118] Again, one final time our address is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1133] In my darkness Jesus found me, touched my eyes and made me see.
[time=1155] I broke since chains that long had bound me, gave me life and liberty.
[time=1169] A Fourier's love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made him soon to save a soul like mine.
[time=1182] All my days and then in heaven of power, my song of sight is never a worshiping power of love,
[time=1196] and praise him for his loyal soul.
[time=1209] Me whom angel hosts attend, who art of heaven, God's son, what wonder.
[time=1222] He became the sinner's friend, the love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made him soon to save a soul like mine.
[time=1242] All my days and then in heaven of power, my song of sight is never a worshiping power of love,
[time=1255] and praise him for his loyal power, my song of sight is never a worshiping power of love,
[time=1268] and praise him for his loyal soul, and praise him for his loyal soul.
[time=1283] And praise him for his loyal soul.
[time=1298] May it be that our song will silence never.
[time=1311] God, you have put a new song in our heart the day that Jesus Christ came in.
[time=1318] You've taken fear and replaced it with hope.
[time=1322] You've taken self and replaced it with Christ, and we want that new song to ring out.
[time=1328] Father put within us a spirit that rings with the music of Christ.
[time=1333] As a world with listen, Christ's message can be heard, God may it be heard in our lives.
[time=1341] We want to sing for you, and our daily lives may it be music to a watching world.
[time=1348] Father, we thank you for your word today, and as we have come to study it, we invite you to teach.
[time=1354] Father, as you have prepared in my heart, so I ask you now to guide my mouth.
[time=1360] May the words that I speak and the thoughts that each one of us entertain be acceptable in your sight.
[time=1367] May your words feed us.
[time=1369] May they be sweet, sweeter than honey in the honeycomb.
[time=1374] May they be precious or precious than gold.
[time=1379] Father, today, may your word build into our lives upon the foundation that has been laid, which is Christ Jesus.
[time=1387] We pray that you would build strength into each life, particularly today we pray for those who are in the middle of a serious spiritual battle.
[time=1396] We pray for those believers who are married to unbelievers.
[time=1400] We pray for wives whose husbands believe not, that you would give them the gracious ability to be a first Peter III wife,
[time=1409] winning by their winsome conduct.
[time=1413] We pray for men whose wives don't believe, that you would teach them to love their wives as you would love them and so by that avenue to draw them to Christ.
[time=1425] God, we pray that you would help us to be peacemakers in our homes.
[time=1432] We pray for those whose teenagers and whose children walk in disobedience that you'll give wisdom to parents and the ability to suffer long.
[time=1443] Father, today, we pray for those who are physically afflicted. Pray for Dick Jackson, Mary Lantman.
[time=1451] We pray today for those who have suffered from chronic illnesses like Marv and Bill, Catherine.
[time=1460] God, give each heart strength and courage for each day.
[time=1464] We pray that there be physical relief for many whose burdens have been long.
[time=1470] Father, today, through your word put within us a heart of obedience to you.
[time=1476] Through your word now, teach us, God, that we might be in a closer walk with you.
[time=1484] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1488] Pastor Ray Steadman of the Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto, California tells this story.
[time=1496] A young lady came up to him as he was speaking at the Christian Airline Personnel Conference, a very attractive young lady who came and thanked Dr. Steadman for his messages that had been so encouraging to her.
[time=1510] She said, "We live on the front line. The attacks on our character and our commitment to Christ are daily."
[time=1517] She shared this experience.
[time=1520] It was familiar to her to have a passenger on an airplane make an insinuating comment with some very clear overtones.
[time=1529] But one time, one man's overt statement was more than she could handle. She walked away embarrassed and hurt.
[time=1540] She didn't know how to react, and she knew that in just a few moments she would have to go back into that same part of the cabin and serve him the meal.
[time=1550] She didn't know whether to ignore it, to say anything, or to brace herself for his next remark.
[time=1556] She prayed, and a verse of Scripture came to her mind.
[time=1559] And so she immediately walked up to that same individual and said, "Sir, I know what you said to me, and I know exactly what you were implying.
[time=1566] And I just thought you should know something. I've asked Jesus Christ to be my Savior.
[time=1571] And he lives in my heart, and the Bible says that I am his temple.
[time=1575] And what I thought you would like to know is that the Bible says this, "If any man defiles God's temple, him will God destroy."
[time=1583] Immediately, the embarrassment changed from her to him, and the words of apology could not stop coming for it.
[time=1596] The Bible does say that.
[time=1598] Whosoever defiles the temple of God, him will God destroy.
[time=1603] Let us look at that passage together.
[time=1605] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and beginning at verse 16.
[time=1609] We've been studying for several weeks now through the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1613] We're taking our time, we're moving verse by verse, so as to teach the entirety of what God's Word would say.
[time=1620] Today we look at 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verses 16 through 23.
[time=1626] No ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.
[time=1637] If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
[time=1651] Let no man deceive himself.
[time=1655] If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool.
[time=1662] That he may be wise.
[time=1665] For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written.
[time=1674] He takeeth the wise in their own craftiness, and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain.
[time=1686] Therefore let no man glory in men.
[time=1691] For all things are yours, whether Paul, or Paulus, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours.
[time=1707] And ye are Christ, and Christ is God's.
[time=1716] In this particular passage there is that great statement that we are God's temple, and that anyone who defiles the temple, God will destroy.
[time=1726] As we look at this passage, let us focus our thoughts on two questions.
[time=1731] One, what is the temple of God, and then two, how is the temple of God defiled?
[time=1739] Paul begins with what we would call, grammatically, a rhetorical question.
[time=1744] He says, "No ye not that." Now a rhetorical question is not one that you give, hoping to get an answer to supply you information you don't know at this point.
[time=1756] A rhetorical question is something you ask someone else to gain their attention, and it's usually something like this, don't you know, and of course you do.
[time=1767] For example, you walk around the corner from your kitchen into your family room, and there are your children repotting your plants for you.
[time=1775] And you say, "What are you doing?" Now if you're a parent like myself, you really don't want an answer to that question.
[time=1784] You know exactly what they are doing, and you're trying to get their attention to realize that you don't want them to be doing what they're doing.
[time=1793] What are you doing? A rhetorical question.
[time=1797] Here Paul says, "No ye not," and the answer is of course you know.
[time=1801] But he says, "No ye not that you are the temple of God."
[time=1807] Where does God live?
[time=1811] Well the Bible tells us very clearly that God is so transcendent, so big, so other that he lives everywhere, nothing can contain him.
[time=1822] The apostle Paul said in the New Testament, as he went to the city of Athens, he said, "You're a very religious people.
[time=1831] I saw you at a temple to this God, and to this God, and a shrine to this God, and an altar over here." And in case you missed anyone, here was a temple to the unknown God.
[time=1842] Paul says, "Him, whom you ignorantly worship, I declare unto you, a God who dwells not in temples made with hands."
[time=1852] God can't live in a building, least of all gymnasium.
[time=1857] But yet there was a sense in the Old Testament and New Testament where God didn't have it something very specifically.
[time=1863] Now don't misunderstand, the Old Testament also said that God doesn't live in a house.
[time=1868] Solomon built the temple, beautiful, splendid, magnificent, like nothing else in history.
[time=1874] But here's what he said of his own temple that he made for God, 1 Kings 8, 27.
[time=1881] "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house that I have built."
[time=1894] God doesn't live in temples, he doesn't live in buildings, he doesn't inhabit shrines.
[time=1900] But yet there was a sense in the Old Testament where God's presence was physically seen.
[time=1909] We call it the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=1913] Forgive me for using a foreign word to you, but it's a Hebrew word that is used often in biblical studies.
[time=1919] Shekinah glory of God, the word Shekinah is a Hebrew word which means to appear or to be seen.
[time=1926] So when we talk about the Shekinah glory of God, we're talking about the dimension to God's glory that can be seen.
[time=1933] Let's review a little history.
[time=1936] Do you remember one time when God's glory was seen?
[time=1939] When Moses went up on the mountain, he saw the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=1943] He saw the glory of God as it was seen on the Mount Sinai.
[time=1949] When he came down, Israel saw the glory of God because his face was illuminated with the glory of God.
[time=1956] At a later point when they built the tabernacle, that transportable, movable place of congregational meeting,
[time=1964] the Shekinah glory of God would dwell there and they would see it.
[time=1968] When the temple was built, it says that the Shekinah glory of God inhabited and they could see it.
[time=1974] In Jesus we beheld his glory.
[time=1977] We could see God in his glory in Christ.
[time=1980] And even immensely more could it be seen on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[time=1986] But today, God's glory is still present and it is still seen, not in a tabernacle, not in a temple, not in Moses, but in you.
[time=1997] And in me.
[time=2001] The Bible says that God lives in us.
[time=2007] We are his temple.
[time=2011] Perhaps someone shared with you that you could come to Christ as Savior.
[time=2016] Maybe they quoted this verse.
[time=2018] Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and will open the door, Jesus said, "I will come in."
[time=2029] Christ said, "I will come and I will live in you. I will make my abode your body.
[time=2035] I'll move in and take residence in you." Paul said to the church in Colossians chapter 1, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=2046] The Bible says to as many as receive him, Christ can be received into you.
[time=2053] In 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verses 14 through 19, it again tells us that God lives within us.
[time=2061] It says, "Be not unequally yoked." Now that's an analogy out of farming.
[time=2068] And I am a city slicker, so I have to borrow my insights.
[time=2073] A yoke, we can picture that. That's this piece of wood that harnesses two animals together.
[time=2078] Now, in the agrarian world, to unequally yoke animals meant to take two animals that weren't compatible and to lock them together.
[time=2088] For example, you might take a big, tall, full-sized horse built for plowing, something strong and huge like a Clydesdale.
[time=2100] Well, you can't take that big, mammoth horse and yoke it together with a little burrow with these short little legs.
[time=2108] Why this big horse will just plodd right along and strong strokes in this poor little burrow with the short little legs like Pete Coby will just keep plodding along.
[time=2121] You can't do that. You've got a yoke equal sizes together.
[time=2127] Now, what's the Bible saying by way of application? We're not farmers.
[time=2131] Oh, few of you may be, but most of you aren't plowing with horses.
[time=2135] Maybe a few of our only friends, but they don't have television, so they're not watching today.
[time=2140] What does it mean? By application, it means this.
[time=2144] The God says, "I don't want a believer locking themselves together with an unbeliever because that's an unequal yoke,
[time=2152] because the believer has Christ living in them."
[time=2158] And Christ says, "I don't want to be locked together with someone who has denied me and rejected me."
[time=2164] Why? Because we are the temple.
[time=2168] Christ and the Spirit of God dwells in every person who was born again into the kingdom of God.
[time=2178] Now, unless you think this is all spiritual, remember that 1 Corinthians 6, 19 says, "No, ye not," and you do another rhetorical question, that your body is the temple of God.
[time=2189] Not just as the Spirit of God present in your spirit, but your body belongs to God, and it is His temple.
[time=2201] You're a walking, breathing, consuming temple of God.
[time=2207] You are the temple.
[time=2210] Christ lives in you if you have been born again into the family of God.
[time=2216] You must recognize that Jesus Christ was God in human form.
[time=2222] Although it does not mathematically work out, that he was 100% human.
[time=2227] He got tired, he got hungry, he got thirsty, he cried, he was human, but at the same time he was 100% God.
[time=2235] He was God in flesh, incarnate.
[time=2239] We call it the incarnation.
[time=2241] You must believe that Christ Jesus was God in human form, and that He died on the cross as a substitute for your sins.
[time=2251] And by faith, believe on Him and receive Him into your heart.
[time=2255] Then the Bible says, "You are born again, and the Spirit of God dwells in you, and you are His temple."
[time=2261] What is the temple? The temple is two things.
[time=2265] First of all, it is the individual believer who has been born again.
[time=2269] Let me ask you a question, not rhetorical, one that I want you to answer to yourself.
[time=2275] Are you the temple of God?
[time=2277] Is God's Spirit living in you?
[time=2280] I don't mean have you come to church here.
[time=2282] I don't mean do you attend Sunday school.
[time=2285] I don't mean have you labored here, but I mean have you personally said Jesus Christ.
[time=2290] I know I'm a sinner. I want you to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins.
[time=2295] That's how you become the temple.
[time=2298] The temple is the individual believer.
[time=2300] But secondly, the temple is not only the individual believer, but the temple is the church.
[time=2306] Now put quotes around that word church, would you please?
[time=2310] When I speak of the church, I'm not speaking of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2315] God doesn't live here.
[time=2317] When we leave the building and we shut off the lights, we don't say good night, God have a good night and he stays.
[time=2323] It's not the building.
[time=2327] When we talk about the church, we mean any assembly of believers together in the name of Jesus.
[time=2336] Matthew 18 verse 20, Jesus said, where two or three are gathered in my name, there he says, I am in the midst of them.
[time=2347] The church is the body of Christ.
[time=2350] It can be this body of people we've assembled today in Jesus name.
[time=2354] It may be our friends way down south in Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, assembled in Jesus name.
[time=2362] It might be those at the Evangelical Free Church of Fullerton, California, assembled in Jesus name.
[time=2370] The church is the meeting together of the body of Christ.
[time=2375] We today, not just as individuals, but collectively together as a body of Christ, we are the church.
[time=2385] I believe that in this passage, there's our primary concern, 1 Corinthians 3, Paul is now referencing not so much the individual believer, but the church as the temple of God.
[time=2398] If you'll notice in verse 16, all of these use are referencing a plural you, a collective body of people.
[time=2410] No, ye not, ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you.
[time=2416] Those are all plurals.
[time=2418] And the temple that is being referred to here is, yes, the individual, but primarily the collective body.
[time=2427] And based upon that insight that we are as body, he gives this important implication.
[time=2438] He says, verse 17, if any man defile the temple, him will God destroy?
[time=2449] Wow, that's powerful.
[time=2452] Let me give you one grammatical observation.
[time=2455] You may even want to note this in your Bible.
[time=2458] If you'll look at that little word, defile.
[time=2461] I'm circling it in mine right now. And then the little word destroy and circle that.
[time=2468] Those are the same word in the great New Testament.
[time=2471] The authors of the King James Bible simply by way of interpretation gave them different translations, but it's the exact same word in Greek that occurs twice.
[time=2484] So it would probably be more desirable to translate the Bible in one of two ways.
[time=2490] Either say, whoever defiles the temple of God, him will God defile, or whoever destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy.
[time=2501] I believe what it's saying is what the Bible says in Galatians chapter 5, excuse me, chapter 6 in verse 7.
[time=2511] Be not deceived. God is not mocked whatsoever a man so's that shall he also reap.
[time=2519] That again is an analogy on a farming that if you sow something, you're going to reap the same thing.
[time=2525] This year we planted broccoli. Broccoli came up. No surprises.
[time=2530] No cauliflower. Why? We didn't plant cauliflower.
[time=2533] Whatever you sow, that's what you're going to reap.
[time=2536] If you're not into farming, you will understand this expression. We hear it all the time. What goes around comes around.
[time=2542] What God is saying here is whatever you send out, that's what I'm going to send back to you.
[time=2548] And here is a severe warning in the scriptures that if any individual defiles the body of Christ, God will pay him back in kind.
[time=2564] What does the word defile then mean?
[time=2567] Let me give you two other uses of it apart from the Bible.
[time=2571] A man by the name of Euripides used this word to describe the violating or the dishonoring of women.
[time=2580] It means to dishonor, to violate.
[time=2584] A man by the name of Plutarch, a little more common as a writer, said that when someone took a pure color, an expensive dye of a precious color like purple,
[time=2597] and they tried to mix in something with it, that they polluted it, or they defiled it.
[time=2605] That's what the basic meaning of the word defile is.
[time=2610] The use the word translated, destroy, may be fair, but not so common as to pollute or to mar or to violate.
[time=2621] Now here the Bible says if anyone defiles the temple, him will God defile.
[time=2630] How do you defile the temple? That's our second question today.
[time=2634] I believe in the verses that follow, Paul wanted us to know how the body can be defiled and to be warned.
[time=2642] Verse 17 says God will defile the one who defiles the temple for the temple of God is holy.
[time=2654] Not that those of us who are Christians are righteous people that were better than you.
[time=2660] No, not at all, not at all. It is simply that we have been washed.
[time=2666] You see, the Bible says that my sin covered me like a dark, unattractive stain,
[time=2676] and that no bleach, no whiteners, no additives, no enzymes, no proteins,
[time=2682] no super improved anything is going to take it out. That's stained.
[time=2690] Nothing except for the blood of his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2695] God said I can take those stains, I can take those stains and I can wash them, and I can make them as white as snow, as clean as fresh wool.
[time=2706] But it will cost me my son. It costs God his son to wash us and to set us apart as holy.
[time=2719] And so he has a very high investment in keeping it holy.
[time=2725] And so he says if anyone takes that, which I have cleansed and made holy, by the blood of my son,
[time=2734] him why defile and kind, what is holiness, this purity, to break holiness in a word is sin.
[time=2746] What defiles the body of Christ sin more than anything else?
[time=2754] What does God do with sin? Yes, he forgives it, but you need to be warned that God also punishes sin in the life of a believer.
[time=2763] Will God defile you? Will he destroy you? Will he send you to hell if you are a believer? No.
[time=2768] It says in verse 15, we've already read when your judge, your works may go up in smoke, but you will be saved.
[time=2775] But you may bring upon yourself some very traumatic physical consequences in life today.
[time=2781] I know of no more gripping illustration of that than Acts chapter 5.
[time=2786] In Acts chapter 4, Barnabas sees the church as in desperate need and he sells some of his land,
[time=2792] gives the money to the apostles, the apostles distribute it to those that have need and everyone's encouraged.
[time=2798] A husband and wife say, well that was really great, a Barnabas to do that.
[time=2802] In fact, he got an awful lot of attention. Why don't we do the same?
[time=2806] So they took a piece of property that they had, they sold their property, came to the disciples and said,
[time=2812] we've sold the land and here is all the money when it wasn't all the money.
[time=2819] The spirit gives insight into Peter and Peter said, before you sold that ground, wasn't it yours to do with whatever you wanted?
[time=2828] Retorical question, yes. And when you sold the ground, wasn't the money yours and you could do with it whatever you wanted to?
[time=2836] Yes, why did you lie to God? Why did you say this is the whole price when it's only a part?
[time=2843] You didn't have to give anything, you could have given little or a lot, but you lied and said it was all and they dropped dead.
[time=2851] The husband first, the wife came in, the same scenario was repeated and she drops dead.
[time=2858] Why would God do that? Because the early church was pure and its purity was being threatened by hypocrisy and lying and God dealt with it instantly.
[time=2871] God doesn't always deal instantly, does he? But he does deal ultimately, ultimately.
[time=2881] And please don't say, aha, I heard so and so was sick, why he must have sinned and God defiling him back.
[time=2889] No, no, for what sin did Job suffer? Name it. What sin caused Job to suffer? It was the absence of sin in his life.
[time=2898] It was the fact that he was walking with God that the adversary attacked him.
[time=2903] Don't ever apply this to anybody except for one person. There's only one person you can use this on, that's you.
[time=2911] I'll use it on me, you use it on you and let us all be warned that if we sin, it defiles the body.
[time=2921] Do you remember the story of Aiken in the Bible? God allowed them a great victory over Jericho and he said, don't take a thing.
[time=2928] And Aiken took something and hid it in his tent. The next week when they marched out against the next city, the Israelites were defeated.
[time=2938] Why? God said because there's sin in the camp. And others suffered because of Aiken's sin.
[time=2945] Beloved, when you sin the rest of this body suffers. If you go to another church and you're walking in obedience, that church suffers.
[time=2956] The thing that bothers me the most when someone says, I'm not a Christian because I know another Christian and he's a hypocrite.
[time=2964] Nothing bothers me more than that. And I know that it gets to you as well.
[time=2970] Sin has a devastating defiling effect on the rest of the body.
[time=2975] And God deals harshly with it. As a matter of fact in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 30, it says they had taken a church carrying dinner that was followed by communion.
[time=2986] They took it into a big gluttonous bash. And Paul said for that reason, some of you are weak, some of you are sickly, and some of you have fallen asleep.
[time=2999] That meant death. That's what it means when God says, whose server will defile the temple? Him will I defile.
[time=3011] What defiles the temple? First thing is sin. The second thing that defiles the temple of God is humanistic thinking.
[time=3022] For the last two and a half chapters, we've been looking at the contrast between humanistic thinking and heavenly thinking.
[time=3030] Verse 18 says, let no man deceive himself. Don't fool yourself. If any man seameth among you to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
[time=3044] Notice it says here, if any man seameth to be wise. Here again we're seeing this sharp contrast between God's wisdom and man's wisdom.
[time=3055] And the two are completely different. Completely different. Now he says, if someone seems to be wise among you, what does it mean seeing?
[time=3066] I think it means if someone appears to be wise, they're wise in this world. They better get God's wisdom to go along with it.
[time=3075] If there's anything that this generation of evangelical Christians that has done, it has violated what this passage is saying.
[time=3083] We've taken those who are seemingly wise in this world and said, "Ah, they're Christian leaders." Although they've never gained the wisdom of God.
[time=3092] So because someone is a great musician or someone is a television personality or someone is a great athlete or a successful businessman and they come to Christ.
[time=3102] We say, "He can throw a football. Surely he knows theology. We'll put him up as the spokesman for Christianity."
[time=3109] And here's some guy who plays quarterback for some third-rate team and he's now the spokesman on creationism.
[time=3116] When his IQ leads you to think he may be the product of evolution.
[time=3123] I think it's exciting when a musician or an athlete or a businessman comes to Christ, but just because they have skill in this world doesn't mean that they have wisdom that is from above.
[time=3134] And here's what he says, "If anybody thinks they're wise, then let them become a fool."
[time=3141] Why would we say become a fool? Well, he explains that in the next phrase, "For the wisdom of God is foolishness to this world."
[time=3151] What we deem as wisdom with insight that comes from the Word of God, the secularist will say, "That's foolish."
[time=3160] A young man at Wheaton College had been led by the Spirit of God to give his heart not only to Christ as Savior, but to serve him as a missionary.
[time=3169] And he desired to serve him with the Acha Indians. And they said, "Jimile, you're a fool."
[time=3176] Those Acha Indians kill. They're cannibals. They're violent. Jim, you're a fool.
[time=3184] Jimile had said, "He is no fool who gives up that which he cannot keep to gain that which he can never lose."
[time=3194] A young man was one of the greatest high school football players to come out of his hometown.
[time=3201] He had college scholarships offered him from just about every college that a young man could ever dream of playing football at.
[time=3209] He paid his own way to a small Christian college, and they said, "You're a fool, David. You're a fool."
[time=3218] Playing football in a small, obscure Christian college, he commanded the attention of the world.
[time=3225] He was an early round draft pick in the NFL. He could have rode his own ticket, and he did. He became a pastor.
[time=3234] And they said, "You're a fool. You can play football for five or ten years, and then be a pastor."
[time=3241] He said, "No, I'll serve him now." And they said, "You're a fool. I'm thankful that he was a fool because he became the pastor that led me to Christ."
[time=3251] I'm glad he was a fool.
[time=3254] You know, it doesn't seem right to this world to make decisions. They say those decisions are foolish.
[time=3261] God says, "No, they're born in a wisdom that this world will never know." And if you really want to become wise, become a fool, nothing will pollute the church more than human wisdom taking over where spiritual wisdom ought to be in charge.
[time=3282] Are you willing to become a fool for Christ?
[time=3287] Some of you are living with spouses who don't deserve your love, but you realize you don't deserve Christ's love.
[time=3295] And so you're loving them through Christ.
[time=3297] And somebody in your office says, "You're a fool. You ought to leave that jerk." And you're saying, and you're hanging in there, and you're loving the unlovely, and that's wisdom that's from above.
[time=3308] But they'll call you a fool.
[time=3310] Some of you are in a business where it pays better if you don't pay attention.
[time=3316] You know, if you just look the other way and you let it slide, there's more money to be had by everybody, but you can't.
[time=3322] They say, "Man, you're a fool!" "Ah, you are by this world's standards, but by God you're wise."
[time=3332] And if you allow your life and the life of this body to be governed by humanistic wisdom, we will be defiled.
[time=3340] Our reference point has always got to be the word.
[time=3345] And then there's a third thing that defiles the church, its division.
[time=3349] That's been a constant theme.
[time=3351] How many times in the last weeks have we heard the names Paul, Paulus, and Cephas?
[time=3356] Here they appear again in verse 21.
[time=3358] "Therefore let nobody, glory and men, let's not get hung up on personalities.
[time=3363] Let's not say Paul or Paulus or Cephas."
[time=3369] You know, churches are split and they're divided over little things.
[time=3374] There are those that say, "I'm of the youth group." "Well, I'm of the Christian school." "Well, I'm for missions." "Well, I'm for discipleship." You know what he says here, whether it's Paul or Paulus?
[time=3384] "They all belong to you." Everything belongs to you.
[time=3388] You like Bill Gothard?
[time=3389] Great!
[time=3390] Learn from Bill Gothard.
[time=3391] God's giving them to the whole body.
[time=3392] He's giving them to you.
[time=3393] You like Chuck Swinsall?
[time=3395] Swind all that's great.
[time=3396] Listen to him every day on the radio.
[time=3399] But let's not say, "I'm of this school." And I don't accept, I know there's a place for doctrine, but beloved you, let's not split theological hairs either.
[time=3411] Here he's saying, "It's all here for us.
[time=3414] All of it is.
[time=3416] Let's not divide over little issues, style of music, heraldings.
[time=3422] Not only is it all given to us, but it all belongs to Christ.
[time=3426] Do you belong to Him?
[time=3428] Are you as temple?
[time=3430] Are you His innermost sanctuary?
[time=3432] You can be today.
[time=3435] If you will open up your heart and receive Him, I pray that you will."
[time=3455] You've been listening to our pastor, Rick Hawks.

[time=3486] I ask You to do that right now.
