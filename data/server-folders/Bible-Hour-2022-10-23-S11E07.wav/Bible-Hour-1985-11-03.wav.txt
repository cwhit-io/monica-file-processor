[time=0] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=10] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=14] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=21] With inspiration of music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word who's to recall.
[time=31] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=34] [MUSIC]
[time=38] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=42] It is a joy on this Sunday morning to welcome you to our Morning Worship Service.
[time=48] We've come today to assemble together as believers in Christ to exalt the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[time=55] We pray today that you know Him personally, and today might be a day of growth in your life as a believer in Christ.
[time=63] And if it could be this morning that you've never received Christ as Savior, we particularly welcome you and invite you to study the scriptures, to sing with us and to investigate together the claims of Jesus Christ, that He is indeed both Savior and Lord.
[time=79] We welcome our friends today who are here and also those who gave us the privilege of joining them in their homes or perhaps hospital rooms through the Bible Hour.
[time=89] We've come today to announce that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and to trust Him is a privilege.
[time=95] Oh, it is sweet to trust the name of Jesus.
[time=98] Listen, as our choir ministers to us in song, singing, "Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus." [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, how might I trust Him? [MUSIC] How I proved Him more and more [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus [MUSIC] Of our grace to trust Him more [MUSIC] O, now sweet to trust in Jesus [MUSIC] Just to trust His went in love [MUSIC] Just in simple way to blunge me [MUSIC] Be thou healing went in love [MUSIC] I'm so glad I learned to trust me [MUSIC] Precious Jesus, Savior, friend [MUSIC] And I know that thou art with me [MUSIC] Will be with me to the end [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, how might I trust Him? [MUSIC] How I proved Him more and more [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus [MUSIC] O, for grace [MUSIC] O, for grace to trust Him more [MUSIC] Let me trust you [MUSIC] Let me trust you [MUSIC] Trust you more [MUSIC]
[time=372] He promised us that he would be a counselor.
[time=380] The mighty God and the prince of peace.
[time=388] He promised us that he would be a father,
[time=394] and he would love us with a love that would not cease.
[time=401] Well, I tried him, and I found his promises are true.
[time=409] He's everything he said he would be.
[time=417] The finest words I know could not begin to tell,
[time=424] just what Jesus really means to me.
[time=434] And he's more wonderful than my mind can conceive.
[time=444] He's more than wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=451] He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams.
[time=464] He's everything that my soul have longed for.
[time=473] Everything he promised so much more.
[time=478] He's more than amazing, more than marvelous,
[time=485] more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=492] He's more than wonderful.
[time=496] That's what Jesus is to me.
[time=504] â™ª
[time=517] I stand amazed when I think that the king of glory
[time=524] would come to live within the heart of man.
[time=531] Oh, I marvel just to know he really loves me
[time=538] when I think of who he is, who I am.
[time=548] And he's more wonderful than my mind can conceive.
[time=558] He's more than wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=565] He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams.
[time=578] He's everything that my soul had longed for.
[time=587] Everything he promised so much more is more than amazing,
[time=595] more than wonderful, more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=605] He's more than wonderful.
[time=609] That's what Jesus is to me.
[time=619] He's everything, everything that my soul had longed for.
[time=628] Everything he promised so much more is more than amazing,
[time=636] more than marvelous, more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=646] He's more than wonderful.
[time=653] That's what Jesus is to me.
[time=667] He's everything to me.
[time=680] [APPLAUSE]
[time=694] Thank you and praise the Lord.
[time=698] One of the greatest privileges that is ours as believers is the privilege of prayer.
[time=704] We don't pray necessarily like people and other religions.
[time=715] In fact, Jesus told us not to pray like those who do not really know the Lord pray.
[time=723] For they think that they can impress God with their much speaking or by punishing themselves or with elaborate words and phrases.
[time=728] Jesus said, "No, no, my followers, talk to your Heavenly Father as your loving Father,
[time=737] commune with Him simply out of the depths of your heart.
[time=742] Pray after this manner.
[time=746] [MUSIC]
[time=752] Our Father,
[time=762] which art in heaven
[time=772] I'll wait be
[time=781] Thy name
[time=791] Thy kingdom come
[time=799] Thy will be done
[time=805] in earth
[time=820] [MUSIC]
[time=837] Give us this day our day pray and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[time=859] [MUSIC]
[time=868] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=881] For time is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[time=911] [MUSIC]
[time=930] We've been enjoying the ministry of Paul Schumacher here together today and I know that you have appreciated that and we're going to go back to hearing Paul sing in just a few moments.
[time=940] But right now Pete and I wanted to share some special events coming up with you in the life of our community and our church.
[time=947] And next is another musical event, Stephen Maria.
[time=951] Yes, yesterday in the newspaper we had an ad about Paul Schumacher and an ad about the living Christmas tree and an ad about the concert concerning Stephen Maria Gardner.
[time=960] Stephen Maria Gardner are going to be with us next Saturday night, November 9th.
[time=964] They're going to premiere their new record entitled The Best Love Song. We always have a good time when they come to minister to us.
[time=971] They're going to have the entire evening. It'll be all music. We want you to invite your friends and by all means come next Saturday night, November 9th, and the concert begins at 7 p.m.
[time=981] Pete, I'm looking forward to that and I apologize to you friends in South Bend and Marion that as you're hearing all this, we're well past November 9th.
[time=990] Hopefully we've shared it enough with you in advance that you knew about it and were able to join us.
[time=995] But for you friends here in Fort Wayne, we do want to encourage you to come and enjoy the ministry of Stephen Maria this Saturday.
[time=1001] And again Pete, the time is 7 p.m. 7 p.m. We hope that you'll be able to join us.
[time=1007] Today I want to share a booklet with you that I have enjoyed and been helped as I have read it.
[time=1012] It simply has a one-word title, Acceptance.
[time=1016] Pete, we were with some friends the other night and they said they encouraged their high school senior to invite a certain girl out and he said no thanks mom, I'm not into rejection.
[time=1025] You know, whether we're a high school senior looking for a date or whether we're a businessman knocking on doors to sell product, Acceptance is one of the chief emotional needs that each of us has.
[time=1037] None of us like to be rejected or to feel unwanted.
[time=1040] This booklet by Walt Hendrickson talks about the acceptance that you and I can know inside us because God accepts us.
[time=1049] That helps us to accept ourselves and then we find ourselves being more acceptable to others.
[time=1055] We want to send you this helpful little booklet. I'm sure it would be of great value to each of you.
[time=1060] You may be a housewife, you may be a businessman in the Salesforce, you may be a student.
[time=1065] No matter who you are, one of our most basic interpersonal needs is for Acceptance.
[time=1072] If you'd like a copy of this booklet, we would like to send it to you free.
[time=1076] Simply write to us today at the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=1087] Again, our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1098] Well, Pete, it seems like it's just the beginning of November, but already we are fast moving with the living Christmas tree and tickets become available very soon.
[time=1107] Yes, the Founders' cup letters have been sent out and the members will receive their envelopes to choose the night that they want to go to the concert and then our public distribution of tickets, thousands of tickets will be given away on Saturday, November 16.
[time=1122] That's when we encourage our viewers of the Bible Hour to come in person.
[time=1126] You can pick up as many as eight tickets.
[time=1128] Every person that comes to the Convocation Center on Saturday, November 16 can receive as many as eight tickets for the concerts.
[time=1136] Pete, you know we're looking forward to that.
[time=1138] It seems like a tremendous amount of work, 15 concerts, but there really a lot of joy that goes with that.
[time=1145] We have 14 public concerts and one premier concert that is a benefit for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1151] If you'd like information about the benefit concert, please call us here at Black Hawk at 749-8524.
[time=1159] And then for the public tickets for all the other 14 concerts, they become available on November the 16th.
[time=1166] Our dates for that beginning, if someone has a pencil, you can quickly jot it down, is December 13th, December 14th.
[time=1175] There are three concerts and then on December 15th, there are two concerts on that Sunday at 5 o'clock and 8 o'clock.
[time=1182] And then on December 18th, 19th and 20th, there are concerts and then three concerts on the 21st, and then we finish off December 22nd.
[time=1191] That's a Sunday with two concerts.
[time=1193] What are you going to do December 23rd, Pete?
[time=1195] Probably collapse.
[time=1196] I bet you will.
[time=1197] Well, we're looking forward to that opportunity to share with this northeastern Indiana area and our friends who drive in the joy of knowing Christ at Christmas.
[time=1207] Thank you for joining us today, and now we're going to go back and hear the ministry of Paul once again.
[time=1237] We'll risk their reputations that men may know their name, but just to know that all is clear between my soul and God's dear son, and hear him say, well done.
[time=1261] Now that's worth everything.
[time=1266] And just to know that the future is here forever.
[time=1277] And just to feel the freedom of a child.
[time=1287] And just to know that the past is gone and sunshine's here to stay.
[time=1299] And he is Lord of all.
[time=1303] That's worth everything.
[time=1309] To know when tiny feet walk in the path that I have left behind.
[time=1320] That they will make their way to Jesus.
[time=1326] Contentment there to find just to know down deep within my heart that I have wrong no man.
[time=1340] And fit my master's plan, oh that's worth everything.
[time=1349] And just to know that the future is here forever.
[time=1359] And just to feel the freedom of a child.
[time=1369] And just to know that the past is gone, sunshine's here to stay.
[time=1380] And he is Lord of all.
[time=1385] Yes he is Lord of all, I know he is Lord of all, and that's worth everything.
[time=1407] To know the future is his.
[time=1410] To know that you're in his hand that you're fulfilling his will of your life.
[time=1416] That's worth everything.
[time=1418] I hope you know that today.
[time=1420] Some of you perhaps are curious to know about my illness.
[time=1426] You've heard about it and often there are false rumors that go around.
[time=1430] I have a rather rare disease called carcinoid syndrome.
[time=1434] It's a type of cancer and this August 5th had my second operation in the last two and a half years concerning this disease.
[time=1445] I had several tumors removed from my liver, rare disease, rather rare operation.
[time=1451] I want you to know that in the midst of this crisis that my Heavenly Father has been as faithful to me as he has promised to be.
[time=1463] In his word.
[time=1466] I want you to know today that when you pass through the valley of the shadow of death,
[time=1473] when you face crisis and difficulty and unexpected sorrow and challenge in your life, if you're a Christian,
[time=1486] if you love the Lord, I want you to know that he is going to be faithful to you in the midst of that crisis.
[time=1500] The Lord is with us always.
[time=1502] He never leaves us nor forsakes us.
[time=1504] He is with us on the mountaintop.
[time=1506] He is with us in the valley and he is with us all the times in between.
[time=1513] It's inappropriate to challenge God.
[time=1518] It's wrong to do battle with him when difficulties come into our lives.
[time=1524] Don't we know that he has promised that all things work together for good to those that love the Lord
[time=1534] and are the called according to his purpose? Well, if that's true, then why should we become bitter?
[time=1543] Why should we say, "God, you're not being fair with me?"
[time=1551] All things work together for good.
[time=1556] Our God is a sovereign God.
[time=1561] Because he is sovereign, he has the right, the authority to do anything he wants to do.
[time=1570] Any time he wants to do it, however he wants to do it, to whomever he wants to do it.
[time=1579] Our God is a great God and he treats his children with love.
[time=1584] One day very soon, we are going to be with him.
[time=1589] Life is short.
[time=1592] It doesn't last very long.
[time=1594] One of the lessons that I have learned through my illness, one of many wonderful lessons he has taught me,
[time=1602] the precariousness of life, the soonness of his coming, the immediacy of being with him forever and ever.
[time=1632] [MUSIC]
[time=1654] The sky will unfold, preparing his entrance.
[time=1674] The stars will applaud him, with thunders of praise.
[time=1692] The sweet light in his eyes will enhance those away team.
[time=1710] And we shall behold him, then face to flame.
[time=1727] And we shall behold him, we shall behold him, face to face in all of his glory.
[time=1782] Our Savior and Lord, the angel shall side.
[time=1800] The shout of His power is the sleeping will rise from their smandering place.
[time=1826] And those who remain will be changed in a moment.
[time=1843] And we shall behold him, then face to face.
[time=1860] We shall behold him,
[time=1870] we shall behold him, face to face in all of his glory.
[time=1889] And we shall behold him, we shall behold him, face to face.
[time=1914] Our Savior and Lord, we shall behold him.
[time=1928] We shall behold him, our Savior.
[time=1950] Thank you, Paul. Our God and our Father, we are thankful for a song that with power and energy
[time=1971] reminds us that Jesus Christ is coming again and that we will behold him, our Savior and
[time=1980] our Lord. Father, thank you for music that puts a new perspective in our minds. Thank
[time=1987] you for the encouragement that came to souls today as a song would be heard. Thank you
[time=1994] that you planted a vision in the heart of those who have been rejected, those whose spouses
[time=2001] have been unfaithful, whose children have been rebellious. God, a song today has reminded
[time=2007] us that there is one who is faithful, the Lord Jesus Christ, and we long for the day that He comes. Thank you for the encouragement and the perspective of hope that a ministry
[time=2019] of music can place within us as we face the gripping pains of life. We think particularly
[time=2027] of those today who have lost loved ones, for Warren Cartmill and Nancy Jackson and their
[time=2033] sons and their family, for Joyce Schindler and Russellian as family, for those who have
[time=2041] tragically lost children in recent months and years. God, we would faint within ourselves
[time=2050] if there was not hope and our hope is in Jesus Christ and we long for the day that He comes.
[time=2057] Father, forgive us for today living too much like citizens of this kingdom and not of
[time=2066] your kingdom. Thank you for a reminder and a song. We pray that you would use music,
[time=2075] your word, and your people to comfort those who fight a long battle, for Paul himself
[time=2082] as he battles cancer and for Mary. Pray for Ralph Kramer, Martha Eastland, Judy Nussbaum.
[time=2090] We pray particularly for Jenna Clark and her mother and her long convalescence that you
[time=2096] would encourage each of these hearts today. Through your word, you would strengthen them.
[time=2104] Father today, we find in you a refuge and a reason to live. Put within our hearts a confidence
[time=2111] to serve you. Give to us a perspective not only of your son and who he is, but ourselves
[time=2118] that we might be humble before him. For it is in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2126] I want to invite you to open your Bibles with us this morning for our time of study of the scriptures. We're studying in 1 Corinthians and today we begin the 4th chapter, 1 Corinthians
[time=2138] chapter 4. Today we'll study verses 1 through 7. Today I am going to give a title to a message.
[time=2146] I don't often do that, but allow me that privilege today if you would. I'd like to title this message, "No Superstars." You know, we as Americans love heroes, and there's a place
[time=2158] for heroes. The Bible says that we are to be examples one to another, that we're to model,
[time=2164] we're to represent Christ. But even that good encouragement can be taken too far. No heroes.
[time=2173] No holy heroes and no superstars. We love superstars, don't we? We turn on the television
[time=2179] set and we're surrounded by athletic superstars, a George Brett who can swing a baseball bat
[time=2185] and lead a team to a world series. He's a superstar. A Dan Marino who and his youth can
[time=2191] throw a football and surpass all other records of time. He's a superstar. National powers
[time=2198] like Ohio State University, a superstar and the Big Ten. We like heroes, don't we? We
[time=2205] like superstars. Even in sports we have the super brat of tennis. We exalt someone because
[time=2212] of their unusual ability. Music is the same. There are those who we hold up on a pedestal
[time=2219] and we say they are super. And then amongst the athletes we bring them all together for a battle of the superstars. Even my son who is two years old, two years old is enamored
[time=2231] with the super heroes on cartoons. Yesterday he attacked me and struck me on the leg and
[time=2237] said thunder. Holding his mother's pink feather duster. Not quite looking the part of a hero.
[time=2248] We even often carry that beyond the sports, beyond the music, beyond the cartoons and
[time=2256] start thinking of Christians. This one or that one. This ladies ministry of music, this guy's ability to communicate. We start thinking of super heroes among Christians. It's always
[time=2272] a dangerous thing to do. To elevate one person, man or woman, among the believers and say
[time=2279] this one's super. This one is above the rest. It can lead to a number of problems. It can
[time=2288] lead to something as graphically tragic as Jonestown where a group of people say this
[time=2294] man is above all others and we will trust him unreservedly and they did and they died. It
[time=2305] may be more subtle that a group of people look at someone who's been a Christian longer
[time=2311] than they have and they seem so successful in the business world and so able to quote the right verses at the right time and they say he's a super Christian. And then they
[time=2321] discover that his feeder of clay in his heart of flesh and he fails them and they have failed
[time=2328] to make the only reference point Christ. No superstars. 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verses
[time=2336] 1 through 7. Paul writes about superstars. Obviously the context means he's speaking
[time=2343] more of himself and the Paulists but the text also makes it clear he's speaking about each of us. Let a man sow account of us as of the ministers of Christ and steward of the mysteries
[time=2357] of God. Moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it
[time=2366] is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of any man's judgment. Yay. I judge
[time=2376] not my own self but this for I know nothing against myself yet I am not hereby justified
[time=2390] but he that judgeeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord
[time=2398] come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the
[time=2405] councils of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of God. And these things brother
[time=2414] and I have in a figure transferred to myself and to a Paulist for your sakes that ye might
[time=2421] learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed
[time=2429] up one against another for who hath made thee to differ from another and what hast thou
[time=2438] that thou did not receive? Now if thou didst receive it why does thou glory as if thou
[time=2447] hadest not received it? No superstars. The tendency in the early church was to look at
[time=2454] the apostle Paul who was certainly unique in his gifts and unique in his accomplishment
[time=2460] and to say he's a superstar and a whole another group of people looked at a Paulist with his
[time=2468] eloquence his wisdom is training and his ability to communicate that and said wow a man for
[time=2475] our time a man for all times a Paulist he's the hero. Now Paul writes and encourages them
[time=2486] to avoid making of any person a hero. I believe he gives us three good principles here. Principle
[time=2495] number one is this is that we are to have a proper a proper regard for other believers.
[time=2506] Notice that he describes believers in two terminologies. First he refers to them as ministers and then secondly he refers to them as stewards. Let's look at them one at a time. When we hear the word minister we often picture an elevated position in our society being a minister
[time=2523] is still marginally credible as society views it. Often we hear the word minister used in
[time=2530] foreign affairs such as a foreign minister like an ambassador and so the word minister becomes somewhat elevated in our minds. This word for minister is the word that is translated
[time=2544] under rowers. What is a under rower? Well on a large ocean going ship in this day there
[time=2553] would be sales of course as it would primarily move by wind power but in those times when
[time=2559] the storm would not accommodate wind power or there would not be enough wind to blow the
[time=2565] ship there were galley slaves who were chained one to another and then to the bench on which
[time=2573] they sat chained to an ore that would protrude out of a slot in the side of a ship and they
[time=2580] would row the ship. In front of them on a raised platform or chair was a man who would
[time=2587] call out rhythmically row row row and these galley slaves would row the ship. It was one
[time=2597] of the lowest forms of slavery that a person could be impressed into an under rower. Paul
[time=2607] says we are gods under rowers. It's interesting that the two prepositions that we're comparing
[time=2617] are an absolute opposition super star someone who is above. God said I haven't called you
[time=2623] to be above everyone else. I've called you to be an under rower. That not only refers
[time=2632] to Paul 2,000 years ago are to me today who bears the title minister but to each of us
[time=2640] because the Bible says we are all witnesses for Christ, Acts 1 8. It says we are all ambassadors
[time=2647] for Christ, 2 Corinthians 5 20 and it says we are all called to be a peculiar people,
[time=2654] a holy nation, a priesthood. All of us were called as ministers. Not necessarily by occupation
[time=2666] but by function. It refers to us. We are gods under rowers. That's superstars under rowers.
[time=2676] Finally we are called stewards. The word steward comes from two words put together. One meaning
[time=2684] house, oikos and the second meaning manager. When you put it together you come up with a word that sounds very much like our English word economics. A manager of a house, a steward
[time=2696] was someone quite often a slave although not necessarily but usually such who was given
[time=2703] the responsibility to trust the oversight of someone else's house. The steward owned nothing
[time=2710] yet he was manager over at all. The clearest example of this that I can think of in the Bible
[time=2716] is the person of Joseph. Sold in the slavery by his brothers out of jealousy, moved from there
[time=2722] to prison and from pinnacle of the house of Potiphar. And if you'll recall when Potiphar's
[time=2730] wife tempted him, Joseph made a reply and I paraphrase, I can't do this. Your husband has given me
[time=2738] charge over everything in his house but you. As a steward, Joseph was in charge of everything
[time=2747] yet he owned nothing. The Bible here says that we are gods stewards. We are his managers. He has
[time=2755] given us charge over many, many things but we own nothing. It all belongs to him. As God's steward,
[time=2763] he's given us life. Yet this life doesn't belong to me. Yours doesn't belong to you. It belongs to
[time=2771] God. This body that I have, it doesn't belong to me. This is God's body. It is his temple. Your body
[time=2778] is his temple. It's not our own but he's given us management over it. God's given you a precious,
[time=2785] precious commodity called time. Yet time belongs to him and he has loaned it to you
[time=2791] to manage it and you're to be responsible. God's given us spiritual gifts. Everyone who is a believer
[time=2799] in Christ has been given at least one if not several spiritual gifts. God says I've given it to you
[time=2805] but it's mine but you can use it. You can manage it. God has given us talents by natural ability.
[time=2812] A Scott or a Dennis or a Paul can play keyboards. It's an amazing ability but God gave it.
[time=2820] Paul or someone else can sing. It's a gift that God's given that they're to manage.
[time=2826] God's given each of us financial resources in this land and abundance of it but it's not ours.
[time=2835] It's not my money. It's not my car. It's not my house. It's the banks. It's God's. It is God's
[time=2842] and as stewards there is accountability. For the last two weeks we have seen the judgment seat of
[time=2850] Christ in chapter three that we will have to give account for how we use that which God has made us stewards over. God's given you something. You're accountable to him. He says there are no
[time=2860] superstars. There are just underrowers and stewards. People who really don't own
[time=2867] anything. It simply belongs to God. So he says as you think about making a superstar of somebody
[time=2878] begin by having a proper regard for believers. Let's love one another. Let's respect one another.
[time=2886] Let's encourage and honor but let's have no holy heroes. Secondly he reasons from this angle.
[time=2896] That is that we must have a proper evaluation of believers. And so in verses three, four, and five
[time=2903] he gives to us a comparison between improper and proper evaluation. The improper he says are these two.
[time=2913] First it's the evaluation of popular opinion. Verse three. But with me it's a small thing. No big deal.
[time=2920] That I should be judged if you are of any man's judgment.
[time=2925] We have a tremendous tendency to evaluate somebody else's work for the Lord. To evaluate
[time=2932] somebody else's gifts. To evaluate somebody else's use of their spiritual gift. And to compare this
[time=2938] one to that one and this church is bigger than that church. Well this Sunday school is bigger than that one. Well this missionary is done more than that missionary. To be honest there has to be some
[time=2948] evaluation that goes on. But we as humans become hung up on man's opinion. Popularity. How public
[time=2962] sways and swells with this report or that testimony. Paul says it's no big deal. Paul said I don't
[time=2971] really care whether I'm as popular in Ephesus as a Paulus is. I'm really not concerned that I'm
[time=2977] personally held in high esteem by you and Corinth. It's no big deal. The judgments and opinions of
[time=2985] others. You know there's a dangerous thing. If we become overly conscious of what other people
[time=2992] think of us we will proportionately become less conscious of what God thinks of us.
[time=2999] There is a deep tragedy nestled in John chapter 12 when John records that many of the Jewish
[time=3008] leaders of Jesus day wanted to believe on him but feared men more than they feared God.
[time=3018] One of the great improper evaluations is popularity and how we're received by people.
[time=3028] A second improper evaluation is the evaluation of ourselves. We have a tremendous tendency to
[time=3038] think more highly of ourselves than we ought to. Even though we may have a clean conscience
[time=3045] we've really scrutinized ourselves with our limited perspective. We could miss something.
[time=3052] Paul says this verse four. Yay I judge not myself for I don't know anything against myself
[time=3060] yet I am not thereby justified. Paul said even though I feel clean what I think of myself isn't
[time=3068] nearly as important as the proper judgment which is this verse four. But he that judges me is the
[time=3079] Lord. The only proper evaluation that will come is not what public opinion says not what we think
[time=3087] about ourselves but what God thinks about us and his judgment as proper and Paul explains that in three ways. First of all he says God's judgment is at the proper time. Verse five. Therefore judge
[time=3101] nothing before the time until the Lord comes. Kids have a way of humbling us don't they.
[time=3108] To say that I am a carpenter or a woodworker is a gross misuse of terms. Wood butcher is a
[time=3116] little close to reality. But I like to go on the garage and the putter and the pound and the shape
[time=3123] and hope that it comes out. And I was building some bookshelves in the garage they were to soon
[time=3130] become the masterpiece of the dining or excuse me of the family room. Rachel came out and saw me
[time=3136] working and fussing over these boards and lining them up. She said what is that? I said well honey
[time=3142] that's a bookshelf. She said it is. I said give me some time. Let me get a little stain on it.
[time=3150] Fill in a few holes. She judged it before it was finished. Probably accurately in this case but
[time=3158] still before it was finished. We have a tremendous tendency to judge things now. What's happening now?
[time=3164] Did more people come to this Sunday school class? Did more people come here that speaker?
[time=3168] Did more people like this musician? Did that guy do a better job in evangelism?
[time=3172] How was that woman's speaker? And we judge, we judge, we judge. God says you're doing it wrong.
[time=3178] Your timing is off. Your timing is off. He says I will judge and I'll wait to the end of it all.
[time=3190] Jesus gave that in the parable of the wheat and the tears. He said don't go into the wheat field and say oh there's a tear and pull this one out. There's another one and pull that one out because the wheat and the tear, the grain and the weed looks so much alike that you will inadvertently
[time=3206] pull out some wheat thinking it's a tear and unconsciously leave some tears that you thought
[time=3212] were wheat. He said wait till the harvest time when they change colors. It'll be obvious.
[time=3218] Timing is so important. God says leave it to me. My timing is right. Don't build this person up as a
[time=3226] superstar. Let's see how they do on the last mile of the marathon. Don't put that one down.
[time=3232] Your timing is off. Secondly, God's judgment is proper because he not only does it at the proper
[time=3239] time but he does it over the proper issue. Notice the next phrase of verse five.
[time=3245] Who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the heart? God's going to judge two things that you and I don't. The first are the hidden
[time=3255] things of darkness. Those things which our heroes do that nobody knows in the secret moments of
[time=3261] their life when their humanity breaks through. God knows it and moreover God will judge the
[time=3269] secret things of the heart. That means the motives. God's not going to simply judge
[time=3275] performance and accomplishment. He is also going to judge this issue. It is the issue of motive.
[time=3282] Motive. It is completely possible for us to be doing exactly the right thing for exactly
[time=3291] the wrong reason. Paul mentioned that as he was singing and introducing the Lord's prayer.
[time=3297] Here were a group of people who were doing the right thing. They were praying. I mean, I haven't heard anybody say to praise wrong but they were doing the right thing for the wrong reason. They were praying and just quoting three or four chapters out of lamentations.
[time=3313] So everyone will say, "Man, that guy can pray." I didn't know there was a lamentations in the
[time=3322] Bible. That guy's got it memorized. Man, he must be special. You see, they were doing the right
[time=3328] thing praying for the wrong reason. Not to know God and to know as well but to impress the audience
[time=3334] that was around there. God says, "I know your motive. I know why you sing."
[time=3340] This one sings because they love me and I've given them a gift. That one sings because they
[time=3349] love the attention. I know why you preach because you want to declare God's word. I know why you
[time=3356] preach. You love to stand in front and have everybody's attention. I know why you share Christ
[time=3362] because you love people and want them to come to Him. I know why you share Christ. You can't wait to tell somebody else you've got another scalp hanging from your belt. God says, "I know your
[time=3373] motives and I'll judge those but motivate you." I hope it's did no Christ and the known personally
[time=3383] and the different is glory.
[time=3401] You've been listening to the music from our special guest Paul Schumacher and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

[time=3428] Christ to die on the cross for my sins and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart
