[time=580] He is able, he is able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=586] Let's sing that course, it's found on him number 744, 744 he's able, he's able, I know my Lord is able.
[time=609] He is able to carry me through, he's able, he's able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=632] He is the brokenhearted, he's set the captive free, he's able to walk again, and cause the light to see.
[time=647] He's able, he's able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=661] When you sing it once again with me, he's able, he's able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=681] He is able, he's able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=696] He is the brokenhearted, he's set the captive free, he's able to walk again, and cause the light to see.
[time=711] He's able, he's able, he's able, I know he's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=730] Thank you for your good singing. On Wednesday evening in our regular church activities, we have the chair of choir rehearsing, the sunshine choir rehearsing, all God's children rehearsing,
[time=741] the high school choir rehearsing, the second generation rehearsing, the sanctuary choir,
[time=747] many, many people involved in music. I'd like to introduce to you today the choir that's entitled
[time=753] "All God's Children," their director is Scott Schindler. They're going to be singing for us two choruses, a song that is entitled "In His Time," a song that talks about Jesus Christ making things
[time=765] beautiful in our lives as he so directs, and then finally they'll sing a song entitled "Lord
[time=771] Be Glorified." Let's listen to the ministry of "All God's Children" as they sing for us right now.
[time=788] [MUSIC - 54 seconds]
[time=856] God has a plan for your life, a special calling to do something for Him. To each one of us He has given talents and spiritual abilities to develop. Whatever God has called you to do, do the best
[time=867] you can with the love of Jesus' shine. Then when other people look at you, they'll see the Lord.
[time=873] That's what it means to glorify the Lord. God wants us to be glorified in our lives. He wants to use
[time=880] each one of us to show other people of His love. So if that sounds like what you want to do, you can start right now by letting this song be your prayer.
[time=915] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=962] Hearing from the children and the children's choir is always a special opportunity. Pete,
[time=970] I remember those days as a little boy being drugged to church much like Huck Finn and squeezed
[time=976] into one of those choir robes and not necessarily enjoying it, but I think our kids really do enjoy singing. I remember the day two that I sang in the soprano section and just about the time I got to enjoy it, they moved me. I bet you're one of the cutest sopranos I've ever seen. Well, last night
[time=993] we had a very special night here as we had our friends Stephen and Maria for a concert and
[time=999] we were just overwhelmed by their ministry and the great number of people that came to support and encouraged them. We had a lot of friends here that are friends of Stephen and Maria and I think it was a great encouragement to them and they had a good message for us and it was a stimulating evening for. It sure was, it was a time of great fun and it was also a time of great worship and
[time=1018] praise to the Lord, much like the living Christmas tree which isn't very far away. Several of the choir members were standing in the foyer and they were saying boy this just seems like the living Christmas tree and it was exciting to think about the fact that tickets are available and the next Saturday that is November 17th is the public distribution of tickets. If you would
[time=1038] like tickets for the living Christmas tree you can come to the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church from nine o'clock until five o'clock tickets will be available for you.
[time=1049] You have a limit of eight tickets per person but we would invite you to come at that particular time to assure the fact that you get tickets. Pete I know many people have asked me how they can get tickets and I want to take the same posture you do of saying please make every
[time=1065] effort of getting them this coming Saturday November the 16th as those tickets become available
[time=1071] because we can't promise anyone that will have tickets much beyond that because the demand is so great. So do stop by and pick up tickets next Saturday so that you can have an opportunity to
[time=1082] come and to join us in our celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ our Savior. One of the things
[time=1089] that we cannot ask or allow you to do and that is to write in for tickets and there's a very good reason for that when your letter comes in and you request tickets by the time we get that letter
[time=1100] often that particular concert is taken and so we have to write you back and say I'm sorry we don't have tickets what other concert would you like so you write back and by the time we get that letter that concert's gone by the time you write back it's January so that doesn't work does it.
[time=1114] Rick you might we might remind the people that there is an ad in Saturday's paper yesterday's paper
[time=1120] that gives all of the dates and I might remind them very quickly that our concerts begin on Thursday December 13th and they run December 14th I'm sorry that's Friday December 13th and then Saturday
[time=1133] December 14th and Sunday December 15th and then we have two days off and we begin Wednesday again
[time=1140] the 18th of December and then Thursday the 19th Friday the 20th three concerts on the 21st and
[time=1147] Sunday we conclude with two concerts December 22nd thank you Pete in addition to sharing the
[time=1153] living Christmas tree dates with you we have a helpful little book that we would love to send to you it has a simple one-word title acceptance having been a pastor and a youth pastor for more
[time=1164] years now than I would really like to bring up I have discovered that one of the greatest needs that people have at every age is to have a sense of acceptance acceptance first by God most important
[time=1178] secondly a sense of self acceptance and then finally a sense of being accepted by others it's
[time=1186] one of the great interpersonal needs that we have and this booklet addresses it in a very practical yet biblical way we'd like to send you a copy of it as a way of encouraging you in your spiritual
[time=1197] growth if you'd like a copy simply write to us and we'll send you one today again the title is
[time=1204] acceptance and if you just use that one word as you request it we'll get the right booklet to you our address is the Bible hour box 15 000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 once again the address is the
[time=1222] Bible hour box 15 000 Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 thank you again for joining us today as we go back to
[time=1234] our morning worship service Kerry Johnson's going to be singing I'm looking forward to that thank you
[time=1240] again and we hope that you'll stay with us
[time=1253] why did it have to be a friend who chose to betray the Lord and why did he use a kiss to show them
[time=1267] that's not what a kiss is for only a friend can betray a friend a stranger has nothing to gain
[time=1282] and only a friend comes close enough to ever cause so much pain
[time=1292] and why did it have to be a thorny crown pressed upon his head
[time=1312] it should have been a royal one made of jewels and gold instead
[time=1320] it had to be a crown of thorns flooring this life that we live for all who would choose to love a
[time=1335] thorn is all the world has to give
[time=1343] and why did it have to be a heavy cross he was made to bear
[time=1361] and why did they nail his feet and hands his love would have held him there
[time=1369] it was a cross for honor cross a thief was supposed to pay for Jesus had come into the world to steal
[time=1386] every heart away yes Jesus had come into the world to steal every heart away
[time=1408] thank you Kerry father why did it have to be a kiss why did it have to be a thorny crown
[time=1419] why did it have to be a cross father we understand that the answer to each of those questions is
[time=1433] my sin ours collectively and my own of course father made that song echo in our minds in the
[time=1444] coming days as a reminder that sin costs you your son may it be a reminder to us that as we
[time=1453] live in the face of temptation to not think it a small thing to yield and to know its cost and
[time=1462] therefore to stand and to flee father we would want to please you with our lives
[time=1471] and yet by our nature we are self-pleasing oh god today we would want to please you
[time=1478] we pray that we would be like your prophet who said your word was like a fire in our heart
[time=1485] god but within us a fire that consumes for god oh father today we've met in this hour to worship
[time=1495] you and to magnify your name and even as we meet this morning we sense our own unworthiness we would stand here with the stain of sin had not your son Jesus washed us and so we thank you
[time=1508] today that we know the power of washing and cleansing that we have been made new and so today father we
[time=1515] ask for your strength to live as new men and women fresh and different in a world that's trying to
[time=1522] squeeze us into its mold god may we stick out with a unique winsome testimony for Christ
[time=1530] father we pray today that your word would build in each life
[time=1536] we pray that those who don't know Christ would find him today in the pages of your word and in
[time=1542] the lives of your people we pray for believers today that you will not allow us to be apathetic
[time=1548] or indifferent but burning with fire and zeal for you we pray for the body that has been suffering
[time=1556] god that you would give strength and comfort we pray for Mrs Bennett and her senior years
[time=1563] and for her family as they walk with her through the dark valleys we pray for marviesland today
[time=1569] particularly god that you would give wisdom to doctors that they could treat his illness
[time=1575] that he might be restored to fullness of health to his family to his work and to his service for you
[time=1583] and god while he suffers we pray that you would be with him and that you would put in his heart
[time=1590] peace we pray for his wife Phyllis as she has made so many trips with her loved one to the hospital
[time=1597] that you somehow would encourage your heart god we would pray today for hazel humor as she faces
[time=1606] surgery we particularly pray for expectant mothers who face complications for Linda Pearson and
[time=1614] Cathy Milligan and Sherry Mirese god today we pray for Mary and for Ralph who are
[time=1621] homebound and suffering that you would be to them a companion in the comfort
[time=1627] father through your word today we pray that there would come a sense of strength to those who are
[time=1634] discouraged we pray particularly for teenagers and Tanya that she might make recovery with her own
[time=1642] spirit that she might be home soon father today we pray that our teens would learn the high cost
[time=1650] of disobedience and learn to follow you in their youth father we pray for men that you would guard
[time=1658] eyes that are prone to lust and women who today would see a different goal than that which you
[time=1666] have granted them god as we face temptation we pray that you would deliver us most of all god today
[time=1673] I pray that you'll deliver us from complacency for it's in Jesus name that we pray amen
[time=1680] I prayed this morning for deliverance from complacency because of all of the things that could grip
[time=1691] this church and that it could grip me complacency may be our greatest enemy
[time=1699] I'm sure you've heard the old story I love it and love to tell it again and again of the man who went door to door asking the question what's wrong with this great generation of ours is the greatest problem ignorance or is the greatest problem apathy the response was
[time=1718] I don't know and I don't care I don't care apathy indifference that point of life where we've got
[time=1730] enough that we basically say I'm full I don't need any more I'm rich I don't want any more
[time=1739] as Earl butts one said if it ain't broke don't fix it leave it alone I'm happy please it's my
[time=1749] boat don't rock it I'm full I'm rich I'm a king that's what the Corinthians said they were complacent
[time=1758] and Paul confronted them open your Bibles with me if you will the first Corinthians chapter four
[time=1766] and verses eight through 21 many of you had the privilege of being with us last night for the
[time=1774] concert that Steve Maria provided for us was a great time of worship and of fun one of the songs
[time=1781] that was a great deal of fun took us back to the fifties and there was the background music that remind us of that time was a lot of fun to sing and to hear that song but along with the fun of
[time=1793] the music there was a potent message Steve Gardner wrote the song and he introduced it by saying
[time=1799] I wrote this song after a conversation with a pastor friend this pastor was telling the joy of
[time=1807] some people in that church who had just come to Christ recently the pastor said it is great and
[time=1814] they're vibrant they're alive and they're sharing Christ it's tremendous I've just got to keep them away from the old Christians well there's a lot of truth to that that sometimes those of us who've
[time=1827] known Christ for five years 10 years 20 sometimes double that number we have become so content so
[time=1835] complacent so apathy that somebody who's excited about Christ looks kind of peculiar in our crowd
[time=1845] and it isn't long before that new excited Christian begins to say hey it looks like the rest of them
[time=1853] don't get that excited looks like the rest of momly talk about witnessing looks like the rest of momly
[time=1860] go praise the Lord very softly because we become complacent we've said ah it's good enough it's not
[time=1874] get excited first Corinthians chapter four and verse eight Paul says to the Corinthians
[time=1881] now any speaking saying their words back to them now ye are full now ye are rich
[time=1890] ye have rained as kings without us and I would to God ye did reign that we also might reign with you
[time=1905] for I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death
[time=1913] we have been made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men we are fools for Christ's sake
[time=1925] but you are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong
[time=1932] ye are honorable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst
[time=1943] and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labor working with our own hands
[time=1952] being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the
[time=1966] filth of the world and are the off scouring of all things unto this day I write not these things
[time=1977] to shame you but as my beloved sons I warn you for though you have ten thousand instructors in
[time=1986] Christ yet have ye not many fathers for in Jesus Christ I have begotten you through the gospel
[time=1996] wherefore I beseech ye be ye followers of me for this cause wherefore I beseech you be ye followers
[time=2009] of me for this cause I have sent unto you Timothy who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord
[time=2018] who shall bring you unto remembrance of all my ways which are in Jesus Christ as I teach
[time=2025] everywhere in every church now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you but I will
[time=2032] come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them were puffed up but the power
[time=2040] for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power what will ye shall I come into you with a rod
[time=2052] or in love and in the spirit of meekness here Paul is confronting the complacency of the Corinthians
[time=2064] here are a group of people that looked at their lives spiritually more or less took an audit held
[time=2071] in inventory and they said wow we're really doing great look at us why we've had Paul and
[time=2079] see us Nepales for last year's summer Bible conference we've heard all the great speakers
[time=2085] we have everything that we need we are full they spoke about being satisfied they didn't want
[time=2097] anymore they didn't want somebody else to stretch them they didn't want anybody else to demand of
[time=2103] them they didn't want anyone coming along challenging them they said we're full we've had enough it's great we've had enough thanks no more they said we're rich we've got all of these resources and
[time=2119] inventories and we've got the spiritual gifts here at Corinth why we've got this one who can prophesy and this one who has knowledge and all these people who can speak in tongues and we've got discernment and interpretation we're rich wow it's great to have all we have we're the super church
[time=2137] we're the first church of what's happening now don't miss it we've got it all then they said and we reign as kings they had reached a point of social acceptability
[time=2152] sophistication they had learned their way through the marketplace so that they as Christians were
[time=2158] now prominent and acceptable and they just felt like this must be the millennium this must be the
[time=2164] time when Christ reigns because we're certainly ruling right here it's great ain't it grand to be a Christian ain't it grand Paul said oh I wish that you did reign as kings because then I'd be reigning with you and I would
[time=2180] love it but the point of his satire is you're not reigning and you're not kings and you're not rich
[time=2192] and you're not full there's a very similar situation in the book of Revelation chapter three a different
[time=2200] church this time not Corinth but Laodicea that Jesus confronts with a passage many of you are
[time=2207] familiar with when he said I wish that you were either cold or hot but you're not you're in the
[time=2216] middle lukewarm not hot not cold Jesus said because you're lukewarm I will spew you out of my mouth
[time=2226] and then Jesus made this statement why because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods
[time=2240] and have need of nothing there was another group they took the inventory and they said wow we are
[time=2246] rich we have increased with everything that you could everyone to increase with we don't need a thing God said and know us not that thou art naked and miserable and poor and blind
[time=2263] we have a tremendous ability to reach a point of comfort and being comfortable with our spiritual
[time=2270] lives we're complacent and we say we don't need anything and God says you have great need but
[time=2276] you're spiritually blind and you don't see it you think you're rich and you're spiritually naked and
[time=2283] don't know it these are the people who when challenged to serve in greater ways they say
[time=2291] that's all right I've taught Sunday school I'll let somebody else have the opportunity now these are the people who heard the appeal that went out for people who would help with a project
[time=2302] and they say not really sure we need that project but thank you for trying these are the people who
[time=2309] heard it say we need to reach out and grow and share Christ and say I shared Christ last year
[time=2317] these are the people who heard it said we need to rise up and to build like from the day of Nehemiah who said I saw a couple empty rows in the overflow room these are the people who someone said we need
[time=2327] to reach out and to share Christ and be trained in evangelism who said I took that class in 75 who said I'm fine I'm comfortable I've had a little bit of all the different experiences
[time=2345] and I found my seat center section row eight first two chairs come early every week so nobody else
[time=2352] gets them and now in contrast to that mentality Paul speaks about the condition of the apostles
[time=2361] and the next verses roughly verses nine through 13 he speaks about these people who are comfortable
[time=2370] in complacent in contrast with the apostles let me give you four words to hang all of these
[time=2377] descriptions on first of all he said we're a spectacle verse nine I think God at the pointed us
[time=2383] sent us forth the apostles last as a spectacle with no doubt here he's speaking to what the Romans
[time=2393] called a triumph when a Roman general would take his army and they would attack the outpost
[time=2399] and make advances into the barbarians and would have a military conquest they would then return to Rome for a procession that they called a triumph they would parade before the emperor the senate in the scissors re of Rome first would come the general held as the
[time=2418] victor and the chief behind him his captains and then his legionnaires they would march to the
[time=2425] applause and the drumbeat of victory behind them they would bring the trophies anything that was
[time=2432] taken from that conquered land that was a sign of Roman domination perhaps it would be the royal
[time=2439] crown the jewels that represented that kingdom and they would be held high as a display and then there would become other booty and plunder that would take in livestock grain commodities
[time=2451] of the land and Rome would see that now they owned all this and then lastly in this triumph there
[time=2458] would come a group of people who would stop before the Roman emperor and his host and who would try
[time=2464] out these three Latin words tae moratori salutemus we who are about to die salute you last in this
[time=2475] procession would be captives who had been brought to Rome to be made a spectacle and they were going
[time=2481] to be taken into the Colosseum and there they would fight gladiators there they would fight
[time=2487] beasts and they would be torn apart and die and Paul says your kings and we're a spectacle
[time=2495] we've been brought up last we're dying and you're comfortable
[time=2505] did Paul exaggerate no he really didn't when he said that we are
[time=2513] a spectacle about the die that was exactly the situation years ago a man by the name of fox
[time=2521] dug into the pages of history and not all of this is factual some of it is no doubt
[time=2527] historical and some of it legend but in fox's book of martyrs he gives us this brief sketch
[time=2535] James was one of the first martyrs of the original apostles of those apostles and early evangelists
[time=2542] James was the first he was taken by Herod Agrippa in 44 BC held by trial that was a mockery taken
[time=2551] to the streets of Jerusalem and beheaded shortly after that Philip the evangelist was in prison
[time=2558] cruelly scourged and crucified in Asia Bartholomew met a similar death before Paul wrote this letter
[time=2567] to the Corinthians and all probability Matthew had died this time by the sword in the land that we now call turkey shortly after that probably in Egypt Mark had his feet tied together was
[time=2579] drugged by a rope you find a racing horse through the streets and left bruising bleeding his body
[time=2587] was thrown into prison overnight he died the next day they burned his body James the author of the
[time=2596] epistle that bears his name was beaten and then stoned to death in his hometown Matthias and
[time=2603] Andrew and Peter and the rest of the disciples and evangelist the list goes on Paul said you're
[time=2609] comfortable you're rich you're full we're a spectacle we're dying
[time=2618] then he said we're not only a spectacle but he said that we are social rejects
[time=2628] verse 10 he said we're fools you're wise he was again going back to that comparison
[time=2639] between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of man where man's wisdom would say don't speak up for
[time=2646] Christ if it's gonna cost you be socially acceptable where the basic navy blue three-piece suit and
[time=2654] play the part like the rest Paul you're foolish Paul you you just don't know when to be quiet
[time=2664] every time you go into town the only place you know to stay is a jail you're dumb Paul you're dumb
[time=2670] Paul said we've been made socially unacceptable because we follow wisdom from above that appears
[time=2679] foolishness to you he says you're strong all good for you Paul says we're weak we are beaten we are
[time=2686] bruised we are rejected we live in want but not you you're full you're rich
[time=2694] he said you're honorable you're mr. solencer i'm prisoner Paul
[time=2705] Paul says we have not only become a spectacle but we have become socially rejected then he says we're
[time=2713] sufferers in the next two or three verses listen to the list of things that he suffered and this is
[time=2719] only literally the tip of the iceberg he says we're hungry and thirsty he wasn't speaking of a diet
[time=2726] that he imposed upon himself he literally had gone without food and water often he says we're
[time=2734] naked actually it probably means in rags are underclothes for their elements perhaps naked
[time=2741] he said we're buffeted that means we're beat like a man abuses his slave we have no certain
[time=2748] dwelling place homeless could you imagine this morning the way it's raining outside and
[time=2756] the winter cold is beginning to ebb its way into our community if when the service was over in the
[time=2763] last light was turned out and you went out the door you had no place to go to that was Paul when he left quaranthe he had no certain place to go to no place to call home
[time=2779] then he says we labor working with our hands that's not bad no laboring with your hands is good
[time=2787] except for the fact that this phrase literally means to do the menial labor the labor that nobody else wants to do the jobs that stay undone because no one's willing to do
[time=2800] them i had the privilege of working at a christian camp for years and i loved every minute of it
[time=2807] and on those hot august days when it was about 95 and the humidity was the same
[time=2816] the flies were thick there was a race by the counselors to sign up for activities
[time=2823] because as an counselor you had to sign up to help out in some activity i always thought with my swimming background i should be at the pool the rest of the staff felt like that responsibility should be shared everybody hurried to get to the pool some volunteered to work with the
[time=2840] mini bikes but the last guy to show up undoubtedly found the only blank space the horse barn
[time=2847] nobody wanted to go squat flies in the horse barn particularly when at four o'clock you said
[time=2855] goodbye to the last camper and you manned the shovel it was the job nobody wanted to do
[time=2863] paul said you're kings and we're manding the shovel in order to get by we're doing the job
[time=2870] that nobody else wanted to do laboring with our hands that which everyone else says is unacceptable
[time=2876] he goes on then he says when we're reviled cursed at verbally abused he says we bless
[time=2884] we wish well when we're persecuted we take it we don't strike back we endure it
[time=2894] when we're defamed we encourage and then finally he says not only we're sufferers but
[time=2902] i like the word that the niv chooses we're the scum verse 13 we are made as the filth that's
[time=2910] probably human waste manure work treated like manure and we're the off scouring of the world
[time=2920] i'm not sure what off scouring was i discovered as i did a little further study that the word off scouring means that which is scoured off it doesn't sound real profound but let me explain
[time=2932] have you ever done a little cooking you cook like me you've had this second experience
[time=2939] after you done a little cooking there was more than a little cleanup that remained
[time=2945] being an impatient type if the directions say cook it at 204 one hour i figure you can cook
[time=2952] it at 400 for a half hour and save a little time as a result of that on the bottom of the pan there is this stuff that won't come off you take the pan you turn the spatula upside down you run
[time=2965] a little hot water in your scrub you keep adding in the detergent the hot water in your scrub by the time you're done you've got this slime in the sink paul says that's what we are we're the stuff that's been scraped off the pan scoured off
[time=2982] that's who we are he said but your kings i forgot your kings forgive me what paul was simply saying
[time=2995] to them is don't be so complacent don't be committed to your comfort at the cost of lost opportunities
[time=3005] paul said we're suffering and the reason why we're suffering is implication was is because we are
[time=3013] not complacent sitting around saying i've gone on a missionary journey that's enough i've started
[time=3019] three churches that's plenty i've shared christ with a dozen people why i can live off that for the
[time=3025] rest of my life every time they need someone to give a testimony for evangelism i'll be glad to
[time=3031] volunteer tell them about the time in nineteen aught that i shared christ paul said no we're
[time=3038] suffering because we're not complacent and now he begins to deal with them in a proper confrontation
[time=3049] he says i write these things not to shame you i'm glad he put that in there sometimes messages come from people like me and inflict people and afflict people like you
[time=3061] falsely using false guilt and just trying to embarrass people to put them down
[time=3067] few years ago we had a missions conference i normally like missions conferences this one
[time=3073] was an exception the man who came found it necessary to every time he spoke to regurgitate the same
[time=3082] statistics and with great flarry said that over ninety eight percent of the bathtubs in the world
[time=3088] are in the united states of america yeah great implication words we had too many bathtubs i didn't know whether to go to my house
[time=3099] that had to impry one loose and send it to india i did you know i didn't know what the point was but he said that three times once for each message which was always followed up by
[time=3109] ninety eight percent of all the televisions in america are in america around the world ninety
[time=3115] percent of them we have felt guilty and on and on and on the statistics went but there was never
[time=3123] any point what are you trying to do make me feel bad we saw film a man said that americans
[time=3132] spend more money on dog food than they do on missions i felt terrible and then he said but
[time=3139] i have a dog and went on with the message what's the point and there are times that people just say things to dig at us to make us feel guilty
[time=3153] paul said i'm not one of those i'm not just trying to make you feel guilty not trying to embarrass you or to put you down he said i simply trying to warn you that you're complacent and you better deal with it
[time=3168] you'd better deal with it and in these last verses he not only confronts them but i believe he gives
[time=3176] us an excellent model so not let's not just look at the content of the confrontation but
[time=3182] look at the model and learn from it the first thing that he does is he confronts them by building a bridge verse 15 he says though you have ten thousand instructors
[time=3197] in christ obviously he's exaggerating we call that hyperbolic he was speaking with a hyperbola they didn't have ten thousand but he says no matter how many instructors you have you don't have very many fathers do you paul said i have begotten you in christ but not i threw the
[time=3214] gospel no before we go out we confront somebody and we walk by them and say well i never which
[time=3222] usually should be followed by had a chance we tell people what they're doing that they shouldn't do
[time=3229] we need to earn the right to share those messages you need to build a bridge so paul graciously reminds them of a relationship that's between them like a father and a son or a mother and a son or daughter he said just remember that i loved you so much that i brought you into this world and
[time=3251] i nurtured you after you were born he builds that relationship
[time=3258] strong and sure and then secondly he graciously instructs them by example
[time=3264] verse 16 wherefore i beseech you be the followers of me
[time=3274] most important thing to do when confrontation is necessary is to make sure first of all that
[time=3281] we're an example of what we want it to be now when he said be a follower of me what did he
[time=3287] reference i believe he was referencing all the way back to chapter four verse one
[time=3293] when he says these words let a man account of us as two things first as a minister which we saw
[time=3301] last week actually meant a servant and under rower one of those galley slaves on the ship who
[time=3308] rode to the chanting beat of the master paul said be a rower be a server
[time=3317] and secondly said be like me be a steward don't say we're rich we're kings we've got it all
[time=3324] now he said remember that you don't have anything that hasn't been given to you god owns it all he owns it all and manage it with faithfulness paul not only warned them about being complacent
[time=3338] but he gave them an example an encouragement to follow that of not sitting on what they had but
[time=3345] using what they had with thankfulness and faithfulness thirdly he helped them achieve their goal
[time=3352] he said these words for this reason to help you do that i'm sending you timothy timothy my beloved
[time=3360] son faithful as he also in the lord and he's going to bring you into remembrance great experience
[time=3367] this last week knock in the door sue came in and said i know you're studying and i know you didn't want to be bothered but there's someone here to see you an in walk craig clapper craig worked with us here for a year he's now on the staff at bible town in boker atone florida just happened to be in the area he stopped by you know what we talked about for an hour
[time=3387] we talked about pastor david bernum the man who was my father in christ in craigs craigs working
[time=3395] with him now and you know what he did he put me in remembrance of how dave would handle things
[time=3401] because he was an example that i could follow and god so graciously sent a craig clapper to
[time=3408] encourage my heart to move towards those goals paul said i'm sending you timothy to encourage you
[time=3414] to help you achieve those goals god's put some people in your life follow their example and
[time=3420] their encouragement don't be complacent then finally paul does this he holds them personally
[time=3427] accountable he says i'm going to come you better be ready i'm going to come
[time=3433] some of you're saying oh paul paul says this paul says that but you wait i'm going to come i'm going to come he says when i come if you're ready then i'll be able to greet you with meekness
[time=3446] and with kindness but when i come if you're not ready i'll greet you with a rod or a whip
[time=3456] i don't think paul was sitting there thinking all those dirty krenthians and he got out three strands of leather and he started braiding them together and said this is one for paphroditis and this is one for this kind this is that wasn't paul's spirit but he was simply saying if the occasion calls for strength i can be strong but if you will repent and walk with effectiveness
[time=3477] instead of complacency i'll be able to greet you with love and a meekness jesus is coming
[time=3484] how will he find us how will he greet us if he comes today will he greet us with a rod
[time=3490] will he greet us with the words well done now good and faithful servant
