[time=121] - Morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=125] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=132] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=141] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=145] [MUSIC]
[time=154] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=159] It is a joy to welcome you this morning, not only those friends who are here in this auditorium, but our friends who join us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=167] As we have met in this place and have broadcast this service that we can declare that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and that God the Father is a great God.
[time=177] We hope today that you know Christ, and that you have come to worship Him.
[time=181] But if not, maybe today would be the day that you would open up your heart and receive Christ Jesus as Savior.
[time=188] Christ not only died on the cross for our sins, that our past sins can be forgiven, but today He's in heaven with God the Father, and He is ever interceding in our behalf.
[time=200] Listen now as our choir sings that great majestic song of knowing Christ as our Savior who intercedes for us today.
[time=209] He is ever interceding.
[time=212] [MUSIC] Come one who'll go the extra mile [MUSIC] Just like a mother carrying for a child [MUSIC] A friend who'll stick through with him then [MUSIC] No matter what you've done or where you've been [MUSIC] Just like one great big family will be [MUSIC] A stronger older brother he will be [MUSIC] So quick and proud he's to be fed [MUSIC] A younger weaker to be fed [MUSIC] And he's ever interceding in [MUSIC] To the Father for His children [MUSIC] He's each other interceding [MUSIC] To the Father for His home [MUSIC] To him you can reach the Father [MUSIC] So bring him by your family plan [MUSIC] Yes he's ever interceding [MUSIC] So come only to the Father [MUSIC] Just like cheap we go to spray [MUSIC] Struggling we need but that we could have paid [MUSIC] Not ever hoping to renew [MUSIC] The love and fellowship that we want to [MUSIC] But he began to intercede [MUSIC] Crying Father please forgive like me [MUSIC] And as the meals pissed in his head [MUSIC] I once again reached out to man [MUSIC] And he's ever intercede [MUSIC] To the Father for His children [MUSIC] Yes he's ever intercede [MUSIC] To the Father for His home [MUSIC] To him you can reach the Father [MUSIC] So bring him by your family plan [MUSIC] Yes he's ever intercede [MUSIC] So come only to the throne to his throne [MUSIC] Yes he's ever intercede [MUSIC] So come only to the throne [MUSIC] O, to be like the blessed Redeemer [MUSIC] Yes he's by God still going in prayer [MUSIC] Let me up for him, all the strangers [MUSIC] Jesus the perfect light was to pray [MUSIC] O, to be like me [MUSIC] O, to be like me [MUSIC] Blessed Redeemer [MUSIC] Here is the Lord [MUSIC] Coming thy sweetness [MUSIC] Coming thyfulness [MUSIC] Stand by the image [MUSIC] Keep on my heart [MUSIC] We are thankful from passion [MUSIC] Loving for giving [MUSIC] Tender and God [MUSIC] Coming our helpless [MUSIC] Tearing our faith in [MUSIC] Seeking our heart [MUSIC] Great spirit divine [MUSIC] O, to be like me [MUSIC] O, to be like me [MUSIC] Blessed Redeemer [MUSIC] Here is the Lord [MUSIC] Coming thy sweetness [MUSIC] Coming thyfulness [MUSIC] Stand by the image [MUSIC] Keep on my heart [MUSIC]
[time=662] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=800] Pete, that was interesting to hear a French horn and a fluegle horn.
[time=803] I don't know that I've heard that type of duet before.
[time=806] Both of them have a mellow tone, and usually you think of the fluegle horn as related to the trumpet, but the trumpet is much more brilliant, and the fluegle horn coupled with the mellow tone of the French horn really made a very nice blend.
[time=819] Well, that was something special for today. These are busy days for you with the living Christmas tree right around the corner.
[time=826] Yes, it was really a delight yesterday to have several hundred people in the Convocation Center waiting to get tickets, and I might say that several of the people that came to get tickets yesterday watched the Bible hour regularly,
[time=837] and we had a good time meeting some of you, and that was really great because it's an encouragement to know that when we're broadcasting the Bible hour, there are people listening and being blessed.
[time=847] You know, Pete, that's one of the things I enjoy a great deal about the living Christmas tree.
[time=852] Of course, the music and the holiday and the worship of Christ, but just as a little aside, we see hundreds,
[time=858] and perhaps that's an underestimate. Maybe it's even thousands of friends like you who join us for the Bible hour
[time=865] who come out for the living Christmas tree, and it's always a joy to see you and to meet many of you, and we're looking forward to that. We have had a very busy day yesterday, and three or four of the concerts, the tickets are gone completely. It's hard to believe that 1,300 tickets are gone, but they are.
[time=881] We have four concerts that are closed, but there are several concerts particularly written the second week that are available,
[time=887] and we might encourage our viewers to be aware that there are concert dates available on Friday the 13th.
[time=893] There are tickets. On Sunday, December 15th at 8 o'clock, there are tickets available on Wednesday the 18th at 8 o'clock,
[time=902] Thursday the 19th at 8, Friday the 20th at 8, Saturday at 2, 5 and 8, and then Sunday the 22nd at 5 o'clock and 8 p.m.
[time=915] The 21st and the 22nd, there are many tickets available, and I'd encourage you if you have the opportunity to come to the church office,
[time=925] those tickets will be available on a first-come, first-served basis next week. Thank you, Pete.
[time=930] I just need to ask you to help us in one way, and that is please do not write in for tickets.
[time=936] It almost becomes a comedy, or in some cases a tragedy, as people write in requesting tickets.
[time=942] By the time we get the envelope with their request, that concert is already taken, so we send them back a note saying,
[time=948] "I'm sorry, we don't have those tickets. What else would you like?" They send in their second choice. By the time we get that, they're all gone, and then there's some hurt feelings and people who feel left out.
[time=958] So please, if you'd like tickets, make the effort to come by and pick them up here Monday through Friday at the Black Hawk Baptist Church,
[time=965] and we'll be glad to get you those tickets.
[time=967] Also today, we'd like to encourage you to write to us for a little pamphlet that we want to share with you.
[time=973] It has the simple title, Acceptance.
[time=976] I don't know of a greater need that any of us have than to be accepted.
[time=982] I think there are three key areas of acceptance.
[time=985] First, there's the know that we are accepted by God.
[time=990] The Bible says that through our new birth and faith in Jesus Christ, we have been made acceptable in the beloved.
[time=998] God accepts you if you will accept His gift of eternal life.
[time=1003] Then there's a second key area of acceptance, and that is self-acceptance.
[time=1007] Once we realize that God accepts us, we should be accepting ourselves, even with our shortcomings, our heirs,
[time=1014] the fact that we don't like some things about ourselves, we learn to accept those and grow with them.
[time=1019] And then finally, we find acceptance from others.
[time=1022] We'd like to send you this pamphlet to help you grow in this key area of your life.
[time=1027] For a copy simply write to us, Pete, would you give our friends the address?
[time=1031] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1040] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1047] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1050] Bob Bonette is going to minister to us in music now as we return to our morning worship service.
[time=1056] In a world of air and turmoil, in a race that seems so hard to run,
[time=1085] O Lord, I need thy rich in filling.
[time=1094] Even so, O Jesus, come.
[time=1110] My heart, the flaunt for thee.
[time=1118] Though I fail and betray thy trust, even so, O Lord Jesus, come.
[time=1134] And when my eyes shall span the river, when I gaze into the vast unknown,
[time=1151] Lord, may I say with calm assurance, even now, O Lord Jesus, come.
[time=1168] Even now, O Jesus, come.
[time=1209] Thank you, Bob, that reminder and song that we look in long for the day when Jesus will come again.
[time=1230] Just before we look to the Lord in prayer, I've been given this note, and I need to ask Mrs. Hahn to go to the nursery, your little one needs you.
[time=1238] In two weeks when someone watches that in South Bend, I hope that they understand that this is a live broadcast of our morning service, and sometimes little ones need their moms.
[time=1248] Usually it's my son who needs his mom today, it's a different one.
[time=1251] We're delighted that you're here today.
[time=1254] I hope that your heart's open to studying the scriptures with us, but it's important before we do that, that we first look to the Lord in prayer.
[time=1261] So right now, that is our opportunity.
[time=1264] Would you bow with me in prayer, please?
[time=1267] [MUSIC] Sweet Arab prayer [MUSIC] Sweet Arab prayer [MUSIC] That calls me from a world of care [MUSIC] And bids me at my father's throne [MUSIC] Makes all my wants and wishes â™ª
[time=1327] Father, we come to you in this sweet moment today to open up our hearts before you.
[time=1335] Father, this sweet today to know that Jesus is our Savior, and like a shepherd leads us.
[time=1345] Father, it is even sweeter to know that today he is ever interceding, that the Lord Jesus is taking our feeble attempts to communicate our hearts and interceding for our shortcomings and holding us up before the throne of glory.
[time=1362] Father, we come today through the Lord Jesus to cast our care upon you as you have invited us to do in your word.
[time=1370] Father, today in particular, we pray for the body of Christ that is suffering.
[time=1375] We pray for those who live in a home where trust has been broken.
[time=1380] Unfaithfulness has scarred a family.
[time=1384] We pray for those today whose spouses are abusive, perhaps abusive of alcohol or drugs are abusive of their maid or children.
[time=1394] God, we pray today for those who live with unbelievers that they might be a gracious witness.
[time=1403] Father, today we pray for those single parents who wrestle alone with the struggles of life.
[time=1411] Father, we pray for a people halfway around the world whose homes and villages were destroyed by the eruption of the earth.
[time=1421] Father, today we pray for our nation.
[time=1424] You would give wisdom to our leaders, and we thank you for our president, our legislators.
[time=1431] Pray that you would give them guidance as they lead this nation.
[time=1435] We pray for our churches today, Father, that there would be revival across this land.
[time=1440] For revival of purity, both of doctrine and of conduct.
[time=1445] Father, today we pray for children who are suffering physically.
[time=1452] We pray for Justin that as he goes to the doctor for major surgery that you would give skill to that physician.
[time=1459] We pray for Allison that our little body might fully recover quickly.
[time=1465] Father, today we pray for those who face surgeries, those who have just recovered.
[time=1471] Think of Mrs. Lutz and Harry Bennett and Bill Civitz and Stan for Mary and Marv.
[time=1479] God, the number of people who are suffering physically goes on and on.
[time=1485] And so we pray that you, like a shepherd, will tend to each of your sheep.
[time=1491] Father, today through your word, we pray that you are shepherd will feed us.
[time=1496] God, I know that my words feed no one unless they beat your words.
[time=1501] So make the pages of the scriptures come alive in our hearts that we might know you,
[time=1508] that we might know your will.
[time=1510] For it is in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1516] This morning I invite you to open your Bible for a time of study with us to first Corinthians in the fifth chapter.
[time=1524] It's always important that we are studying with our Bibles open and our attention to the scriptures,
[time=1530] because what is important today is not what I say, but what God says.
[time=1535] And so we search the scriptures diligently to see if these things are true.
[time=1541] It's not a time when there's a need for more human opinion.
[time=1544] We're flooded with that. We have information pollution.
[time=1547] But we do need to know what God says.
[time=1550] And so we today have come together to study the scriptures.
[time=1553] If you have a Bible and you see a friend who doesn't have one, offer to share theirs or yours with them.
[time=1559] 1 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=1562] Paul writes, "It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
[time=1569] and such fornication as is not so much as named amongst the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife.
[time=1582] And you are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that have done this deed might be taken away from you,
[time=1593] for I barely, as absent in the body, but present in the Spirit, have judged already as though I were present concerning him that have done this deed.
[time=1608] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together and my Spirit with the power of the Lord Jesus,
[time=1617] to deliver such a one up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,
[time=1631] for your glory is not good. No, ye not that a little leaventh the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened.
[time=1654] For even Christ our Passover has sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven,
[time=1664] neither with the leaven of malice or wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[time=1674] I wrote unto you in an epistle not to keep company with forenicators, yet not all together with forenicators of this world,
[time=1684] or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters, for then must ye needs be go out of the world.
[time=1698] But now I have written unto you not to keep company if any man is called a brother,
[time=1706] a brother, and be a forenicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner.
[time=1715] Was such a one no not to eat? For what am I to do to judge them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?
[time=1727] But them that are without God judgeth, therefore put away from among yourselves the wicked person.
[time=1736] It's important today that we're studying the Scriptures as we come to this sensitive and powerful issue that we know what God says,
[time=1746] and not what this church or any other church says, and certainly not what this pastor or any other pastor says,
[time=1753] but what is it that the Scriptures teach?
[time=1757] There are parts of the Scripture that grip us because they speak so directly to where we live today.
[time=1767] This is certainly one of those passages. I wish I could say that this particular text ought to be put in mothballs
[time=1774] because it had relevance 2,000 years ago in Corinth, but it really doesn't fit today.
[time=1780] We can dismiss this one. We can't dismiss it. It is directed at us as much as them 2,000 years ago.
[time=1793] Two problems faced the Church of Corinth, at least these two in this passage.
[time=1798] The first was spelled out very clearly. It says there was fornication among you.
[time=1807] This passage makes it very clear as to the context.
[time=1811] It's always important before you begin to study and apply a particular passage that you know what the context says.
[time=1818] Don't go to a passage of the Bible and take a promise and say, "This one belongs to me if it was given to Israel 2,000 years ago,
[time=1826] and wasn't meant for you." Don't take a passage out of context.
[time=1834] The context of this passage is addressing immorality right here.
[time=1841] Not out there, right here, in the Church.
[time=1849] It is expected, not accepted, but it is expected that outside of the body of Christ that immorality would be common.
[time=1858] That doesn't make it more acceptable, but it is somewhat expected.
[time=1862] But what is neither expected or accepted is that in the body of Christ that immorality would take place.
[time=1870] The word is "pornia," from which we get the word "pornographic" or "pornography."
[time=1876] It's a generic term, if you will, to describe any type of immorality God classifies them all as the same as sin.
[time=1884] Whether there is premarital, extramarital, homosexual, or any other type of deviancy, it is immorality.
[time=1893] But the passage here goes on to describe the situation even further.
[time=1898] The most gripping of all the descriptive phrases is this one.
[time=1903] It is reported commonly among you.
[time=1909] Paul didn't write them and say, "Beloved, I must reveal to you that which you don't know."
[time=1915] I need to tell you something and it will shock you.
[time=1918] It will disappoint you. It will catch you off guard.
[time=1922] No, they knew it.
[time=1924] It was common knowledge within the Church.
[time=1927] It was commonly reported outside the Church. Everybody knew Paul as far as hundreds of miles away when he received Chloe's leather.
[time=1935] It already heard. It's common knowledge.
[time=1939] Fornication is a part of your Church.
[time=1943] Then he describes the type of fornication as someone living with his father's wife.
[time=1950] Now, it's not his mother. The phrase doesn't say mother. It's probably a stepmother.
[time=1955] And here is an individual who is now whether it is through marriage or through a living type situation, has entered into immorality.
[time=1964] Leviticus makes it very clear in chapter 18 verses 6 through 8 that this is absolutely detestable before God.
[time=1973] But that was common knowledge.
[time=1976] Paul says it's not only unacceptable to God but even the Gentiles who hold up immorality as a part of their religious services.
[time=1985] They even think that this is not even to be named.
[time=1989] Cicero, the Roman senator in his codification of laws, says that it was illegal in the Roman Empire for a man to take his stepmother.
[time=2002] The Romans were not known for their moral decency.
[time=2007] These were the people who brought human beings in to watch them eaten up by lions.
[time=2012] These are the people who brought people in and watched them have their sexual exploitation as a form of comedy.
[time=2019] And Paul says even these pagans, they don't even accept that.
[time=2026] And it's being commonly reported among you.
[time=2031] The first problem obviously was immorality. The second problem was equally as concerning if even not more so.
[time=2040] And that was this, verse 2.
[time=2043] And ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned.
[time=2050] The problem that comes secondly is that immorality was not only present, but it was being accepted with high approval.
[time=2059] Now how it is that this received approval is perhaps more speculative than factual.
[time=2066] But no doubt there were those who said freedom in Christ, freedom in Christ, the laws passed were under no law.
[time=2076] Freedom in Christ, we can do anything we want to do.
[time=2080] Perhaps there were those that sensed it was wrong, but sat down and folded their past little hands and said,
[time=2088] "Well I'm not going to judge anyone. Judge not lest ye be judged. Who am I to say anything?"
[time=2097] No doubt there were those who thought that this was just showing that the church was on the cutting edge.
[time=2104] You know you've got to meet society where it lives.
[time=2107] You can't have an us and them mentality. If that's how they're out in the streets, you just can't make any big deal.
[time=2113] You'll lose your audience. You get too narrow in your teaching and people aren't going to listen.
[time=2119] No doubt there were those that were really proud of what they had encountered in their church.
[time=2126] They called it the Church of Corinth, the first church of what's happening now.
[time=2131] And they found this to be a point of glorification.
[time=2135] The Bible says they were puffed up, we would say proud, but isn't puffed up a good word.
[time=2140] Here's this guy and he's just kind of walking, the shoulders are drooped over, the head's cast down,
[time=2146] and he's kind of shuffling along, but then someone recognizes and pays him a compliment.
[time=2151] Immediately the posture changes, shoulders go back, heads up, chin elevated, chest out.
[time=2158] That was Corinth's position. Someone said, "Hey, I've heard that there's some wild things happening at your church."
[time=2167] Yeah, as a matter of fact, there is.
[time=2172] Reminds me of a line out of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
[time=2175] In the opening scenes as the witches brood, she said, "Faire is foul and foul is fair."
[time=2182] It's become the wave of our society that that which is wrong is not all right.
[time=2188] And that which used to be all right is now wrong.
[time=2191] "Faire is foul and foul is fair." Turn on the television show and whatever happened to the Lone Ranger.
[time=2201] You know, the good guys wore white. They never killed anyone.
[time=2206] They shot guns out of people's hands from a quarter mile. Never missed.
[time=2213] Last week we turned on the television set late at night.
[time=2217] In five minutes we saw the good guys, the policemen chased somebody to a third world country,
[time=2223] bade him up and kill him and fly back home. He was the hero.
[time=2230] "Faire is foul and foul is fair."
[time=2236] There's a line in Disney's version of the Christmas Carol where Jacob Marley visits Scrooge McDuck.
[time=2246] And he's there to warn Scrooge that he's going to carry these chains through eternity if he doesn't straighten out his act. And Marley says to Ebenezer, "Lemending his condition,"
[time=2258] he says, "You remember that when I was alive that I cheated the widows and I swindled the orphans."
[time=2265] And McDuck says, "Jason, Jacob, all of them the same day!" Like wasn't that great?
[time=2276] Here is the Church of Corinth, and somebody says, "I understand there's somebody who's sleeping,
[time=2282] sexually involved with their stepmother." That's right!
[time=2286] They were puffed up. They were proud.
[time=2293] That's the situation, immorality and acceptance. Now Paul gives the solution.
[time=2301] Maybe not so much a solution because there's no guarantee that this will bring about a good end.
[time=2308] But it's a solution in that it's the proper way to deal with it.
[time=2311] Paul gives many statements, but at least these three commands that I'd like to draw together.
[time=2317] The first command, or step that we're to take, is de morn.
[time=2322] Verse 2, "You are puffed up and have not rather mourned." The word mourn says one grammatical historian is the word that used to describe the death of a close loved one.
[time=2335] It's a word that describes the worst possible thing that can happen in your life and the grief that you feel.
[time=2343] Paul says, "When this happened, there shouldn't have been pride, but there should have been a mourning."
[time=2349] The grief that gripped you and seemed unshakable.
[time=2356] I'm drawn back to eight years ago when, sitting with two friends, they were going through a time of deep grief.
[time=2367] A friend of theirs who was 40 years old died, a sudden, unexpected and timely death as it always is.
[time=2376] And another friend who was also about the same age, about 40, pastoring a church, they discovered on the same day,
[time=2386] had been sexually unfaithful and has now left his church, left his wife and is gone.
[time=2394] They were mourning both losses.
[time=2397] And the wife who I was sitting with said to her husband, "If I could choose today, I would rather be the wife of the man who died than to be the wife of the man who was unfaithful and left."
[time=2420] The immorality is to be grieved as is all sin.
[time=2427] Paul said, "You ought to mourn. You ought to mourn this." Then secondly, in verse 13, he says, "You ought to judge this sin."
[time=2440] What about those passages of the Bible, Rick, that say, "Judge not lest you be judged." Why wouldn't we be safer if we just took the ostrich approach?
[time=2452] You know, and just kind of acted like we didn't know it.
[time=2456] You know, you can always go in the other service and just avoid contact.
[time=2461] I mean, that's why we have two services, isn't it? So we don't have to sit with the people we don't like.
[time=2467] Now we'd need 50 services.
[time=2474] Well, what about 1 Corinthians chapter 4 where Paul says they're not supposed to be judging each other?
[time=2481] Well, I think there's a little difference.
[time=2484] You see, the judging we're not supposed to do is I'm not supposed to judge your motive.
[time=2489] I'm not supposed to judge you and say, "Yeah, I know you went and visited that friend in the hospital, but the only reason why you did is you felt guilty." Well, I know that you labored around the church, but the only reason why you did that is so somebody would notice.
[time=2502] "Yeah, I know you share your faith, but you're just trying to file another notch on your spiritual revolver."
[time=2509] Got another one for Jesus.
[time=2512] Not my job to judge your motive or yours to judge mine.
[time=2517] Nor are we to judge each other's performance and say, "Well, you know, that guy's not as committed as I'm committed."
[time=2525] You could be doing better. She could be doing a lot more.
[time=2528] Those are the type of judgments the scriptures encourages command us to avoid.
[time=2534] But the Bible equally as clearly tells us when it is clearly a matter of sin that we're to deal with it.
[time=2545] Not a rumor, not great, fine information, but clearly a matter of sin it is to be dealt with.
[time=2557] It is commonly reported amongst you.
[time=2561] This wasn't a rumor. This was open immorality, known and substantiated.
[time=2567] The Bible says, "Judge, it's not talking about judging differences of interpretations or applications."
[time=2578] We're not supposed to judge each other.
[time=2580] One of you placed cards and your cards go from deuce to ace with faces on them.
[time=2586] Somebody says, "I don't play those cards. I only play Uno. I'm spiritual."
[time=2594] That's not what the Bible says to judge. Don't judge each other.
[time=2601] But when it's an open area of sin, listen to what Paul says, verse 3.
[time=2606] "For I, verily, even though I'm absent, but present in spirit, I've already judged the individual."
[time=2613] You see, wait a minute. Paul, you haven't heard the facts.
[time=2616] You don't know what this guy's been through.
[time=2620] Man, you don't know what this guy's had to put up with in his first four marriages.
[time=2626] Now, hear him out. Give him a chance.
[time=2630] There are no facts that are going to justify immorality.
[time=2635] If you're sleeping with your girlfriend, it's wrong.
[time=2639] If you're sleeping with someone other than your wife, it's wrong.
[time=2644] There are no facts that need to be heard. It is wrong.
[time=2649] Paul said, "I've already judged it." Isn't him there?
[time=2656] Isn't it heard both sides?
[time=2660] Because in memorality, there's only two sides.
[time=2663] They're right and they're wrong, and it's clearly defined.
[time=2671] So he goes on and says, "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, when you're gathered together in my spirit with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such one up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the soul may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
[time=2690] Let me take you to a couple other passages that talk about dealing with sin and how this judgment is to take place.
[time=2699] Turn with me, if you will, to Matthew 18, where our Lord spoke about a similar issue.
[time=2706] Matthew 18 and verse 15, Jesus says these words, "Moreover, if thy brother shall trust pass against thee, go and tell his fault between him and thee, and underline this, at least in your mind, if not in your Bible, alone."
[time=2724] Go and tell it between him and thee alone.
[time=2730] Why?
[time=2731] If he hears you, you've gained your brother.
[time=2735] So you are aware that that one over there is sin.
[time=2740] What's the first thing you do?
[time=2742] Well, the first thing you do is you call a good dozen Christians to pray about it.
[time=2747] Alert the deacons, call the pastor.
[time=2753] No, it says deal with it between the two of you, alone.
[time=2760] The Bible says sin needs to be covered.
[time=2766] It can only be cleansed by the covering of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2771] But even beyond that, there's no value in putting sins out in front of everybody.
[time=2781] Go to them alone.
[time=2782] And what's the goal here?
[time=2783] To restore that person.
[time=2785] Wouldn't it be great if a brother was sinning and somebody came and said, "I love you, and I'm not trying to act like I'm more spiritual than you are, but beloved, this is wrong and the man repents."
[time=2796] Which not only means saying sorry, but changes his disposition.
[time=2801] You've won him.
[time=2803] James chapter 5 verse 19 says, "If any of us convert a sinning brother, we've covered a multitude of sins."
[time=2810] 1 Thessalonians 5, 13 says, "Worn the weak, warn."
[time=2819] Galatians 6, 1 says, "Ye that our spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meatness."
[time=2828] Beloved, how do we judge?
[time=2831] If we see it, we deal with it by lovingly going and appealing to them to walk in obedience.
[time=2837] And if they repent, we've won a brother.
[time=2840] And we're done.
[time=2841] It's over with.
[time=2844] And heaven rejoices.
[time=2848] But what if he or she laughs you off her?
[time=2853] Doesn't hear you out, blows off your opinions.
[time=2857] What do you then do?
[time=2859] Well, verse 16 says, "But if he will not hear thee, that doesn't mean he has an audio pathology problem. It means that he won't listen."
[time=2867] Then take with thee one or two others that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
[time=2873] Go back and try again.
[time=2876] Try a second time.
[time=2878] As the choir's saying, "Go the extra mile." And this time take one or the most to other people.
[time=2884] Not a committee.
[time=2886] There's just one or two that it won't be a matter of, "Well, he said this and I said this." Oh, no, I didn't say that.
[time=2893] It's confirmation.
[time=2897] And then perhaps they'll listen.
[time=2900] And you've won your brother.
[time=2902] You've restored him or her.
[time=2909] What if they still don't listen? Then Jesus says in verse 17, "If you neglect to hear them, then let you tell the whole church."
[time=2919] What does that mean?
[time=2920] I think the best way for us to understand what that means is to return back to 1 Corinthians 5.
[time=2928] Our whole goal in judging sin, and it's not so much judging whether it is sin or it isn't sin.
[time=2935] It is sin and not excusing.
[time=2938] Is to try to restore the brother or sister that's in sin.
[time=2942] That's the goal.
[time=2945] And if we achieve that, then we're done.
[time=2948] But what if you're in a situation where you've done everything that Matthew 18 said when the person still hasn't repented?
[time=2956] What happens then?
[time=2959] Well, not only mourn the sin and secondly judge the sin, then we're forced to, in the way the King James put it, purge out the sin.
[time=2973] There are five different phrases in this chapter that I think all come together to basically say the same thing.
[time=2981] Let me point out those five phrases to you.
[time=2983] The first is found in verse two, mourn that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
[time=2992] Verse five, a second one, not quite as clear.
[time=2996] Deliver such a one unto Satan.
[time=3000] Verse seven, purge out the old leaven.
[time=3006] Verse nine, I wrote unto you not to keep company with fornicators, but don't narrow your list down there.
[time=3014] We haven't picked a pet sin that we're going to go after or covetous or extortioners or idolaters who call themselves brothers.
[time=3028] Don't keep company with them.
[time=3029] Verse 11, it says the same thing, I've written on you not to keep company with them.
[time=3034] And finally in verse 13, this phrase, therefore put away from among you.
[time=3043] Think what all of these phrases are saying is if you've done everything else, you've appealed to them personally.
[time=3052] You've gone back repeatedly to appeal to them and they say, I don't care.
[time=3060] I'm going to do what I want to do.
[time=3062] Well, maybe their tone isn't even that blatant, but their life says, I'm going to keep doing what I want to do.
[time=3067] Now what do you do?
[time=3069] Jesus said you take it before the whole church.
[time=3071] What did that mean?
[time=3072] I think it means what all these phrases and first Corinthians are saying.
[time=3077] You remove the person.
[time=3080] You remove them from the fellowship of the church.
[time=3083] Verse 2 says, mourn so that they'll be taken away.
[time=3086] Verse 13 says, get rid of them.
[time=3088] Verses 11 and 9 say, don't keep company with them.
[time=3092] Verse 7 says, purge it out.
[time=3099] Why do that?
[time=3101] I thought Jesus was this loving, compassionate person who died for the sins of the world.
[time=3105] And Jesus just embraces everybody and so should we.
[time=3110] Matter of fact, I remember somebody was immoral, a bunch of religious, funny duddies like you, cotter.
[time=3117] They drug her before Jesus, bouncing the stones in their hand.
[time=3123] Jesus said, let he was without cinemas, you cast the first stone.
[time=3129] And they all left.
[time=3132] And Jesus said to the woman, I don't condemn you.
[time=3135] That's how I feel.
[time=3137] I feel like anybody who wants to come join, be a member, whatever, whatever they do.
[time=3141] Jesus loves him and so do I.
[time=3146] But you lost one phrase in all of that.
[time=3150] You lost one phrase.
[time=3153] It's the last one that Jesus said under her on that occasion.
[time=3157] Right after Jesus said to her, I don't condemn you either, he said, go and sin no more.
[time=3166] Don't ever forget that.
[time=3167] Well, if you're going to tell that story, don't ever tell it without the last line.
[time=3175] Go and sin no more.
[time=3178] Beloved, if there's someone in sin and we come to them and they'll agree to go and sin no more.
[time=3183] We restored them.
[time=3184] We're done.
[time=3185] We're rejoicing.
[time=3186] We're talking about the one who Jesus says, go and sin no more.
[time=3190] And they say, uh-uh.
[time=3194] Then what do you do?
[time=3197] The Bible says you remove them from amongst us.
[time=3200] Yesterday as we talked about this, one of our men wisely put it this way.
[time=3204] He said it's meant to be a double edged sword.
[time=3207] Two reasons.
[time=3209] The first is, it's for the good of the body of Christ.
[time=3214] Verse 6 says, don't you know that a little 11, 11's the whole long?
[time=3218] If you take some dough and you add yeast, the whole thing is going to grow.
[time=3223] Sin is one of the most prolific parents on the earth.
[time=3230] Sin gives birth to sin.
[time=3235] If it's tolerated, it'll grow.
[time=3242] He says you've got to remove it for the good of the body.
[time=3247] It's contagious.
[time=3249] It's got to be isolated and quarantined.
[time=3253] And then secondly, it's for the good of the individual.
[time=3257] Verse 5, this difficult, difficult phrase.
[time=3261] To deliver such one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.
[time=3266] What does that mean?
[time=3268] I believe that means this.
[time=3270] The church, the body of Christ, this is God's ground.
[time=3273] This is his turf.
[time=3276] The world out there, that's Satan's ground.
[time=3279] That's his turf.
[time=3281] I think the Bible is saying that you remove the person from the fellowship of the church and you give him over to Satan's ground so that he can be chastised.
[time=3291] Physically, God will chastise him.
[time=3294] He may even use Satan unwittingly in his plans.
[time=3299] The Bible is saying let him suffer the consequences of their sin.
[time=3303] They're going to be chastised.
[time=3306] Chapter 11 says that some of them were abusive of a number of things and for that reason they were chastised.
[time=3312] What happened?
[time=3313] Well, some were sick.
[time=3314] Others were weak.
[time=3316] And yes, some of them were dead.
[time=3319] That's the ultimate chastisement.
[time=3321] If we so defame the name of Christ, God may take our life prematurely just so we will quit bringing mockery to his name.
[time=3330] Now notice that if the person's a believer, and that's the only situation we're talking about, it says this, that their spirit might be saved in the end.
[time=3339] God's not going to take their salvation away.
[time=3341] They didn't earn it and they're not going to keep it by their own efforts.
[time=3347] Physically, God may chastise them.
[time=3351] It's painful, but it's God's plan.
[time=3358] I think by way of application we have two responsibilities.
[time=3362] The first sounds just kind of paperwork.
[time=3367] I believe that there's a brother or sister who has been encouraged and admonished and will not repent.
[time=3374] That it's this church's responsibility to write a letter.
[time=3378] To say to that brother that we love you in Christ Jesus and we pray for you and we urge you to repent again as we have before.
[time=3388] But because you have not, you are being notified that you are being dropped
[time=3394] from the membership of this church and ask not to fellowship in any way.
[time=3399] Our doors and our hearts are open to you the day you repent.
[time=3407] I think there's more than just a little letter.
[time=3411] I think there's a second application and that is that we personally withdraw from them.
[time=3415] Bible says in verses 9 and 11 that we don't keep company with such a one.
[time=3420] No, not so much as to eat.
[time=3422] Well, if you can't eat, can you go to the football game if you don't order hot dogs?
[time=3428] I think the phrase eat was simply symbolic of having normal, contact and social relationships with the person.
[time=3435] I think you withdraw from them until they repent.
[time=3441] And someone says, well, that seems so unloving.
[time=3445] Well, make sure you still love them.
[time=3448] Pray for them that they'll repent.
[time=3450] Call them and encourage them to repent, but otherwise withdraw.
[time=3457] These are tough, tough words.
[time=3461] But it's important for us to search the scripture and know what God says.
[time=3469] If it's a matter of human opinion, then it can be rejected humanly.
[time=3473] But if it's what the word says, it's a responsibility for us to keep.
[time=3478] This week we have written such a letter to a brother who has been confronted and would not respond.
[time=3484] We have said to him, we love you.
[time=3489] But you're not a part of us until you repent.
[time=3495] Would you today repent?
[time=3497] Well, you may not have done any of this, but you simply need Christ a Savior.
[time=3501] You open up your heart together.
[time=3503] I pray that you will.

[time=3544] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3549] I ask you to come into my heart today.
