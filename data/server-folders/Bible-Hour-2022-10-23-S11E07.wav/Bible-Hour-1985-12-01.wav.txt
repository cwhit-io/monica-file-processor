[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=131] With inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Off.
[time=140] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=144] (music)
[time=168] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=172] It's a joy to come today and to hear that theme song as we lift our voices singing how great thou art.
[time=180] Though we sing it week by week, it becomes not simply a point of identification and familiarity,
[time=186] but it becomes a testimony, a declaration, a theme of a body of people that believe that God is a great God,
[time=193] and He is worthy of our praise.
[time=195] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning.
[time=198] And we also want to thank our friends who are joining us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=203] We sincerely pray, and we have been praying before this service, that God would use this time to strengthen your faith in Christ.
[time=210] And if you don't know Him, that you might today know Christ as Savior, and you might know of our Savior's love for us.
[time=217] Our choir leads our singing this morning with an anthem of praise that talks about our Savior's love.
[time=225] (music)
[time=235] I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene, and wonder how He could love me.
[time=250] (music)
[time=278] (music) For me it was in the garden, He prayed not my will but thine.
[time=293] He had no tears for His own grace, but sweat for some blood for mine.
[time=303] He took my sills and my sorrows, He made them his very own.
[time=313] He bore the parents to tell me, and suffer in my alone.
[time=325] Oh my blessed, oh wonderful, and my soul shall never be.
[time=336] Oh my blessed, oh wonderful, and my Savior's love for me.
[time=350] (music)
[time=364] Will be my joy through the ages to sing of His love for me.
[time=374] Oh marvelous, oh wonderful, and my soul shall never be.
[time=383] Oh marvelous, oh wonderful, His high sing of God for me.
[time=396] (music)
[time=413] It's marvelous the grace that brought us down, came down to earth, that we might accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and have eternal life.
[time=421] And the peace like a river can flow in our hearts because we have Him as our Savior.
[time=426] Let's continue with our music singing piece.
[time=429] It is well with my soul, Him number 417, 417.
[time=436] (music)
[time=447] Sing together the first, third, and fourth stanzas.
[time=451] (music)
[time=484] It is well with my soul, Him as well with my soul.
[time=504] (music)
[time=525] It is well with my soul, Him as well with my soul, Him as well with my soul, Him as well with my soul.
[time=551] (music)
[time=559] It is well with my soul, Him as well with my soul, Him as well with my soul.
[time=615] Thank you again for your good singing. We appreciate it when you participate in our congregational singing.
[time=622] Let's listen now to the ladies' trios. They sing for us a song that reflects again the love of our Lord and sending His Son to die on the cross for us.
[time=631] The song is entitled, "O Glorious Love." (music)
[time=644] In my darkness Jesus found me, touched my eyes and made me see.
[time=655] Broke since chains that long had bound me, gave me life and liberty.
[time=667] Oh glorious love of Christ, man or divine, that made Him stoop to save us all like mine.
[time=679] Through all my days and men of the world, my soul will fight as ever.
[time=688] I worship Him forever and praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=700] Oh amazing truth to ponder, He whom angels host the tit.
[time=712] Lord of Him God's Son what wonder, He became the sinner's friend.
[time=724] Oh glorious love of Christ, man or divine, that made Him stoop to save us all like mine.
[time=735] Through all my days and men of the world, my soul will fight as ever.
[time=745] I worship Him forever and praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=753] My soul will silence ever, I worship Him forever and praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=765] And praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=785] Well this is our second chance today to welcome you and to thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=797] For those of us here watching live in Fort Wayne this is Thanksgiving weekend and we're busy preparing for the living Christmas tree.
[time=805] But Pete it's hard to believe for those friends in South Bend and Marion that two weeks have gone by and we have already done five concerts by the time they see this.
[time=813] As you mentioned that it kind of startles me to think of the number of opportunities and jobs that have to be done before the tree actually begins.
[time=821] But fortunately now we understand that all of the tickets are gone and people have their tickets and we're excited now to see them come.
[time=829] Pete we are looking forward to the thousands and thousands who will be coming to see the living Christmas tree not just because they're coming to see our efforts but because it's our effort to declare the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=843] Well the theme this year is Sing Christmas and there's a lot of music during the Christmas season but most of all the theme is centered around the manger as the baby comes and we recognize it is indeed our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=854] It will be a very wonderful time to reenact that situation again and realize that Christ came to die for our sins.
[time=861] We wish that we could offer every one of you who are watching a ticket but obviously we cannot do that as a matter of fact we need to do the opposite.
[time=870] If you have tickets that you've received and you're not going to be able to use them after all if you would be so kind as to return those here to the church that would be a major help to us because we have a waiting list of literally hundreds of people at this point.
[time=885] So if you do have tickets if you would take the effort to either mail them tomorrow morning first thing or drop them by the church that would be a big help to us.
[time=895] Rick there is a special concert and that's the premier concert on December 12th.
[time=899] There are tickets available for that that's a unique concert because there'll be a dinner and the proceeds go to the school, the Blackhawk Christian School and I think there are tickets available for that yet.
[time=911] Yes there are and that is a special event that we do as a fundraising event for Blackhawk Christian School and if you would like information please do call us here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=922] Our phone number is 749-8524.
[time=926] We'd love to hear from you and be glad to give you all the information at that time.
[time=931] Well Pete this is a time when you are a victim of an old phrase called the tyranny of the urgent but not just for you but for our television family this month we want to offer this booklet to you if you'll simply write to us.
[time=943] It's entitled the tyranny of the urgent. One of the phrases at the very beginning says do you ever wish you had a 34 hour day? I imagine you'd like to have several of those in the next two weeks.
[time=955] Well many of us are under time pressures. We may be mothers of children who are constantly nipping at our heels or we may be businessmen, we may be teachers regardless of our profession or our calling in life.
[time=968] Many many times we run out of time before we run out of work that needs to be done and we're victims of what this pamphlet calls the tyranny of the urgent.
[time=979] How do you manage those things? Well this author has shown us that Christ was also victimized by that same tyranny but instead of being a victim he was a victor.
[time=990] And if you'd like to know how Christ overcame the tyranny of the urgent we'd like to send you the answer in this booklet called the tyranny of the urgent.
[time=999] If you'll simply write to us today we'll be glad to send you a copy simply write to the Bible hour.
[time=1005] I'd like to encourage our listeners to take advantage of this opportunity and write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1016] That's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1023] Thank you for writing to us your letters that we receive from time to time are a special encouragement to us.
[time=1030] Many of you have written to tell us how the Bible hour has strengthened your faith in Christ and others how you've come to Christ.
[time=1036] Pete last week a young lady came up to me at the end of the service and said I've only been here six weeks.
[time=1042] I'm here while my husband is stationed in North Carolina with the military.
[time=1046] I'm going back to join him today but I wanted you to know that I accepted Christ while I was here.
[time=1051] That is really thrilling. There was another lady that came to the church for the first time who was saved through a friend but had been growing in Christ because she was watching the Bible hour and wanted to come and fellowship with us.
[time=1062] I'm at her after the service Sunday morning.
[time=1065] Well those stories are exciting and many times you write in to share how you've come to Christ.
[time=1070] That means so much to us we do hope that you'll continue to write one final time our address is the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1083] Pete I hope you and your family had a great Thanksgiving weekend.
[time=1087] We had a very quiet but refreshing weekend and good time to share the goodness of the Lord with our immediate family.
[time=1094] Well that's great. One of the things we did we gathered with about 25 family members at my sister's house and her daughter who was a second grader had cut out of construction paper what she called turkey feathers and we each got a turkey feather and we were to write on that one thing that we're thankful for.
[time=1112] What a joy it was to see all the things God had done for our family.
[time=1116] I hope today you have that same spirit of gratitude and thankfulness reflecting on what God has done.
[time=1121] As we study 1 Corinthians this morning we'll find three great occasions for Thanksgiving.
[time=1126] I hope you'll stay with us now listen to the ministry of Marsha Ives as she sings for us.
[time=1144] There was a woman who suffered for many a year.
[time=1155] All her faith was depleted, no shadow of hope.
[time=1165] Then her eyes fell on Jesus to His side she drew near and these words she tenderly spoke.
[time=1186] If I can touch just the hem of His garment, then I know I shall be made whole.
[time=1206] Then by faith she reached out and touched him that day.
[time=1216] From that moment she was made whole.
[time=1226] If I can touch just the hem of His garment, then I know I shall be made whole.
[time=1246] Then by faith she reached out and touched him that day.
[time=1256] From that moment she was made whole.
[time=1266] If I can touch your side where they pierced you.
[time=1276] If only I can see it was all for me.
[time=1286] Then I'd open my heart to receive and don't we believe this promise you've made.
[time=1301] If I can touch just the hem of His garment, then I know I shall be made whole.
[time=1325] Then by faith she reached out and touched him that day.
[time=1335] From that moment she was made whole.
[time=1350] If only you could see it was all for you and me.
[time=1359] Then you'd open your heart to receive and don't we believe this promise you've made.
[time=1374] He's waiting for you, waiting for me.
[time=1384] Jesus is waiting for you.
[time=1404] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1416] Music said William Congrief has charms that calms the savage beast and straightens the knotted oak.
[time=1426] God has used music throughout the ages.
[time=1429] The Psalms say, "Let us come together and sing praises unto our God with thanks." You are God with thanksgiving.
[time=1435] Today we celebrate as a nation and as a people God's blessing.
[time=1440] Let us look to him in prayer.
[time=1445] First to this.
[time=1447] Inasmuch as the great Father has given us this year, an abundant harvest of Indian corn,
[time=1455] wheat, peas, bean squash and garden vegetables and has made the forest to abound with game.
[time=1462] And the sea with fish and clams.
[time=1465] And inasmuch as he has protected us from the ravages of savages, has spared us from pestilence and disease,
[time=1474] has granted us freedom to worship God according to his dictates and the dictates of our conscience.
[time=1482] Now I therefore, your magistrate, do proclaim that all ye pilgrims with your wives and ye little ones,
[time=1490] do gather at ye meeting house on ye hill between the hours of nine and twelve in the daytime
[time=1498] on Thursday, November the 29th of the year of our Lord, 1,623.
[time=1507] And the third year since ye pilgrims landed on ye pilgrim rock, there to listen to ye pastor and to rather render thanksgiving to ye almighty God for all his blessings.
[time=1519] Signed William Bradford, ye governor of e-colony.
[time=1526] God it is with thankful hearts that we come today and it seems strange to us with all of our
[time=1535] abundance that there would be a people who would be thankful for peas and corn and wheat.
[time=1541] God we sit in abundance beyond the imagination of William Bradford and those early founding pilgrims.
[time=1552] Yet God that spirit of gratitude often leaves us because of the abundance we take all that we have for granted.
[time=1560] And God we plead guilty before you of ingratitude.
[time=1566] And we're forced to say thank you for our tribulations because without them we would be totally a thankless people.
[time=1574] But God you've given us enough affliction to remind us that we need you.
[time=1579] And we today come to confirm and to declare our thankfulness to you that all that we have
[time=1585] and all that we possess we know comes down from the Father of Lights with whom there is no variableness or shadow of turning. God the food that we eat with such abundance.
[time=1597] The houses in which we live with such comfort are truly the blessing of God on this land.
[time=1603] And we know that you can take your blessing away as quickly as you've given it.
[time=1608] So today we meet with thankful hearts, praying for this country, for our president and our legislators
[time=1618] and our governors and mayors and councilmen.
[time=1621] That you would give wisdom to them that we would be a nation that seeks after God.
[time=1628] God we are reminded in your word that sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=1634] But righteousness exalts a nation.
[time=1637] And so today we pray for revival in this land.
[time=1641] That those principles of your word that were first embraced by this nation and now shunned
[time=1648] might be returned.
[time=1651] God we pray today that we as a body of people living out a thankful life and gratitude for
[time=1657] your son would be salt and we would be light.
[time=1660] That we would have influence in this land.
[time=1663] So today Father we would pray with thankful hearts and yet with request that this nation might turn
[time=1672] its heart afresh toward God.
[time=1675] Father today more than physical prosperity we thank you for spiritual blessings.
[time=1681] Today even as we study the scriptures we thank you for your word that we know it
[time=1687] and that we have liberty in this land to proclaim it.
[time=1690] We thank you that your word is the liberator of our hearts and your spirit brings about a new birth and that we can be free.
[time=1698] So today God not only for abundance materially but for our benefit spiritually we give you
[time=1705] thanks.
[time=1706] We pray for this body.
[time=1709] We thank you for what you've done in this church and through these ministries.
[time=1713] For the stability and strength of blessing you've poured out.
[time=1717] We thank you for those who've come to Christ in recent days and weeks.
[time=1721] We thank you for those who've turned their heart back towards you.
[time=1725] We thank you for families and individuals who've been healed of damaged emotions.
[time=1730] We thank you for surgeries and healings of success that you've performed.
[time=1736] We pray for the body that has afflicted that your hand of comfort might be upon them.
[time=1742] Through your word now we ask you to speak in Jesus name.
[time=1748] [AMEN] If you have a Bible today we invite you to study with us as always.
[time=1755] We're studying today in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 through 11.
[time=1761] A passage that doesn't leap out as a Thanksgiving passage.
[time=1765] To be honest we're simply studying through this book of the Bible.
[time=1769] This is where we've come.
[time=1771] But yet in this passage not designed as a psalm of thanksgiving there's great occasion for gratitude.
[time=1778] This morning we see what God has done for us in Christ.
[time=1782] The new life that He gives and we have thankfulness in our hearts.
[time=1788] 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9.
[time=1791] No, ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1798] Be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of
[time=1807] themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[time=1816] shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1819] And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified
[time=1832] in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of God.
[time=1840] Doesn't look like a Thanksgiving passage does it?
[time=1843] In our fact many would think that this would be a Sunday where we would avoid such strong
[time=1849] terms and denunciations of sins that are listed there.
[time=1854] Our emphasis will come today on verse 11 and such were some of you.
[time=1859] But to begin with Paul uses that rhetorical device we've seen several times, twice last week that question, do you not know?
[time=1868] No, ye not, in King James, that's one of those questions you'll remember that really wasn't expecting an answer.
[time=1876] It was more of a declaration than it was an interrogative.
[time=1880] And that's a way of emphasizing you should know.
[time=1885] You're responsible to know this.
[time=1888] And so he makes this general statement that each of us, Corinthians, and who's yours alike
[time=1896] should know that the unrighteous does not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1904] Now there's that phrase unrighteous, very general statement.
[time=1908] How do we define that word unrighteousness?
[time=1912] Well society tends to be relative in its description of unrighteousness.
[time=1918] There's a system of thought in studies of history called social Darwinism or social
[time=1924] evolution that sees society is continually progressing from our perspective.
[time=1930] We would see society not as continually progressing, but regressing.
[time=1936] Because with each redefinition of morality, with each new scope of ethics, there is a regression,
[time=1944] a lessening of conviction.
[time=1947] And so each society, as does each individual, defines righteousness and morality based
[time=1953] upon their own comfort zones.
[time=1956] If you allow me to be the sole author of a definition of what is righteousness, I will very quickly list all the things that are wrong that I don't do.
[time=1968] And probably comfortably leave off those that I do do.
[time=1974] That's our humanity, both individually and collectively, to define righteousness within
[time=1981] terms of our own comfort.
[time=1984] We do not declare that as unrighteous very often of which we are guilty.
[time=1990] It's a very general statement.
[time=1992] How do we then give definition to that?
[time=1995] Well in the next phrases, Paul lists ten different sins.
[time=1999] Many of those strike at us and with the most minimal of ethical backgrounds, we would say that's clearly wrong.
[time=2007] That there are some in there that we would find it very uncomfortable to cure 45 minutes
[time=2014] of sermon.
[time=2015] We'd find it uncomfortable to hear 45 minutes of sermon on anything, but these in particular.
[time=2020] Notice wedged in the middle of such things as immorality and stealing or phrases like
[time=2027] covetousness, which in the new international puts this way, greedy.
[time=2034] While many of us may raise our hands today and cry innocent to homosexuality or immorality
[time=2041] that's listed there, not many hands would go up for innocent of greed.
[time=2050] Or how about the phrase that comes near the end that is called revilers, which is really
[time=2058] slanderers, which means anyone who maliciously uses their tongue to disfame or even discourage
[time=2066] someone else, or perhaps to gossip.
[time=2074] Perhaps the greatest perspective of what the unrighteous is is found in Romans.
[time=2080] Chapter 3 verses 9 and 10 where it says, "There's none righteous, no, not even one."
[time=2086] It's almost as the Apostle Paul anticipated an objection there.
[time=2089] He said, "There's no one who's ever been righteous past, present, or future." It was as though he expected somebody back in the room to say, "Oh, come on." He said, "No, not one." Isn't that amazing that by God's definition of the 12, 13, 1400 of us here today, God
[time=2110] says, "There's not one of us that are righteous." We expand that to this nation of 200 plus million people and there's not one of us who's righteous.
[time=2120] The world is sagging under the weight of about four and a half billion of us and there's
[time=2126] not one of us who is righteous and throughout history there's been about four billion that
[time=2132] have preceded those of us who are alive and not one of them has been righteous.
[time=2138] No, not even one.
[time=2141] As a matter of fact, Paul said in Romans 3, "None even seeks after God."
[time=2150] As a matter of fact, the very best of us, whoever that may be, please don't raise your
[time=2160] hand, but the very best of us on our very best day is described in Isaiah 6th and 8th
[time=2171] and 64, 6th in this way.
[time=2174] All of our righteousness is as filthy rags before God.
[time=2181] You take a rag that has been used to clean up the oil on the garage floor that had previously
[time=2188] been used to clean up the lasagna off your son's face that was previously used to clean
[time=2194] out the sink and you take that rag and you look at it and it's so repulsive to look at
[time=2200] it and God said, "That's the best of us on our best day." Anybody want any Polaroid snapshots to take home?
[time=2211] The Bible then says this, "Not only are all of us unrighteous, but that the unrighteous
[time=2218] shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Now of course he does list 10 specific sins there, but that's more or less just to get their wheels turning.
[time=2230] Next week we'll look at that at Greater Langton we'll discover in the Corinthian's mind that none of these things were vices, they saw them all as virtues, but God says the very
[time=2242] best of us are unrighteous and none who are unrighteous will inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2247] Well you don't have to be a master in syllogistic thinking or in logic if you just start off with this major thesis, all have sinned, minor thesis, anyone who sins cannot go to heaven
[time=2261] then your syllogistic logic says no one's going to heaven because all have sinned.
[time=2266] But look at verse 11 and this is the point to be excited.
[time=2271] This is the place to give thanks for.
[time=2274] The whole book of Corinthians and I've looked at it many times and I'm sure you have too, this is the phrase that grabs my heart with joy.
[time=2282] It says this, "And such were some of you."
[time=2292] He says you Corinthians, some of you were immoral, some of you were covetous, some of
[time=2299] you were slanderous, some of you cheated on your expense account and were extortioners,
[time=2307] but notice he says you were, there's been a change in life.
[time=2315] Jesus Christ can bring a change in life.
[time=2320] He's able to take a life and transform it and take it from what it has been and completely
[time=2326] alter it.
[time=2328] This past year I saw that testimony before my very eyes and what an influence a changed
[time=2335] life can have when the word of God fits someone and it says, "But such were some of you."
[time=2342] Some of you may have come to know Christ as Savior because somebody in your high school gave their life to Christ and there was a night and day change.
[time=2351] I visited in a home about five years ago, knocked on the door.
[time=2355] I started to introduce myself and a man said, "I know who you are and I know what you've come to talk about and then he named a high school student." He said, "And I know it works because he's in my class a changed life."
[time=2371] This past year God's blessed my family, one of my co-tell in-laws or outlaws, I'm not
[time=2377] sure which, but this guy was a friend but he was a rascal and just about anything that
[time=2383] we would say, "Oh no," he said, "Oh yes," it was unfaithful to his wife and open about
[time=2391] it.
[time=2393] He was totally irresponsible as a father.
[time=2396] The few words he ever said to his kids were totally discouraging but Jesus Christ came
[time=2403] into his heart last January and what a change he made and an 84-year-old grandfather watched
[time=2411] this young man's life at 39 be changed, revolutionized and an 84-year-old grandfather who never
[time=2419] had time for God said, "If it can do that in his life, I want Christ in mind."
[time=2426] Maybe that's how you've come to know the Lord.
[time=2428] You've seen a change in a family member, you've seen a change in a businessman's life, you've
[time=2434] changed the change in a neighbor's life, you've seen a change in a student's life, that's what Paul was saying here, "Yes, we're all sinners but there is a change that is possible."
[time=2446] He said, "The Corinthians, but you've been changed.
[time=2449] You were that way and such were some of you." And then he uses the word "but" three times.
[time=2456] Usually, "but" is a let down but this time a "but" is a build up.
[time=2461] How does God change a life by doing three things?
[time=2465] Paul says, "But you were washed." "Washed." You know, they're things that because they're dirty, they're not very touchable, they're not embraceable.
[time=2478] We've got a classic picture in our family box of pictures of our oldest daughter Rachel at age two.
[time=2485] Spaghetti was one of her favorite foods to wear.
[time=2490] She had this blended spaghetti that she had chased around the bowl for a lengthy period of time, had finished eating and thought it would make a beautiful hat.
[time=2500] And she simply picked up the bowl, turned it upside down, sat on her hat, beaming with
[time=2506] a smile.
[time=2508] Spaghetti dripping out the sides is long, beautiful tresses waiting to be combed.
[time=2513] Then with that spaghetti from ear to ear and hand to hand, she reaches up, "Daddy!"
[time=2520] "Honey, your mother will be with you in just a moment."
[time=2528] I know that kid.
[time=2530] That was mine.
[time=2531] I recognize that, but there was something about that child that wasn't particularly embraceable.
[time=2539] You know, God looks down at us as His children.
[time=2541] He says, "I love you, I love you, but you're not embraceable."
[time=2549] That's more than spaghetti and meat sauce that makes you repugnant, it is your sin.
[time=2558] God says, "You've dressed up today, you've put on your good behavior, you've got your
[time=2566] Sunday morning going to meet and close on, and your best disposition, and on your best
[time=2572] day God said, "Hocks, beloved, you are as filthy rags, I can't embrace you."
[time=2582] Corinthians, such were some of you, and I couldn't embrace you, but you've been washed.
[time=2592] Isaiah chapter 1 verse 18, God says, "Come, let us reason together, though your sins
[time=2601] be a scarlet, they shall be as wool, though they be like crimson, they shall be as white
[time=2608] as snow." He said, "I can take that stain, that stain that has marked your life, and I can wash
[time=2616] it, and I can get it out." We are inundated, aren't we, with television commercials, particularly the laundry detergent
[time=2626] type.
[time=2627] If you'll notice, every laundry detergent is not just regular.
[time=2632] It is either new, and once you have bought new, they come out with new and improved,
[time=2638] new, super improved, and the list of superlatives and adjectives goes on, and they bring some
[time=2644] kid in who looks like every one of ours, who has just been through every type of dirt possible and say, "We can get this dirt out," but you know the very superst of detergents.
[time=2657] The most superlative of behavior cannot get the stain of sin out.
[time=2662] There is nothing that can take sin out.
[time=2666] There is no cleansing process that you can go through that can take the stain of sin away
[time=2673] except for one thing.
[time=2675] Hebrews 9, 22 says this, "Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin."
[time=2686] What can take away sin?
[time=2688] The Bible says nothing but the shedding of blood.
[time=2693] That is a way of saying that life is in the blood from Leviticus, and the soul that sins as Ezekiel said shall die.
[time=2700] That means that because I am a sinner, I am going to die, not only physically but spiritually,
[time=2707] because there is sin that only death can wash away.
[time=2713] But God says, "I love you, I can't embrace you because of your sin, so I'll wash you."
[time=2722] And I'll send my son Jesus Christ, the infinite God-man, man in that he could die infinite
[time=2729] and his death could be efficacious for the world, and he will die, and his blood will
[time=2737] be shed because without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.
[time=2744] That's why the hymn writer wrote, "Oh, precious, is that flow?
[time=2751] That makes me white as snow?
[time=2754] No other fount I know.
[time=2756] Nothing but the blood of Jesus."
[time=2762] What can wash away my sin?
[time=2764] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=2769] It seems crude to a society that prides itself in our sophistication to talk about blood.
[time=2778] We're actually talking about life.
[time=2781] God gave his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die that his blood might give us life.
[time=2790] And such were some of you, but you were washed.
[time=2795] God says, "I stand as the cleansing agent, and I will wash you, and I will make you clean,
[time=2803] that I can embrace you." And secondly, it says this, "But you were washed, but you were sanctified."
[time=2811] Now there's a word that receives great misunderstanding, particularly by those who misrepresent Christianity
[time=2818] and those who misunderstand it both.
[time=2822] Obviously the word sanctified and the word saint are related.
[time=2826] Someone who is sanctified is someone who is a saint.
[time=2830] We tend to think of saints as one of two things, both of which are wrong.
[time=2835] One image of saint is somebody who lived a long, long time ago.
[time=2839] And for their unusual life they had a marble etching of themselves made and put in a museum.
[time=2847] The other image is that person who thinks that they're holy and projects that they're
[time=2857] holier than now.
[time=2860] Either one of those terms is particularly winsome to us, or appealing.
[time=2865] Fortunately, they're both wrong.
[time=2868] The word saint simply means, as we've already eluded, someone who's sanctified and someone who is sanctified is someone who has simply been washed and set apart for special use.
[time=2882] After God washes us, all of us who are sinners, none of us are better than another, but after
[time=2889] God washes us, He then claims us as His own and He puts us in His group, if you will.
[time=2895] He says, "You belong to me, and now you're separate from all other people.
[time=2901] You belong to my class." We don't walk around with air of superiority because anyone can belong to that class, but
[time=2910] we are set apart, put into a special group.
[time=2915] God says, "I want to set you apart." Jesus said, "I love you so much.
[time=2921] I want to make you the church, all believers who've been washed.
[time=2924] I want to make you my bride, but I have to set you apart to do that."
[time=2932] In 1711, Peter Romanov, known as Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia wanted to marry a young
[time=2940] woman by the name of Catherine, but he could not.
[time=2945] Where you see, Peter the Great of the House of Romanov, of course, was a nobleman, and
[time=2951] it was strictly forbidden that somebody of noble birth should marry someone of common
[time=2958] heritage, and that was Catherine.
[time=2963] She was a peasant girl.
[time=2966] She was not of nobility, and it was forbidden for Peter to marry her.
[time=2974] Peter the Great was great because he was smart.
[time=2978] What Peter did is he took Catherine's brother and inducted him into the military.
[time=2983] He earned his way, but Peter made sure that he was promoted along the way, and then as a reward for a military service, Peter gave Catherine's brother a sizable piece of ground,
[time=2994] which made him a landowner.
[time=2998] As he was a landowner, now he was eligible to be made of nobility, and Peter made of Catherine's
[time=3005] brother a noble, and then Catherine's brother took Catherine into his own home, and she
[time=3012] became the sister of nobility, and Peter could marry her.
[time=3020] But first, she had to be set apart.
[time=3024] From all the rest of the Russians, first, she had to be set apart.
[time=3031] God said, "My son, Jesus Christ, died for your sins, and he wants you, the church is his bride, but first he has to set you apart." God not only cleansed this, but he said, "I've made of you nobility.
[time=3044] I've made of you my sons and my daughters, but to as many as receive him to them he gave
[time=3050] the power to become the children of God, to be set apart as belonging to him." Do you belong to him today?
[time=3057] Have you been set apart as a member of the family of God?
[time=3061] Oh, it's not a place of arrogance, to claim superiority to any other person, for we are
[time=3068] not.
[time=3070] He has set us apart, and he's willing to set apart each one who will, by faith, come to him.
[time=3075] And such were some of you, but you've been washed.
[time=3081] Secondly, you've been sanctified.
[time=3083] And then thirdly, he says, "You have been justified." What does that word "justified" mean?
[time=3089] Well, it means someone who is free of unrighteousness.
[time=3094] It's a legal term in many senses.
[time=3097] It's almost as though there is a ledger being kept of crimes committed, perhaps sins, perhaps
[time=3104] acts of omission, knowing that we should have done something and we didn't.
[time=3109] At the end of that ledger, the line is drawn, and the penalty is added.
[time=3120] And the penalty is death, sin is a capital offense, but the word "justified" means to
[time=3131] have the ledger cleared, to clear the ledger.
[time=3137] Someone said that "justified" is in a grammatical device and onomatopoeia.
[time=3142] It's a word that sounds like what it is.
[time=3145] Just say it syllabically, "justified." Just is "ified," never sin.
[time=3153] What God wants to do is to take the ledger of our sins and to eliminate that ledger and
[time=3159] make it just as if we had never sinned, justify us of all unrighteousness.
[time=3166] How can he do that?
[time=3168] Romans 3 tells us again that "all have sinned and come sure to the glory of God," but it goes on to say, "but we've been justified freely by His grace through the redemption
[time=3179] that is in Christ Jesus." To declare I say it this time, His righteousness, that He might be both just and the justifier
[time=3190] of us.
[time=3192] What God did was He wrote in Jesus Christ a pardon so that our ledger could be forgiven
[time=3200] and a journal transfer, if you will, was made from Christ, a count of righteousness to us.
[time=3208] And from our account of sin to Christ, what an exchange.
[time=3214] What a deal.
[time=3215] Any time you can trade someone's sin for righteousness, take them up on that.
[time=3220] But the only time you'll ever be able to do that is with the person of Jesus Christ who is willing to give you His robe of righteousness for your stained rags of sin.
[time=3230] And then we're legally justified before Him.
[time=3236] In the year 1781, a man by the name of Herschel looked through a telescope and saw for the
[time=3244] first time what no one else had ever seen.
[time=3247] At first he thought it a star, but by later observation he discovered it was a planet, the planet Uranus.
[time=3254] He discovered its satellites.
[time=3256] He discovered that it was different than all the other planets in its rotation.
[time=3260] He began to make observations and his observations went into a journal.
[time=3265] And he was recognized as a man of great accomplishment.
[time=3269] And Herschel was summoned before the king to receive honour and distinction, but he couldn't
[time=3279] go.
[time=3280] For you see, Herschel had years before been a servant in the military of King George, and
[time=3290] in the heat of battle he turned and ran.
[time=3293] He was never caught.
[time=3296] It was never known that it was him.
[time=3301] And now he was to go stand before the king.
[time=3304] Someone else had known and someone else had told King George.
[time=3308] And so for King George to admit him into his palace, a deserter in battle could not be
[time=3315] done, but he was summoned to the palace.
[time=3322] He stood outside the door and an envelope was given to him with the instructions to read this before entering to see the king.
[time=3330] He opened the envelope and he read what was in it.
[time=3334] It was a pardon.
[time=3337] The king had written out a full and complete pardon.
[time=3341] And now he could enter and be embraced and received by his king.
[time=3348] For our king, the Lord Jesus Christ, can embrace us and receive us.
[time=3354] We must be justified.
[time=3356] We must receive a pardon.
[time=3359] He extends an envelope to you and he says, "Read it.
[time=3363] Read it." And inside it says, "If we will by faith receive him, that he will forgive us of our sins and
[time=3372] come into our life." All said, and such were some of you, but what had happened to them?
[time=3382] They had been washed.
[time=3385] They had been sanctified.
[time=3392] A closing thought here, you don't have to be an expert and grammar, but just notice the
[time=3401] verbs washed, sanctified, justified.
[time=3413] You notice something?
[time=3415] In grammar they're what we would call passive verbs.
[time=3420] That doesn't mean they lack energy, but by passive it means that the subject didn't
[time=3426] do the work but received it.
[time=3430] It doesn't say here that we washed ourselves, that we sanctified ourselves, that we justified ourselves.
[time=3436] No, it says God washed us.
[time=3440] God sanctified us.
[time=3443] He did it all and tells us his methodology, says this in verse 11.
[time=3452] God has done all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of God.
[time=3464] You today can be washed, sanctified, and justified, by believing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[time=3471] Christ and by receiving His Spirit, the new birth.
[time=3477] You know the great difficulty is, these verbs are passive.
[time=3481] And that means you have to allow God to do it to you.
[time=3485] And many of us find thanksgiving so difficult, because pride says, "I don't want to tell anybody
[time=3492] else thankful.
[time=3493] I've done it my own, it's my life, I've made the breaks."
[time=3500] Thanksgiving requires of us to admit our need for someone else, namely God.
[time=3514] Thank you for joining us for this telecast today.
