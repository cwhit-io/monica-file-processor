[time=0] I for thee and my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus, My heart for thee.
[time=15] Please remain standing in a moment we're going to bow in prayer and then we'll sing together.
[time=19] Him number 801, How great thou are. Let us pray as Pastor George Lattman comes to lead us.
[time=29] God our heavenly Father, we contemplate the fact that there is room for all who come to Christ.
[time=41] Not as when Christ was born in that major where there was no room, but there is room.
[time=48] And His arm is not short and everything you did. It reaches out to all in His Christmas time.
[time=55] They came coming to me, all the labor, heavy labor, and I will give you rest. Rest in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=62] The rest of the sure as us that we will have be turned to be in heaven. The rest of the sure as us that Jesus Christ paid it all when he hung until his cross.
[time=73] So as we think about this Christmas season and meditate upon the birth of Christ, the minister recognized that he came for one purpose and that is to die, or sinners, that we might have the righteousness of Christ, and we might be acceptable to Holy God.
[time=89] So we would pray as we...
[time=91] Have this hour of service that we may focus our attention upon Him, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=98] He may have preeminence in His service in our hearts and lives, and we may take Him with us day by day, week by week,
[time=106] that we may know that we have Him in our heart and others may know it also.
[time=110] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=114] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour.
[time=122] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=131] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=136] When I hear awesome water, constant law, I hear you.
[time=146] I sing a song, I hear you calling for her.
[time=151] I love you all, and you hear her sing.
[time=157] I sing a song, I sing around the sea, I pray now.
[time=167] I pray now.
[time=169] I sing twice, all of my Savior, around the sea.
[time=176] I pray now.
[time=187] Would you just put your hymnals aside, please, and sing that chorus again and just raise it unto the Lord, sing it.
[time=193] I sing twice, all of my Savior, around the sea.
[time=200] I pray now, all of my Savior, around the sea.
[time=234] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=244] My heart, I'm placing no one else could fear.
[time=261] So if your spirit broke in in me, I could lock in light, honestly, unto the fame I will lead way to the truth.
[time=274] That I found in you, I never knew just how good it could be to stand in your presence totally free now and for giving.
[time=285] Now I have a reason for living.
[time=289] Jesus keeps giving and giving, giving to my heart of applause.
[time=298] I can see me as a person who's free, even when I slip and fall.
[time=305] You are a God who forgives and forgets.
[time=309] Now I want to give you my all, because I'm forgiven.
[time=314] Now I have a reason for living.
[time=318] Jesus keeps giving and giving, giving to my heart of applause.
[time=326] I know this love you've placed in my heart is a love that will never depart.
[time=334] Sing from me here to the end of my role.
[time=338] But now you've given me a brand new hope, because I've forgiven.
[time=345] I've forgiven, I've forgiven, I have a reason for living.
[time=350] When Jesus keeps giving and giving, giving to my heart of applause.
[time=359] I've forgiven, I've forgiven, I have a reason for living.
[time=365] Jesus keeps giving and giving, giving to my heart of applause.
[time=372] I've forgiven, I've forgiven, giving to my heart of applause.
[time=381] I've forgiven.
[time=385] Forgiven this morning as we come to a time of Bible study in the moments ahead,
[time=398] we'll discover that Jesus Christ is able to save them to the utmost that come unto him for forgiveness.
[time=406] Today we have as our special musical guest, a group from Grace College entitled Sound Investment. This past summer, Kathy and I had the privilege of going to Colorado for a week and there to be a part of the Brother and National Youth Conference.
[time=419] And this group, or at least part of this group, we've got some new faces, we're a part of that conference, ministered so effectively in song to young people and adults alike. We're delighted to have you here today. Thank you for ministering to us. Thank you for coming this morning that we can celebrate God's forgiveness here today. We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour. We trust today that God will use this service in each of our lives to focus our attention on the fact that Jesus Christ died on the old rugged cross to give us today forgiveness. Listen as the sound
[time=454] investment now sings about the old rugged cross, the place where Christ purchased our forgiveness.
[time=489] Nothing in my hand I breathe, simply to the cross I clean. I will cling to that old rugged cross.
[time=518] For it was bare that he suffered and died. Nothing in my hand I breathe, simply to the cross I clean.
[time=537] I will cling to that old rugged cross.
[time=550] I have found new life today. My sins are washed away. There is power in the blood of the bird.
[time=567] Jesus blood has made a way to that land of fairest day. I will cling to that old rugged cross.
[time=586] I will cling to that old rugged cross. For it was bare that he suffered and died.
[time=604] Nothing in my hand I breathe, simply to the cross I clean. I will cling to that old rugged cross.
[time=621] Though I'll cherish the old rugged cross, till my trophies have last night laid down.
[time=638] I will cling to that rugged cross. And it changed its someday for a crown.
[time=656] I will cling to the old rugged cross.
[time=667] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. We've enjoyed the music of the
[time=682] sound investment from Grace College and looking forward to hearing from them again in just a little bit. They are here to encourage us musically today as our music department has been very busy
[time=693] getting ready for the living Christmas tree. Yes I want to say thank you too to sound investment for their ministry with us today. Rick the choir worked really hard last week in their final
[time=703] preparation for the living Christmas tree and all the music that we'll hear in the coming week.
[time=708] Yesterday there were a lot of men here getting the steel put in the back rooms and this afternoon we'll begin erecting the tree. Well it's hard to believe that this convocation center which looks
[time=719] as normal as could be will be the home of the living Christmas tree in just three and a half days from now and I'm sure you're totally ready. There's a lot of work to be done but we have a lot of good volunteers. I think it's exciting to see that there are probably as many or more people that work behind the scenes in preparing for the tree as those that sing in the tree and that says something for the members and friends of our church. We wish that we could tell you to call
[time=744] us today and we would get tickets for you but we cannot do that. All of the tickets are gone and the waiting list is well into the dozens perhaps hundreds of people waiting for tickets. However
[time=755] we can invite you to see the living Christmas tree right here on television. For the next three Sunday mornings our choirs will be singing sometimes the school choir, sometimes the youth choir, sometimes the adult choir. Is that right? Right we have a variety on Sunday mornings and we'll have the opportunity for people to view the tree with several different choirs in the tree.
[time=775] So if you just join us for the Bible hour over the next three Sundays you'll be able to see the living Christmas tree in part and then particularly at 8.30 on Christmas Eve. Again that's at 8.30 on
[time=787] Christmas Eve right here on channel 21 in Fort Wayne. We will be able to broadcast a living
[time=793] Christmas tree television special so I hope you friends in Fort Wayne will be able to join us for the living Christmas tree at 8.30 on December the 24th. Pete you have a helpful booklet during these
[time=804] times when everyone is so busy that talks about the tyranny of being so busy it's entitled The
[time=810] Tyranny of the Urgent. Right Rick you know there's a statement right at the beginning of the book that says do you wish that you had 30 hours in the day and about right now I would wish for that
[time=820] because of the many things that have to be done but I suppose there'd be other things that would crowd into those 30 hours and we'd want to extend it into a 48 hour day. The booklet talks about the
[time=830] tyranny of the Urgent and also often compares what is urgent with what is important and unfortunately
[time=837] those things that are urgent take precedent over things that really are important and that's things like praying to our Heavenly Father reading the scripture and communing with God.
[time=847] So we'd like to encourage you to write for this little booklet entitled The Tyranny of the Urgent and you can receive that by writing to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip
[time=859] code is 46815. The booklet is entitled Tyranny of the Urgent it's by Charles E. Hummel and you can
[time=866] receive it by writing to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Thank you Pete and while
[time=875] we're talking to people about writing for this helpful booklet I want to remind many of our friends who received a letter from us about a special project we're doing to raise some money for some
[time=886] new television equipment. If you receive that letter I hope that you'll read it and give it prayerful consideration. Then it has crossed our minds that many many of you may have thought of supporting the Bible hour in some way but you've not on our mailing list and don't know what we're talking about. May I encourage you as we come to the end of this year if you've been thinking about supporting the Bible hour now would be a great time to do that. Pete would you give them the address one final time please? Yes we encourage you to write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=917] and the zip code is 46815. Thank you Pete and do remember that you can join us for the living
[time=923] Christmas tree television special at 8.30 on Christmas Eve. We'll look forward to seeing you
[time=930] on television if we can't see you here in the Convocation Center. Now as we go back to our morning worship service we'll hear again from the ministry of sound investment.

[time=1264] It was a joy to stand back from the back and to listen to you congregation here sing how great thou art and just the number here was really a blessing to me but you know there's gonna be something so much better than that that's when we are in heaven sitting around or standing around on the throne of God and us with the angels giving him the praise in all the glory.
[time=1309] In the highest worthy to merit our praise for a thousand tongues to sing praises unto thee.
[time=1339] All for a thousand hands to raise an honor to the King.

[time=1383] let oration in endless refrain. All for a thousand tongues to sing praises unto thee.
[time=1413] All for a thousand hands to raise an honor to the King.

[time=1471] Thank you again sound investment for your ministry this morning and we're looking forward to our
[time=1489] service with you tonight at six o'clock well today it's my privilege to make an additional announcement that is good news this morning at six o'clock my telephone rang now that's not the
[time=1500] good news the good news is it was Dale Johnson our business administrator to let me know that
[time=1506] they had a baby girl an hour earlier this morning and both mother father and proud daughter are
[time=1513] all doing well today that's such a great cause of rejoicing for them many of you know a year ago
[time=1519] they lost a child at birth this has been a time of great joy but also apprehension and today we
[time=1525] celebrate the fact that God has been faithful he was their God when they lost a child is their
[time=1531] God today is a yours God we look at birth and it is such a natural process of life until something
[time=1540] goes wrong and then we recognize that there is a God who is in control and dictates according to
[time=1548] his will today God we celebrate with joy and thanksgiving for a precious baby girl a living
[time=1555] hope to her parents father today we would rejoice with Dale and Annette and your gift to them
[time=1563] we today pray that with this good news there would also be a comfort to others who have lost children
[time=1570] there's always a grim reminder the holidays an empty room shoes that have no feet to go in them
[time=1579] God be the God of all comfort to those who have lost their children we pray that you would be the
[time=1587] God of all comfort to others who have not so much lost their children and that they have died but
[time=1593] through disappointment rebellion they're gone God today we pray that you would bring healing to
[time=1599] damaged relationships between parent and children between husband and wife we pray today that you
[time=1608] would be with Paul and Elson's brother Huey Durham as he recovers from open heart surgery that you would give recovery there we pray for Helen Weimer and Phyllis Hopkins and Mary Lampman and Hazel
[time=1620] Huber as they battle cancer we pray today for those who are spiritually searching and have not
[time=1628] come to the place where they have found Christ as Savior that today you would speak to their hearts
[time=1635] Father as we study your word we ask for you to speak take control of my mouth and of each ear
[time=1643] that's listening so your word might be clear in its presentation and its reception in Jesus name
[time=1654] amen please open your Bibles this morning to 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and we'll continue in our
[time=1662] study of the book of 1 Corinthians this morning this will be our last study in 1 Corinthians next
[time=1669] week we will change to a Christmas theme and then in January we will come back to 1 Corinthians but
[time=1675] today a final message for the year 1985 out of 1 Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verses 9
[time=1685] through 11 Paul writes by the inspiration of our God no ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[time=1695] the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor
[time=1707] abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners
[time=1716] shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified
[time=1729] but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God 1 Corinthians chapter
[time=1742] 6 and verses 9 through 11 as we read those verses this morning those are the same verses that we
[time=1750] read and studied last week today we want to take a more particular focus on what is being said there
[time=1757] there are 10 specific sins that are listed and to be sure that's not an all-inclusive list of
[time=1764] all the sins that could possibly be committed that's just a random sample if you will
[time=1770] this morning i would like to pick out two of those 10 and talk about those now i say pick out not pick on some today may feel like i've picked on two particular sins
[time=1784] well rest assured that when we come back to this study in january i'll pick out a few more last sunday night or sunday night ago we spoke about one of them that's mentioned covetousness
[time=1797] niv translation puts it greedy and we talked about that well this morning i'm picking out two
[time=1803] these two sins are often misrepresented i believe when people open their bibles
[time=1810] i believe some take and they don't like what the word of god says so they take and they reinterpret these passages of scripture to a more permissive type of lifestyle so as to grant what
[time=1823] the bible really does not grant others take these two sins and only declare the fact that god
[time=1831] calls them sin and never moves on to the fact that god calls them forgivable sins
[time=1837] so today we look for balance and clarity and truth and so we've prayed that god would teach us
[time=1843] i am no more capable of living above prejudice as i interpret the scriptures as is anyone else
[time=1850] objectivity does not call my house home i need it as much as the next person today we look at two sins out of this list they are as the king james put it effeminate
[time=1863] and abusers of themselves with mankind in a word today we are speaking about homosexuality
[time=1871] and i would like to share good news with you that the bible says four things in this passage about
[time=1879] homosexuality the first is this the bible classifies homosexuality as sin there are these two words
[time=1892] in the text effeminate and abusers of themselves with mankind the english language is constantly
[time=1899] in a state of change what words meant last year may not mean the same this year
[time=1906] what words meant in the days of king james may not at all mean the same today
[time=1912] i think it's unfortunate that this word effeminate is there because we have confused what the word
[time=1918] of god is saying there english language always changes when i was in high school the word heavy
[time=1924] meant one thing to a high school student and a completely different thing to the high school students parents if someone said that's heavy that meant that they liked it in high school
[time=1934] when the high school students parents stepped on the scale and said that's heavy that meant they didn't like it it was a word that was used very differently well this word effeminate is used in a completely different meaning today than in the king james day let's avoid the english
[time=1950] confusion and allow me to tell you what i believe the greek word means the greek word is the word
[time=1957] that originally meant soft not a sexual word at all just this is soft this is hard
[time=1964] but as it was begun to be used in some different areas it began to use by greek writers to describe
[time=1971] something that was soft or feminine and then later it was used to describe a male who wanted to become
[time=1979] female inversion in the technical word role change now the bible here is not labeling someone
[time=1989] as a sinner who happens to be a male who has some more feminine like qualities for example
[time=1997] some men have a beard by noon others have a shave every day but put blades in on monday
[time=2008] well just because one guy shaves more than the other guy doesn't mean this guy is masculine and this guy is feminine just because a man likes music and doesn't like rugby
[time=2020] is not what the text is referring to here i used to like rugby i'm 33 i like music better now
[time=2030] it's not those classifications of modern terminology of stereotyping people not at all
[time=2036] the effeminate that it's speaking about here is someone who consciously takes on a female role
[time=2045] to be quite honest with you the bible is being very specific very graphic in its language
[time=2056] the word here that is being called effeminate by king james refers to a male homosexual who
[time=2063] in a homosexual relationship takes on the role of female in the next phrase abusers of themselves
[time=2070] with mankind refers to a male homosexual who maintains a male identification in that relationship
[time=2080] and here the bible is listing homosexuality very clearly as sin romans chapter one just to fill
[time=2087] on the blank labels female homosexuality lesbianism as sin as well it says this in verse 26 of romans
[time=2097] one because of this god gave them over to shameful lust even their women exchanged the natural
[time=2104] relationships for unnatural ones in the same way men also abandoned the natural relations
[time=2111] with women and were inflamed with their last one toward another men committed in decent acts with men
[time=2118] refers to homosexuality again there first timothy chapter one verses nine through 11
[time=2126] speak equally as graphically about homosexuality and again classify it clearly as a sin
[time=2135] there are those who want to be proponents of homosexuality and at the same time proponents of biblical study who have tried to reinterpret scripture differently than has
[time=2149] been traditionally thought and as i've presented them today they take romans chapter one and say
[time=2156] well romans chapter one says they were doing that which is unnatural and we as homosexuals
[time=2162] agree that it is unnatural for someone who is heterosexual to act homosexual and so if you're
[time=2168] heterosexual and act homosexual that's sin but if you're homosexual and that's natural to you
[time=2174] and you act heterosexual that's sin too that's not at all what the text is saying that's simply attempt to take the scriptures and make it give a green light a permission
[time=2187] where it does not and so they come to first print in six and say no paul's not here calling homosexuality sin but homosexual prostitution sin well to be honest the words
[time=2198] have been used in that way in greek literature but that's not the primary usage or the intent here
[time=2204] in a similar way proponents of homosexuality have taken other passages of the bible
[time=2211] that spoke nothing of sexuality and have read into them whole sexuality where it's not there the most classic example of that is the relationship between jonathan and david
[time=2223] in first sam new eighteen david said that his soul was knit together with jonathan's as one
[time=2231] and that he loved jonathan and then when jonathan is dead
[time=2238] david laments his death and says that jonathan's love for him was wonderful and in this phrase
[time=2245] surpassing the love of a woman the homosexual community of
[time=2251] proponents have jumped on that verse to say see david and jonathan were homosexuals
[time=2259] there is nothing in this text that speaks about sexuality beloved tragic is your life if
[time=2268] every time the word love is mentioned it means sex to you love and sex may have some points of overlap but they are not the same
[time=2278] david is not here speaking of an erotic love but a far greater love a love that can go on between
[time=2286] two men two women men and women man and god it was simply saying that there was a commitment
[time=2293] of faithfulness a loyalty and a dependence on each other that david had had with no one else in his life to be sure david was not a homosexual if you will not believe me ask bath shiba
[time=2307] now some will jump up and say well he was ambosexual or bisexual beloved that's reaching out for what you want and trying to find it when it's not there
[time=2321] unfortunately we live in a time when there are those who take the scriptures and reinterpret them to make them say what they want
[time=2331] paul warned of that in second timothy chapter four verse three when he said the time will come when
[time=2337] men will not endure sound doctrine but will he put themselves teachers according to their lust
[time=2344] having itching ears that's a lot of king james ism for saying people are gonna go out and find some preacher will tell them what they want to hear so is the case the bible i believe makes it abundantly clear in this passage that
[time=2361] homosexuality is sin there are countless passages that label all kinds of other things as sin
[time=2369] this is no different but it is sin and we live in a time where there's great uncertainty as to
[time=2375] whether it is sin or an alternative lifestyle some will then say
[time=2381] what if homosexuality is organic it's genetic and the homosexual cannot help themselves
[time=2389] it's part of their hereditary matrix a few comments the first and most important
[time=2397] common is this i'm not an expert in this area and i don't want to pretend to be
[time=2403] my words as to the cause and etiology of homosexuality are certainly not the final word
[time=2409] but secondly the final word is not in yet either a great number of studies have been done both
[time=2416] behaviorally and genetically trying to discover the cause and reasons for homosexuality
[time=2423] there is some study that has been done that has linked certain levels of homosexuality to genetics
[time=2432] but there is no concurring opinion among scholars as to any or to what degree genetics and heredity
[time=2441] are a part of the homosexual development secondly if someone is homosexual and we trace it to chemistry and we try to put in
[time=2456] the right hormones if you will into their body it does nothing to change their sexual orientation it just makes them more sexual the evidence i believe is weighted towards homosexuality is a learned behavior
[time=2473] and a behavior that is learned by an individual for whom we should have great sympathy
[time=2479] the majority of people who are homosexual are people who have had a background that has
[time=2489] conditioned them towards that direction now please do not think that i am now condoning it because i am admitting that genetics may have
[time=2498] a small part or that behavior that is learned has a major part behavior that is learned that was
[time=2505] often beyond their control i am not therefore condoning it but i want you to understand it
[time=2512] pages and pages and pages and volumes and volumes and volumes have been written about
[time=2518] what behavioral links there are to development of homosexuality i want to share a few of these
[time=2525] with you to alert you these are some of the predominant things that lead to homosexual
[time=2534] development in the life of a child an absent abusive or poor father relationship
[time=2541] a domineering mother broken family relationships oppressive parents parents who find all of sex unacceptable and never to be spoken of
[time=2564] sexual experimentation in youth that is not necessarily homosexual in its intention and seduction from older men in the case of young boys and in the case of women often a development of a intimate wholesome
[time=2582] relationship that becomes dependent then obsessive and then finally sexual
[time=2593] to say that this is the tip of the iceberg is an exaggeration regardless of its causes the bible and there's an infinitely wise god who stood behind it says
[time=2604] it is sin let's just talk for a moment isn't all of our life and all sin related to both genetics
[time=2613] and learned behavior as children and adults i believe that there's got to be some genetic
[time=2620] relationship between homosexuality and genetics because i believe that about every sin
[time=2627] if you see god created adamandeve with a sin free nature and once they sinned they now had a sinful nature and when they had three or more children
[time=2638] at least cane able and saith cane able and saith not only inherited their physical traits
[time=2644] from adamandeve but they inherited their emotional their mental their willful and their spiritual
[time=2650] traits their children were born as sinners it was inherited it was genetic and each child that
[time=2661] has been born since then father to son mother to son mother to daughter though the whole matrix
[time=2667] sin is being passed on that's why paul said in romans 7 17 sin dwells within me
[time=2673] we do inherit it and secondly we do learn sin along the way
[time=2679] that's not only true of homosexuality that's true of any sin it's true of the sin of greediness
[time=2688] it's true of the sin of pride it's in me it's in my genes that's why i only wear double knits now i don't wear jeans anymore pride is there greediness is there
[time=2700] strife is there sexuality is there in each of us
[time=2707] and we've had some faulty behavioral modeling in all of our lives some to a tragic degree
[time=2715] but there still comes a point in each of our lives with every sin including this one that we make a conscious choice and we choose the bible says it is sin it was a problem in their day just as it is in ours it's not a new sin
[time=2733] it's at least as old as lot and far older we're sure but in the times in which paul lived the greek world held it up as a
[time=2744] positive alternative lifestyle no doubt play-doh and Socrates both engaged in homosexuality
[time=2752] 14 of the first 15 emperors of the roman empire were homosexuals the most notorious for a number
[time=2760] of reasons was niro who first married a young boy by the name of spaurus whom he called his wife
[time=2768] and later in life married a man by the name of pathagoras not the pathagoras of the pathagarium
[time=2774] theorem of euclidean geometry a different pathagoras whom he called my husband
[time=2780] it's not a new problem then or now this simple statement the bible clearly classifies homosexual
[time=2793] acts as sin this statement though is just as important please don't turn out turn off your
[time=2803] selective perception hearing aid the bible says this next i believe while homosexuality is
[time=2811] classified as a sin it is not classified as a special sin in the list where homosexuality is
[time=2821] given in the new testament it has some very familiar neighbors in this passage you'll notice that homosexuality is treated equal with
[time=2830] being greedy slandering swindling someone
[time=2843] paul nor no other writer of the scripture says now these are sins but man this stuff over here is
[time=2852] this is really the low stuff now it's all in one group in roman's chapter one where it says for this reason god gave them up too
[time=2865] and homosexuality follows let me tell you a few other things that follow in that same list
[time=2872] envy strife disobedience to parents proud they're all treated the same in first timothy chapter nine or there's no chapter nine in first timothy in first timothy
[time=2895] chapter one verse nine through eleven homosexuality is again listed but it has these neighbors
[time=2902] those who lie and those who commit perjury now what i'm trying to say is this yes the bible says homosexuality is sin
[time=2914] but it doesn't say it's any different and i'm going to live by this nor is it any worse than any
[time=2921] other sin now what i'm not trying to do is necessarily elevate homosexuality in your eyes i'm trying to get us to see that all sin as is detestable to god as those who we socially say
[time=2933] are more detestable to us what i'm saying is we all live in the same neighborhood and it's called
[time=2939] the bottom of the barrel we are all sinners everyone and that god's love christ death on the cross
[time=2950] was equally as valid and for the homosexual as it is everyone else who has ever sinned
[time=2958] and everyone else has sinned it's not a special class there is no us and them
[time=2964] sometimes in our attempts to denounce the sin we fail to remember that christ died for the homosexual
[time=2975] too and that he or she is to be loved and ministered to just like everyone else
[time=2982] if we today can look at someone who has been rebellious to their parents and say
[time=2989] we love you and we want to help you and we ought to look at the homosexual and say we love you and we want to help you
[time=3000] that doesn't mean that we're in any way condoning it not at all
[time=3006] but we're recognizing that they're one of us someone for whom christ died
[time=3014] thirdly i believe the bible says this that homosexuality is changeable
[time=3024] verse 11 says and such were some of you that's past tense
[time=3031] Paul was saying some of you in Corinth were covetous but christ has changed your life
[time=3039] some of you were adulterers but christ has changed your life some of you were homosexuals
[time=3046] but christ has changed your life homosexuality can be changed there are many many articles that
[time=3054] have been written stating that homosexuality cannot be changed i believe those are coming from the
[time=3061] pens of men and women who are committed to their homosexuality and want to believe that it can't
[time=3067] be changed because they don't want to change it can be changed man by the name of dr mensell
[time=3077] patterson is the chairman of the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at the medical
[time=3084] college of georgia in augusta in an article that i read by him he said that he used to believe that
[time=3091] homosexuality could not be changed but now he says quote there is statistical evidence
[time=3097] to prove that the homosexual can change their sexual orientation and go on to live a fulfilling
[time=3105] heterosexual lifestyle a change can be made the bible has said it science has confirmed it
[time=3115] not that godward needs that confirmation but it does this testimony from a young woman entrapped in homosexuality and to be honest a christian
[time=3130] a few excerpts from a short biography i tried to interpret the scripture so to make my sexual
[time=3137] preference acceptable in god's eyes but the more i studied the bible and tried to approach
[time=3143] it with consistency and integrity the more i realized that its statements on homosexuality
[time=3150] were not just culturally comments they were they expressed will of god for time and eternity
[time=3158] and for my life now i surrendered i said god you know that i'm not willing right now to let you
[time=3167] change my life i'm not even willing to be made willing but there's something weighed down deep
[time=3176] inside of me that says yes to you so lord please take that little bit of yes if you will take it
[time=3185] and do with it as you please it's all i have to give later although i was now much more willing
[time=3194] to be obedient i found that the problems did not get easier to handle there were problems with
[time=3202] lust and sexual fantasies i found that i could relate quite well to the guys
[time=3212] who have told me that they struggled with girls who dressed in modestly now i understand
[time=3219] for we struggle with the same temptation a little later as the years have gone by
[time=3227] god has graciously been at work in my life my thoughts run rampant much less frequently
[time=3234] i have not been sexually involved with another woman for many years
[time=3240] yes i've made mistakes it's been a slow and painful process but the lord has been faithful
[time=3248] and jesus has spoken faithful words of conviction and forgiveness comfort and strength and today
[time=3259] i am in a position of full-time christian ministry a living testimony of the grace of god
[time=3268] beloved homosexuality can be changed in my layman's opinion underlying that layman's opinion
[time=3276] it is a learned behavior for the most part that becomes an obsessive behavior
[time=3283] an addictive behavior and the change from that will almost never be the flick of a light switch
[time=3289] analogous might be alcoholism which has some emotional and mental along with physical addictions
[time=3298] both can be overcome by god's grace these four humble suggestions to those of you who are struggling today with homosexuality
[time=3311] and i did say those of you because there are some here in a crowd this size who have struggled i
[time=3319] may not know one but believers struggle with it believers struggle with it these four suggestions
[time=3331] one recognize that homosexual acts our sin confess them and find forgiveness
[time=3341] never till we admit what we're doing is sin do we find forgiveness and release that has to be the
[time=3347] starting place two commit yourself to refrain from continuing to sin
[time=3354] it'll be a struggle this young woman gave that testimony just like everyone else who has been
[time=3360] addicted to a lifestyle of any sin it'll be an agonizing struggle but fight the good fight three become involved with a professional christian counselor who can guide you through this maze
[time=3375] for remain active in the body of christ for strength and love and support
[time=3381] and that leads me to the fourth major statement i believe the bible says is this
[time=3387] that homosexuality is totally forgivable totally he says in such words some of you but you have been
[time=3395] washed you didn't say you've been touched up but there's still wringer on the collar
[time=3403] he said you've been washed you've been sanctified you've been set apart as belonging to god
[time=3409] you've been justified just as i had some suggestions to those who struggle with homosexuality i have
[time=3416] some suggestions for this church for every church one recognize that homosexuality is a
[time=3424] forgivable sin to love and accept and minister to homosexuals
[time=3433] don't reject him don't push him outside of god's grace don't say well maybe god can forgive you
[time=3439] but please find it on another corner an excellent article in christianity today was entitled
[time=3448] homosexuals can change subtitle and when they do it's almost never with the health of christians
[time=3456] we tend to push him away because we misunderstand them we misunderstand that god loves them and god
[time=3465] forgives them when christian wrote this struggling testimony i was dying for someone to talk to
[time=3473] not someone who would condone but not someone who would always be condemning someone to talk with
[time=3481] the support me to encourage me to fight the good fight but i thought it always alone always alone
[time=3491] god forgives he'll forgive you will you be forgiven
[time=3503] you've been listening to the special music from our special guests the sound investment from
