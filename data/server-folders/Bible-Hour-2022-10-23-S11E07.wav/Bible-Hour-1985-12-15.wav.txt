[time=120] Good morning, and welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=124] [MUSIC - 349 seconds]
[time=474] We look forward now to the ministry of the Concert Choir as they sing for us again.
[time=486] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=597] [APPLAUSE]
[time=602] We want to thank you again for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=607] We've been talking for the last several weeks about the living Christmas tree, and today Pete and I are standing on the set.
[time=613] Yes, we've already completed five concerts, Rick, and two of the highlights is the premier concert with the Black Hawk Christian School and then the Super '60s concert yesterday afternoon.
[time=623] That was a great time, and we've had a good time in the first five concerts.
[time=627] You know, Pete, during the Super '60s concert, I meet, and I'm sure you do literally hundreds of people who tell us they watch the Bible Hour.
[time=635] Thank you so much for your encouragement.
[time=637] It's really our joy to share with you the ministry of the Bible Hour along with the living Christmas tree.
[time=643] I wish that we could say to all of you who are watching to come by and we could give you tickets.
[time=648] Unfortunately, we cannot give out any more tickets to the living Christmas tree.
[time=652] They're already gone, but we do have something special we can invite you to.
[time=656] Yes, Rick, we have a television special coming up.
[time=659] It will reflect many of the events that take place in the living Christmas tree.
[time=663] That special program will be aired on WPTA Channel 21, December 24th at 8.30,
[time=670] and then on December 25th at 11.30.
[time=673] It will be an exciting time for us.
[time=675] We're going to be recording it in just a couple days and you can get a real view of the tree and what happens night after night here.
[time=683] Right now, we've taken just a few moments away from our morning worship service to take this time with you.
[time=689] Actually, it's pretty early on Sunday morning and we've recorded this so that we could talk directly with you, our friends who join us for television, while we're making announcements here in our church.
[time=699] In particular, the thing that we wanted to share with you along with the television special is an excellent booklet by the name of the tyranny of the urgent.
[time=709] Christmas is such a busy and hectic time.
[time=712] It produces a great deal of strain on all of us.
[time=715] There are urgent things that take place. Christmas waits for no one.
[time=719] But life is often like that.
[time=721] Whether it's Christmas or not, many of us are caught in a trap in a cycle where what we want to do is always squeezed out by the things that seem so urgent.
[time=730] Well, this booklet gives us some excellent priorities in life.
[time=734] How we can get ahead of the game and do the most important things first.
[time=739] Again, the title is "The Tyranny of the Urgent" and we'd love to send you a copy
[time=745] if you would write to us today.
[time=747] Please write and we'll send you a complimentary copy.
[time=750] Let it be our Christmas gift from us to you.
[time=754] You can receive a copy by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=763] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=770] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour and as we go back to the Morning Worship Service, we trust that the Ministry of Music and of God's Word will be a special encouragement to you and will make your Christmas more Christ-filled and, of course, more merry.
[time=793] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=983] Would you pray with me, our God and our Father, we thank you for the gentleness of the stringed instruments that remind us of the gentleness of your son.
[time=995] Father, today we've come to this place to celebrate, but also to find in you comfort.
[time=1004] As we've heard on violin and viola in a piano,
[time=1010] we've heard the gentleness of your tender care.
[time=1014] Father, we've come today to lean on you.
[time=1018] Father, today have come from a busy world that demands more than they have to give.
[time=1025] It seems that the pressures of life can never be satisfied.
[time=1029] Father, today we pray for businessmen who struggle with intense pressure.
[time=1034] You would give them some relief from the tyranny of the urgent.
[time=1038] You would teach them to order their days wisely, and then in those times of pressure, and they find you giving extra grace and strength.
[time=1047] Today we pray for mothers who find themselves chasing children all day, never catching them till it's late at night.
[time=1055] God refreshed them through your word daily, we pray.
[time=1060] Father, for those who are physically suffering, we pray that your gentle hand would be upon them, particularly for Marv Islin and Bill Vanderfort, as they fought chronic and reoccurring illnesses that are so concerning.
[time=1076] God, we pray that you would give healing to their bodies.
[time=1080] We pray that you'll strengthen their spirits as well.
[time=1084] Father, today we pray for Fran Haynes and Hazel Huber and others who are recovering from surgery that you would bring their recovery about quickly.
[time=1094] We pray for those whose children are ill.
[time=1099] The great hurt that comes to a mother and a father when their children are not well.
[time=1105] We pray for the stewards in the marklies.
[time=1108] Father, today we pray for those who are homebound, some bedbound.
[time=1114] The grip of loneliness and the days that seemingly don't have design.
[time=1120] God, would you give their heart a song that comes from you in a confidence and a joy in life, even with its limitations?
[time=1127] May we as a body be caring and tender and supporting of those who are homebound.
[time=1133] We pray for families who are caring for loved ones in that condition, for the woods, the Martins and others.
[time=1141] God, today, most of all, we pray spiritually that we would be strengthened in our faith, that there would be a desire in our heart to worship you, that we might come as faithful people, to declare our love for you.
[time=1155] So today, God, we have come to worship you and we ask that as we worship, you would rejuvenate our souls, and let them come alive with praises.
[time=1165] Strengthen our faith, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1169] [AMEN]
[time=1192] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1384] [APPLAUSE - 6 seconds]
[time=1401] That was Dave and Debbie Johnson playing on the violin and the viola and Paul Turner on the piano.
[time=1407] Isn't it amazing how God can take music and ordain it to bring praise and glory and honor to His name?
[time=1414] There's only one thing that brings more glory to God than music, and that's a life given to the Lord Jesus.
[time=1419] Don't forget the message of that song. Oh, come, all ye faithful.
[time=1424] It is our responsibility to come and to bring glory and honor to the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1432] A young Hebrew student was given a copy of the New Testament. He read it and then took it to his rabbi and asked him.
[time=1439] He said, "Rabbi, I know that we do not believe that this Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah.
[time=1445] But, sir, if the Messiah did come, how would his life be different than that of this Jesus?"
[time=1452] Rabbi had no answer. Jesus Christ is the Messiah, and He has come.
[time=1459] And now it is our privilege to come to Him. Oh, come, all ye faithful.
[time=1465] Open your Bibles and study with us this morning, please. Out of the gospel, according to Luke in the second chapter,
[time=1471] as Luke gives to us in his crisp historical narrative of the birth of Christ.
[time=1480] Luke chapter 2 is probably the most read and most quoted of all of the gospel narratives.
[time=1487] It occurs in nearly every Christmas pageant, including the 1985 living Christmas tree.
[time=1494] If you bend to the tree, this will sound just a little familiar. Luke chapter 2 and verse 1.
[time=1502] And at that time, it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
[time=1514] And this taxation was made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria, and all went to be taxed everyone to his own city.
[time=1524] And Joseph also went up out of Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, into the city of David, which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and the lineage of David.
[time=1542] To be registered with Mary, his espoused wife being great with child.
[time=1551] And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
[time=1560] And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end.
[time=1574] This particular and very, very familiar part of the Christmas narrative comes to us by the inspiration of God and through the person of Dr. Luke.
[time=1584] Dr. Luke was a Greek. He grew up and was educated amongst the intelligence of his day. He was a medical doctor.
[time=1594] Please do not think that medicine was something primitive in that day.
[time=1599] The documents show that they had a great deal of insight into human anatomy and physiology.
[time=1606] They also understood chemistry quite well and they had a number of prescriptions of chemical drugs that they had manufactured that were proven and were effective.
[time=1617] These people were wise. As a matter of fact, long before the birth of Christ, the Greeks had a theory that they called the theory of the atom.
[time=1627] You thought that was something that we found in our lifetime, but the Greeks held to a theory of atomic molecular structure.
[time=1635] They did not understand it. They had no telescopes, but they began to see that everything was made of particles, and they called those particles atoms, and we borrowed the word from them.
[time=1646] Luke is an educated doctor. That's important to understand because this man writes trying to communicate the message of Christ to those who would look at it with a skeptical academic eye.
[time=1663] And so he begins with history, my favorite, and he gives to us some historical data. It is important history.
[time=1674] History may not be relevant to us at its first pass, but this history is crucial.
[time=1680] It tells us of the timing of the birth of Christ. It says there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus.
[time=1688] Who is Caesar Augustus? Well, the word Caesar is simply the Latin name for an emperor or a king.
[time=1697] It comes into a number of languages through a transliteration. If you've been a student of Russian history, you remember the days of the Russian Tsars.
[time=1706] That is simply Russian Tsar for the Latin Caesar. You remember history of the German rise to power under Kaiser Wilhelm? Kaiser is simply German for the word Caesar.
[time=1722] This Caesar was the king of the Roman Empire, and in that day they knew nothing of anything that was outside of the Roman Empire worth going to take.
[time=1734] They considered the Caesar not only the king of Rome and its empire, but literally the king of the world, and they deified him and held him up as though he was a god.
[time=1746] Later Caesars took the name Pontophus Maximus, which means the highest priest, that he was an intermediary between man and the gods.
[time=1756] This particular Caesar is called Caesar Augustus. His name is actually Octavian. Octavian is a distant relative of the more familiar Julius Caesar.
[time=1770] On the Ides of March, beware of the Ides of March. On the Ides of March in 44 BC, Julius Caesar was put to death by a conspiracy. At two, Brutae, you also Brutus.
[time=1784] And that conspiracy launched a time of internal strife and literal civil war between vying powers for dominance of the Roman Empire.
[time=1795] And for 14 years, no one emerged who was capable of taking the power of Rome in his hands. But at the Battle of Octium in 30 BC, there arose one man, Victor, his name Octavian.
[time=1811] And he took for himself the name Caesar, but it was thought that the name Caesar was not enough to distinguish this young and capable ruler of the Roman Empire.
[time=1824] So the Senate met, and they conferred a second name on this Caesar. They called him Caesar the August one. He is called Caesar Augustus.
[time=1835] But that name cannot be overemphasized. It was saying this man is the world's first citizen. They had gathered together every possible name to say that this man was above every other man and they called him Caesar Augustus.
[time=1853] And when he sent out a decree, the world would respond. There's a second description that is given historically that this was not only the times when Caesar Augustus ruled the world, but that a governor was in position in Syria by the name in the King James Quirinius.
[time=1874] He's often, and more familiarly known as Cyrenius. There have been those who have been skeptical saying, "See, Luke didn't know his history. This land was not Syria. This land was Palestine." And the people of the nation of Israel would never allow themselves to be called by the name Syria.
[time=1893] That spoke of the Assyrians, their enemies. You need to remember something. You need to remember that Luke was not a Hebrew. He was a Greek, and to the Greeks this was Syria.
[time=1907] For you see, long before the days of the Caesars, the Greeks ruled the world, and their greatest hero was Alexander the Great. But Alexander had no successor, so when he died in a youthful premature age, his kingdom was divided into fourths.
[time=1924] To the far south was the kingdom of Egypt. Just above that, enveloping all of Palestine and ancient Babylon and Assyria was what the Greeks called Syria. And there was a governor over that geographical region, his name Cyrenius.
[time=1942] And so Luke is trying to give us a chronological time frame. He begins by describing the emperor of the world Caesar Augustus, but that spanned over 35 years. But then he narrows it down even further.
[time=1957] And during the time in a narrower region of geography, when Cyrenius was governor, and then this statement, there went out a decree that all the world should be taxed.
[time=1972] You see, it isn't 20th century Americans who were the first time who struggled to balance their national budget. Rome had a deficit, but they weren't nearly as tax conscious as we are.
[time=1986] And so whenever they were short funds, or they wanted to expand the empire or engage in a new campaign, they simply raised the taxes in one particular region or another.
[time=1997] But this was a unique taxation. This was not a taxation of a newly acquired territory to the Roman Empire.
[time=2006] This was a worldwide tax. There wanted a decree out from Caesar Augustus that all of the world should be taxed.
[time=2019] Well that created some logistical problems. Even the IRS can't nail us all down at once, so they can only audit a few of us. The Romans had the same problem.
[time=2030] Why, if they tried to tax a particular region, it was amazing how many people took a vacation at the time the Roman tax officers showed up.
[time=2039] So what Caesar's plan was this. He would issue a decree that the whole world should be taxed, and every man had to go to his home city to pay that tax.
[time=2051] That assured him that you didn't leave town when his tax officer came. It was a way of taking a census of gaining control over the population to tax them.
[time=2062] Why, that's all history. But that history then blends together as the fulfillment of prophecy.
[time=2071] For you see, Joseph is engaged, we would say, to Mary. Mary is with child, and they're living in a northern military town of Nazareth in a land called Galilee that creates a dilemma.
[time=2096] For you see, Micah the prophet said, prophetically, over 400 years before the birth of Christ, that the Messiah would be born in the city of David Bethlehem.
[time=2111] Now we have the Messiah by miracle of the virgin birth incarnate in Mary except for Mary's in the wrong place.
[time=2121] Now the dilemma is further compounded. Mary is ready to give birth to her baby, and Nazareth and Bethlehem are 90 miles apart as the hawk flies.
[time=2137] But the problem is you can't go the way the hawk flies, or the crow flies.
[time=2142] For you see, there were two problems, the first geopolitical and the second geographical.
[time=2148] Nestled between Galilee and Judea is a land called Samaria, and for the most part it would be a rare exception that a Jew would take a journey through Samaria.
[time=2162] That's why the gospels punctuate with a mark of explanation and astonishment that Jesus needs to be passed through Samaria, because you just didn't do that.
[time=2174] Those were the other guys. And so the journey would have to be lengthened because of the geopolitical fairs.
[time=2187] But even if that wasn't Samaria, the problem is that if you draw a straight line between Nazareth and Bethlehem, you will find that it is almost all entirely rugged mountains.
[time=2203] So it was necessary for them to go down from Nazareth relatively high to the valley of the Jordan River to follow the trade routes along the Jordan River to probably Jericho.
[time=2218] We don't know that, but probably Jericho, and then to start a treacherous climb back up the mountains that comes to Jerusalem and then from Jerusalem to the town of Bethlehem.
[time=2229] I have not yet met a pregnant woman, eight and a half or nine months term, who looked forward to that journey on foot.
[time=2239] And I haven't found any who thought the idea of a camel ride was much better.
[time=2245] Someone said to me, "Jesus came prematurely after that journey."
[time=2251] So now the dilemma is this. Jesus is in the right place. He's in Mary's womb. The problem marries in the wrong place. She's supposed to be in Bethlehem.
[time=2265] So God puts it in the mind of Caesar Augustus to make a simple decree, a decree that was really the decree of God to rearrange history to fulfill prophecy.
[time=2282] This is all history. Why would I spend 12 minutes unfolding history for you? Well, first of all, I have over 60 hours of history and I have to share it at some time.
[time=2297] When you suffer those things through college, you have to find an audience somewhere. No, that's really not it. It's because this history has two very, very practical, precious lessons for us to grab hold of.
[time=2315] The first is this. Prophecy is the birthmark of the Messiah. Remember that, would you please? Prophecy is the birthmark of the Messiah.
[time=2330] God had planned an eternity pass that he would enter the universe in what we call time and space, physically as a human being. He wasn't simply going to be the transcendent God who transcended both time and space, but that he would actually enter time.
[time=2349] Bethlehem, the time when Caesar Augustus reign and Cyrenius was governor. That's time and space. Where would he enter in Jerusalem? No. In Nazareth, no. In Rome, no, but in Bethlehem.
[time=2368] You see, God had given prophecy so that we would have a birthmark of the Messiah. This statement about Bethlehem is only one of over 300 prophecies concerning the Messiah that Jesus Christ fulfilled.
[time=2386] Now why did God give those prophetic statements? I believe he gave us those prophetic statements for at least these two reasons. One, so that we would know that the Bible is his word because of its miraculous content, proven by fulfilled prophecy, and two, and more importantly, so that we wouldn't miss his son when he entered the universe.
[time=2411] So God gave prophecy, 300 or more in number, to identify who Jesus would be. Prophecies like he would come of the line of David. Prophecies like he would be of the tribe of Judah. Prophecies like he would be born in Bethlehem. Prophecies like his hands and feet would be pierced along with his sides.
[time=2434] Over 300 of those prophetic statements help us to pinpoint with certainty that Jesus is the Messiah.
[time=2444] Flip back in your Bibles with me, if you will, to the Old Testament book of Isaiah. And Isaiah tells us the very purpose of prophecy.
[time=2456] Isaiah was one of the earliest prophets in the prophetic scheme of giving to us the nature of the Messiah.
[time=2467] And in Isaiah, chapter 48, we find the very purpose for prophecy. Why did God give prophecy? Isaiah gives us the clue in Isaiah, chapter 48, and verses 3, 4, and 5.
[time=2484] It reads like this, "I have declared the former things from the beginning." That's prophecy. He says, "The things that you already know about, I've declared them before all that from the beginning.
[time=2498] And they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them, and I did them suddenly, and they came to pass." Verse 5.
[time=2509] "I have even from the beginning declared it to thee. Before it came to pass, I showed it to thee, lest thou shouldest say, my idol hath done them.
[time=2522] And my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them." You see, God says, "I'm telling you things before they happen, so when they happen, you won't say, 'Why, that's coincidence.'" Isn't that an amazing set of circumstance?
[time=2541] My gods have done it. The God that we worship today is the world of a closed scientific system.
[time=2547] God said, "No, I'm going to tell you things prophetically so you'll know that it's me that speaks." Prophecy is the birthmark of the Messiah.
[time=2555] God wanted us to know that this was his son that was entering the world.
[time=2561] There are those that object to prophecy and say, "That's really not miraculous." And there are those who object to prophecy, and they say that Jesus simply manipulated the circumstances so that he could fulfill the prophecies.
[time=2575] Let's hypothetically accept that for just a moment.
[time=2579] Let's suppose that Jesus hypothetically manipulated the circumstances so as to fulfill prophecy.
[time=2587] Let me ask you this question. How many of you chose your grandparents?
[time=2592] Did any of you choose your ancestors back? Let's say 42 generations?
[time=2598] I didn't. I doubt that any of you did. How did Jesus manipulate his ancestry?
[time=2605] The prophet said he would be of the line of David of the tribe of Judah, a seat of Abraham. How did he do that?
[time=2613] How many of you chose where you were going to be born?
[time=2617] Your mother walked into the hospital and said, "Not this crummy place. I want to go somewhere else to be born.
[time=2623] This is low class." Beloved, you came when you came. You may have had something to do with the timing, but you had nothing to do with the place.
[time=2635] Jesus didn't say, "Hey, Mom, Bethlehem, get out of here." He couldn't manipulate that.
[time=2642] Well, then there are those that say, "Well, Mary, Joseph, and the disciples, they manipulated all that." Well, let's take some other examples. I don't believe that there's any logical basis to assume that Jesus said to the Romans.
[time=2656] Excuse me. Just before you crucify me, I would prefer if you would nail me to the cross instead of tying me.
[time=2663] For you see, back a thousand years ago, my great-great ancestor, David, said my hands and feet would be pierced.
[time=2670] And that's the only way I know to fulfill this, so you boys go ahead and nail me here.
[time=2675] And then after he was dead, how did he communicate to a Roman that they were supposed to pierce him in the side?
[time=2682] And how was he to manipulate Judas into betraying him for 30 pieces of silver?
[time=2687] Then after Jesus' dead, manipulate Judas into throwing the 30 pieces of silver into the temple out of guilt.
[time=2694] And how did he manipulate the religious leaders of that day who didn't want to fulfill prophecy to take the 30 pieces of silver and buy a potter's field?
[time=2704] It doesn't work.
[time=2708] Well, there are others who usually have not studied history who want to say, well, what we have here is we have a dating problem.
[time=2716] You see, we know that Luke wrote after the death of Christ, but probably these Old Testament books were written about that same time.
[time=2727] Well, you don't have to be a great scholar of archeology, you just simply need to do a little homework and you'll discover that there is more than ample conclusive evidence that the Old Testament was complete hundreds of years before the birth of Christ, hundreds of years.
[time=2747] One of the most classic examples of proof is that, is in the year 250 BC, the Greeks drafted what they called the Septuagint.
[time=2759] Now, the Septuagint is nothing more than a translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew to Greek.
[time=2765] But you don't have to have a degree in logic to be able to deduce that for you to have a translation, you must have to hold an original from which that translation was made.
[time=2778] And if there is a Septuagint in 250 BC, there had to be an Old Testament prior to 250 BC.
[time=2787] You see, hundreds of years before Christ was ever born, these specific prophecies were given as a birthmark, and I emphasize the word hundreds of years.
[time=2798] Because you see, the greater the time between the prophetic statement and its fulfillment, the more significant the prophecies.
[time=2807] That's why supposed modern-day prophets bear no credence.
[time=2812] Let me pretend that I possess some rare prophetic abilities.
[time=2816] I'm going to make a prediction.
[time=2818] I'm going to predict that in 1986, it's coming to me now, just give me a moment here.
[time=2826] In 1986, in the 4th congressional district, Dan Coates will be elected congressman.
[time=2835] Well, that's certainly future.
[time=2838] But you know, there's an awful lot I knew there.
[time=2841] I knew that 1986 was a congressional election year.
[time=2846] I also knew that Dan Coates was the present congressman from the 4th congressional district.
[time=2852] Now, I haven't talked to our congressman, I don't know that he's running or not running.
[time=2856] I hope that he is, but I don't know that.
[time=2859] But you see, that's very simple to predict.
[time=2862] Now, if I stretch that out and do something 10 years, if I say in 1996,
[time=2869] I predict that Peter Kobe will run for congressman.
[time=2873] Well, that's a little different.
[time=2875] Now, I still know that 19 -- no campaign speeches now, please.
[time=2880] But I do know that 1996 is an election year.
[time=2885] And I do know there is a critter by the name of Peter Kobe in the 4th district, but that would be something a little bit more spectacular.
[time=2892] Now, let's just take it a little bit further.
[time=2894] I suppose that I predicted that in the year 2076,
[time=2900] and I identified who would be the president of the United States and identified what hometown he would come from and identified his great-great-grandfather, that would be something very impressive.
[time=2915] You wouldn't be impressed because you won't be here.
[time=2919] But if that was recorded, those people would be impressed.
[time=2923] You see, it's the time element that maximizes the power of prophecy.
[time=2929] And hundreds of years before Christ was ever born, the prophets spoke and Jesus fulfilled over 300 of those prophecies.
[time=2942] The simple, practical lesson of this text is this -- prophecy is God's birthmark.
[time=2953] A man by the name of Dr. Peter Stoner, writing for Moody Bible Institute,
[time=2959] has done this work in his book, Science Speaks.
[time=2963] He took eight prophecies concerning the life of Christ.
[time=2967] Let me give those eight to you very quickly.
[time=2969] That he would be born in Bethlehem, Micah chapter 5 verse 2.
[time=2973] That he would be preceded by a messenger, Malachi 3-1.
[time=2977] That he would enter Jerusalem on a donkey.
[time=2982] That he would be betrayed by a friend.
[time=2985] That he would be betrayed by a friend for 30 pieces of silver.
[time=2990] That the money would be thrown on the temple floor and used to buy a potter's field.
[time=2996] That this same Jesus would be silent before his accusers.
[time=3001] And finally, that Jesus would be crucified between two thieves.
[time=3008] Well, Dr. Stoner then took the laws of probability and mathematics and said, "What is the probability of Jesus fulfilling each of these individual prophecies?" And he had a group of people do that, so it wasn't just his opinion.
[time=3022] And then each of the probabilities were multiplied together.
[time=3025] And here's the statistical conclusion.
[time=3028] For Jesus to by chance to fill just those eight prophecies, not all 300, just those eight,
[time=3035] the odds of that happening are one in one times ten to the 17th power.
[time=3046] How many is that?
[time=3047] Well, that is one times ten with seventeen more zeroes after it.
[time=3054] And I know that a million is superseded by a billion, is superseded by a trillion,
[time=3060] and you're not even close to the number yet.
[time=3064] Dr. Stoner gives this illustration of the statistical odds of Jesus fulfilling those prophecies by chance.
[time=3072] If you took silver dollars and to come up with enough silver dollars for that formula,
[time=3080] one times ten to the 17th power, you would have to take those silver dollars, spread them out across the state of Texas, and it would cover the state of Texas from border to border two feet deep.
[time=3093] That's ten to the 17th power.
[time=3096] Now, for Jesus to have fulfilled that by chance, what you would have to do is take one silver dollar and mark it.
[time=3103] Throw it into the state of Texas and mix it all up really good, blindfold a man, and send him into the state of Texas and say you can walk anywhere you want, go as short or as far as you like, but you may only pick up one silver dollar, and that has to be the one we've just marked.
[time=3119] That's the statistical odds of Jesus having fulfilled this prophecy by chance.
[time=3127] Prophecy is God's birthmark.
[time=3131] God wanted us to know that he was sending a son in the world and he didn't want us to miss it,
[time=3137] so he gave us prophecy so that we would be able to identify his son.
[time=3144] God wanted you to see Jesus. He wanted you to know that he came to this world, that he entered time and space, that he might die for your sins and for mine.
[time=3155] That's the practical lesson of all this history, but yet there's one more.
[time=3160] The apostle Paul said God works all things after the counsel of his own will.
[time=3167] Do you know what this gospel narrative of Luke tells me? It tells me this, that God controls history.
[time=3177] You see, we have a sharp contrast. On the one hand we have Caesar the August 1,
[time=3185] Emperor of the World, and over here we've got an obscure Hebrew woman,
[time=3193] pregnant. In a town, Nazareth, didn't he make the Roman maps?
[time=3202] But God, who stands above and through all of history, put it in the mind of Caesar Augustus to make a decree.
[time=3213] Caesar said, "Well, I'll just send out a worldwide taxation." And his men said, "Why, Caesar, that's a brilliant thought." That was inspired and they were right.
[time=3222] It was inspired, but not by Caesar Augustus, but by God, who wanted to intervene in history and arrange the world so as to bring it to the fulfillment of prophecy.
[time=3235] God controls history.
[time=3238] There are some exciting stories in the Bible like this one of God controlling history.
[time=3244] King Ahab was less than a noble king in Israel.
[time=3248] God had warned him by prophets how he should act, but he didn't like the word of the prophets, so Ahab found his own cronies, made them prophets.
[time=3256] They said, "Well, Ahab wanted to hear," and he said, "My, you're a fine prophet." The prophets that he wanted to hear said, "Attack!
[time=3264] Go to Raymuth Gilead attack, you'll surely win." So they go to Raymuth Gilead and they attack. God said, "Don't attack, you'll die." They attack.
[time=3277] Ahab says, as king of Israel to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, "I want to go up to the front lines." So you put on my robes and I'll disguise myself and I'll go up to the front lines.
[time=3290] He puts on the armor of a common soldier and he heads up to the front line, and then in 1 Kings 22 verse 34 there is these words.
[time=3299] "And a certain soldier on a venture shot an arrow." Now here, a field away, maybe some woods in between them, there's two buck private standing out in the field saying, "Look at this cheap government issue stuff." This bow and arrow can't shoot, and he just shoots an arrow on a venture at a chance,
[time=3318] and that arrow flies and hits King Ahab between the links of his armor.
[time=3327] There's a god in heaven who brings his word to fulfillment.
[time=3331] He controls history.
[time=3335] In the book of Esther, an evil man by the name of Haman is plotting the extinction of the Jews,
[time=3344] and he connives a plan and Xerxes passes it.
[time=3349] Mordecai is going to be put to death tomorrow.
[time=3353] If King goes to bed, it's just a typical night, but he can't sleep.
[time=3359] Insomnia strikes him.
[time=3362] There's one certain way to cure insomnia, and that is to go to the library and to pull out the historical documents,
[time=3370] the annuals of the kings, and he began to read.
[time=3375] Much to his disappointment, it didn't put him asleep, and he came across a story of a man who had done a favor for the king,
[time=3381] and realized in the records this man had never been rewarded.
[time=3384] So in the middle of the night, he gets up and says, "Who's this man's family that we can reward them?" They said, "Why, it's Mordecai who we're going to put to death tomorrow." And he says, "Oh, no, we're not, but I'm glad Haman built those gallows.
[time=3397] Let him swing from it." There's a god that controls history.
[time=3404] In World War II, the German Panzer Division had driven the Allied forces of England and Belgium,
[time=3410] back to the shores of Dunkirk, France.
[time=3413] They were ready to march and drive them into the sea, but the head of the German Air Force pleaded with Hitler
[time=3420] to let the planes bomb them into submission, and Hitler agreed the next morning the planes would take off,
[time=3427] but the next morning fog rolled in and the planes couldn't get off the ground.
[time=3432] Churchill called a nation to prayer, and a nation prayed, and fog came in.
[time=3437] In England rallied.
[time=3440] Gunboats, destroyers, vacation yachts, motorboats, and rowboats launched from England
[time=3448] across the English Channel, and 350,000 men were saved in rowboats and in yachts,
[time=3456] because there's a god that controls history.
[time=3460] Beloved Caesar Augustus was not the king in the story, he was the pawn of God,
[time=3467] manipulated as emperor to fulfill prophecy because God is in control of history.
[time=3477] But he's also in control of your life and life.
[time=3480] He says he knows the hairs that cover your head.
[time=3483] He says that he knows the thoughts and the intention of our hearts, and that he loves us and that he sent Jesus Christ his son to die for our sins.
[time=3492] Oh, would you believe on him?
[time=3494] Would you trust him today and receive him as Savior?
[time=3497] Would you open up your heart to the God of history and his son, whose birthmark was prophecy, and receive him as Savior?
[time=3506] I pray that you will.
[time=3516] You've been listening to the music from the Blackhawk Christian School Concert Choir and the message from the word of God from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3524] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3532] Will you pray this prayer with me?
[time=3534] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3541] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3546] I ask you to come in today.
[time=3548] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3552] If you prayed that prayer, will you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3557] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
