[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=120] (bell chimes) Good morning and welcome to The Bible Hour.
[time=128] Now live from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=134] it's the Bible Hour.
[time=136] With inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=145] Join us, won't you, for The Bible Hour.
[time=149] (singing in foreign language)
[time=179] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=197] We welcome you to our morning service.
[time=201] We're so glad that you're here, especially on this particular day when we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=209] I also want to welcome those that are joining us by The Bible Hour.
[time=213] It was a privilege through the last week at the Living Christmas Tree to meet many people who view us.
[time=219] Often they say we go to an early service in our church and that we hurry home to worship with you at Black Hawk.
[time=225] We're glad that we have the opportunity to share our morning worship service with people in our community.
[time=231] Our special music is from the team choir this morning.
[time=234] They're going to sing for us right now.
[time=236] We appreciate the ministry of Amy and John Such in the youth department and then that of Rick Halls, who is the music director for the teens.
[time=244] Let's listen to them now as they sing for us.
[time=249] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=471] (audience applauds)
[time=479] - The heavens sing hallelujah.
[time=485] We sing hallelujah to the newborn king.
[time=487] Let's continue our music singing hymn number 107.
[time=491] Angels, we have heard on high.
[time=493] Gloria, in each shall see's day all, 107.
[time=497] [MUSIC - 19 seconds]
[time=519] (audience applauds)
[time=549] [MUSIC - 91 seconds]
[time=645] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=648] Some of the evenings have been a bit short in recent days because of the living Christmas tree and all those things that have to be cared for.
[time=655] Waking up this morning and seeing just a little bit of snow covering the ground,
[time=661] covering over some of the snow that had been blackened because of mud and slush, reminded me of the song that Brian Losin is singing for us right now.
[time=670] It's amazing how that fluffy snow covers a multitude of sins.
[time=674] And so that's true with Jesus' blood, as he covered us and made us white as snow.
[time=679] Now, let's listen now as Brian Losin sings of this theme.
[time=683] [MUSIC] I once read in a poem [MUSIC] When snow covers the earth [MUSIC] That it hides the world's cars and gives nature new birth [MUSIC] And they say when a man turns from sin to the Lord [MUSIC] That forgiveness like snow covers him evermore [MUSIC] And somewhere it's always [MUSIC] See the soft drifting down [MUSIC] As the snowflakes surrender [MUSIC] To the heartening ground [MUSIC] Like the good grace of Jesus [MUSIC] That now covers our sins [MUSIC] In the kingdom of heaven [MUSIC] It's slowing again [MUSIC]
[time=787] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=933] (audience applauding) Again, we want to welcome you and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=944] We're standing in front of the Living Christmas Tree, and I've asked the Siglands and the Colby families to join us today so that you can have the privilege of meeting the people who are behind the people.
[time=955] Now, I have to confess to you, being on television is not their favorite thing to do, but they've consented to be here because we wanted you to have the privilege of meeting these families who are so committed to the Lord and serving them here.
[time=967] Of course, you know Pete Coby, good morning.
[time=969] Thank you for dragging your family here.
[time=971] That took some effort.
[time=972] And this is Andy.
[time=973] Andy, what grade are you in?
[time=975] Fifth.
[time=976] Fifth grade in what school?
[time=977] Life at Christian School.
[time=978] Thank you.
[time=979] We need a little commercial in there, Andy.
[time=981] And this is Carol.
[time=982] Pete's lovely wife.
[time=983] Good morning, Carol.
[time=984] Hi.
[time=985] We're glad that you're here.
[time=986] Thanks for being willing to get up.
[time=988] Lisa is home from college.
[time=989] Lisa, tell us a little bit about your school.
[time=991] Well, I'm a senior at Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=995] And it's not nearly as cold there as it is here.
[time=998] Well, welcome back to the cold.
[time=999] It's fun to come for a few weeks, isn't it?
[time=1001] And this is Peter, Peter Jr., who I often, on the phone, misunderstand his voice and think he's his father.
[time=1007] Peter, what grade are you in?
[time=1008] An 11th grade?
[time=1009] Black or Christian?
[time=1011] Thank you, Coby, for coming this morning.
[time=1013] This family is a joy to be around because each of them has made a personal commitment to Christ and they're serving him and we love them as our own family.
[time=1022] This is the Siggland family.
[time=1023] You may not be as familiar with the Sigglands because they spend most of their time on the other side of the camera.
[time=1028] Dale is the producer and director of the Bible Hour.
[time=1031] And occasionally, Steve, when he's home is a cameraman.
[time=1034] This is Mark.
[time=1035] Mark, how old are you now?
[time=1036] I'm 16.
[time=1037] Did anything special happened to you in the last week or two?
[time=1040] Got my license.
[time=1041] So you may want to stay off the roads now, Mark's a driver.
[time=1044] This is Sarah, and I won't ask Sarah how old she is because she looks much more mature than her age.
[time=1049] Sarah, we are thankful for the fine job you do babysitting occasionally.
[time=1053] Thank you.
[time=1055] Thanks.
[time=1056] This is Mary Kay, who least of all likes being on television, but as big as her smile is, we're glad you're here.
[time=1062] Mary Kay, thanks for the generous spirit you have in sharing your husband with all of us.
[time=1067] This is Dale Siggland, who is here every time that the Bible Hour is broadcast.
[time=1072] You may not see him, but he's the one that really makes it all happen.
[time=1075] And Steve is home from school.
[time=1077] Tell us a little bit about your school.
[time=1079] I go to Purdue University.
[time=1080] I'm major in engineering.
[time=1081] And he's an excellent cameraman when we get him to come home.
[time=1085] Well, these are the Siggland's and the Colby's, and we are certainly proud as a family, the Hawks's, that is, to be serving the Lord here with them.
[time=1093] Before we go back to the live part of our morning worship service, today I want to encourage you to write to us for a helpful little book that's called The Tyranny of the Urgent.
[time=1102] Between the Siggland's helping to produce the TV special and the Colby's being a part of the living Christmas tree, all of us here know a little bit about the Tyranny of the Urgent.
[time=1111] And there's a whole set of cameramen, technicians, sound person now who are nodding their heads in agreement.
[time=1117] This is a very busy time.
[time=1119] But it seems all of our lives are full of busyness.
[time=1122] And so this helpful little booklet is something we want to share with you.
[time=1126] It's entitled The Tyranny of the Urgent.
[time=1129] I would love to send you a copy if you'll write to us today.
[time=1132] Write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1140] And once again, our address is the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne,
[time=1146] Indiana, 46815.
[time=1150] Before we go back to our morning worship service, I want to remind you that we have the privilege of airing a living Christmas tree television special right here on WPTA Channel 21.
[time=1162] The living Christmas tree will be broadcast on Christmas Eve December the 24th at 8.30 p.m. and then again on Christmas morning at 11.30 a.m.
[time=1172] I hope that you'll be able to join us then.
[time=1174] Both the Sigglands and the Colby's are a little bit frustrated with me because I didn't make my family come through this ordeal, but they'll be on the TV special.
[time=1183] The Sigglands and Colby's, thank you for being with us this morning.
[time=1186] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1188] We hope to hear from you today. Please do write to us.
[time=1213] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=1253] Angels say that nights are cold, of Christ the Lord let's say they're born.
[time=1259] You find Him wrapped in swanly clothes, while this new Christmas morning.
[time=1266] You shall be calling and you will, the mighty God the Prince of Peace.
[time=1273] And what He says we all must know, for His love and peace He'll bring you.
[time=1282] [MUSIC]
[time=1284] When the angels went away, they shut their lips and let's go and see.
[time=1290] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=1366] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1374] That group of young people as a musical group by the name of second generation, they pointed our way to the fact that Jesus Christ is born.
[time=1383] And we shout hallelujah. The shout of victory that Christ indeed has come.
[time=1389] We're delighted today to have this opportunity to worship together as we anticipate the birth of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1397] A part of worship is fellowship. We want to encourage you right now to stand and greet those around you and wish one another a Merry Christmas.
[time=1405] Let's do that right now.
[time=1407] [MUSIC]
[time=1427] Thank you for being seated.
[time=1430] During these days of Christmas, it's most important that we remember the person of Christ.
[time=1439] And then to remember people and not to let the hurry, scurry and worry of the holidays cause us to forget that for those presents that we're buying, there's really a person there that's far more important than everything else.
[time=1453] God, thank you for the greatest person, your son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1461] While it is beyond our mind's ability to totally comprehend, we believe that He is one person, totally human and totally God.
[time=1472] We worship Him because He is God. We celebrate because He was born as a man to die for our sins.
[time=1482] Now, Father, as we come before you in this moment of prayer, we give you thanks for your Son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1491] We're thankful that we've experienced the snow, the cleansing that only He can give.
[time=1499] Father, we pray today that there would be those who today would open up the doors of their heart and receive Christ as Savior.
[time=1511] Somewhere it's snowing. Thank you.
[time=1515] Father, today we would ask you to be present.
[time=1519] Your Son has promised where two or three are gathered in His name, He would be there.
[time=1525] We are gathered here today in the name of Jesus to worship you and to say that you are God and worthy of our praise and our honor.
[time=1537] And as we open up the scriptures, God, today we would invite you to speak.
[time=1543] We invite you to speak with a word of comfort to those who are suffering.
[time=1549] We pray for Mary Lantman and Marv Eastland, Hazel Huber and Bill Van de Fort, those who battled chronic illness.
[time=1559] We pray for Reynolds Sioux Taylor.
[time=1562] We rejoice with the birth of their grandson, but pray for his physical condition that you would give wisdom to his doctors.
[time=1569] Father, today we pray that you would speak with a word of courage.
[time=1574] To fill the hearts of each of us with a winsome confidence to proclaim Christ to this community.
[time=1582] May they see Him in our lives and may they hear Him from the testimony of our lips.
[time=1588] Make us men and women of courage.
[time=1592] God, we would pray today that you would speak with a word of conviction.
[time=1597] To those who have never opened up their heart to Christ, convict them of their need for Him.
[time=1605] Father, we pray for that senior adult who is in the sunset years of their life but have lived without Christ.
[time=1613] May they overcome the obstacles of self-sufficiency and past performance.
[time=1620] Pray for those young people who feel like they have life by the tail and they're in control.
[time=1627] May they discover that you are God and you are the one who controls life.
[time=1632] May they surrender to your control.
[time=1635] Father, this morning, as we sing, as we hear music, as we open your word,
[time=1642] we agree with the hymn writer, "Glory to God in the Highest."
[time=1649] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1669] [MUSIC - 226 seconds]
[time=1910] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1913] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1915] I want to invite you to open your Bibles with us this morning that we can study the Scripture.
[time=1920] Please turn to Matthew, Matthew's second chapter, and we'll read about the visit of the three Weizmann, Matthew chapter two and verse one.
[time=1932] Now, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,
[time=1939] in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came Weizmann from the east to Jerusalem,
[time=1949] saying, "Where is He that is born, King of the Jews, for we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him." When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=1969] And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where the Christ should be born.
[time=1981] And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel."
[time=2004] Then Herod, when he had privately called the Weizmann, inquired of them diligently, what time the star appeared.
[time=2015] And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also." When they had heard the king, they departed.
[time=2037] And lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.
[time=2048] When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
[time=2054] And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary and his mother and fell down and worshiped him.
[time=2065] And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
[time=2075] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed unto their own country another way.
[time=2086] This, of course, is a very familiar portion of the narrative of the birth of Christ.
[time=2091] Matthew alone records these events of the Magi, as they're often called wise men, coming to worship the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2102] No doubt the four different gospels were given by inspiration of God to four different men, and there is some diversity so that they might reach the diverse audience of both then and now.
[time=2115] John was a humble common fisherman, and so John would write in very simple language, but he would write very clearly with illustrations of light, bread, doors, sheep.
[time=2130] Luke would write with a much more historical perspective because Luke was a Greek.
[time=2137] He was a scholar, a historian, and so as Luke would write, he would write the gospel to that Greek mind that was educated and would have details for history.
[time=2148] Matthew was a Jew, and so within his writing he writes primarily with a Hebrew audience in mind and to fulfill the prophecies that were given.
[time=2160] We don't know a great deal about these wise men or magi as they're rightly called.
[time=2166] Obviously the word magi sounds very similar to magic, and there's a relationship between the two words.
[time=2174] Many of the cultures of antiquity, the most educated people on a court were also called magicians, and they did practice some magic, but it was often also the group of the most educated, particularly in the northern lands of the east of Medo-Persia.
[time=2192] That land would call themselves the students of Zoroastrianism, and they would study magic history, but particularly astrology.
[time=2202] They're often called, and I believe most correctly, wise men.
[time=2206] Beyond that, we don't know a great deal about them.
[time=2210] Tradition says that there were three.
[time=2212] Their names, Gaspor, Melchior, and Bald Hazar.
[time=2216] We don't know those names, that's just tradition.
[time=2219] We don't know that there were three, but there are two reasons why to believe they were three.
[time=2224] One is because three gifts were given.
[time=2226] Secondly, more than three wise men will not fit on the set of most Christmas pageants.
[time=2233] We don't know how many wise men there were.
[time=2236] We simply know that they came to worship Christ.
[time=2240] We don't know exactly where they came.
[time=2243] It says the star appeared in the east.
[time=2246] However, this part of the world was known as the east.
[time=2250] Whether they came from primarily a northern direction and moved south or south and moved north, we're not quite sure.
[time=2258] There have been those that believe that this star was Hailey's Comet.
[time=2263] I remember just smiling proudly as a man explained how that if you took this date and added it to this date and you multiplied backwards, you came to the year 6 BC when Christ was born and Hailey's Comet shot overhead and the wise men saw the star and that was proof that the Bible was the inspired word of God.
[time=2283] I like that.
[time=2285] It's not at all true, but I sure liked it.
[time=2287] The Bible is the inspired word of God, but it wasn't Hailey's Comet, beloved.
[time=2293] You see, these men took a long journey.
[time=2295] And Hailey's Comet does not appear day after day after day, nor does Hailey's Comet stop precariously over Bethlehem for the wise men to find it.
[time=2308] You know what I believe this was?
[time=2310] I believe that this was a star that God spoke to.
[time=2314] You see, the very God who could take nothing and speak to nothing and out of nothing have something appear and tell the stars to be decked the sky with glory and beauty.
[time=2324] He can then say to one of those stars, you, O Ryan, or whichever one he would choose, and he could say, appear over here and gently move at the rate that I tell you and be a signal.
[time=2338] And then it's just the time that I want you to.
[time=2340] I want you to stop right here.
[time=2343] God can do that.
[time=2345] There's another suggestion as to what this star is.
[time=2348] Some have said that it is an angel, and it could very well be, because angel actually means messenger.
[time=2355] This could have been an angel appearing with brightness that would be described by the human eye as a star.
[time=2361] Billy Graham has suggested, and I think very credibly so, that there are indeed UFOs, but perhaps they are angels that are the unidentified flying objects.
[time=2372] I don't know, but I do know that the Bible says there was a star and it guided them there.
[time=2378] We don't know where they came from, who they are, but they may have been kings, because the Old Testament says that kings would come and worship the Christ child, and so we get the song, We Three Kings, coming to the birth of Christ.
[time=2394] But there are some lessons we can learn.
[time=2396] I would like to give this message a title.
[time=2398] I normally don't do that, but this one helps me.
[time=2401] I believe here we can find some contemporary lessons from some old wise men.
[time=2407] The first lesson is this, something for us to copy.
[time=2411] These men were seekers after God.
[time=2419] You know, many times we accept things without really thinking about those.
[time=2424] Now, just suppose that you're a wise man.
[time=2426] Now, I just shouldn't say suppose you are wise men and women, but you suppose you're a wise man or woman back 2,000 years ago.
[time=2433] And you're sitting up on top of your roof, and you're practicing your study of the stars, and suddenly one star starts to move.
[time=2441] Well, a shooting star or a comet, a meteor shower was not all that
[time=2447] rare.
[time=2448] Why all of a sudden are you going to go downstairs, pack up your camels, call your friends, and start on a journey of many, many days.
[time=2459] That doesn't make sense, does it?
[time=2462] But these men, no doubt, had studied the scripture.
[time=2466] You see, back in the book of Numbers, in Numbers 24, verse 17, it says this, "I shall see him, but not now.
[time=2476] I shall behold him, but not now.
[time=2479] There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall
[time=2485] rise out of Israel." And then this prophecy by Isaiah in chapter 60, verse 3, "The nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness
[time=2499] of thy rising." Old Testament believers reckoned these verses to say that when Messiah shall appear that there would be a star and a brightness that would guide the kings from other nations there.
[time=2513] No doubt these wise men were aware of the prophecies of the Old Testament, which tells us that they were searching for the Messiah.
[time=2524] You know something?
[time=2526] In life we usually see that which we seek.
[time=2531] Think about that for a moment.
[time=2533] We usually see that which we seek.
[time=2536] John Such gave me this excellent illustration a few months ago.
[time=2540] In American Indian and in New York City, man were walking down the busy streets of Manhattan.
[time=2546] It was rush hour.
[time=2548] Traffic was moving at a fast and noisy pace.
[time=2551] Subways rumbled underground.
[time=2553] Buses steamed through the city.
[time=2555] The clamor was almost deafening.
[time=2558] And the American Indian said, "I think I hear a cricket." A man from New York said, "You what?
[time=2566] No, I hear a cricket." He said, "There are horns, there's eight lanes of traffic.
[time=2571] There are people everywhere.
[time=2572] You don't hear a cricket." He said, "Yeah, I hear a cricket." He got down and found in the cracks of a sidewalk.
[time=2578] He brushed a little bit of dirt back, picked up a cricket.
[time=2583] A man from New York said, "How did you do that?" He said, "Well, it's all in what you're used to.
[time=2588] It's all in what you're listening for." He said, "Let me show you." He reached in his pocket and he dropped two quarters on the ground and everybody in New York heard them hit.
[time=2597] [laughter] You know, we really see that which we seek, don't we?
[time=2605] That's why Russian cosmonauts can fly into space and say, "We bend out of space and there is no God." And American astronauts can circle the moon and their report is this, in the beginning.
[time=2618] God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2622] Why?
[time=2623] Because we see what we seek.
[time=2626] Many of you have come to Christ.
[time=2629] It's because you have been seeking for Him.
[time=2632] Jeremiah the prophet said, "When you seek me with your whole heart, then you will find me." But you must be a seeker after God.
[time=2643] Many of you have opened the pages of the scripture, but with at best a skeptical eye.
[time=2650] Others have sat with arms folded, chin down, saying, "Hmm, I don't buy that one." You know, you'll never come to Christ till you first, with an open heart, begin to seek for Him.
[time=2666] These men with anticipation were searching for the Christ and they found Him.
[time=2673] There's a little tangent lesson here as well.
[time=2676] If it is true, and I believe it is that we see what we seek, many of us better change our perspective on our spouses, our children, our fellow workers.
[time=2686] You see, once we label somebody, we begin to seek for those qualities that we've labeled, and we see them.
[time=2695] So we look at a student who sits in our third period geometry class, the one with the pencil, always behind his ear and never on the paper.
[time=2705] And we say, "He'll never learn." And we begin to view him that way, and from that point on, all we see is a student who won't learn.
[time=2716] We look at our children, and we label them, and we say, "This one's messy.
[time=2720] This is our messy one.
[time=2721] Oh, the other two we're in need." Or, "This is our, well, let's just say the other two were a lot smarter." We begin to label them, and we then see what we've been seeking for.
[time=2734] We see their imperfections.
[time=2736] It's amazing how they're like their mother.
[time=2740] Kathy wants equal time.
[time=2742] What happens?
[time=2744] We begin to view people with a prejudiced eye, and then we wonder why they live up to it, because that's all we ever see.
[time=2752] It's important that we focus our eyes sharply and correctly.
[time=2758] These men were seekers after God.
[time=2760] Secondly, it tells us this.
[time=2763] They said, "King Herod, where is he that is born king of the Jews?
[time=2768] For we have seen his star in the east, and we have come to worship him." Worship.
[time=2774] The second thing these men did is they worshiped Christ.
[time=2778] What is worshiped to you?
[time=2780] Well, worship is Sunday morning.
[time=2781] You put on a suit and a tie and clothes.
[time=2783] You wouldn't wear anywhere else.
[time=2785] You come and you sit in straight loros, and you hope the music's good.
[time=2790] A man came to the living Christmas tree yesterday.
[time=2793] Not totally of his free will choice.
[time=2796] We gathered that when his wife had a grip on his tie and was leading him.
[time=2801] He would have rather been watching the NFL.
[time=2804] He got here at a quarter till four, thinking it started at four.
[time=2808] It started at five.
[time=2810] He had a very unpleasant hour and fifteen minutes.
[time=2814] But when it was all over, he came up to Pete and said, "That was really good. I really liked it." Except for that short guy talk too much.
[time=2823] I didn't even remember Pete saying anything.
[time=2826] (Laughter) What is worship?
[time=2829] Is that we come here and we hear some songs?
[time=2832] And then that short guy, he talks too much.
[time=2835] Well, according to this clock, there's ten minutes and fifty-two seconds.
[time=2839] What is worship?
[time=2840] Is it this form that we practice on Sunday morning?
[time=2843] No, that's not worship at all.
[time=2846] What is worship?
[time=2848] Well, let me just give you a little history of the word worship.
[time=2851] It's actually a contracted form of this phrase.
[time=2855] Worth ship.
[time=2859] It is the assigning of worth to someone or to something else.
[time=2866] It is saying this person or this object has worth above these objects or these people.
[time=2877] Here are three good tests as to what you worship, where you place your worth.
[time=2883] The first test is this.
[time=2885] Where do you spend your time?
[time=2889] You see, whatever holds worth to you, you will spend your time around those things or those people.
[time=2897] If golf is of worth to you, you'll spend time on the golf course.
[time=2901] If your family is of worth to you, you will spend time with them.
[time=2906] If your car is of worth to you, you will wash and wax it.
[time=2910] If your house is of worth to you, you will maintain it.
[time=2914] Where do you spend your time?
[time=2917] A second test of worth ship is where do you spend your energy?
[time=2924] Where is it that when you're tired, you're still willing to go?
[time=2928] When you're worn out, you're still willing to labor.
[time=2933] That is a good test of worth.
[time=2935] And then the third test of where we give our worth ship is where do we spend our money.
[time=2943] You want to know a great place to test yourself?
[time=2946] Open up your checkbook to the Ledger section.
[time=2949] Begin to read down and you'll begin to discover where you've placed your worth.
[time=2955] That will tell you.
[time=2957] You see, worship is not simply coming to a service and enduring the long talk of the short man.
[time=2967] It is recognizing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and ascribing worth to him that is above everything else.
[time=2976] But you know, we often just assume things.
[time=2980] You know, we read the three kings came and they worshiped and the shepherds left their fields and they came.
[time=2986] But let's just stop and think about that for a moment.
[time=2989] You're a shepherd.
[time=2991] Historians seem to agree that these shepherds were watching the sheep in Bethlehem that were used for sacrifice in the temple.
[time=3000] They're out on what had to be a routine assignment.
[time=3004] No doubt, there were shepherds guarding the sheep and there were others who were resting waiting for their shift.
[time=3013] Two shepherds sitting there talking, poking each other with their staffs, trying to keep each other awake, throwing a big stone out and then throwing little stones to see who can come closest to the big stone.
[time=3024] It's rather boring, there hasn't been a wolf in a long time.
[time=3029] And then an angel just happens along and we read that like, "Sure, angels appeared to shepherds every night." And then suddenly there's more angels.
[time=3037] That wasn't the way it was at all.
[time=3039] These men were terrified.
[time=3041] They'd never seen anything like this before in their life.
[time=3044] Now imagine this one.
[time=3046] The angels are gone, back to heaven.
[time=3048] The shepherds go into their hut to collect their things and they wake up the other shepherds and say, "You watch the sheep." "What do you mean you watch the sheep?" "It's not our turn, you get back out there." "No, this angel came by and told us to go to Bethlehem." Try that one on your employer next time you want to day off.
[time=3067] "No, really, boss, it was great.
[time=3069] We were just sitting in the lunchroom.
[time=3070] This angel came by and said, "Go to Blackhawk." I doubt that that one will fly.
[time=3079] Now here are these kings or these magi wise men and they are living miles, probably hundreds of miles away.
[time=3087] Phew, stargoes overhead and suddenly they're supposed to pack up everything they have, travel for days and days and days.
[time=3096] That cost them something, didn't it?
[time=3098] It wasn't just a trip around the corner and say, "Oh, there's baby Jesus." Got any change for the Salvation Army and off we go.
[time=3107] It cost them significant investment of their time and of their energy.
[time=3114] Again, we don't know.
[time=3115] It's only speculation from where they came.
[time=3117] My guess would be they came from what we now call Saudi Arabia because that's where the trees are that gold doesn't come from trees where frankincense and mer comes from.
[time=3128] If you find a tree that gives gold, will you let me know?
[time=3131] Frankincense and mer is a sap that comes out of trees.
[time=3136] And they're found down in the land that we now call Saudi Arabia.
[time=3140] These men probably came hundreds of miles needing to stop again and again for days at OACs.
[time=3147] It took significant time.
[time=3149] It cost them a great deal to make that journey an expensive energy and then the giving of precious gifts.
[time=3159] You see, they came to worth the ship hymn.
[time=3164] If we are wise, we will worship Him.
[time=3166] Not simply this morning and this hour, but we will recognize that He has more worth than anything else and we will begin to order life's journey around Him.
[time=3178] Thirdly, these wise men were wise in that they came bearing gifts.
[time=3183] Let me suggest two obvious gifts that we should be the giver.
[time=3188] The first and the most clear is that we should give our heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3195] One historian wrote these words so clear that I want to borrow them.
[time=3201] That there was no room in the inn was symbolic of what was to happen to Jesus.
[time=3207] The only place that there was room for Him was on the cross.
[time=3213] He sought entry into the overcrowded hearts of men.
[time=3219] He could not find it.
[time=3222] And still, the search and the rejection goes on.
[time=3230] What should you give if you're a wise man, a wise woman?
[time=3235] You should give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3238] More than anything else, He wants entrance into your heart.
[time=3242] He doesn't want your person sitting in a chair in this auditorium or viewing by way of television.
[time=3250] He wants entrance into your heart.
[time=3253] And only you can give Him that gift.
[time=3255] I can't say I'll let you Jesus into George's heart.
[time=3259] Only you can open that door.
[time=3262] But if you're a believer today, there's a second gift that you can give Him.
[time=3266] It is the gift of obedience, a man by the name of Eugene Peterson has written a book.
[time=3273] The title alone is worth meditation.
[time=3276] It's called a long obedience in the same direction.
[time=3284] Most of us live like butter on a hot skillet.
[time=3287] We hit and spread fast in every direction.
[time=3291] A long obedience in the same direction.
[time=3295] The second gift we can give is obedience.
[time=3299] Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." In that book, Peterson writes, "We have been programmed by thirty second commercials.
[time=3310] Our attention span is so short.
[time=3314] Most of us have given up on the lifelong pursuit of obedience."
[time=3320] If you've never given your heart to Christ, the gift that He wants from you today is your life.
[time=3325] If you have received Him, He wants your obedience.
[time=3328] Study the word.
[time=3330] Jesus said, "Search the scriptures there which testify of me."
[time=3336] Then finally, this tangent thought as we speak about gifts.
[time=3341] This comes from the pen of my favorite author, Charles Swindall.
[time=3345] He says, "It's not too late to give some things away for Christmas.
[time=3349] Oh, not just on Christmas day, but all the days after December the twenty-fifth."
[time=3356] We can call these our daily gifts, our Christmas projects.
[time=3360] And he suggests these thirty-two Christmas gifts.
[time=3364] At least let me share a part of the list with you.
[time=3367] A Christmas gift for you to give.
[time=3371] Men de quarrel. Seek out a forgotten friend.
[time=3377] Dismiss suspicion.
[time=3381] Write a long overdue note.
[time=3384] Hug someone tightly and whisper, "I love you." Forgive an enemy.
[time=3392] Be gentle and patient with an angry person.
[time=3397] Express appreciation.
[time=3400] Find time to keep a promise.
[time=3404] Release a grudge.
[time=3407] How about this one? Listen.
[time=3412] Enter into another's sorrow.
[time=3415] Smile. Laugh a lot.
[time=3418] Laugh a little bit more.
[time=3422] Take a walk with a friend who's lonely.
[time=3426] Lesson your demands and expectations on others.
[time=3432] Apologize if you were wrong.
[time=3435] Apologize even if you weren't.
[time=3438] Talk together with the television set off.
[time=3443] Treat someone to an ice cream cone.
[time=3446] I'm available.
[time=3448] Do some dishes for the family.
[time=3451] Pray for someone who is hurting.
[time=3455] Encourage an older person.
[time=3459] Give your teacher a break.
[time=3462] Be especially cooperative.
[time=3465] Give a soft answer, even when you feel strongly.
[time=3470] We can be wise men and women today by the gifts that we give.
[time=3475] Come, don't even take a credit card.
[time=3478] What gift does God want from you He wants your heart?
[time=3481] Have you received him a savior if you never have today?
[time=3485] Would you open up your heart and invite him in if you have?
[time=3490] Will you begin the adventure of obedience?
[time=3493] I pray that you will.
[time=3496] Thank you for joining us today for this special program

[time=3522] Will you pray with me?
[time=3524] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you especially for this season and I thank you for the fact that Jesus Christ was sent here for my sins.
[time=3534] Today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3539] I ask you to come in and cleanse me today.
