[time=271] There's a joy on this weekend between Christmas and New Year's to come together and to sing the birth of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. We want to welcome you to our morning worship service today.
[time=285] We sincerely pray that God will use this time in each of our lives to better understand the purpose of His giving His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, so that we can know Him as Savior and His Lord.
[time=297] We want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=301] We are allowing us to come into your home or your hospital room and to share with you the message of Christmas that Christ has come, not only as He come to the world but that He can come to each of our hearts that we can know Him personally. Christmas music should be played all year long.
[time=317] Oh, come all ye faithful and make a great July anthem as well, wouldn't it?
[time=321] But this season we have the blessing of hearing music that particularly addresses the fact that Christ has come. Our acquirer the last performance of the Living Christmas Tree this year as they sing for us now, a medley of songs that speak about Christ's birth.
[time=359] (Music)
[time=533] (Applause)
[time=541] I personally want to say a special thank you to our acquirer who have been involved nearly every night of the week for the last two almost three weeks.
[time=549] We appreciate their faithfulness, their ministry through the medium of music.
[time=553] I know that it touched many hearts during this Christmas season. We had the opportunity to meet and to be introduced to a lot of people that are aware of Black Hawk Baptist Church because of the Bible hour and because of special ministries that we have here and because you as friends invited your neighbors to come, we heard from many of your neighbors through letters and telephone calls thanking us for our ministry and we appreciate the choir and all those that worked throughout the Living Christmas Tree performances so that we could minister in this way to the community of Fort Wayne. Let's continue now. We want you to join the choir in a medley of Carols and you just as the introduction comes I won't give you the page. I think you'll know the verses, the first verses of several of the Carols. Let's just join the choir and sing together as one angelic chorus.
[time=605] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=839] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=843] We love to sing the Christmas Carols. See a manger scene and to imagine what it would have been like, even to be just a lowly shepherd on that night, but the privilege that you and I have of knowing Jesus Christ as Savior exceeds all of that by
[time=858] far. He is the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=862] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=1058] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1062] Again, we want to say hello and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. Pete, this is our last chance to stand in front of the tree and to hear the choir sing in it. Yes, we've had a tremendous two weeks and I'd like to just take a moment to thank the people that came that watched the Bible Hour regularly. We saw a lot of you, we met you and it was just really thrilling to know that you support not only the living Christmas tree but our program week to week and Rick, that was really thrilling for me to see all the people that many of whom attend their service and then get home quickly and watch the Bible Hour. That is truly a joy to meet many of you and we want to thank the community of Fort Wayne and really Western Ohio and Northeastern Indiana for their support of the living Christmas tree.
[time=1106] We haven't totaled the attendance yet but no doubt it's somewhere between 15 and 17,000 and Pete, many, many of those people brought canned food goods to be given to agencies to help those who were in need. Yes, last Saturday Rick, the Baptist children's home stopped in. Actually, that was just yesterday and got the final food canned goods and boy, we just had a lot of food and we're just delightful that we had the opportunity to give to. I think five organizations, wasn't it? Right and many of the ones right here in Fort Wayne like the Salvation Army told us how desperate they were in need of food so to those of you who brought in food, thank you very much. Well, Pete, the choir is saying the choir medley of the carols and the Christmas songs and tomorrow it all comes down. That has to be a sad day for you. Yeah, it is. When you walk into the empty auditorium and you see it and know that you have to tear it down, there's something about it and yet there's an expectation that there's another year ahead of us and we have to begin planning immediately for next year's program. Well, that creates a little bit of tyranny of the urgent as you begin to think about not getting one tree over before another one comes and that's the title of a booklet as well. We want to share with you called the tyranny of the urgent. This is a small pamphlet that has a big message.
[time=1182] The message is to help us focus our priorities so that the things that we really believe are important in our life get done and not squeezed out by those little things that somehow have to get done flare up with great urgency and demand our attention and then the day is gone, the days blend into a week and then the week to a month and suddenly we really have never done the things that we have set are important in life. Many of us allow the urgent things of life to tyrannize us and to squeeze out those things that are spiritually so important. This little booklet I'm sure will go a long way to helping each of us in order to manage our priorities and not to be a victim of the tyranny of the urgent. If you'll write to us today we'll be quick to send you a copy so that you can have this helpful booklet. Let me encourage the viewers to write to the Bible hour today. That's the Bible hour, box 15,000. Fort Wayne Indiana in the zip is 46815. That's the Bible hour, box 15,000. Fort Wayne Indiana 46815. Well today is the last Sunday of 1985. Next Sunday begins a brand new year and one of the traditions here at Blackhawk is a candlelight service. It will be held this year on New Year's Eve at 7 o'clock.
[time=1266] At this candlelight service I'll be giving a short message and then we'll be turning the microphones over to the people who are here to give notes of praise for the past year and notes of commitment and expectation for the new year. We want to invite you to join us if you're not worshipping this New Year's Eve to end this past year and to bring in the next year with a spiritual focus and join us here at Blackhawk at 7 o'clock New Year's Eve December the 31st for candlelight sharing time.
[time=1298] We'd love to have you join us. We're located on the East State Street at 7321 East State Boulevard about three miles east of the bypass. We'd love to help you join us for a candlelight service. Again thank you for joining us today.
[time=1314] We're looking forward to hearing the ministry of music of our friends Stephen Maria Gardner as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1322] Just lately I wonder what it would have been like to be married.
[time=1326] To actually have carried Jesus within me and to hold him in my arms and to look at him in the face.
[time=1334] To know that he was God in flesh.
[time=1342] But a privilege it would be.
[time=1346] There's a silent celebration
[time=1354] in this heart of mine It's like the gentle lullaby I see.
[time=1364] And as I look with quiet wonder at my sleeping child I know that he is born to be
[time=1378] a king.
[time=1386] There's a silent celebration only God can see.
[time=1394] For he understands the mystery that I've made.
[time=1398] That an angel spoke my name and told a prophecy and tonight my love can touch what he foretold.
[time=1412] A silent celebration for a sleeping child.
[time=1420] The lips that long to sing Hosanna only wear a quiet smile and very softly now to speak his name.
[time=1434] All of you, Jesus.
[time=1440] Jesus.
[time=1446] His name speaks please please.
[time=1454] There's a silent celebration of a miracle just to think that God would let me have a part.
[time=1470] When he placed his might and power in a little child he placed a silent celebration in my heart.
[time=1486] It's a silent celebration.
[time=1494] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=1518] While the scripture tells us that Mary pondered all of these things in her heart I can't help but wonder how Joseph must have felt bewildering I'm sure to find that your wife to be is already expecting a child and yet God was able to provide peace for him. Even the name of Jesus brought peace and his name still brings peace.
[time=1542] Peace to me so softly and tenderly and the worries inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace to me worries inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace to me
[time=1598] His name speaks peace to me so softly and tenderly
[time=1614] and the worries
[time=1620] inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace to be worries inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace
[time=1654] to be sleep in heaven sleep in heaven
[time=1680] [MUSIC]
[time=1690] Greeks came to Philip and said to him we would see Jesus thank you Steve Maria for providing for us a ministry of music that allows us to see the Lord Jesus. We've come to see him today let us look to him in prayer.

I want to invite you to open your Bible with us to the book of 1 Corinthians many of you are here for the holidays visiting family members but more of us are regulars here at Blackhawk through the fall and into the winter we've been studying 1 Corinthians. We took a few weeks away at Christmas time but today I would like us to return to 1 Corinthians in the sixth chapter this is our landmark Sunday this Sunday marks the end of a year it gives us a time of reflection what has this year been like it introduces us with anticipation to a new year what opportunities will be there what challenges are yet ahead of us the Bible I believe is relevant with its entirety but there's probably no more passage of Scripture more relevant to those of us who inhabit the 80's than this passage your 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 through the end of the chapter but today we'll just look at verses 9 through 14 a relevant practical text of the scripture Paul writes to the Church of Corinth "No ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor a feminine nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revelers nor prisoners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought into the power of any foods for the body and the body for foods but God shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his power a few weeks ago we started in on this passage of scripture that begins with verse 9 which has such a bold declaration intimidating frightening it says no ye not expectation that will know something that the righteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God and then it goes on to give what I believe to be a random sample of sins 10 in number in no way is Paul saying these 10 are the 10 sins that will keep you from heaven anything else is fine or at least marginally acceptable no I believe he chose 10 just to give them a sample of what he meant by unrighteousness and so he gives us 10 some of those 10 are 10 sins that traditionally we viewed as inappropriate immorality almost sexuality but then as the list goes on it starts to be come all together familiar simple things like greediness that's what the word covetous means slandering gossip is what that means
[time=2134] begins to touch on those areas that we somehow found more acceptable at least socially so and so as God is speaking here he speaks giving us a random sample that broadly identifies sins a few weeks ago we spoke on two of these the two that referred to homosexuality today we'll look at the first three they are fornication idolatry and adultery those three are the subject of the next chapter of first Corinthians the rest of chapter six and into chapter seven as he would speak about marriage and its values and its virtues but now he speaks about fornication what is that that's a generic word you know how you go to the supermarkets and there they have the name brand lima beans and then they have the store brand lima beans and then they have the white labels with the black letters and it says lima beans generic generic is a word that means without name specifically fornication is a generic term it refers to sexual immorality without becoming specific as to what kind for example if a married married man becomes sexually involved with a woman that is not his wife that is immorality called adultery that is the breaking the polluting of the marriage vows if two people who are not married are sexually involved we call that premarital that is immorality fornication if there are two people who are of the same sex engaging we call that homosexuality those are more specific terms fornication is a generic term that speaks about any and all forms of sexual immorality adultery we've already described is the breaking of the marriage vow perhaps to the surprise of many of us in between there is the sin of idolatry most of us know idolatry as creating an image setting it up on a platform and saying this is God and worshiping it it almost seems to be out of place why did he jump from a sexual sin to idolatry back to a sexual sin doesn't seem logical but it really was because you see their religion called them to immorality let me give you a further insight if i might into what idolatry is it's not simply the forming of a little statue placing it in a prominent place and saying this is God no it's more than that first of all idolatry is the refusal to allow the true God to have his rightful place in our lives that's saying God we will dethrone you because we don't like you we don't like what you've said we don't like what believing in you demands of us so we move God off of his throne and so then there comes the need to create a new God what God will we put on that throne well if we make our own God then we have the privilege of putting our words in God's mouth we can then listen to God speak and when he speaks he will say those things that we would like to hear and so an idol speaks and it calls its worshipers to obedience and the people gladly obey because the idolat said what they want to hear in Corinth there was a high hill called the high hill that's what archo Corinth means the high hill of Corinth the high place it was 100 or excuse me 1,750 feet above sea level that doesn't seem all that high but remember Corinth is at sea level so it's a rather abrupt protrusion out of the ground very prominent and on top of that high hill they placed the largest building of Corinth a temple to their patron goddess each Greek city would have its own god or goddess for Corinth it was the goddess of Aphrodite who was called the goddess of beauty and of love so in this city on a prominent hill the largest building was a temple to Aphrodite the goddess of love how Aphrodite spoke she spoke through her priests and priestesses men and women who served in the temple they called them priests but they were actually prostitutes nightly they would come out of the city carrying torches down into the city calling men and women to engage in immorality in the name of their religion that was their form of worship so idolatry does fit here it was the voice of society to them it was the voice of god that said come and indulge in some ways that seems all together archaic but if you simply take out the temple me idol it's today if you simply take out Aphrodite and plug in humanism it's today and if you simply take out the word priest and call them educators or television stars or musical performers it is today if you take out the name religion and put in situational ethics it is today situational ethics received its popularity through a book of the same title by a man named Joseph Fletcher he begins the work with this illustration a very very wealthy man a multi-millionaire somebody known for his wealth said to an attractive young woman I will give you and he named an enormous amount of money she will spend the night with me she contemplated and agreed he then said let's talk for a moment how about a hundred thousand dollars instead well she thought agreed again he then reduced the offer to ten thousand dollars and again she thought but agreed then he finally said well how about a hundred dollars with indignation the young woman said listen mister what do you think I am anyway the man said young lady we've already established what you are we're simply haggling over the price that illustration began to be the framework for a philosophy of ethics that said each situation is neither right nor wrong absolutely but only if the price is right the situation determines the rightness or the wrongness of an act now we live in a society that says sex it's been deregulated it's a natural function of life you choose you decide if it's right for you you decide if it's meaningful for you you decide whether it might even be something that will build a little self-esteem in your life it's neither right nor wrong the Corinthians argued with Paul he anticipated that argument he has just said you're not going to inherit the kingdom of God and they said oh wait a minute Paul wait a minute Paul why we've got this stuff you wrote right here of the Galatians and in Galatians chapter 5 verse 1 Paul you said let no man enslave you to sin and to the law why Paul you're teaching the law here with all these do's and don'ts and in Romans Romans chapter 14 or excuse me chapter 6 verse 14 it says for you are not under the law but under grace Paul were under grace we don't need this ten commandment business
[time=2662] so Paul anticipates them and the Corinthians argued in two forms of logic if you will perhaps ill logic they argued first of all that the law is gone and sex has been deregulated and then secondly they argued that sex was a natural biological function and should be treated as nothing more or less than eating supper let's look at those arguments and how Paul responded each verse 12 they say and Paul's quoting them all things are
[time=2693] lawful to me they're saying the law is dead and to a degree they're right now we need to understand the Old Testament law
[time=2703] was given to Israel and because it was given to a nation that God was trying to uniquely shape some of the laws were very very unique it may be that God gave those laws to protect them from things that they didn't understand but it was probably just as much as he was trying to teach them obedience and to walk uniquely laws like this you can eat pork if you're a Gentile but you can't eat it if you're a Jew now if you are a Hebrew you can eat either one if it's a cow you say well it meets meat but they had a unique law that they were to live by now they say well Paul don't you remember Peter saw this big sheet coming down from heaven and on it were clean animals and unclean animals and Peter said oh I can't eat that unclean and God said Peter take and eat it it's now clean you see Paul God's done away with the whole law we can eat anything we want everything has been deregulated including sex now Paul argues with that logic that everything has been deregulated all things are lawful he argues first of all along this line of reasoning he says this all things are lawful that's not a good word because it's not the word law no moss it's simply a word that means permissible it really is a word that says there's an absent of law okay maybe the Old Testament law isn't in effect but even if it was profitable it's not profitable or advantageous Paul said just because there's not a rule out there saying you can't do it doesn't mean you should do it I'm not certain I don't know all the laws of Fort Wayne but I don't believe there is a law that says you cannot dive off of one summit square now just because there's a law are the absence of a law that says you cannot take a swan dive off of a 26 story building it doesn't mean that it's therefore permissible and profitable and desirable the absence of a given law does not therefore declare its acceptability Paul says it's not profitable Paul says our lives have been given to God to serve him and immorality is not profitable it's not advantageous it's not really that there was an absence of the law most scholars believe that the Old Testament law can be divided into three categories dietary laws eat ribs only if they're from a cow ceremonial law which says wash yourself this way with this spice and this ingredient and you will be ceremonial clean sacrifice this animal for this sin this animal for that that's ceremonial and then thirdly moral I believe as do almost all students of the Bible that the law that is passed away are the dietary laws and the ceremonial laws but not the moral laws and the proof of that is the moral laws are reinstituted reinstituted in the New Testament the New Testament says don't commit adultery the New Testament says thou shall not kill the New Testament says don't lie we call that a new law but it's a unique law it's called the perfect law of liberty the royal law of the law of Christ so Paul says no it's not acceptable just because we're no longer under the whole Hebrew system doesn't mean that we're now no longer under moral ethics it's not profitable and then secondly he argues this way he says all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the bondage of many he says that sin has an addictive power in our lives we always think of drugs when we heard the word addiction or maybe alcohol but beloved know this sexual sins are as addictive as any narcotic much has been written and correctly so about the addictive nature of pornography of how it is like a drug that you reach a level of threshold where you have to see more and more something more bizarre pornography is addicting and so is sexual immorality a young man who was home for the holidays is a recent graduate with a master's degree in counseling and he still told me between the two services this morning that he is now familiar with a group for sexual addicts just like there's a group for drug addicts an alcoholic anonymous type group for those who are addicted to sex Paul said even if something is permissible I'm not going to allow myself to participate in something that is going to re-enslave me one writer said this God did not send his son to die on the cross to set us free only to be re-enslaved to a new bondage the freedom in Christ said Augustine is not the freedom to do what we want but for the first time in our life freedom in Christ gives us the power to do what we ought not the power to do what we want but the power to do what we ought Augustine said before Christ came into my heart I was free to sin if I wanted to sin this way I could do it if I wanted to sin that way I could do it the only freedom I didn't have was the freedom not to sin he said but when Christ came into my heart it became a new person and for the first time Augustine said I was free not to sin Paul argues here no it is not an antinomian world there are laws there are ethics and they are not situational they are absolute and given by God then the Corinthian said well even if sex hasn't been deregulated it's just a natural biological function he said food for the stomach the stomach for food well that makes sense doesn't it I mean I have this stomach that growls if it doesn't get fed every 15 minutes or so you know this stomach was made for one thing the digestion of food it's a natural part of life to eat stomach goes to work that organ is there to digest food well they argued the foods for stomach the stomachs for food and the bodies for sex I mean God made a sexual our bodies are for sex it is a natural function and should be deregulated notice what God said food for the body and the body for food but they are going to be destroyed they are going to pass away but your body is not for fornication your body is for the Lord think about that one we often talk about inviting Jesus Christ to come into your heart a spiritual new birth all of that is true but you know God is just as interested in your body as he is in your soul here it says the body was made for the Lord and the Lord for the body do you know that most people who engage in morality do not do it for a sexual purpose that sounds strange doesn't your price scratching your head what do you mean they engage in sex for non sexual purposes in our society sex has become a substitute it has become a substitute for God people engage in sex trying to get something else but they don't get it let me give you some illustrations a person has a very low self-esteem they have a poor self-image they feel unwanted undesirable someone comes along and wants them even if it's only sexually somebody wants them and so they give to that person sex hoping in exchange they'll get worth only God can give worth to life somebody else wants love psychologists say our society is dying of love deprivation that's a fancy way of saying we feel deprived of love we feel that no one loves me so someone comes into our life and she says I love you make love to me and so we give sex hoping we'll get back love but we only get back broken relationships psychologists tell us we're looking for lasting relationships and so someone gives their body hoping that when they give their body they'll get back a person the person only gives their body not their name not their life and they're gone women and women are looking for social acceptance and so they go to work in a company and in that company everybody is known as a free thinker and a free liver and everyone else is doing it and so there is the pressure to conform and we think that if I do what these people do what they expect of me they will accept me they don't accept us anymore any less they simply find us as dirty as they find themselves
[time=3297] we live in a society that is calling us immorality they're saying it's just a natural function of life and we are constantly giving sex as a substitute and no one is finding satisfaction a young girl by the name of Gretchen was a freshman at San Jose State in California her testimony is written in Josh McDowell's book Givers, Takers and other kinds of lovers that's a good title isn't it Gretchen writes there I was a freshman on the big university campus prepared for the great life I had everything that a college freshman needed a package of number two pencils and a package of birth control pills waiting for the great life she said at the end of my first semester I felt dirty and used it wasn't a great life you see sex is not a substitute for self-worth sex is not a substitute for love it is not a substitute for social acceptability it is not a substitute for our relationship
[time=3359] only God can do that there is a God shaped vacuum in each of us that is not only spiritual it is physical until we give our life to God we'll never know fulfillment don't misunderstand I'm not saying sex is a four letter word God's created sex it is good it is wholesome he simply said within the confines of marriage is pure God has made you for himself would you give yourself to him not just soul but he wants your body would you give it to him I pray that you will or God and our father as we bow before you this week
