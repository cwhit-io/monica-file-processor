[time=90] [MUSIC]
[time=101] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=104] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and the message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Pops.
[time=119] Join us won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=122] [MUSIC] When Christ shall come [MUSIC] We shall come back to the creation hour [MUSIC] And take me home [MUSIC] What joys shall come [MUSIC] And how shall come [MUSIC] We shall come back to the creation hour [MUSIC] And therefore play in my heart, I'll bring the Lord [MUSIC] And since my soul, I say to God to thee [MUSIC] I'll bring the Lord [MUSIC] I'll bring the Lord [MUSIC] And since my soul, I say to God to thee [MUSIC] I'll bring the Lord [MUSIC] I'll bring the Lord [MUSIC]
[time=253] [MUSIC - 159 seconds]
[time=452] All hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[time=463] Let's continue with that theme as we sing the hymn found on hymn number 18.
[time=468] We'll sing together the first, second, and fourth stanzas of hymn number 18.
[time=473] [MUSIC - 77 seconds]
[time=584] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=586] We appreciate it when you participate in the Congregational Singing from Sunday to Sunday.
[time=591] People ask from time to time how do I join the Sanctuary Choir of the Black Hawk Baptist Church?
[time=596] Well, there are times when it's a more convenient time for you to join than others.
[time=600] And January is a very convenient time for you to join our choir.
[time=604] If you're here and you're a member of our church and you're interested in joining, you'd be sure to see me after one of the services or call the music office.
[time=612] We'd be glad to explain to you what it means to be a member of our choir.
[time=616] We appreciate the musicians that we have in our church and we've given them a little bit of a break.
[time=621] Last week, we had an emergency and we needed some help, so we called on Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=627] They were also scheduled for this week.
[time=629] We're delighted that we don't have very many opportunities for them to be here, but when they're here, we want to take advantage of them.
[time=635] They're members of our church.
[time=637] They travel on a regular basis to other churches ministering through music, but what a delight it is to have them in our own home church.
[time=644] So, Steve and Maria, we're glad you're here today.
[time=647] Let's listen to them as they minister to us through the medium of music.
[time=669] Whenever it rains, God sends a rainbow, behind every cloud there's a sunshine and bright.
[time=678] Whenever it rains, God sends a rainbow.
[time=682] As sure as the sun rides, we'll follow the night.
[time=687] He sends a sunlight right through the rain, and cars blow the world with his smile.
[time=696] Whenever it rains, God sends a rainbow, and that's just the start of God's love.
[time=705] Whenever you're lost to walk beside you, he isn't a faithful or fair weather friend.
[time=721] Whenever you're lost, he's there to guide you.
[time=725] Through the good and the bad, he will stay to the end.
[time=730] He knows where you've been, he knows where you're going and he'd love to show you the way.
[time=739] Whenever you're lost to walk beside you, and that's just the start of God's love.
[time=750] When your life is all done, you live forever.
[time=754] He's gone on ahead to prepare you a place.
[time=759] When life is all done, you live forever.
[time=763] Just to think, just to see him oppose face to face.
[time=768] This promise you'll keep for his love is so deep that he's gone to make it so.
[time=778] So when your life is all done, you live forever.
[time=783] And that's just the start of God's.
[time=786] That's just the start of God's, that's just the start of God's love.
[time=808] It is always a joy to have our friends, Steve and Maria Gardner here with us, isn't it Pete?
[time=813] Yes it is, Rick.
[time=814] They're gone a lot because they have the opportunity to minister to many, many churches throughout the year with their musical ministry.
[time=821] But since they're members of our church during the Christmas time, it seems like they have an opportunity to be with us more.
[time=827] And we're glad that they're here not only to fellowship with us, but to sing for us this morning.
[time=831] Just about a month or a little bit more than that, we had the privilege of premiering their latest album here.
[time=837] We had about a thousand people, maybe a few more than a thousand come and many of them were Bible hour watchers who appreciate them a great deal.
[time=845] The title of their new album is The Greatest Love Song and it is a very interesting album.
[time=850] It's very inspiring and encouraging.
[time=853] You know, they travel literally from coast to coast and even our overseas occasionally singing for the Lord.
[time=859] We love them as friends and a part of our church and are delighted that they're here today.
[time=863] That is really great.
[time=865] Pete, you're recovering from the living Christmas tree and now you have another project, a new album coming up.
[time=870] We will have a little bit of a break somewhere in July, I think, but during the month of January we'll be preparing for a new album.
[time=876] It's entitled Celebration of Praise. Our choir will be doing it.
[time=880] It's an exciting album that will be out about the middle of March.
[time=884] And we have a lot of work to do this month in preparing for the recording that we'll do February 1st and February 8th.
[time=890] Well, that's something we'll all look forward to and we'll have the chance of hearing a great deal of that music on the Bible hour.
[time=897] Today, for one final time, we want to encourage you to write for a helpful pamphlet that's entitled The Tyranny of the Urgent.
[time=906] We are beginning a brand new year. Today is the first Sunday of 1986 and many of us have made New Year's resolutions.
[time=915] Some of my New Year's resolutions centered around the dining room table and the commitment to spend less time there eating.
[time=922] But as we make New Year's resolutions, I think one of the most important things that we could do would be to make a commitment to be faithful and prayer and study of God's Word.
[time=932] Pete, it's amazing, isn't it? How the urgent little things that aren't all that important, they're simply urgent, squeeze out the important things, isn't it?
[time=940] It happens in our life on a daily basis and the book entitled The Tyranny of the Urgent really encourages us to point out and to search out those things that are most important in our lives so that we can grow spiritually in God's Word.
[time=954] One of the things I've enjoyed reading recently are books on management.
[time=959] I listened to a whole series of messages on managing your time and the principles that were being shared in this rather expensive cassette program weren't any different than what this simple little pamphlet was bringing out of God's Word, doing the important things first.
[time=975] And there's not anything more important than maintaining our relationship with the Lord. The Tyranny of the Urgent. We want to send you a copy free.
[time=983] If you'll simply write to us, we'll mail it to you as a New Year's way of making some new commitments. Simply write to us today and we'll be glad to send you a copy.
[time=994] You can receive the Tyranny of the Urgent by writing to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1004] Simply ask for the pamphlet, The Tyranny of the Urgent, write to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip 46815.
[time=1015] Many of you have come to the Living Christmas Tree or the Steve Maria concert and it's been a joy for us to meet you face to face. Many others also write notes to let us know they're watching and what they have appreciated about the ministry.
[time=1029] As we begin a new year, we want to encourage you to write. It's such a strength to our lives to know that you're watching and that God is using this ministry in some way.
[time=1039] So if you have the time today, would you just jot down and let us know what's happening in your life spiritually? Our address once again is the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1054] Now we're going to return to our morning worship service and again hear the ministry of Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=1084] In his love went on reaching right past the shackles of my mind
[time=1105] and the word of the Father became Mary's little son and his love reached all the way to where I was.
[time=1134] It's been nearly 2,000 years since Jesus Christ came to this planet, physically walked this earth, touching people wherever he went, healing their bodies, restoring them to God the Father.
[time=1150] But the passage of time, even 2,000 years, has not diminished one bit his ability to reach out and touch us today. That's why we meet like this.
[time=1160] God still is able to reach down and touch us, to meet our needs, to restore us to the Father, to show us his love.
[time=1169] Yes, his love, still is longing and his love, still is reaching right past the shackles of my mind
[time=1195] because the word of the Father became Mary's little son and his love reached all the way to where I was.
[time=1222] Reaching, logging, logging, logging and searching
[time=1251] became Mary's little son and his love
[time=1271] still reaches out to where I was.
[time=1289] Most of us have heard from the time we were children that God is love and I can't think of a subject that has been more sung about and yet perhaps less understood than the subject of love.
[time=1300] In our culture, we have reduced it to an emotion. We have often twisted and abused it, perverted it, but love is far more than an emotion.
[time=1311] Love is a choice. God chose to love each one of us while we were lost in sin, far from him. He chose to love us.
[time=1320] And he has given us the ability to choose to love him and each other, husbands and wives.
[time=1329] Choices, every day we make choices, most of them are small and it seems as though they have no significance at all.
[time=1349] But these choices each one leads us to more choices.
[time=1364] Step by step we're charting a course that will lead in a direction for you.
[time=1374] And for me, choices of love, we can make them each day.
[time=1383] All the Father of God has shown us the way with choices of love.
[time=1396] We're learning that we can love if we want to, and we can want to if we choose to.
[time=1403] My love, every day I pledge you, my love, my love.
[time=1414] For saking all the rest I cling to you, and each day we can choose to make our lives so new.
[time=1428] My love, with each sunrise I pledge my love.
[time=1439] In sickness and ill, in poverty or war, you and I have become one.
[time=1449] We'll stay one, choices of love, we can make them each day.
[time=1457] For the Father of God has shown us the way with choices of love.
[time=1468] For he has a solution that can believe for the need of his own.
[time=1476] You and me, we must see those choices of love.
[time=1483] We can make them each day.
[time=1486] All the Father of God has shown us the way with choices of love.
[time=1498] Choices of love, choices of love.
[time=1513] Choices of love.
[time=1524] Do you remember as a teenager how you instantly fell in love?
[time=1532] We often talk about love as though it's a geographical region somewhere between Fort Wayne and New Haven,
[time=1538] and you fall into it unaware.
[time=1541] Actually, it's a conscious choice we make, isn't it?
[time=1544] We choose the love.
[time=1546] We choose the love God and accept his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=1550] We choose the love, our husbands, our wives, our children, our parents.
[time=1555] We also then choose not to love.
[time=1558] Choose not to love our wife, our husband, our children, our parents.
[time=1565] God, your word sets before us choices.
[time=1569] Father, thank you for the message of a song that would remind us that we can choose our emotions.
[time=1575] Thank you that your word reminds us to be men and women who act and who do not react.
[time=1582] Make us decisive men and women who wisely choose to honor you and your word and our families.
[time=1591] Father, we come today because we believe in your Son, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1597] We've sung all hail the power of Jesus' name because we believe as you have declared that his name is above every name.
[time=1604] We've come to worship today.
[time=1607] So Father, as we worship you, we come with a selfish motive that by worshiping you will find fulfillment in our lives.
[time=1615] So today we pray that by your word you would direct us, give us insight for living, encouragement for our walk.
[time=1623] Father, today we think of those who are not here.
[time=1628] Some whose life are in the balance.
[time=1632] We pray most particularly for Michelle Bailey that right now as a team of doctors work on her,
[time=1638] that they would have wisdom as they treat her body and to know what to do to make her heart function properly.
[time=1645] Pray that your hand would be upon her.
[time=1648] We pray for Mary Lampman and Phyllis Hopkins, Helen Weimer, Hazel Huber, other friends and friends of this body who are struggling with cancer.
[time=1663] We pray today for those who have lost loved ones, particularly those who have lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=1671] Pray for Joyce Schindler.
[time=1676] Pray for Connie and Glenn and Scott Wills.
[time=1681] We think today of Nancy Jackson, Todd and Rob and Greg.
[time=1687] Father, these days are amongst the most difficult.
[time=1691] So we pray that you would by your grace carry them through this valley of life.
[time=1697] Father, we sit so secure and comfortable with all that we possess.
[time=1705] And then suddenly we discover that it can be taken away in a moment.
[time=1711] Teach us to hold things loosely, not to love less, but to possess less.
[time=1717] Help us to look at eternity.
[time=1720] Give us new eyes, Lord.
[time=1722] Help us to get beyond the pleasure that is the ethic of our day and find purpose in serving you.
[time=1730] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1734] These statistics were forwarded to me by a friend and as they came across my desk, I saved him for this message because I wanted to share them with you.
[time=1747] An accurate description of today says by the age of 19, 80% of the males and 67% of the females have engaged physically in sex.
[time=1765] By age 19, 80% of the males, 67% of the females of America have engaged in physical sexual relationships.
[time=1777] More than 50% of the 21 million teenagers between the ages of 15, that's a sophomore in high school, and 19, more than 50% of them are sexually active.
[time=1791] That phrase means not simply that they've experimented, but it's an ongoing dimension of their life.
[time=1797] There were 1.1 million teenage pregnancies last year in this country which represented over 30% of the legal "abortions" that were done in our country, over 400,000 of them.
[time=1812] Those are the times in which we live. That's the ethic of our society.
[time=1817] But lest you or I think that we live in a little closet that's free from much of all this, that we somehow aren't tempted or always overcome temptation, the statistics go on.
[time=1834] 62% of 500 church youth who were surveyed said they had been involved sexually.
[time=1842] It is estimated that between 55 and 60% of all evangelical Christian youths are involved physically in sex.
[time=1853] That's the times in which we live today. There is the beat of the modern generation of which I am a part in most of you.
[time=1860] I'm not talking simply about the teen generation. We might call it the under 40 crowd. Maybe it's over 40 today.
[time=1868] But the drum beat goes on. It goes back as far as the 60s with Eric Burden beating the drum and saying, "It's my life. I'll do what I want to do."
[time=1879] It's voices of Rod Stewart saying, "If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, come on baby, show."
[time=1887] It's voices of one who would say, "I'm a material girl and I live in a material world. I live on the physical edge of life."
[time=1895] It's voices that say, "Girls just want to have fun." Girls just want to have fun. Isn't that really what life is all about?
[time=1904] Aren't all of us here on some type of personal pleasure tour? Girls just want to have fun.
[time=1913] And so a society has listened, not simply to the artists of the airwaves, but to the television, to the magazines, to the philosophers, to the theologians of a liberal persuasion who have said, "It's play time."
[time=1931] And our bodies are nothing but the toys with which God has given us to play.
[time=1937] When Craig Clapper was here, he illiterated and helped us by saying there were three views of sex.
[time=1944] There's the Playboy view of sex, which probably needs no description.
[time=1950] It comes to an extreme, but there's another extreme, the Puritan.
[time=1955] Not that I am accusing our founding fathers, but there's a puritanical view of sex which says, "Sex is a four-letter word."
[time=1963] Well, I failed the third grade, and I know that's not true. It's a three-letter word.
[time=1967] But there's this view that to talk about sex is wrong. Our bodies are dirty. Sex is bad.
[time=1975] And the only reason why God ever created sex was so there would be babies.
[time=1979] And now that the world's crowded, there probably is no need for sex.
[time=1984] Well, just as the Playboy view is wrong and it's out of balance in its extreme permissiveness, so the Puritan view is equally as wrong and out of balance on the other extreme.
[time=1994] God has designed us physically. He has designed us sexually.
[time=1998] And when he created the world after his first creative act, he said, "That's good." And he created a little more, and he said, "That's good." And he created a little bit more, and he said, "That's good." And at the end of it all, he looked at it and he said, "That's very good." And as he made us physically, sexually, he said that all that he made was good.
[time=2020] He created sex and declared everything, it was so facto, as good.
[time=2024] As a matter of fact, the first time that God ever said it is not good was Genesis 2, when he said,
[time=2030] "It is not good that man should be alone. Therefore, I will create him a partner, a helpmate, someone designed to be partners together in life."
[time=2039] The Bible, to be quite honest, speaks very candidly, very descriptively of sexual relationships,
[time=2048] and says that marriage is a bond of which sex is a part, and it is to be treasured and enjoyed in that context.
[time=2058] How many of you have heard a 13-message series on the Song of Solomon lately?
[time=2064] Well, that's pretty explicit stuff.
[time=2068] I was considering today I just found that in Proverb 5, there are some good insights from Solomon to his sons.
[time=2076] I was going to read those, but I thought, "Well, this Sunday morning, we have a little more sophisticated in this, because it's pretty blunt."
[time=2082] And it's on both extremes.
[time=2084] He warns his sons about following the strange woman, meaning someone other than the wife of his youth.
[time=2091] He talks very openly about how that whole system of enticement goes.
[time=2096] But then in the later verses, he says, "To enjoy the wife of thy youth, and boy, it becomes descriptive."
[time=2102] I hate to say it, but God's not a Puritan.
[time=2105] You're not a playboy either.
[time=2108] In the middle ground, there's a proper view of sex.
[time=2111] The God says, "I've made it, and I've designed it, and it's for you, and when you obey my design, you'll find fulfillment in life."
[time=2122] Several times this past year, I had been asked a question I'd never been asked before.
[time=2129] By Christians, really honestly seeking to obey the Lord, the question went like this, and it was more than once.
[time=2138] I know that the Bible says that premarital sex is wrong.
[time=2144] I accept that, but Rick, why?
[time=2148] What's wrong with it?
[time=2150] Turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians, chapter 6, and verses 12 through the end of the chapter.
[time=2157] And I believe here, God gives us five reasons to remain pure.
[time=2165] Verse 12, "All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.
[time=2172] All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
[time=2180] Foods for the body and the body for foods, but God shall destroy both it and them.
[time=2188] The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord and the Lord for the body.
[time=2197] And God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power.
[time=2205] Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?
[time=2209] Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot?
[time=2215] God forbid, what?
[time=2219] Know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body, for the two shall be one flesh.
[time=2227] But the he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit, flee fornication.
[time=2234] Every sin that a man doeth is outside the body, but he the committed fornication sineth against his own soul
[time=2243] and his own body.
[time=2245] What?
[time=2246] Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have of God
[time=2252] and you are not your own.
[time=2254] You have been bought with a price.
[time=2256] Therefore glorify God in your spirit, which are gods?
[time=2261] Your body and your spirit, which are gods?
[time=2264] Here I believe God outlines for us a proper view of sex.
[time=2270] And why wait? Or if you're married, why remain faithful?
[time=2274] Last week we looked at two statements. Let me repeat those as I give to you five.
[time=2279] Two of them are by way of review.
[time=2281] First of all, God says that to engage in extramarital sex, be it primarily or breaking of the marriage bond,
[time=2289] God says that it's a violation of his standards.
[time=2292] He says although the Old Testament law, it's dietary regulations, it's ceremony, may be passed and we're free from the law of tradition.
[time=2302] There is still an ethic that God would honor. It's the ethic of purity.
[time=2305] He says flee fornication. It would be a violation of his standards.
[time=2309] But secondly, sex is a cheap substitute for the real thing.
[time=2315] There were those who thought their body was a toy. They used it to get anything that they could get
[time=2321] with their body. But God says your body is not for fornication.
[time=2326] Your body is for the Lord and the Lord for your body.
[time=2329] And we live in a time today, beloved, where we often settle for cheap substitutes.
[time=2338] Most people who engage in extramarital sexual relationships do them for non-sexual purposes.
[time=2349] You see, God can give us purpose for living. God can give us direction in life.
[time=2357] God can give us a sense of self-worth. God can give us a sense of love and being loved.
[time=2363] God can give us a sense of acceptability.
[time=2367] But the danger is that when we don't feel love, we don't feel acceptability.
[time=2372] We don't feel worth that we go out and we try to look for it.
[time=2376] And society says, "If you'll give me what I want, then I will love you.
[time=2381] If you will do what I want, then I will accept you." And so we're a generation of people that think that sex will give us what only God can give us.
[time=2393] Sex can never give you direction in life.
[time=2396] Although he says or she says, "If you will, I'll stay." There's no guarantee that they'll stay. Only God can satisfy those deep interpersonal needs
[time=2409] that we're constantly trying to purchase through the avenues of sex, some new principles.
[time=2418] Verse 15 says, "No, you not, that your bodies are the members of Christ.
[time=2424] Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot?" Now, the emphasis on this passage is on prostitution.
[time=2432] That's because in Corinth, there were over 1,000 prostitutes who nightly came from the temple of Aphrodite into the cities to solicit the involvement sexually of the citizenry.
[time=2445] That was their most prevalent form of immorality.
[time=2449] But it's speaking of immorality, not just prostitution.
[time=2453] Don't say, "This passage doesn't apply to myself and my secretary.
[time=2456] This passage doesn't apply to me and my neighbor's wife.
[time=2459] This passage doesn't apply to me and that handsome guy that teaches tennis.
[time=2464] This passage applies." And now the third principle is this.
[time=2470] When we engage ourselves in sexual relationships outside of marriage, it pollutes the image of Christ.
[time=2478] You see, the Bible teaches that the day we come to Christ as Savior, that we become members of His body.
[time=2486] We belong to Him, and He belongs to us.
[time=2490] We are in Him, and He is in us.
[time=2493] That there is not a metaphysical separation between Christ and the body of Christ, each one of us who have been born again.
[time=2503] Do you remember as a child singing a song that went like this, and I give you only the words, not the tune?
[time=2510] Be careful, little mouth, what you say.
[time=2518] Because the Father up above is looking down in love, so be careful, little mouth, what you say.
[time=2525] Oh, be careful, little feet, where you go.
[time=2531] For the Father up above is looking down in love.
[time=2535] Oh, be careful, little feet, where you go.
[time=2538] That's a good song. We need to teach it to our children, but you know, it's only a partial concept.
[time=2544] This doesn't rhyme, but perhaps it should say, be careful, big feet, where you go.
[time=2552] Oh, be careful, big feet, where you go, because the Son lives within, and He goes where you go.
[time=2562] Be careful, big mouth, what you say.
[time=2568] Oh, be careful, big mouth, what you say, because the Son lives within, and He's there when you say it.
[time=2576] You see, there is no separation between Christ and His Church.
[time=2582] He is in you, you are in Him, and whatever you do, you are committing and linking your partner to.
[time=2593] We have several charge accounts.
[time=2596] If I go into one of the fine department stores like Pennies and Sears, since we have deacons who are managers of both, we have to give equal time here.
[time=2607] And I walk in, and I take out my charge account, and I charge something. You know what I did?
[time=2613] I didn't just obligate myself to pay for that.
[time=2615] I obligated Kathy to pay for that.
[time=2619] And if Kathy goes into a store and charges, she doesn't simply obligate herself to pay for that.
[time=2625] I am her partner. I am obligated to pay for that.
[time=2630] And so, as partners with Christ and members of His body, whatever we do, we link Christ to that.
[time=2641] I think what Jesus is saying here is, partner, don't commit us to immorality.
[time=2648] You are dragging me into this.
[time=2651] You are obligating me. You are taking my image that I have entrusted to you, and this is how you are marring it.
[time=2661] Why remain pure and faithful?
[time=2666] Because we are members of Christ's body.
[time=2669] Otherwise, pollutes the image of Christ.
[time=2673] Principle number four is this one.
[time=2677] To break purity, or to break faithfulness, is a violation of the process of marital bonding.
[time=2686] Look at these verses, verse 16.
[time=2689] What? Don't you know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body, for the two, sayeth thee, that's the Lord, shall be one flesh.
[time=2700] When God created an Adam and Eve, He said that when you bring your relationship to the culmination sexually, you are bonding yourself to one another.
[time=2713] In life, there is a process of bonding.
[time=2716] There is bonding between parents and children.
[time=2719] There are bondings that take place between friendships, and there is a most intimate bonding that takes place between a husband and a wife.
[time=2729] Much of the divorce in our society happens because there has never been proper and complete bonding between the married couples.
[time=2739] Desmond Morse, who is not a believer to my knowledge, has written an excellent book, and it's been taken by Christian wise thinkers and brought into our language and our understanding.
[time=2751] It's the study of bonding both in the animal and in human life, and the process by which lives are drawn together.
[time=2759] Many of us have violated that bonding process, and so there's strain in our marriage, or there's divorce in our marriage, or there's no trust in our marriage, or there's no intimacy in our marriage, because the bonding hasn't taken place.
[time=2775] Allow me just to give you a glimpse of what has been observed by anthropologist.
[time=2779] Morse gives 12 steps to complete and perfect bonding.
[time=2784] Let me give those to you.
[time=2787] Step one is I to body.
[time=2790] Now that's not meaning the body sexually, just I to body.
[time=2793] There was a time about 10 or 11 years ago when my eye noticed a cute girl named Cathy.
[time=2800] She noticed me, and our eyes began to observe the other person.
[time=2807] We observed character traits, we observed physical qualities, we observed interest.
[time=2813] She is deathly afraid of animals, but to spend time together on the first time we spend any time together, she went horseback riding with me.
[time=2822] It was one of the greatest joys of her life.
[time=2825] But it was just simply observation.
[time=2827] She said that's his interest, and it was the first step to bonding.
[time=2830] You know, I went to musicals with her.
[time=2833] She had sit there and say, "Ooh, wasn't that obo good?" I didn't hear any obo.
[time=2838] (Laughter) You know, that was that I to body.
[time=2842] That was her life to my life.
[time=2845] We were coming together.
[time=2847] And that was just this cordial, casual dating relationship.
[time=2852] Sometimes it's not even a date.
[time=2854] It's simple observation.
[time=2855] But there comes a second progression in the bonding.
[time=2858] It's I to I.
[time=2860] Oh, you can look I to I.
[time=2861] I see one of my friends right now, and we can talk I to I.
[time=2864] But can we probably won't sit there just across the table and look I to I for an hour or two?
[time=2869] Neither one of us would be very comfortable with that.
[time=2872] Now, we can look I to I, and that's a good way to talk.
[time=2875] But there comes a bonding that takes place with a young couple.
[time=2878] They don't have to be young.
[time=2879] I don't know why I said that.
[time=2881] But as a couple, sit down and they look I to I.
[time=2883] You know, have you ever noticed that couples can sit I to I and not say anything for the longest time?
[time=2889] What do they do?
[time=2890] They're looking into the windows of the soul.
[time=2892] And that's a next step in bonding I to I.
[time=2895] Then there's voice to voice.
[time=2898] That's when you now begin to express secrets.
[time=2902] I told Kathy things that I wasn't comfortable telling other people.
[time=2907] I was going through a process of self revelation.
[time=2911] She was going through that same thing.
[time=2913] We began to talk at an intimate level.
[time=2916] Voice to voice.
[time=2918] Well, then there comes another step.
[time=2921] Hand to hand.
[time=2923] That's not simply the hormones bubbling over and saying I must touch you.
[time=2927] It is simply saying there is now a level of intimacy that I want to be near you and I want to feel your presence.
[time=2933] I want to link myself with you.
[time=2936] You know, that's not only true between a married or a dating couple.
[time=2940] There are many times that I'll be visiting someone in a hospital.
[time=2943] And we'll say let's pray together and we'll both reach out our hands to pray.
[time=2948] There's no power that flows through these hands.
[time=2951] North through theirs, but it's simply bonding ourselves together in prayer.
[time=2955] Hand to hand.
[time=2957] Well, then there's a next step that proceeds.
[time=2959] It's the step of arm to shoulder.
[time=2962] And again, it's not so much the sexual awareness of a different body, but it's simply standing side by side, linking ourselves together, not facing each other, but facing a world together.
[time=2974] Well, there are 12 steps.
[time=2976] The 12th step as you progress into intimacy is the bonding that takes place through the relationship of sexual expression.
[time=2985] Now, what we're saying here beloved is this.
[time=2988] These two things.
[time=2990] First of all, to become involved sexually before marriage
[time=2996] and through this bonding process will disrupt your life in a devastating way.
[time=3004] Do you know that most of the people who are struggling with sexual dysfunction are struggling with no physical problems at all?
[time=3011] It is all emotional and interpersonal, and it's because their bonding has not taken place properly.
[time=3018] They've experimented with sex, they enjoyed it as a toy, but now it has lost its value and there's no function because the bonding didn't take place.
[time=3029] The second principle is this.
[time=3032] Whenever you engage in sex with another purpose, you are psychologically binding yourself poorly, improperly,
[time=3041] but there's a bond that takes place.
[time=3045] The Bible saying God's created us, and He's designed us to be bound together.
[time=3051] For this cause shall a man leave his mother and father and shall join that's being bonded to his wife.
[time=3057] And the sex that God has given us is a part of that and is the crescendo.
[time=3063] And now He says this.
[time=3065] If you engage in extramarital sexual relationships, you're violating the bonding process that God has created and it will have devastating consequences on your life.
[time=3077] And He says you're not only to be bound to your wife and not be bound to every other person who you find sexually appealing, but you're not only physically bonded to your wife, but God says you and I are bonded together spiritually.
[time=3091] God says you and I have a bond and that bond supersedes every other bond.
[time=3096] You're bound to me spiritually.
[time=3100] Trust is there between a husband and wife because they're tied together and there's nothing more devastating than broken trust.
[time=3110] God says I'm trusting you and we're bound together spiritually.
[time=3115] Therefore He makes this imperative, flee fornication.
[time=3120] Flee fornication.
[time=3124] Beloved, if we are going to remain pure or faithful in these days, it's going to require good feet.
[time=3132] We're going to have to be good runners like Joseph.
[time=3136] You see, men will always be a potter for his wife somewhere.
[time=3140] There will always be someone who will make an advance to you.
[time=3145] Ladies, there will always be a David, someone who will find you attractive.
[time=3152] What will you do?
[time=3154] Oh, be like a Joseph.
[time=3156] Decide today that you will flee.
[time=3160] When Potiphar's wife came to Joseph and tried to seduce him, he avoided her.
[time=3166] He said no, he refused to be with her and when she was in the east part of the house, he made sure he was in the west.
[time=3172] But obviously lives had to cross paths and there came a day when he was physically within reach and she grabbed and said today, sleep with me today.
[time=3181] And he said no when he ran.
[time=3184] Flee it.
[time=3186] If you're an alcoholic, it probably doesn't serve you well to go talk to your friends at the bar.
[time=3192] If you are covetous and materialistic, you probably shouldn't spend your Saturdays roaming Glenbrook Mall or reading the tabloids that come in the mail.
[time=3204] If you struggle in an area, you must avoid it.
[time=3208] Purity has to be avoided or purity has to be maintained by avoiding every avenue of temptation.
[time=3215] He says flee it.
[time=3217] And then he reasons this way.
[time=3219] He said every sin that a man does is outside the body.
[time=3223] But he the committed fornication sins against his own body.
[time=3227] What he is saying there is that if you take the Ten Commandments, don't lie, don't steal, don't kill, that all is wrong and has devastating consequences.
[time=3236] But when you commit fornication, you're destroying your own body in a number of ways.
[time=3243] Well obviously there is what we now call STDs.
[time=3249] STDs sexually transmitted disease.
[time=3254] You say all that won't happen to me.
[time=3256] I don't know whether it will happen to you or not.
[time=3259] But that's one of the consequences that is lurking out there.
[time=3264] But there's another consequence that you, by your extramarital involvements and breaking of purity
[time=3271] and of faithfulness, will discover that you will have an emotional consequence of guilt
[time=3279] that will have a physical consequence in your life.
[time=3284] This is disregard for the body that God has given us.
[time=3289] And whenever we misuse something, it's only a short period of time before we then abuse it.
[time=3296] Have you ever noticed the progression of different articles of clothing in your house?
[time=3300] Favorite shirts.
[time=3301] This is one of my favorite shirts.
[time=3303] It has the spots for the cufflinks.
[time=3305] I don't wear this shirt except we're on good occasions, church meetings and things like that.
[time=3311] This is one of my favorites.
[time=3312] I take care of it.
[time=3313] I have another shirt a lot like it that used to be my favorite shirt, but it got old and it got frayed.
[time=3319] And so it was no longer special.
[time=3322] So then I started to misuse it.
[time=3324] I started to use it for other purposes than just the more formal occasions.
[time=3330] And the more I misused it, the worse it got.
[time=3333] To the point now where it is one of the best rags I've got.
[time=3337] You can dust with it.
[time=3339] It's cut up into little pieces, I can stain furniture with it.
[time=3343] It goes from special to casual to misuse to abuse.
[time=3350] That is exactly the path you will head down with your bodies.
[time=3354] It goes from special.
[time=3356] God's designed me sexually and it's pure within marriage to casual.
[time=3361] That's my body, I can play a little here, play a little there to misuse to abuse.
[time=3369] And you know the trends in our society today are sadomasochistic.
[time=3375] That means for me to enjoy sex it has to hurt you.
[time=3379] And would you really make this sex special by hurting me?
[time=3384] That's the rave today.
[time=3388] Because you see once we take that which is special and make it casual, we take that which is casual and we use it inappropriately and then it comes to the point of abuse.
[time=3398] We're a nation today abusing our bodies because we violated God's standards.
[time=3404] Someone says, "My body, I'll do what I want." No, it's not your body.
[time=3409] Look at verses 19 and 20.
[time=3410] What?
[time=3411] Don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
[time=3417] who is in you, whom you have from God?
[time=3420] Note this phrase, "And you are not your own." You don't own anything in life including your own flesh and blood.
[time=3429] It belongs to God and He's got two titles of claim.
[time=3433] First He's got the title of claim because He created you and He didn't create you for you.
[time=3437] He created you for Him.
[time=3439] That's what Revelation 4-11 says, "All things were created by God and we were created for Him
[time=3445] and for His pleasure." God didn't create me to have pleasure, He created me to be an object through which He would have pleasure.
[time=3452] And you know the amazing paradox in life, if I live for my pleasure I never find it and if I live for His pleasure I find pleasure.
[time=3461] It's a paradox of life Jesus taught it.
[time=3464] You belong to Him secondly, not only by creation but by the new birth.
[time=3469] It says you've been bought with a price.
[time=3471] Jesus Christ died for you, for your soul, for your spirit, for your emotions and for your body and it belongs to Him.
[time=3479] He owns you, would you honor Him?
