[time=93] [MUSIC - 159 seconds]
[time=266] Thank you, you may be seated. It is a privilege for me to welcome you today to
[time=274] our second morning worship service. In the last hour we met, we sang together, we studied the scriptures, we heard music, and my heart came away encouraged, and I
[time=285] trust this morning that as we worship together God will do the same in years that they'll come a spirit of refreshment, that as we worship Him we ourselves find the joy of knowing the very purpose for which God created us.
[time=299] Welcome this morning. We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us today for the Bible Hour. We sincerely pray that God will use the Ministry of Television in their lives just as well. The reason why we meet this morning is because God loves us, and He loves us so much that He sent His Son the Lord
[time=318] Jesus Christ, and that He came, and He came to love us.
[time=348] We came to serve us, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give,
[time=732] I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I
[time=732] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 881 seconds] I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I give, what can I...
[time=1632] Thank you, Peter. He is the King of Kings, and evermore, the same. Lord Jesus, we praise
[time=1650] you today for your character that is so different than each of us. You are the same. You're
[time=1659] always the same, so dependable, so faithful. And we've come to worship you today as the
[time=1669] King of Kings and Lord of Lords, but most of all, Lord, as our King, our Lord. And Father,
[time=1679] we've come today to worship you and to praise your name. We sense today that the very purpose
[time=1685] of our being is to worship you. And so, Father, we've come at this special moment to do that
[time=1691] which we endeavor to do minute by minute and day by day. That is to ascribe all glory,
[time=1698] majesty, and honor to you. We glory in you and not in ourselves. So, Father, today, we
[time=1705] pray that in these moments of study of your word that you would be magnified and glorified,
[time=1712] and pray that by your spirit you would make the word come alive in each of our hearts.
[time=1719] God, today, I sense my own inadequacy, that I am just one of us, and we need to hear from
[time=1726] you. So, Father, today, I pray even from my lips that you would be the one who would
[time=1732] guide them, that your word which has been written infallible for history would be fresh
[time=1739] and alive. We pray that it would give comfort to hearts today. We pray for Mary, for Judy,
[time=1748] new spawn, for Bill, and for Marv, for Ralph, and for others who battle chronic health.
[time=1757] Father, we pray for the Bailey's and the Culp's. As they grab ahold of something that most
[time=1769] of us have not yet had to handle, the depth of hurt, the loss of a partner, a loved one
[time=1777] in life. Father, we pray as the God of all comfort, your hand would be upon these. Father,
[time=1784] we pray today for those whose lives are in turmoil as they wrestle with decisions. Father, many
[time=1790] of us today are uncertain as to the next move that we should make in our marriages, our
[time=1797] dating life, our careers, our parenting, our college program. God, we pray that you would
[time=1805] give us a word of direction today. Father, we pray today that your word would melt us together.
[time=1815] We pray that this body of people, of which I am privileged to be a part, might ever grow in its love, one for another. Father, we pray that you'll break down any barriers that may exist between those who possess much and those who seemingly have little. Father, make
[time=1833] us a transparent, flowing group of people who embrace each other regardless of our possessions.
[time=1841] Help those who are of less means to smile upon your blessing on a brother or sister.
[time=1848] Help those who possess more to be discreet and to honor those who have less. Father, we
[time=1856] would pray that you would break down barriers between black and white or any races, make of us one body. Father, we pray that you would break down any barriers between those of us
[time=1867] who have called this land home for generations and those of us who have only been on this
[time=1874] soil a short number of years, make of us one in Christ. Father, make of us one in Christ.
[time=1882] Those who are single who have never married and those who have a house full of people
[time=1890] or those who have been divorced or windowed, God blend us together. We pray for those who
[time=1897] are single again. Some have felt the sting of rejection. Others have felt the sting of
[time=1904] death. We pray for Bob Weimer, for Connie Wills, Joyce Schindler. Pray for the Lee family.
[time=1922] Father, we today don't know the depth of hurt, but you do. When you gave up your son, the
[time=1930] Lord Jesus, so it's in his name that we come with our hearts open to your word, asking
[time=1936] you today to minister to each of us. In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1944] If you have your Bible with you this morning, I would like to ask you to open it to the book of 1 Corinthians. If you're visiting with us this morning, we do hope that you feel our sense of welcomeness towards you. If you're not familiar with our form of worship, we
[time=1959] are a church that believes that God has given us his word and that it is authoritative and that it can give direction to life today. So we study it. We invite you to open your
[time=1971] Bible and study with us. If you see someone near you who doesn't have a Bible, please do share yours with them that we can study the Word of God.
[time=1980] 1 Corinthians 7 verses 1 through 9. Now concerning the things about which you wrote unto me,
[time=1991] it is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every
[time=1999] man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render
[time=2008] unto the wife or do, and likewise also the wife unto her husband. The wife hath not power
[time=2016] over her own body, but the husband, and likewise the husband hath not power over his own body,
[time=2023] but the wife. Defraud not ye one another, except to be with consent for a time that you
[time=2032] may be able to give yourselves to fasting and to prayer. And come together again that
[time=2039] Satan tempt you not for your inconsistency, but I speak this by permission and not by
[time=2047] commandment, for I would that all men were even as I myself, but every man hath this proper
[time=2054] gift of God, one after this manner and another after that. I say, therefore, to the unmarried
[time=2061] and widows it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot have self-control,
[time=2073] let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn. This passage of Scripture marks a
[time=2080] change in the book of 1 Corinthians in the type of writing the apostle Paul was doing.
[time=2087] The first part of the book Paul was reacting to a report that he got. After a few introductory
[time=2093] verses he says, "I have heard from Chloe and his household that there are divisions
[time=2099] among you." Chloe apparently was someone who felt a closeness to the apostle Paul and somehow
[time=2105] communicated to Paul there were some problems. If you will, he snitched or narked on the
[time=2111] Corinthians. He let Paul know how bad it was. Perhaps he sent a letter. We know that three
[time=2117] men brought some information to Paul, their names Staphonus, Fortuneatus, and Archicus.
[time=2123] You say, "I have never heard of those guys before." If you read the last chapters of the epistles you will meet a lot of unusual, godly people. Those three men came from Corinth to Paul and brought him the word that was probably originating in the house of Chloe.
[time=2140] And so for the first six chapters Paul is basically saying, "Man, I can't believe this, but I heard this about you guys. I heard you're fighting over the rich verses, the poor, the wise verses, those who aren't so wise. I heard that you're suing each other. I even
[time=2156] heard that there is a man who's living with his stepmother immorally. And so Paul has been correcting all of the problems he's heard about. But now in chapter 7 verse 1 he changes.
[time=2167] He says, "Now concerning the things that you've written unto me, obviously a letter has gone
[time=2174] from Corinth to Paul and he's now giving a response to their questions. The words now
[time=2180] concerning, or about this, occur several more times than the rest of Corinthians. It's right
[time=2187] here in chapter 7 where he talks about four very, very practical subjects. Singleness,
[time=2193] marriage, divorce, and sex. Do you know anybody who's not interested in that list? Pretty practical
[time=2201] stuff, isn't it? Well the next time it occurs it's in chapter 8 verse 1 when he says these
[time=2207] words right here. "Now concerning are as touching things off for titles. We might say now concerning
[time=2214] those gray areas where the Bible doesn't say thou shall or thou shall not." How do you
[time=2222] handle those things? Things like this. Well is it alright to go to a football game? Well
[time=2228] sure it's alright to go to a football game. Well what if it's on a Sunday? Well I don't know. Well what if it's on Sunday while church is going on? Well I don't know. Well what if it's on Sunday while church is going on into the Super Bowl? Play 6, stay home and watch it on TV, right? You know how do you handle those gray areas? You know I can't stand before you today and say, "Now shall go to church every Sunday night." It's right there in Hawks chapter 2 verse 13. I know it's important to worship the Lord. How do you handle those?
[time=2258] I don't know anybody that's not interested in those gray areas. Pretty practical stuff.
[time=2264] This now concerning appears again in chapter 12 verse 1. It's about spiritual gifts this
[time=2271] time. One man did a message on this chapter and he said to speak or not to speak. That is the question. Do you speak in tongues or don't you speak in tongues? Well if you speak
[time=2282] in tongues, should you speak in tongues in a church? They used to speak in tongues. Why don't we speak in tongues? Is speaking in tongues the only gift? Do you have to have speaking tongues to be saved? The answer is yes, no, maybe no, no and yes. Well I don't
[time=2295] know anybody that really doesn't want to know what the answer to some of those questions happen to be. It's practical stuff. The phrase occurs again in chapter 16 and it's talking
[time=2307] about money. Nobody's interested in that so we'll move back to chapter 7. You see what Paul's doing now, he's answering their questions but what I find so fascinating is if you and
[time=2318] I sat down with a list and listed all five or ten things that we said were the most relevant concerns today, wouldn't there be a significant overlap to what 1 Corinthians all about? God's word is fresh. We often think that times change, they don't change all that much, we just go
[time=2335] through cycles and we seem to keep coming around the same checkpoints again and again and we're looking at amongst those checkpoints for a reference point and I believe it's in
[time=2346] God's word. Today we've read verses one through nine and it talks about these four things,
[time=2354] singleness, marriage, divorce, and sex. It's going to take a number of weeks to cover chapter
[time=2362] seven as it addresses each of these topics but today from the passage we've just read I would like to share what I believe are the four points that leap out of the pages and that grab me and I hope they grab you. Principle number one is this from verse one. It is this
[time=2380] principle, singleness is noble. Verse one says this, "Now concerning the things which you
[time=2390] have written unto me," and his answer, "it is good that a man not touch a woman." Wow,
[time=2401] that's pretty strict stuff if you take that literally word for word. In fact when we were greeting people earlier I shook a number of ladies hands. I need to formally apologize
[time=2412] to you and to you and to you and to you. I didn't realize that I shouldn't have been touching you. Is that really what it's saying? You say, "Oh come on, there's got to be a little bit better insight than that." Sure there is. The phrase to touch a woman is actually
[time=2426] a euphemism. Are you familiar with that English device, a euphemism? A euphemism is you say
[time=2432] one thing that has an obvious second meaning so as to perhaps hide the harshness. For example,
[time=2441] we often will say when someone dies that they have fallen asleep in the Lord. That's first
[time=2448] Corinthians chapter 11. That doesn't mean that they're sleeping. That actually means that their body has ceased this life and has gone to heaven. We talk about sleep and death.
[time=2458] It means one for another. Tragically the abortionists in our society have grabbed a hold of this
[time=2464] device to hide the harsh reality of what they're doing. They talk about an abortion and they
[time=2472] call it the removal of fetal tissue. Tissue sounds so appropriate to be removed. A euphemism
[time=2483] is a way of saying one thing when it's obvious that you really mean another. The euphemism to touch a woman actually means to have full sexual relationships. Well how do I know that?
[time=2494] Well it's obvious I doubt that many are debating it but here's the insight. Proverbs chapter 9 verse 29 says this, "So is he who sleeps with another man's wife. No one who touches
[time=2506] her shall be innocent." Here's what Paul is saying and the new international version
[time=2513] makes it simple and clear. He is saying this, "It is good not to marry." Now please this
[time=2521] is not a put down on marriage but catch this first principle right up front. Paul is saying
[time=2528] principle number one, singleness is noble. According to historians the Jewish world at
[time=2536] this time said that it was a tragedy and a grave sin for a man not to marry and an equally
[time=2545] grave sin for him not to raise up children. For you see in Genesis chapter 1 in verse
[time=2552] 28 God said be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth and the Jews took that as a strict
[time=2561] commandment and so did not marry and to raise up children was disobedience and they prohibited
[time=2569] a man from remaining single and there was great social pressure to marry. Now Paul is
[time=2576] speaking to the church of Jesus Christ and is that mindset appropriate? Is he saying
[time=2583] everyone should get married and he says absolutely not. Singleness is a noble, noble calling.
[time=2596] I know Genesis chapter 1 verse 28 says to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth
[time=2604] but beloved none of us need to take that as a personal challenge. That was given to the
[time=2610] human race not to Adam and Eve or anyone couple. John MacArthur spoke here about four or five
[time=2617] years ago and said statistics show that there's a woman in the world giving birth to a child every eleven seconds and it's someone should find the woman and put a stop to it. What's
[time=2629] the Bible saying? It's saying yes God has made us and he's made us with capabilities to reproduce and it's a desire that we have children but beloved the world's full and
[time=2640] if you don't marry or have children you're not disobeying God. Singleness is a noble, noble calling. As a matter of fact the Apostle Paul finds it preferable. Let me just slide
[time=2652] down a few verses and you'll come to this statement in verse 6 he says but I speak this
[time=2658] by permission and not by commandment. Now that statement means this. He's saying I'm not commanding you to be single and you to get married and you to get married and you to stay single. He's saying no as a general rule I'm saying that there's a great value in remaining
[time=2674] single but I'm not commanding anybody that they have to be single. It's not a commandment.
[time=2682] It's not a point of spiritual superiority that you're married or that you're not married.
[time=2686] He simply says my encouragement to you. My permission of God is to say singleness is a noble calling and he goes on to elevate it. He says these words for I would that all men
[time=2698] were even as I myself. Well is he single or is he married? Let's read on. But to every
[time=2704] man he has a proper gift one after this manner and another after that. I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows it is good for them if they abide even as I. Paul is saying
[time=2715] I'm unmarried and my advice to you is if you can handle it stay unmarried. Now that's a
[time=2724] rather interesting dilemma. Paul says here that he is unmarried. Something has happened
[time=2730] because Paul was married at one point. How do we know that? Well to be a Pharisee and
[time=2736] to be a member of the Sanhedrin which Paul was the law required that you were married.
[time=2742] Or Paul is either widowed possibly or separated possibly or divorced possibly. Now some of
[time=2758] you are probably already finding smoke coming out from under your collar that someone would
[time=2764] even suggest that the apostle Paul was separated or divorced. I'm certainly not saying that he was but I'm saying this Paul was married and now Paul is single again. We don't know
[time=2775] whether he was widowed or it was separation or divorce but it's obvious that the next
[time=2781] thing that he talks about are those who were unbelievers and were married and one of them
[time=2787] becomes a believer and the other one says when I married you you were a nice Jewish boy or a nice pagan boy and then you went and accepted Christ and ruined our whole plan. He may have
[time=2799] been talking about himself. We don't know that but we know this. Paul was saying I'm
[time=2805] single again and he's saying I wish many of you could stay just like me single. He says
[time=2812] it's an honorable calling even a gift from God. Now let me draw some practical advice
[time=2820] out of that. Please let's not put pressure on single people to get married. Let's not
[time=2831] do that. Do you know most single people are far more comfortable with their singleness
[time=2838] than their married friends? It's their married friends that can't handle that just because
[time=2844] someone's a senior in college and school that's out in three weeks does not mean that there has to be an engagement. There isn't anything wrong as a matter of fact there's a lot right
[time=2856] with being single. If your son or daughter is of age plus a few years and they're still
[time=2864] not married that may be God's calling for their life. Don't pressure them into doing
[time=2870] something that God may be calling them to do just the opposite just because all of your friends kids are married by now. Don't pressure them. Could be exactly what God wants them
[time=2882] to do. And then of course, of course this. We as a church, not just Blackhawk, the church
[time=2891] but of course it includes Blackhawk, have got to break down the barriers between single
[time=2897] and married. Sometimes churches help and sometimes they hurt. One particular group had the insensitivity
[time=2904] to call their Sunday school class "pairs and spares." Beloved, a single person is not
[time=2911] a spare. They're not an extra. Can you believe that? There is a group that have called them
[time=2917] themselves that name. That's why there have been books written like one is a whole number.
[time=2923] If you're single, you're a person and you have as much worth as any of us who are married
[time=2929] and you're as much a part of this church and in many, many times more so. More so. Because
[time=2936] you by your singleness have a unique calendar. And that calendar is free from responsibilities
[time=2946] that are often time consuming with a partner and children and that time can often be given to the Lord. And this church is the beneficiary of many, many single people who do more than
[time=2957] those of us who are married because they have that extra time. And instead of using it for themselves, they use it for the body and they serve the Lord. First principle is this. Singleness
[time=2971] is a noble, noble calling. Second principle is this and we've just gone through the G
[time=2981] section. Now we're moving into the PG section. Verse two says this. "Never the last to avoid
[time=2988] fornication, that's immorality. Let every man have his own wife and let every wife have
[time=2995] her own husband." Principle number two is this. Marriage is also honorable. Don't sit there
[time=3003] saying, "Oh my goodness, you mean if I were to stay single, I would have been in a better state and more pleasing and available to God, not necessarily so." Marriage is also appropriate.
[time=3015] Look back down. It says this in verse seven. Paul said, "I would that all men were even as I, but every man hath his proper gift one after this manner and another after that."
[time=3026] God says, "To some I gave the gift of being single and content, but to this one I gave the gift of being married and having a partner and both are pleasing to God." But now he
[time=3039] makes this rather bold statement. He said, "There's a lot of immorality out there folks."
[time=3047] Paul said, "I've been to Corinth. I've seen the night lights. I've seen the torches as they come down off the ark of Corinth and I've heard the call of the priestess prostitutes.
[time=3057] Hey, it's tough being pure." Paul said, "If you can't handle it, get married." I mean,
[time=3065] he's exceedingly blunt, not only in verse two, but look at the last phrase in verse nine.
[time=3071] He says this, "If you can't have self-control, let them marry because it's better to marry
[time=3078] than to burn." Now that burn, what does that mean? I don't think that means that if you're
[time=3084] sexually unfaithful, that you're going to go to hell and burn forever. If Christ didn't
[time=3090] come into your heart and you weren't forgiven, you would, but that sin can be forgiven like all others. But what he's saying here, "It's better to marry than to burn with passion
[time=3101] out of control." It's amazing how many of the secular songs talk about burning, being
[time=3110] on fire, passion out of control. Their voice is calling us, the immorality. God says marriage
[time=3122] may be a better option. Now don't misunderstand this. Paul is not saying here, the only reason
[time=3129] to get married is to have a normal sexual relationship fulfilled. That's not what he's
[time=3136] saying at all. He's not developing a full theology of marriage. He says a great deal
[time=3143] about the other dimensions of marriage in places like 1 Corinthians 13 and Ephesians chapter 5. But here he's just coming to the cold, hard facts that purity is a priority
[time=3154] to God. And tragically, there are many people who on the one hand pat themselves on the
[time=3161] back that they've remained single, and on the other hand, are sexually immoral. And God
[time=3168] says no, there's no value to that singleness at all. Purity is a priority. He's simply
[time=3176] stating here that marriage is also honorable. Hebrews 13, marriage is honorable amongst all.
[time=3187] Article number three, we've covered the G in the PG verses, now we have the PG 13 verses.
[time=3196] Verses three, four, and five give us this next general principle. Sex within marriage is
[time=3204] totally appropriate. And he makes about four different statements. Statement number one
[time=3211] is this, we are responsible as married couples to meet each other's sexual needs. Pretty blunt.
[time=3221] Verse three says this, let the husband render under the wife, it's called her Dubenevolence
[time=3227] in the original language. But he's saying, give yourselves men sexually to your wife.
[time=3233] And then he turns around and says to the wives, give yourselves sexually to your husband. But notice it says, let the husband render. That means give. You notice it never says take.
[time=3244] It only says give. But as married partners, we are to give ourselves to each other freely
[time=3251] and openly. Statement number two, the wife does not have power or control over her own
[time=3259] body. Nor does the husband have control over his body, but they through marriage have committed
[time=3266] themselves to each other. And they belong to each other. And the man no longer has the
[time=3272] autonomous use of his body. That body bit ever so humble or shabby belongs to her, man.
[time=3282] She has to say so. And wives your body doesn't simply belong to you anymore. He has a say
[time=3289] so in that. We own each other. We're partners. We cannot say this is my body. I do not want
[time=3297] this. I want that. Give me this. Don't give me. God says no. Your bodies belong to each other. A third statement under this principle is this. To withhold sexual expression from
[time=3308] each other is a form of robbery. Verse five says defraud not one another. That same word
[time=3316] defraud here in chapter five occurs in chapter six when it says these statements. Now therefore
[time=3324] it is utterly a fault among you because you go to law with one another. Why not rather
[time=3330] be wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded? It's a courtroom scene. He's
[time=3339] saying rather than me sue a brother who has taken something that belongs to me, why not let him get away with the rip off? Means the steal to rob. Now he takes that same word
[time=3351] and says if partners within marriage withhold themselves sexually from each other, it's a form of robbery. And then this fourth statement, he says this. Separation for some special
[time=3363] purpose, of course, is acceptable, but with mutual consent. And he gives the illustration
[time=3370] of prayer and fasting. I wish that in our culture that we were so committed to prayer that we fasted and we with removed ourselves from each other so that we might spend hours and hours in prayer. Let's learn to approach that standard. But he's simply saying sure
[time=3386] there may be times of non-involvement, but it's with consent. All this leads me to some
[time=3394] conclusions about God's design for our body. Let me give them to you quickly. Conclusion
[time=3402] number one is this. God is not saying nor is Paul that we are appropriate if we demand
[time=3409] sexual expression from our maid. He's not saying take, he's saying give. Conclusion
[time=3416] number two is contrary to those who wear their neckties too tight and carry all of their
[time=3423] guilt upon their forehead. This passage is saying sex is for pleasure. I'm not trying
[time=3429] to become a hedonist, but it's simply not saying that sex is for having children. Once you've had children, of course, that part of your body dies. It's saying it's for pleasure.
[time=3440] We give ourselves to each other in that expression. Sex is for the fulfillment of each other.
[time=3449] Not the fulfillment of self, but the fulfillment of each other. And then finally, sex is a gift of God. To one, he gives the gift of being celibate and content. To another, he gives the gift of a partner and fulfillment in every level of intimacy, including the physical.
[time=3465] These three principles. One, singleness is noble. Two, marriage is equally appropriate,
[time=3472] and three, sex within marriage is appropriate as well. A fourth principle pervades all that
[time=3480] we've read today, and it's this one. Obedience to Christ is paramount. Are you single, obey
[time=3487] Christ? Are you married, obey Him? Are you divorced, obey Him? Are you widowed, obey Him?
[time=3498] Take Jesus, Lord of your life, particularly of your single, married, or sex life.
[time=3516] We are very pleased to bring you the Bible Hour. I hope that you enjoyed the special music and the preaching from God's Word from our pastor, Rick Hawks. If, as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your walk with God, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you. Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father,
[time=3536] I thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, and I thank you that you sent your Son to die on the cross for my sins, and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and
[time=3546] to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sins. I ask you to do that today. In Jesus' name,
[time=3553] I pray, amen. We are always pleased when you make a decision like that, and when you do
[time=3559] make a decision, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision, and when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. Earlier today, we talked about a booklet that you can receive entitled forgiveness. You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box
