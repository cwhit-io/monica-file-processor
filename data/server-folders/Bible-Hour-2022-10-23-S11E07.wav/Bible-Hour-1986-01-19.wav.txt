[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=120] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hours.
[time=134] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black-Off Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from a sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists,
[time=145] and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=149] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hours.
[time=179] Now we'll all join together on the fourth stanza, when Christ shall come, sing it out
[time=207] together.
[time=208] When Christ shall come, He shall come back from Asia, and take me home, for Christ shall
[time=219] build my own, then I shall come back from Asia, and get proclaim my God, for free from
[time=230] all, then sing my soul, my Savior God to me, I'll pray God, I'll pray God, I'll pray
[time=252] God, I'll pray God, I'll pray God.
[time=267] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=270] It is a joy this morning to assemble and to praise God.
[time=276] We call this a morning worship service.
[time=279] The word worship means to assign worth, and we've come today to say that God is worthy
[time=285] of our praise, worthy of our love, worthy of our adoration, and we've come together as
[time=291] a body of people to faithfully worship Him.
[time=294] We welcome you this morning to this service, and also want to welcome our friends who are joining us by way of television today.
[time=301] We've come to worship Him as faithful people we come.
[time=305] Our choir reminds us of that in an anthem that speaks, calling us to come as faithful
[time=311] people.
[time=312] Oh, come all ye faithful.
[time=315] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the worship
[time=340] of God.
[time=370] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the worship
[time=390] of God.
[time=391] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the
[time=402] worship of God.
[time=405] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the worship of God.
[time=416] worship of God.
[time=423] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God.
[time=457] worship of God, and cry from the tongues of God to the worship of God.
[time=477] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the
[time=493] worship of God, and cry from the tongues of God.
[time=512] All ye faithful, ye children, God sing, and cry from the tongues of God to the
[time=526] worship of God, and cry from the tongues of God.
[time=538] What a privilege it is to fellowship together and to praise the name of our Savior.
[time=543] Come Christians, join to sing, join with the choir and congregation singing together hymn number 90 hymn number 90.
[time=559] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=601] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=615] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=649] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=671] One of the privileges of our church is to extend our ministry beyond this corner, beyond
[time=678] the reach of the Bible hour, and literally around the world through missionaries that God has given us the opportunity of supporting and becoming partners with through prayer.
[time=689] One of our missionaries is David Black who is serving in the Philippines.
[time=693] He's home now for study in furlough, David, welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=697] We miss your family.
[time=698] Well, thank you, Pastor Hawks.
[time=700] They would like to be here with us today, but because of sickness, they're staying home at Menton, Indiana, but praying for the service.
[time=707] David, we are so thankful that you could spend part of this busy time with us, letting us know a little bit about your work.
[time=713] Tell our people, if you would, please, where you've been serving and the type of work that you have been doing and what you will be doing.
[time=720] Thank you.
[time=721] Well, since 1974, we have been with the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism in the Philippine Islands.
[time=727] My work in the past years has been in theological education by extension.
[time=732] The past term has been two years of actual pastoral ministry and getting a church organized and then starting a school lay of church ministries in Manila and teaching part-time in one of
[time=743] our seminaries.
[time=744] Well, David, you told us last hour in the first service, when you go back, you'll be teaming up with some other missionaries that we know and love.
[time=752] That's true.
[time=753] It's with Ken and Alice Cole, whose folks I know are here this morning in the service, and we love them, think much of them, and we will be starting to work with them in a church planning ministry, and then teaching part-time in our new, they have the seminary there in the ministry in Biblical counseling.
[time=769] David, that is a noble task to take on all three of those, the church and the school and the counseling, and we as a body of people need to be praying for David and for Susan and, of course, Ken and Alice, the Cole's, and also we have some people there, you may not know the ballast, so we're well represented in the Philippines.
[time=786] David, you've been there a number of years.
[time=789] Tell us one of the best experiences that you can share with us.
[time=793] Well, I think the thing that has been maybe the most exciting is seeing a group of believers
[time=799] after some 13 years meeting and, first of all, a Bible study, and then on a Sunday morning
[time=805] as an inter-denominational group, finally come to their own conviction in studying the word of God that they wanted to organize into an independent Baptist church.
[time=814] And we just had the privilege of coming and kind of reaping part of the harvest, and so in December of 1983, we were able to see the Christ Baptist church organized in late day Philippines.
[time=825] You know, one of the things that is the most concerned, I'm sure to you, but paramount to us, is people coming to Christ?
[time=832] Are there people in the Philippines receiving the Lord?
[time=836] That is true.
[time=837] They are.
[time=838] And we have had the experience both in personal evangelism and in various ways of counseling with them and also in a hospital ministry of seeing people trust Christ as their Savior.
[time=848] David, for what things can we pray for you and Susan?
[time=851] Well, right now, pray for an open ministry.
[time=853] We need to see God provide at least another $430 a monthly support before we leave in
[time=859] July.
[time=860] Possibly, we're going to have to contact new churches.
[time=863] We don't know.
[time=864] Pray for that, and as we go, we want God to be able to use us in the lives of those of you that we minister to, pray for the thesis that we're trying to have written before we go, and for our health and safety and travel.
[time=878] Right now, would you bow with me in prayer, and we'll pray for David, his family, and the Philippines?
[time=884] God, thank you for men and women who will do anything and everything to share your son,
[time=891] Jesus Christ.
[time=893] Thank you for our privilege of being partners with David and Susan and Jonathan and James, with Ken and Alice as their partners on the field.
[time=901] Father, we pray that you'll bring in the necessary financial support.
[time=905] We pray that you'll help David as he finishes a theological master's and mission's thesis.
[time=911] We pray for the health of their family as they're not well today, and most of all, we pray that you'll use them in an effective way to draw these people of the Philippines that you love so dearly to your son, Jesus, in whose name we pray.
[time=925] [AMEN - 1 seconds] Thank you, David.
[time=928] As we worship this morning, Kevin Rowe is going to minister to us in song.
[time=932] When Paul would write to the churches, he would say, "Grace in peace to you and glory
[time=938] to God the Father." Thank you, Kevin.
[time=958] Let us thank the one who knows us, said apart, blameless in his side.
[time=974] Through the sun we have faith, we have life, to the praise of his glorious grace.
[time=987] May the God of our Lord, the Almighty Father, give you wisdom and peace his comforting spirit
[time=1000] that you may know his hope, that you may know his riches, that you may know his mighty strength
[time=1014] to the praise of his glorious grace, to the praise of his glorious grace.
[time=1034] Praise in peace to you, through Jesus, our deliverer receives us, our hearts created
[time=1050] for his word, our salvation was spoken and we heard, to the praise of his glorious grace.
[time=1063] May the God of our Lord, the Almighty Father, give you wisdom and peace his comforting spirit
[time=1076] that you may know his hope, that you may know his riches, that you may know his mighty strength
[time=1092] to the praise of his glorious grace, to the praise of his glorious grace.
[time=1122] [AMEN]
[time=1141] Today is an unusual day for Pete and me because we are not able to broadcast the Bible hour
[time=1147] here in Fort Wayne because we are preempted by the cerebral palsy telethon but that does
[time=1153] give us a special opportunity to talk directly to you friends who live in Marion and in South Bend and are watching on those stations.
[time=1160] Hello, Pete, how are you today?
[time=1162] I'm just fine.
[time=1163] Rick, I'm particularly pleased that we're on the Marion and the South Bend station because I grew up in the South Bend area and then I taught it, Marion High School for a number of years so those are familiar areas to me, well it is always a joy to be able to share the Lord in what we consider hometowns and familiar places.
[time=1181] That's right.
[time=1182] One of the blessings we have here in Fort Wayne is often we'll be shopping at the mall or visiting at the hospital and people will stop us and remark that they watch the Bible hour
[time=1192] and how much they appreciate that ministry but we're not in Marion or South Bend often enough to see many of you so we want to encourage you to write a letter from you telling us
[time=1202] that you've been watching and what the ministry means to you is such an encouragement to us and it helps us to sharpen our perspective.
[time=1210] We take seriously the comments, the suggestions and the encouragement you have so we'd love to hear from you and we're encouraging you today who live in Marion and in South Bend and in those areas of broadcast coverage to write to us, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=1226] From time to time we receive some real encouragement through the mail.
[time=1229] Yes Rick and often we share these letters with our choir and with other people in our church
[time=1235] who are involved in the Bible hour because it is such an encouragement.
[time=1238] We got one of these letters this week that I think was just really an encouragement to all of us and I'd like to read some of it to you.
[time=1245] We enjoy the Bible hour and the presentation of the fundamental truths as recorded in the Holy Scripture.
[time=1251] Today many churches are involved in lengthy liturgies and a short sermon.
[time=1256] We wish to support the Bible hour so that God's Word in its truth and purity will be brought into the homes of the sick, the elderly and hopefully to the people who have not learned
[time=1266] about the triune God and his plan of redemption for all mankind.
[time=1271] May Almighty God in His mercy, in His grace and in His divine love which passes all human understanding continue to bless your ministry, the Bible hour and your congregation.
[time=1282] You know I read that letter and was so encouraged by the fact that this man truly knew the Lord
[time=1288] and what he said is exactly right.
[time=1290] Our ministry is an attempt to make mankind aware of the fact that our God has a plan of
[time=1297] redemption and a plan of forgiveness which is available in Jesus Christ.
[time=1302] Pete thank you for sharing that letter and of course to our friends who have written.
[time=1306] Thank you so much for your notes and we will read them and take diligence to take your suggestions to heart.
[time=1313] Today we want to share a helpful little booklet with you with the simple one word title forgiveness.
[time=1321] This book I know will be a great help to each of us in the growth of our Christian life.
[time=1327] Forgiveness is something that we receive of course from God and many of us struggle
[time=1333] with a number of spiritual, emotional and even physical health problems from a lack of forgiveness.
[time=1341] It can begin to take a grip of our life and hold us prisoner.
[time=1346] It can damage us spiritually, it can damage us emotionally and those two problems can lead
[time=1353] to a number of physical problems.
[time=1356] Doctors have told us that as much as 50% of all illness is not physical in its root but
[time=1362] it is emotional, mental or spiritual.
[time=1366] Forgiveness is one of the greatest anecdotes that I know of.
[time=1370] I want to encourage you today to write for this little booklet entitled in forgiveness
[time=1376] so that you can know that God has washed away your sins and that you can not only be forgiven
[time=1382] but you can learn how to be a forgiver.
[time=1384] If you are right to us today we will be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1388] Pete would you tell our friends how they can receive one?
[time=1391] Yes you can receive a copy of the booklet forgiveness by writing to the Bible Hour box
[time=1397] 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1403] That's the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1411] Thank you again for joining us today.
[time=1413] As Pete has just given you the address we do want to encourage you to write.
[time=1417] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, Scott Schindler will be ministering to us in music playing both the piano and the synthesizer.
[time=1438] [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=1654] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1662] One of the unique privileges of the Church of Jesus Christ is to pray and to pray in His name.
[time=1670] Too often the things that we do that we do so often we begin to take for granted, but prayer is a unique privilege.
[time=1678] Jesus said, "Hithertofore you have asked nothing in my name, ask that you might receive.
[time=1685] Would you stand with me now that we might pray together?
[time=1688] We stand as a reminder that there is holy ground.
[time=1692] Where is holy ground where two or three are gathered in His name to pray?
[time=1697] Let us stand together and pray.
[time=1699] [MUSIC]
[time=1705] Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer that calls me from a world of care and bids me at my father's throne.
[time=1719] Make all of my wants and wishes known.
[time=1725] Father, we stand before you today because we sense the privilege that is ours to call you Father
[time=1731] and to come to you in the name of your Son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1738] God, today you are our King.
[time=1741] You are our Lord.
[time=1744] You are our Savior.
[time=1746] And we've come today to ascribe all worth and all glory to your name.
[time=1753] And we today in this worship service make a humble attempt to declare the greatness of who you are.
[time=1764] God, we love you today.
[time=1768] We've come to celebrate the gift of your Son, the Lord Jesus, and to feel the security of knowing Him and knowing you.
[time=1780] And so, Father, today as we worship, we invite you to be here.
[time=1788] And we want everything that we say and each thought that we entertain to please you.
[time=1796] And to glorify you, not this church and not this ministry, but you, O Lord,
[time=1802] to you be all the glory and the praise.
[time=1807] And God, we've come to pray.
[time=1810] We pray for this nation.
[time=1814] We've learned through your word, Father, that sin is a reproach to any people, but that righteousness exalts a nation.
[time=1822] So, God, today we pray for a conscience in this land where purity is pursued and not pleasure alone.
[time=1834] Father, as we think of the millions that are taken by abortion,
[time=1840] we ask your forgiveness for our collective guilt.
[time=1844] And we ask you to shed your grace upon us with spiritual revival so that we might walk in obedience that you might be free to bless us.
[time=1855] We pray for our President today.
[time=1858] We thank you for the record of good health that was reported yesterday.
[time=1864] We pray that you will guide him and give him wisdom.
[time=1868] We pray for our congressmen and senators, and we thank you, like, for men like Dan Coats, who have an unswavering allegiance to you.
[time=1879] We ask that you would guide them as they guide us.
[time=1884] Father, we pray for our church, that there might be a spirit of love.
[time=1892] As we remember, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[time=1896] in his vision for an America that was free from prejudice, God, we join with that prayer.
[time=1903] We pray that you would rid us of prejudice between black and white,
[time=1910] between Americans and Libyans, between the United States and the Soviet Union,
[time=1920] between those of us who have much, those of us who have seemingly little,
[time=1927] between those of us who know the sting of defeat,
[time=1933] and those of us who know the exhilaration of victory.
[time=1938] God, make us one through your son, and for our love for one another.
[time=1946] Lord, we pray for your grace upon those who are suffering.
[time=1950] We pray for Mary Lampman, George and Dan, for Tammy Hopkins Crane in the homegoing of her mother Phyllis and for their family.
[time=1962] We pray for Marvisle, Bill Martin, Hazel Huber, Ralph Kramer.
[time=1971] We pray for Judy Neusbaum's mother, for a body that is suffering,
[time=1978] though we may not know this one's name or that one's condition.
[time=1982] God, you've given us a heart of care.
[time=1985] And now as we open your word, Father, we ask you to teach us, all of us, especially the one teaching, in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1999] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=2003] Now would you open your Bible with us that we can study together what God has spoken.
[time=2010] Today our privilege is to study His word.
[time=2013] We need not look to human opinion.
[time=2017] Although we can learn much from each other, our reference point is the Lord and His word.
[time=2025] We've been studying through 1 Corinthians, and today we are in chapter 7 verses 10 through 16.
[time=2031] I invite you to follow along while I read this text for us.
[time=2036] 1 Corinthians chapter 7 verses 10 through 16.
[time=2042] And unto the married, I command, yet not I, but the Lord.
[time=2050] Let the wife not depart from her husband.
[time=2055] And if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband,
[time=2063] and let not the husband put away his wife.
[time=2070] But to the rest, speak I, not the Lord.
[time=2074] If any man hath a wife that believe with not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
[time=2081] let him not put her away.
[time=2085] And the woman who hath a husband that believe with not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
[time=2097] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
[time=2110] But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart.
[time=2114] A brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases.
[time=2120] But God hath called us to peace.
[time=2124] For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shall save thy husband, or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shall save thy wife?
[time=2136] Well, this passage has two very, very important areas of study for us.
[time=2141] The first, the most obvious, God is here giving us some insights and some direction about a critical area, the area of marriage, divorce, and remarriage.
[time=2152] We'll study that this morning.
[time=2155] But there's a second area that has equal relevance here, and that is the character of God's Word.
[time=2162] Are these pages that we hold in front of us in such a familiar way,
[time=2168] simply the words of ancient men and women
[time=2174] who were dedicated to one conviction?
[time=2178] Or is this actually, as we so often call it, the inspired Word of God?
[time=2184] Well, this passage brings us to some interesting phrases that affect the concept of what we call inspiration.
[time=2192] You see, in verse 10, Paul says, "I'm to the married, I command, yet not I, the Lord."
[time=2199] And then in verse 12, he says, "Just the opposite.
[time=2203] But to the rest I speak, not the Lord." Some have said, "Wow." Is Paul here saying that some of what he is giving to us comes from God and the rest of us, just his opinion?
[time=2216] That this part's inspired and this part's only perspired?
[time=2220] I mean, what is that the Word contains?
[time=2223] And some have looked at that and said, "Aha!
[time=2226] You see, only part of God's Word's inspired." And Paul's here admitting that part of his statements are not from the Lord.
[time=2234] That's a misunderstanding of these phrases.
[time=2237] All of it is the inspired Word of God.
[time=2241] In verse 10, when Paul said, "I command, yet not I, but the Lord."
[time=2247] He was about to give to them a statement about marriage that was not original.
[time=2254] It had been said some 20 or 30 years earlier by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2259] For you see, while Christ was on earth on at least two occasions, he taught on marriage and divorce.
[time=2267] In Matthew chapter 5, which we call the Sermon on the Mount, and then again in Matthew chapter 19, he made some succinct statements about marriage, divorce, and remarriage.
[time=2279] Now Paul is going to quote what Jesus said.
[time=2283] So he's almost giving an in-text footnote.
[time=2287] Then in verse 12, when he says to the rest, "I speak, not the Lord."
[time=2293] He is simply saying, "What I am now going to give to you has never been given before." When the Lord taught on marriage, divorce, and remarriage, he didn't cover this issue.
[time=2303] And now I'm going to give it to you.
[time=2305] These aren't the words of Jesus.
[time=2307] But they're still the words of God as God inspired Paul to write them.
[time=2312] He's simply now just not quoting the Lord.
[time=2316] All of this has three, I think, very important applications for us to carry.
[time=2321] First of all, God's Word is inspired.
[time=2326] First, excuse me, 2 Timothy, 3, 16 says, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
[time=2335] That word inspired means that God has breathed it out, that he has moved it,
[time=2341] that he has caused it to be.
[time=2343] The word that I like best is that God superintended the writing of His Word.
[time=2349] No, God didn't say, "Paul write this." I, Paul, capital P, A-U-L, 2, Corinth, capital.
[time=2357] No, God didn't dictate it, and Paul was nothing more than a stenographer.
[time=2362] God used who Paul was.
[time=2364] His training, His knowledge, His understanding of both the Hebrew and the Greek world, and then God by His Spirit said, "Write," and Paul wrote, and while he wrote, God superintended that to keep it from air and intrusion of something that God would not want to be there.
[time=2380] It is inspired.
[time=2382] Then secondly, if it is inspired, it is authoritative.
[time=2386] If God has spoken, we need to listen.
[time=2391] This then isn't simply the opinion of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2395] It is not simply the opinion of Peter or John or James.
[time=2399] This is God speaking.
[time=2401] Now I hope that I am careful as your friend and as your pastor when I am giving an opinion to say, "This is Hox's opinion." And when God has said it to say, "This is God's." Now I hope you will honor my opinion, but don't ever hold it to be God's.
[time=2417] And when you hear God's opinion, it is authoritative.
[time=2421] It is binding, which leads to a third application.
[time=2425] It is then our responsibility to bring our lives into harmony with God's Word.
[time=2434] Tragically, many, many of us have gone on a biblical search and destroy mission,
[time=2440] where we search through the Bible, taking a verse out of context and destroying it, so as to make us feel like God's telling us we can do something that we want to do or telling us we don't have to do something that we feel we should.
[time=2455] It's as though we've made up our mind and we're sailing our life downstream and we're hoping God's going to jump on board somewhere along the journey.
[time=2464] When God says, "No, I'll be the captain of the ship." And it's our job to bring our lives into conformity with His.
[time=2474] It's the inspired, authoritative, relevant Word of God.
[time=2480] And now He gives us some teaching on divorce.
[time=2483] Let me say, first of all, that this passage is not the only passage that deals with divorce in the Bible.
[time=2490] Hence, the principles we're going to look at today aren't the only principles about divorce in the Bible.
[time=2496] This is not an all-exhaustive, conclusive study of everything you wanted to know about marriage, sex, divorce, and remarriage.
[time=2505] As a matter of fact, nothing like that will ever be written.
[time=2508] Three years ago, I began to meticulously record what I believe God's Word has to say about divorce.
[time=2515] Then I took 12 questions and I thought these 12 questions will answer everybody's question on divorce
[time=2522] and the ink wasn't dry until somebody came up with a new one, and there'll be another and another.
[time=2528] Occasionally, you'll see on television, shell motor oil, advertising, and they have the shell answer man.
[time=2535] I'm not the divorce answer man.
[time=2538] But I believe there are some principles that we need to grab hold of and apply.
[time=2543] Even if we can't answer every situation, we need to apply what God has said to those that we can.
[time=2549] So he's going to identify three different groups of people to whom he is speaking.
[time=2554] The first group are two believers married to each other.
[time=2558] The second group are made up of a believer who's married to an unbeliever, and they're going to survive the marriage.
[time=2567] And the third one is a believer married to an unbeliever where the marriage is being threatened.
[time=2572] Situation number one, verse 10. He says, "Under the married, I write, yet not I, but the Lord."
[time=2580] Now that "but the Lord" means he's referring back to a quote that Jesus made.
[time=2585] Jesus made one statement in Matthew chapter 5 and another one in Matthew chapter 19.
[time=2591] And now Paul is going to give you a summary statement of what he believes Jesus was saying.
[time=2596] Here it is. Let not the wife depart from the husband.
[time=2602] Reciprocal at the end of verse 11 it says, "and let not the husband put away his wife."
[time=2609] Great equality here. Doesn't go either way.
[time=2614] Basically what he's saying is God has said marriage is for permanence.
[time=2620] Don't divorce. That's what he's saying. Jesus said, "For this cause shall man leave his father and mother."
[time=2628] What cause to be married? And shall be joined under his wife and the two become one.
[time=2634] And what God has put together, let not man divide a sender.
[time=2639] He is saying marriage is for permanence.
[time=2643] You want to know what God's will is for your life?
[time=2646] If you're married, it's to not get a divorce.
[time=2651] Now he's going to modify this. Not modified. He's going to elaborate on this.
[time=2656] What if you're sitting in Corinth in 56 AD? Three men arrive back.
[time=2663] Staphonus, Fortinatus, and Archicus.
[time=2667] Almost a year ago you sent them to Paul with a whole list of questions and now the answer comes back and they read it and they say, "Don't get a divorce." You swallow deeply because you're already divorced.
[time=2680] It's history. What do you do now?
[time=2686] Verse 11, "But if she depart, let her remain unmarried."
[time=2695] Alright? Here's your situation. You've gotten a divorce. It's not 56 AD, it's 1986 AD.
[time=2704] But let's say you got a divorce and now for the first time you're saying,
[time=2710] "Wow, that's heavy stuff. What do I do now? Paul, Hawks, I am divorced."
[time=2719] Next thing he says, "Alright, if you're divorced, then do one of two things.
[time=2725] Remain unmarried." That means don't go marry someone else.
[time=2730] Or be reconciled to your original mate.
[time=2735] God's plan is if a divorce is taking place because marriage is still designed for permanence, he's saying, "Let's work at getting back together." And don't marry someone else and break the possibility of reconciliation.
[time=2752] So that's his advice to the marriage. Two basic statements.
[time=2755] Statement number one, don't get a divorce. Statement number two, if you're divorced, don't marry somebody else, seek to be reconciled to your mate.
[time=2763] Now, there are two situations that this passage doesn't deal with that I think we need to tie together today so that we're not sending ourselves out confused.
[time=2773] In Matthew chapter 19, Jesus does say, "Marriage is for permanence."
[time=2780] But in the case of sexual infidelity, a divorce and remarriage to a new mate is a possibility.
[time=2791] I like the word possibility because I don't believe that it is necessarily the best choice in most situations.
[time=2804] It's not commanded, Jesus didn't say, "If your spouse is out there cheating, dump the old lady.
[time=2811] If that guy has been unfaithful, do you ship the bum out fast?"
[time=2817] No, that's how we do it here in America.
[time=2823] But God doesn't say that.
[time=2825] If you look at the book of Hosea, God said, "Your wife's been unfaithful, take her back." Take her back. If God says, "Israel, you're my wife and I'll take you back and I'll take you back."
[time=2837] Yet at the same time, even though it's not commanded, it's not encouraged, it is permitted, it is permitted.
[time=2845] So don't allow me or someone else to guilt on you if you're free to remarry and you choose to do that.
[time=2852] That's your freedom.
[time=2856] So some of you today may be divorced and remarried and you had every biblical freedom to do that.
[time=2863] You're clean, you're pure, you're accepted.
[time=2867] What if another situation is true?
[time=2870] What if you divorced and you're remarried and as best as you see what we're saying,
[time=2878] you probably shouldn't have divorced and you shouldn't have remarried?
[time=2881] What do you do now?
[time=2883] I want to ask you to do two things.
[time=2885] First thing that I believe you need to do is to confess that divorce and remarriage as sin.
[time=2893] Now the word confession does not mean, as we used to say in junior high school, to "fess up."
[time=2899] The teacher goes out of the room, 50 rubber bands are unloaded in her direction.
[time=2903] She steps back in the room and says, "All right, who did it?" Ignorantly, she's appealing to find out which one of us did it.
[time=2911] It was usually me and she came straight to the source.
[time=2914] Now, God knows who did it.
[time=2917] He's not saying, "Uh-huh, I've just heard word that somebody at Black Hawk Baptist Church got divorced and remarried and shouldn't have done that." Was it the hoxas, the long breaks, cobis, sutures?
[time=2932] Who was it?
[time=2933] God knows who it was.
[time=2934] It was none of those above.
[time=2936] In case I'm getting you worried, that was not a church announcement.
[time=2941] God knows who of us has done everything.
[time=2945] The word confession then doesn't mean to "fess up" and to let God in on something he didn't know.
[time=2950] The word is a compound of two words, "to say the same." And when we confess, we're saying the same thing as God says.
[time=2960] You see, if God says something "sin," and I say, "Well, no, God, it's the new movement." That's not confession.
[time=2967] If God says it's sin and I say, "Yeah, but everybody else is doing it." That's not confession.
[time=2974] If God says it's sin and I minimize it, that's not confession.
[time=2987] Confession is saying, "God, what you've said is sin.
[time=2990] I admit that it's sin and I won't defend that decision that was wrong."
[time=2996] Now, the great danger that many of us have, if we have violated God's word, is to want to somehow say, "No, I wasn't wrong." And you'll never be free until you say that was wrong.
[time=3008] And as soon as you're willing to confess it, God's willing to forgive at all.
[time=3012] And then the second thing I want to ask you to do, after you forgive it, is keep on living as husband and wife for the glory of the Lord.
[time=3019] Whatever you do, don't divorce each other and say, "Oh, we shouldn't have gotten married.
[time=3023] Let's get a divorce." No, that's not God's plan either.
[time=3028] Deuteronomy 24 says, "You can't divorce your second one and go back to your first one.
[time=3032] You can't do that." Now, let me try to repeat all of that very quickly.
[time=3038] One, you're married to a believer and you're a believer, don't get a divorce.
[time=3042] Two, you've already gotten a divorce, remain unmarried and be reconciled.
[time=3046] Three, if you have a biblical freedom to remarry, then you're allowed to do that.
[time=3052] Four, if you have already remarried and you shouldn't have confessed it and live together as husband and wife and make the best out of your life and honor the Lord, he'll cleanse you and he'll use you.
[time=3062] But he'll never cleanse you and use you to your fullest potential if you continually defend the wrong decision.
[time=3069] You don't have to confess that to me.
[time=3071] You don't have to confess it to anybody but to God.
[time=3074] That's what he says.
[time=3076] Now, a whole different situation, emergence.
[time=3080] Now, we have two people who are unbelievers who get married.
[time=3086] Now, I believe these are two unbelievers because the Bible elsewhere makes it clear that a believer should not marry an unbeliever.
[time=3093] If you're thinking about marrying an unbeliever today, don't.
[time=3097] 2 Corinthians 7, chapter 6, verse 14.
[time=3102] But what happens if you and you get married as two unbelievers in Christ
[time=3108] and one of you becomes a believer?
[time=3110] Now, what should you do?
[time=3112] Well, many people taught that you ought to get out of that marriage fast because you're married to an unbeliever and he or she is unclean.
[time=3120] And Haggai tells us that if clean bread prepared for the sacrifices touches unclean, it's contaminated and can't be used.
[time=3129] And they argued, well, you're a believer.
[time=3132] If you live with that unbelieving husband or wife, then you're unclean and God can't use you.
[time=3137] No.
[time=3141] Verse 12 says, Paul, if any brother has a wife that, believe it or not, and she'd be pleased to dwell with him, then don't put her away.
[time=3152] And reciprocally, if a lady becomes a believer and her husband's willing to dwell with her, don't put him away.
[time=3160] Why would he say that?
[time=3162] I think for two reasons.
[time=3164] First of all, in verse 14, he gives us the first reason.
[time=3168] Because the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband.
[time=3174] Now, that needs some explanation.
[time=3177] There are those that teach what they call household salvation.
[time=3181] They take it from this word that an unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife to say that if you just become a believer, your husband is guaranteed to become a believer.
[time=3191] Or if you become a believer, men, your wife is guaranteed to become a believer.
[time=3195] You're sanctifying each other.
[time=3197] And they put their finger right on Acts chapter 16, verse 31, where Paul said to the Philippian jailer, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved, and thy house." Now, if you want to take that literally, then my house is going to heaven.
[time=3214] But there are those that say, "If I'll believe on Christ, and I'm guaranteed to be a Catholic who is a believer, by the way," Rachel, Rebecca, and Adam guaranteed to become believers because it says, "If I believe, my house will believe." That's not what it's saying.
[time=3227] It's simply saying, "If you believe on the Lord Jesus, you'll be saved, and if the people in your house believe on the Lord Jesus, they will be saved." It's called an elliptical statement.
[time=3238] We use those statements all of the time.
[time=3241] If I say, "Steve long break," is tall, dark, and handsome.
[time=3247] And so am I.
[time=3249] Did I say, "I'm Steve long break"?
[time=3251] No.
[time=3252] I was saying, "I'm tall, dark, and handsome," which is up for debate on all three points.
[time=3257] But follow the illustration.
[time=3259] I just said, "And so am I." The elliptical statement means you're supposed to go back to the preceding and apply it to what followed.
[time=3267] Paul is simply saying, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, and so will your house." What?
[time=3274] If they believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, they will be saved.
[time=3276] Now, back here in 1 Corinthians 7, this statement, that they'll be sanctified.
[time=3280] I know that in certain times, the word sanctified means that you've received Christ, you've been justified by God, you've been indwelt by the Spirit, and you're bound for glory.
[time=3290] That doesn't mean that every time the word occurs.
[time=3293] It's not a special word that God created.
[time=3297] Stuck it right there.
[time=3298] And every time it means that.
[time=3299] It was used by the pagans to describe their temples.
[time=3302] And I don't think their temples are bound for heaven and dwelt by the Spirit and washed by the blood.
[time=3308] The word simply means to be special, to be acceptable, to be legitimate.
[time=3315] I think what Paul is saying here is, "Wife, you're married to an unbeliever, but because you are a believer, your husband and your marriage is sanctified by God."
[time=3327] He's simply saying, "It is a bona fide, legitimate marriage." Because there were those that were saying, "Aha, you're married to an unbeliever." That is an illegitimate marriage.
[time=3336] Get out of it.
[time=3337] And God said, "No, it's a sanctified marriage.
[time=3339] It's a legitimate, bona fide marriage." And the proof of that is his last statement, verse 14.
[time=3345] Else your children are unclean, but now they're holy.
[time=3350] What that saying is this.
[time=3352] If I say, "Well, I need to divorce Kathy because she's not a believer.
[time=3356] She's a believer.
[time=3357] This is all hypothetical." And I say, "Our marriage is illegitimate." Well, what does that say about Rachel, Rebecca, and Adam?
[time=3366] I'm saying they're a legitimate children and they're not.
[time=3368] And God says they're not unclean.
[time=3370] They're not illegitimate.
[time=3371] They're holy.
[time=3372] They're clean.
[time=3373] They are legitimate.
[time=3374] And the proof that all of this does not mean that the believer's presence saves the unbeliever.
[time=3380] It's found in verse 16 where it says, "You don't know whether your dwelling together will lead to their salvation."
[time=3386] Verse 16 makes no sense if it's automatic.
[time=3393] So Paul is saying if the believer has an unbelieving mate and they're willing to live together,
[time=3399] for two reasons.
[time=3403] One, it's a legitimate marriage.
[time=3405] Stay there for the sake of legitimate children.
[time=3408] And two, verse 16 says, "The greatest opportunity to influence anyone for Christ is in the home."
[time=3415] And women, if you're married to an unbeliever, live godly before them.
[time=3419] Live godly before them.
[time=3422] And you may lead them to Christ.
[time=3424] And then you're living with an unbelieving wife, live godly before them, and you may lead them to the Lord.
[time=3430] That's what verse 16 is saying.
[time=3433] You know, this church has been blessed with many examples of that.
[time=3437] Billy Gould was a member of our church for years.
[time=3441] She prayed for Charles year after year after year after years.
[time=3446] Charles wouldn't come to a church.
[time=3448] But God in His sovereignty put Pastor Jeremiah and Charles on the same airplane three times in the same month.
[time=3456] And David was not shy.
[time=3459] And he and Charles began to talk and Charles came forward in this auditorium, gave his heart to Christ.
[time=3465] They're married living as husband and wife in Colorado, not Colorado, California, worshiping with John MacArthur.
[time=3472] He's not shy either.
[time=3474] They're believers now because of that.
[time=3477] Sarah Langis prayed for Jack for years.
[time=3481] God got Jack's attention with cancer and he gave his heart to Christ.
[time=3485] This past year a friend of ours came to Christ largely because of the influence that began with a wife who believed.
[time=3493] Love it.
[time=3495] You may lead your spouse to Christ.
[time=3498] Stay in that marriage.
[time=3499] If you're married to an unbeliever, hang in there.
[time=3502] Lead them to Christ.
[time=3507] [MUSIC]
