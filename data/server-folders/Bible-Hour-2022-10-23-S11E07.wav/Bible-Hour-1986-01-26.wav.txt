[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=103] (singing in foreign language) - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=111] Now from the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=126] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=129] (singing in foreign language)
[time=148] [MUSIC - 20 seconds]
[time=178] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=180] - On this cold Sunday morning, I am so thankful
[time=186] for your willingness to come out and to worship with us.
[time=190] And what a joy it is to be a part of an auditorium that is overflowing not only with people, but overflowing with desire to praise the Lord.
[time=199] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning.
[time=201] We welcome you and also welcome our friends who join us now by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=208] Jesus said that I am the light of the world.
[time=213] We've come to worship Him today as the light of the world.
[time=217] The light of the world, Jesus Christ, not only lived in history, but He lives today.
[time=222] And He can live within each of our hearts.
[time=224] For Jesus said that He was the light of the world, but that when He came into our hearts, that He would say you are the light of the world.
[time=233] A city set upon a hill cannot be hidden.
[time=237] So let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
[time=244] Light of the world, our choir and Susan sings, and then Peter will invite you to join with us in a moment.
[time=251] (gentle music)
[time=267] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=287] (gentle music)
[time=297] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=413] - Thank you very much and may the Lord be the light
[time=421] in your life that shines out to this darkened world.
[time=425] May we allow the Savior to work in our lives and to lead us.
[time=428] Let's continue with that theme as we worship together in song, singing 576.
[time=434] Savior like a shepherd lead us.
[time=436] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=440] (soft music) [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=579] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=584] We appreciate the combined efforts of all the voices singing praise to the Lord.
[time=589] We always appreciate our soloists and groups as they sing.
[time=593] Let's listen now to Rick Halls as he ministers to us through the medium of music.
[time=598] (gentle music)
[time=604] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=741] - Again, we do wanna thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=746] Pete, last week we missed a week with our friends in Fort Wayne.
[time=749] We're certainly thankful for the telethon that raised money for so many needy people, but we have to admit you and not being able to broadcast last week.
[time=758] So we're glad to be back with our friends in Fort Wayne.
[time=760] How's the Kobe family today?
[time=762] - We're doing fine, Rick.
[time=764] You're mentioning being missing the telecast last week and we do appreciate the fact, however, that people do write in from time to time to tell us that they either miss the broadcast or have been enjoying the broadcast that's been coming their way through the Bible Hour.
[time=779] - That's really true.
[time=780] Your letters and notes of encouragement to us do exactly that.
[time=785] They encourage us.
[time=786] And week by week we look into the television cameras and simply see a faint shadow of ourself in the lens, but we know you're on the other end of all this electronics and hearing from you is such a strength to our ministry.
[time=799] And we do want to encourage you to write to let us know the parts of the service that are the most meaningful to you and to let us know how God is using the Bible Hour in your life.
[time=809] Pete, you have a friend who has written a letter just like that.
[time=812] Yes, these notes are really encouraging and I hope that as we read one to you, this will be an encouragement for you to write back to us.
[time=820] This person writes, "Each of us have had 16 years "of parochial schooling.
[time=825] "In these years we have heard countless lectures "and sermons by many pastors.
[time=829] "All of our 40 years we have also attended weekly Sunday "and special church services.
[time=835] "However, through all these years, "there have only been a handful of people "that have made the Bible and the true meaning "of being a Christian come alive as does the Bible Hour.
[time=845] "We appreciate the Bible Hour very much." Well that is certainly encouraging and we just need to let that friend know that flattery will get you just about anything, won't it?
[time=855] Well we don't simply want you to write and to let us know words that are appraising us.
[time=860] That's not the point at all, but to know that you're there, you're listening and that God is using not only Pete's labor in mind, but the labor of our television crew and our choir and the whole church is such a strength to our ministry.
[time=873] Please do write to us and Pete's going to give you the address so you can do that right now.
[time=878] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=886] That's the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=892] and the zip is 46815.
[time=895] And when you write, I want to encourage you to ask for this excellent little pamphlet entitled, Forgiveness.
[time=902] Every week we try to make some piece of helpful Christian literature available to you so that you can have an ongoing ministry from God's word in your life.
[time=912] Forgiveness is one of the most appropriate subjects I think any of us can consider.
[time=918] Day in and day out, each of us are going through a time where a relationship has been fractured, a word has been spoken that needs to be retracted, something's been done that has hurt someone else.
[time=930] And many times relationships aren't healed, they actually grow further and further apart because of a lack of forgiveness.
[time=938] I repeat so many times I'm talking with couples who when you trace back their strife with each other, it's something very, very small, but it's simply lacked forgiveness.
[time=947] And so we want to send you this booklet so you can learn how to be a forgiver and to also know that God has forgiven you.
[time=954] It will be helpful whichever side of the injury you're on.
[time=958] If you'll write to us today, we would be glad to send you a copy of forgiveness.
[time=964] Let me encourage you again to write for the booklet, Forgiveness, write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=977] Thank you again for worshiping with us this morning and we pray that God will encourage you through today's broadcast.
[time=984] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, I hope you'll tune your heart to listen to God's word, both in song and in the study of the scriptures.
[time=993] (whistling)
[time=1010] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=1111] (gentle music)
[time=1134] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=1194] (gentle music) - Thank you Denise, would you pray with me?
[time=1199] Father, thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=1206] I have sworn and I will perform it that I may keep thy righteous ordinances.
[time=1212] I am afflicted very much.
[time=1216] Relieve me, O Lord, according to thy word.
[time=1221] Except I beseech thee, the free will offering of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me thy ordinances.
[time=1232] My soul is continually in my hand, yet do I not forget thy law.
[time=1239] Father, your word today gives light to our path.
[time=1245] We thank you that your spirit gives direction, that we today can have a perspective on life that originates from a source greater than ourselves.
[time=1257] And so God today, as we study your word, we've met in this place to give a free will offering the praise of our lips.
[time=1264] Father, today we pray that the meditation of our hearts and the praise of our lips would be acceptable in your sight.
[time=1273] We pray today that your word would become that strong point of revival as the psalmist did pray for each of us.
[time=1283] Father, there are many today whom we love in this body who carry enormous burdens.
[time=1288] And we pray that you would relieve them.
[time=1291] We pray for those who've lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=1295] We pray particularly for Jim and for Cindy Miller and the tragic loss of Jim's father.
[time=1301] God, we ask you to give relief to his heart.
[time=1304] We pray for, Bill and Pam Hackley, for Marianne Martin and the loss of Dr. Martin this week.
[time=1314] We pray that you as the God of all comfort would be with them.
[time=1317] We pray today for Bill and Patty Kolp and for Bob Weimer in the homegoing of Helen.
[time=1325] We pray today for Tammy and Doug Crane as they would fly back to the foreign mission field to serve you, that you would strengthen their hearts in the death of Tammy's mother.
[time=1336] We ask you to encourage Bob's heart.
[time=1338] Father, we pray today for the beloved who fight daily for survival of health.
[time=1347] We pray for Mary, for Hazel, for Ralph Kramer, for Michael Fox and Neil Kolpman.
[time=1357] God, that you would comfort and strengthen these who are fighting and their health is weak.
[time=1364] God, encourage their heart, help them to know of your love and presence.
[time=1368] God, may your word today be a light unto our homes,
[time=1374] that we as husbands might learn to love our wives with a love that emulates that of Christ.
[time=1380] Father, we pray today for our children, that they would see that your word gives light and it's not given to lock them away from pleasure, but to show them pleasures that are forever more.
[time=1394] So, Father, as we study your word today, give to each of us the contentment of trusting you, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1406] Well, this morning, we continue our study in 1 Corinthians chapter seven.
[time=1412] We're going to talk about contentment and how much is enough.
[time=1419] Just how much is enough?
[time=1422] It seems that we're often willing to give up our intelligence to get just a little bit more.
[time=1429] The story is told about a man who was walking through the streets of New York, a would-be mugger came up to him, put a gun right to his head and said, "Give me your money or I'll blow out your brains." The man who was being robbed thought for a moment and said, "Blow away, you can live in New York without brains, but you can't make it without money." (congregation laughing) That's become somewhat descriptive of life in America today, isn't it?
[time=1455] You can make it around here without brains, but it takes a lot of money.
[time=1459] Well, just how much is enough?
[time=1461] Not only of money, but how much is enough of success?
[time=1466] How many more accomplishments do we have to have before we'll say, that's enough?
[time=1472] Or how big does our inventory have to be before we'll say of our business, "It is enough"?
[time=1479] How much time do we have to have of the attention of that special someone in our dating life before we'll say, "That's enough"?
[time=1490] How late must our parents roll back the curfew before we say, "That's enough"?
[time=1495] How much time must we spend pouring over the cares
[time=1502] of our checkbook before we read the balance line and say, "That's enough"?
[time=1508] How many more steps up the corporate ladder do we have to take before we say, "That's enough"?
[time=1516] How much more do we have to paper and paint
[time=1522] and fix our house before we say, "That's enough"?
[time=1527] How much do we have to feel the acceptance of that group over there before we say, "That's enough"?
[time=1536] Contentment.
[time=1541] The apostle Paul said something that is an absolute paradox.
[time=1544] He said godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=1549] Now the paradox is this, contentment means, "I'm happy with what I have and I don't need more." And Paul said, "As soon as you get happy "with what you have and you don't need more, "then you get the gain." Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[time=1563] In 1 Corinthians 7, verse 17 through 24, he speaks about contentment, chapter 7, verse 17.
[time=1571] "But as God hath distributed to every man, "as the Lord hath called everyone, so let him walk.
[time=1580] "And so ordain I in all the churches.
[time=1585] "As any man called being circumcised, "let him not become uncircumcised.
[time=1597] "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, "but the keeping of the commandments of God.
[time=1606] "Let every man abide in the same calling "in which he was called.
[time=1612] "Art thou called being a servant?
[time=1614] "Care not for it.
[time=1617] "But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.
[time=1621] "For he that is called in the Lord being a servant "is the Lord's free man.
[time=1628] "Likewise also he that is called being free "is Christ's servant.
[time=1634] "Ye are bought with a price.
[time=1639] "Be not the servants of men.
[time=1641] "Brethren, let every man, "wherein he is called, they're in abide with God." Here the Apostle Paul speaks at great length about contentment.
[time=1656] I don't know of an issue that is more relevant not only to society, but to my life.
[time=1662] I am as addicted to the American philosophy that more is better and bigger as best as everyone else is.
[time=1670] We have been raised and indoctrinated that somehow if we don't die with more, we're in bad shape.
[time=1680] As a matter of fact, there is a new movement that has gained great popularity called the movement of the yuppies.
[time=1685] And their theme slogan is, "The one who dies with the most toys wins." And now the Apostle Paul comes and he begins to speak about contentment, that elusive archaic word of relevance.
[time=1702] Contentment, Webster defines contentment as being satisfied with one's station or position in life.
[time=1712] Not a bad definition, but allow me to give you a little different perspective this morning if I could.
[time=1719] In studying Aristotle 15 years ago in college, we were taught his principle of the golden mean.
[time=1727] Aristotle said that every virtue of which contentment of course is one, every virtue is the golden mean between two extremes.
[time=1738] Now let me take it and put it in a very practical illustration to help you digest the golden mean.
[time=1744] If you're drowning 20 feet off shore and I don't know how to swim and I jump in and save you, or attempt to save you, I should say, I'm not demonstrating the virtue of courage, I'm demonstrating the extreme of being full-hardy.
[time=1763] I mean, if you're drowning and I can't swim and I jump in to save you, that's not courage, that's full-hardiness.
[time=1768] At the other end of the extreme, if I am a very capable swimmer having been trained as a lifeguard and you're drowning and I do nothing, that's certainly not courage either.
[time=1780] That is cowardice.
[time=1782] And so courage is the golden mean between two extremes.
[time=1788] Contentment in the same way is the golden mean between two extremes, the extreme of apathy and the extreme of avarice.
[time=1797] Apathy says, I don't care.
[time=1801] I don't care what needs you have, I don't care what's happening in the world around me, I don't care about society, I don't care, just leave me alone, I don't care.
[time=1814] Avarice says, there's gotta be more and I must have it.
[time=1819] Contentment is that balanced point in life where you say, if there is more and it's available, I would thank God for, but I can be happy today.
[time=1828] My contentment is now, it's not when, it is now.
[time=1833] The Apostle Paul speaks about contentment, I believe it has such relevant application today because almost every one of us who is struggling in life could cease our struggling if we could simply replace appetite with contentment.
[time=1852] It's that insatiable desire for more that drives us beyond the edge.
[time=1857] And the only anchor that can keep us from going over the cliff is the anchor of contentment.
[time=1864] To be able to look at our life, regardless of our position and say, I can be content.
[time=1873] If mom and dad say, I have to be home at midnight, I can have a great evening by 1159.
[time=1879] Contentment, it's saying I would love to have a promotion,
[time=1885] but if this is my job for the next 20 years, I'll make the best out of that job.
[time=1890] Contentment, it's looking at your marriage and said,
[time=1896] I should have married her after all and saying, but I'll make the best of it with Rick.
[time=1901] That's contentment.
[time=1902] It's looking at your whole life and say,
[time=1908] we've got more kids than we have walls.
[time=1910] Two of them are climbing the same wall, but if we can't afford a bigger house, I can be content.
[time=1917] Contentment is also looking at a body that is broken and saying, I can be content.
[time=1926] I wish that God would give health.
[time=1928] Nick, we prayed for your mother that God would give her health.
[time=1933] We pray for a Ralph Kramer that God would give him health, but there also comes a point in life where we say, God will be content in whatever state you've given us.
[time=1942] Not easy lessons to learn.
[time=1944] It's not easy to take that word of contentment and say, I'll live it out with a spouse.
[time=1951] I'll live it out with a son who is rebellious.
[time=1954] I'll live it out with a father who's uncaring.
[time=1957] I'll live it out with cancer, contentment.
[time=1962] Paul gives us three specific areas of which to find contentment.
[time=1969] The first area is the area of marriage.
[time=1974] That's the whole context of chapter seven.
[time=1976] He's given advice to those who are single, to stay single, and he's given advice to those who are married to stay married.
[time=1983] He says that they're married, hang in there.
[time=1985] Even if they're not a believer, you hang in there.
[time=1989] And his whole conclusion is this, verse 17, at the end of this passage that is previously dealt exclusively with marriage and singleness, he says, but as God had to distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called everyone, so let him walk.
[time=2005] He said, if God called you to Christ and you became a believer in Christ as a single woman, hang in there single.
[time=2014] If God called you to Christ and you're a married person, hang in there married, be content in that state.
[time=2020] The great principle of this passage is contentment, contentment, accepting your position in life.
[time=2029] He said it in verse 17, which we've just quoted.
[time=2032] Verse 20, he comes back and says it again, let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called, and then finally in verse 24.
[time=2041] Rather than let every man in whatever state he is called therein to abide with God.
[time=2046] Now, in verse 17 when he says, be content.
[time=2052] Verse 20, he said be content.
[time=2056] Verse 24, be content.
[time=2057] One begins to get the impression that God is encouraging us to be content.
[time=2062] Now he talks about marriage, but he moves to a secondary.
[time=2068] It would be what we might call the ethical or cultural background.
[time=2072] There was great division between the Hebrew world
[time=2078] and the Gentile world.
[time=2080] Occasionally the Bible called them Jews and Greeks, other times they call him Hebrews and barbarians.
[time=2088] Sometimes they're called Jew and Gentile, but there was this line of division.
[time=2093] And it seemed that on each side of the line there were those that thought I'd be better off if I were on the other side.
[time=2100] There were Greeks that had fallen under the hearing of false teaching that said, oh, it's good that you Greeks came to Christ, but if you really wanna be close to God, be a Jewish Christian, then you would be closer to God.
[time=2116] And so they felt like if I ate only what did Jews ate, that wouldn't please God.
[time=2123] If I observed all the traditions that the Jews observed, that would really please God.
[time=2128] And if I were a male and I was circumcised, that would really please God.
[time=2132] And they said, oh boy, I had to get on the other side of the line.
[time=2134] In the same way there were Jews who thought, boy,
[time=2140] Christ has set me free from all this.
[time=2143] I wish I weren't Jewish.
[time=2145] I wish my father wasn't Abraham.
[time=2147] I wish I wasn't circumcised.
[time=2151] And they even had a surgical procedure to remove that.
[time=2155] James Mitchner in his book The Source tells that story of a Hebrew athlete who wanted to change his body so he'd be more Greek-like.
[time=2163] Paul saying here, it doesn't matter your culture.
[time=2167] It doesn't matter your background.
[time=2168] If you were born a Hebrew, then be a Hebrew believer in Christ.
[time=2173] If you were born a Gentile, then be a Gentile believer in Christ and be content in whichever state it is.
[time=2180] He said, it doesn't matter whether you're a Jew or Gentile, circumcised, uncircumcised.
[time=2184] He said, the only thing that matters is keeping God's commandments.
[time=2188] That's all that matters, obeying him.
[time=2191] And one of the great tragedies that was happening at this point in the world is that there were those who were Jews trying to force their Jewish tradition on Gentile Christians and conversely the Gentiles trying to force their tradition.
[time=2208] And God's saying, wherever you are in life, when you come to Christ, accept that and be content right there.
[time=2215] Now of course he doesn't mean if you're one of those temple prostitutes, be content, hang in there with the business.
[time=2221] That's not what he's saying at all.
[time=2224] He's already clarified what's sin and what's not sin.
[time=2227] But there are a lot of cultural things that he says, don't matter at all.
[time=2233] One group of people say, you can't eat pork.
[time=2235] If you're not comfortable eating pork, don't eat it.
[time=2239] This group thinks they're comfortable eating pork, eat it.
[time=2242] One of the great tragedies of the whole missions movement of the last 200 years is that we have gone from this great country around the world trying to lead people to be Americans first in Christians second.
[time=2258] And while I love this country, I don't believe God has called us to make anyone an American.
[time=2265] And if there is somebody who has a Hindu tradition and in that country they wear a shirt with no collar except for what sticks up, that's fine.
[time=2274] I don't know of any place in the Bible where it says thou shall on Sunday morning wear a tie.
[time=2279] But I'm sure if there is a place that says that it has to be red or blue, one of the two.
[time=2284] God doesn't say ties.
[time=2287] He doesn't say suits for men and dresses for ladies.
[time=2290] That's cultural stuff.
[time=2292] You know, some of the worst things have happened in the name of Christ that Christ had never, never encouraged.
[time=2299] Why? Because we've tried to take our culture and push it on somebody else.
[time=2306] Let him be an Indonesian.
[time=2310] Let him be a Filipino.
[time=2312] Let him be a Chinaman.
[time=2314] That's why Hudson Taylor was so successful after years and years and years of finally penetrating that culture because he came one of them.
[time=2324] You know, and the same thing happens in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=2326] There's an old joke saying that we want to get people saved, sound, and sanctified.
[time=2332] But we try to do that in reverse order.
[time=2335] But we really prefer you to act like a Christian, talk like a Christian, walk like a Christian, dress like a Christian, and then we'd love to have you come to our church and consider becoming a Christian.
[time=2346] Well, that's reverse.
[time=2348] And Jesus was constantly under tension because people say, "Boy, do you see the crowd he's running with?
[time=2356] "Wow, lose people, strange characters." And Jesus said, "Yeah, those who are sick need the physician."
[time=2368] God's blessed this church.
[time=2369] And we've got a number of physicians here this morning.
[time=2372] But could you imagine going to a doctor and doctor saying, "I'm sorry, I'd really like to help you." But you're sick!
[time=2381] "Man, I can't help you.
[time=2383] "Why, if I helped you "and some healthy person needed my attention, "I wouldn't be able to help them." But that's the same approach we take to sharing Christ.
[time=2392] "Man, I can't get too close to you.
[time=2394] "You don't know the Lord.
[time=2398] "And you just might tarnish my image." Look in the mirror, it's already been tarnished.
[time=2403] Paul's saying, "Don't let these cultural things "become a barrier.
[time=2407] "If you're a Jew, be a Jewish believer in Christ.
[time=2410] "If you're a gentile, be a gentile believer in Christ." He said, "Whatever you are, be content.
[time=2417] "Be content." Then he applies this to a third area.
[time=2424] One that takes us by surprise and catches us off balance.
[time=2430] And verses 21 through 24, he now talks about being a slave and being content.
[time=2437] And boy, when I read that, I said, "Wait a minute, Paul.
[time=2439] "Don't you remember, January the 1st, 1863.
[time=2443] "The Emancipation Proclamation was put into effect.
[time=2446] "And I hate slavery, and I'm convinced that God does too.
[time=2451] "But Paul here writes to a world, "and he said, "If you're a slave, be a slave." It has been estimated that perhaps more than one-third of the Roman Empire were technically slaves.
[time=2464] And he now writes to them about contentment.
[time=2469] That seems foreign to my mind.
[time=2471] I think that you're supposed to call grant and Sherman to gather and muster the boys and wherever it is, we're gonna attack.
[time=2480] We're gonna make those slaves free.
[time=2485] Why is it that God hasn't herein declared that slavery is atrocious because I believe that it is, and I believe that's God's viewpoint?
[time=2495] I think the reason is this.
[time=2499] Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[time=2504] "For if it were, then my disciples would fight." You see, God's Son, Jesus Christ, did not come into the world to change social institutions.
[time=2519] He came into the world to change people.
[time=2521] And when people are changed, then social institutions will change.
[time=2529] But if people aren't changed, social institutions will not change.
[time=2533] Let me give you an example of each from our history.
[time=2536] There came a point in our history where a minority of people said that alcohol is abusive in destroying our country.
[time=2544] And out of Hillsborough, Ohio, there came a group called the WCTU, Women's Christian Temperance Union, and they marched through the streets and they attacked the saloons.
[time=2553] And a movement was started called prohibition.
[time=2559] And this relatively small minority gained the ear of the legislatures and an act was passed in Congress that became a constitutional amendment prohibiting alcohol.
[time=2572] I wish that would have been a great success, but it wasn't.
[time=2576] But you see what happened?
[time=2577] A law was passed, but there was no change in the heart of a nation.
[time=2581] And so prohibition simply gave rise to speakeasies in the bootleggers, the moonshineers and the smugglers.
[time=2588] Why? Because there was no change of heart and prohibition was repealed because it spawned more crime than it reduced.
[time=2597] Why? Because the law was bad.
[time=2599] I don't think the law was bad.
[time=2600] It simply was the fact that you can change laws, but if you don't change hearts, it doesn't matter.
[time=2606] But then there was a point in American history which we called the Second Great Awakening.
[time=2611] First Great Awakening were the days of George Whitfield and Jonathan Edwards, 1800 saw a new movement.
[time=2619] The movement was called the Second Great Awakening.
[time=2622] Chief Spokesperson was a man by the name of Charles Finney.
[time=2626] A lawyer turned evangelist.
[time=2628] He began in upstate New York holding revivals.
[time=2631] It went from New York to New England, from New England to Pennsylvania, from Pennsylvania to Ohio to Kentucky to Indiana.
[time=2639] There swept a revival across this nation and the hearts were changed.
[time=2643] And when that spiritual revival came, out of that came a birth of several movements.
[time=2649] One was prison reform.
[time=2652] The first wave of prison reforms in America came out of the Great Awakening under the days of Finney.
[time=2659] There was a second movement that came out of that.
[time=2661] It was called Woman Suffrage.
[time=2664] It was out of that era of revival spiritually that women's suffrage movements were born.
[time=2672] There was a third great movement that came out of the Finney revivals.
[time=2677] When the flames burned, they heated a cauldron that boiled over with abolition of slavery.
[time=2684] And the fire that swept through the north that brought a consciousness that said slavery was wrong began in a spiritual revival.
[time=2693] You see, God gives his word not to change society but to change men and women.
[time=2701] And when men and women's hearts are changed, then society will begin to change.
[time=2705] But you can legislate morality but you cannot regulate it through law.
[time=2709] We have more laws on the books now to control crime
[time=2716] that any point in history and it's absolutely out of control.
[time=2720] Why? Because of the heart of man is the source of it all.
[time=2725] And so the Bible writes not to change the world but to change the people who in turn will change the world.
[time=2735] I hope that we're able to elect legislators and governors
[time=2742] and executives who will honor God's word but that enough is not alone.
[time=2747] I hope they are in turn able to position men and women on the bench who will honor God's word but that enough is not enough alone.
[time=2759] There has to be a spiritual revival that changes hearts.
[time=2763] You can't stop abortion by marching the streets.
[time=2765] I don't object to those who march the street.
[time=2768] It may bring a little bit of public consciousness but you've got to change the hearts of men and women who say my body is my toy and I'll play with it.
[time=2776] And if I'm pregnant or my girlfriend's pregnant, I'll find the quickest, easier way to have my toy back.
[time=2782] There has to be a change of hearts.
[time=2786] So Paul writes to a world that was held in slavery and he doesn't say, "Rebell!" He says, "Be content." Why?
[time=2799] Because there are some things in life you're not gonna change.
[time=2803] But if you change hearts in time, they will change.
[time=2807] He gives these four principles about slavery.
[time=2810] First, he does say to be content.
[time=2812] Secondly, he says though, if you're a slave and you can possibly gain your freedom then gain it, gain it.
[time=2819] That's what he says here in verse 21.
[time=2823] But if thou can be made free, use it.
[time=2826] For a man to gain his freedom, he would have to purchase it from his master.
[time=2833] But he would not give his master the money.
[time=2835] He would go to the temple and there he would give to the priest the money and the money would go then to the patron god or goddess of that community.
[time=2845] And then the slave would no longer be his former master slave, he wouldn't be a free man.
[time=2850] He would become a slave to that god, never to be enslaved to a man again.
[time=2855] And here he's saying, "If you can purchase your freedom "then purchase it." And that leads into his next principle and that is this one.
[time=2863] That regardless of our political status,
[time=2872] we are free in slaves, both at the same time.
[time=2877] He says this in verse 22, "He that is called the Christ to the Lord "and he's a slave, he's the Lord's free man.
[time=2886] "He has given a freedom in Christ "that is a depth and level interpersonally "that society can never give." And anyone who comes to Christ though he'd be a free man politically, he is now God's slave.
[time=2901] He is now God's slave and says, "We are bought with a price.
[time=2905] "Therefore don't become re-enslaved again "to anyone or to anything but to Christ." The cynics, a philosophical group, said this,
[time=2919] "A true man can never be made a slave in nature
[time=2925] "and a false man can never be free in nature.
[time=2930] "O men may shackle other men's bodies "but they'll never enslave the soul.
[time=2934] "It can be free because Christ can set us free.
[time=2939] "And if God has given you political freedom "like he has every one of us, "don't ever forget we're slaves in Christ.
[time=2945] "Don't ever forget that.
[time=2948] "Contentment, regardless of our state.
[time=2954] "Let me try to boil this all down this morning into "what I believe are five very crucial "and important principles.
[time=2962] "The first principle is this.
[time=2964] "More and different are not necessarily better.
[time=2977] "You know as you watch the advertising scheme "there are very few that say, "This is the smallest box of cereal we can possibly make.
[time=2984] "It doesn't happen.
[time=2988] "No one says this isn't a rather new idea.
[time=2991] "This is kind of old.
[time=2992] "We've just recreated the same old thing this year "and thought we'd try to market it to you again.
[time=2997] "No, it's always new.
[time=3001] "It's improved.
[time=3003] "It's new and improved.
[time=3005] "It's bigger.
[time=3007] "Giant size, jumbo size.
[time=3009] "Everything but women's dresses comes that way.
[time=3012] "Because that's our American mentality.
[time=3014] "If I can just get more.
[time=3016] "If I can just get new, that'll somehow be better.
[time=3019] "The old expression, the grass is always greener.
[time=3022] "And we look at our life and say, "If I just wasn't locked in this marriage, "Why, if I was just single again, then I'd have it made." One lady said, "I thought I knew what happiness was "till I got married and then it was too late." "Oh, and if I could just be single again, then I'd be happy." I said, "You wouldn't be happy if you were single again." Someone said, "If I could just get out of this lousy corporation "and get into that other one, "boy, they entreat their employees much better.
[time=3054] "Oh, then I'd be happy." Irma Bombak has an amazing way of capturing life and putting it in print.
[time=3062] She talked about this syndrome that the grass was always greener.
[time=3066] And they lived in the city and she pleaded with her husband how they had to move to the suburbs, they had to move to the suburbs and they had to have one of those houses with a picture window.
[time=3074] So they built a house and they put this huge picture window and they were gonna see the world that it goes by.
[time=3080] They were gonna wave to the neighbors.
[time=3082] They were gonna let the beauty of the sunlight in.
[time=3084] She said, "We weren't in that house one month "before we had to spend $500 for drapes." You know, we gotta have this window and as soon as we have the window, we gotta cover it up.
[time=3093] And her conclusion was this, the grass is only greener over the septic tank.
[time=3101] And that's life, if you're not content today, you're not gonna find it tomorrow.
[time=3108] There's an old Greek proverb that says, "He who is not content with little will never find it." Just remember this, new and more is not necessarily better.
[time=3123] Principle number two,
[time=3129] "Some things in life cannot be changed." For the Roman world, there were millions and millions in slavery and it couldn't be changed.
[time=3140] For some of you, it's your health.
[time=3144] It can't be changed.
[time=3147] For some of you, it's a husband who was as insensitive as a man could be when you can't change him.
[time=3157] For others of you, it is a son or a daughter who is rebellious and truly incorrigible and you can't change them.
[time=3165] For some of you, it's your job and you can't change it.
[time=3176] There are things in life that we can't change.
[time=3183] And when we determine that we'll not be happy until they change, then we will not be happy.
[time=3188] We need to learn the wisdom
[time=3194] that perhaps is originally credited to St. Francis, who said, "God, give me the courage "to change the things that I can, "the grace to accept the things that I cannot "and the wisdom to know the difference."
[time=3216] Beloved, there are things in your life that you can't change.
[time=3219] And while you may not feel better in that one area of life, you can find happiness if you can find contentment.
[time=3227] Principle number three, often it is the process
[time=3233] and not the product that gives us fulfillment in life.
[time=3238] Let me say that again.
[time=3240] Often it's not the product, but it's the process that gives us the happiness in life.
[time=3248] It's not so much a life's destination as it is the journey that's meant to be a joy.
[time=3252] We love to work around the house.
[time=3257] I'm sure one of these days I'll find myself doing something as ludicrous as wallpaper in the garage or something.
[time=3263] We just enjoy working around the house.
[time=3266] But I'll get in the middle of the job and I'll begin to say, "Boy, if I could just "get this paper, hunger, if I could just "get this chair rail level, or if I could just "get this electrical connection worked out right, "ah, then I can sit down." You know what I've discovered?
[time=3280] It's not getting the electrical connection, right?
[time=3282] It's the fun of doing it.
[time=3284] It's the process.
[time=3287] The college days can be fun, even if you aren't ready to get your degree tomorrow.
[time=3294] God's given us a life.
[time=3298] And while we're not hedonistic in our values, we oughta take time to enjoy it.
[time=3303] Because as someone said, it really doesn't get any better than this.
[time=3308] Whatever you do, remember that next year, you're gonna sit down and you're gonna remember how good today was.
[time=3315] Because these are soon to be the good old days.
[time=3320] One man put it this way.
[time=3323] He said, "Oh, the days seem late and long "when all goes right and nothing goes wrong "and isn't your life extremely flat "with nothing whatsoever to grumble at?" We need a little challenge.
[time=3338] We need a little stress.
[time=3341] We need a little adversity.
[time=3344] But please do notice the adjective a little.
[time=3347] But you know, we talk about the stress of life and it is there and it needs to be combated, but stress is not always your enemy.
[time=3356] You go talk to someone who's retired and who has poor health and who feels like they're locked in their house and they can't do anything.
[time=3364] They'd love to have a need to be needed.
[time=3367] It's the process as much as the product
[time=3373] that's to be enjoyed in life.
[time=3375] Be content where you're at, not just in where you're going.
[time=3378] Fourthly, this principle.
[time=3381] If you can't find contentment now, you never will.
[time=3389] You've probably heard the story of J.D. Rockefeller who during his life was far and away the most wealthy man in history.
[time=3397] A reporter asked him, "Mr. Rockefeller, "you've got more than anyone else has ever had.
[time=3402] "What one thing do you wish you had that you don't?" And without a hesitation, the multi-billionaire said,
[time=3411] "Just one thing, a little bit more."
[time=3418] If you're not content with what you have, more won't solve the problem.
[time=3422] And finally, and most importantly, this principle, contentment is found in God.
[time=3429] Augustine said, "We are restless, "so God until we find our rest in the Pascal," said, "God has made us and he has shaped us "with an internal vacuum that he alone can fill, "and we're restless as we go through one product "after another trying to fill that vacuum." There are two things essential to finding contentment, one is knowing Christ, but that's not enough.
[time=3452] Rick, did you say knowing Christ is not enough?
[time=3456] I did, it's not only enough that you know him, but secondly, you must obey him.
[time=3460] That's what he said in verse 17.
[time=3462] Culture is nothing but keeping the commandments is.
[time=3465] If we don't think like God thinks, we're not gonna find contentment.
[time=3469] Shakespeare said through the mouth of Henry VIII, or excuse me, Henry VI, my crown is called contentment.
[time=3478] A crown that is seldom enjoyed by kings.
[time=3482] If you had no contentment today, you would find it first in accepting Christ, and then secondly as a believer, walking an obedience, making his thoughts your thoughts.
