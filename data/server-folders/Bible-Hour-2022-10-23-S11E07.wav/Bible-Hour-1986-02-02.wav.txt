[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hours.
[time=108] Now from the Convocation Center of the Blackoff Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from a sanctuary prior, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hopkins.
[time=123] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=133] Let's lift our voices together now on that fourth verse.
[time=136] Sing out with me, won't you?
[time=138] (singing in foreign language)
[time=199] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=205] Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord.
[time=210] Let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation.
[time=214] Let us come before Him with thanksgiving, and us stole Him with music and song.
[time=221] For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods.
[time=227] In His hands are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.
[time=235] The sea is His, for He has made it, and His hands form the dry land.
[time=241] Come, let us bow down in worship.
[time=244] Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for He is our God.
[time=249] And we are the people of His pasture, the flock of His care.
[time=255] Welcome this morning to our worship service, as we've come together to worship the Lord, to sing and to give praise to His name.
[time=263] He is a God who gives grace and strength, for He has created us and He loves us.
[time=269] Welcome today, I hope you've come with the spirit of worship.
[time=273] We also want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=277] As we come to this service, we come to worship and to praise and to receive from God direction,
[time=285] that His Word might guide us.
[time=287] The Scripture says, "Thy word, O Lord, is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path."
[time=317] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=336] When I feel afraid, think I'd pass my way, still go there right beside me.
[time=347] When nothing will I be, as long as you are near.
[time=353] Please be near me today.
[time=361] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=383] Now I will not forget, your love for me again, our heart forever is wandering.
[time=394] Jesus, be my guide and hold me by your side, and I will love you to the end.
[time=413] When nothing will I be, as long as you are near.
[time=435] Please be near me today.
[time=442] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[time=463] And the light unto my path, you're the light unto my path.
[time=481] The direction that the Lord gives us is through the Holy Spirit and through His written Word.
[time=490] There are many promises that we can claim today.
[time=493] There's a hymn that's been sung in the churches for years entitled "Standing on the Promises of God."
[time=499] Let's recall those promises as we sing together, hymn number 598.
[time=503] We'll sing the first, third and fourth stanzas, 598.
[time=516] Standing on the Promises of Christ's life, King, through His earth, O ages, and His praises, King.
[time=524] Glory in the highest life, we shall then sing.
[time=528] Standing on the Promises of God, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior.
[time=542] Standing, standing on the Promises of God, standing on the Promises of Christ's life,
[time=558] won't give eternally my love strong for, Overcome me, baby, from the Spirit's sword, standing on the Promises of God.
[time=571] Standing, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior.
[time=586] I, standing on the Promises of God, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior, my Savior, my all in all.
[time=605] Standing on the Promises of God, standing on the Promises of God, my Savior, standing on the Promises of God.
[time=633] Thank you very much for your good singing. Again, we do appreciate it when you participate in that way, praising our God.
[time=641] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path, standing on those Promises that God has given us.
[time=648] There's a time and perhaps an individual lives today where there's a sense of need, of anxiety.
[time=654] We want you to call upon the Lord and listen now as Kerry Johnson comes to suggest that we rest all our problems with the Lord.
[time=662] Let's listen as she sings a song entitled "All Your Anxiety."
[time=692] Come to the cross, each burden bearing.
[time=708] All Your anxiety leave it there.
[time=719] All Your anxiety, all Your care bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.
[time=736] Never a burden that He cannot bear. Never a friend like Jesus.
[time=764] Come then at once, delay no longer.
[time=771] He is intrigued, kind and sweet. You need not fear or disappointment.
[time=787] You will find peace at the mercy seat.
[time=797] All Your anxiety, all Your care bring to the mercy seat, leave it there.
[time=813] Never a burden that He cannot bear. Never a friend like Jesus.
[time=841] Pete and I were just remarking today that we've had great weather for Sundays.
[time=845] It usually seems that by the time we come to the end of January, we've been snowed out once or more.
[time=851] Usually we can count on that and I guess I'm just excited again to be in the house of the Lord anticipating all the people that do come on this particular Lord's Day, Rick.
[time=860] You know, I just dawned on me, this is Groundhog's Day and I don't know whether he saw his shadow or not, but I'm just thankful that we haven't had a bad winter.
[time=867] That's right. Many times we have an additional audience during the Blizzard Sundays and we certainly are thankful we have the opportunity to minister to those people, but we're more thrilled that each of us have been able to be out and to be at our church.
[time=882] We want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. Your letters and notes of encouragement and the many of you that we see in the malls and the hospitals who've spoken a word to us have been a great strength.
[time=894] I want to suggest to you that if you have not been attending church, that that would be the best step that you could take.
[time=901] Obviously, we're thrilled that you're watching, but we are in no way trying to be a substitute for going to church.
[time=908] This is a ministry to those people who haven't the ability to go to church. Maybe they're ill, maybe they have an aged loved one with them that they're taking care of.
[time=917] Perhaps they're in the hospital or in prison. We're glad to be there, reaching out, but if you're able to be in the Lord's house, that's where you belong.
[time=925] As a matter of fact, if you're going to church and don't have an evening service, we'd love to invite you to ours.
[time=931] Coming up in a few weeks, we have a special youth musical.
[time=934] Yes, Rick, many of our special programs take place on Sunday nights, and as Rick said, we encourage you if you don't have a regular place to worship in the evenings to come on Sunday evenings to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=946] Rick, we have a special youth musical coming up February 23rd. It's entitled Surrender.
[time=952] It is directed by Renee Longbreak and Rick Halls and our youth pastor, John Souch.
[time=957] It's a great musical concerning consecrating one's life to the Lord Jesus Christ and serving him wherever you are.
[time=964] It really has a great message. It'll be entertaining and a lot of fun for the people, and yet at the same time, the message will get across of our decision and what we need to do with our lives on a daily basis.
[time=975] Just before that Sunday evening service, for the next two Sunday services, we're going to be studying the topic, Death and Dying.
[time=983] And while that may not be a pleasant thought to entertain, it is certainly an appropriate one, the Bible makes it very clear that it is appointed under each of us once to die.
[time=994] How can we be prepared for that in every sense of the word? That's what we'll be studying, and if you're not going to church on Sunday nights, we would love to invite you to join us at six o'clock.
[time=1004] Here at Blackhawk Baptist Church. Today we want to share an excellent little pamphlet with you from my favorite author, Charles Swindall.
[time=1013] The booklet has the title Singleness. Today we live in a time when more and more people are single.
[time=1021] Some are remaining single out of choice and are never marrying because of divorce in our society. Many people are single again.
[time=1030] The Bible has a great deal to say about singleness, and that will be the topic of our morning message today as we study 1 Corinthians chapter 7.
[time=1039] So while we're on the topic, we wanted to share with you a pamphlet so that you could have a continuing insight into what God has to say.
[time=1047] If you're single and wanting to know what God has to say, or you have a friend who is in that position, it is a great position to be in.
[time=1056] What does God's Word have to say? We'd love to share it with you both in today's message and this booklet.
[time=1062] So if you'll write to us, we'll send you Pastor Swindall's book entitled Singleness, if you'll simply write to us today.
[time=1069] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1079] For the booklet Singleness, write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1088] You know, Rick, the book implies that it's just perhaps for those that are single, but I think it's imperative that those of us that are married understand what the Bible has to say about being single in today's society.
[time=1099] You know, Pete, that is so true because I am constantly influenced by other people, and I'm sure others are the same way.
[time=1107] And what a tragedy it would be if someone was falsely influenced to think that they should get married, and somehow that's a preferable state, and so because the pressure was on, they did that.
[time=1118] Or just the opposite, that someone thought it was more spiritual to be single, and they didn't marry if they really wanted to.
[time=1125] So this booklet gives us good insight as to what God's Word has to say, a final reference point.
[time=1131] We'd love for you to have a copy, so please do write to us today, we would love to hear from you, and we'd love to send you this booklet.
[time=1138] Peter address one final time, please.
[time=1140] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1148] Thank you for joining us today, and we trust that God will use this hour of ours together to strengthen your faith and to draw each of us closer to the Lord.
[time=1161] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=1319] Thank you, Dave and Debbie and Scott, draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, precious Lord.
[time=1328] Father, we would pray that today through this hour of worship, that you would draw us closer to you.
[time=1336] We pray for that one who has never taken the step of receiving Christ, that today they might take that first step.
[time=1345] Father, we pray for those who have received Christ as Savior in recent days, that they would continue to walk, taking additional steps of growth.
[time=1357] Father, we pray for those who have known Christ for a number of years now, that you'd keep them fresh and alive and vibrant with all the vitality and vigor of the days when they first knew Christ.
[time=1371] Father, we pray that you'll help them to take that step of ongoing growth.
[time=1377] Father, we pray that you'll help those who are in their senior years in their walk with Christ, that you'll keep them moving, keep them growing.
[time=1389] Don't allow any of us to retire from serving you. May our last day be our best one, draw us nearer, near a precious Lord.
[time=1403] Father, today we would pray that out of that nearness of walk with you we would find strength.
[time=1410] We pray for those who have lost loved ones. We pray for Karen, for Jim, for others who have lost tragically father.
[time=1424] We pray for those who have lost a partner.
[time=1429] We pray that you would be the God of all comfort to them.
[time=1434] That you would give to their life a revitalized sense of purpose in you.
[time=1443] We pray for those who have chronic afflictions of their health, for Ralph, for Marion, for Hazel, for Richard Hershey.
[time=1454] God, be by their side and give peace to troubled hearts.
[time=1460] Father, we pray for those who have felt this weak, the sting of rejection.
[time=1465] To those who have heard it said, "I don't want you, I don't need you." To those who have been more subtly squeezed out of their role.
[time=1474] Help them to sense their worth and acceptance before you.
[time=1479] Father, we pray for those who feel alienated from the whole.
[time=1484] Help us as a body to be absorbing with love, contagiously all of those who come here.
[time=1491] Not just those who seem to share the same general interest.
[time=1496] Make of us one body.
[time=1499] Father, today as we study your word we ask for insights that will channel our lives in a way that it gives direction like a lamp on our feet and a light onto our path.
[time=1512] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1517] Part of our worship is not only our singing and our praying and our studying, but it's our fellowship together.
[time=1525] We've been taking the time and our morning service to greet one another, and while that has become somewhat of a predictable part of our service, don't become stagnant and greeting each other.
[time=1536] As we do it here in the auditorium, we hope that that's just your first contact and that you'll carry the ball by being people-oriented people.
[time=1544] Right now, look for those around you who you don't know.
[time=1547] Introduce yourself and invite them to come back and sit with you if they're by themselves and don't let anyone be a stranger today.
[time=1554] Let's greet one another right now.
[time=1566] ♪
[time=1586] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1590] I think that it's critically important that we greet each other in our services. I believe it's critically important so that we're meeting each other and greeting each other and at least taking that first step collectively.
[time=1602] Secondly, it's critically important that I wake you up before the message, and I was about to lose some of you before we got started.
[time=1609] I'm glad that you're a live body of people. As we study the word, let's keep that freshness.
[time=1615] This morning, we're moving through the Brook of 1 Corinthians in the seventh chapter, and we come to a passage where Paul talks about the advantages of singleness.
[time=1628] Throughout the centuries, men and women have often bragged about what a noble calling singleness is.
[time=1634] Others have said marriage is the desirable state.
[time=1638] Over 2,000 years ago, a Greek philosopher said, "Why should I get married? When I can be a teacher, I'll leave the prolongation of the human race to someone else.
[time=1651] I would rather study than to add to the world two or three ugly-nosed brats."
[time=1657] Well, he was rather confirmed in his opinion of bachelorhood.
[time=1661] One little girl was being scolded by her mother for always listening in and eavesdropping on her Aunt Emma's prayers.
[time=1670] Aunt Emma had a bedroom there, and the little girl was always just kind of listening in.
[time=1675] The mother was always telling her to give Aunt Emma some privacy, give her some privacy.
[time=1680] The mother said, "Why are you always listening?" Well, a girl said, "Why aren't Emma's got an unusual way of praying?" She always ends her prayers by saying, "And Father, world without men, amen."
[time=1696] One British man was being told the statistics of the tremendous percentage of Americans who are choosing to remain single.
[time=1706] And the British man said, "That proves that America is still the land of the free." He was then told, "But more people still get married." And he said, "That proves that she's still the home of the brave just as much."
[time=1721] Well, for those of you who think that marriage is an honorable estate, and of course I do,
[time=1727] and you're going to hold out to the end, allow this to be an encouragement from the Hox genealogy.
[time=1733] My great Aunt Peg was a single college professor at Penn State University, retired at age 65,
[time=1743] began taking some senior citizens type trips, never married, never intended in marrying.
[time=1749] She flew to Tokyo, Japan, went from there to a port city, got on a ship with a group of other senior citizens
[time=1756] that took them to Okinawa, Japan's islands, that took them to Korea and Taiwan and back.
[time=1762] A long table was set up filled with these senior citizens, an absolute stranger by the name of Luther Hawkins sat down.
[time=1770] Some romantic music was playing in the background, and before they got up from that table, they were pledged and the wedding was planned.
[time=1779] At age 69, Aunt Peg married Uncle Luther, and they're both in their 80s and couldn't be happier today.
[time=1788] Well, whether you're single or married today, I believe you're in an honorable state.
[time=1794] But don't become extreme in your commitment.
[time=1797] There was a man by the name of Jean Polterone.
[time=1800] He was a French man sentenced to die on the gallows as a habitual thief.
[time=1806] The magistrate was going to let him live if one person would marry this habitual bachelor.
[time=1812] A volunteer stepped out in the crowd.
[time=1815] Jean Polterone looked at the volunteer and said, "Hangman, do your duty."
[time=1821] And he died in 1234.
[time=1824] I don't know whether you're single today and happy or not.
[time=1828] I don't know whether you're married and happy or not, but I believe God's word gives encouragement for both of us.
[time=1835] First Corinthians, chapter 7, verses 25 through the end of the chapter constitute our study today.
[time=1844] It's a lengthy passage.
[time=1845] Rather than read it, allow me to give you its principles, and then we'll look at the verses as we come to the principles.
[time=1852] Before we study this text, though, like a frame around a picture, let me give you four principles to guide our study today
[time=1861] so that we don't go off in a tangent in either direction.
[time=1864] Principle number one is this.
[time=1866] Singleness is held up in the scriptures as a noble state.
[time=1872] This passage that we're going to study this morning, the early verses of chapter 7, Paul's only example tell us that singleness is a noble state.
[time=1882] If you're single, you're in a great position as far as God is concerned.
[time=1887] Secondly, the Bible holds a marriage up to be equally as noble.
[time=1892] The Bible says that in the beginning God says it's not good that man should be alone, and so he created a mate, a partner, an instituted marriage.
[time=1901] Allow that to be a second border on our study today, that marriage is also a great calling.
[time=1909] A third wall to keep us from going astray is this.
[time=1914] The Bible very clearly tells us to neither forbid nor force marriage.
[time=1921] There were in Paul's day as there are in our day today men and women who are forbidding marriage.
[time=1929] They're saying don't ever marry.
[time=1931] Devote yourself solely to the Lord, and if you were really spiritual, you wouldn't have any needs.
[time=1939] You would find every need being met in the Lord, and they have a spiritual sense of condensation about them.
[time=1949] And they say don't ever marry.
[time=1952] On 1 Timothy chapter 4 Paul is trying to set straight the record that has been marred and twisted by some heretics,
[time=1960] and he said those false teachers, and as he lists their charges against them, one was they forbid marriage.
[time=1968] Don't ever forbid it.
[time=1970] But secondly, don't ever force it either.
[time=1974] Alexis de Tocqueville is credited for the statement that America thrives on the tyranny of the majority,
[time=1982] and the majority of those of us over 21 are married, and there becomes a very subtle pressure on the unmarried to conform.
[time=1991] If there's a wedding, and you're 25 years old and never been married, you won't escape the auditorium.
[time=2001] No matter how fleet of foot you are without someone saying hi, when's it going to be your turn?
[time=2010] That becomes a very, very subtle form of pressure that our society puts on people to say be like the rest of us.
[time=2020] When God may say be unique, be unique.
[time=2025] And then allow this to be our fourth and final frame that I want to say clearly, clearly, and unequivocally,
[time=2034] before we talk about the virtues of singleness that I am thrilled to be married and particularly to Kathy,
[time=2040] and if I could roll back the years nine years, I'd do it all again.
[time=2045] But now what does God have to say about singleness?
[time=2048] In this study, look at verses 25 and 26 to begin with.
[time=2053] Now about virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one by the Lord's mercy who is trustworthy.
[time=2063] Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are.
[time=2069] Now Paul's beginning a list of the advantages of remaining single.
[time=2074] But notice how he identifies, people he says, now to virgins.
[time=2078] You see, the Bible, when it holds up the value of being single, makes the assumption of purity.
[time=2085] So whenever God is placing a premium on singleness, he has already placed an equal premium on purity.
[time=2092] Don't ever think that, well, I'm not really in control sexually, but at least I'm single.
[time=2099] No, that's not at all the tenor of the Bible.
[time=2103] Purity is just expected if you're single.
[time=2107] Now if you are single, Paul says, here is advantage number one of being single, and he says, because of the present crises.
[time=2116] Now in Paul's day, being a believer in Christ was a significant commitment that uniquely made you stand out from society in an unpopular way.
[time=2131] I was listening to Jerry Falwell speak early this morning on television, and he was giving a report from George Gallup about the millions and millions of people in America today
[time=2141] who claim to be born again and who lean towards what you and I know as a fundamentalist position.
[time=2148] The numbers approached 50%.
[time=2151] While the facts may or may not be absolutely accurate, we do live in a time when being an evangelical Christian
[time=2160] is socially acceptable, but men and women, this is a unique point in time, and this is a unique country in history.
[time=2173] Paul's day, there was great hostility that began originally from the Jewish arena.
[time=2180] There were those who out of sincere motives in their loyalty to the Jewish tradition thought that Christ and the Christians were misleading people
[time=2189] and they began a persecution with enormous fervor.
[time=2193] Paul himself was the leader originally.
[time=2199] Stephen was the first martyr.
[time=2203] That opened a door to an error of martyrdom that spread beyond just the Jewish hostility.
[time=2213] According to Dr. Karen's a fine church historian, about the time that Paul's writing,
[time=2219] Christianity was declared religio elicita, which is a Latin statement for saying it became an illegal religion.
[time=2229] Prior to this time, Christianity was viewed and tolerated as a legal religion by Rome.
[time=2236] But by the time that Paul is now writing, it is being declared an illegal religion.
[time=2242] Paul has been suffering an increasing amount of persecution.
[time=2247] He listed in chapter 11 of 2 Corinthians, multiple imprisonment.
[time=2252] Why?
[time=2253] For being a Christian.
[time=2255] Multiple beatings.
[time=2256] Why?
[time=2257] For proclaiming Christ.
[time=2259] He was shipwrecked.
[time=2260] He was stoned nearly to death.
[time=2263] And Paul said, it's rough out there.
[time=2266] It's bad.
[time=2268] And Paul saying, I'm going through all of this, and I am so thankful that I'm not dragging a wife or children through all of these hurts.
[time=2278] Paul saying there is a crisis upon us.
[time=2281] And singleness allows us the freedom to serve without the fear of punishment reprisal against a family.
[time=2292] And you say, well, that's history. Yes, that was history. But that's also today.
[time=2299] You say, we live here in this comfortable country, and I thank God for this country.
[time=2305] But we fail to remember stories like Nate Saint, Jim Elliot, who were slaughtered by the Aka Indians just one generation ago.
[time=2318] We forget that there are missionaries today with a machete literally hacking their way into uncivilized parts of the world where they may not lead people to Christ before they end up being supper.
[time=2334] There are those today who sit behind an iron curtain or a bamboo curtain or who live in a country hostile to the gospel where they are literally suffering for Christ today.
[time=2350] Read Alexander Solzhenitians, Archipelago Gulag, and you will discover that Nero has been rivalled by Stalin and his followers.
[time=2365] In the end times, when is that? I don't know.
[time=2370] If somebody says they do, no, don't believe him because Jesus said no one knows.
[time=2375] But in that time, which could be eminent, there will be an increase of persecution even as those days approach.
[time=2383] And the Bible says that being single has a tremendous advantage.
[time=2388] Why? First of all, because of the present crisis.
[time=2393] Then there's a second reason. But before he gives us the second reason, he's got to keep us fenced in and thinking appropriately.
[time=2401] Verse 27 says, "Are you married? Don't seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Don't seek a wife."
[time=2410] Now, as Paul begins to unfold, all of these advantages of being single, don't say, "Yeah, that would be great to be single again.
[time=2417] I think I'll take Paul up on his advice. See ya, man. See ya, lady. I'm going to follow the Lord. I'm going to be single again."
[time=2424] Now, Paul's saying, "Oh, wait a minute. Don't apply this. The letter here is being addressed to those who are single, not those who are married."
[time=2434] Be saying, "So if you're married, stay married, but if you're single, don't go out and look for a wife. Go out and look for a husband."
[time=2443] He gives us a second reason why. Verse 28, "But if you do marry, you haven't sinned. It's not as though there's something sinful about marriage.
[time=2451] And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry," and here's the second point, "those who marry will face many troubles in this life."
[time=2462] I want to spare you this. I really believe what Paul is saying is, if you're single and you've got some problems, don't think that marriage is going to solve all of those problems.
[time=2474] Marriage has its own share of ups and downs. I have discovered that the engagement process can never be long enough.
[time=2486] It seems that couples, regardless of whether they're in their teens, are well beyond those years, when they're engaged, when they're dating, they wear glasses.
[time=2496] That, of course, have rose-colored lenses. And they only see the wonderful things, the attractive things, the positive things, and whatever problems lurk over the horizon, we'll find them together.
[time=2508] And, you know, they're just there, "Oh, man, it's going to be great, and we just love each other so much there aren't going to be any problems."
[time=2515] I've made an observation, not necessarily on my life, but just in life in general, that when we get married, we not only bring this wonderful, adoring person to the marriage,
[time=2525] but we bring what the Bible calls this old nature in it, too. And in most relationships, the old nature gets out of bed before the new nature does.
[time=2536] And marriage has as many problems as singleness does. I have a theory for everything from economics to chicken soup.
[time=2547] One of my theories is what I labeled the cycle of needs. All of us have needs. You may have a need for security.
[time=2554] This one may have a need for significance. This one may have a need for finances. This one may have a need for health.
[time=2560] This one may have a need because they're lonely. This one may have a need because their house is too crowded.
[time=2565] We all have a need, and the greatest need in anyone's life is the need that is presently unmet.
[time=2573] And so you're sitting here today, perhaps as a married person, and you've got three or four needs, and you're thinking, "I've got to meet those needs."
[time=2581] Well, it's like a cycle, and at the very top is the unmet need. But as soon as you meet that need, it cycles its way right down to the bottom, and now there's a brand new need.
[time=2591] And many people look at marriage from the outside and say, "But if I just had a mate, then the apartment wouldn't be empty when I came home.
[time=2599] There would be someone to share my joys with, someone to share my sorrows with, someone that I could talk to, someone who I could face tomorrow with.
[time=2607] And I've got this need for partnership, right up there at the top. And as soon as you meet that need by getting married, that thing goes clunk right down to the bottom, and there's a whole new need.
[time=2618] In our language today, we call it for space.
[time=2622] Oh, if I could just have my own bathroom back again. Every morning, it's a search for the brush and the comb.
[time=2630] Oh, you know, that's trite little stuff, but it's simply to say marriage has its problems as well. And Paul is saying, "I just want to warn you that singleness certainly as its disadvantages, but it has a few advantages just as much."
[time=2647] And Paul says, "Don't get caught up in that cycle of needs. I'm looking before you leave."
[time=2653] There's a story that is told at the expense of the ladies, and I hope I've told enough at the expense of the men that I'm not overly chauvinistic.
[time=2661] It's about a new organization that started called Marriage Anonymous.
[time=2665] Man said that he joined it, and his friend said, "Well, how does that work?" And it says, "Well, anytime you get the urge in the feeling you need to get married, you dial this number, and they send a lady over in curlers and cold cream who will talk to you forever until the urge passes away."
[time=2684] Oh, what's that joke? It's simply saying marriage has got problems. Kathy married me, and when she married me, she saw all of these strengths.
[time=2694] The next day, after the wedding, she saw all of these liabilities, and most of us are pretty good about camouflaging those into our security is in place.
[time=2705] Paul's saying singles, there's a whole 'nother life out there that you may not see, and singleness has its advantages, and marriage has its problems.
[time=2717] So Paul's upholding singleness. Why? Number one, because in his day, what he called the present crisis.
[time=2723] Two, because of the problems of marriage. And three, and this is really the point we're trying to get to, is that Paul says it can give you a priority on service.
[time=2733] Verses 29 through verses 31 talk about the fact that the time is short. Jesus could be coming at any day. He could have come before Paul's pen stopped etching on the page of 1 Corinthians.
[time=2750] Obviously, he did not. He could come before our service concludes this morning. Someone said, as long as this service goes, there's a real good chance of that.
[time=2761] We don't know when he's coming, but the Bible warns us to always be prepared because in God's calendar, the time is short. He could be here at any moment.
[time=2770] Paul says, so it's going to be soon that we're going to be living a life so temporarily. All of your investments, all of your buying, all of your joys, all of your sorrows, your marriages, your engagements, they're all going to be shelved.
[time=2781] The time is short, and so therefore use the time to serve. Look at verse 32.
[time=2788] I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs, how we can please the Lord, but a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how we can please his wife, and his interests are divided.
[time=2809] An unmarried woman, our virgin, is concerned about the Lord's affairs. Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord, both in body and spirit, but a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband.
[time=2823] I'm saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
[time=2833] I think what Paul is saying here is the single person has a unique advantage of service because marriage takes time. Children take time.
[time=2843] And God's not saying that's bad, he's just saying that is. And if you're single, you have greater mobility and greater time and greater resources to serve.
[time=2856] When I was a student at Talbot Seminary, I transferred after one year to Grace.
[time=2862] And when I arrived there, I met an old friend and went over to their home, had dinner with his wife and his family, and they said, "How do you move from Akron, Ohio to California to Winona Lake? How do you get all your stuff there?"
[time=2875] And I said, "Stuff, everything I own fits in the back seat of my Chevy. Have car, we'll travel." You know, there wasn't any stuff.
[time=2883] Now, for us to go away for two days, we have to take our station wagon into U-Haul. Man, when you're single, you've got mobility.
[time=2894] We had a single friend, and I said to a mutual friend, "Where's Bob?" Bob being single, and my friend said, "Nobody knows."
[time=2904] No, man, he was free to go. He was just, you know, if he wanted to go to Venezuela, he was gone. If he wanted to go to Florida, he was gone. Nobody knows where he's at.
[time=2913] Singleness has the advantage of mobility. It also has the advantages of time.
[time=2919] And please don't misunderstand. I believe this passage is underlining the fact that men, we need to spend time with our wives.
[time=2927] Wives, we need to spend time with our husbands. Parents, we need to spend time with our children. The Bible isn't in any way saying, "Oh, those little rugrats, you know, why'd we have them?"
[time=2938] That's not the spirit of the Word. The Word's saying, "We need that time together." But if you're not married, and if you don't have children, then all of that time can now be turned into opportunities to serve.
[time=2954] We spend an enormous amount of time in our lives taking care of the cares of this world.
[time=2962] The more we have, the more we need. It's one of the tragic cycles of life.
[time=2969] Most of us have so much stuff that we don't know what it is that we had to buy a bigger house to keep it because we didn't have time to sort it to throw it away.
[time=2978] What a cycle of life. And Paul's saying, "Man, when you're single, you're foot loose. You go and you forget all that stuff. You've got time to serve."
[time=2989] Now, one of the tragedies of the American society, as singleness, has risen in popularity, but for the wrong reason.
[time=2997] We're not saying single is great in America because we can serve. We're saying single is great because of self.
[time=3005] I don't want somebody crowding into my space. I don't want accountability to some husband, some wife.
[time=3013] I don't want a bunch of kids. I want to live my life. I want to spend my money on me.
[time=3021] After all, the one who dies with the most toys wins.
[time=3025] And so singleness gives me the chance to focus more on me. That isn't what God's saying at all here.
[time=3033] He's saying single isn't for self. It's for service.
[time=3037] He says that the man or the woman who is single should be taking the time that is available to them that married people don't have and make it available to the Lord for service.
[time=3054] Now, please don't misunderstand. God's not saying here that if you're married and if you have children that you've fallen into a lesser state and grudgingly spend a little time with them,
[time=3069] no, God's saying, "Of course, that's a part of life." But if you're single, use that time for service.
[time=3078] I think it's important then for us to recognize that we as part of a body of people need to honor each other's time.
[time=3089] I think sometimes we take people for granted. I know that I'm guilty.
[time=3094] An idea pops into my head, so suddenly I'm on the phone calling all of our deacons and saying, "Hey, I've got all this great idea."
[time=3104] We didn't stop to think that those men have wives who would love to see them with their eyes open.
[time=3111] They have children who would like to finish a meal without Dad having this growth out of his ear.
[time=3118] Let's be sensitive to each other in the demands of our time.
[time=3123] I know the spirit of our church. I know the spirit of our deacons.
[time=3127] I know the spirit of our teaching staff here in the Sunday school. I know the spirit of our Christian school teachers.
[time=3134] Every one of those people were here for each other and to serve each other, but let's also be sensitive that they may need the time with their family. That's biblical.
[time=3144] That lesson was driven home to me very clearly when I was at the home of a teacher one night, Saturday night,
[time=3151] 9 o'clock in the evening, time to relax, phone rings. It's a student. "Hey, teach? How do you spell Mesopotamia?"
[time=3158] That could grief. You know, people just think that other people are vending machines.
[time=3164] You know, they just come in, drop in their requests, kick it if it doesn't work and go on their way.
[time=3170] Make sure you're a person who is available to people, but then also make sure you're a person who's sensitive to people.
[time=3178] If there's someone who's come into your life who's been your friend, maybe it's the outreach director in your group.
[time=3184] Maybe it's somebody who you're in a support group with or you work with.
[time=3188] We're here for each other, but never take advantage of that person. I'm too often too guilty.
[time=3195] Our time is for service, but we've got to balance that with the needs of family, for those who have family.
[time=3202] And don't ever forget that single person may not have a family, but they also need some time alone.
[time=3209] Let's not run them into the ground by saying, "Oh, great, they're single. They can do it. Maybe they can. Maybe they need a little time, too."
[time=3218] But all that Paul is boiling this down to say is this. If you're single, that gives you a strategic edge, a strategic edge for service.
[time=3230] In the last few verses he addresses two particular situations. There was the practice of "betrothal."
[time=3237] It was a far more binding commitment than engagement is, so it's hard for us to get the parallel in our thinking.
[time=3245] And what if you were betrothed? You were engaged to this person.
[time=3252] The engagement has already gone to the point where there have been an exchange of resources and public pledges of marriage.
[time=3261] Maybe even a dowry that has been exchanged. And suddenly the apostle Paul writes and says, "Stay single! What do you do?
[time=3269] Do you break that betrothed, or do you go ahead and marry?" Paul said, "Yes."
[time=3276] He said, "If you're engaged, betrothed, and you now see the inside of being single, and you can with honor break that, then break it and stay single.
[time=3286] But if you feel like that's dishonorable and you want to marry, then marry. Either way you haven't sinned."
[time=3293] I think that has a good application to us.
[time=3296] I think what the word is here saying is if you're not happy single, if God hasn't given you contentment and you've really sought for it,
[time=3305] then don't resist marriage. But if God's given you a contentment with your singleness, then hang on to it.
[time=3314] Then he addresses finally in the last few verses those who have unfortunately lost their loved ones.
[time=3321] Many of you have done that. We cannot underline too heavily the hurt that is involved there.
[time=3327] For most of us, when our mate dies, we lose not only our partner, but our purpose.
[time=3334] For some, their mate's death has been very slow because of a prolonged illness.
[time=3340] And so during those last days and years, it's been their job to care for this mate.
[time=3345] And now when that mate dies, they've not only lost their partner, but their purpose in life was to care for them.
[time=3351] Others, their very purpose of going to work every day was to provide for their family.
[time=3357] And when that family is gone, when that mate has died, they say, "Who cares anymore?" The purpose is gone.
[time=3366] For a wife being that team member and perhaps number one cheerleader, when there's no team to cheer for,
[time=3373] it's not only just a partner that's gone, it's been a purpose. It's a deep hurt.
[time=3378] Paul says to those, he gives one suggestion and one command. The suggestion is, if you can, stay single.
[time=3385] Number two, if you choose the command is this, marry only someone in the Lord.
[time=3392] Let me try to tie this all together very quickly in a few quick principles.
[time=3397] Principle number one is this, if you're seeking a mate, stop.
[time=3402] Seek the Lord. And if in seeking him, he brings a mate in your life, then it's his wolf.
[time=3407] He doesn't, then that's his wolf, but don't be a mate seeker.
[time=3411] There's nothing more tragic than the multitudes of people who get engaged their senior year of college
[time=3417] because they feel like they're leaving the happy hunting grounds.
[time=3421] If you're seeking a mate, stop.
[time=3424] Chuck Swindall gives these three points of advice.
[time=3427] First of all, rejoice in your singleness. Secondly, relax.
[time=3431] Don't strain yourself finding a mate. Thirdly, replace that energy with service.
[time=3437] Principle number two is this, if you're single, don't be single for yourself.
[time=3442] Be single for the sake of service. And finally, whether we're single or married, we're one body.
[time=3451] Let's strengthen each other. Let's bond ourselves together.
[time=3455] As marriage, let's have a ministry to the singles. They're having a ministry to us.
[time=3460] But all this boils down first and foremost to having Christ at the center of your life because his word won't make sense unless he's at the hub.
[time=3469] Is Christ at the hub of your life, if he's not today, you can open up your heart and invite him in.
[time=3475] I pray that you'll do that and do it now.
[time=3485] [MUSIC]
