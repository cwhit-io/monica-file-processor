[time=93] [MUSIC]
[time=112] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=115] And now from the convocation center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from a sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and the message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=130] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=132] (choir singing)
[time=152] - Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=156] - I will bless the Lord at all times.
[time=160] His praise shall continually be on my mouth.
[time=164] My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.
[time=168] The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
[time=172] O magnify the Lord with me.
[time=174] Come, let us exalt His name together.
[time=180] We want to welcome you to our morning worship service today, and trust in your heart that you've assembled with us today to give praise and to glorify the name of our God and Savior
[time=192] and of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=194] Welcome today, and to you friends who join us by way of television, thank you for the privilege of extending the ministry of music and of God's Word beyond our auditorium into your life.
[time=206] This morning, our choir leads us with an anthem of praise, a medley of songs that brings glory to the name of God.
[time=214] (music playing)
[time=234] - O Lord, my God, in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty.
[time=238] He will say, "We will rejoice or lead with joy." He will rest His own.
[time=244] He will show Him to see.
[time=246] O Lord, my God, in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=258] He will say, "We will rejoice or lead with joy." He will rest His own.
[time=264] He will show Him to see.
[time=266] O Lord, my God, in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=270] He is mighty, is mighty.
[time=274] O Lord, my God, in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty.
[time=752] Today, we would like to take a few moments to talk with our friends like you who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=760] Right now, some announcements and our offering are taking place here in the worship service.
[time=766] And this gives us a few moments just to say hello to you.
[time=768] Good morning, Pete.
[time=770] Good morning, Rick.
[time=770] How are you this morning?
[time=772] I'm doing fine recovering from a snow day that we played too much basketball and then a high school retreat.
[time=776] That kept you busy for the weekend.
[time=778] Funny about you. Well, we had a good time yesterday going over to Bishop Lures High School.
[time=784] Many of our young people who attend our church and Black Hawk Christian school participated in the Isma solo and ensemble contest.
[time=792] And I was delighted to watch several of our kids and see them develop musically.
[time=798] And then even to see some of our Bible Hour listeners, there was a shuttle bus.
[time=802] And as we rode the shuttle bus from the shopping center to the school, several of the people said that they watched the Bible Hour
[time=808] and then go to their own church service.
[time=810] You know, I had a very similar experience.
[time=812] While I was on this high school retreat, I was speaking for the Defiance, Ohio area, Youth for Christ.
[time=818] We had a great time with these young people.
[time=820] And it was such an encouragement to me that many of these high school students were Bible Hour viewers too.
[time=824] Not just adults, but young people are watching and they're looking for a message that is life-changing.
[time=832] That's exciting, Rick.
[time=832] And that's pleasing to us to hear that because I think our young people really do listen for God's Word and for God's direction in their life.
[time=840] Well, that was a joy for me just as it was for you at the In Thisma contest yesterday.
[time=844] Today, we'd like to share a booklet with you and encourage you to write in for this booklet.
[time=850] You may be married and say, "Why would I want a book titled Singleness?"
[time=856] Well, perhaps you've got a friend who's single, perhaps you're working with some friends who are singles, or perhaps you have children,
[time=862] and you need to know what God's Word has to say about singleness.
[time=866] There's just a prevailing assumption that everyone will follow the typical pattern of getting married,
[time=872] having 2.2 children, a station wagon, a dog, and a color TV, sort of the American way.
[time=878] And I'm certainly not knocking that.
[time=880] Except for to say this, God's Word puts a special value on being single and using that extra time for the kingdom's sake.
[time=892] We'd like to send you this booklet.
[time=892] I'm particularly pleased because it is so well written and comes from my favorite author, Charles Windall.
[time=900] If you'll write for a copy, we'll be glad to send you one, even today.
[time=904] Let me encourage you to write for the booklet Singleness by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=916] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=924] Pete, just this morning as I was walking down the hall to come here, one of the single gals in our church said,
[time=930] "Thank you for last Sunday morning's message about singleness, this same topic." She said, "So often people think we're in a hold pattern.
[time=938] We're just waiting till we find Mr. Wright." And she said, "I'm single by choice." And I believe God's Word says that many of us can have the unique opportunity of service by remaining single.
[time=950] While I was on this retreat, I met a gentleman who's exactly my age, and he is single, and he spends literally every night instead of chasing children, which I'm not putting down,
[time=960] taking care of some of the needs of a great ministry over in Ohio.
[time=964] There's a lot of value there.
[time=966] Our singles ministry begins early in the morning, on Sunday morning.
[time=968] In fact, some of our young men are here about 730 getting the room prepared,
[time=974] some of the ladies and even men are in cooking a brief breakfast for the singles that come,
[time=980] and they have a great time of fellowship.
[time=982] Looks like they had a good group there even this morning very early.
[time=984] Well, we want to encourage you to write for the booklet, of course, but even if you don't sense an interest in that booklet,
[time=992] we would love to hear from you.
[time=994] We meet many of you in the hospitals and in the malls and places that we're at, but we would just love to know you're there.
[time=1000] May I encourage you one final time to write and write to us today.
[time=1004] Our address once again is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1016] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1018] Pete, we're going back to our morning service, and what should we be looking forward to musically?
[time=1022] Well, most importantly, this is Paul Turner's last Sunday.
[time=1024] Our company is, he's been with us for about 16 months.
[time=1028] He's moving to North Carolina, and he'll be playing a duet with Scott Schindler, our organist, and this is Paul's last Sunday.
[time=1034] We regret that fact, but we're grateful that we had him here for a time to use his ministry in music.
[time=1040] Well, to Paul and Jeanie, a well-earned appreciation and thanks from us to them,
[time=1046] and to you for joining us today.
[time=1062] [MUSIC - 272 seconds]
[time=1345] (audience applauds)
[time=1360] - Thank you, Father, we are standing in Your presence today.
[time=1364] It is ground that You have made Holy by the person of Your Son, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1373] And we have come today to worship Him and to thank Him for the cleansing.
[time=1378] That You have taken us.
[time=1380] We who are sinners and You've washed us.
[time=1382] You've made us clean.
[time=1384] You've declared us to be set apart and to be holy.
[time=1388] God, we know we are not holy, but You have declared us to be by forgiveness today.
[time=1394] And we've come to this place to worship You and to magnify Your name.
[time=1399] We sense Your presence in this place.
[time=1402] And You today have blessed us by being here in Your Spirit and in truth.
[time=1409] And You have made this Holy ground.
[time=1412] Father, as we meet this morning, we meet sensing that is the very purpose of our life to praise You, that You have made us and made us for Yourself.
[time=1422] And God, we're finding fulfillment today in the exaltation of Your name.
[time=1428] And while we meet Father, we would ask You to put within us a spirit of confidence as we face life to know that You walk with us, that You are our companion, the one who would give life and who would give light to our living.
[time=1446] And so this morning we pray for strength for this body.
[time=1450] We pray for those who face physical health.
[time=1454] We pray this morning for Sandy Ewing, for Richard Hershey,
[time=1460] for men and women whose bodies are torn by cancer,
[time=1466] weak hearts, pancreatitis, colitis.
[time=1473] Father, the body of Christ today suffers when our members suffer, and so we pray for the beloved.
[time=1480] We pray for Mary, we pray for Ralph Kramer.
[time=1485] Pray for Ray Stettler today.
[time=1490] Father, we would pray for Roy Wood that You would walk by the sides of these friends and strengthen them, give hope to their hearts.
[time=1498] Father, for those who are going through the pain of rejection, we pray that You would comfort them.
[time=1506] Many have given trust and found that trust to be broken, by a date, by a son or a daughter, or a husband or a wife, or a fianc√©e.
[time=1519] God help us to know that in the rejections of life that You're always there accepting us and healing.
[time=1528] Father, today, we pray for teens who are in turmoil, that You would give to young people a vision of life in Jesus Christ, that they might not become slaves to the opportunities of this world that would seek not to build but to destroy, give wisdom to our youth.
[time=1550] In this morning, Father, we would pray that You would minister to each of our hearts through Your Word and through song, teach us to be still, my soul, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1564] God has blessed this church with an extraordinary number
[time=1572] of people who are willing to serve, and you're a part of that.
[time=1576] Paul and Jeannie Turner have been a part of our church, moved to Florida, and then moved back here, but unfortunately, they're moving again.
[time=1583] And this will be Paul's last Sunday with us on the piano, and so he is going to play a song and accompanied by Scott, "Be Still, My Soul." (gentle music)
[time=1613] (gentle music)
[time=1696] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=1713] (gentle music)
[time=1727] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=1742] (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=1755] (gentle music)
[time=1762] (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=1785] (applause)
[time=1801] Paul and Jeannie, that ovation, is not only for a song today, but for a ministry and a life of sacrifice.
[time=1809] We certainly appreciate the turners and wish that they were going to be with us longer.
[time=1814] And I wish that we had an ability to recognize each one of you, who so faithfully, like Paul and Jeannie, have served the Lord here.
[time=1822] God, you have commanded us this morning through a piano to be still.
[time=1828] To be still, my soul.
[time=1831] So God is, we are still and quiet.
[time=1834] We ask you to speak.
[time=1836] God, give a message today.
[time=1839] Message from you.
[time=1841] Not simply the words of a preacher.
[time=1844] This one in particular.
[time=1847] But God, you speak this morning.
[time=1851] In Jesus' name.
[time=1853] [AMEN] If you have a Bible, please open it to the Book of 1 Corinthians and the 8th chapter.
[time=1861] Many of you have been worshiping with us and studying with us, and we have been working our way through the Book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1868] Chapter 7 marked a transition in that book.
[time=1872] Paul is now beginning with chapter 7, verse 1, answering a series of questions that the Corinthians had written to them about.
[time=1882] How do we know that?
[time=1883] Well, in chapter 7, verse 1, it says, "Now concerning the things which you wrote unto me." They wrote, he's now writing back, and their first question obviously dealt with the areas of marriage, divorce, singleness, and sex.
[time=1898] And so we studied through that in chapter 7.
[time=1901] Chapter 8 begins with a continuation of that theme that he is writing in response to their inquiry.
[time=1909] He says, "Now as touching things offered to idols, you know that we all have knowledge, but knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
[time=1922] And if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
[time=1931] Verse 3, "But if any man loved God, the same is known of him.
[time=1937] As concerning, therefore, the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no other God but one.
[time=1955] For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many and lords many, but there to us is but one God, the father of whom all things and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things and we by him.
[time=1981] However, there is not in every man that knowledge, for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour, eat it as a thing offered unto an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
[time=1998] But food can dim with us not to God,
[time=2004] for neither if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse.
[time=2012] But take heed, last by any means, this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.
[time=2020] For if any man see thee who has this knowledge, sitting at the table in an idols temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols.
[time=2037] And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom Christ died, but when ye sin so against the brother and wound their conscience, ye sin against Christ.
[time=2055] Wherefore, if food make thy brother to offend, I will eat no meat while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
[time=2067] Paul is writing now about a question the Corinthians had raised.
[time=2071] They said, Paul, what about meat that's been offered to idols?
[time=2075] Is it all right to eat it?
[time=2079] Well, to be quite honest, most of us are doing a little bit of head scratching saying, how irrelevant.
[time=2086] I mean, we don't have any temples, we don't have any idols.
[time=2090] Most of the meat that I've bought in it, Rogers and Kroger's and the other stores have never seen the hands of Aphrodite.
[time=2097] I mean, you know, what's the point today?
[time=2100] Well, this is what we might call a gray area, a sticky subject.
[time=2106] You see, there are things in life that God has clearly commanded that we are to do these things.
[time=2112] The Bible says we're to assemble together.
[time=2114] The Bible says we're to believe on Christ.
[time=2117] The Bible says we're to love God.
[time=2119] The Scripture teaches us that we have a responsibility to love each other and to encourage each other.
[time=2124] God has made a list of commandments and said, do these.
[time=2128] God's made a second list, too.
[time=2130] And He said, don't do these, don't lie.
[time=2133] Don't be sexually involved with someone other than you're made.
[time=2136] Don't steal, don't lie to someone about somebody else.
[time=2140] That's gossip.
[time=2141] God said, don't do these.
[time=2143] And He said, do do these.
[time=2144] But to be honest, there's some middle ground isn't there.
[time=2147] There are some issues that we face in our society today and there are Christians lined up and said, I'm going to fight for this one and nobody better do that.
[time=2157] There are other side of that same coin.
[time=2159] People say, I don't think that's the way it is at all.
[time=2163] Well, some of those issues are drinking alcoholic beverages.
[time=2167] No place in the Bible.
[time=2168] It says, thou shall never.
[time=2171] What do you do with that difficult issue?
[time=2174] There's no place in the Bible that I know of that it speaks against smoking.
[time=2178] The only passage that I know of that speaks about smoking is somewhat positive.
[time=2183] It said, when Isaac saw his wife to be coming from afar, that he lit up on a camel.
[time=2190] That is the only reference to smoking that I know about in the Bible.
[time=2195] Now, someone else will come along and they'll say, smoking is clearly wrong because if God meant for us to smoke, he would have designed us with chimneys and that's their proof that smoking is absolutely wrong.
[time=2209] Well, that's a gray area.
[time=2211] Someone else says, well, what about going to movies?
[time=2214] This one says, I'm not going to go to any movies because the whole Hollywood syndrome is decadent.
[time=2221] Someone else says, well, there's a few good ones out there and if those of us who have moral convictions would go to the good ones then Hollywood would produce some more good movies.
[time=2230] Mm, sticky subjects.
[time=2233] You know, and what is so interesting, what this little group over here finds to be such a critical issue, this group over here says, what are those guys talking about?
[time=2244] And these guys over here, they've got their own little list and these guys are saying, man, they're crazy.
[time=2250] I had the privilege of going to five different colleges.
[time=2255] I made a deal, if they promised to pass me, I promised not to come back and it just worked out that way.
[time=2261] One of the schools that I had the great privilege of going to was a Lutheran seminary.
[time=2266] Now, I was a Baptist pastor at that time.
[time=2269] I took a course in Christian social ethics and we looked at four issues, abortion, that made sense for us to be talking about that.
[time=2278] You, the nation, that made sense to talk about that one.
[time=2282] And lying, is it ever right to hide a Jew in your closet when the Nazis are outside?
[time=2288] Do you lie to them or do you say, come on in, they're in the attic?
[time=2291] Is it ever right to lie?
[time=2292] That made sense to talk about that one.
[time=2294] And then the fourth thing we talked about was the common cup.
[time=2298] Man, I did a double take.
[time=2300] What are you talking about?
[time=2302] Well, you see, in that Lutheran circle, whether you serve communion in a lot of little cups or one big cup was very important.
[time=2308] And I'm saying, what's going on?
[time=2311] To them, that was really important.
[time=2313] The next class I took at that same school, there were ten of us.
[time=2317] They put ten topics in a hat.
[time=2319] Everybody is Lutheran in the place, except for me.
[time=2323] I draw mine out of the hat.
[time=2325] You guessed it, baptism.
[time=2329] And here I am making these impassioned speeches about immersion.
[time=2334] And these Lutherans, brethren are going, what's this guy talking about?
[time=2338] You know, what's the big deal?
[time=2340] Perhaps you've heard the story about the Presbyterian and the Baptist pastors arguing over the modes and methods of baptism.
[time=2347] And the Presbyterian said, do you mean for me to be legitimately baptized?
[time=2352] I've got to go down to a river or a pool or a baptistry and I've got to get dunked all the way.
[time=2357] The Baptist said, that's right.
[time=2359] He said, well, how about if I just get in up to here?
[time=2361] And the Baptist said, oh, no, that won't do.
[time=2364] Well, the Presbyterian said, well, how about if I go all the way up to here?
[time=2369] No, said the Baptist, assuring him, that won't do.
[time=2373] The Presbyterian said, well, how about if I get right up to here?
[time=2377] That won't do.
[time=2379] The Presbyterian said, so I've got to get wet right here.
[time=2383] The Baptist said, that's right.
[time=2385] And the Presbyterian said, that's what we do every time we baptize somebody.
[time=2388] We put the water right there.
[time=2391] And to us, that's really important, isn't it?
[time=2395] You know, we believe in immersion.
[time=2398] Somebody else said, well, I don't know.
[time=2402] We have all these little cups.
[time=2404] I think we have a thousand of these little cups to serve communion.
[time=2407] God bless the dear people after wash all those little cups.
[time=2411] The Lutherans owe to them, it's really important that you have this common cup.
[time=2414] You see, what's an issue to you?
[time=2416] I may not find any problem with.
[time=2418] And what I am really concerned about, you may not have a problem with.
[time=2422] And what this passage is saying is there are some middle issues.
[time=2426] And how will we handle these sticky subjects?
[time=2431] What principles are there?
[time=2433] Well, chapters eight, nine, and ten do not represent our study this morning.
[time=2439] But they represent Paul's answer to this situation.
[time=2443] Now, for the Corinthians, they had a major problem about eating meat
[time=2449] that had been offered to a pagan idol.
[time=2452] There were those that said, hey, eat, no big deal.
[time=2456] Jesus said it's not what goes into a man that defiles him, it's what comes out.
[time=2461] Just eat it.
[time=2462] Somebody else said, oh, I don't know.
[time=2464] You know, you're associating with these pagans and you're getting involved in their ritual and you're honoring their worship and we better just stay away.
[time=2472] Well, this whole meat issue posed three particular problems to the early church.
[time=2479] Problem number one centered around what we would call a private sacrifice.
[time=2483] This was not a public worship.
[time=2485] This was a private sacrifice of one individual in private.
[time=2489] Now, these people had a good sense of economics.
[time=2492] When they sacrificed an animal, they didn't put the animal up there and burned the whole thing.
[time=2496] They would only put a small part, even a token.
[time=2499] It could be something as small as just a few of the hairs off of the animal's forehead.
[time=2504] That's all that was sacrificed.
[time=2506] Then what they would do with the meat of the animal is they would divide that.
[time=2511] Part of it would go to the priests.
[time=2514] And the other part of it would go back to the man or woman who made the sacrifice, who then in turn would hold a banquet.
[time=2522] Now, there may be some special occasion for the banquet, like a wedding or a holiday, or it may just be a Saturday night banquet.
[time=2530] And what they would do is they would sacrifice some token of the animal, and give the priests their portion.
[time=2537] Then they would sponsor a banquet that they're going to use this meat to serve, and an invitation would go out.
[time=2542] It might read something like this.
[time=2544] Polisigundus invites you to dine with him in the temple of our goddess,
[time=2551] Aphrodite, there to feast and to worship.
[time=2556] Well, are you going to go?
[time=2558] I mean, to half a society, it's just a banquet.
[time=2561] It's like going to the elks or the moose lodge.
[time=2564] But to another group, people say, "Wow, that is the temple of Aphrodite." And right there on the invitation, it says, "To feast and to worship."
[time=2574] The problem was, "Do you go?" Well, there was a second problem.
[time=2579] This one centered around the public sacrifice.
[time=2581] In their worship services, an animal would be brought in, slaughtered, and then some part of the animal would be burnt as a sacrifice.
[time=2590] And the whole animal itself would be retained for its food value.
[time=2594] The priests would take their portion, and then because it was a public sacrifice, the meat would either be sold out of the temple or sold to meat markets.
[time=2605] Now, the problem was this.
[time=2607] When you go to the meat market, you don't know whether this meat has been dedicated to an idol or not.
[time=2613] And if you do, do you buy it?
[time=2615] But there's even a greater problem.
[time=2617] Suppose you're on your way, and you go past the local meat martin, and their Demetrius is selling meat for $1.19 a pound.
[time=2627] But as you're on your way to Demetrius, you pass the temple, and there the priests are selling this meat.
[time=2632] It's just as good as meat, just as fresh, for 89 cents a pound.
[time=2639] Do you buy it and save the 30 cents?
[time=2646] Or do you go on to Demetrius's meat market and buy it there?
[time=2650] Well, someone said, "Of course, you pass by that temple.
[time=2654] You don't even want to be seen there." Someone else said, "Oh, no, you buy it.
[time=2659] You save the 30 cents and you send it to missions." That's a tough subject for them.
[time=2666] There was an either-and-bigger problem, though, and that was the problem that centered around an invitation to someone's house.
[time=2675] You might go to someone's house, friend of yours, business associate,
[time=2681] sit down to eat, and they say, "Just before we eat, let me pray."
[time=2688] And this pagan says, "Dear God Zeus, we beseech you to bless this meat,
[time=2699] and Zeus, we pray that you will drive all of the evil spirits out of this meat,
[time=2707] and we now dedicate this meat to you and us to your service, O Zeus, amen."
[time=2715] Wow. Now what do you do?
[time=2719] And that's exactly what happened.
[time=2721] You see, these people believe that there were evil spirits everywhere.
[time=2726] And the way that the evil spirit got into you was the evil spirit was in the meat.
[time=2732] And if you ate meat, then that evil spirit got in you.
[time=2737] But if you ask the patron God or goddess of your city to get the evil spirits out and dedicate the meat to that being, then it's alright to go ahead and eat it.
[time=2748] You can see this was a pretty sensitive issue.
[time=2753] Now Paul's going to start to give some guidance to sort your way through this.
[time=2759] But he gives some key warnings right up front about knowledge.
[time=2764] You know, the question is, how do we know what to do?
[time=2767] And Paul's response is, yeah, knowledge is important, but knowledge has some limitations and dangers.
[time=2773] He begins by saying, "We all have knowledge, and knowledge is important." Paul prayed for the Church of Colossia, said that I pray that you might increase in knowledge and wisdom.
[time=2785] There's a spiritual gift of knowledge listed in the Bible.
[time=2790] John said, "I write these things unto you that you may know.
[time=2794] God wants us to have knowledge." Paul wrote countless times, not countless times, but several times in the Scripture saying, "I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren." Or Methodist or Baptist, not just the brethren.
[time=2807] He said, "I want you to know something here." Knowledge is important in the Scripture.
[time=2813] Yet even knowledge has limitations, and he gives us two of those.
[time=2818] Verse 1, he says, "We all have knowledge, but knowledge puffs up."
[time=2824] What's he saying there?
[time=2826] Knowledge, the more we know, the more prone we are to trust in our own wisdom,
[time=2832] and we become somewhat self-sufficient and arrogant.
[time=2836] We have an inflated ego.
[time=2838] That's what the word puffed up means, because we think we know something.
[time=2842] Isn't it a frustration to be around someone who is relatively smart?
[time=2846] They know a lot, and one of the things that they know is that they know a lot.
[time=2852] And they love to make sure that you know that they know.
[time=2857] There's just this subtle air of superiority around them because they know.
[time=2865] Paul says, "Be careful with knowledge, because you may know something, and what you know may be right, but it is a very subtle position that can slip into arrogance."
[time=2876] And arrogance is the preceding step to sin.
[time=2881] The Bible says, "Beware when you think you stand, lest you fall,
[time=2887] because pride comes before the fall." And Paul hears warning the Corinthians, "There's some things we can talk about that we know, but remember, knowledge has a limited danger." It puffs up.
[time=2903] Then secondly, he said, "Even though we know something, not only does knowledge lead to arrogance,
[time=2909] knowledge is always at best partial." Knowledge is always at best partial.
[time=2918] Verse 2 says, "If any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
[time=2928] Very simple statement just saying, "Yes, you do know something, but you haven't begun to scratch the surface of knowledge." God's knowledge, the Bible says, is unsearchable, past finding out.
[time=2942] And our knowledge is always at best partial.
[time=2947] And we never know everything that we think we know.
[time=2952] The Bible here is warning us about being self-sufficient and superior in our knowledge.
[time=2962] And now he begins to address some of the things that we do know.
[time=2966] Verse 4 says, "Now concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know."
[time=2975] He's going to the knowledge.
[time=2977] He says, "What is it that we know?" He says, "We know that an idol is nothing in this world and that there is no other God but one."
[time=2986] He is saying, "Obviously God is God and there is only one God that we worship.
[time=2992] And an idol is nothing more than a piece of stone or a piece of marble or a piece of wood.
[time=2997] No matter how beautifully shaped, it is nothing.
[time=3001] It is absolutely nothing. And we know that.
[time=3005] And the obvious conclusion is, "Well, if an idol is nothing, then a sacrifice to an idol means nothing." And go ahead and eat it. We know that.
[time=3015] But Paul says, "Remember, knowledge has him in inherent dangers."
[time=3022] So in verse 5 he makes a difficult statement to interpret.
[time=3027] He says, "For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many and lords many."
[time=3036] Wait a minute, Paul, you just said there is only one God. Now you say there are many gods.
[time=3041] I think what he is saying is this, that there is only one true God.
[time=3046] But look at all these other gods, many of them, that people are worshiping.
[time=3051] And while they're not true gods, I believe what he is saying is there is a spirit that is alive and working
[time=3060] that is motivating people to worship these gods and that spirit is Satan and is many demons.
[time=3067] That's not to say there's a demon in this idol and there's two in that big idol over there.
[time=3071] It's just simply to say that if there is demonic, satanic influence on earth and in heaven, that's where Lucifer fell,
[time=3079] that is influencing people away from God.
[time=3083] So even though we know that an idol is nothing, there are still powers out there that are influencing people and that are real.
[time=3092] So in verse 6 he comes back and says, "But to us it is obvious, it is clear that there is no one God but the Father."
[time=3103] These are spirit beings, but there is really only one God who everything has been made by him and we're in him.
[time=3111] And his son Jesus Christ by whom all things exist and we buy him.
[time=3117] So in verse 7 he says, "However, there is not in every man that knowledge."
[time=3123] He's saying, "We know that an idol is nothing but not everybody understands that."
[time=3130] There are some people who were, if you'll pardon the modern day expression, saved out of a life of idolatry.
[time=3137] And while they may know that an idol is just stone, they're saying, "There is some real power though because I was held into bondage by the sin."
[time=3146] Don't tell me there's nothing to it, I know there's something to it.
[time=3151] And see, they don't have the knowledge yet of saying, "Yes, but that wasn't anything to do with the idol, it was just your sinful nature and Satan."
[time=3159] They don't have that knowledge yet.
[time=3162] So because they lack that knowledge, what you know, they don't know.
[time=3168] And when you live according to your knowledge, you're creating a very difficult situation for them to comprehend.
[time=3176] Verse 7 says, "Not everyone has this knowledge for some with a conscience of the idol unto this very hour."
[time=3184] That means right now they're still hung up on this idol business.
[time=3188] It is a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience is weak and is defiled.
[time=3196] What they're saying by the word weak, it simply means they're still in the process of growing spiritually, and of course all of us are always in the process.
[time=3205] But they're at a point where all these little things really struggle at them.
[time=3210] They nip at their heels, and the very thought of being anywhere close to a pagan temple really rattles their cage.
[time=3218] And for them to do any of that would really cause them to stumble.
[time=3223] Now in verse 8, he makes a very clear statement.
[time=3226] He said, "Those who eat are no more spiritual than those who don't eat, and those who don't eat aren't any better than those who do."
[time=3235] So let's not get spiritual about what we do and don't do.
[time=3240] Sometimes we use different religious observances like a badge.
[time=3247] We think if we don't do this, then everyone will know we're a Christian.
[time=3252] Or if we do this, everyone will be sure to know that we love Jesus.
[time=3257] And I believe the Bible here is saying, "Hey, you're no better if you do, and you're no better if you don't."
[time=3265] And I believe the Bible warns us not to parade our religion in a way to get attention to people.
[time=3273] I heard a speaker, and he's basically a good man, but he went on long lengthy dissertations about how every time you eat in public, you make sure you bow your head and pray.
[time=3284] And don't pray this silent prayer while I pray right out loud.
[time=3288] Let the world know you love Jesus.
[time=3290] I mean, he went on and on.
[time=3293] You know, if you want to pray, that's fine.
[time=3296] But if you don't pray, that's all right.
[time=3298] As long as you have a thankful heart, you know, sometimes we think if we pray, everyone will know we're a Christian.
[time=3305] That's not true.
[time=3306] These pagans prayed to get demons out of their meat.
[time=3309] When I was at Talbot Seminary, one of the other five schools I went to, my friend and I went out to eat.
[time=3315] And as our habit was, we just kind of bowed our head, acted like we had a headache, and he said a silent prayer.
[time=3321] And then we ate.
[time=3322] Well, we didn't know up at a table or two away.
[time=3325] A dear, sweet little elderly lady was watching.
[time=3328] And about halfway through our meal, she finished hers, and she walked over and said, "You're such nice, boys.
[time=3334] I saw you pray.
[time=3336] I know what you are.
[time=3338] You're Mormons." We didn't know.
[time=3342] She missed the whole point.
[time=3344] You know, we weren't praying to make a point, but you never know what someone's reading.
[time=3348] And so if you're saying, "I'm going to show the world I'm spiritual because I don't," you're no better than the guy who does.
[time=3356] Whether you eat the meat or you don't eat the meat, or whatever the issue is in your life.
[time=3362] And he gives us this one prevailing principle in verse nine.
[time=3368] It says this, "But take heed, last by any means, this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those that are weak."
[time=3379] He's saying, "None of us live in a vacuum.
[time=3383] All of us have windows on our life, and someone is quite often peeking in.
[time=3390] And I cannot say, "Well, I have a clean conscience, and I feel free to do this.
[time=3395] Therefore, I'll do it, and that's the only thing I have to answer for is me." God says, "No, you don't.
[time=3402] You have a responsibility to the watching world, and particularly to watching Christians who may not be as mature and as strong as you are, to be living a life so that if they copy you, they're on good ground."
[time=3419] I was having a very friendly conversation with a young man who just couldn't understand this principle.
[time=3425] He kept saying, "Well, I just have to please God. I don't have to please anyone else." That's not true.
[time=3431] The passage is saying here, "We have a responsibility how we live our life to make sure it's exemplary so that no one else will ever be misled by what we're doing."
[time=3445] Because they may not be as strong as we are.
[time=3451] So the great principle is this.
[time=3454] It's as though he has stretched a board across a fulcrum, and on one side rests what we know.
[time=3463] But that keeps us out of bounds, on the other side must be put love.
[time=3469] Way back in verse 1, he said, "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
[time=3477] And we have a responsibility to do the things that are going to build up one another.
[time=3481] Why? Because Christ loved everybody so much that he died for them, and why should we cause someone to stumble and miss God's love when he loved him enough to die?
[time=3492] God loves you, and he died on the cross for you. Don't ever be a stumbling block to someone else believing.

[time=3514] Making a decision for Jesus Christ can be a very important step.
[time=3518] If you've made that decision this morning, I'd like to take a moment and just pray with you.
[time=3522] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3525] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this hour, and I thank you for the privilege to know Jesus Christ as a personal Savior.
[time=3533] To understand that I can ask you to come into my heart, I ask you to do that today.
