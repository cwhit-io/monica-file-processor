[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=83] We pray that you'll open up our hearts and minds of understanding that we may be able to receive that which you have for us.
[time=90] As the music is sung, as a song, as a word that goes forth from our pastor's lips, we pray that the Holy Spirit may logic to accomplish that special purpose you have for us.
[time=101] You brought us here for a purpose, Lord, and we pray that we may fulfill that purpose, so we may not only be hearers of the word, but doers of the word also, and apply what we hear to our very lives.
[time=112] So bless this hour and use it in the heart of each one here, those who are not in the salvation.
[time=119] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=121] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from the sanctuary choir, special groups and soloists, and the message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=137] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=141] So speak to each one of us from your Word today, and use your Word to glorify your Son in each one of our lives, and we'll thank you for it in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=171] [MUSIC]
[time=201] Thank you. Please be seated.
[time=217] Good morning, and welcome to our second worship service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=226] The Bible says in Hebrews that we are not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together, but we are indeed to meet and to worship today and we're glad that each of you are here.
[time=238] Our auditorium is full to overflowing, which leads me to say I would like to invite many of you to join us for the 930 worship service where we have a few more seats, but it's certainly great to see you here this morning and to worship together.
[time=252] We're looking forward to the days ahead as we continue to share Christ in new people, come to know Him and come to worship with us.
[time=260] We're delighted that you are here.
[time=262] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us today for the Bible hour.
[time=266] This past week, we've had the privilege of meeting many people who aren't able to come to church for one reason or another, and this has become their opportunity to worship.
[time=276] Thank you for worshiping with us. This morning, our choir is going to sing "Alleluia," a song of praise.
[time=283] They're directed by Mr. Rick Halls, who is helping us so ably as while Pete Coby is gone.
[time=306] Jesus Christ, our King of Glory now is risen from the dead.
[time=336] Oh my sins have been forgiven, God is merciful to me.
[time=346] Faith has framed us, save us promise, praise them hard and full and free.
[time=354] Oh my soul be ever praising.
[time=358] For the great, redeemers now, joyous sons still hear me raising one to God in heaven above.
[time=370] For your count is closed forever, Jesus Christ has made it all.
[time=378] It is my life dear to the perfect of my soul, save my soul.
[time=385] Here is the no condemnation, I am fully reconciled.
[time=393] What a wonderful salvation for our sinners shall be found.
[time=400] Alleluia, alleluia, our two men and boys is raised.
[time=408] Sing to God of Him, and this sing to God of Him of praise.
[time=416] He who on the cross has saved your Lord.
[time=420] For the world's salvation, men, Jesus Christ, our King of Glory now is risen from the dead.
[time=429] Let's continue in our singing by turning to Him number 18.
[time=447] Him number 18 all hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=451] This sing stands as one, two and four.
[time=481] Heaven can come in, O Lord of all.
[time=488] Bring forth the joy of God, Heaven and God in, O Lord of all.
[time=501] Reach out and sing of Israel's free team and some from God of all.
[time=510] Hail Him, who says to God is risen from God in, O Lord of all.
[time=530] And with thunder, sing from me as his name may fall.
[time=543] We'll join the everlasting sun and come in, O Lord of all.
[time=569] Thank you for your fine singing. Listen now to the ministry of our Handbell Choir under the direction of Mr. Rich Lady Kate.
[time=599] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=692] Normally Pete and I are sitting here waiting to have a brief chat with you about some things that relate to the Bible hour.
[time=700] But today I'm by myself. Pete is off on a trip and will be gone for the next two Sundays and we will certainly miss him.
[time=708] We have a ministry here called Super 60s that Pastor George Lantman heads up. It's a tremendous outreach to the senior adults of the Fort Wayne community.
[time=718] From time to time they plan special trips. They've been to Israel, they've been to the world's fair, they've been to Florida and now they're on their second trip to Hawaii.
[time=727] Pastor Lantman had hoped to lead that trip but Pete is taking his place because Pastor Lantman's wife Mary is very critically ill with cancer.
[time=735] And I would like to take just this moment to encourage you to be praying for George and Mary Lantman.
[time=742] Each Sunday morning the people who come forward here, Pastor Lantman counsels them or oversees the counseling.
[time=749] He makes thousands of hospital calls each year and leads us in Super 60s, heads up to the Department of Pastoral Care here at Blackhawk.
[time=757] He's a brother and we love him and we love his wife Mary and these are very critical times for them.
[time=763] And we would ask you to pray particularly for George and Mary Lantman and Mary's two sisters, Elizabeth and Kay are here helping around the house and taking care of Mary.
[time=775] They've come from Pennsylvania and we love them in the Lord and are praying for them and want to encourage you to do the same.
[time=782] So Pete is gone and he'll be gone today in the next Sunday and then Lord willing I'll be gone the next two Sundays on a missions trip to the Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong.
[time=792] So I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss my friend Pete.
[time=795] We've looked at the calendar and we'll probably be in Fort Wayne about one hour overlap between our trips.
[time=801] But today we have this time together for me to encourage you to write for an excellent little booklet entitled Singleness.
[time=809] I've told you before who my favorite author is and that is Charles Swindall, pastor of the Fullerton Evangelical Free Church in California and the teacher on the daily ministry of radio called Insight for Living.
[time=823] Pastor Swindall is one of the finest Bible teachers I know.
[time=828] Amongst other things I would have to rate him as one of the most thoroughly biblical and practical teachers at the same time.
[time=836] His booklet is entitled Singleness and it opens up our eyes to the teachings of God's Word primarily in 1st Corinthians 7 which we've studied recently about the great value of being single.
[time=850] Many of us sense a great deal of pressure in our society to do what most people do and that is graduate from high school, consider college, get married, have children, buy a car, buy a house and on the cycle of life goes.
[time=864] And that is certainly a fine pattern.
[time=867] But yet there may be a plan for your life that God has that by being single you might be a more strategic advantage to him.
[time=876] I mention a missions trip that I'll be going on Lord willing in the month of March.
[time=881] There will be visiting two single women who because of their singleness are uniquely able to go to the field and to serve because they are single for the gospel sake.
[time=892] Well this pamphlet shows us what God has to say.
[time=896] Our society talks a great deal about being single but that singleness is often elevated because we're so selfish.
[time=904] We say we'll be single then you don't have to worry about your husband or your wife or your children.
[time=908] All that you have you can spend on yourself.
[time=910] Well that's not certainly the biblical encouragement to be single.
[time=914] The biblical encouragement to be single is that God may have called you into that position to make you exclusively free to serve him.
[time=923] It's an exciting book even for someone like myself who is married because it gives me new insights into God's plan for lives of other people.
[time=932] Write to us today and we will be glad to send you a copy. Simply write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=947] Allow me to repeat that one more time. The Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=958] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour and if you don't have your Bible in your hand may I encourage you right now to go get it so that we can study God's Word together from 1 Corinthians in the 9th chapter.
[time=988] Just keep me near the cross. There a precious fountain.
[time=1005] Three to one, our healing stream, blood from every fountain.
[time=1024] In the cross, in the cross, in my glory and blood.
[time=1043] In my language and soul, shall my grace be on the river.
[time=1062] In the cross, oh, well of God, bring it safe before me.
[time=1080] Well be well from day to day.
[time=1091] In the cross, in my glory and blood.
[time=1119] Till my raptured soul shall find rest be on the river.
[time=1149] Let's be on the river, let the cross, Jesus keep me near the cross.
[time=1178] Jesus, we would pray this morning that you would keep us near the cross of Christ, that place of not only his dying but our surrender.
[time=1199] God keep us near the cross, we pray that for those of us and our youth that you would keep us near the cross, that in the world that pressures us and squeezes us into its mold of materialism and possessions that you would keep us near the cross.
[time=1222] God keep us from being possessed by the things that we own, our desire to own, keep us near the cross.
[time=1232] God help us to be pure as young men and women.
[time=1237] In the world that says your body is your toy, use it, enjoy without regard to marriage or commitment.
[time=1248] God keep us near the cross that we might be pure.
[time=1253] God keep those of us in the middle of life near the cross as the pressures of our community and our job and our family squeeze us.
[time=1267] God help us to be near the cross and teach us to order our private world so that we're not driven men and women but we're men and women who are called.
[time=1278] God keep us near the cross, those of us in our senior years.
[time=1284] Retirement's been earned and rest from our job is merited.
[time=1289] But God never allow us to retire from worship and service of you.
[time=1294] Help us to seize these golden years as golden days of opportunity for Christ.
[time=1300] Keep us near the cross.
[time=1303] God we pray particularly that you would keep your hand on those who are suffering and draw them near the cross.
[time=1312] We pray for Connie Goodwin and her family as she faces cancer that her surgery would be effective, that you would give her freedom from fear and health.
[time=1325] We pray for Richard Hershey, that your hand would be upon his body and you would give him health and life.
[time=1332] We pray for those who are battling cancer such as Mary and Hazel.
[time=1341] And for Ralph Kramer and others who face chronic illness, we pray today for those who've lost loved ones, particularly for the family of Dorothy King.
[time=1355] God today, draw each of us near the cross.
[time=1360] But perhaps most of all those who have never known Christ personally, draw them near to your cross,
[time=1370] help them today to see that you love them.
[time=1373] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1400] When the valley is deep, when the mountain is steep, when the body is weary, when we stumble and fall.
[time=1428] When the choices are hard, when we're battered and scarred, when we've sped our resources.
[time=1447] When we've given our own, in Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=1465] In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=1476] Dear Lord, with the prize, clear before our eyes, we find the strength to press on.
[time=1502] In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=1526] Dear Lord, with the prize, clear before our eyes, we find the strength to press on.
[time=1553] In Jesus' name, we find the strength to press on.
[time=1580] Some this week are facing disappointment at a deep level.
[time=1589] Plans and dreams that you've had, expectations and hopes have fallen apart.
[time=1598] Some of you, in recent days, have gone through a time of financial reverse that you never anticipated.
[time=1609] Press on.
[time=1612] Some of you have lost loved ones, and you never anticipated the depth of pain that you experience now.
[time=1621] Press on. Some of you are facing disappointment and heartbreak because of the lifestyle of your children.
[time=1634] Press on.
[time=1637] Some of you face the fear of rejection, perhaps even divorce. Some of you have already been through that grim valley.
[time=1649] Press on.
[time=1653] Some of you are feeling the sting of rejection in your high school, at your university, because you don't conform to the image.
[time=1668] Press on.
[time=1671] There's any lesson in life that has served me well has been the one that, in a different way, says "press on," the simple phrase, "it's too soon to quit."
[time=1683] I don't know all that each of you have been through this week, but God says, "press on."
[time=1689] It's too soon to quit.
[time=1691] Open your Bibles with us for a time of study this morning to 1 Corinthians 9.
[time=1698] All of God's Word, but this book, particularly, is so relevant and so fresh.
[time=1704] I remember hearing my favorite Bible teacher, Charles Swindall, ask his congregation to open their Bibles to the 7th chapter of the book of First Californians.
[time=1714] This is fresh stuff, relevant, talks about life, not much has changed.
[time=1721] God's Word speaks with a freshness about so many issues.
[time=1727] And in this particular part of our study, we're looking at issues of personal rights and liberties.
[time=1735] And so I would like to call our study this morning, pardon me, but I think you're stepping on my rights.
[time=1743] All of us feel like we have certain rights and privileges.
[time=1746] There are.
[time=1748] And I, for one, don't enjoy it when somebody comes and puts their foot right on my liberty and says, "you can't do that."
[time=1755] See, the Bible says these things over here are clearly wrong.
[time=1759] Don't ever do that.
[time=1761] The Bible says these things over here and they're clearly right.
[time=1764] Always do these.
[time=1766] And then there's this nebulous ground in the middle.
[time=1770] How do you address some of those issues?
[time=1772] What principles guide us?
[time=1775] The numbers of issues are numerous.
[time=1777] I can't avoid passing one up because of its recent occurrence here at Blackhawk.
[time=1783] What about dancing?
[time=1785] Someone says why the Bible speaks so clearly about licentiousness and licentiousness
[time=1791] and wantoness and debauchery and degradation.
[time=1794] And I don't think anything represents it more than secular dancing.
[time=1797] It is clearly wrong.
[time=1799] Someone said, "Som such and such, David danced."
[time=1805] Well, why that is so important is just a week ago Friday, we had a near-blizzard situation
[time=1811] and all the schools around the community were closed, including ours.
[time=1815] Scott Schindler, who plays the organ, said he was pushing all the different buttons on his way to the college and he heard the announcement that Blackhawk Christian school was closed today and then this late word from Blackhawk.
[time=1827] The senior citizens dance scheduled for Friday morning has also been canceled.
[time=1831] I really didn't think it was necessary to call George.
[time=1836] I was pretty confident that we didn't have a dance planned for that Friday morning.
[time=1840] So if you heard that report and were scratching your head, please know that that was a miscommunication somewhere along the way.
[time=1848] What about dancing?
[time=1850] Well, that's a tough issue, isn't it?
[time=1853] Right now in Fort Wayne, there are new places of entertainment opening up for teenagers.
[time=1858] Dance places, places that have excellent security, no alcohol is allowed, no smoking is allowed.
[time=1865] Last night, Kathy and I were out to dinner with our friend Steve and Renee Longbrake. Steve is the administrator of our school.
[time=1872] We drove by one of these spots.
[time=1874] We said, "I wonder what those are like. I wonder if, you know, what we're hearing is really true." And Steve just doesn't pass up an opportunity. He says, "Do you want to find out?" So we turned around and we went back. You should have seen the site.
[time=1886] Nobody was over 18, let alone 30.
[time=1889] All four of us unplanned had on long, dark coats.
[time=1898] And as we walked in, the crowd parted like Moses before the Red Sea.
[time=1906] Quickly, the attendant said, "I'll get security just a moment." This gentleman comes out with a uniform and they escorted us in and said, "You know, we have 15 undercover policemen here.
[time=1916] We're making sure nothing happens and isn't this a fantastic place?" We said, "Thank you for letting us see." And we left on.
[time=1923] First Corinthians chapter 9, how do you deal with these doubtfuls?
[time=1927] They're just dying for me to say something more.
[time=1930] First Corinthians chapter 9.
[time=1935] Paul writes, "Am I not an apostle?
[time=1939] Am I not free?
[time=1942] Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?
[time=1946] Are not ye my work in the Lord?
[time=1951] If I be not in an apostle to others, yet doubtlessly I am to you,
[time=1958] for the seal of my apostleship are ye in the Lord?" Mine answer to them that do examine me is this.
[time=1968] Have we no right to eat and to drink?
[time=1974] Have we no right to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles,
[time=1980] and as the brother of the Lord and Cephas, or I only and Barnabas?
[time=1990] Have we no right to forbear working?
[time=1995] Have we no earth to war at any time at his own expense?
[time=1999] Who planeth a vineyard and eateth not of its fruit?
[time=2002] Or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
[time=2007] Say I these things as a man, or sayeth not the law of the same also.
[time=2013] For it is written in the law of Moses, thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox
[time=2019] that treadeth out the grain.
[time=2021] That God take care of the oxen, or sayeth ye yet altogether for our sakes.
[time=2028] For our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope,
[time=2035] and he that thrasheth in hope should be a partaker of this hope.
[time=2041] If we have sown unto you spiritual things, it is a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things.
[time=2049] If others be partakers of this right over you, are not we rather?
[time=2055] Nevertheless, we have not used this right, but bear all things lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
[time=2063] Do ye not know that they who minister about holy things live of the things of the temple,
[time=2069] and they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
[time=2073] Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach of the gospel should live of the gospel.
[time=2079] But I have used none of these things.
[time=2083] Neither have I written these things that it should be so done unto me.
[time=2089] For it is better for me to die than any man should make my glory void.
[time=2097] In chapter 9 Paul is giving some personal illustrations of the previous principle that he taught in chapter 8.
[time=2105] In chapter 8 in verses 9 and 13 he teaches the principle that none of us should exercise our personal rights
[time=2114] in a way that hinders the growth of another person.
[time=2120] Whatever my rights may be, I should never exercise those so that it's going to mislead you or misrepresent Christ.
[time=2129] We're to give up the liberties if there's a danger of those things happening.
[time=2134] Now Paul gives an illustration and he begins with rhetorical questions.
[time=2138] He said, am I not an apostle?
[time=2140] And how he's going to argue is because he's an apostle he has certain rights.
[time=2145] Look at verse 4, have we no right?
[time=2154] Look at verse 6, or I only in Barnabas have we no right?
[time=2159] I'm getting the impression that Paul feels that he has some rights there.
[time=2164] So he begins, I am an apostle and because I'm an apostle I've got rights.
[time=2170] It's his second question, am I not free? Don't I have liberty in Christ?
[time=2175] I mean if you've got liberty in Christ Paul says why don't I get some liberty in Christ around here?
[time=2180] Then he begins to justify our least substantiate his claim to be an apostle.
[time=2186] He says I'm a thenic, have an icing Christ and the answer of course is yes.
[time=2191] That's the authentic sign of an apostle.
[time=2194] In Acts chapter 2 verse 20 or 32 and Acts chapter 1 and Acts chapter 13, repeatedly it says the sign of an apostle was someone who saw Christ.
[time=2206] We know that Christ particularly appeared to Saul before he was called Paul on the road to Damascus.
[time=2216] Paul had seen him, he said I'm a thenic.
[time=2220] You're saying well that's great for Paul but what about me?
[time=2224] I'm never going to see Christ.
[time=2226] If I said I did you wouldn't believe me, you're right.
[time=2230] But you remember what Jesus said to Thomas?
[time=2232] Tended the disciples are there and Jesus appears after he's dead, he is resurrected and he appears to ten of them.
[time=2239] Thomas is out running errands.
[time=2242] He comes back and they say Thomas, you're not going to believe this man, but listen to this.
[time=2248] We just saw Jesus in the flesh and Thomas said you're right.
[time=2253] I'm not going to believe this until I touch him and I want to touch specific identifying marks.
[time=2261] Jesus appeared.
[time=2264] Thomas said my Lord and my God.
[time=2268] And remember this statement of Jesus.
[time=2271] He said Thomas you believe because you have seen but I tell you blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.
[time=2281] Oh I wish that Christ appeared that would be so convincing but yet more people probably would not believe because they didn't believe then and it's doubtful they would now.
[time=2291] But by faith we can see Christ.
[time=2294] By faith we can sense that he's real. Hebrew says that faith is the evidence of things hoped for the substance of things not seen.
[time=2305] We can know Christ today.
[time=2307] More than anything else that's the important message every Sunday.
[time=2312] You can know Christ personally.
[time=2314] Oh I can't show him to you in the flesh but I can show him to you in the lives of hundreds of people who are here.
[time=2319] He is alive and he lives within our hearts. I hope that you know him.
[time=2324] Paul said I know him. I've seen him.
[time=2328] Then he goes on to say I'm not only authentic. I've been effective.
[time=2332] He says if there are people out there who doubt I'm an apostle that's one thing but if anybody should know that I'm an apostle you friends in Corinth should be the ones to say.
[time=2341] Well Paul's an apostle and the reason we know that is because of the message that he gave that changed our lives in Christ.
[time=2349] As a matter of fact he says you are the seal of my apostleship.
[time=2353] A seal was usually a wax seal that was melded poured on to something and then stamped.
[time=2361] Fruit was packaged in a sack of sorts. It was tied off and wax was poured over it and the manufacture so to speak.
[time=2370] Sealed it and then as it was shipped somewhere else that was proof that that commodity indeed did originate where the merchants told you it came from.
[time=2379] It was proof. It's kind of like the cereal boxes.
[time=2382] You know they have these little proof of purchase seals so you can send away for your hot air balloon ride or whatever the latest advertisement is.
[time=2389] Paul said I've got proof.
[time=2392] In this day Roman law said for you to have a will it had to be sealed with seven different seals for your will to stand.
[time=2401] Paul said you are my seal that I am authentic because I've been effective in your life.
[time=2408] Now he said because I am an apostle I have certain rights and he names two of them.
[time=2413] The first right he says that I have is the right to eat and drink. I think what he's saying there is I have the right to a livelihood for the labor that I'm producing and as a apostle.
[time=2425] He says I'm out with Barnabas we're serving as an apostle and we have the right to collect an income so that we can live to eat and drink to have a livelihood.
[time=2435] That's right number one and in verse four he mentions that and then in verse six he says this or I only in Barnabas have we no right to forbear working.
[time=2445] What he's saying is we're over here working in the ministry but now we turn and spend eight hours a day over here making tents so that we don't have to take any money out of the ministry to live on.
[time=2458] He said why does it that we have to make tents can't we forbear this secondary job and he reasons everybody else does why shouldn't we.
[time=2468] And then the second right he said is don't we have the right to have a wife.
[time=2473] Now he says a sister that means a believer believers are always commanded in scripture to only marry another believer.
[time=2482] Never should a believer engage themselves to an unbeliever but Paul says can I find a believer who and have a wife and go on my trips and take a wife with me.
[time=2495] He said what the brothers of the Lord do by that he meant Jude and James the half brothers of Christ the natural born children of Joseph and Mary.
[time=2504] He said they've got wives and see for us Peter he's got a wife we've got rights here.
[time=2513] So Paul says this I'm an apostle and as an apostle I have certain rights and this one about collecting an income from the ministry he goes on to defend.
[time=2525] He gives five illustrations why he should be getting paid for the ministry illustration number one is found in verse seven and I'll call that natural human experience.
[time=2536] He talks about a soldier he said a soldier never goes to war at his own expense.
[time=2544] In 1971 I received a letter from our mutual uncle uncle Sam began greetings you have been selected and I was drafted to go in the military service fortunately I didn't have to supply my own equipment.
[time=2560] Now someone said that if you had to supply your own equipment no one would ever be a responsible soldier.
[time=2567] Someone else said in the military if you lose any of your equipment you have to pay for it and that's why captains go down with the ship and they can't afford to serve.
[time=2578] Paul's using that same reasoning if you're going to get drafted into the war at least the military pays your expenses.
[time=2586] Paul said I've been drafted by Christ not against my will but Christ called me into this ministry and it's only reasonable the ministry should pay for the expenses.
[time=2596] Then he gives the example of a man who works in a vineyard.
[time=2601] Maybe another man owns this large acreage of figs and dates and grapes and of citrus fruit.
[time=2610] He said anybody who goes out and works in the vineyard is free while they're picking the grapes to eat a few.
[time=2616] Remember my sister when I was in junior high school she was in high school she got a job working at an ice cream store in the local mall.
[time=2624] And she came home and said you would love this job because you can have all the ice cream you want with no one's around.
[time=2630] I thought man that's the greatest job in the world.
[time=2634] She said but after two weeks you only want to see ice cream.
[time=2638] And Paul's saying these guys are out there they're harvesting the vineyard and they're allowed to take a little of it.
[time=2644] Nobody stops him from that.
[time=2646] He said when a shepherd's out maybe miles away from the city and he's grazing the sheep so that they can eat.
[time=2653] He's allowed to take the milk from the sheep and drink it or deter it into other dairy products.
[time=2659] Paul says normal human experience teaches that the workman deserves to be paid.
[time=2666] But then he gives a second proof for his argument and that's the Old Testament law.
[time=2671] In verses 8, 9 and 10 he says Deuteronomy 25 verse 4 is being quoted.
[time=2679] That an auction is not to be muzzled why he is crushing the grain.
[time=2684] I am a city slicker.
[time=2686] So if this is not actually exact please forbear.
[time=2691] But basically you've got this huge stone.
[time=2694] On top of it is another stone that is turned.
[time=2698] The grain is put there and as the one on top turns it crushes the grain.
[time=2702] To turn that big stone you have a big pole that gives you leverage.
[time=2706] And at the end of a pole you have an ox who pushes it and it turns and as some of the grain is crushed it falls on the ground.
[time=2713] And the ox is allowed to bend down and eat it.
[time=2716] And God says don't muzzle the auction while he's crushing the grain.
[time=2723] Paul says do you think God really stuck that verse in the Bible for the sake of the oxen?
[time=2728] He said of course not.
[time=2729] He put that in to teach us to pay those who labor in the ministry.
[time=2734] And then he gives a third reason.
[time=2737] Verse 12 he says if others be a partaker of this right over you are not we rather.
[time=2743] He says other people come in and minister to you and you pay them for their ministry.
[time=2747] He's saying well certainly you ought to be doing it the Barnabas and I you wouldn't even exist in Christ if it wasn't for the two of us.
[time=2752] And then fourthly he says the example of the temple priest.
[time=2757] Probably Paul has here in mind the Jewish temple but even in the secular temples when an animal would be brought and it would be sacrificed it wasn't all burn up.
[time=2767] A major portion of that was then given to the priest from which they would first eat and then secondly sell the surplus and make a profit.
[time=2777] And then finally he says the Lord taught this as well.
[time=2782] Verse 14 even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
[time=2789] No doubt he's referencing back to Matthew 10 10 where Jesus sent out his disciples and he said the workman is worthy of his hire.
[time=2798] Now in all of that Paul has told us two things so far one is an apostle with rights and two he has documented his right to an income.
[time=2810] Now Paul was not making appeal before a church finance committee at budget increase time that wasn't his point at all.
[time=2818] His point is found in verse 12 he said if others be partakers of this right over you are we not rather.
[time=2828] Now notice this nevertheless we have not used this right but bear all things lest the gospel of Christ should be hindered.
[time=2839] What Paul was saying here is of course we have all these rights and he's saying I'm voluntarily choosing to make tents not collecting an income from you so that the gospel will not be hindered.
[time=2852] For you see in those days just as today there are those who are quote in the religion business because there's money in it.
[time=2861] Two examples out of the New Testament come to mind. First there was Demetrius of Ephesus a man who thoroughly loved the patron goddess of Ephesus the great Diana.
[time=2873] However most of his devotion was because he was a silversmith made these little silver statues of Diana and made a whole lot of money.
[time=2881] And along came the apostle Paul preaching Christ literally hundreds of people got saved and business fell off that quarter for Demetrius and he was tight.
[time=2892] He didn't like that. There was money to be had in his religion and then there's a man in Acts by the name of Simon Magnus who seemed to have some occultic type powers.
[time=2904] And he was making a great deal of money exercising these occultic type gifts and along comes Peter with much more power and Simon says to the apostle Peter.
[time=2916] Now listen how much do you want for one of those gifts you've got because I know I could make a killing on this racket.
[time=2924] They rent it for the money and Paul said I'm never going to allow it to be thought I'm ministering because I'm in it for the money.
[time=2935] He said I'll give up every claim and every right to financial support so that nothing will hinder the gospel.
[time=2943] You know how pastors use their money is always going to be under the spotlight of the world.
[time=2951] And we need to be so careful as Christian that we're using discretion.
[time=2957] I don't believe that someone who is a Christian worker needs to be paid poorly but I don't think they should ever live extravagantly because it's going to hinder the gospel.
[time=2966] Money is always suspect and churches are always going to be scrutinized for how they use it.
[time=2972] Maybe you've heard the story about these three little boys who were bragging about whose daddy made the most money.
[time=2978] One little boy said well my dad's a doctor and somebody comes in he talks to him for ten minutes and charges him thirty five dollars.
[time=2985] Oh boy that's nothing.
[time=2987] My dad's a lawyer and some guy called last night talked for two minutes he wrote him a bill for fifty dollars.
[time=2993] Another little boy said that's nothing my dad's a pastor he gets up and talks for twenty minutes and it takes ten guys to carry the money out of that place.
[time=3001] We're always going to be on that front edge when it comes to talking about money.
[time=3009] And Paul said I'm going to give up the right to this and then I love what he says in verse fifteen.
[time=3016] He says but I have used none of these things meaning his rights.
[time=3021] I've used none of these things neither have I written to you today so that it should be done unto me.
[time=3031] Paul wasn't trying to backdoor the Corinthians.
[time=3034] He wasn't saying all this so somebody would catch the hint and say well maybe we ought to be paying Paul and Barnabas a little something.
[time=3041] He said don't misunderstood I'm not saying this now so all of a sudden you'll start passing in the money not at all.
[time=3051] Paul was saying I have freedom to collect an income and I have the freedom to give up that right if it's going to be the advantage of the gospel.
[time=3062] And Paul says I choose to do that.
[time=3065] Let me draw out of this a number of applications that I think are relevant for our church and each of us as an individual.
[time=3074] First of all I think all that Paul is saying here about finances tells us that the ministry costs money and that we should expect it.
[time=3086] Now I'm not trying to backdoor you there was a day when churches paid in chickens and tomatoes.
[time=3095] I'm thankful those days are gone by because I'm not particularly fond of either one.
[time=3100] Our church pays a very good salary to me but it's just a fresh reminder that the ministry costs money.
[time=3109] And I don't think we never need to feel guilty if we say to our school to our television ministry to our congregation beloved this place takes money.
[time=3120] You know it's so hard to give money to intangibles isn't it?
[time=3125] If you run out to some oops all these sale and you buy a new color television boy you see that thing you hear it you touch it.
[time=3133] It's there you say this is what we got for our money.
[time=3136] It's so tangible you go down in the bank you arrange financing you buy a house it's tangible it's there.
[time=3142] You can paint it you can paper it you can carpet it you can roof it you can weed it you can cut the grass I mean that's pretty tangible stuff.
[time=3151] But the ministry so intangible isn't it?
[time=3155] How much is it worth to be encouraged by a Sunday school class?
[time=3161] That's pretty intangible how much is it worth to have your children taught in a quality Sunday school classroom?
[time=3170] How much is it worth to have somebody watching your children in the nursery while you're here a lot that one we can measure?
[time=3178] But the ministry is basically so intangible but Paul saying here it is cost money and he said it's only reasonable that we pay for ministry.
[time=3189] That's what all these verses 7 through 15 are saying ministry cost and that's why we don't need to apologize to say to you we need to increase our budget.
[time=3199] This past year we looked at our school teachers and said we're not doing right by them and the largest single increase was to our school teachers.
[time=3206] Second largest increase to our missionaries because those are the people who we say they're working for the Lord and we're not doing enough.
[time=3213] When we look at missions in particular we need to change our mentality.
[time=3219] The mentality has been how much money is it gonna take to get brothers so-and-so to Africa? You sure we can't do it any cheaper than that?
[time=3229] We need to be saying what's the most we can do to make that ministry the most effective it can be?
[time=3236] The missions committee and board has planned a trip for Kathy and I to go on a tour of three of the mission stations to see missionaries from this church and to come back and do report.
[time=3246] We're looking forward to that and I'm glad they said what's the most we can do because some of them were talking about a one-way ticket.
[time=3252] Now we need to be generous folks and you don't want to shortchange these things.
[time=3258] What's he saying the ministry cost money if a missionary comes we have the privilege of supporting them and sending them it costs money to get the word around the world.
[time=3272] It costs money to get it across the street. It costs money to broadcast.
[time=3277] It costs money. Don't ever apologize for your giving or for your role in asking others to give.
[time=3286] Another application. Not so much to us as a church but to us as individuals.
[time=3292] I think this is saying that service often demands a sacrifice. Serving Christ will often demand of you a sacrifice.
[time=3302] Paul said I've got some rights but if what it takes is giving up these rights there they go forget him.
[time=3310] He said yeah there's sacrifice but as I read Paul I read a tone here that says there's sacrifice but the satisfaction is greater.
[time=3320] I saw a 20-minute slide presentation of Grace Brethren missionaries in Europe and the struggles are there and these missionaries put together this slide presentation and showed all the hardships but the bottom line was this but the joy is greater.
[time=3336] Everything they had given up by way of privilege and rights after it was all said and done they said but the joy was greater.
[time=3345] There's sacrifice and serving Christ but the joy will always be greater if you walk with him.
[time=3355] But here is the most important application of all this. What Paul was saying is this you've got rights you've got rights you've got rights but be willing to give up your rights if it in any way is going to help with the advance of the gospel.
[time=3380] You feel like you've got rights to go to a certain place that's fine but just make sure you're willing to give it up if it needs to be.
[time=3390] You see don't ever let something that you own own you. Don't ever let your rights become a new form of bondage that says I've got to have my rights and I've got to exercise them.
[time=3405] To put it in a phrase let me challenge you with this. Don't ever let your rights become a wrong. Don't ever let your rights become a wrong.
[time=3419] What is it that is so precious to you that you're going to keep that knowing that it's going to hinder someone else in their spiritual walk.
[time=3431] That's when your rights become a wrong. Paul said I'll give up my livelihood and my privileges of partnership with a wife to advance the gospel.
[time=3446] Well that's sacrifice but the satisfaction is greater. Remember this one paradoxical statement of Christ who's whoever will keep his life will lose it and who's whoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospel that one will find it.
[time=3468] You'll not find life fuller or greater than you will in knowing Christ personally.
