[time=90] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] [bell] It's hard to reach one of our lives to accomplish a special purpose you have.
[time=112] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=114] And now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=129] Join us won't you for the Bible hour.
[time=132] Oh, the birds I am to bring, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, and the love the universe is made.
[time=150] And since I so, I say without you, I'll bring no more, I'll bring no more.
[time=179] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=247] Thank you. Please be seated.
[time=251] It is a joy to welcome you this morning to our morning worship service.
[time=259] The Old Testament, as David would write of his love for the Lord, he said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go unto the house of the Lord."
[time=270] The Bible continually refers to our gathering together as a time of great joy of celebration and of worship.
[time=278] Over the years, somehow, church has become somewhat of a sober, stoic, somber experience. Most of us as men purposely tie our ties too tight on Sunday morning,
[time=290] so we can get this strained look on our face.
[time=293] But the Bible says that we're to greet each other, that we're to love each other, we're to express our hearts with joy.
[time=300] So if you would like to break Western tradition and enjoy this hour, we want to invite you to do it. Not only those of you who are here, but our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=311] We don't want to make light of difficult circumstances in life, but simply to say, in the midst of even the storms, God can give peace, and He can give joy.
[time=321] We hope you have it, and we hope you're able to wear it today.
[time=324] Why would we have joy? Because we've come to worship our God.
[time=328] Who is a great God? Great is the Lord.
[time=331] He is worthy of honor. Great is the Lord.
[time=335] He is worthy of praise.
[time=365] Great is the Lord, and worthy of coming.
[time=369] Great is the Lord, and worthy of grace. Great is the Lord.
[time=375] There will be lots of words to call and sing praise.
[time=383] Praise the Lord.
[time=395] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. He is holy and trust.
[time=401] He trust in His love. Praise the great is the Lord.
[time=407] He is faithful by His mercy. He proves His love.
[time=413] He is the Lord, and worthy of coming. Great is the Lord,
[time=419] and worthy of grace. Great is the Lord.
[time=424] There will be lots of words to call and sing praise.
[time=432] He is the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[time=443] Great are you Lord and worthy of coming. Great are you Lord and worthy of praise.
[time=452] Great are you Lord, by yourself my voice. I lift up my voice.
[time=458] Great are you Lord.
[time=466] Great are you Lord and worthy of coming. Great are you Lord.
[time=474] Great are you Lord. Great are you Lord. Great are you Lord.
[time=491] Let's continue with our singing by turning to him number 68.
[time=500] Hymn number 68. Praise him, praise him. Jesus our blessed redeemer.
[time=520] Sing over his wonderful love from way. Hail him, hail him.
[time=528] Why is there angels in glory? Send them over into his holy name.
[time=538] By the shampoo, Jesus of God is children, in his arms he carries him all in love.
[time=550] Praise him, praise him. Tell his excellent greatness. Praise him, praise him.
[time=559] Remembering joy for soul. Praise him, praise him. Jesus our blessed redeemer.
[time=570] Hymn, praise him, praise him. Praise him, praise him, praise him.
[time=590] Praise him, praise him, Jesus of our shadows. Come on, come again, wonderful demons come.
[time=601] Praise him, praise him. Tell his excellent greatness. Praise him, praise him.
[time=611] Tell him, praise him, praise him. Jesus our blessed redeemer.
[time=624] Praise him, praise him. Praise him, praise him. Praise him, praise him.
[time=641] Praise him, praise him. Praise him, praise him.
[time=669] Thank you for that fine singing.
[time=674] Marilyn Wong comes now to minister in music. The song she's singing is "I Will Praise Him".
[time=682] I will praise him. I will always praise him.
[time=697] When I think about my life on earth and why I serve the king, I just have to share my thoughts with you and let you know just why I sing.
[time=712] You see he reached right down and changed my life. He cared so much for me, so I'll lift my voice and praise to him.
[time=724] Thank you Lord for Calvary. I will praise him as long as I live. I'll serve him and I'll love him.
[time=742] I'll give all I have to give and I'll lift up my heart and voice and praise him till I die.
[time=753] Then I'll still be singing this song to him when I meet him in the sky.
[time=766] Well my life is so much different now since I found the source of love. Now it's not an earthly source my friend, but it's the Savior from above.
[time=781] Now you can have this life unlimited, abundant, full and free. Jesus said he came to give us life, a life of joy and victory.
[time=800] I will praise him as long as I live. I'll serve him and I'll love him. I'll give all I have to give and I'll lift up my heart and voice and praise him till I die.
[time=826] I'll still be singing this song to him when I meet him in the sky. And I'll still be singing this song to him when I meet him in the sky.
[time=851] I will always praise him.
[time=864] You have probably noticed today that Pete Coby is not here with us. Today he's en route back from Hawaii where he's been leading a trip of senior citizens.
[time=875] We certainly miss Pete and hope that he had a great week, that it was along with a week of work and administration, a time of great fun for both Pete and Carol. We certainly miss him and look forward to him being back with us next Sunday.
[time=889] But today with me is one of my close friends, Steve Longbrake, who's also the administrator of our school, Black Hawk Christian School. Good morning Steve.
[time=897] Morning Rick. These are exciting days for you not only as the administrator of our school, but you're also the basketball coach in today's a special day.
[time=904] That's right. Today our sectional draw occurs. We'll find out who we're going to be playing in next week's tournament.
[time=910] Am I going to start what I want to know?
[time=912] You won't start, but you'll play a significant role.
[time=914] Okay, that sounds fair. I've asked Steve to join us today so that you might know some of the things about Black Hawk Christian School. Our school here is something that Kathy and I are so thankful for.
[time=926] Our oldest daughter Rachel is a Kindergartener. We'll be a first grader next year and Rebecca will be a Kindergartener, so good luck next year.
[time=935] Thanks a lot. I think we'll need the luck.
[time=937] Well your daughter will also start here next year.
[time=939] That's right Rebecca and Stephanie are very good friends. I'm glad they can be in school together.
[time=943] Black Hawk Christian School is a fully accredited school from Kindergarten through the 12th grade and we've had a number of graduating classes.
[time=950] How have our students done as they've graduated and gone on to the university level?
[time=955] We're really proud of what our students have done in college.
[time=958] Several of them are carrying four point averages and a couple graduating classes have now graduated from universities and are busy helping us by sending us alumni fun checks often.
[time=969] Well that's been exciting to see that the students remember the school and really appreciate what you and the other faculty have done here.
[time=977] I'm grateful for that.
[time=978] Steve we don't have a script and I'm just asking you questions as they come to my mind but tell the people as quickly as you can with the philosophy of our Christian education is.
[time=988] Our school is founded on the fact that we believe the Bible is true.
[time=992] That Jesus Christ needs to be the center of everything that we do so we hire people who believe that and also we teach curriculum that is centered on that fact.
[time=1002] We trust that the Lord is going to lead us as we try to center everything that we do educationally spiritually, physically for our students in him.
[time=1010] Steve one of the things that's been encouraging to me is to know that students who've come from various walks of life to our school have come to know Christ as Savior.
[time=1019] Yes even these past three weeks we've had two new students that have come to know Christ as their Savior and hopefully that's going to continue to take place.
[time=1027] Obviously Steve and I are committed to the spiritual side of education but we don't want you to think that black car Christian school is simply an extension of Sunday school.
[time=1037] It is a fully accredited academic program of which the graduate are doing very very well. Thank you for mentioning that.
[time=1044] You may be interested in black car Christian school for your children or perhaps for your grandchildren.
[time=1049] Steve how can they register and when?
[time=1052] Registration for the public opens up March 14th. You can be here at the school with your application filled out please call us at 749-8524 if you would like an application and then on March 14th you'll be able to turn that in.
[time=1068] Also if people wanted to write they can write to us at Black Hawk Baptist Church and Christian school 7321 East State Boulevard Fort Wayne Indiana 46815.
[time=1081] Steve thank you for joining us this morning and sharing the school anything else that you would like to say.
[time=1087] I'm just really thankful that our church has provided us with an opportunity to meet these children's needs.
[time=1092] Working with the families in our school we're able to do that and I'm grateful.
[time=1095] Well we're glad that you're here and Kathy and I particularly so for our school.
[time=1100] Today just before we go back to our morning worship service I want to encourage you to write for a helpful booklet entitled Singleness.
[time=1109] I just read a letter this morning that came from a Bible our viewer who talked about the tragic loss of her husband.
[time=1117] She's a relatively young lady in her 50s and she wrote and saying I'm looking for some guidance in life.
[time=1123] Well singleness may be something that you've been living with for all of your life or it may be something that might be described as single again.
[time=1132] This booklet by Charles Wendell I know will be a big help to you but perhaps you're more like me.
[time=1138] You're married have children and singleness is far from your mind.
[time=1142] We would still love for you to have a copy so you might understand how other people are living their life and what principles God would have for that situation.
[time=1151] Right to us today at the Bible our box fifteen thousand Fort Wayne Indiana four six eight one five.
[time=1162] Once again the address is the Bible our box fifteen thousand Fort Wayne Indiana four six eight one five.
[time=1172] Steve and viewing audience thank you today for joining us as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1178] I hope that you'll have both an open Bible and an open heart.
[time=1208] [MUSIC - 143 seconds]
[time=1376] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1382] Thank you men would you stand with us now that we might pray together God in his word invites us to come to this place Jesus called the temple a house of prayer let us stand together and we will pray.
[time=1396] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=1444] Our father we sense a coldness about our own life that you have called us out of a world of care.
[time=1453] You have drawn us to a place of quietness of repose.
[time=1461] And so fathers we meet this morning we would ask you to be the one who would speak to each heart today including my own.
[time=1472] God we would want to leave this place different than we came in.
[time=1479] We would want to leave with a sense of urgency about the Lord Jesus and sharing him.
[time=1488] We would want to leave with a sense of priority about our spiritual life.
[time=1495] Father we would want to leave with a sense of refreshment that we might sing it as well with my soul.
[time=1504] Most of all father we would want to leave with a sense of gratification that we have been with you.
[time=1512] So today father through your word we pray that you would minister to each one particularly those whose burdens seem enormous the magnitude beyond their ability to shoulder.
[time=1526] God may they find you shouldering their storm with them.
[time=1531] We pray particularly for those whose own lives have been devastated by trauma within their home and in their marriage.
[time=1540] God we pray that you bring healing to damaged hearts.
[time=1544] Father we pray for Tonya that her recovery emotionally and spiritually might continue.
[time=1550] Pray for her family that you would continue to strengthen them.
[time=1554] Father we pray today for those who financial difficulties have got a strangle grip on them that you'll give them wisdom to manage their resources and supply their need according to your riches.
[time=1568] Father we pray today for Jim Pearson's father who discovered over the weekend cancerous tumor in his brain.
[time=1582] We would pray for Stephanie Ewing, Mary Lampman who battle cancer, Hazel Huber that you would stand by their side and strengthen them.
[time=1595] We pray for Richard Hershey, Ralph Kramer whose life is so fragile that you would be of comfort to them and their families.
[time=1607] We pray for Michelle Short as she recovers from such an extensive surgery.
[time=1614] We pray for the family of little Fisher as he has passed away this week.
[time=1620] God we mourn with those who mourn, weep with those who weep, but also today we would rejoice with those who rejoice.
[time=1629] Thank you for those lives today that have experienced the blessing of someone coming to know Christ of a marriage that's been healed.
[time=1638] Prayers that have been answered, hope that's been restored. So God today, make of us men and women who are able to the circumstances, caring and compassionate, courageous and victorious, not in ourselves, but in you, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1665] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1669] In a letter from Bob Foster to a group of men that he writes, he said, "People are a lot like ships. There are three types of ships, barges that have to be pulled through life,
[time=1686] sailboats that move but with the winds of favorable circumstances behind them, and steamboats, those that move by internal power."
[time=1699] I think he was right. Which type of person are you? Are you a barge that everywhere you go in life, you have to be pulled or pushed, you don't make it unless somebody else supplies the energy in the direction?
[time=1713] Are you at least a sailboat moving at least with the winds of the time, but wouldn't it be better to be a steamboat?
[time=1724] Somebody whose life has a sense of internal power that it moves onward.
[time=1732] It seems that there are people in life who are constantly drifting, and every time you meet them they're up or down depending on that day's weather.
[time=1742] Oh, not so much the outside weather is the weather of their own life.
[time=1748] They're just kind of drifting where the wind would go.
[time=1751] Others are those barges that they rest heavy in the water, and it takes a great deal to move them.
[time=1762] Sometimes that's a description of spiritual life, but usually a description of their life in general.
[time=1771] I remember Mark Twain writing about Huckleberry Finn and his great fondness for going to church. He didn't like it.
[time=1779] He said, "The winter douglas drug him there." It seems that a lot of us are going through life with the winter douglas dragging us somewhere.
[time=1790] But then there are those rare men and women who each step of their life seems to be designed and purposeful.
[time=1797] It seems as though each step they take was well thought through and the exact right step to take.
[time=1805] It seems as though everything they do has a thought through order to their life, as though from the inside they were controlling things on the outside.
[time=1818] Well, if ever there was a man who moved through internal power, it was the Apostle Paul.
[time=1825] And we have a good biography of him in the scriptures, and in 1 Corinthians 9 we come to a man who was a true steamboat, someone who moved by internal power.
[time=1837] Open your Bible with me, if you would please, to 1 Corinthians 9.
[time=1842] And again, allow me to set the stage of context. Paul is answering questions.
[time=1848] The question that he is now addressing in chapters 7, 8, 9 and 10 is a question that relates to how do you handle some areas of life that are not clearly right, nor are they clearly wrong.
[time=1862] The kind of that gray middle area dealing with the doubtfuls, and he's written to them some principles, and now he moves into an opening of his own life to give them a window as to how he lives.
[time=1877] And he has talked about a couple of rights that he has. One is a right to get married, another is a right to collect income from his work as an apostle.
[time=1887] You know, he had a little business card that said Paul, Apostle, missionary, ambassador, witness, healer, gift of knowledge, discernment, unlimited.
[time=1898] You know, if anybody had the gifts, he had them. But he said, and I have the right when I go and minister somewhere to ask for what we would call today an honorarium.
[time=1908] He says, but I am giving up that, right? Why? What motivated Paul? What was the steam that drove the engine?
[time=1918] And the reason why I want to know is because I want it to be in my life and in yours. 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 16.
[time=1929] For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory. For necessity is laid upon me. Yay? Whoa, is unto me if I preach not the gospel.
[time=1946] For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward. But if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me, what then is my reward?
[time=1958] Verily, that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge that I abuse not my right in the gospel.
[time=1971] For though I am free from all men, yet have I made myself a servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
[time=1980] Under the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law.
[time=1997] To them that are without the law as without law, being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without law.
[time=2012] To the weak I became as weak that I might gain the weak. I have made all things to all men that I might save some.
[time=2024] And this I do for the gospel sake that I might be partakers of it with you.
[time=2032] This steam engine that we call the apostle Paul was a man who I believe here tells us what motivated him through life.
[time=2040] I believe he's giving us two things that motivated him. First of all a sense of duty before God.
[time=2048] Now Paul saying I'm preaching and I'm preaching without receiving financial resources so no one can say oh that Paul he's in it for the money.
[time=2058] There's gold in that religion business. He said I'm making it of no charge.
[time=2063] But verse 16 he says for though I preach the gospel I can't brag about this. I can't boast about it because he says necessity is laid on me.
[time=2075] Well let me help you with the new international version which says I am compelled to preach the gospel.
[time=2083] Paul says within me there is something that motivates me something that pushes me something that drives me I have to do it.
[time=2093] It's the way I made I must preach the gospel.
[time=2098] It was something that was within Paul and you and I know very clearly what that is. It was the Spirit of God that came into Paul just as the Spirit of God comes into every one of us who are believers in Christ and God begins to use our life.
[time=2114] And Paul knew that God wanted to use him to share Christ in places that no one else had ever dared to go and in ways that no one else had ever thought of.
[time=2126] But Paul saying wait a minute I can't brag about this because I'm compelled to do it.
[time=2135] I'm made to do this and I'm just living out the thing for which God has made me.
[time=2141] There was an excellent movie out a few years ago called Chariots of Fire. Many of you saw that it received numerous Academy Awards was the story of a man by name of Eric Little.
[time=2153] He was a Scottish man who ran in the Olympics. He was also a deeply committed Christian committed to going to the field of China and serving Christ.
[time=2166] His family was very proud of both of his interest running and missionary work and a number of them were trying to push him to go to the mission field and not go to the Olympics to get there sooner.
[time=2181] And Eric Little explained this. He said God has made me fast and I feel his pleasure when I run.
[time=2193] That's a man who said I know why God has made me and I feel the fulfillment of his blessing when I run.
[time=2203] The Apostle Paul says I know why God has made me and I feel his pleasure when I preach the gospel.
[time=2214] Paul understood that when Christ appeared into him on a road to Damascus. Are you familiar with that story?
[time=2223] Many are because we heard it in our little years of Sunday school but perhaps not all of us do.
[time=2230] Initially Paul was very antagonistic to Christ. He was contemporary with Christ and hostile.
[time=2239] So hostile he conspired to the death of Stephen and he began a search and seizure operation whereby he was going through Jerusalem finding all the Christians he could seizing them and turning them over to the local authorities to be held.
[time=2256] As his search and seizure operation grew he spread out beyond Jerusalem and he heard that there were many Christians in the city of Damascus so he with appropriate papers headed to that city.
[time=2272] But an unscheduled stop greeted him in route. A light from heaven blinding striking him to the ground appeared.
[time=2284] And then a voice saying "Saul? Saul? Why do you persecute me? Who is it Lord?" responded the stricken Saul.
[time=2301] Jesus identified himself and Paul obviously became convinced that Jesus was no man who died on the cross but that he was indeed God's son.
[time=2313] Resurrected and alive. And from that very moment on he saw that God wanted to use him.
[time=2323] But later in his life Paul then said in Galatians chapter 115 "It was God who separated me from my mother's womb."
[time=2332] Paul said "My life as purposeful in the hand of God didn't come at conversion but from my very birth God was working in my life."
[time=2342] Paul was raised as a Hebrew of Hebrews. God used that prior training to make him a witness to the Jewish world.
[time=2350] Paul was also a student of Gamelia of the line of Socrates, Aristotle and Plato. God used that training to make him an ambassador to the Greeks.
[time=2361] Paul saying "I sense that God had a purpose for my life. Not only from conversion but from the very day I was born and he said I am compelled within to preach the gospel."
[time=2376] And the whole premise I'm sharing this with you beloved is I believe that God's purposes are equally as clear for your life and mind today as they were the Apostle Paul.
[time=2390] I don't believe that God ever intended there to be a group of super Christians who were able to leap tall buildings in a single bound and the rest of us are just supposed to go "Oh look at that guy!"
[time=2404] I believe God has a purpose for each of our lives. Now your life or my life may never be as public as the Apostle Paul's but I believe it can have just as much fulfillment if we are totally yielded to Christ.
[time=2419] Paul said "God had a plan for my life and I can't brag about being an Apostle. I'm just doing what he's compelled me to do."
[time=2428] Reminds me of Jeremiah the prophet back in the Old Testament. In the 20th chapter Jeremiah gives up.
[time=2436] He has been warning the two southern tribes of impending danger and they lived in days of great prosperity.
[time=2445] And Jeremiah the prophet would say "disaster's coming" and they'd say "disaster's coming." He'd say "doom is coming" and they'd say "doom is coming" and they just played him down.
[time=2455] Matter of fact they nicknamed him "mego amisabe" which simply means terror on every side because here they are enjoying life and Jeremiah the prophet comes saying "it's bad out there, you better watch it" and they're going "it's bad out there, we'll watch it" and they just kind of placated him.
[time=2470] He got sick of it. The mockery, the humiliation and he said "God, that's it. I'm not going to speak another word in your name.
[time=2482] I quit. I don't know where a prophet goes to resign but Jeremiah was looking for that place."
[time=2489] And then a few verses later in chapter 9, right around verse 20 he said "But thy word, God, was a like a fire burning within my heart and I could not put it out."
[time=2504] Paul said "God compels me from within."
[time=2511] We live in a time when there's being much said about stress and personality types and people who seem to be driven people.
[time=2521] And there's a great danger in being a driver, an overachiever.
[time=2526] In a new book by Gordon McDonald that he calls ordering your private world, he distinguishes the personality from the spirit-led person.
[time=2537] There's a personality of a driver that is different from the personality of a believer who is being spirit-led.
[time=2544] He uses some nomenclature to separate the two. He speaks as the one is being driven and the other person is being called.
[time=2552] I like those words. Driven says "I must do it." And the emphasis is on the "I."
[time=2562] We're called says "God has called me." And the emphasis is on God.
[time=2569] McDonald makes these points of distinction about being a driven person versus a called person.
[time=2575] Let me list them very quickly and please take inventory only on yourself and not your husband.
[time=2581] One, driven men or women are most often preoccupied with accomplishments.
[time=2594] What they're getting done or what they must get done.
[time=2597] They're very oriented towards accomplishment. Secondly and similarly they're preoccupied with the symbols of accomplishment.
[time=2606] Some of you guys are like me. There is nothing better than a law and freshly cut.
[time=2612] You can visualize that accomplishment and you can also say I don't have to do that for another week.
[time=2619] Visualizing the accomplishment, the symbols of it. Thirdly often driven people are caught in an uncontrolled pursuit of expansion.
[time=2632] Churches are very capable of falling into that mode. An uncontrolled pursuit of expansion.
[time=2640] Fourthly limited regard for integrity. You've got to get the job done and occasionally you just have to cross a few lines.
[time=2651] Driven people have a limited regard for integrity. Fifthly limited people often have limited or underdeveloped people skills.
[time=2663] They get the job done. It's this trail of dead bodies they've stepped over that makes you take notice.
[time=2670] Driven people often have limited people skills. Sixthly they tend to be highly competitive.
[time=2680] Seventhly they occasionally are given to bursts of explosive anger and eighthly they're abnormally busy.
[time=2693] Now as we're talking about being a steamboat here we're trying to distinguish between the personality type that's a driven person
[time=2702] in a phrase they're compulsive, obsessively so, so that they always must be growing. They always must be expanding
[time=2712] and if you go out for a cup of coffee they will win. There are those types. I think many of us are prone to fall into that trap.
[time=2724] I think here Paul is not talking about a driven man. He's what Gordon McDonald is referring to a called man or woman.
[time=2732] A person who's not going and striving because it's their nature but because it's their new nature. It's because God is in control.
[time=2742] And you know that takes away some of these traits. That's why the apostle Paul could suffer abuse and rejection. Why?
[time=2751] Because he wasn't driven to accomplish something he was called to go and he could let the results rest with God.
[time=2758] He wasn't a competitive person. People came and say Paul this one while you're in prison he's out there preaching the gospel and Paul said great that's the idea.
[time=2768] What made Paul move? It was that he was called and he was compelled by the Spirit of God and he said this whoa is me if I don't preach.
[time=2783] I've heard people share Christ with someone who didn't know Jesus as Savior and they often say you'll never know true happiness until you come to Christ.
[time=2792] And the most miserable person is the person who doesn't know Christ. I disagree. That's probably the second most miserable person.
[time=2801] The most miserable person is the person who does know Christ is Savior but is not walking in the calling that God has called them.
[time=2810] I said that in the first service and three people came forward to say I'm in that second group. I know Christ but I haven't been following him.
[time=2821] You see when we study the word God makes his will known. I don't know that he tells you when you stand in front of a vending machine whether to get coke or diet coke.
[time=2830] But I believe God has a plan for each of our lives and by his word and his spirit he moves us and if we don't obey him whoa is on us.
[time=2841] I think when Paul said whoa he was referring to two things first of all an inner turmoil because outside of the will of God you will be miserable regardless of your circumstances and in the will of God you will find peace regardless of your circumstances.
[time=2858] Now I'm not promising if you walk in God's will that you'll be walking on roses. If you're walking on roses watch out there'll be some thorns.
[time=2869] God never promised an easy road but he did promise of peace as we go through those difficult roads.
[time=2876] And whoa is upon me and you if we begin to calculate our living as to how we can live our life outside of God's plan.
[time=2886] You know what God's plan for your life is for your dating life for your marriage for your finances. You know what God's plan for you is.
[time=2895] You better follow it because whoa is going to be on each of us if we don't.
[time=2902] As the church we had the privilege of having Dr. Ken Nichols on our staff for four or five years.
[time=2907] I remember him saying often that people come to him for counsel and they don't come through the door and say Dr. Nichols what can I do to get my life into harmony with God's word.
[time=2922] He said they almost never come in with that attitude. Now they never say it but here's what they want without putting it in the words they're saying Dr. Nichols I know what God's will for my life is and I'd really like to do something different.
[time=2939] And what I would like you to do Dr. Nichols is help me to be happy in my disobedience. Do you have any advice for me?
[time=2950] Very similar to Jonah the prophet. Do you remember God called Jonah to the city of Nineveh? From Israel that would be north and east. The first thing he did was had south and west and he got on a boat that was heading further west to the land of Tarshish.
[time=2966] Why Tarshish? Because that was the furthest point in the world that Jonah knew about.
[time=2973] If there would have been an awareness in his mind that there was an America he would have probably headed there. God said head northeast and he said got you Lord and headed southwest.
[time=2986] You know the rest of the story. God had a way of motivating Jeremiah or excuse me Jonah that he never dreamed about.
[time=2997] In Hebrews it warns us that if we know what God wants us to do and we do the opposite that we are going to make ourselves subject to the chastening hand of God.
[time=3008] Not only will there be inner turmoil but secondly God will physically in some way get our attention.
[time=3018] Paul was a steamboat because there was a sense of duty within him that compelled him to share Christ.
[time=3025] It came from the inside and ordered his life and pushed him forward.
[time=3030] I believe God has an equally clear plan for you and for me.
[time=3035] You may say well I'm not the Apostle Paul. Congratulations that makes two of us but that doesn't exempt us from having a responsibility to know him and to know what his will is and obeying it.
[time=3048] And then our life will take on a sense of order because we're motivated from within and not always reacting to the things that happen on the outside.
[time=3060] Paul said whoa is me if I preach not the gospel. He said for if I do it willingly I have a reward.
[time=3068] But if against my will not that I mean he was unwilling to do it but he said if I'm drafted then I'm just simply discharging a responsibility.
[time=3077] It's a lot like military service. If you get drafted and you go then there's no congratulations in order because you're simply discharging your responsibility to our country.
[time=3088] But if you enlist then some congratulations are in order because you did it of your own choosing.
[time=3093] Paul said I can't even brag about serving the Lord because I'm a drafty. But then he does say but I do have this extra reward that although I've been drafted I'm doing it for free.
[time=3107] He said I'm not collecting any income from the ministry. Why? So that no one can say all that Paul. Yeah he's compelled to preach the gospel but I'll tell you he's found the way to get around some of those IRS regulations and I'll tell you he's not doing too bad.
[time=3122] He said I'm not going to collect any of that money so that no one will ever say anything about me that will keep someone else from coming to Christ.
[time=3135] What motivated Paul first of all duty a compelling sense that he was doing the duty that God had called him for but secondly he was also motivated by a devotion to people.
[time=3148] In verses 19 through 23 Paul said I am free from all men. We've talked a lot in the last few weeks about being single because that's what chapter seven held up as a great lifestyle.
[time=3164] You know when you're married and have children you're not free from all men. Kathy has a responsibility to me. I have a responsibility to her. We have three little children that take time.
[time=3177] I'm not free to do anything that I want to do. I've got responsibility to family. You and I are not free. We have a responsibility to an employer. Most of us.
[time=3188] Most of us are somewhere on a middle rung in a corporate ladder and there are people above us who make all these decisions and they pass out memos.
[time=3198] Paul said I'm free from all men. He said there's nobody who pushes a button and I jump. He said I have no obligations to anyone but myself. I'm a free agent. I'm playing out my option.
[time=3213] And the next statement is though I am free from all men yet I have made myself a servant unto all.
[time=3223] Paul said I don't care who they are great or small. I'm going to be their servant. I'm going to give up my rights. I'm going to jump when they push my button.
[time=3232] Why? Why would he do that? He tells us so that I might gain the more.
[time=3239] That little word that occurs several times in these verses. It represents in grammar what we would call purpose clause. Listen to what he said.
[time=3248] I became a slave to all so that I might gain the more. I became a Jew to the Jews so that I might gain the Jews. I became as under the law to those that are under the law. Why?
[time=3264] So that I could gain those who are under the law. I became as without law meaning a Gentile. Why did he do that so that he could gain the Gentiles?
[time=3274] He said I became like a weak brother. Why did he do that so that he could gain the weak?
[time=3281] Paul said I'm going to accommodate my life. I'm going to yield my rights so that wherever I'm at I can influence those people for Christ.
[time=3291] He had a devotion for people. He was consumed that other people know Christ.
[time=3296] I think the principle that he's teaching here is that Paul was willing to find out where the people were and to find common ground with them.
[time=3305] And I think that's our responsibility. Francis Schafer correctly said before his death that we live in a post-Christian world.
[time=3315] The days are over when non-Christians are going to get up on Sunday morning, tie their tie too tight like the rest of us and come here with a sober face and endure this half hour.
[time=3326] They're saying no thanks. It used to be the non-Christians went to church and droves and so this was like a big aquarium and you hire an evangelist who comes and he fishes out of the aquarium.
[time=3338] It doesn't happen anymore. We've got to take the church to the people. Isn't that biblical? Isn't that what the disciples did? They weren't where the people were.
[time=3350] That's what Paul did. And he said I found common ground. If someone was Jewish I spoke good Hebrew to them.
[time=3360] He went into the temple long after his a Christian took a vow made a sacrifice. Why? That's what the Jews were doing. He could live with that.
[time=3368] He went to where the Gentiles were. He acted just like a Gentile, past the sausage. He said I'll find common ground.
[time=3378] He was around these strong brothers who said I can eat meat off or dietals and Paul said cut me off a leg.
[time=3386] He was around these brothers who were weak and said I can't eat this meat. It's been offered to Gentiles and Paul said no thank you I don't care for any.
[time=3395] He found common ground. You know if we really love people we'll find common ground.
[time=3403] Evangelism probably will not take place in the next ten years in large crusades although if they're available they're great.
[time=3411] It probably won't happen through morning worship services although from time to time it does but it will happen in interest groups.
[time=3420] When doctors get together with other doctors, when teachers get together with other teachers, when factory workers get together with other factory workers right there in the shop.
[time=3429] When housewives go next door and borrow a cup of sugar and don't leave a track when you return it.
[time=3436] But who just lovingly build common ground in relationships flow life to life.
[time=3442] Well what motivated this steam engine that we call the Apostle Paul two things.
[time=3448] A sense of duty to God and a sense of devotion to people.
[time=3457] My heart's desire is that each of us become steam ships.
[time=3463] That we're not barges being pulled through life nor are we sailboats that are subject to changing tides and shifting winds.
[time=3472] But that we are men and women driven by an internal power that comes from the Spirit of God.
[time=3479] The only way that can happen is for you to receive that Spirit or receiving Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3485] Have you ever opened up your heart and received Him? If you've never done that, would you do it today? I pray that you will.
