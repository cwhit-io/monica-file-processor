[time=118] [MUSIC]
[time=124] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=127] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=142] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=145] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=173] Please remain standing with me.
[time=175] We welcome you to our service today, and we especially welcome those that are viewing through the television to the Bible Hour.
[time=182] We're glad that you're with us.
[time=184] And while you're standing, just greet one another around you and smile at them and tell them that you're glad they're here, and then you may be seated.
[time=191] [MUSIC]
[time=218] I trust that we have made any visitors that have with us right at home, and we are glad that you're here, and will you join with us in the singing, so we pray together and as we worship through the message this morning.
[time=230] Let's listen to our choir now as they speak of the Shure Foundation.
[time=234] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=240] [MUSIC]
[time=250] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood
[time=257] and righteousness.
[time=261] I am here to trust us.
[time=264] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=414] Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.
[time=420] This is my story.
[time=422] This is my song.
[time=423] Him number 51, let us sing with confidence.
[time=426] Him number 51, Blessed Assurance.
[time=429] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=570] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=573] We appreciate it when you participate in the music.
[time=576] I trust that the words, though quite familiar to us, just remind you of the sure foundation upon which we find ourselves in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=585] Our pastor Rick Hawks is not with us today.
[time=588] He went with George Lattman as they had final services for Mary Lattman, last Saturday in Pennsylvania, and then he stopped at his home in Akron, Ohio to visit his grandmother, who is very ill.
[time=601] I want to thank the congregation for their support of Mary and George Lattman during her illness and death.
[time=606] You all were so good in sending cards and helping out with meals taken day in and day out to their home and the support in the memorial service.
[time=615] Mary went to be with the Lord last Monday evening.
[time=617] It's a time of rejoicing for her.
[time=619] It'll be a time of sadness and a support that is needed for George in the days as he adjusts without his mate.
[time=626] Let's continue to pray for George and ask the Lord to strengthen him during this time.
[time=632] Our ministry of music is very important at the church and we trusted it uplifts you as the choir sings and as we sing together as a congregation, that's very important to me.
[time=642] And then as us soloists sing, let's listen as Susan Toyrac comes to minister to us through the medium of music.
[time=648] Listen to the message that she has for us.
[time=650] [MUSIC] If ever I forget you [MUSIC] And I refuse to love you [MUSIC] Love you, Lord [MUSIC] More than my highest joy [MUSIC] I've never want to sing again [MUSIC]
[time=690] [MUSIC - 66 seconds]
[time=761] [MUSIC] If ever I deny you [MUSIC] And I begin to wonder [MUSIC] Wonder from your path [MUSIC] Like I could make it on my own [MUSIC] Use your rod and lead me home [MUSIC] Use your rod and lead me home [MUSIC] For only you are worthy [MUSIC] Only you are holy [MUSIC] Only you deserve all of my heart [MUSIC] Only you receive me [MUSIC] Only you can keep me [MUSIC] Only you can fill my life with sound [MUSIC] You fill my life with song [MUSIC] You fill my life with song [MUSIC] For only you are worthy [MUSIC] Only you are holy [MUSIC] Only you deserve all of my heart [MUSIC] Only you receive me [MUSIC] Only you can keep me [MUSIC] Only you can fill my life with sound [MUSIC] You fill my life with song [MUSIC] You fill my life with song [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Oh Father in heaven [MUSIC] We honor Your name [MUSIC] Oh Father in heaven [MUSIC] We honor Your name [MUSIC] We want Your kingdom to come [MUSIC] We want Your will to be done here on earth [MUSIC] As in heaven above [MUSIC] Give us this day [MUSIC] Please give us our daily prayer [MUSIC] And forgive our sins [MUSIC] Just as we have come [MUSIC] For others [MUSIC] This will bring us to temptation [MUSIC] Please don't bring us to temptation [MUSIC] But deliver us [MUSIC] Oh deliver us [MUSIC] From evil one [MUSIC] For Yours is the kingdom [MUSIC] Yours is the power [MUSIC] 'Til you begin glory [MUSIC] Now and forever more [MUSIC] 'Til you begin glory [MUSIC] Now and forever more [MUSIC] Amen, amen [MUSIC] Amen, amen [MUSIC] Oh, let the beauty of the Lord [MUSIC] Feel this place [MUSIC] Come, oh, come, Lord Jesus [MUSIC] Oh, let thy glory hover over us [MUSIC] As we pray [MUSIC] Come, oh, come, Lord Jesus â™ª
[time=1485] Father, we want to thank you for the sustaining power that you've given us throughout this last week.
[time=1490] And we thank you that you've taken Mary to be with you.
[time=1494] We do pray that you'll give strength to George now in this time of recovery of the loss of his wife and mate.
[time=1501] And Lord, we pray for Karen Kramer and her family as they lost their father and husband.
[time=1508] We pray that you'll just comfort them.
[time=1510] And for Bob and Barb Sustorf, we pray that you'll just be with them
[time=1516] in the loss of Barb's mother.
[time=1519] We help them to draw upon the strength and the peace that you can give in this particular time.
[time=1526] And we pray for those that are ill.
[time=1528] We pray for David Norton.
[time=1529] We thank you for his life.
[time=1531] And we pray now that you'll just give wisdom in the time of recuperation from this heart attack that things will go well and that he might be able to be restored to normal health.
[time=1541] We thank you for the good reports of Darlene Johnson and her operation.
[time=1545] And we pray that you'll continue to strengthen her body.
[time=1548] And for Susan Kaminsky's father as he has surgery tomorrow, we pray that you'll just guide the doctors and that this surgery might benefit him and that his health will be better.
[time=1561] We pray for Richard Hershey as he lays in a coma.
[time=1564] We pray that you'll just strengthen the family and allow them to accept your will in his life.
[time=1571] Lord, we thank you for the encouragement and support that our family of believers here at Black Hawk give to one another.
[time=1577] Thank you for the cards that they're willing to send and the prayer that's given forth on behalf of those that are in need.
[time=1583] We pray for Rick's grandmother today.
[time=1585] She's very ill.
[time=1587] We pray that you'll just help Rick to be a minister ministering to his own family today and give him strength and time of recuperation while he's gone from us.
[time=1597] And now Lord, we pray for this message.
[time=1599] We pray for Dr. Dixon.
[time=1601] We thank you that you've brought him here and we look forward to what you have to say through him.
[time=1607] May this be a time of rejoicing as we study God's word together and grow.
[time=1611] Thank you for the wonderful gift of salvation.
[time=1614] In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[time=1617] Dr. Dixon.
[time=1622] It's certainly a pleasure for me to be back at Black Hawk.
[time=1626] I recall having the first evangelistic campaign in this church years ago and then watching the blessing of the Lord upon you as a people and your leadership.
[time=1639] And I continue to rejoice not only in how God blesses you but also in the relationship we have at Cedarville College with Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1652] Our hearts go out to you as a college family.
[time=1656] During this particular time of sorrow, we've just experienced the same thing.
[time=1662] One of our very fine young men, a senior preparing to graduate in June, went home to be with the Lord a week ago Wednesday in an automobile accident.
[time=1673] Had a memorial service on Friday, a week ago Friday, and then sent our Vice President of Campus Ministries held green to Othello, Washington to be in the funeral there this past Monday.
[time=1686] For our college family, especially our student body, our memorial service was conducted by the students.
[time=1693] I participated at their invitation.
[time=1696] It was totally run by the students.
[time=1699] One of the things that came across so clearly by them is that they suddenly realized that young people die too.
[time=1708] Scripture says, "My age is as nothing before thee." So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
[time=1720] We're thankful for what God is doing here through this time of trial and what God is doing at Cedarville.
[time=1726] May I suggest that it is during these times where truly the church has the opportunity to testify to the grace of God and what it means
[time=1737] to be believers, that special relationship we have with our God
[time=1743] and the special relationship we have with one another.
[time=1747] God does continue to bless Cedarville.
[time=1750] Let me share with you that we set another record enrollment this last fall of over 1800.
[time=1756] That's seven years of consecutive record enrollments.
[time=1761] Cedarville now being one of the largest Christian liberal arts colleges in the United States.
[time=1767] It has also been one of the fastest growing Christian liberal arts colleges in the country.
[time=1773] In 1978, we had 1,185 students.
[time=1776] Now going to 1,817 applications coming in all the time had more
[time=1782] applications in the month of January than any month in the history of the college.
[time=1787] So the Lord is just blessing us abundantly.
[time=1789] We thank Him for it.
[time=1790] People ask, "Why is it that in this time of trauma in higher education, Cedarville continues to do so well?" Well, first of all, we know it's God.
[time=1798] Secondly, it's because Cedarville has uniquely blended an exceptional academic program without sacrificing spiritual fervor.
[time=1808] That blend has caused us to have a special niche in many, many young people
[time=1814] looking our way for Christian liberal arts education.
[time=1817] Out of ten major vocational fields, Cedarville offers nine of them.
[time=1823] Our largest major is business.
[time=1826] Strong teacher education program, Bible program preparing pastors and missionaries in evangelist.
[time=1833] In our pre-med program, 75% of the young people accepted into med school.
[time=1838] Our bachelor's science of nursing program is only five years old, graduated our first class, have 180 in the program, and we will hear this next week if we have received national league of nursing accreditation.
[time=1852] We have a strong pre-law program with graduates in law school in Notre Dame and Wake Forest and Duke in Northwestern.
[time=1860] And the list just goes on and on.
[time=1862] The only major area that we do not have is a four-year engineering program.
[time=1866] We have pre-engineering where every student in that program has been accepted in engineering school.
[time=1872] Right now, we have a feasibility study underway to start electrical and mechanical engineering.
[time=1879] A tremendous need today for a fundamentalist institution like Cedarville to be located in this part of the country where Christian young people can go for their engineering.
[time=1890] And we're doing the study to see if that's what God wants us to do.
[time=1893] You pray for us as we continue to do that.
[time=1896] So God's blessing academically.
[time=1898] But it's not just that.
[time=1900] We have chapel every day, five days a week, bringing some of the greatest speakers in America across our platform.
[time=1906] We have a strong emphasis in evangelism.
[time=1909] Our kids volunteer, eighty-five percent of them, to go out and witness, do something for the Lord Jesus during the week.
[time=1916] We have gospel teams that go into four hundred churches every twelve months.
[time=1921] Missions emphasis where a hundred of our young people go to the mission field every summer.
[time=1926] And just amazing what God is doing and we're so thankful for it.
[time=1931] We give him the praise.
[time=1932] Out on the table, we have one of our Cedarville College view books.
[time=1936] And we'd like for you to have one.
[time=1938] All you have to do is just go by and pick it up and take it home with you for those watching on television.
[time=1943] Just write me at Cedarville College, Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=1946] We'll be glad to send you one.
[time=1947] We also have our torch magazine.
[time=1949] This goes to sixty thousand people.
[time=1952] Across the United States, every quarter free of charge, and I'd like for you to have it.
[time=1957] All you have to do is pick one up and then take the time to put your name and address on the sheet and we'll see that you get it.
[time=1964] The new one will be coming out just in the next two weeks on the Christian and free enterprise.
[time=1971] And why at Cedarville College we refuse all the federal funds.
[time=1975] Why we refuse the state funds.
[time=1977] Why I believe that we believe it's important to not only give lip service but to be committed to the free enterprise system.
[time=1984] You'll want to get that.
[time=1985] It has the President's report, the Annual President's report in it, sign up on the sheet and we'll see that you get that.
[time=1992] Please take the time to do it.
[time=1995] Greatest preacher who ever lived was Jesus Christ.
[time=2002] And one of the greatest sermons he ever preached was the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2009] I'd like for you to turn there with me.
[time=2011] Please, Matthew chapter seven.
[time=2015] Jesus was a great preacher because he not only preached truth but he preached so people could understand.
[time=2025] He made his messages clear.
[time=2028] He was very pointed.
[time=2030] He illustrated well.
[time=2033] And I think an interesting that as Jesus concluded this great sermon that begins in Matthew five verse one, it extends through chapters five, six and seven.
[time=2045] He closed it out on the note of judgment.
[time=2051] The entire seventh chapter of Matthew, the last third of the Sermon on the Mount,
[time=2058] has to do with judgment.
[time=2061] And he gives us an illustration in this chapter that drives home the point of judgment.
[time=2070] In verses 13 and 14, Jesus said, "Enter ye in at the straight gate for wide is the gate,
[time=2079] and broad is the way that lead it to destruction, and many there be which go in there at.
[time=2086] Because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which lead it unto life,
[time=2092] and few there be that find it." It's only Jesus could do. He said, "There are two roads. One is a broad way.
[time=2102] This broad way leads to destruction, and it is crowded with people, many there be which go in there at.
[time=2111] And then there is a narrow way that leads to heaven and that leads to life,
[time=2117] and only a few by the grace of God are on that way." Listen carefully, Jesus said it, "Most people go to hell."
[time=2131] So bring, most people go to hell. Most of the people who've ever lived have lost their souls.
[time=2142] Most of the people on planet earth today are going the broad way that leads to destruction.
[time=2150] A few are on that narrow way that leads to life.
[time=2156] Now the question has to be, "If most people lose their souls, why is that so?"
[time=2163] Well, I am confident we would all conclude it is because we are sinners, and all have sinned,
[time=2169] and come short of the glory of God, and the wages of sin is death.
[time=2174] We also know that most people go to hell very simply because they have not received Jesus Christ as personal Savior,
[time=2181] and He is the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by Him.
[time=2188] But I think there is something else that drives home why most people go to hell.
[time=2195] What I'd like to do this morning is take this broad way Jesus talked about and divide it into three lanes, or three other roads, three sub-roads, with three groups of people that will help us to understand why most people lose their souls,
[time=2212] and two of the three are illustrated in the text.
[time=2217] The first group going to hell is the road of the unconcerned.
[time=2227] Many people die without Christ because they're just flat concerned about everything else,
[time=2234] but about their souls, and about the God who made them, and about eternity.
[time=2241] You begin to think about it, and we're concerned about the Philippines.
[time=2247] We are concerned about the assassination in Sweden, the Middle East, arms control.
[time=2256] We are concerned about balancing the budget, the Graham-Rutman Act.
[time=2261] We are concerned about how we're going to pay our bills and whether we can keep our jobs.
[time=2266] We are concerned about where our kids will go to school, where they will go to college, what's going to happen, who are they going to marry.
[time=2274] We are concerned about our health.
[time=2279] But how many are concerned about the fact that they're the reason they are upon this earth
[time=2285] is because God created them, and God created them for a purpose, and God created them
[time=2292] that they might bring honor and glory to His name, and that we've sinned against this God, and we are separated from this God, and there needs to be a reconciliation with our Creator.
[time=2306] Jesus said in verse 24, "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine,
[time=2313] I now keep in mind that Jesus is talking to the crowd, listing to the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2319] He's drawing it to a close.
[time=2322] Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and do with them, I will like him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock.
[time=2332] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.
[time=2341] And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand.
[time=2350] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it, sermons over."
[time=2361] Now he looked out at the multitude, and he said, "Some of you are going to be like the wise man,
[time=2369] who builds his house upon the rock, who hears my truth, and is concerned about truth,
[time=2375] and builds his life, and his family, and his eternal destiny upon me, and upon my word.
[time=2382] Others are like the foolish man." You're hearing the very same sermon, but you're not interested.
[time=2388] You have other things on your mind, right?
[time=2392] I mean, after all, we all know the problems with attention span.
[time=2396] Jesus, you've been preaching for a long time.
[time=2399] Most of us can only concentrate for about 10 or 12 minutes.
[time=2403] And this guy's there looking right at Jesus, and Jesus is seeing right through him, and he knows where his mind is.
[time=2409] It's back on his boat, and his fishing.
[time=2412] It's back on his family, or he's hungry, and what he's going to have for dinner,
[time=2418] or who's going to win the NCAA game today on CB--no, that wasn't it back in that day.
[time=2425] But his mind is so far away.
[time=2430] Jesus said, "You're like the foolish man, who builds his house upon the sand."
[time=2436] You see, everything looked fine in that subdivision, one house on the rock, one house on the sand, but you can't see the foundation.
[time=2445] They'd wave each other every day as they'd go to work.
[time=2449] Things seemed very secure until all of a sudden one day the clouds gathered and the rain started to fall.
[time=2456] And it just kept falling like out in Northern California this past month.
[time=2461] And the water started coming up, and the wind started blowing, and the waves started beating.
[time=2469] During the course of that time, the house that was built upon the rock, and the Word of God, and Jesus Christ, it weathered the storm.
[time=2478] When it was all over, it was still there, and the man was still there, and the family was still there.
[time=2486] When the rain started coming down, and the water started coming up, and the wind started blowing, and the waves started beating around the house built upon the shifting sands of the materialism of this world.
[time=2499] And the philosophies of this world, everything crashed.
[time=2507] The difference, the foundation. See, a lot of people think that Christians don't have trouble, don't have trial.
[time=2515] Listen, my friend, as a Christian, you may have more trouble than the non-Christian.
[time=2520] Storms come into the lives of believers and unbelievers.
[time=2524] The difference is, if you have a foundation, if your life and everything is built on Jesus Christ and his true.
[time=2533] But oh, if you go the way of the unconcerned, if you go rapidly through life and don't get serious about your soul, that road leads to hell.
[time=2544] Back before Christmas, one of our students called me on the phone and said, "President Dixon, would you have the time to meet with a student at the University of Dayton who is a skeptic and agnostic?
[time=2558] I've been endeavoring to witness to him to no avail.
[time=2561] I'd be glad to do that." So on a given night, we met in the student center.
[time=2566] Our new 70,000 square foot athletic center and with the student center and all that goes with it.
[time=2576] I sat there in that lounge with that young man and that young lady and I heard the typical arguments of the skeptic.
[time=2585] He was not concerned, really. He was at least concerned enough to be there.
[time=2589] He was not serious about his salvation and he had all of his intellectual arguments.
[time=2594] And as we concluded, I said, "Would you mind if I lead in prayer?" He said, "I'm not ready for something like that." I said, "Would you read a couple of books?" He said, "Maybe. Send him two books." Josh McDowell's evidence that demands a verdict in John R. Stott, basic Christianity.
[time=2612] Two of the best books I've ever found to deal with someone like that.
[time=2618] A few weeks later, I saw Rhonda and I said, "How's Brian coming?" She said, "Well, he's watching Charles Stanley." Dr. Stanley's having an impact on his life and he's reading the books.
[time=2629] I said, "Praise the Lord. Let's keep praying." I got back from California two weeks ago, walked down from the platform after chapel
[time=2640] and that's one of the neatest times of the day for me.
[time=2642] I very, very seldom ever miss chapel. I want to be with our students.
[time=2647] Be preaching them twice next week.
[time=2651] As I walked down, there was Brian.
[time=2654] I said, "Brian, how are you?" He said, "Fine. I've been reading the books." I said, "Great." He said, "I need to talk to you." I said, "I can see you tomorrow at 11 o'clock." He said, "I'll be there." Came to my office.
[time=2664] Well, he said, "I got into Josh and I couldn't believe how Josh answered so many of my questions about the reliability of Scripture and against evolution and the existence of God." I have to admit that I got a little bored after a while and switched over to stop.
[time=2679] After I got into stop, I became so enamored with it.
[time=2682] I got all the way through to the last chapter and he had the book with him and it says, "Decision." I already made up my mind if I got as far as decision that I'd have to make a decision and I'm making a decision tonight.
[time=2695] Before I make my decision, the chapter before decision says, "Count the cost." So, I got some questions. I said, "Fine. Fire away." Number one, what is it going to do to my vocational plans if I become a Christian?
[time=2712] Does that mean I have to go to a Christian college?
[time=2716] Does that mean that I cannot go into broadcasting?
[time=2719] Do I have to go to a Christian radio station if I go into broadcasting?" I said, "No." I said, "What does it mean to me and my family?" Well, I said that means you've got to marry a Christian.
[time=2732] It means you're going to have to make a commitment to the Lord.
[time=2735] You're going to commit to yourself that you're going to have a Christian family.
[time=2738] He said, "What's it going to mean to me financially if I become a Christian?" I mean, he had all these things. That's great.
[time=2744] He's asking the right questions.
[time=2746] He's counting the cost.
[time=2748] After we got it all worked through, I said, "Okay, Brian, I can tell you're so close to making a decision for the Lord.
[time=2753] You want me to help?" He said, "No." I said, "I've gone this far with me and the Lord and the books." He said, "I decided I'd make the decision by myself.
[time=2763] I'll let you know tomorrow." Next morning, called Rhonda, he said, "Tell the President that I got saved last night." That's great.
[time=2770] He was on the road of the unconcerned, and he took advantage of the grace of God and received Christ as a Savior, and you can have that same experience today.
[time=2781] That's not the only road that leads to hell.
[time=2784] The road of the concerned who do nothing about it.
[time=2790] Now, this is not illustrated in the text, but it is throughout Scripture.
[time=2797] How many people do we know who plan to become Christians, but for whatever reason, just keep putting it off?
[time=2807] I remember one day when a man by the name of Agrippa, a king, called on another man by the name of Paul.
[time=2817] He said, "I want you to come in and preach one of your famous sermons for me." So in came Paul, four foot eleven and a half.
[time=2829] Right, Paul was under five feet, historians tell us.
[time=2834] He was not much to look at. He was not an orator.
[time=2839] Some say he was cross-eyed, but all what commitment and all what intensity.
[time=2846] And he stood there before that king and all of his royalty and his robes.
[time=2852] And he just simply told what Jesus had done for him.
[time=2856] He said, "Oh, King, this thing was not done in a corner.
[time=2860] No, King, I would that that were fully persuaded, such as I am." And the king interrupted him and said, "Almost thou persuaded me to be a Christian."
[time=2871] Theologians tell us that he was being sarcastic, cynical.
[time=2877] That's what the text and the original language would communicate.
[time=2881] That may be so.
[time=2883] The most cynical, sarcastic people I've ever met are people under the most conviction.
[time=2889] I don't care how he said it, God was speaking to his heart.
[time=2893] And the scripture says he stood up and he walked out.
[time=2896] And as far as we know, he never again came that close to receiving Christ.
[time=2904] I preached in Indianapolis and I gave the invitation.
[time=2910] And a lady standing right on the aisle was obviously moved and concerned and convicted.
[time=2916] And she'd put one foot out in the aisle, then she'd pull it back and another foot and then she'd pull it back.
[time=2925] And all of a sudden she stepped right out in the aisle and others were coming forward.
[time=2929] And I said, "Praise the Lord, she's going to receive Christ today." And she just stopped and stared at me.
[time=2936] And it dawned on me, she was weighing it one more time, "Should I or shouldn't I?" And all of a sudden she turned and ran out on the front door of the church as fast as she could.
[time=2947] I was stunned.
[time=2951] Next day the pastor and I took our Bibles and went over to her house and said, "Ma'am,
[time=2957] we saw you're interested last night and we'd like to come in and take the scriptures and show you how to become a Christian.
[time=2963] Answer your question." She said, "I'm not interested." She said, "Can't we come in at all?" She said, "No." We went away with heavy hearts, closed the evangelistic campaign.
[time=2974] Pastor wrote me a few days later, "For all the lady who ran out of the service was found dead outside the back door of her house last night."
[time=2986] As far as we know, the final decision she made to reject Christ was in a service like this.
[time=2995] The claims of Christ being presented so concerned at the invitation she stepped out in the aisle, but went away without the Lord and was just as lost as someone who never darkened the door of a church or ever heard the gospel.
[time=3007] Just as lost as some heathen over in Africa who's never heard the claims of Christ.
[time=3014] The road of the concern to do nothing about it leads to hell too.
[time=3021] But there's another road with far more people on it than the other two put together.
[time=3025] In fact, this is the crowd I think Jesus has especially had in mind.
[time=3029] Listen closely, it's the road of the concerned who do something about it.
[time=3040] That's right.
[time=3043] They are concerned.
[time=3045] They want to go to heaven. They've done something about it and they think they're going to heaven and they're going to hell.
[time=3052] Verse 21.
[time=3057] Jesus said, "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."
[time=3067] Many will say to me, "In that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works.
[time=3077] And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[time=3086] Do you ever take this section and go back to verses 13 and 14?
[time=3094] These people, the Scriptures say, call him Lord.
[time=3100] And there are many of them, verse 22, many will say unto me.
[time=3108] The Scripture says, "Many there be which go in there at verse 13 on that broad way that leads to destruction."
[time=3118] They will say, "Lord, Lord, we prophesied in thy name we preached, I never knew you.
[time=3128] Lord, we perform miracles in your name, many wonderful works, I never knew you.
[time=3136] Lord, we cast out demons and we did it in your name." People ask me, they say, Brother Dixon, is it possible to cast demons out of someone if you're not a Christian?
[time=3146] I say, absolutely.
[time=3148] The name of the Lord will accomplish much even in the lips of the unbeliever, even in the lips of the pagan.
[time=3158] Jesus didn't argue that they had cast out demons, he just said, "You did it in my name, but I never knew you."
[time=3166] You may be a preacher today, you may be a deacon, you may be a Sunday school teacher, you may sing in the choir,
[time=3172] you may have grown up in a Christian home, you may have walked down an aisle, you may have been baptized,
[time=3179] you may belong to a mainline denomination, but if you've never repeated of your sin and received Jesus Christ by faith,
[time=3187] you're on that broad road that leads to destruction because you think that by joining a church or by being baptized
[time=3195] or by being exposed to Christianity that that'll do it and it won't.
[time=3201] It won't.
[time=3205] Cincinnati's my home.
[time=3209] I didn't go to church as a boy, my parents didn't go to church.
[time=3214] And I remember one day somebody inviting me to go to a Baptist church and I went down to that Baptist church as a visitor
[time=3222] and they, I went to Sunday school for a few weeks and they taught me the golden rule and the ten commandments and in about twelve they came around and said, "Do you like to be baptized?" I said, "I'll have to check with mom and dad." He said, "It might as well, it won't hurt." No one ever explained the gospel.
[time=3239] Found out later it was a liberal Baptist church. They didn't even preach the Bible and get people saved.
[time=3245] They baptized being that liberal Baptist church and I still on that broad road that leads to destruction.
[time=3252] Later I had a friend come around and he said, "Paul, you don't go church much, do you?" I said, "No." He said, "Why don't you go church with me?" I said, "Where do you go?" He said, "I go to the Christian church." I said, "That sounds good. I'll go with you for a while." So I went to Christian church, they came around and they said, "You want to join us?" I said, "It might as well." So I joined the Christian church. No one ever told me I needed to be saved.
[time=3274] They just took me into the Christian church.
[time=3277] I'd only go to these churches a few times and I was more interested in sports on Sunday and the Cincinnati Reds and the Kings, Coney Island and various things.
[time=3288] And so I go maybe three or four times a year.
[time=3292] But he said, "You want to go church with me?" I said, "Where do you go church?" He said, "Methodist church?" I said, "My as well." So I went to the Methodist church.
[time=3302] It was that Baptist church and that Christian church and that Methodist church.
[time=3307] Those were the boring services.
[time=3309] They were so cold. They were so formal.
[time=3313] They said, "Well look, you'll enjoy it better if you come back to our youth group,
[time=3320] M-Y-F Methodist Youth Fellowship." I said, "Okay." They said, "By the way, we have bowling alleys in our church and we're going to give you the honor of being a pinsetter for the ladies bowling league." So I got to set pins for the ladies bowling league, but no one ever told me about Jesus.
[time=3337] One day a fellow came up, he said, "You ever been to revival meeting?" I was about 15 years old. I'd never been to revival meeting.
[time=3343] I said, "No, I'd like to go to one of those. Where do you go church?" He said, "I go to the assembly of God. I go to Pentecostal church." Now you have to understand, whenever church you've ever been in is dead in four o'clock, going to an assembly of God, Pentecostal revival meeting was one experience.
[time=3359] They had the Clough Indian family there, and that Clough Indian family played their guitars
[time=3366] and beat their tom-toms all over that platform.
[time=3369] I never heard anything like it. I was sitting on the back row and my eyes were bugging out.
[time=3374] They started that invitation and my buddy, praise God, was zealous for souls.
[time=3378] He leaned over me and said, "Do you want to go forward?" I said, "Let's go." And I went forward and I got back in the back room and they got me on my knees and they prayed I might get the gift of tongues.
[time=3387] Nobody ever told me how to get saved.
[time=3390] I was about ready to graduate from high school.
[time=3396] I was visiting a girlfriend.
[time=3402] All of a sudden, I said, "I've got to go home. I don't understand it, but I just got to go home." It was a Sunday night and I got down in my car and I started going home.
[time=3410] The next thing I knew, I'd drive in my car up in front of the Norwood Baptist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[time=3414] They preached the Bible. They believed in getting people saved.
[time=3418] Some young people in that church had been praying for me and I'd never been to church on a Sunday night in my life.
[time=3424] And I couldn't understand it. To this day, I can't understand it, but I got out of that car and walked down to the front of that church and sat down all by myself and heard the gospel that night and he gave the invitation.
[time=3434] I went forward and received Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and Jesus changed my life.
[time=3439] I got off of the broad road that was leading to hell.
[time=3442] I was concerned. I'd been doing something about it, but I'd done the wrong thing.
[time=3447] And I did the right thing. I took advantage of the crossroads and got on that narrow way that leads to life.
[time=3454] And my challenge to every one of you hearing this message today is to examine yourself to see if you'll be in the faith.
[time=3462] Broad is a way that leads to destruction and many there be which go in their act.
[time=3468] Straight as the gate to narrows the way and few there be that find it.
[time=3473] May you be one of those few by God's grace.
[time=3477] Would you bow with me in prayer, please?
[time=3484] [MUSIC]

[time=3514] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you pray with me right now?
[time=3524] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross from my sins.
[time=3531] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3537] I ask you to clean my heart up today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
