[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=112] And now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and
[time=122] soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=127] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=133] And for the Lord, I know that you are the world I am to be. I see the stars, I hear the growing come clear. I have throughout the new Christmas day.
[time=161] I sing to my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord. I sing to my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=191] And I shall come, we shall go back to nation, and take me home, what I shall build my heart. In I shall come, in the Lord and our nation, and then we'll bring it like our love, bring the Lord.
[time=216] I sing to my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord. I'll sing to my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=242] I'll bring the Lord.
[time=252] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=257] I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from whence come with my strength, my strength comes from the Lord, the maker of heaven and of earth.
[time=272] We've gathered this morning to lift up our eyes to the Lord, to lift up our voices in song, and to lift up our hearts in worship.
[time=280] We are so thankful that you've come to join us today in what we call a morning worship service, because we've gathered here today to do that above everything else, to bring worship and glory and honor to the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=296] We want to welcome you, and also welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour. We trust that God will use this service in each of your lives to draw you closer to Him.
[time=307] It's our sincere prayer that through our singing, our praying, and our studying of His Word, that each of us will take one more step in our spiritual life.
[time=316] People need the Lord. Those of us who know Christ to Savior need Him to guide us day by day. Those who've never heard Him need the voice of a missionary to tell them about Christ, because everywhere people need the Lord.
[time=333] Listen as our choir sings that song for us. People need the Lord.
