[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=30] (crickets chirping)
[time=90] (crickets chirping) - Amen.
[time=114] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=119] And now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=134] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=137] (singing in foreign language)
[time=227] (singing in foreign language) Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=236] What a privilege it is to join together in this Convocation Center and to worship as believers honoring the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=244] We're glad that you're here.
[time=246] It makes it much more enjoyable to stand up here and see the congregation here, worshiping with us, smiling back, and I trust that you're glad that you're in the house of the Lord today, and we give a special welcome to those that are joining us now through the Bible hour.
[time=260] We're glad that you're with us, and I trust the blessing of the Lord will be upon you as we worship together.
[time=267] Praise God in this sanctuary.
[time=269] That's what we intend to do today.
[time=271] Praise Him for His greatness.
[time=273] Praise Him for His mighty acts.
[time=275] Isn't it a joy to know that the Lord is blessing at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and we can praise Him for that?
[time=281] Also to know that He has done some great things individually in our lives, and we can worship corporately, and we can worship privately together individually as one body of believers.
[time=292] Let us continue praising the Lord as the choir sings a song now entitled, Come Christians, Join to Sing.
[time=315] Hallelujah, Amen.
[time=403] Praise Him for Christ again.
[time=414] Hallelujah, Amen.
[time=504] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=507] All praise goes to Him.
[time=508] Let's continue worshiping the Lord, so we turn to Him number 49.
[time=512] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together, Him number 49.
[time=519] Hallelujah, Amen.
[time=544] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name.
[time=549] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=554] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=564] Hallelujah, Amen.
[time=573] Blessed be the name, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=599] [MUSIC - 37 seconds]
[time=641] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=646] Our pastor Rick Hawks is away from us today.
[time=649] He's spending a couple of weeks visiting our missionaries around the world.
[time=654] I trust that when he comes back, he'll have some interesting comments to make concerning the ministries of our missionaries.
[time=660] Many of the people that he is visiting, our members of our church grew up in our church and were called to become missionaries.
[time=667] I think that's very important for us to know of their ministries on the field and to be aware so that we can pray more intelligently and we can give toward those ministries around the world.
[time=678] Let's remember Rick and Kathy in prayer as they are gone.
[time=681] I'd like to have you turn in your hymnals.
[time=684] Please do hymn number 187.
[time=687] We appreciate the ministry of Dave and Debbie Johnson as they perform on the violin and the viola.
[time=693] The song that they're going to play today is a familiar hymn, amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=701] Will you listen carefully to the melodious strings as they play and also be attentive to the text?
[time=706] Let's listen to the ministry now of Debbie and Dave as they play for us.
[time=718] (gentle music)
[time=883] Hello, and I hope this next few moments does not confuse you.
[time=888] We're recording this little message of an insert here today on March the 9th.
[time=895] And while you're watching this in Fort Wayne, it is March the 16th and while you're watching it in the South Bend and Marion, it is obviously two weeks even past then.
[time=904] But on March the 11th, Kathy and I will have left for Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines there to visit for the missionaries who are church supports.
[time=914] Many of them are actually from Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=917] And we hope to be going over there and learning a great deal from them and then also hopefully being an encouragement to them.
[time=925] Pete, I'm gonna miss you, but I know that you and the other men will carry things on here in a great way.
[time=930] Well, we're not anticipating you're going, but we are excited that you have the opportunity and that we have the opportunity then to hear of your reports.
[time=938] So we'll do our best to keep things going here in Fort Wayne as you travel.
[time=942] I'm sure that you'll keep things going just fine here, but try to make a few mistakes so people miss me and say we really need that guy.
[time=949] I don't think we'll even have to work at that.
[time=951] I don't know.
[time=952] But we wanna go to the mission field and learn and to share with people with the emphasis, of course, being on telling people how they can know Jesus Christ personally and become a Christian.
[time=964] You know, that's not only something that we do by way of missions across the ocean.
[time=968] That's the priority of the ministry of the Bible hour and of this church right here in Indiana.
[time=974] Pete, you have an excellent booklet on becoming a Christian.
[time=977] Yes, you're absolutely right, Rick.
[time=979] Our ministry here is to let you know that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world and died for yours in particular and that you can know him as a personal savior.
[time=988] And we'd like to offer a booklet to you entitled "Becoming a Christian." This booklet states the fact of why many people do not understand the word of God and what it means to become a Christian.
[time=999] And then it talks about the Christian way of knowing Jesus Christ as their personal savior, talks about the strong commitment that needs to be made to know Jesus Christ and then a prayer at the end that helps you understand for certain that you have Jesus Christ in your heart.
[time=1014] I think the booklet is very clear.
[time=1016] It's very simple and yet very important for your life because you do need to know that Jesus Christ died for you and you can know him and have eternal life.
[time=1025] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1036] Thank you, Pete, for sharing that booklet.
[time=1038] We do hope that you'll write today to receive your copy of "Becoming a Christian" by John R.W. Stott.
[time=1046] One of the reasons why I wanted to share this brief time with you even though we would be gone is to tell you about a letter that many of you will be receiving about the Founders Club, which is a very important part of the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=1061] Just before leaving, we took the time to write a letter explaining to you some of the needs of the Bible hour and how you can help by becoming a member of the Founders Club.
[time=1072] And if you would respond to that letter, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you.
[time=1077] If you're not on our mailing list and would like to know about the Founders Club, please take the initiative to write to us and we would be glad to include you.
[time=1085] During this time, we are evaluating the ministry as we do each year and asking for people to become partners with us through prayer and financial giving.
[time=1094] So when you receive your letter, please don't lay that aside like most of us do with the barrage of incoming mail, but take the time to read it and prayerfully consider what God would have you to do.
[time=1105] Well, I'm certainly going to miss being here at Blackhawk and with UP and we are looking forward to coming home and hearing how God is used, the men and women who are ministering while we're gone.
[time=1115] Thank you, Pete, for your leadership and you for joining us today.
[time=1118] - There are other announcements in the bulletin.
[time=1123] Please take it and use it as a reference point.
[time=1125] We're grateful for your support as you give faithfully to our church, not only because of our Sunday morning services, but of the training programs for our young people, for evangelism, and other events that take place.
[time=1137] We can only do that because of your faithful giving.
[time=1140] The ushers will come forward.
[time=1141] Now we'll plan to worship the Lord with our ties and offering.
[time=1145] I trust that you will consider this a part of our worship service this morning as you give faithfully unto Him.
[time=1151] Let us bow in prayer in one of our flock deacons, Bill Archer will lead us in prayer as we anticipate giving to the Lord.
[time=1160] Let's pray together.
[time=1161] Father, we come to your presence this morning with thankful hearts.
[time=1167] We have great privilege to be here.
[time=1169] We've gathered most of all to worship you, and we pray this morning as we bring these ties and offerings to you that you would bless them, that you would multiply them, that you would see fit to honor your name through these gifts.
[time=1184] Thank you for this privilege, Father.
[time=1185] We thank you in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1190] (gentle piano music)
[time=1347] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1352] Father, we're thankful that you can come to you.
[time=1357] We thank you for the death, the cross, and your said blood for our sins.
[time=1365] As we accept you and know you as a personal Savior, Lord, may our lives then be dedicated to you to live a life that would be pleasing and honoring to your name.
[time=1374] We thank you for the time that we can have together here, and we pray for Rick and Kathy as they are ministering to our missionaries, fellowshipping with them.
[time=1382] We pray that this will be a very profitable and good time for them.
[time=1385] Keep them in good health so they might enjoy their entire vacation and trip.
[time=1390] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1395] In the absence of our pastor, I'm pleased to announce to you that Dr. John Sproul is again with us.
[time=1400] He's been with us many times and we appreciate his ministry.
[time=1404] Dr. Sproul is in the Biblical Studies Division of Grace College in Seminary in Warsaw.
[time=1409] We're always happy.
[time=1410] When he comes back, he has a great message.
[time=1412] I trust that your hearts will be tuned to the Lord and to what Dr. Sproul has to say.
[time=1417] Dr. Sproul, we're glad you're here.
[time=1419] The Lord bless you as you speak to us.
[time=1421] Thank you, Peter.
[time=1430] Open your Bibles, please, to Hebrews, Chapter 10.
[time=1434] Hebrews, Chapter 10.
[time=1438] Back at Grace Seminary, when I get up to speak publicly,
[time=1451] my students' Bibles open automatically to Hebrews.
[time=1457] They have caught on to me.
[time=1462] Begin reading at verse 19 of Hebrews, Chapter 10.
[time=1468] "Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil that is to say his flesh.
[time=1480] And having a high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith, having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.
[time=1493] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
[time=1500] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching." Now, let's just pause for a moment for prayer.
[time=1521] Father, I pray again today for divine enablement to preach.
[time=1527] You are well aware of our frailty, our inabilities.
[time=1532] Enable us our Father, we pray, by God the Holy Spirit, to preach this message this morning.
[time=1540] We would pray our Father for the exaltation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1545] May God the Holy Spirit have complete charge of the service,
[time=1552] draw our eyes to him and to you.
[time=1556] We ask it our Father in the Savior's name.
[time=1560] [AMEN] There are many things about the epistle to the Hebrews that we do not know.
[time=1567] For example, we're not sure where these addresses lived, these Hebrew Christians who are being addressed in the epistle.
[time=1573] We think probably in Rome, but we're really not too sure, most likely at Rome.
[time=1579] We also do not know who wrote the epistle.
[time=1582] We can take a good guess at that by maybe claiming Paul, but we cannot really prove Pauline authorship of the epistle.
[time=1591] Some have tried to champion Luke, others have championed Barnabas and still others, Apollus.
[time=1598] A few ladies, by the way, a few have tried to champion Priscilla, but most likely Priscilla didn't do it.
[time=1606] The author refers to himself with a masculine, participle in Hebrews chapter 11, and so whoever he was, probably a man, but just for a moment this morning, I want you to use your imagination and imagine that you had had that great privilege,
[time=1621] that God has chosen you to write this great epistle.
[time=1625] And now you have come to the place in your writing where you have finished what we call today ten chapters, probably the greatest Christology ever written anywhere.
[time=1640] You have told your readers about Jesus Christ.
[time=1643] He is far greater than the prophets.
[time=1648] Jesus Christ is God's ultimate revelation.
[time=1651] He is God's Son.
[time=1653] He is God the Son.
[time=1655] He's the only Savior of men.
[time=1657] He's God's eternal heir.
[time=1659] He is the Creator God.
[time=1661] He is the one who is a perfect manifestation of deity, outward and inwardly.
[time=1666] He is very God of very God.
[time=1668] He is far greater than prophets.
[time=1670] Furthermore, you have written that he is far greater than the angels.
[time=1674] They serve the throne, he occupies the throne.
[time=1677] God the Father speaking of the Son, thy throne, O God, is forever and ever.
[time=1682] They are subservient.
[time=1685] They serve him, and they serve those who are heirs of salvation.
[time=1690] Furthermore, when our Lord comes back again to the inhabited earth, he will be ruling over all of that, and angels will worship him.
[time=1698] They are not in charge of that inhabited earth to come.
[time=1701] Only Christ is, and man in Christ under Christ.
[time=1705] Furthermore, you have written that he is far greater than Moses.
[time=1709] Moses indeed is a faithful servant inside the house of God, but Jesus Christ is God who is over the house.
[time=1716] He built the house, and by simple logic he is far greater than Moses.
[time=1721] Furthermore, he is greater than Aaron, or anyone found out of that old covenant priesthood.
[time=1726] He is a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
[time=1730] And you have written all of this.
[time=1733] Now you have come to the place in the epistle where you want to pause for a moment and set forth some practical exhortations.
[time=1743] What will be the very first thing you will think of?
[time=1746] What would you write in view of all of this great truth about the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=1754] Would you write, "Since all of this is true, we all ought to be involved in personal evangelism."
[time=1761] Would you write that?
[time=1763] That's a very important thing, by the way.
[time=1765] That's a matter of top priority, I believe, in the local church.
[time=1768] Would you write that?
[time=1770] Or maybe you will write something like this, now that all these things are true.
[time=1774] Make sure you are involved in world missions.
[time=1778] Would you write that?
[time=1780] That also, of course, is a matter of top priority for the local church.
[time=1788] In our text this morning, we have three exhortations.
[time=1794] They are easily identified with the little words, "Let us, let us, let us."
[time=1803] And I submit that these three things are paramount in the mind of the author of Hebrews,
[time=1809] and also paramount in the mind of God our Father.
[time=1814] We find the first one in verse 22, "Let us draw an air with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
[time=1820] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
[time=1826] The second one is in verse 23, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promises faithful." And then the third one, "And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works, by not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching." Three solemn exhortations.
[time=1853] The first one, of course, is that which is primary in God's mind.
[time=1858] It is the matter of worship, the matter of worship.
[time=1863] Worship is not something that is simply ancillary to the Christian faith.
[time=1868] Worship of God is fundamental.
[time=1871] It is the most elemental truth.
[time=1873] It is that which God wants us to be involved in all the time.
[time=1877] It is primary in God's mind.
[time=1880] It is the kind of worship without which the Christian life is cheap.
[time=1884] It is superficial, and it is barren.
[time=1887] It is true that our Lord Jesus Christ has saved us from the penalty of our sins.
[time=1891] That's absolutely true, and we thank God by the way for that.
[time=1896] It is also true that our Lord Jesus Christ has saved us from the power of our sins.
[time=1901] He's doing that every day as we allow Him to do that.
[time=1905] And one day He's going to come back again and remove us from this world, and we'll be saved from the presence of sin.
[time=1911] That's all very true, and it's mighty and glorious.
[time=1914] Thank God for it.
[time=1917] It is fundamentally true that God has saved us primarily for this matter of worship and adoration of Him.
[time=1927] And so the first thing on God's mind here is this matter of worship.
[time=1931] Let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of the.
[time=1935] That is always the divine priority.
[time=1938] Just for a moment, I want you to turn back to Mark chapter 3.
[time=1941] Mark chapter 3 in verse 14, where we have the divine priority established again
[time=1948] and stated plainly in Mark chapter 3 and verse 14.
[time=1957] Mark 3, 14.
[time=1968] This is the account of our Lord choosing His disciples.
[time=1972] Verse 13, "And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted, and they came to Him." Then He appointed twelve.
[time=1982] Now notice the little purpose clauses.
[time=1984] In order that they might be with Him.
[time=1987] And then in order that He might send them out to preach.
[time=1992] You see the sequence.
[time=1994] Always primary in God's mind is spending time with Him.
[time=1998] Spending time with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2001] Then you go out to minister.
[time=2003] Then you go out to preach.
[time=2004] Then you go out to teach your son is go class.
[time=2006] After you have spent time with Christ, it is absolutely necessary.
[time=2010] If I have one fear in standing up behind a pulpit.
[time=2015] It is the fear of not having spent enough time with Him.
[time=2019] And that what I say comes out as simply cold hard words.
[time=2023] I wouldn't like that at all.
[time=2026] You must spend time with Christ.
[time=2029] Years ago, Professor James Denny said it just right.
[time=2032] He said no man has a right to preach.
[time=2034] No man ought to preach.
[time=2036] Who cannot make great assertions about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2039] That by the way is very true.
[time=2041] I would simply add a little addendum to that.
[time=2044] No man ought to preach.
[time=2045] No man should preach.
[time=2047] Who cannot make great assertions about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2050] But it is also true that no man ought to preach.
[time=2053] And no man should preach.
[time=2055] Should try to preach.
[time=2056] Who cannot say that before I ever got up to preach I spent time with Jesus Christ.
[time=2061] It is absolutely necessary.
[time=2064] It is God's top priority that we worship Him and spend time with Him.
[time=2068] Let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith.
[time=2073] Let me ask this question.
[time=2075] How are we qualified to do that?
[time=2078] How are we qualified?
[time=2080] Our text gives us the answer.
[time=2081] Look at verse 20.
[time=2083] By a new and living way which He consecrated for us through the veil that is to say His flesh.
[time=2090] And then verse 21.
[time=2092] And having a high priest over the house of God.
[time=2094] Two qualifications.
[time=2097] God in Christ has opened the way wide open into His very presence.
[time=2101] That day when our Lord died upon that gory cross.
[time=2105] And He cried out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" At that moment God the Father tore the veil in the temple right into.
[time=2113] He ripped it down right down the middle and ripped it down.
[time=2117] No more barriers between the people of God and God.
[time=2121] No more coming in one man once a year into a small incense filled compartment.
[time=2126] When Jesus Christ died the death that brings death its death.
[time=2129] God pulled down all the barriers and now He invites us into His presence and to worship and enjoy Him.
[time=2134] All the barriers are pulled down.
[time=2136] Come on in Johnny's name, come on in and start enjoying me.
[time=2141] And so the first thing on God's mind is this matter of worship.
[time=2145] We have a new and living way which He has consecrated for us.
[time=2151] When I'm not out preaching I am in Warsaw, Indiana.
[time=2155] And I attend the very fine church in Warsaw.
[time=2159] Sometimes when I'm there in the church and I'm standing and we're singing songs or we're sitting down and the offering plate is passed by.
[time=2167] I sometimes wonder what in heaven's name are you doing John?
[time=2173] You can almost predict a worship service.
[time=2176] Opening song, opening prayer, announcements, another song.
[time=2182] Maybe a special number and then another song and then a speaker will get up to speak.
[time=2186] He will give later on an invocation or a benediction and we will all go back home again.
[time=2192] And we do that Sunday after Sunday after Sunday.
[time=2196] And sometimes I think we ought to stop and say what in heaven's name am I doing?
[time=2202] By the way what we do is a good way of worshiping.
[time=2206] But oftentimes we're not really into it.
[time=2210] For example singing some of the great songs of the faith.
[time=2215] "My Jesus I love thee, I know thou art mine, for thee all the follies of sin I resign."
[time=2224] Have you sung that?
[time=2226] Have you done that?
[time=2228] Or all to Jesus I surrender?
[time=2230] All to him I freely give.
[time=2232] Have you done that?
[time=2234] Oftentimes we're singing a lie aren't we?
[time=2238] Yes we are at times.
[time=2242] Another good way to worship by the way is with our giving.
[time=2246] And just as every song ought to be a love song to the Lord Jesus Christ, all that we give ought to be a love gift to him.
[time=2254] And it ought to be given that way, it belongs to him.
[time=2258] And when you give money it's like saying Lord here it is.
[time=2262] I love you and I want to give it in your name and for your sake and your glory.
[time=2268] And I've been trying now for a long time to cultivate those thoughts
[time=2274] and have that kind of attitude when I give money.
[time=2280] My wife is in the auditorium, she functions very well at times as my conscience.
[time=2288] I'm a little bit hard-headed though and stubborn.
[time=2292] And every now and then if we're sitting in a church and the usher's coming down the aisle with the plate,
[time=2298] if I have not yet reached into here when he's about two paces away, my wife will nudge me.
[time=2305] Now I hate to be nudged, I really do.
[time=2308] And if my wife nudges me I'll just clam up and I won't do anything.
[time=2312] I won't give a dime at that point.
[time=2316] I'll wait till that night and put it in at night.
[time=2320] I really am trying to develop an attitude that says Lord it's yours.
[time=2324] And I love to give it. I want to give it to you. I don't want to be nudged into it.
[time=2328] Now sometimes God has to nudge us, I understand that.
[time=2331] But we ought to develop an attitude of heart and mind that says Lord it's yours.
[time=2336] I love to give it. I want to sing a song to you.
[time=2340] Songs of praise adoring our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2344] That is paramount in God's mind.
[time=2348] That people stand up and praise him in Jesus' name.
[time=2352] Praise him for who he is and for what he has accomplished.
[time=2355] That's the first thing on God's mind.
[time=2357] It's the first thing on the mind of the author of Hebrews as he now comes to that practical section in the epistle.
[time=2363] Let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith.
[time=2367] Having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience in our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=2373] So we have a new and living way.
[time=2376] The Lord Jesus Christ has opened it wide open for you and me.
[time=2381] And by the way he did it with the shedding of his own blood.
[time=2387] Sometimes we don't like to say that you know.
[time=2391] We refer to it only maybe as the death of Christ.
[time=2395] And there are many scriptures that translate that way, death of Christ.
[time=2399] I understand that.
[time=2401] But he shed his own blood.
[time=2403] It was a blood-bought way into God's presence.
[time=2407] Never forget that.
[time=2409] A blood-bought way.
[time=2413] Several years ago in Longview, Texas I was preaching and a young man came up with all the wisdom of 18 years.
[time=2420] And tried to convince me that Christ could have died in a featherbed and still have been the redeemer.
[time=2425] I don't believe that.
[time=2427] I don't believe it for a moment.
[time=2430] He was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world.
[time=2433] That was God's appointed way, the shedding of blood.
[time=2436] And we ought not to be ashamed of that.
[time=2439] Several years ago in California, a woman lay dying in a hospital.
[time=2446] And she had a heavy burden of sin upon her heart.
[time=2450] And she was trying to get relief.
[time=2454] The hospital was operated by a church and into the room walked a nun who was serving as a nurse.
[time=2460] And the woman tried to unload that burden of sin upon the nun.
[time=2465] And the nun said, "Wait a minute. I'll go get the priest." And he will listen to your confession and he will absolve you of your sins.
[time=2472] And she left the room.
[time=2476] At that hospital that day was another woman walking from room to room.
[time=2481] And she had gospel tracks.
[time=2484] And she walked into that room and right away that woman tried to unload that burden of sin upon her.
[time=2489] Well she was ready and she told that dying woman about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2494] And his death upon the cross for her sins.
[time=2498] And that woman turned to Christ and was saved right then and there in that hospital room.
[time=2503] About that time the priest walked in.
[time=2506] He began to urge the lady to make a confession of her sins.
[time=2510] And he would absolve her of them.
[time=2514] She said, "Father show me your hands. Show me your hands."
[time=2520] He thought that her mind was wandering a little bit.
[time=2522] And again he urged her to make a good confession of sins.
[time=2525] And he would absolve her of them. Again she said, "Father show me your hands." Finally he reached his hand out and she took a hold of it and began to feel his hand.
[time=2536] And that's a little why she said, "Father it won't do. It just won't do." The only one who could forgive sins has nail prints in his hands and indeed he does.
[time=2546] He's the only savior of men.
[time=2548] You cannot get the God through any other way, only Christ.
[time=2552] He is the way, the truth, and the life. And only he can give life.
[time=2557] He has opened the way wide open in his own blood.
[time=2560] What a marvelous thought, you know.
[time=2562] Under the old covenant only one man, once a year the high priest could go back into that innermost compartment
[time=2568] in that smoke filled compartment. One man in God's presence.
[time=2572] Now in the death of Christ God has pulled down all those curtains.
[time=2576] The way is wide open into his presence in the person of Jesus Christ and he invites us in.
[time=2581] John is saying, "Don't linger back up all the old. We'll come back into my presence and start enjoying me." Let us draw near with a true heart and full assurance of faith.
[time=2590] Having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
[time=2596] My first qualification is a blood-bought way, verse 20.
[time=2599] Look at the second qualification, verse 21, "And having an high priest over the house of God." Not only has God opened the way in the blood of his son, but his son, our savior, our priest,
[time=2610] is right now in his presence.
[time=2613] So he says, "Don't linger out by the old. We'll come on in, John. Look who's by my side." His name is Jesus Christos Jesus Christ. He's your great high priest.
[time=2623] What a marvelous thought, folks. When you awoke this morning, he was praying for you.
[time=2630] If you belong to him, he was praying for you. He prays for you all the time.
[time=2637] A marvelous high priest.
[time=2641] One of my favorite Christians, he may now be with the Lord I haven't heard.
[time=2647] His name was Carl Armarding. He used to live in Dallas, Texas, and I heard him preach when he was up in his 90s.
[time=2656] Just to hear the man pray was a rich experience.
[time=2660] He said when he was a little boy, he attended a Plymouth Brethren Assembly, a very simple service.
[time=2666] No pastor, no preacher, just the elders leading in the service.
[time=2670] A very simple service in which they broke bread and had the Lord's table.
[time=2676] And Carl said when he was a little boy, he had a friend who was a member of the Roman Catholic Church.
[time=2683] They were good friends. He said, "One day my buddy asked me to attend church with him." And so I said, "Well, I'll go to church with you next Sunday if on the following Sunday you go with me to my church."
[time=2694] And so they struck a bargain.
[time=2696] On the Sunday that they had spoken of, Carl and his friend went to this huge cathedral.
[time=2704] It was a beautiful thing.
[time=2707] And the service was very stately and very, very nice.
[time=2714] And when Carl came back out, his buddy said, "Well, how'd you like our service?" Little Carl had to admit that it was really very impressive, very impressive.
[time=2725] On the next Sunday, Carl took his buddy with him to his little church and they observed that service.
[time=2731] And when they came back out, "Why?" little Carl said to his buddy, "Well, how'd you like our service?"
[time=2737] And then in his boyish grammar, the little boy said, "Well, I guess it's all right, but you folks ain't got no priest."
[time=2746] And little Carl made a beeline for his daddy, he said.
[time=2749] He said, "I went to my dad and I said, "Daddy, we don't have a priest." That was the wrong thing to say to his daddy.
[time=2755] He said his daddy put him on his knee and said, "Son, yes, we do have a priest." And little Carl said, "Well, daddy, what does he do for us?" His father said, "Son, he does a lot of things for us, but just one thing is this.
[time=2767] He prays for us all the time, all the time." And Carl said he made a beeline for his buddy and he said, "Yes, we do have a priest." He said his buddy asked him the same thing, he asked his father, he said, "Well, what does he do for you?" And little Carl said, "Well, he does a lot of things for us, but one thing is this, he prays for me all the time."
[time=2790] And Carl said he would never forget the look on that little boy's face.
[time=2794] His head dropped and he said, "Gee, I wish I had a priest who prayed for me all the time."
[time=2800] Friends we do, his name is Jesus Christ.
[time=2804] He has opened the way wide up into the presence of God the Father in his own blood.
[time=2808] And now he's there even this morning praying for this message, praying for folks like you.
[time=2813] He ever lives to make intercession for us.
[time=2816] We have a new and living way, a blood bought way, and furthermore we have a great high priest at God's right hand, two qualifications that qualify us to come into the presence of God the Father.
[time=2826] That's his first point.
[time=2827] Second point is in verse 23, "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised his faithful."
[time=2835] First point, worship.
[time=2839] Second point, perseverance in the faith.
[time=2843] Keep on with Jesus Christ.
[time=2845] These Hebrew Christians were beginning to drift.
[time=2848] He's trying to call them back to a steadfastness in Jesus Christ.
[time=2852] Hang on to Christ, don't let him go.
[time=2856] Keep on in the faith.
[time=2858] Even when it's so hard to do, even though you're being persecuted, keep on in the faith.
[time=2867] This may be the most important thing I could say this morning.
[time=2874] There will come a time in your life, whoever you might be,
[time=2880] when the way will get very dark and so hard to go on.
[time=2888] You need the truth of this verse.
[time=2892] Only Christ can sustain you, only Christ.
[time=2898] I can remember the day at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio,
[time=2906] a long time ago.
[time=2909] Neurosurgeon Bob McClaren came down the long corridor.
[time=2914] He came up to me and to my wife, Jenny, and he told us that our little daughter could not possibly live, that he had done all that he could, and he really had to save her life.
[time=2928] Born with spina bifida, my lemon ninja seal, she had had ten operations before she was one year of age, and now the new she cannot live.
[time=2940] He said, "Just take her on home.
[time=2942] She'll not live another month or two," and that's all he said.
[time=2948] We took her home and she lived to be almost six.
[time=2953] For about two years of that period, all that little darling could do was cry and cry and cry.
[time=2963] And mommy and daddy listened, day and night, and we used to pray, "Oh God, why don't you help us?"
[time=2974] One day I was banging my fist and saying, "God, why would you do that to a little Susan dorm?" My mom was there and she stopped me.
[time=2982] She said, "Son, that's not right and she was right." There comes a time when you have to hold on to God, regardless of what it seems like outside in all of the external circumstances.
[time=2995] However your life might be going, hang on to Christ.
[time=2998] And the author right here is saying, "When the hard times come, make sure you grab ahold of the promises and ahold of the promises and make the connection. He is faithful who promise, he is always faithful, always."
[time=3015] With you it might not be a child, it might be a busted marriage,
[time=3026] it might be financial, seemingly all hope gone.
[time=3033] It might be a matter of personal illness and you pray and you pray.
[time=3039] And still it's there.
[time=3043] You need a layhold of Christ and hang on to Him.
[time=3047] Make the connection between the one who made the promises and the one who promised them.
[time=3051] Every promise of God is ye and our men in Jesus Christ, every promise.
[time=3056] Thank God for that.
[time=3059] So that's his second point. Hang on to Jesus Christ.
[time=3064] Then his third point, verse 24, "And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works by not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some,
[time=3079] but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching."
[time=3085] Duty number one, worship number two, continuous in the faith.
[time=3094] Keep on with Christ. Don't abandon Him.
[time=3099] The one who made the promises is faithful and indeed He is.
[time=3104] Third point, consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works.
[time=3112] Now we know how we usually punctuate that, don't we?
[time=3115] Consider one another to provoke, period.
[time=3120] We can do that rather easily, can we not?
[time=3123] To provoke unto jealousy or backbiting, church squabbles?
[time=3129] But we're to consider one another to provoke unto love and the good works.
[time=3135] In other words, when the author wrote that statement, he was saying something like this, he was the first victim.
[time=3142] You cannot say, "Oh, I belong to Christ." If you cannot say at the same time, "I also belong unto all those who genuinely love Him, all of them,
[time=3155] who genuinely love the Lord Jesus Christ." When I was a young man, 13 years of age, I was saved in a small mountain community in southeastern Kentucky.
[time=3169] Through the ministry of a very old mountain assembly, a little wooden church house, where maybe 30 or 40 people met during the week,
[time=3180] and during one of the services, I was saved.
[time=3185] They wanted me to pray through.
[time=3188] They were Pentecostal in their beliefs, and so I felt like I ought to pray.
[time=3195] And so I prayed for about an hour one night with them, and they prayed along, and nothing happened.
[time=3201] Finally, they stopped praying and left, and I stopped praying and left also.
[time=3207] But you know, when I go back to that little village even today, and I go to one of their houses, they treat me as though my name were Ronald Reagan.
[time=3216] They really do. They open up the door, and all they hug me, and they squeeze me, and we come in, and usually a meal will be prepared, and we eat and enjoy each other's company, and then we can go into the front room and we pray, and we all pray together.
[time=3232] I have never embraced some of their doctrines, but friends, I will always love them, always.
[time=3240] You cannot say, "I have been drawn to Christ, and not at the same time be drawn to all those who really love Him."
[time=3249] It's so important.
[time=3252] Now, some folks in the church, it is very easy to love.
[time=3256] You can love the lovely, can you not?
[time=3259] And those who are always doing nice things for you.
[time=3262] There are a lot of lovely Christians, by the way, in the church, and thank God for them.
[time=3267] But every now and then, you know, you run into one that when you're first medium, all you want to do is sort of pop Him in the nose.
[time=3274] He's not very lovely at all, and we've all met folks like that, and maybe folks have looked at us like that, you know?
[time=3283] And I've had people like that that you have to sort of hold your tongue.
[time=3289] Years ago in Dallas, the way Elmer Johnson is in the audience today, and he was also there when J. Vernon McGee was teaching us Romans in English Bible classes.
[time=3300] He made a statement one day that I have never forgotten, and it was like this.
[time=3305] All of us, all of us, all of the go-around with a big sign in our back that reads, "This is not the best that the grace of God can do." And if we did that, we would not be so quick to judge our brothers and sisters in the war, because when I'm doing that, and I'm out of sorts with a brother or sister, that simply testimony to the fact that the love of Christ has not been shed abroad in my own heart, because you see Christ loves us in spite of what we are.
[time=3334] He loves us eternally, and indeed he does.
[time=3340] So that last exhortation, "Draw near to Christ." Furthermore, keep on meeting together and exhort one another, build each other up in the faith.
[time=3350] Every time you meet in assembly like this, somewhere during this meeting, you ought to be able to build someone up or say something nice to a friend in an encouraging word.
[time=3359] To one another.
[time=3363] It is especially true by the way concerning our older folks, which we have tended to neglect a little bit in a lot of churches.
[time=3371] And some of our older folks feel like they're sort of useless, you know, and not part of the activity of the church.
[time=3379] People who are 80 or 90.
[time=3382] Maybe they've been walking with the Lord for 50 years, and we sort of shove them off to the side a little bit.
[time=3388] We ought not to do that.
[time=3390] There are most valuable members walking with God 50 years.
[time=3396] What we can learn from them if we would develop that.
[time=3402] Years ago, Peter Pell, who used to preach out of Michigan, told the story of a friend of his that he had back in either Lansing or maybe Grand Rapids.
[time=3410] She was 92 years of age, and Peter used to tell the story about everywhere he would go preaching.
[time=3417] He would remember the folks back home, and at night he would be praying, and he would pray, "Oh, oh, Father, why don't you take her home?"
[time=3424] She is 92. She has served you for 50 years. Why don't you just take her on home?
[time=3428] She's ready to go. Just take her on up the glory. Why don't you take her home, Father? Please take her home."
[time=3434] He went back one day to Lansing or Grand Rapids, and was talking with that lady, and she said, "You know, Peter, I pray for you all the time."
[time=3444] Oh, Peter said he changed his prayer right away. "Lord, keep her here. Keep her here, Lord. Keep her here."
[time=3451] What a difference it makes. If I knew, and by the way, I think I do, of even five people who were praying for me right now,
[time=3462] what a difference it would make. It makes a difference.
[time=3466] So we ought to come together with the idea of edifying one another and building each other up in the faith.
[time=3474] Day by day encouragement, we need each other friends.
[time=3480] The body of Christ, building each other up, edifying each other.
[time=3487] Three solemn exhortations.
[time=3506] You've been listening to our musicians, Dave and Debbie Johnson, minister to you in the absence of our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3513] The best speaker today was Dr. John Swall. If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning knowing Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,
[time=3522] I'd like to take a moment and pray with you right now. Please pray with me.
[time=3527] Dear Heavenly Father, I've thought through, and I've asked you for direction in knowing Jesus Christ's personal Savior.
[time=3536] And today I want to ask you to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me and to come into my heart today.
[time=3543] I ask you to come in, in Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3549] We are always pleased when we hear of decisions that are made.
[time=3552] When you make a decision to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, would you write us a note and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3559] Then when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your walk with God.
