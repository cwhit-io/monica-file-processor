[time=116] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=119] Now, from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=134] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=138] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=157] Would you lift your voices on the chorus one more time?
[time=160] Just put your books away and join in singing How Great Thou Art Then Sings My Soul.
[time=166] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=202] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=205] Certainly as a testimony to our Lord and to our community as we sing that way, that we love the Lord, we believe He's a great and merciful God.
[time=215] We welcome you to our service today, we're glad that you're here with us.
[time=219] Our Pastor Rick Hawks is away from us again this Sunday.
[time=222] He'll be returning back to Fort Wayne on Thursday and we'll be back with us in our worship services next Sunday morning.
[time=229] Rick has had a very eventful trip visiting our missionaries in Hong Kong and he's in the Philippines today.
[time=235] This is a great time for him to renew friendships with our missionaries that we support at Black Hawk
[time=241] and become more aware of the ministries that they have around the world.
[time=245] We're looking forward to his return not only for his preaching but for the information that he has for us
[time=251] concerning the trip that he just most recently took.
[time=254] We're glad to welcome those of you that are watching us on the Bible Hour.
[time=258] We're glad that you're with us, trust that this meeting will be a blessing to you.
[time=262] The Scripture says in Matthew 21, "And the disciples brought the donkey and the colt and laid them on their garments on which he sat, and most of the multitudes spread their garments in the road.
[time=273] And others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.
[time=277] And the multitudes going before him and those who followed after were crying out saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David, bless it is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest." And when he had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred saying, "Who is this?" And the multitudes were saying, "This is the Prophet, Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.
[time=301] Hosanna, bless it is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."

[time=628] It's great to have a congregation that sings praises to the Lord with that kind of enthusiasm.
[time=634] We're going to continue now with our ministry of music as Kevin, Ro, and Denise Mitchell come to sing.
[time=640] Let's listen to the ministry that they have for us as they sing for us.

[time=881] Hello, this is the point in the program where we take a moment from our regular service
[time=895] and talk with you that are viewing us by way of television.
[time=898] You will notice that our pastor Rick Hawks is gone.
[time=901] We anticipate him coming back this week.
[time=903] Rick has been on a missionary trip to Hong Kong and presently today he's in the Philippines.
[time=908] He's visited many of the missionaries that we support here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and we're looking forward to his return this week as he comes and tells us of the ministries of our missionaries
[time=919] that we support on a regular basis.
[time=922] While he's gone and during the time that he was here in the last couple weeks, we've asked you viewers to write to us and tell us about the program and the response that you have concerning our ministry.
[time=933] And we've got a lot of letters that were just really refreshing to us and encouraging.
[time=937] I'd like to take a moment right now and just read a couple to you.
[time=941] This one says Dear Reverend Hawks, I have had the wonderful opportunity to view your Bible hour.
[time=947] I was helped so much by your talk on divorce.
[time=950] I have been learning about the importance of being able to forgive and I would like you to please send me your book on forgiveness.
[time=956] May God bless you and your wonderful telecast.
[time=959] I will be a regular viewer.
[time=962] And here's another one that says I recently watched your telecast on TV 46 South Bend about being single.
[time=969] After watching this program, my spirit was lifted.
[time=972] I always had thought that there was something wrong with being single and that one had to be married just because everyone else was.
[time=979] One day I will marry, but for now I am going to enjoy being single.
[time=983] Please send me the book on singleness.
[time=987] This one says Dear Pastor Hawks, it was so good to hear from you and your staff.
[time=992] Your program, The Bible Hour, helps a lot of shut-ins.
[time=995] And I have some shut-ins in my family.
[time=997] We thank you very much for it.
[time=999] This one was a letter written from prison.
[time=1002] It says Dear Folk with the Bible Hour.
[time=1005] To be frank, I am not in the habit of watching religious programs.
[time=1009] This is subject to change.
[time=1011] I switched channels this morning and came across the one you are on and caught a brief portion of the pleasing fellow that gave the message.
[time=1019] His words were full of encouragement and explanation.
[time=1022] I hope to hear or watch him again as I found his way with words exceptional.
[time=1027] While these are some of the letters that we received and we had asked you to write into us just to give us some encouragement that you are there.
[time=1034] Our ministry on other channels is very important and we need to hear from you concerning you watching the program.
[time=1040] And I hope it's a blessing to you.
[time=1042] We've offered through the letters you've noticed that we've offered some booklets and today we have a booklet that's entitled Becoming a Christian.
[time=1050] There are hundreds of people that reject Christianity simply because they're unaware of it.
[time=1055] And there are hundreds more that would like to become Christians but no one is there to tell them.
[time=1059] We'd like to explain to you through a booklet entitled Becoming a Christian how you can know through the scriptures what it means to know Jesus Christ in a person away.
[time=1069] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1080] That's the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1084] Zip code is 46815. The booklet by John Stott is a real encouragement.
[time=1090] It's very clear and concise and I trust that you will write in today for this helpful booklet.
[time=1095] We're going to go back to our regular program now.
[time=1098] I hope that you'll stay with us for the music and then the message from our special guest, the field director of the Association of Evangelists, Russ Eversal.
[time=1108] Join us now for our program.
[time=1114] [MUSIC - 199 seconds]
[time=1339] The title of that song is Lonely Voices.
[time=1343] I'm sure you're aware that you pass people every day and you can see it in their eyes that they have nothing there, there's an emptiness.
[time=1350] I trust that as we walk by people that we are aware that we have Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and they can know Him too.
[time=1357] There are hundreds around the world that are ignorant of Christianity, they're just totally unaware of it.
[time=1362] There are others that would like to become Christians, but they don't know how.
[time=1366] May we be in that right spot at the right time to tell others about Jesus Christ.
[time=1370] Our special guest today is Russ Eversal.
[time=1373] Russ Eversal is the field director for the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism.
[time=1378] He's going to speak to us this morning and then this evening.
[time=1381] I trust that you will listen carefully to what he has to say and his challenge about missions.
[time=1386] Before he comes to speak to us, let's listen to the quartet as they sing a song.
[time=1391] It's entitled "My house is full, but my field is empty." Listen to the message that has for us and be challenged.
[time=1399] We have a responsibility whether it's here or to go abroad to tell the world they need a Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1421] There is peace and contentment in my Father's house today.
[time=1450] Lots of food on his table and no one is turned away.
[time=1460] There is singing and laughter as the hours pass by.
[time=1470] What a rush comes to singing as the Father sadly cries.
[time=1481] My house is full, but my field is empty.
[time=1492] Who will know and work for me today?
[time=1502] It seems my children all want to stay around my table,
[time=1511] but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1536] Push away from the table, look out through the window pane.
[time=1551] He lies a field of golden rain and its white unto harvest, but the rivers where are they in the house.
[time=1568] O can't the children hear the Father sadly say?
[time=1579] My house is full, but my field is empty.
[time=1589] Who will know and work for me today?
[time=1598] It seems my children all want to stay around my table,
[time=1607] but no one wants to work in my field.
[time=1655] Thank You what a challenging word of music this morning.
[time=1660] And the burden of our hearts today on this special mission Sunday is that the Lord of the Harvest may challenge men and women and young people
[time=1672] into the vast harvest fields of the world.
[time=1675] The one thing the Lord Jesus Christ told us to do about this lack of harvesters was to pray.
[time=1682] And that's the one thing I'm afraid most of us as Christians fail to do.
[time=1687] And so I trust that God might challenge your hearts on this Lord's day to pray day by day that God, the Spirit, will challenge and call and thrust forth men and women
[time=1702] into His harvest fields here in this city, this state, this nation, but to the ends of the world.
[time=1712] Back in 1975 in the Chittagang hill tracks of Bangladesh, an event happened that was to change radically the life of a young prince of one of the tribes there,
[time=1728] a man by the name of Dupriya Roy.
[time=1732] His cousin was the king of the Chakma tribe, the largest tribe in the Chittagang hill tracks in Bangladesh.
[time=1741] He was a young man who had everything he really needed and wanted.
[time=1746] In fact, his parents who were able to do that had recently purchased a very fast and fancy motorcycle for him.
[time=1757] And one day with a friend of his on the back, he was cruising down one of the hills there near his town of Rangamati
[time=1766] in the Chittagang hill tracks of Bangladesh when suddenly an old man came walking out into his pathway.
[time=1774] He swerved to avoid hitting this old gentleman and had a very, very serious accident.
[time=1783] He was paralyzed. His parents took him to the large city hospital in Chittagang,
[time=1790] and there he lay for almost a month, and not much was being done for him at all.
[time=1796] And then his relatives heard of a Christian hospital in Malamgut, some 60 miles south of Chittagang,
[time=1805] and they put him in a vehicle and brought him down to our hospital, the Memorial Christian Hospital there.
[time=1811] And there began literally months of tender, loving care for this young prince, Dupree Arroy.
[time=1821] And while he was getting the TLC physically, he was also hearing day by day the wonderful story of God's love for him.
[time=1832] I wish I could say this morning, some 11 years later, that this fine, handsome, tribal prince was able to walk.
[time=1842] He was able to walk, but I can't say that.
[time=1845] He has since that accident been confined to a wheelchair.
[time=1849] But I'm happy to say this morning that God used that incident to challenge this young man to capture his attention
[time=1860] so that initially he might come in contact for the very first time with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1868] Some months after he had been in the hospital, Dr. Vic Olson came in one morning, and he and other doctors and nurses
[time=1876] had been sharing the wonderful story of the gospel of Jesus Christ with this tribal man.
[time=1883] And he said to the doctor, "Sir, I would like to receive Jesus Christ as my Savior today."
[time=1891] And our doctor had the joy of leading him to Jesus Christ.
[time=1897] His life was transformed.
[time=1901] A few months later, after studying the Word of God faithfully with our men and women there, he asked if he might be baptized.
[time=1912] And the local river.
[time=1915] And he was baptized in a wheelchair.
[time=1918] Since that time, he's gone back to his town in the hill tracks.
[time=1922] Rangamati, he has married a Christian girl.
[time=1925] And today, he is serving the Lord Jesus Christ there by helping to translate the New Testament into the Chachma dialect.
[time=1935] Several hundreds of thousands of Chachma tribal people there, the Word of God, never been translated into their dialect.
[time=1944] And Dupriaroy this morning today is there in his hometown translating God's Word for his own people.
[time=1953] You see, God had a wonderful plan for Dupriaroy.
[time=1958] And part of that plan was that he might come to know Jesus Christ as his Savior.
[time=1964] And God loves every one of you here this morning.
[time=1967] God loves every one of you out there in TV land.
[time=1971] Jesus Christ came many hundreds of years ago so that he might give his precious life, a sinless life for your sins and my sins on the cross of Calvary.
[time=1984] This coming Friday, we will remember in a very special way God's love as he sent Jesus to give himself for us.
[time=1993] And God wants to capture your attention if you don't know his son as your Savior.
[time=1998] He wants you to know that he loves you with an everlasting love.
[time=2003] And that whosoever comes to the Lord Jesus Christ, repenting of his or her sins, confessing them to Jesus and believing that Jesus died for you on the cross of Calvary.
[time=2015] You too may come into a wonderful personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and he'll transform your life as he did Dupriaroy.
[time=2024] And you will become a new creature in Christ and all things will be passed away and all things will become new.
[time=2031] And then God will lead you step by step and day by day into a knowledge of his wonderful will for your life.
[time=2039] You see, God wants to capture your attention this morning, and I'd like you to turn in your Bibles to Exodus chapter 3 where we see the Spirit of God working in a wonderful, wonderful way to capture the attention of one of his servants, Moses.
[time=2055] For he had a ministry, he had a purpose and a plan for this man's life.
[time=2063] God has a purpose and plan for your life this morning too. And I trust that you will allow him by his word and by his Spirit to capture your attention.
[time=2073] And God used a very unusual way and thing to capture Moses' attention, verse 2 of chapter 3 of Exodus and the angel of the Lord appeared on him in a flame of fire out of the mist of a bush.
[time=2085] And he looked and behold, the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside.
[time=2093] I'm going to see what's going on here. I've never seen anything like this before, and so he stepped off his path and turned aside to see this great sight why the bush is not burned.
[time=2105] And when the Lord saw that Moses had stopped on his way and stepped aside to see, God called him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses, and he said, here am I.
[time=2117] Now God does not use burning bushes that are not consumed today to capture the attention of men and women and young people.
[time=2127] God does use his precious word, and God does use experiences and incidents in your life and mine to bring us up short to stop us from our headlong race down our particular path of life in order that we might listen to him.
[time=2146] In order that we might initially come to him for salvation, in order that we might understand his love and the wonderful plan and purpose he has for us.
[time=2157] And I trust this morning and throughout this day of missions emphasis that you will permit and allow the Spirit of God to speak to your heart to lead and direct you into that which is his will for you.
[time=2171] Now we will not take time this morning to read through the first 10 or 11 verses of Exodus, but suffice it to say that God explained to Moses that he was going to lead his people out of bondage in Egypt,
[time=2186] that he cared for them, that he saw their needs, that he heard their cry, that he knew all about them, and he was to come down to deliver them.
[time=2195] And then we go down to verse 10, "Come now therefore, and I will send you unto Pharaoh, Moses, that you may bring forth my children, my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt."
[time=2206] And Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh?"
[time=2213] And you know God, as he speaks to some of our hearts, he gets the same response, "Lord, who am I? I couldn't do that. I can't be that. No Lord. You've got the wrong follow. You've got the wrong girl."
[time=2225] But he didn't. He wanted Moses.
[time=2229] And we turn over to chapter 4, the first two, three verses, and I find a very interesting divine question, a question that God posed to Moses.
[time=2238] You know, it's an interesting study in the Word of God to go through the questions that God asked men and women.
[time=2245] The first question God asked was of Adam, "Where are you, Adam?"
[time=2251] Well, God knew where he was, but he wanted to get Adam's attention.
[time=2255] He wanted Adam to understand, in a very dramatic way, that he was far from God because of his sin. That was the first question.
[time=2265] But here in chapter 4, we read in verse 1, Moses answered and said, "Behold, God, they'll not believe me. They'll not harken in my voice. They'll say the Lord hath not appeared unto you."
[time=2278] And the Lord said unto Adam, "Here's this question. What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A rot." And the Lord said, "Throw it on the ground." And he threw it on the ground. It became a serpent, venomous snake.
[time=2291] Moses fled from it. The Lord said unto Moses, "Put forth your hand. Take it by the tail." Hey, you don't pick poisonous snakes up by the tail?
[time=2301] Have ever? Any of you ever tried that?
[time=2305] You said, "I don't get within 40 miles of a venomous snake if I can help it." But you don't pick them up by the tail.
[time=2312] I have seen in Bangkok, Thailand on a snake farm there how the snake keeper goes into the pit with those poisonous vipers, cobras and others.
[time=2321] And he picks out the snake that he wants to milk to get the venom from.
[time=2325] And almost like lightning, he throws his stick down there with a fork down and he puts it right behind the head of the snake and pulls him out of all of those serpents.
[time=2334] And then quickly he picks that snake up by the back of the head.
[time=2338] He never, never goes for the tail. That'd be the last snake he picked up.
[time=2345] But God said, "Pick that snake up by the tail." And Moses did.
[time=2352] You see, God was testing Moses' obedience and he didn't fail the test.
[time=2359] And the snake became a rod.
[time=2365] And God said, "Moses, what do you have in your hand?" Now this morning, dear friends here and out there in TV Land, I want to have you think with me quickly and briefly of three implications of that question of God.
[time=2383] What do you have in your hand?
[time=2384] First of all, that implies availability.
[time=2388] Moses, what do you have in your hand? And Moses said, "A stick, a shepherd's rod, just a dirty old piece of wood."
[time=2398] And God said, "I want it. Give it to me, Moses. Make it available to me. I want it."
[time=2406] You know, God is saying to many of you here and out there in your homes this morning, "What do you have?"
[time=2413] And honestly, you reply, "Lord, if you only know what I have, I have troubles. I have heartaches. I am burdened with sin."
[time=2423] And Jesus Christ says, "In effect, let me have them. Come unto me, all you that are weary and heavy laden, and I'll give you rest."
[time=2434] And oh, if that's your need this morning, if you're here out there and you are burdened heavily by your sin, you don't know which way to turn.
[time=2445] You think of death and it scares you to death. You wonder what eternity will bring, and you're there this morning.
[time=2453] In all of that, God says, "What do you have?"
[time=2459] You say, "This is all." And He said, "Let me have it. Let me take it. Cast your burdens upon me, and I'll give you rest."
[time=2469] And for you who are believers in Jesus Christ this morning, God says to you and asks you, "What do you have in your hand this morning?"
[time=2478] And you may honestly reply, "I don't have much, Lord. You know, I don't have a lot on the ball. Oh, I can't do this and that."
[time=2485] And God said, "Listen, let me have you. Give me what you have. Give me what you are. That's all I'm expecting. That's all I'm asking for. That's all I'm demanding."
[time=2499] You know, years ago when our family was in the Philippines, you see, I've had the great privilege of being married to two wonderful, wonderful ladies at different times.
[time=2513] And my first wife and I and little boy went to the Philippines in 1954, and we had the great privilege and joy of serving Christ there for ten years together in evangelism and church planning.
[time=2524] And during the middle of those years, my wife became ill with cancer. And then during our third term, just there, 13 months, the cancer recurred, and I had to bring her back to this country in 1964, and she went to be with the Lord shortly after that time.
[time=2542] And then a few years later, four, four and a half years later, God wonderfully led into my life, a widow, from Indiana. And so, you know, I'm partial to the Hoosier state.
[time=2554] But I'm not so happy about this Hoosier hysteria. And I'll tell you why. I was in my motel last night, and there were signs all over the doors up and down that hallway about marrying.
[time=2571] I think the whole town of Marion was in the same motel with me last night. And I hope you're not from Marion, but I kind of wish the other team had won because it was so noisy last night.
[time=2586] But I do have a special place in my heart for Indiana because my wife Nancy comes from Mentone, Indiana, and we've served the Lord together with our eight children, didn't that something?
[time=2600] I have five, she had three, even with a new math, I think it still makes eight. And eight is enough.
[time=2609] But we had the joy of serving the Lord and the Philippines together. But years ago, I recall Jean, my first wife and I, living in the city of a colon, one day, a very fine young fellow, about 16, 17 years old, came to our home.
[time=2625] And he said to my wife, "Mom, I got a problem." She said, "What's your problem, Artie?" He said, "Well, my problem is this. The president of our youth group is going to Manila in a few months to study at the university."
[time=2637] She said, "What's your problem?" And he said, "My problem is this. Did you forget I'm the vice president? Oh, well, wonderful. Then you become the president, don't you? That's my problem."
[time=2648] He said, "I could never be a president. I could never stand in front of that large group of young people. I could never do that."
[time=2655] And my wife said to Mart, "If God is giving you the privilege of serving him as president, all he wants is for you to make yourself available to him." And he did.
[time=2667] He became a great president. Year and a half or so later, he came to our home again to see my wife, never came to see me, always my wife.
[time=2674] And he said, "Mom, you'll never guess what's happened." She said, "What's happened, Art?" He said, "I believe God's calling me to preach."
[time=2682] Oh, she said, "That's thrilling because I've been praying to that end." He said, "But I could never preach." He said, "Can you picture me before people preaching?" He said, "I couldn't do it."
[time=2692] And he said, "Furthermore, I don't have any money. You go to seminary." And my wife said, "Art, if God is giving you the privilege of going into the ministry to preach the gospel, all he wants is your availability. Just let him have yourself." And he did.
[time=2707] And you know, God was so good because four or five years later, shortly before Gene went to be with the Lord, we were in Manila. We were leaving shortly to come back.
[time=2717] And we attended the graduation at our seminary, and Art graduated as valedictorian of his class. My wife was so pleased, so thankful.
[time=2726] And he was called to be a part-time professor, teacher at the school. Then we had to come home. I was back here for four or five years, and then Nancy and I went back to the Philippines.
[time=2738] And one day we went to the Manila International Airport to see a young couple and a little baby boy off for missionary service in Thailand. You know it was? Art.
[time=2748] And he went to Thailand. He's been there now for about 12 or 15 years, working up near the Laos border, not very difficult, dangerous place.
[time=2756] About five years ago, I was in Washington, D.C., preaching at the Washington Bible College, and a man came up after the service. He said, "Do you know a man by the name of Art Inion?" And Thailand, I said, "Do I know? I'm sure."
[time=2769] He said, "Well, I work about three hours from him. He's one of the finest missionaries I've ever met." And my mind went back quickly, years before, when this young, shy, Filipino teenager came to our home, and he said, "Mom, I've got a problem."
[time=2790] And all God wanted was his availability. He said, "What do you have, Art?" He said, "Don't have much. Let me have it."
[time=2799] I listened to a young fellow here today, a young girl, old person here. If you belong to Jesus Christ, he's got a purpose and a plan and a wonderful ministry for you too.
[time=2808] And all he wants is for you to say honestly with no strings attached, no reservations, Lord. Here I am. I'm available.
[time=2816] I'm available. What do you have in your hand, Moses? Just a rod. Great. Let me have it. I'm going to perform miracles for you if you make it available.
[time=2831] There's a second implication though, that question in chapter 4 of Exodus 1, "What do you have in your hand?" Not only does it imply availability, but it implies adequacy.
[time=2842] For God says, "Moses, what do you have?" And he said, "Not much. I just got this stick." And God said, "That's enough. Let me have it."
[time=2852] You see, over in chapter 3, verse 10, look at that again with me, verse 11, "Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I should go into Pharaoh?"
[time=2862] Now that was the wrong question, Moses. Never should have asked that. And you shouldn't ask yourself the question when God probes your heart.
[time=2869] When God says, "I want your attention. I've got something I want to share with you. I want you to become involved in my program and my plan for world evangelization."
[time=2880] You should never say to God, "Who am I? He knows who you are. He made you." You should say, "Oh God, how great thou art." You see, in verse 6 of chapter 3, read, God said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.
[time=2900] I am the great I am. I am the creator of the universe. I am the one that sustains everything. I am the one that created you."
[time=2909] I am the one calling you to myself and to my service.
[time=2913] That great I am, said to Moses in verse 7, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt."
[time=2920] Isn't that tremendous that the God of the universe sees you in your need?
[time=2925] The God who created you, here's your cry, verse 7.
[time=2930] The God who created you knows your sorrows and he's come down to deliver you.
[time=2938] And so Moses never should have said, "Who am I?" He should have said, "Lord, you want me to serve you? How wonderful! Not because I am capable myself, but because you are completely adequate for anything you ask me to do."
[time=2958] Do you think God has a sense of humor, folks?
[time=2962] Hm. He does?
[time=2965] Oh, is that luck out upon your faces? Gotta get my glasses on so I can see you're real good.
[time=2970] Yes, God has a sense of humor.
[time=2976] And as you look at me, you say, "Yes, God has a sense of humor."
[time=2982] Right? He does. And I know he has a sense of humor because he said something here to Moses, "What do you have in your hand?"
[time=2990] He said, "I just have a shepherd's stick, a shepherd's rod." And you know, over in Genesis you need not turn to it this morning, but over in Genesis chapter 46 and verse 34 we read this.
[time=3001] "Every shepherd has an abomination to the Egyptians." Do you understand what that means?
[time=3007] God is saying to Moses, "Let me have that stick, that shepherd's crook, and I want you to go into the palace of Pharaoh, the greatest, most powerful ruler of his day.
[time=3017] I want you to go up before his throne, and I want you to hold that rod in your hand and say to Pharaoh, "Let my people go."
[time=3028] And every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians. God was going to use the very symbol that the Egyptians thought was shameful to lead his people out of Egypt.
[time=3044] You know why? Because God wants to get the glory. First Corinthians 1, he doesn't call many mighty, he doesn't call many wealthy, he doesn't call many famous, why?
[time=3055] So that everybody will know that it's God doing the work, and he'll get the glory.
[time=3062] And dear friends, this morning God wants to involve you in his program of missions around the world.
[time=3069] And he asked, "What do you have in your hand?" And you said, "I don't have much. You may be an older lady, an older man here, and you say, "I don't have much. I'm kind of weak physically."
[time=3078] Listen, you have time in your hand. You can pray. And Jesus said one thing. The laborers are few. The harvest is great. Pray.
[time=3093] Wouldn't it be wonderful if in this church and throughout this area of Indiana, retired men and women who are not physically able to go to a field or perhaps even get out of your bedroom?
[time=3104] Would covenant before God this morning, "Oh God, help me!" To pray earnestly that your thrust forth labor is in your harvest field. You can do that.
[time=3116] What do you have in your hand this morning? Whatever it is, make it available. It will be adequate. Look at chapter 4 and verse 2, a very interesting thing.
[time=3126] The Lord said unto Moses, "What do you have in your hand?" He said, "A-Rod, just any O-Rod." Now look quickly at chapter 4 and verse 17.
[time=3134] "Thou shall take what?" This rod in your hand, wherewith thou shall do sign. A-Rod, just any O-Rod, you ask, but it's a particular rod that God's going to use.
[time=3146] You might say, "I'm just any O person." Yeah, but you're a particular special person to God. Now look at verse 20, please, in chapter 4.
[time=3157] And Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took what? Not A-Rod, not this rod, but the rod of God in his hand.
[time=3168] And dear people, God wants you to become his rod, his instrument, his implement to accomplish his purposes.
[time=3177] You're not adequate, but he is. One more thing. This implies this question not only availability and adequacy, but it implies accountability.
[time=3189] He said to Moses, "What do you have in your hand, Moses? You better use it because you're going to be accountable to me for how you used what I blessed you with and gave you."
[time=3198] We read in Romans 14-10, "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ so that every one of us shall give an account of himself to God."
[time=3208] We're not going to answer for anybody else but ourselves.
[time=3213] And those of you who do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior here this morning in this church are out there in your home.
[time=3219] Someday, you will stand before a holy, righteous God. And if you have not accepted his love gift of Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, there'll be no excuse.
[time=3233] Some of you heard the gospel over and over again. There will be absolutely no excuse.
[time=3241] You'll have nothing to say to him. He will not ask you what church were you a member of. How many good things did you do for people down there?
[time=3249] He will not answer that. He'll say, "Ask one thing. What was your relationship with my son Jesus Christ?"
[time=3258] And some of the most sobering words in all the Bible are found in Matthew, the Sermon and Mount where Jesus said to men and women who said to him, "In your name I did this, and in your name I did that, and Jesus said, "Depart from me I never knew you."
[time=3273] You see, the acid test is intimate knowledge with Jesus Christ.
[time=3281] And you'll give an account if you don't know him.
[time=3286] But everyone of us who know Jesus Christ as our Savior will give an account to of how we spent these lives down here.
[time=3294] What we did with our lives, whether we wasted them, whether we splundered them, whether we lived basically for ourselves and our own desires and our own ambitions, our own aspirations,
[time=3308] or whether indeed with all that we have we sought earnestly to know what his good and perfect and acceptable will is, and we follow that.
[time=3318] As a young man in Wheaton College years ago and a young Christian too, quite ignorant of the Word of God and many things that it had to say,
[time=3329] I was studying pre-law to be a lawyer, and some of the young men on the athletic teams in which I was involved, they were preparing to be pastors and some of them even missionaries,
[time=3342] and I scratched my head literally, and I remember talking to some of my closest friends on these teams, and I said, "What in the world are you going to do that for?"
[time=3351] "Why are you planning to throw your life away in Africa?" "You could make it big here."
[time=3361] And they said, "Listen, Russ, if you know Jesus Christ as your Savior, you don't live your life the way you want it, you find out what he has for you.
[time=3374] And you know the verse that really stabbed my heart was over in 1 Corinthians 6, "What don't you know that you're not your own?"
[time=3383] "You've been bought with a price, the precious blood of Jesus Christ, and you're to glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are his."
[time=3393] "Oh, I trust this morning that you'll understand if you know him as your Savior, you don't belong to yourselves."
[time=3400] "Have you honestly considered what God's will is for you? What God's purpose is for you?"
[time=3406] "Have you honestly asked him, Lord, how can I be involved in worldwide missions? What do I have in my hand?
[time=3416] I don't want to grasp it to myself. I want you to have it, and you're adequate to use me."
[time=3423] "And someday I shall give an account to you."
[time=3429] You know, those are sobering thoughts.
[time=3434] And I'm so thankful that Moses probably didn't understand how God was going to use a rod.
[time=3440] But he said, "Lord, if you want it, here it is." And you know, there's a tremendous verse over in the Word of God in Psalm 77, and I want to close with this this morning.
[time=3452] That Psalm tells of God's greatness how he led his people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
[time=3459] But in Psalm 77, 20 we read this, "Thou letest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses."
[time=3471] Isn't that great?
[time=3473] God Almighty led his people out of captivity through the wilderness.
[time=3479] We do it by the hand of His servant Moses.
[time=3485] Moses, what do you have in your hand? A rod.
[time=3491] Let me have it. Make it available to me.
[time=3495] Let me have it. It's adequate because of who I am.
[time=3499] Let me have it Moses, because someday you will give an account of how you've used that in your life.
