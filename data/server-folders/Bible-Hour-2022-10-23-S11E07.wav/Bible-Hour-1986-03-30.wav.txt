[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=123] And now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=138] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=141] Then take my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord,
[time=161] I'll bring my soul, I say to God to me, I'll bring the Lord, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=184] Thank you very much, you may be seated. Come, let us exalt His name together, for He is alive,
[time=196] He is risen. Welcome this Easter Sunday morning to our morning worship service, as we've gathered
[time=202] today to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ is alive, that He has died on the cross for
[time=209] our sins, and that He rose victorious over death to prove that He was God, and we've come today
[time=216] to worship Him. I can't tell you how thankful I am to be able to worship with you this morning.
[time=223] Last Sunday we worshiped at Kamias Christian Bible Church in Quezon City, Philippines,
[time=230] and there were 140 people worshiping the Lord. The Sunday before that in Kofu, Japan with
[time=236] 50 committed Japanese Christians, but today to worship with you, what a joy it is, to
[time=242] see your faces. I never thought I would want to see the day that I would really miss how great thou art, but I missed it. They started church over there without how great thou art.
[time=254] I don't know how they expected the Lord to work, but He did. He really did. Welcome this
[time=260] morning. We also want to greet our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour, and to each of you, it's our prayer that today that Jesus Christ will be seen. In our worship,
[time=270] in our praying, in our singing, and our studying, He walked the way of the roses, the way of
[time=277] suffering, the Via Dela Rosa only to rise again. Listen as our choir sings, "The Via
[time=285] Dela Rosa."
[time=315] In Jerusalem that day, the soldiers tried to clear the narrow street, but the crowd
[time=329] pressed in to see the men condemned to die on gallery.
[time=338] Gallery of Dela Rosa, on the way of suffering, like a land in the Messiah, Christ the King.
[time=352] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you and me.
[time=363] Down the Via Dela Rosa, all the way to gallery.
[time=378] He was leaning from a meeting, there were strikes upon His back, and He wore a crowd
[time=388] for someone His hand, and He wore with every spell, the sore how those who cried out for
[time=402] His hand.
[time=403] Gallery of Dela Rosa, of the way of suffering, like a land in the Messiah, Christ the King.
[time=417] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you and me.
[time=430] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you, the way of suffering, like a
[time=447] land in the Messiah, Christ the King, and He chose to walk that road out of His love
[time=466] for you and me.
[time=481] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you and me.
[time=499] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you, the way of suffering and me.
[time=526] I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.
[time=532] And the life I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself
[time=538] for me.
[time=539] Crown Him with many crowns, Him number thirteen, we'll sing together the first, third and fifth stanzas, let us sing joyously together.
[time=561] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you and me.
[time=577] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you, and He chose to walk that road
[time=593] out of His love for you and me.
[time=611] And He chose to walk that road out of His love for you and me, and He chose to walk
[time=634] that road out of His love for you and me, and He chose to walk that road out of His love
[time=660] for you and me.
[time=673] This morning is our first Sunday back from a trip to visit missionaries that our church supports.
[time=680] Kathy and I went to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.
[time=684] We'd like to take some time this morning and the next two Sunday mornings to tell you about each of those places.
[time=690] The reason why we went to the fields that we did go to is because going to the Orient
[time=696] allowed us to visit not only four missionaries, but three of those are from Black Hawk Baptist
[time=702] Church, and that was a priority to us.
[time=705] We went to Hong Kong where Carol Bibbing House is serving.
[time=709] We went to Japan where Mary Cruz is serving who is from our church, and then the Philippines were Dr. Ken and Alice Cole from our church are serving, and Mike and Carolyn Ballas are
[time=720] serving.
[time=722] Because we are going to the Philippines and other places, a number of people raised questions of concern about safety, and there were a few points of danger, but once we got past Cleveland, Ohio, everything was safe.
[time=737] Actually each of those places were somewhere between tranquil and positively enthusiastic
[time=743] about their country, and we could not have been a more delightful experience from that standpoint.
[time=749] Today, we would like to take just a few moments to tell you about Japan.
[time=753] Next week, Hong Kong, and then the next week, the Philippines, and after all that, we'll take a Sunday evening and give a full report, but today, Japan.
[time=763] Much to our surprise, Japan is a very superstitious country.
[time=768] The first morning we went by a Shinto shrine where a priest was blessing a truck so that
[time=774] the evil spirits would stay away, and it would be a good truck.
[time=778] The people are very noble people and a very proud people, and not open to the gospel of
[time=784] Jesus Christ primarily because it's not Japanese in its origin.
[time=789] But there was an excited group of Christians there at Kofu Community Church.
[time=794] Kofu is a city the size of Fort Wayne, but unlike Fort Wayne, there are only six Christian
[time=800] churches there, and of those six, we were in the largest.
[time=804] The Sunday morning we were there, the attendance almost reached 50 people, but those 50 people
[time=811] were very committed.
[time=813] One of the main ways that we can advance the gospel in Japan is through English classes
[time=819] because the Japanese want to learn English.
[time=822] We had been up for about 30 hours straight getting to Japan, and I'm standing in a train terminal, and a Japanese man walks up and starts talking about everything, and finally
[time=833] says, "How do you like my English?" And I was able to assure him that it was much better than my Japanese.
[time=841] And teaching English is a way of exposing them to the gospel.
[time=845] And so missionaries and Christians who are Japanese offer English classes and use the
[time=851] Bible as their textbook.
[time=854] And we had a luncheon that was planned for another group of people, and we were invited to go to it.
[time=859] It was a group of people who had taken Mary Cruz's English class at the university.
[time=864] And a Japanese professor who's the head of the English department sat across from me, a very Winston man.
[time=871] And in the middle of the lunch he said, "I understand that you are Miss Mary's." They always call her Miss Mary or Mary Son.
[time=877] "I understand that you are Miss Mary's pastor from America." And I said, "Yes." He said, "Then you should know this." I took Miss Mary's class to learn the nuances of your Indiana English.
[time=894] And Miss Mary uses the Bible, and we only took the class to learn the English.
[time=900] But now I too am interested in the Bible.
[time=906] I don't know what I expected from the people.
[time=908] Going to another country, I've never done that before, so it was a real education.
[time=912] I knew they'd be different in many ways, especially physically.
[time=916] They looked different.
[time=917] They definitely talked different, but the hardest thing was the way they ate.
[time=921] They ate very, very different than we eat.
[time=926] I survived on rice for a whole week, and whenever we passed McDonald's, I just grabbed what I could and we just eaten and enjoyed every bit of it.
[time=934] I hope I never say anything bad about McDonald's.
[time=939] But there were some areas where there were absolutely no barriers, and that's when we begin to talk about the Lord.
[time=945] To the Christians, especially in the church where we were at, when you just mentioned the Lord's name, I can't begin to tell you the joy and peace that came on their faces.
[time=955] Here in America, we talk about the Lord, and we learn to say things, and it just becomes habit and second nature to us, but to them.
[time=964] A bit of their thought goes into when they talk about the Lord.
[time=967] They think about everything.
[time=968] They meditate on everything.
[time=970] They eat it up because it's just not there, and I can't begin to explain to you the sadness
[time=977] and the grief that came on their faces.
[time=979] It was like looking at little children who were disappointed when they realized that most
[time=985] of their people were going to hell, and they were very, very hard people to reach, and that
[time=991] the sadness on their face will be in my mind and my thought.
[time=994] Before I go to sleep every night, their faces are always right there.
[time=998] I hope I never forget that because it taught me a lot to be thankful for, but I tell you,
[time=1004] I love those people.
[time=1005] They're beautiful people, and those who became Christians, where their lives were changed
[time=1011] in every aspect.
[time=1013] They sacrificed more than you and I would ever believe you'd have to sacrifice.
[time=1018] And they'd finally make that final decision, and it would take them months, even years to ponder, "Should I really make this decision?" But when they did, it changed their lives.
[time=1029] Here in America, we make a decision, and maybe a couple years later, our lives begin to change, but every aspect of their life changed, and the Christians there were absolutely beautiful.
[time=1039] And I tell you, someday I hope I'm like them because they were beautiful Christians.
[time=1046] On Sunday morning, we worshiped in Kofu Gospel Bible Church.
[time=1053] The pastor there has been there 20 years, and it's considered a tremendous example of
[time=1059] Japanese church growth because they're over 50 people on most Sundays.
[time=1063] I received a letter already since we've been back.
[time=1066] The letter came from Mary, who was writing for her pastor, Soshi Mizoguchi, who thanked
[time=1073] us for coming.
[time=1074] He said, "There have been missionaries in and out of Japan for the 20 years that he's been there, not many, but there's always been some." He said, "But in 20 years, no one has ever came to Japan to see what was happening."
[time=1088] And he just poured out his heart of how much it meant that someone would come and see.
[time=1093] And then over a lunch at Mary's house, the pastor and I were talking.
[time=1098] He was very, very sad because Mary is leaving Kofu.
[time=1101] She'll be home next year, and then when she goes back to Japan, she won't be in Kofu, and there won't be a missionary to work with their church or the whole city the size of Fort Wayne.
[time=1111] And he looked at me and he said, "Miss Mary says, 'There are 1500 people in your church
[time=1119] in America.
[time=1120] Is that true?'" I said, "Well, about that, many." He said, "Miss Mary, you can't come back, but you have 1500 people.
[time=1131] Could you send us at least one?
[time=1133] Could you send us one who would help us reach our country for Christ?
[time=1139] We're praying that God will raise up at least one person out of these 1500 people who will say, "I'll learn Japanese and I'll go to Kofu to help win people to Christ.
[time=1153] Thank you for giving us the opportunity to see a field that so desperately needs Christ and to share it with you this morning.
[time=1160] The ladies' trio now is going to remind us of Christ's love.
[time=1164] For us and for the people of Japan in song.
[time=1168] Thank you.
[time=1169] In my darkness, Jesus found me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me.
[time=1188] Touch my eyes and made me see, broke since James had long yet found me, gave me life and
[time=1202] liberty.
[time=1203] Oh, glorious love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made him stoop to sail a soul like mine.
[time=1217] Through all my days and then, heaven above, my song will silence never, I will ship him
[time=1230] forever and praise him for his glorious love.
[time=1238] Oh, amazing truth to ponder, he whom angel hosts attend, Lord of him does not what wander.
[time=1257] He became the sinner's friend, oh, glorious love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made
[time=1272] him stoop to sail a soul like mine.
[time=1276] Through all my days and then, heaven above, my song will silence never, I will ship him
[time=1287] forever and praise him for his glorious love, my song will silence never, I will ship him
[time=1299] forever and praise him for his glorious love, and praise him for his glorious love.
[time=1313] Praise him, for his glorious love.
[time=1325] Hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=1334] Peter, it is a great joy to be back home in Fort Wayne and here at Black Hawk.
[time=1338] Eric, we really missed you, we're glad to see you back, I've already seen several of our members and they're just delighted to look forward to seeing you this morning.
[time=1346] We could not be more thankful than to have had the privilege that was just ours to visit our missionaries in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.
[time=1355] And as great as that trip was, it wasn't as great as being home.
[time=1359] There's something about being home after the vacation or the trips particularly that you took, it's just nice to be home but I'm sure that you have some reports that are going to refresh our minds as to the ministry of our missionaries on the field.
[time=1372] We experience so many things, I think for the next two or three weeks the people will be happy to hear the reports but we'll probably keep going for about two years and then they'll be tired of hearing those reports but the things that we saw are things that are almost impossible to put into words, just the spiritual hunger of the people in the Philippines for example, it was just eye opening.
[time=1394] Rick did you find that the Philippines was fairly tranquil?
[time=1397] Was there a freedom there as a result of the latest change of government?
[time=1403] Well we went with a little bit of concern, is this really a safe place to be in the world and it absolutely is.
[time=1410] The state of the Philippines is in a state of absolute excitement, it's a positive high
[time=1417] enthusiastic atmosphere, you just can't imagine it.
[time=1421] The whole nation is as though you're at IU University of the day they won the National Championship in basketball or something, there's just a new sense of freedom there and enthusiasm about their country.
[time=1433] I suppose that's shared by the nationals and is that shared by the missionaries as well?
[time=1437] Do they feel like they have the same inroads to the community and so forth?
[time=1441] Absolutely, one of the things that we were led to believe back here is that Marcos was the only one who was able to protect from communism and if Marcos wasn't there, missions would be in serious trouble and we visited with, I don't know how many different missionaries in the Philippines because we're at the Christian Academy in the universities and they are more enthusiastic now than they've ever been and missions in the Philippines is wide open.
[time=1467] That country is probably more receptive to the gospel than our own right now.
[time=1472] You mentioned another church, was that in Hong Kong that was especially on fire and exciting
[time=1478] and Hong Kong there was but particularly in Japan, there was a group of believers which was unusual because Japan is not open to the gospel, they're legally open but they're not spiritually sensitive so we're looking forward to the next few Sundays, we're going to be giving brief reports and then on Sunday night but it's good to be home particularly on this Easter Sunday morning to be in this place and to celebrate the fact that Jesus
[time=1504] Christ is alive and what we saw is that his living power is changing lives around this
[time=1510] world.
[time=1511] The most important thing though is that Christ can change your life and perhaps you've heard all about Christ, maybe you've watched this broadcast week after week and you know about Christ but you really don't know him.
[time=1524] They have a helpful booklet for you on becoming a Christian and Pete wants to tell you about that.
[time=1530] You know Rick several years ago there was a booklet that mentioned that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life and I'm amazed as I began to read the booklet on becoming a Christian that there was a statement in there that many are ignorant of Christianity and therefore don't accept and there are many that would like to accept but just simply have not had anyone approach them with the gospel and we'd like to say to you that the book becoming a Christian is available and clearly outline step by step what it means
[time=1559] to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, a person is lost without him and cannot have eternal life, what one must do to be saved and it's very clear and concise probably the
[time=1571] most important booklet that you could read if you do not know Jesus as your personal Savior and you could receive that booklet becoming a Christian by writing to the Bible power, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1587] I encourage you to write for that booklet today.
[time=1590] You know one of the mistakes that people make both here and in Japan was amazing to
[time=1597] Kathy and to me.
[time=1599] When we were talking to them about missions in different places where missionaries were needed and we mentioned parts of the United States they said but America is a Christian nation and there's just the assumption in Japan that everyone here is a Christian and yet many people here think I'm a Christian simply because you're a part of our culture
[time=1618] and there has to be a new birth in your life for you to become a Christian and that is why this booklet is so important and we want you to read it so you can make certain that you are truly a Christian by the new birth.
[time=1631] Please do write to us today at the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1640] Now we go back to our morning worship service and we look forward again to the ministry of music.
[time=1645] Yes, Marilyn Wong will be singing for us a triumphal song, great.
[time=1649] Thank you for joining us and if you don't have your Bible get it right now as you can study God's Word with us, Jesus Christ, risen and reigning.
[time=1661] [MUSIC]
[time=1679] Jesus keep me near the cross, there a fountain flowing, free to all the healing stream,
[time=1708] flows from Calvary's mountain, in the cross, in the cross, be my glory ever.
[time=1737] Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.
[time=1762] Here the cross, the trembling soul, love and mercy found me.
[time=1781] Here the bright and morning star sheds its beams around me, near the cross I'll watch
[time=1807] it, hoping trusting ever, till I reach that golden strand, just beyond the river.
[time=1836] In the cross, in the cross, be my glory ever.
[time=1860] Till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river.
[time=1884] [MUSIC]
[time=1895] Thank you, Marilyn, God, it is our prayer today, not only our song.
[time=1914] You would keep us near the cross, near to your son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1921] We've come to worship you today and to say that you are worthy of our total devotion.
[time=1928] And we today, Lord, as though there were an altar of sacrifice here, come to lay our lives down and to say they belong to you.
[time=1936] And I, for one, God today, want to say that you are worthy of total devotion and to surrender myself afresh to you.
[time=1946] May we find this place to be a daily living world of outreach.
[time=1953] God, give us a vision for our office and our neighborhoods.
[time=1957] Thank you today that a friend like Joe would take a stand for Christ.
[time=1961] We would pray that even this morning there would be others who would come to know him as Savior.
[time=1967] Father, today, through your word, we pray that we would see Jesus in all of His glory.
[time=1973] Alive, risen from the dead, crowned as King.
[time=1980] May He be the King of all the kingdoms of our hearts.
[time=1985] God, today, we pray that you would give strength to those who have lost loved ones.
[time=1990] May they, on this Easter, have planted deep within them the hope of the resurrection.
[time=1995] We pray today for the family of Hazel Huber.
[time=1999] And she has gone to be with you and absent from those who have loved her.
[time=2005] Be the God of all comfort to them.
[time=2007] We pray for Shirley and Neva and the other family members of Richard as he has gone to heaven.
[time=2014] We thank you today that we know with confidence that Ralph and Mary and Michelle
[time=2020] and others are with you.
[time=2023] Help us to have hope above hope.
[time=2026] God made that resurrection power fill our lives and bring healing to our damaged emotions.
[time=2032] Particularly to those who've filled the sting of rejection.
[time=2036] For those whose marriages have suffered through disappointment and infidelity.
[time=2043] God, bring healing.
[time=2046] Please speak to the hearts of teenagers and young adults who are walking in disobedience
[time=2053] and who feel trapped and lonely.
[time=2057] Bring healing, we pray.
[time=2059] Father, through your word this morning, we ask you to speak in Jesus' name.
[time=2065] [AMEN] I had only been a Christian one year.
[time=2071] I was 18 years old and sitting in church enjoying my first Easter as a Christian.
[time=2077] Pastor Burnham began his message as he often did with a rhetorical question.
[time=2082] A question he would ask and we were supposed to answer but each of us to ourselves.
[time=2088] And so such a question was given on Easter Sunday morning.
[time=2092] And David said, "How do you know that Jesus Christ is alive today?"
[time=2099] And then he paused to give us time to think.
[time=2102] And while he paused an 83-year-old lady by the name of Chrissy, Chrissy was adopted by the church.
[time=2109] She was very poor but not poor in spirit.
[time=2112] She stood up and said, "I know he's alive because I talked to him this morning and sat right back down."
[time=2119] How do you know he's alive?
[time=2122] I hope today that you've talked to him this morning because you see Christ in you,
[time=2128] the Apostle Paul said, "Is the hope of glory and the greatest witness for the resurrection of Christ
[time=2135] is Christ in you and of course Christ in me." One man said, "The skeptics of the world can argue against our arguments.
[time=2145] They can deny our claims but they cannot refuse to change life." The greatest testimony of Easter might be sitting in the auditorium today.
[time=2157] Each one of us.
[time=2160] That is the effect that the gospel message should have.
[time=2164] And in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul puts a capstone on this great letter by devoting 58 verses to the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2174] We're going to look at verses 1 through 8 this morning.
[time=2177] In verses 1 and 2, he gives to us the effect of the resurrection.
[time=2190] And then in verses 5 through 8, the evidences for the resurrection.
[time=2195] I'm going to read it to you today from the new international version of the Bible.
[time=2201] Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel.
[time=2206] I preach to you which you have received and which you have taken your stand.
[time=2212] By this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preach to you.
[time=2219] Otherwise you have believed in vain.
[time=2222] For what I have received, I passed on to you as of first importance.
[time=2227] That Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
[time=2232] That he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
[time=2241] And that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve.
[time=2245] After that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep.
[time=2257] He appeared to James then to all the apostles and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born.
[time=2270] I mentioned that he gives us the effect and the importance and then the evidence.
[time=2275] But please allow me to take those in a slightly different order.
[time=2279] Let me begin with verses 3 and 4 that give to us the importance.
[time=2284] In the King James Bible that I often use and many of you had and was on the television screen a moment ago,
[time=2290] it says I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received.
[time=2295] Now he's saying God gave me a message and Paul said I received it and now I'm delivering it to you first.
[time=2302] That tells us it's importance.
[time=2305] Obviously the word first can mean two very different things.
[time=2308] First can mean that which comes first in time sequentially.
[time=2313] If there is a race we talk about who came in first that means the one who first crossed the finish line.
[time=2320] If we give you a sequence of numbers one through ten one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten.
[time=2327] We say which number came first we say well the number one did.
[time=2331] But first can mean something totally different than sequence in time it can mean of importance or position.
[time=2339] For example we might talk about who is the first lady in the United States.
[time=2344] Well our first lady is Nancy Reagan.
[time=2347] That does not mean she was the first lady born in America.
[time=2350] She might not like that if we meant that.
[time=2353] First lady means she has the highest position of all the ladies in America.
[time=2358] She is the first in importance.
[time=2361] She is the wife the confident the advisor the partner of our president.
[time=2367] She is our first lady.
[time=2369] She is the most important.
[time=2371] That Paul is saying something here.
[time=2373] He's saying the most important message of all the message that is above every other message is this one.
[time=2382] That doesn't mean that he reached court and he said resurrection that's my first word.
[time=2387] And he's saying the most important message the message that is above every other message in a word is the resurrection.
[time=2396] Now he goes on to unfold this most important message that he has received from God and is delivering to us as primary importance is the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2407] Why is it so important?
[time=2411] Because if the resurrection of Jesus Christ is true then that is the most significant fact of history.
[time=2420] That God became a man died on the cross for our sins and rose again.
[time=2425] If that is actually true then there is nothing more important than all of history.
[time=2432] And if it's not true then it ought to be shelved right next to Paul Bunyan and his blue ox babe as one of the great fairy tales that have been written.
[time=2441] It's one of the two.
[time=2444] Now when we talk about Jesus rising from the dead we accept that because there are just words to us without meaning.
[time=2454] Because we've heard it all of our life.
[time=2456] I remember when I was little short I'm still that way it could have been yesterday but I mean when I was really short I memorized the apostles creed and that's good stuff.
[time=2468] We in our church we don't memorize a lot of creeds but they're not always bad.
[time=2472] The apostles creed says I believe in God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and earth and in his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2480] I believed all that stuff but they were just words.
[time=2484] And most of us as westerners and particularly as Americans what's Easter old the day Jesus rose again.
[time=2490] But we don't stop and think about what we're saying.
[time=2493] We're actually saying a man died and he rose again.
[time=2498] Take it out of that context.
[time=2500] Take it out of two thousand years ago.
[time=2503] Make it last year.
[time=2506] Let's not be insensitive but let's talk about death for a moment.
[time=2509] Suppose I said you all remember when so-and-so died.
[time=2513] Yes I was at the funeral.
[time=2515] Do you remember we went to the grave and we lowered him down in the grave and they closed that huge cement vault over and they buried him and he was dead.
[time=2525] I remember that.
[time=2526] Well I was just out the cemetery and the graves opened and somebody lifted that huge concrete vault and the caskets opened and hey, nobody's home.
[time=2537] And on the way back I stopped at halls and he's down there eating a Chicago burger right now.
[time=2545] What did you do when I said you laughed.
[time=2549] And you know when Paul stood up on Mars Hill and Athens and he said that Jesus Christ raised from the dead you know what they did.
[time=2557] They laughed.
[time=2558] They did exactly what you and I did.
[time=2561] Now we accept this Jesus two thousand years ago who knows what happened.
[time=2567] We treated as though it was, yeah I also know that George Washington rode across the Delaware.
[time=2573] Actually George didn't row.
[time=2574] He stood on the front like this.
[time=2576] I saw the painting.
[time=2578] You know and we talk, you know all these stories and they just blend together.
[time=2581] Jesus rose from the grave.
[time=2584] They blink and walk five miles to return two pennies.
[time=2589] But stop and think about what we're saying.
[time=2593] Because if a man was God and he died and he rose again then that is proof that he was God and he demands the attention and devotion of all the world.
[time=2605] And that's why we're here.
[time=2607] And if he didn't literally rise from the grave then why on earth are we here.
[time=2613] Because like everyone else I'm prone to sleeping in Sundays in particular.
[time=2621] Paul said this is the most important message of all.
[time=2626] There is nothing in the Bible that is more important than what he is about to say to us.
[time=2631] And he says four statements that each begin with the word that.
[time=2636] Number one that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture.
[time=2644] Now that first two statements is a real problem.
[time=2649] Christ died.
[time=2651] Now we think when we hear the name Jesus Christ that Jesus was the boy born to Mr. and Mrs. Christ.
[time=2658] That that's his last name.
[time=2659] That wasn't his last name.
[time=2661] Christ is the Greek word for anoint it just like the Hebrew word is Messiah.
[time=2666] And the anointed one means God come in the human flesh.
[time=2671] And to say God died that's a paradox.
[time=2676] That's like saying life died.
[time=2679] Perhaps you heard the story about the little boy who ran downstairs and said mommy come quickly my goldfish has just drowned.
[time=2686] She said honey your goldfish may have died but he didn't drowned fish don't drowned.
[time=2691] And God and life do not die but life was nailed to a cross.
[time=2699] And you see why they laughed.
[time=2701] You're saying the God who is always in existence who has all power and who creates life and who is like he can't die.
[time=2708] Christ died and so important is that prepositional phrase that follows for our sins.
[time=2717] The word for is a preposition that can mean a number of things but in this case it means instead of or in behalf of as a substitute for.
[time=2731] It means that somebody has to do something and then someone else comes in and does it for them.
[time=2738] If you ever have the chance to go to Japan as Kathy advised you scout out the McDonald's very quickly.
[time=2746] Our first meal was and this is no exaggeration.
[time=2750] Ross squid raw oysters raw jellyfish.
[time=2759] And I kept noticing that I would eat a little out of my dish and it would grow.
[time=2767] Because my wife was transplanting her jellyfish into my dish.
[time=2775] And every once in a while she would say eat this for me.
[time=2780] Eat this for me.
[time=2783] I was trying to do my best to accommodate these dear brothers and to appreciate their culture.
[time=2788] But I want to tell you eating that for her.
[time=2791] That was no privilege.
[time=2795] And I suddenly learned with this little preposition in behalf of means.
[time=2801] It means to take on something that is someone else's.
[time=2805] And that's exactly what Jesus did.
[time=2809] God in some way took all of my sins and all of your sins and all the sins of the world and this is though he packaged him to Jesus.
[time=2823] And the postage due was death and that he died for our sins and all of that was according to the scripture.
[time=2833] You see God prophesied that this would happen hundreds of years even a thousand years before Christ so that we would never misunderstand the point of it all.
[time=2842] Isaiah 53 said all we like sheep have gone astray.
[time=2846] We have turned everyone to his own way.
[time=2849] And God that laid upon him Messiah the iniquity of us all died according to the scriptures.
[time=2856] Psalm 22 1000 years before Christ was ever born.
[time=2860] Hundreds and hundreds of years before crucifixion was ever used prophetically describes the crucifixion of Christ.
[time=2867] In details says my hands David said speaking for the voice of Messiah and my feet are pierced.
[time=2875] My side is pierced a thousand years.
[time=2880] They gamble they cast lots for my garment.
[time=2885] They stare at me who may have pierced.
[time=2889] That was so we would know that this was the Messiah who had died according to the scriptures.
[time=2895] That's the fact number one.
[time=2897] Fact number two that he was buried.
[time=2902] That little phrase stands to prove that he was actually dead.
[time=2906] He was buried.
[time=2908] He didn't just swoon and come back a few moments later.
[time=2912] This wasn't one of these so-called resurrection experiences we hear today where people die and eight seconds later they're back.
[time=2920] This is somebody who was dead and buried.
[time=2924] And to make sure he was dead the Bible gives us a great deal of evidence.
[time=2929] To hasten the process of death they would break the legs of the victim.
[time=2933] That way the victim could no longer lift himself up to breathe.
[time=2937] When they came to Jesus they noticed that he was already dead.
[time=2941] And these men were professional executioners.
[time=2946] And then one of them out of vindictive anger that he couldn't break one more set of legs.
[time=2951] He took a spear and he stuck it in the side and there came the separated body fluids of a dead man pouring out.
[time=2958] And then Joseph of Arimathea, a believer, went to Pilate.
[time=2964] Great bravery.
[time=2966] And requested the body of Jesus.
[time=2968] And the Bible says the Pilate marveled that he was already dead.
[time=2971] And he sent for the Centurion the captain of these professional executioners and said,
[time=2977] "Is he dead in the Centurion check?" and said, "It is so." He was dead.
[time=2983] Fact number three, that he rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures.
[time=2993] That Jesus Christ actually physically bodily arose from the grave.
[time=3001] Now as I mentioned to you the ancient Greeks when they heard the resurrection they laughed they chuckled.
[time=3007] Because they were platonic, they thought there was body and there was soul and the soul lived forever and the body died.
[time=3014] And the soul was a prisoner in that body.
[time=3017] And now Paul says, "No the body is going to rise." And they said the soul and the whole Paul said the body and they laughed.
[time=3026] Just like the Greeks the modernists today wanted to say, "Oh yes Jesus arose in the Spirit."
[time=3035] Well that's not quite going to work.
[time=3038] If you want to believe the Bible you can't believe that.
[time=3041] You see they went to the tomb and Mary came back and said, "Peter you better come it's empty."
[time=3048] Now if his body just arose or I mean if his spirit just arose then the tomb would not have been empty.
[time=3055] And then they saw the body.
[time=3058] Everybody but Thomas who said, "I won't believe till I touch it." Meaning the body.
[time=3065] And Jesus appeared and said, "Thomas reach out your finger and touch my hand."
[time=3071] He ate fish.
[time=3073] He had a body.
[time=3074] It was the actual body of Christ that arose.
[time=3080] These three statements put together is the basic message of all the Bible.
[time=3088] And it hinges on one fact that Jesus arose from the grave.
[time=3095] If that is true then everything else stands on it is true.
[time=3099] And if that is not true then the whole thing is fiction fairytale and fable.
[time=3105] The resurrection of Christ.
[time=3108] If you are a lawyer it is your evidence proof positive.
[time=3113] If you're a scientist it is your acid test.
[time=3118] If you're a basketball player it's your pivot foot from which everything else moves.
[time=3123] If you're a lawyer it is your courtroom exhibit A.
[time=3130] If you're a philosopher it is your cine quill known.
[time=3134] That which out with there is nothing.
[time=3138] John Lawku most of us know for his treatises on disobedience from which we got our American
[time=3144] Declaration of Independence must have been a believer because he wrote these words.
[time=3149] Our Savior's resurrection is truly of great importance to Christianity.
[time=3155] So great that his being or not being Messiah stands or falls on it.
[time=3167] The most important message of the Bible and of all history is that Christ physically,
[time=3175] bodily died and then he arose again the third day.
[time=3182] And the fourth that that gives us our evidence.
[time=3187] He says first of all he was seen by Cephas and someone said well that's Peter that's one of his cronies who hallucinated, dream this all up and spread it.
[time=3196] Then he was seen by the twelve the rest of the disciples.
[time=3200] Well those are just his friends.
[time=3202] Then he was seen by five hundred people who the majority are still alive Paul says at the time of his writing.
[time=3209] Though some have died. That is a very important statement.
[time=3213] You see for a fable our fiction to develop one of the most crucial ingredients is time.
[time=3220] For a fable to grow there has to be a time factor so that no one can check out the facts.
[time=3227] The witnesses are all gone conveniently.
[time=3232] You hear a great deal of fables coming out of the Philippines about the meldas, three thousand pair of shoes.
[time=3240] But you see you can't start those stories right now because there are too many people who will know.
[time=3245] We went through Malekayon and we saw three thousand pair of shoes it's true.
[time=3250] And you see a story like that can be substantiated today because it's current.
[time=3255] And Paul says these witnesses are still alive it's current.
[time=3259] You can check it out. Paul says he was seen of James then all the apostles and then Paul says I saw him.
[time=3269] Paul said I saw him and he was staking his life on that.
[time=3274] The importance in the evidence but in verses one and two he gives us the effect and we'll have to give this to you very quickly.
[time=3283] He says I want to remind you of the gospel that I preach unto you and he uses three verbs for which describe the effect.
[time=3292] First of all he said on the gospel which you have received.
[time=3297] Beloved if Christ is risen from the grave then you should receive the gospel.
[time=3303] Most of us say I've received it I've heard the message that's not what receive really means.
[time=3308] It means to take upon yourself and internalize it.
[time=3312] One of my favorite parts of clothing are ties I love ties but please don't buy me ties I don't like the ties that people buy for me.
[time=3321] You always get those rare presents to you don't you.
[time=3325] That pink tie with the huge purple polka dots at least you can say I don't have one like this.
[time=3334] A present like that comes and you receive the gift and quickly place it in the back of the closet.
[time=3344] I have a rack of ties over here that are gifts that I may wear when Pete and Carol come over.
[time=3353] Then I have this whole other list of ties that I oh boy those are special.
[time=3359] And I wear those you see the difference between receiving is that you receive a gift and you stick it over here and you don't want it.
[time=3366] And then you receive other gifts and you take them upon yourself.
[time=3370] That's what it means to receive Christ doesn't mean oh I heard it I'll believe that I'll you know whatever sure.
[time=3376] No it means to accept it and to internalize Christ and allow them to come into your life.
[time=3382] And then secondly he says not only do you receive it but you stand on it.
[time=3386] America is the only place I know in the world where you can receive Christ and not take a stand.
[time=3391] You know in Japan until you receive Christ declared publicly by baptism you're not a member they don't even call you a Christian.
[time=3398] It's not that they treat you badly but if you're not willing to take a stand then you're not a part of the church.
[time=3404] You're welcome to come and they call you a watcher.
[time=3409] Until you take a stand and here we don't take stands not very often we try to get socially comfortable.
[time=3419] Paul said on which you have taken your stand and then thirdly he says and notice this this is a little bit tricky.
[time=3426] He said this gospel that saves you if you hold fast.
[time=3433] So where to receive it where to stand on where to hold fast but you'll notice that's an if clause.
[time=3439] You're saying does that mean we could lose our salvation though.
[time=3442] In Greek there are different types of conditional clauses this is a first-class conditional clause which simply means it's a condition of reality.
[time=3449] It's like me turning to my son and saying Adam if you're my son you will.
[time=3454] Well it's not a matter if if he's my son or not I'm simply saying since you're my son you will.
[time=3460] And Paul saying if you sense you then you will hold fast and we're to take a grip on Christ and never let go.
[time=3469] One of the great invitation hymns goes like this I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3475] I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back.
[time=3481] Though no one join me still I will follow.
[time=3487] The world behind me the cross before me.
[time=3492] No turning back.
[time=3496] Would you receive Christ today?
[time=3498] Would you stand for him?
[time=3500] Would you hold fast?
