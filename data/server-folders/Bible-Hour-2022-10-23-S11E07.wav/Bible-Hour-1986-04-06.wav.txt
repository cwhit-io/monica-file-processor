[time=192] Good morning and welcome to our Morning Worship Service.
[time=197] We trust that today that God will use our meeting together to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=205] If you're a regular attender of our church, we thank you for your faithfulness.
[time=209] If you're visiting today, we want to welcome you to our church and hope that God makes you immediately fill the sense of His love that He has for you in Christ Jesus.
[time=221] Also, we want to greet those friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=225] As we televise this service, we're praying that God will send forth through ministry of music and His Word, His love, beyond these walls into the communities of Northern Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. May God bless you today as we worship together.
[time=241] There's a song that says that when we praise your name, we get lifted up. I hope that you've come, first of all, to praise His name.
[time=249] And then as you lift up His name, that He lifts up your spirit.
[time=253] Today we meet because Jesus Christ gave His life for us.
[time=257] It seems amazing that we could gain an interest in the Savior's name.
[time=262] Charles Wesley put it in the question, and can it be, that I should gain an interest in my Savior's name.
[time=270] Please listen as our choir sings of the amazing love of God.
