[time=93] [MUSIC]
[time=114] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hours.
[time=117] Now from the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and the message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hoffs.
[time=132] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=135] [MUSIC - 74 seconds]
[time=219] - Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=221] The Bible says this is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=230] We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[time=233] Of course this is what we call morning worship service, but that's a daily encouragement to view each day as a new opportunity for the Lord.
[time=242] But what a privilege on this first day of the week to gather together in this place and to sing how great thou art, to listen to music, to study his word and to worship God.
[time=253] You know, that's the very purpose for which God created us was to know him and to worship him.
[time=259] Welcome today to our morning worship service and also welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=265] We trust that in this next hour that each of us will gain a glimpse of insight into the person of God and his love for us.
[time=273] Above all else he is a holy God, holy is he.
[time=277] God, a loving God, yes, but by his very character and nature, he is also a holy God.
[time=285] Please listen as our choir sings about that attribute of our Heavenly Father, his holiness.
[time=292] (inspirational music)
[time=320] [MUSIC - 454 seconds]
[time=777] - Hero Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=791] Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=798] These commandments that I give to you today are to be put upon your hearts.
[time=804] Impress them on your children.
[time=806] Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road.
[time=813] When you lie down and when you get up.
[time=816] Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
[time=822] Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates.
[time=827] The Word of God clearly admonishes parents to teach their children about himself.
[time=834] The Lord has mentioned several different aspects of your life in that passage.
[time=840] It really covers all of your hours.
[time=843] And He is to be central in every moment of your life.
[time=847] And parents, He has told you that the responsibility to train your children up is yours.
[time=854] He wants you to be committed to Him and for them to see that through you, for you to teach that to them, to train them.
[time=862] One aspect of Black Hawk Christian School is to provide you with an avenue to accomplish that purpose.
[time=870] We hope that the Word of God is central, that the Lord Jesus Christ is focused upon each day in our school.
[time=878] We start each day that way with devotions, prayer time, looking into His Word, and as teachers embody the living Word of God and train your children up, if they'll just continue to be in God's Word, they will be successful.
[time=896] If they'll do the things that He has told them to do, if your children will hear the things that God has instructed us to teach, then we'll be successful.
[time=905] Success means that your child grows up to be a man of God or a woman of God.
[time=911] Other successes are byproducts of that.
[time=914] And we want to train them for some of those as well.
[time=917] We teach English and social studies and history and math and science to prepare them to be successful in this world in the areas that are secondary.
[time=927] First of all, we want them to know the Lord Jesus and to love Him with all their heart, their soul, their mind, and their strength.
[time=935] We pray that you will consider Christian education.
[time=939] If you're a parent who hasn't thought about that in the past, we would like for you to do that.
[time=944] To consider the fact that there are many hours during the week that your children would have an opportunity here to hear the truth as it's spoken by teachers and as we read it and memorize it together.
[time=955] Our fifth and sixth grade choir is coming to sing for us at this time.
[time=962] It's my pleasure to introduce them.
[time=964] Mr. Rich Ledeke is their director.
[time=966] He is preparing for a musical called Babble at Babel.
[time=971] Some of my government students think that was named after me, but it wasn't.
[time=975] Babble at Babel will be performed here.
[time=978] Part of the performance that night will be this group.
[time=982] They're called the Music Gallery.
[time=985] There are fifth and sixth graders who have auditioned for this choir.
[time=988] The song they're about to sing is a paraphrase from 1 Corinthians, chapter 13, called "I Am Nothing At All."
[time=1007] Though I speak with the times of men and angels, if I have no charity, my voice is just like a noisy symbol, like a pointless league.
[time=1020] Like a tower of battle, I will crumble and fall.
[time=1023] I am nothing at all.
[time=1027] Like a tower of battle, I will crumble and fall.
[time=1030] Or I am nothing at all without love.
[time=1037] I am nothing at all.
[time=1039] Like a tower of battle, I will crumble and fall.
[time=1040] I am nothing at all.
[time=1042] Like a tower of battle, I will crumble and fall.
[time=1043] I am nothing at all without love.
[time=1127] I sincerely hope that God has encouraged you already through this broadcast by the ministry of music.
[time=1132] Joining Pete and myself today is our friend Iida Tofolo.
[time=1136] Hello, Iida.
[time=1137] Good morning, Rick.
[time=1138] Thank you for joining us and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=1141] Hello, Pete.
[time=1142] Good morning.
[time=1143] Listen, some of the music that we had today is from our Christian school.
[time=1146] I did schedule it, but I really can't take any credit for it.
[time=1148] It was the music gallery with Rich Leedikey leading them.
[time=1153] Well, we're sure glad to have our school as a vital part of our ministry, and that's why we've asked Iida Tofolo to join us today.
[time=1161] Several times we've introduced you to our friend, our school administrator, Steve Longbreak.
[time=1166] Iida teaches in our school and is also the elementary coordinator, and one of the reasons why we've asked you to be here today is you were part of the beginning of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1175] That's exactly right, Rick.
[time=1178] We're in our thirteenth year, and we started our school with part-time pre-K teacher, part-time kindergarten teacher, and two full-time teachers.
[time=1188] I had first and second grade, and Happy Waltz had third and fourth grade, and I think we ended that year with about 33 students.
[time=1195] Well, that was a good start.
[time=1197] That was excellent.
[time=1199] It was like having a family, a small family, and having come from a public school, it was very, very different, beginning with just a few students.
[time=1208] But, you know, by the end of the second year, I think we almost tripled our enrollment, so that was really great.
[time=1213] Well, those are the early days.
[time=1215] Now, this is the thirteenth year, and the family's a little bigger, isn't it?
[time=1219] That's exactly right.
[time=1220] I think now we're close to almost 300 students in our school.
[time=1223] Well, this is an exciting time to talk about the school, because registration is coming up, and we have many of the classes already full, so I hope we're not disappointing some of you by telling you about the school, and then you won't be able to come, but most of the classes do have room for one or two more students.
[time=1241] Aida, you mentioned that you've been teaching in the public schools for a number of years, and now you've been in Christian education for 13 years.
[time=1248] Contrast and compare the two systems for us.
[time=1251] Well, Rick, I spent a lot of years in the public school.
[time=1254] We won't ask how many.
[time=1255] Okay, please don't.
[time=1257] And I just want to tell you, and the people out there, because there may be some former students, I have a lot of them out there, as well as parents and teaching colleagues.
[time=1268] And my memories of the public school experience are very, very fun.
[time=1272] In fact, about two weeks ago, I went back to my school, Frankie Park School.
[time=1276] They celebrated 25th anniversary.
[time=1279] And it was just really neat to see some of my former students and parents.
[time=1283] So my memories of the public school are very, very fun.
[time=1286] But I just have to say that coming into a Christian school, all the emphasis is entirely different.
[time=1293] And one of the reasons I'm here is because we can use God's word as truth.
[time=1298] And we can pray.
[time=1299] I can share my faith with the kids.
[time=1302] And it's a whole different experience.
[time=1304] You know, I think sometimes we don't understand, as the public, how precious that is until you try to go into a public situation, not just the schools, but particularly the schools, and try to do the simplest things such as pray.
[time=1318] It becomes a major controversy.
[time=1320] That's exactly right.
[time=1321] And the neat thing about being in a Christian school is that you can stop anytime through the day if you need to, to pray.
[time=1327] You can read God's word.
[time=1329] And it's great the way the kids implement God's word into their lives.
[time=1333] Well, we are excited to have you as a part of it.
[time=1336] Tell us a little bit about the goals that we have here for our students.
[time=1340] And now I'm looking on as a parent of a next year's first grader.
[time=1344] Well, you know, Rick, when I came to start the school here at Blackhawk, one of my goals was to help the children see Christianity as a total way of life.
[time=1353] I like to look at it as a circle.
[time=1355] We have the school, we have the family, and we have the church.
[time=1358] And if any one of those areas, if there's a slack in any one of those areas, one of the other areas needs to pick that up.
[time=1365] We just reinforce each other.
[time=1367] And that's the way the Christian school works, actually.
[time=1370] It's just an arm of the church and arm of the family.
[time=1373] And here to reinforce all of those values that we hold dear as Christians.
[time=1378] You know, one of the frustrations I often feel, and I'm not teaching in the school, but as a part of the church is occasionally, people walk through the doors of the church or the school and expect it instantly by the fact that they've attended everything in life is going to change, where all we can do is be one part of the team.
[time=1394] And what you've said about the family is so important.
[time=1397] Also, one of the goals that I had, and maybe I mentioned this earlier, is that kids would see Christianity as a total way of life.
[time=1404] Not something we just put on Sunday.
[time=1406] When you go to Sunday school, go to church.
[time=1408] But every area of their life, as Christian young people, has to be touched by that experience.
[time=1414] And I think that's what we're trying to do in the Christian school.
[time=1417] Well, you're doing a good job of it.
[time=1419] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1420] Before we change our subject, anything else you'd like to share about the school?
[time=1425] I would just like to invite anyone that's interested in Christian education to visit our school.
[time=1430] And there's a very important date that's coming up on April 22.
[time=1434] We're hosting Dr. Anthony Fortosis, who's a professor from Baptist
[time=1440] Bible College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=1442] He will be here to meeting that evening at seven o'clock.
[time=1445] And if you're interested in Christian education, if you've had even the Vegas notion that you might be interested, please come to that meeting.
[time=1452] We would welcome you to be here.
[time=1454] Thank you.
[time=1455] And I'll be at that meeting.
[time=1456] And I want to add my encouragement to Edis for you to join us on April 22.
[time=1461] Pete, you have a helpful little booklet that is so important about growing in Christ once a person's made that initial commitment.
[time=1468] You're right, Rick.
[time=1469] You know, there is a relationship that begins when we accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.
[time=1473] And there are some principles by which we should live the Christian life.
[time=1477] I'd like to introduce you to a booklet that's entitled Beginning Your New Life in the Spirit.
[time=1482] This booklet is a concise point-by-point outline of how you can live the Christian life.
[time=1489] We'd like to send that to you absolutely free.
[time=1491] You can write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1500] Let me encourage you if you've just accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior to write for this booklet.
[time=1505] Once again, the address is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1514] Aida and Pete, thank you for being a part of the ministry not only today, but every day of the week, year by year.
[time=1520] And thank you for joining us.
[time=1522] Now we're going to go back to the live part of our Morning Worship Service and want to invite you to open your Bible and study with us what God's Word has to say about facing temptation.
[time=1539] [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=1694] [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=1704] Thank you, Scott.
[time=1706] Great is the Lord and worthy of honor.
[time=1712] The song goes on to say, "I lift up my voice." That's what we've done this morning as a congregation has lifted up our voice and we have sung "Great is the Lord." Three Sundays ago, Kathy and I were with another church.
[time=1726] Kamehos, Christian Bible Fellowship in Quezon City, Manila, the Philippines.
[time=1731] They didn't sing "Great is the Lord," but their fire and their enthusiasm for Christ was an excitement to be a part of.
[time=1739] Jesus said, "Look under the fields for their whiten to harvest." The Philippines is truly a field where the people are white.
[time=1747] They're ready, they're anxious to learn about Christ.
[time=1750] It's a place where evangelism is wide open, and we as a church have the privilege of supporting three missionaries and the Philippines and two of them from our church, Ken and Alice Cole and Mike and Carolyn Ballast are working there.
[time=1765] Amongst a group of people who are excited about sharing Christ, one of those people is a young lady named Edna who really left an impression on Kathy.
[time=1776] As we flew into the Philippines, I had the privilege of sitting by the window seat, and it was just a beautiful sight as we were flying over that big body of water and as it met up with the land of the Philippines.
[time=1788] And as we got closer, the plane was getting ready to land, it was getting lower and lower, and I could see lots of trees, lots of mountains, lots of volcanoes, but I also looked down and I blinked my eyes.
[time=1799] I couldn't believe what I saw and I thought it's true.
[time=1802] Missionaries do live in grass huts, because they were grass huts all over the place, and I thought, "Oh no." After that food in Japan and after the shock I had in Hong Kong for five days, I'm going to be living in a grass hut, and there probably is no place to plug in my electric curlers.
[time=1820] But the plane kept going, God heard the cry of a desperate woman, and he let it land in Manila, and it was just beautiful.
[time=1829] It was a very big city there in Manila, and we received a great welcome from our missionaries there.
[time=1834] But not only from our missionaries, but from the people, the people that we really grew to love,
[time=1840] people that really loved the Lord, and they showed it in every aspect of their life.
[time=1845] They found great pleasure and great joy of talking about the Lord, and probably my favorite person that I met there was a young lady by the name of Edna.
[time=1854] She just left a real impression of my life, and she really taught me a lot too.
[time=1858] Edna and I, I had the privilege of going out with Edna on an evangelism call.
[time=1862] They have an evangelism class just like we do here.
[time=1865] They do it in their own language, and they go out and they meet with the people in their neighborhoods.
[time=1871] And we had an appointment to meet a young lady, and this young lady was rather nervous about meeting with us, and she never showed up for the appointment, and the look of disappointment on Edna's face was unbelievable.
[time=1883] And as I looked at her, I thought, boy, when was the last time I was that disappointed, because I didn't get to share the gospel with somebody, or someone refused to accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=1894] And I looked at her, and I just was impressed with her, and I just really studied her life.
[time=1899] And she lived her life as if every moment counted, as if God was coming back tomorrow.
[time=1905] She needed to lead as many people as she could to the Lord, because they don't have much time.
[time=1911] So in her conversation, in her walk, everything she does glorified the Lord.
[time=1917] And as the song says that Sandy Patti sings, "When the time comes, I want him to know me.
[time=1924] And when the time comes, I want to be ready, for he will come and take me. He'll take me home."
[time=1932] And Edna lived as if God was coming tomorrow, and he was going to take her home.
[time=1937] And I learned from her that I've got a lot of work to do here in America.
[time=1941] I need to work hard like she did.
[time=1945] The Philippines is a country that is very much economically depressed.
[time=1951] Their basic unit of currency is a peso, like our dollar.
[time=1956] Only their peso is worth our nickel.
[time=1959] And many, many of the people, probably the average person, makes about 100 pesos a month.
[time=1968] And everything there is cheaper, but not that much cheaper.
[time=1972] They live many of them in what are called squatter settlements.
[time=1976] A squatter settlement is a piece of ground that nobody else claimed, so people moved in.
[time=1981] They would build houses out of anything they could find, plywood, metal, and quite often cardboard.
[time=1989] We met a lady by the name of Winnie.
[time=1992] Winnie and her daughter lived in the squatter settlement.
[time=1995] Squatter settlements are these shacks side-by-side row after row.
[time=2000] Compared to a Filipino, I'm a relatively large person, both height and width.
[time=2006] And I literally had to turn sideways and duck to get down between the squatter settlements.
[time=2012] Winnie's home was made out of cardboard with a tin roof and was almost as big as our bathtub.
[time=2020] That's what two people lived in, something about, oh, three foot by four foot.
[time=2025] And that was home, no water, no electricity, just cardboard walls.
[time=2031] Mike Ballast introduced us and she couldn't speak much English, but she just stared at us with the biggest smile and said I'm a Christian.
[time=2040] I'm a Christian too, and then turned to Mike and began to speak in Tagawa and Mike laughed and looked at me and said,
[time=2046] Winnie would like to talk to you, but she knows you don't understand the language of heaven, so I'll have to interpret.
[time=2054] And she just thought that was the greatest spot in the world.
[time=2058] Mike and Carolyn have done a great job building a church there.
[time=2062] Then we have another missionary couple, Ken and Alice Cole.
[time=2065] They have a really difficult task and an important task that you can be praying for.
[time=2072] Many of the people are very poor in the Philippines, but there's also an element of people who are financially very capable.
[time=2079] And much of the evangelism has worked with the down and outers and ignored the up and outers.
[time=2085] And so their job is to try to build a church amongst the Filipino people in the more developed settlements.
[time=2092] And many of them are like Americans, they have a sense of self-sufficiency and pride that they don't need anything.
[time=2098] But Mike and Alice and Carolyn and the whole team of people over there have just been working together and it's been great.
[time=2106] Ken Cole has started a Bible study in an office.
[time=2110] The owner of the business thought the Bible study was so good that he just told all the employees to stop working and to come to the Bible study.
[time=2118] And so they work Saturdays and every Saturday afternoon they just stop for a Bible study in the middle of the day.
[time=2124] And Kathy had the privilege of singing and I had the privilege of teaching a Bible study to about 40 office people who would be very much of a different persuasion than the belief in Christ that you and I know.
[time=2135] And they're doing a great job so do pray for the Coles as they work to plan a church.
[time=2141] They've won several people to Christ and two or three of them are saying let's start the church now.
[time=2147] And they'll soon be starting that church. Would you join us in praying to that end?
[time=2152] God we would pray for your hand of blessing to be upon your people in the Philippines and those particularly that we love.
[time=2160] We pray for Ken and Alice as they work to build this new church for Mike and Carolyn as they now turn over the leadership of a church that they have started to the Filipino people.
[time=2172] We would pray for Pastor Ernie Gordovis as he leads that church that your hand would be upon it.
[time=2179] We pray for those people that their fire would never grow dim but their enthusiasm for Christ would leap and dance with flames of evangelism.
[time=2189] God we pray for this church that we with our prosperity and our technology of America would never ever fail to see that it is our job as people to share Christ.
[time=2203] That people telling people is your only plan.
[time=2209] Father we pray for this church that you might give us a heart for evangelism in this community and around the world.
[time=2217] Thank you for Mike and Carolyn and Ken and Alice who labor for you gone out from this community to serve you.
[time=2226] We thank you for their example and their effectiveness.
[time=2230] Father we pray for this body today that your word would dwell in our hearts richly and that as we face the testing and the trying and the temptations that you would stand by our side.
[time=2242] We pray for those today who suffer particularly for Donna Christian and her family and the loss of her father.
[time=2250] We pray for those who have lost loved ones in recent days and who walk alone.
[time=2256] We pray for those who are single parents and wrestle the most difficult job in life by themselves.
[time=2263] We would pray today for those in the hospital for Pat McIntosh for Jane Brouser.
[time=2270] For those today who suffer from surgery and are recovering like Nancy Gardner.
[time=2277] God please place your hand upon them.
[time=2280] Give strength to their life.
[time=2282] Through your word strengthen each of us we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=2290] Perhaps Gettysburg is the most famous of civil war sites and battlefields of history at least in this country.
[time=2301] It was significant because of the number of men who gave their lives on each side of the battle line.
[time=2308] Historians labeled as the turning point in the Civil War where the Union forces were finally able to repel the armies of Northern Virginia.
[time=2318] At Gettysburg the Confederate forces were led by General James Longstreet.
[time=2324] Not one of the most prominent men of history but certainly one of the significant generals of that era.
[time=2331] Longstreet's men had attacked several times and again he sent the orders to one of his men to bring up a column of troops.
[time=2343] The leader of that column reported to the general and said general the men are tired in their weary.
[time=2348] In general I cannot bring them up again.
[time=2352] Longstreet said that will be fine.
[time=2355] Just give it an hour or two and the battle will come to you.
[time=2359] You won't need to bring them up.
[time=2362] The battle will come to you.
[time=2365] Each of us are engaged in a civil war within ourselves.
[time=2369] There are two natures the old and the new and the battle is going to come.
[time=2374] There's no doubt about it.
[time=2376] Each of us will fight temptation again and again.
[time=2380] When a bishop was instructing Louis XIV in the teachings of the Apostle Paul he read to them.
[time=2388] The passage where Paul said there are two men within me.
[time=2392] The one who wants to do what God wants and I don't do that and the other who doesn't want to do what and I do it.
[time=2398] And he spoke about these two men and Louis XIV said to his tutor, "Ah, these two men, I know them well.
[time=2408] The battle will come.
[time=2410] Temptation will face each of us." One little guy understood that.
[time=2415] He was saving money to buy a baseball bat and he prayed this prayer.
[time=2419] God, help me to save my money to buy a new baseball bat and Lord, please don't let the ice cream man come down our street.
[time=2429] Temptation, we all face it.
[time=2432] Every one of us, but God's word gives us some great insights and principles how each of us can face temptation.
[time=2440] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 13 gives us four good principles about facing temptation.
[time=2448] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and just this one verse verse 13, "There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man.
[time=2460] But God is faithful who will not suffer or permit you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it."
[time=2477] If you're a new Christian, I think this is one verse of the Bible you would do well to memorize right away because it gives us at least four good principles that need to be a part of each of our thinking as we go through the adventure of the Christian life because the battle will come to you.
[time=2496] You don't have to go out and look for it.
[time=2499] It'll come.
[time=2500] Four principles.
[time=2502] The first principle is this one.
[time=2505] Temptation will come into your life.
[time=2511] No matter who you are, no matter how long you've been a believer in Christ, no matter how many Bible verses you've memorized, no matter how many bill gothard seminars you have been to, no matter how many Scofield notes you can quote backwards, you're going to face temptation.
[time=2528] It is an inevitable part of life.
[time=2533] And I found that maturity in Christ does not make the temptations go away.
[time=2539] As a matter of fact, the previous verse, verse 12, seems to indicate it's one we are at our best spiritually that we're the most prone to face temptation.
[time=2549] It says, "Let no one think, because I'm standing, I'll never fall."
[time=2555] It says, "Beware when you think you stand, that's when you'll fall." Spiritual temptation faced the greatest of men and women in the Bible.
[time=2565] The proof of that is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself who was tempted.
[time=2570] Hebrews chapter 4, verse 15 says these words.
[time=2575] It says, "We do not have a high priest who is not touched by our infirmities for our high priest, meaning Jesus Christ was tempted at every point just as we are except without sin."
[time=2593] That means that every point at which a human being can be tempted, Jesus was tempted at those points.
[time=2600] There wasn't anything that you're feeling or that you're facing that Jesus didn't face a similar temptation.
[time=2609] So spiritual maturity certainly is not a guarantee that you'll be able to avoid temptation.
[time=2615] It's going to pursue you.
[time=2617] As a matter of fact, the more mature you are in Christ, the more vulnerable you are.
[time=2622] Because you see, as we grow in Christ, we run the danger of becoming spiritually self-sufficient, which none of us are, but we think that.
[time=2633] It's when we're at our lowest that we're usually more aware of temptation and more dependent upon God to help us with temptation.
[time=2643] This passage begins by saying, "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man."
[time=2650] You've got to keep reading. It doesn't say there's no temptation taking you.
[time=2654] It is actually saying you're being tempted but your temptations are being described.
[time=2661] Temptation is an inevitable part of every one of our lives.
[time=2668] Let's take a moment to define the word though.
[time=2671] In our modern day English, when we hear the word temptation, most of us immediately think of the forbidden fruit or something that would be absolutely wrong for you to do.
[time=2681] I don't know what that is in your life, but if there is something that is clearly wrong, then temptation is some type of magnetic pull to do that which is forbidden.
[time=2691] But that's only half of the meaning of the word.
[time=2694] The actual word in the language of the New Testament is a neutral word. It is neither good nor is it bad.
[time=2702] It is just simply saying there is a trial, there is a test, there is a temptation.
[time=2709] It may be a test that is a positive test designed by God to prove your character and to strengthen your faith or the same word to me to describe to be a negative test, a solicitation to do evil.
[time=2727] The word itself is neutral and contains and envelops both of those concepts.
[time=2735] Now, there is a unique statement that Jesus made in the Lord's Prayer. Do you remember that about temptation?
[time=2743] He said, "Lord, lead us not into temptation."
[time=2751] Now, you can misunderstand that and say, "God's up there." And he knows every one of our weaknesses. He knows you are Achilles' heel. He knows your point of vulnerability.
[time=2762] He knows my weakness and so what God does is he dances and parades that weakness right in front of us and we're tempted every moment by this God that we have to plead saying, "Oh God, please stop the temptation."
[time=2779] That's not at all what it's saying.
[time=2782] The word temptation is a test, positive, or it could be a temptation negative.
[time=2790] Usually, they're the same event.
[time=2793] Let me illustrate that from the life of Jesus and then the life of Job.
[time=2798] Jesus was tempted by Satan, but God pre-arranged that. God allowed that to happen.
[time=2806] Why? Because that was a positive test to prove that Jesus was actually God and he was sinless.
[time=2814] It was a positive test of his character, but what Satan tried to do was to take that positive test and turn it into a negative temptation to bait him to do wrong.
[time=2826] The same thing's true in the life of Job. Do you remember the situation?
[time=2830] God and Satan are dialoguing.
[time=2833] God more or less brags about Job and his fine character and Satan says, "Yeah, but give me a week with him."
[time=2841] God, the only reason why Job likes you is you give him preferential treatment.
[time=2846] He's got everything a man could want. Well, sure he's going to love you.
[time=2850] You treat him so good, but God, if you didn't do that, you let me have him in no time. He'll fall.
[time=2859] So God designed a positive test and Satan tried to take that positive test and turn it into a negative temptation.
[time=2870] God allowed adversity and tragedy to hit his life.
[time=2875] Why? To prove his character and Satan got in there and tried to say, "Job, doubt God. Job, curse God. Job, be bitter. Job, get angry. Strike out."
[time=2895] And so when Jesus said, "Lead us not in the temptation," I think the right idea has been suggested as this.
[time=2902] God, please do not allow our test to lead into a temptation, but instead deliver us.
[time=2914] But the reality of every life here today and every life everywhere is that you and I are going to face tests
[time=2924] and trials and temptations.
[time=2928] And one of the great mistakes many people make is to think that I am somehow going to do something
[time=2934] that is going to make me above temptation and I'll never have to face it again.
[time=2939] And that, my friend, is the point where you are the most vulnerable because you think you're safe.
[time=2946] And that's when you're in the greatest danger. Principal number one is this, you will face temptation.
[time=2954] Principal number two, however, is a promise from God. It is this one.
[time=2960] You will not be uniquely tempted. I bet you've heard it. I've heard it. I've said it. That's why I've heard it.
[time=2970] Oh, brother, nobody knows how I feel. Isn't that common for us to say when the heat is really on?
[time=2979] To say, "Oh, man, this is bad. Nobody knows how I feel." Or to really become discouraged and say, "Nobody has ever had to face what I've got to face."
[time=2993] Well, the Bible says that's not true. It says, "No temptation has taken you, but what is common demand."
[time=3001] Meaning, it is a common human experience not only to face temptations, but whatever temptations
[time=3008] any of us individually are facing that is common to all humanity.
[time=3013] And it is a very, very dangerous thing for us to think. Nobody knows how I feel.
[time=3021] Nobody else has ever had to face this.
[time=3025] That's dangerous for two reasons. First of all, it's dangerous spiritually.
[time=3030] Why? Because if you say, "Nobody else has ever had to go through what I've had to go through."
[time=3036] You're saying, "God's a liar." And that's a position I'd like to avoid.
[time=3041] Because God says, "Your temptations are common to everyone." So it's dangerous spiritually, but secondly, it's dangerous emotionally.
[time=3050] Now, it's very natural for us to say, "Nobody knows how I feel."
[time=3056] Or, "Nobody else has had to face this." But remember, just because it's natural doesn't mean it's right.
[time=3062] As a matter of fact, the Bible says we have a natural spirit that is preconceived and predisposed towards sin.
[time=3071] And we've got to control the natural man by the spiritual man.
[time=3078] And as soon as we live with the mentality that nobody else has this, we're embarking upon a deep journey into the well of self-pity.
[time=3091] And you'll never be able to successfully face temptation while standing in the mire of self-pity.
[time=3098] Now, please don't misunderstand. I'm not trying to minimize the hurt that you're facing or depreciate the intensity of the trials that many of us have.
[time=3108] But I am saying, God has promised that you will not be uniquely tempted, that your temptations are going to come out of a base that's common to everyone else.
[time=3120] And if we had the time to leave through the pages of the Scripture, we would quickly discover that temptations of every kind are indeed common.
[time=3130] Joseph faced great temptations sexually, but he overcame it.
[time=3135] David faced the same temptation and fell.
[time=3139] People faced depression in the Bible.
[time=3143] Elijah was a terribly depressed man.
[time=3148] Peter suffered from a not-so-rare case of foot-and-mouth disease.
[time=3155] He faced that temptation.
[time=3157] There were people who faced the tragic loss of loved ones.
[time=3162] Ruth was a widow at a very young age.
[time=3165] There were those who lost their children like Naomi and David and Bathsheba.
[time=3170] There were those in the Bible who were falsely accused like Mary, the mother of our Lord.
[time=3177] There were those who had to lead a company of complaining Mongrels like Moses.
[time=3184] There were those that faced financial poverty like Lazarus the beggar.
[time=3190] There were those like diartophies who struggled with pride.
[time=3195] There were those like demons who faced materialism.
[time=3200] There's no temptation that's going to hit me or that's going to hit you, that all of humanity doesn't face on one day or another.
[time=3209] God has promised you that He will not allow you to be uniquely tempted.
[time=3214] Here's the third principle, another promise from God.
[time=3218] God promises that you will not be tempted beyond your ability to successfully endure.
[time=3227] God will not allow anyone of us to be faced with a temptation that the immensity,
[time=3234] the enormity is greater than our ability to face.
[time=3238] And you know this is an unconditional promise of God.
[time=3242] What do I mean by unconditional?
[time=3244] Well, conditional promise has two words in it.
[time=3247] If, then, here's a conditional promise.
[time=3251] If you will cut my grass, I'll help you weed your garden.
[time=3255] But I didn't promise to help you weed your garden unconditionally.
[time=3260] I said if, but look at verse 13.
[time=3265] Is anybody seeing if?
[time=3269] It's not there, is it?
[time=3271] That's an unconditional promise.
[time=3273] God says, I don't care what you do, I don't care who you are, I'm going to give you a promise.
[time=3278] That promise is this.
[time=3281] I will not allow you to be tempted above your ability to endure and to handle.
[time=3289] And all that's based upon the very person of God, that God is first of all faithful.
[time=3295] That's how this all begins.
[time=3297] It says, but God is faithful and He will not permit it to happen.
[time=3301] Now there are two characters of God, characteristics of God described there, explicitly that He's faithful, that you can trust Him, and implicitly that He's powerful because He says He will not permit it.
[time=3314] That means He's in control.
[time=3316] Now here's a second temptation that most of us face.
[time=3319] In the middle of a test, in the face of a temptation, for us to say, I can't take it.
[time=3327] I just can't handle it anymore.
[time=3330] Well I've said that too often.
[time=3333] And again to say that I can't handle it, or I can't take it, is again spiritually dangerous for the same reason.
[time=3341] We're saying one of three things.
[time=3343] One, God is a liar because He said, you can handle it, and I said I can't handle it.
[time=3349] God, you lied.
[time=3351] Or two, we're saying God, you didn't lie, but you're not faithful.
[time=3356] You said it, and now you didn't live up to it while you're an unfaithful character.
[time=3362] Or three, God, you said it, and you really meant it.
[time=3365] You're a faithful guy, but God, you're too weak.
[time=3367] You couldn't handle my circumstances.
[time=3372] I never thought of that.
[time=3373] All these years I've been blubbering, I can't take it.
[time=3376] I wonder how God felt about that when He said, oh yes you can.
[time=3381] Oh yes you can.
[time=3384] And again it is emotionally dangerous to say I can't take it because that's assuming a position of self defeat, and you'll never win when your mind and your emotions and your will say I'm going to lose.
[time=3398] You'll never win.
[time=3401] I'm not trying to flame the flame, flames of artificial enthusiasm, but I'm here looking at what God calls a promise in His Word, that He will not allow us to be tempted above what we're able.
[time=3415] Matthew Henry put it this way.
[time=3417] Though it is displeasing for God for us to presume, it is also not pleasing to Him for us to despair.
[time=3426] Either our trials will be proportioned to our strength, or our strength will be proportioned to our temptation.
[time=3435] And then here's a fourth principle.
[time=3438] God promises that He will help us as we face temptation.
[time=3445] It says this, God is faithful who will not permit you to be tempted above what you're able, but with the temptation also make a way of escape
[time=3458] that you might be able to bear it.
[time=3461] What God is saying is when a temptation comes into your life, although God didn't send that temptation because He can't be tempted with evil and He doesn't tempt anyone else, He says I'll come and I will give you a way of escape.
[time=3476] Now don't say Jim Dandy to the rescue, blow the bugle, here comes the Calvary, we're getting raptured out of this.
[time=3483] It doesn't say an escape from, but an escape through.
[time=3488] Most of us to get by our temptations will have to go through them, but God promises to help you.
