[time=1626] Why have you chosen me out of millions,
[time=1634] your child to be?
[time=1637] You know all the wrong that I've done.
[time=1648] Oh, how could you pardon me?
[time=1655] Forgive my iniquity to save me if Jesus your son.
[time=1671] But, Lord, help me be what you want me to be.
[time=1683] For word I will strive to obey.

[time=1729] is willing and wanting to bless.
[time=1741] His grace is so wonderful.
[time=1747] His mercy is so bountiful.
[time=1752] I can't understand it.
[time=1757] I confess.

[time=1774] Your word I will strive to obey.
[time=1786] My life I now give.

[time=1814] For you I will live.
[time=1820] And walk by your side all the way.
[time=1857] Thank you, ladies.
[time=1860] If you have your Bible with you today, I want to invite you to open it to the book of 1 Corinthians and the 10th chapter.
[time=1868] If you are new or visiting Black Hawk or watching us for the first time today,
[time=1874] it is our philosophy of ministry to study the Bible.
[time=1878] I know there are many wise people today who have a great deal of information, but there is none so wise as God.
[time=1887] As a matter of fact, the Bible says the wisdom of man does not even begin to approach the foolishness of God.
[time=1894] And that's not to say that God is foolish, it's just his simplest thought is above our most grand imagination.
[time=1900] And he has given us his word and it is God's word.
[time=1904] And because he is timeless, he gives to us timeless principles for life.
[time=1910] I don't know of any part of the Bible that is more practical and contemporary than Corinthians.
[time=1916] The problems that the Corinthians faced seem like this week's edition of Time magazine.
[time=1922] And Chuck Swindall preached through this a number of years ago.
[time=1925] He called 1 Corinthians 1 Californians because when you read it, it sounds like California.
[time=1933] And usually when California sneezes, Fort Wayne catches a cold.
[time=1937] We tend to look to the west coast and catch every good or bad thing that happens out there.
[time=1943] So we today have the privilege of reading God's word.
[time=1946] If you have a Bible, I will read for us today from the King James edition of 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 14 through 22.
[time=1955] "Wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry."
[time=1961] I speak as to wise men judge you what I say.
[time=1967] The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
[time=1975] The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
[time=1983] For we, being many, are one bread and one body.
[time=1989] For we are all partakers of that one bread.
[time=1995] Behold Israel, after the flesh, are not they who eat of the sacrifices,
[time=2002] partakers of the altar?
[time=2005] What say I then?
[time=2007] That the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?
[time=2017] But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God.
[time=2027] For I would not that you should have fellowship with demons.
[time=2033] You cannot drink of the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
[time=2037] You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of demons.
[time=2045] Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
[time=2049] Are we stronger than he 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 14 through 22?
[time=2057] This passage falls into the context of three chapters, chapters 8, 9 and 10,
[time=2063] which are trying to give some insight and principles into an old problem that is relevant today.
[time=2069] Now their old problem was this.
[time=2072] They were Corinthians who had a new life in Christ but who lived in the old city of Corinth.
[time=2078] And there were a lot of things that were happening in Corinth that people just expected that you're a part of the community.
[time=2084] You'll be a part of these activities.
[time=2087] And the Christians were saying wow, I don't know.
[time=2091] How does my commitment to Jesus Christ fit into this society that I'm a part of?
[time=2097] Well some incorrectly thought that they don't fit so I'll just take off and I'll live in a monastery up in the mountains and I'll get away from society.
[time=2106] Paul never by the inspiration of God meant for us to abdicate our responsibilities in society and find a safe place of hiding.
[time=2116] But he meant for us to have a unique walk as a believer in a troubled world.
[time=2121] And that hasn't changed at all.
[time=2123] Now their dilemma was basically this.
[time=2126] All of life centered around their temples.
[time=2131] Everything in life centered there.
[time=2134] The temple was not only the place of community worship, it was also the place of community form.
[time=2141] So if there were political views to be expressed in that day, the temple was that seat of opportunity.
[time=2148] If there were cultural events that were happening independent of religion, this auditorium would be used for those cultural events.
[time=2157] But more than anything else, the temple was the city's hot spot.
[time=2162] Court not only had the famous temple of Aphrodite that was on the highest hill, but they had dozens of others, little temples.
[time=2171] And these basically served as night clubs.
[time=2174] That's really what they were.
[time=2176] The temple was a place where you could go to and there the city would afford every pleasure that it had.
[time=2183] And so if you had nothing to do in the night time, the temple was the place to go.
[time=2188] I mean that's where it was happening in Corinth, and you sure don't want to miss it.
[time=2194] Now largely the religious part of this whole affair were sacrifices made to the pagan god or goddess.
[time=2203] Then there was a dilemma.
[time=2205] Actually not a dilemma, there were three.
[time=2207] The first dilemma was this, many times people would hold a banquet at the pagan temple and invite you to come.
[time=2215] This banquet may be to celebrate a new business.
[time=2219] This banquet may be in honor of the good year they've had financially and they're bringing in all of their clients.
[time=2225] This may be more of a family reunion.
[time=2228] It could be any number of things.
[time=2230] And so the host would go, go to the priest, bring an animal, sacrifice it to this god or goddess.
[time=2238] And then part of the meat would be taken by the priest as his financial renumeration.
[time=2244] And the other part of it would be given back to the person who requested the sacrifice.
[time=2250] And that meat's now used for this big banquet.
[time=2253] And the banquet would begin like this.
[time=2257] The meat would be ceremony presented around a table where all the guests were gathered.
[time=2262] And the host or hostess would rise and thank the guests for coming and say, "We meet here tonight in honor of our great goddess Aphrodite."
[time=2273] And the meat that we now serve you has been dedicated to her.
[time=2277] And this chair that is empty is for her that she might be our guest of honor.
[time=2282] Now my friends, eat, drink and worship and enjoy our goddess Aphrodite.
[time=2290] How do you fit in as a new Christian?
[time=2294] How do you handle that?
[time=2296] Well, after you handle that problem, how do you handle this problem?
[time=2300] You're over at the neighbor's house.
[time=2302] They're new.
[time=2303] You're just getting acquainted with them.
[time=2305] They've been to your house now.
[time=2306] They've had you back and they have got the most beautiful rump roast you have ever seen.
[time=2311] Right there in front of you.
[time=2313] You miss lunch.
[time=2314] It was a busy day.
[time=2316] He takes out this knife and he says, "How big a piece would you like me to cut?"
[time=2322] And you just discreetly mentioned, "Well, you're kind of hungry because you miss lunch." And you see that knife move down just a little further.
[time=2329] He's going to cut you a bigger piece.
[time=2331] He said, "This is good meat." Would you like a little more?" And he said, "Well, sure, after all, you know, yeah, I'd like a real big piece." That's good because this is good meat.
[time=2341] I just got it from the priest.
[time=2343] We sacrificed this to Aphrodite.
[time=2345] Well, I'm a vegetarian.
[time=2348] I forgot to tell you that.
[time=2350] Now, how do you handle that dilemma?
[time=2353] Well, let's just even make it simpler because they had a third problem.
[time=2356] You're walking through the marketplace.
[time=2359] And ground beef is going for six deneria pound.
[time=2363] That's high.
[time=2364] Inflation's bad.
[time=2365] But right over here, across the street, you can get it for half the price.
[time=2368] It was just sacrificed last night.
[time=2370] It's fresh.
[time=2371] It's good.
[time=2372] Do you buy it?
[time=2373] You say, "Well, we don't have those problems." No, but don't you, I do, struggle with how do I fit my faith into Jesus Christ into a world that lives in a fast lane?
[time=2385] And I mean, is it all right to get on the freeway?
[time=2388] Well, okay, if you can get on the freeway, how long do you stay on it?
[time=2391] I mean, do you have to get off at the next exit?
[time=2393] Are you allowed to move into the center lane and really get on the floor with the traffic?
[time=2397] I don't know how to handle all those things, but God's got some principles for us here.
[time=2403] In the verses that we've just read today, everything that was said in verses 14 through 22 are actually in reference to a pagan feast at a pagan temple.
[time=2416] Say, "How do you know that, Hawks?" And never once does it say feast or temple there, well, there's one word that creeps up down in verse 21 that gives us a clue.
[time=2427] It says, "You cannot drink of the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
[time=2432] You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of demons." When he's talking about the Lord's table, he means when we sit down as believers in Christ and we remember Christ's death through what we call communion.
[time=2445] That's the Lord's table.
[time=2446] Often we'll say, "This older, this is the Lord's table." And when you go to the pagan temple, there was a big banqueting table, and that was the temple of the patron God or goddess of that community.
[time=2457] Now, in verses 23 and following, he changes it to, "Is it appropriate to buy meat that's been sacrificed in the marketplace?"
[time=2466] But today, we're just talking about this feast.
[time=2469] Now, let me identify three words for you to help us piece this all together.
[time=2474] The first word is found in verse 14.
[time=2476] It's a command.
[time=2478] It says, "Flee idolatry." Now, most of us, when we hear the word idolatry, we say, "Yeah, worshiping idols." I remember seeing national geographic, and they got all these different idols that people worship.
[time=2492] Perhaps you were privileged to do something I was doing, going to a foreign mission field, and there you see all the different idols that people worship.
[time=2500] It amazed me in sophisticated Japan. They're shaking a stick over their truck to cast all the evil spirits away, and I'm going, "Wow, this is strange."
[time=2509] And we have this tendency, "Well, idolatry." Yeah, that's why we send missionaries to those other places, but we don't have idols here in our country.
[time=2518] I'm not so sure.
[time=2520] Listen to the first three of the famous ten commandments.
[time=2525] The first says, "Thou shall have no other gods before me." The second says, "Thou shall not make in any graven image and bow down the worship pit."
[time=2535] That's our concept of idolatry.
[time=2538] And the third says, "Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." What those three of the ten commandments are doing is they're trying to establish to us the exclusive role of God in our life.
[time=2552] That nothing is to be ahead of him, and nothing is to be propped up as a substitute for him.
[time=2560] Because anything that takes the place of God in our life is a substitute becomes an idol, whether it's carved out of wood or it's totally abstract.
[time=2570] That has become the idol of our life.
[time=2573] And now he says to these Corinthians, "They are to flee from idolatry."
[time=2579] He's basically saying to them, "Don't go to these feasts in a pagan temple because once you return to the nightlife of Corinth, it'll sink its hooks into you when one place or another, and you'll find yourself being pulled right into it."
[time=2594] It says, "No Paul is saying, 'I know you're not going for religious purposes.'" He says, "I know that an idol is nothing.
[time=2601] However, the society that is a part of that whole thing will bait you and gradually pull you in and pull you away from your commitment to Christ."
[time=2612] Now there's a second word that we need to identify, and I've already mentioned it.
[time=2616] It's the word "table." To the ancients and to many cultures today, to sit around someone's table and to eat with them is definitive of the most intimate of relationships.
[time=2630] And for the most part, we try to eat with people we like, don't we?
[time=2634] I mean, if you've got a hostile phone call, and this guy really was chewing on you and said, "I'm just sick of the way you do business, and I just want you to know you're going to be hearing from my attorney about this, and I'll see you in court."
[time=2648] You probably won't respond by saying, "Okay, why don't you and the missus come over tonight and I'll call my wife and we'll just eat and have a good time."
[time=2657] We don't do that with our adversaries.
[time=2660] It's our friends that we invite to our table.
[time=2664] Because that's a sign of intimacy.
[time=2667] While we were in Japan, we stayed with a lovely Japanese couple, the Horiuchi's.
[time=2673] I don't expect you to be able to say that.
[time=2675] It took me a week of living in their house to say it.
[time=2678] But we stayed with them, but we were always on the go.
[time=2681] And towards the end of the week, we had grown very close to them, and they to us.
[time=2686] And Mrs. Horiuchi, through an interpreter, said that Kathy didn't look like she was making it too well on the raw squid, and that she would fix her a meal to faten her bones.
[time=2696] So we sat down for the purpose of bone-fatening at the Horiuchi table.
[time=2702] They helped us by eating at an American table.
[time=2705] Most of the meals we sat down on our knees.
[time=2708] But we sat down at this table, and noticed something.
[time=2712] You had a dish, but your dish was about half the size of what you and I would call a saucer for your teacup.
[time=2719] And there was this big bowl in the middle.
[time=2722] Mr. Horiuchi said, "We are Japanese." I knew that much.
[time=2727] He said, "But we eat as a family out of one bowl, and I hope you do not mind that as a family we out of one bowl."
[time=2735] And then in a tender moment, he looked at us and said, "And you are our family. You can eat from our bowl."
[time=2743] And as an American, I didn't really understand what he was saying by way of commitment to us personally.
[time=2750] But he was saying, "We accept you, and we want you to be a part of not only this table, but in Japan our bowl."
[time=2757] Because you see to them, that was a sign of complete identification.
[time=2762] And that's how it was in Corinth. Paul says, "When you sit down at the Lord's table, you're completely identifying with Jesus Christ."
[time=2771] And when you sit down at that pagan temple, you're completely identifying with that pagan.
[time=2777] So the table was a sign of great intimacy.
[time=2781] Now there's a third word. It's the word "demons." That's a buzz word. We can at least make a movie out of it.
[time=2788] When you and I think of demons, we probably have been programmed from Biblical and other sources to think of demons are those things which possess people in Africa.
[time=2800] And occasionally in the Western world, and if a person is influenced by a demon, their body begins to do all kinds of strange things.
[time=2809] Their voice lowers two octaves below the piano, and they begin to make these word sounds.
[time=2815] Well, I'm not trying to make light of all that because there's an element of truth to all that, but that's not really the accurate picture.
[time=2824] First of all, demons I really do believe exist. Where did they come from?
[time=2831] Well, there are two theories. I believe that demons are those angels that united with Lucifer in a rebellion against God.
[time=2842] And when God threw them literally out of heaven, they rallied around their leader Lucifer and are now fallen angels which are also called in the Bible demons.
[time=2854] Now to give fair time to the other side, there's a different belief that says in Genesis 6, it says that the sons of God cohabitated with the daughters of men.
[time=2865] And so some interpret that the sons of God are angels because they're occasionally called sons of God in the Bible.
[time=2871] And they came to earth, looked like human beings, married or perhaps illegitimately fathered children of human wives.
[time=2880] And so now you had these critters, half human and half angelic in the world, and there were giants in Noah's day.
[time=2889] And so those critters called Nephilim in Hebrew were actually these half angels, half human beings, and then the flood came.
[time=2897] And all the people died, but there were these Nephilim, these giants, these critters, and when their bodies died because they weren't human beings, they didn't go to heaven or hell, they were wandering spirits and became demons.
[time=2911] It is amazing how all these verses fit together, but I don't see that. I think they're fallen angels.
[time=2918] But whichever theology you enjoy, the Bible does teach the reality that there are spirit beings in league with Satan who are working and what's their purpose.
[time=2930] I believe their purpose is the same as the purpose of Satan which is twofold.
[time=2935] First of all, Satan is an imitator of God. What did Satan want to do? Why did he fall? Because he said, "I want to be God."
[time=2943] What was the temptation he gave Adam and Eve to be like God? Satan's number one plan is to imitate God.
[time=2952] So be careful. If someone reports a miracle, don't instantly say, "Well praise God, a miracle."
[time=2958] Satan's been doing miracles for years. For years. Read about Simon who wanted to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2968] He had a whole racket going because through his satanic power he was producing miracles.
[time=2974] Why? Because his plan is to imitate God and secondly his plan is to deceive people.
[time=2982] That's what Satan is all about. He is simply trying to deceive all of humanity so that we will be following anything other than God.
[time=2993] To my knowledge, Satan is not particularly concerned what it is that you or I worship as long as it's not God.
[time=3001] He's not particularly concerned what you believe in or what I believe in as long as it's not God's Son Jesus Christ.
[time=3008] And so what he is going to do is he is going to front all types of philosophies, all types of religion, all types of opportunities.
[time=3018] He's going to front those to you so that you will say, "This looks good so I can buy that. Sounds good to me."
[time=3028] And he's never once going to let it appear satanic or demonic because he doesn't necessarily want us to worship him.
[time=3034] He just doesn't want us to worship God and he doesn't want us necessarily to believe in his power but he doesn't want us to believe in the power of Jesus Christ to give new and eternal life.
[time=3047] Now let me just put this all back together. I've kind of broken down words. Let me just put it back together in Paul's reasoning.
[time=3056] First thing he says is a command. It's a principle and he says, "Get away from idolatry." He's saying, "Don't go to the big pagan shindigs."
[time=3066] No matter how many people they say he's going to be there, stay away from it, flee from it. Don't go sit at that table.
[time=3074] Now why does he say that? Well his reasoning builds this way. First of all in verse 16 he says, "When you come to the Lord's table, the word communion has a real meaning."
[time=3085] The communion is an abstract word to most of us. When we hear the word communion we think it means a little cup that everybody gets one and a little cracker and everybody gets one of those.
[time=3097] But the word communion has a root meaning that means come with union to be together. It means to be together with Christ.
[time=3108] And when we have communion we are identifying ourselves with Christ. Verse 17 goes on and says, "And when I identify myself with Christ, and when you mark identify with Christ, and when you share it, and all of us identify in communion, then we're identifying with each other because we're one body in Christ."
[time=3130] Verse 18 he says, "That was true in the Old Testament with the Hebrew sacrifices." And so he now says in verses 19, 20, and 21 simply this, "You cannot on Sunday go to the church and identify with Christ, and fellowship with Him, and commune with Him around His table, and go on Monday night to the pagan temple, and identify with it."
[time=3156] You can't do both. God says there's a line that I am drawing because I'm a jealous God. I know in our society we can note that jealousy is bad.
[time=3168] But jealousy is neither good nor bad. Jealousy simply says that I have a protective role that I am taking.
[time=3180] Now, if I am jealous that I am taking a self-protective role that I want what you have, and I'd like what you have, and boy, I want all those things. That's wrong.
[time=3192] But they simply say, "This has value, and I'm going to protect it." That's good. I hope you're jealous of your children.
[time=3200] I hope that as you raise your children, you're jealous that you don't let anybody touch them.
[time=3206] I hope you're jealous of your children. You don't let anybody just come in and pump their philosophy into their heads. That's a good jealousy.
[time=3214] God says, "My name and my character are above every name, and I'm jealous enough that I'm going to protect my name and character, and don't you ever elevate anything up to that level, and don't you ever do anything that pollutes and dilutes what I am."
[time=3231] Now, how do we boil this all down to some practical application for 1986? Let me suggest these principles.
[time=3240] Principle number one is this. Idolatry is still a part of our society today.
[time=3246] No, you can't go down to the department store here and buy your little idol like you can, and so go Japan. Can't do that here.
[time=3256] But you know, there are at least these four idols that we worship regularly.
[time=3262] First idol that we worship in no particular order is the idol of possessions.
[time=3268] The second, the idol of power. The third, the idol of prestige. And fourth, the idol of pleasure.
[time=3281] That's what we worship here in America, in Fort Wayne. We worship those four idols. Power, pleasure, prestige, and possessions.
[time=3295] How do I call those an idol? Because you see, they are the voices that call us that force us to say yes to them and no to God.
[time=3307] I enjoy television and I have no special acts to grind. Do you ever watch some of the 15 to 30 second promos of shows like Dallas, Dynasty, and that whole gamut?
[time=3318] It's almost like the announcer comes on and says, "See it tonight. Sex, power, greed, lust, have it all."
[time=3324] And you go, "Wow, you know, great. I can't wait to see it." But that's really the basic philosophy of our society.
[time=3333] And how do we order our life? We order our life so I can possess a little more.
[time=3338] We order our life so we can have a little bit more prestige.
[time=3353] How do you order your life?
[time=3356] I find myself constantly fighting a battle because society's got its hooks under my skin too.
[time=3366] You know, our world is as adults a lot like our kids, isn't it?
[time=3371] We poured a whole pile of dirt in our driveway a couple of years ago.
[time=3377] And a pile of dirt attracts kids like a human magnet.
[time=3381] I mean, it was like somebody tipped the cul-de-sac and every kid under ten ended up in our driveway.
[time=3386] Now, the Hawkses have got a dirt pile, you know, and they attacked.
[time=3389] And you just saw these little urchins climbing the mountain.
[time=3393] And one guy gets to the top and he pushes somebody down and I'm king of the mountain.
[time=3398] You know what that sounds a lot? It sounds like the corporate world.
[time=3402] You know, we get behind our mahogany desks and we climb and we say, "I want to be king of the mountain.
[time=3409] I want to be the guy that pushes the yes and the no buttons in this organization.
[time=3414] I want that kind of power. I want the name "President" right behind mine.
[time=3425] But I don't think there's anything wrong with being glory in it.
[time=3429] And I'd love to see each of you at the top, but just make sure that you're striving for the top.
[time=3437] It's totally second to your spiritual commitments to Jesus Christ.
[time=3444] And if your job or if your pursuit of power or your pursuit of possessions
[time=3450] ever forces you to say no when God wants you to say yes while you're in trouble.
[time=3456] You're in serious trouble.
[time=3459] And the reason why I can say all of that is because I am a fellow struggler.
[time=3466] My adultery is still a part of our society.
[time=3469] A second principle that I would share with you is this one.
[time=3473] Demons still are working today.
[time=3476] 2 Corinthians 11, 14 says they're like angels of light.
[time=3480] That means they don't come and say everybody who wants to be shaken in convulsions meet in this room and meet your friendly demon.
[time=3487] Now what they do is they front for things that look good.
[time=3491] And most of the philosophy of this world is inspired by the influences of Satan and his demons.
[time=3513] The special music today that you've heard and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks has been designed to introduce you to our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3522] You've made a decision today concerning your spiritual life.
[time=3525] I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you.
[time=3528] Will you bow your heads and pray?
[time=3530] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3538] I sense today that I need you to come into my heart to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3544] And I ask you to come into my life today.
[time=3547] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3552] If you've made a recent decision, will you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
