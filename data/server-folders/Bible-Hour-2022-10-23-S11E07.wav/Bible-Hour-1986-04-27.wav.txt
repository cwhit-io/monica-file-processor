[time=111] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=113] Now, from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=128] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=131] (music)
[time=195] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=197] At Christmas, we sing, "Oh, come all ye faithful."
[time=204] Oh, come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant.
[time=209] Today we come as faithful, joyful and triumphant in Jesus Christ because He is alive,
[time=216] and we have come to worship Him this morning.
[time=219] We welcome you to this service and trust that today you've come with an open heart to express, out of your heart, with its doors open, a flowing of your love for the Lord Jesus.
[time=230] And yet an openness, too, that He, by His Spirit, by song and His Word, might speak to you today.
[time=236] Thank you for joining us and welcome to those friends who now have us in their homes or perhaps their hospital room or even their prison through the Bible Hour.
[time=245] We trust that today God will minister to each of us and that we might see, above everything else, the Lord Jesus.
[time=253] There's coming a day when we will see Him face to face when He comes.
[time=257] Our choir will sing of that truth for us even now.

[time=897] Thank you, Marsha. Perhaps in your life this week, God allowed some rain to come. A pleasant experience some days,
[time=908] a difficult one at other days, but it's part of the growing, the stretching of life. But I hope this morning, the power that we have together brings a sunshine in your life of confidence in the Lord Jesus. In just a few moments, we'll have a choral reading of Scripture from a group from our speech class here at Blackhawk Christian School. But before they come, I would like to add my own personal thanks and encouragement about Blackhawk Christian School. When I was a high school student, nearly 20 years ago now, a Christian school had just begun in our community, and I even for a moment gave some consideration to going there. But in those days, you had to make a choice. Would you choose for Christian education or would you choose for quality education? But the thing that I'm so excited about is today, it's not an either or choice. Here at Blackhawk Christian School and at other Christian schools, you do not have to sacrifice quality to receive a Christian education. By God's grace and the hard, hard work of faculty and administrators, Blackhawk Christian School is indeed able to provide quality education on a biblical foundation so that our students have the freedom to come where God's word is being honored, his principles are being taught, and yet there is not a sacrifice on the quality of the education. You've heard it said before and I'll repeat it just briefly that our students have been accepted to universities at every level for every possible degree. Our students have been received into engineering programs at very prestigious schools. They've been accepted into public education. They've been received into private education, Christian and secular schools alike, and they have fared well. They have fared very well because of the preparation they have had. There's not a choice any longer that you have to make between Christian and quality. By God's grace, we have both here. Then there is
[time=1036] the advantage that a Christian school has of developing character and the commitment to God's word. We teach an integrated curriculum.
[time=1046] By integration, we mean that we take science and biology and geology teach. We take what history and English and drama teach and we filter it through God's word so that there's not disparity between what we believe is a Christian and what we hold academically, that the two are integrated. There is that philosophy of life that is taught that is thoroughly Christian and that is so critical because you see Christianity is always one generation away from extinction. God has no
[time=1080] grandchildren. The only people to carry the flag for Jesus Christ into the
[time=1087] future is the next generation. Christian education allows us to equip that next generation to be as effective for Jesus Christ as we possibly can. I believe it was C.S. Lewis who said being born into a Christian family does not make you a Christian any more than being born in a garage makes you a car. You see there has to be a transformation of a life, a commitment
[time=1113] to Jesus Christ that's totally personal and then there has to be the development of those people to be the leaders for Christ in the next generation and the Christian school stands as a paramount avenue of developing that generation of leaders to face the adventure for Christ in the future.
[time=1131] It's been a number of years ago as Kathy and I would consider where it would be that God would have us to serve. Many factors came into that process of decision but as a part of that decision to be a part of this community was Black Hawk Christian school. It certainly wasn't the only factor but I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say it was a major one. This was a place where we saw that our children could best grow in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord. Thank you for the privilege of serving here at Black Hawk and thank you for a school that trains our children so well. This year we have our oldest daughter in kindergarten she'll be in first grade next year she's very academically minded a very serious student. Next year our second student will come pray for the school. She is not academically minded nor is she serious she has my blood and temperament flowing through her and pray for kindergarten next year it'll be a real experience. We're so thankful for this school for this body of people to serve you. One of our groups of students have learned the scripture and a way to present them with such clarity. We want you to know more than anything else Jesus Christ is alive and that you can know him personally. The scripture declares the event of the resurrection. Listen to our students as they present a scripture reading dramatically.
[time=1214] And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice he gave up his spirit at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn into from tap to bottom. The earth
[time=1225] shook and the rock split. The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people
[time=1231] who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs and after Jesus resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. When the centurion and those with him who were regarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened they were terrified and exclaimed surely he was the son of God.
[time=1253] He is dead. He is dead.
[time=1257] After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and any other
[time=1267] Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled away the stone and sat upon it. The men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not
[time=1283] here. He has risen. Then they remembered his words. He is risen. He is risen.
[time=1291] So the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to
[time=1300] tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. Greetings he said. They came to him
[time=1306] clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus sent to them. Do not be afraid.
[time=1313] Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me. He is alive. He is
[time=1319] alive. Why seek He the living among the dead? He is alive. Why seek He the living
[time=1326] among the dead? He is alive. He is alive. He is alive.
[time=1332] I sincerely hope that what you have seen and heard so far today has been a real
[time=1348] strength to your spiritual life. I think each of us need a time of encouragement
[time=1354] and input. We certainly are trusting that God is using this broadcast in your life to that end. Pete, Kathy and I had a great time of input this week in Columbus, Ohio. Many of the people there like Don Wertzen and Christine Wertzen ask us to say hello to you. Well we appreciate all of those people in their ministry. They have a very, very demanding ministry as they go from place to place.
[time=1378] It is not like us working here every weekend but they really have quite a great schedule and I do appreciate their ministry. They write well, they sing well and they are a spiritual blessing to all of us. That they are but they feel that same way towards you and I do too and want to thank you for the great work that you do here musically. Well thank you Rick. I particularly appreciated the month of emphasis on our Christian school too. We saw musicians from the elementary school and the speaking choir today and it's just really exciting to see all of the outlets that we have for Christian service right within our Christian school.
[time=1413] It is great. Speaking of music and events coming up May the 18th is a very special night here at Blackhawk. That's going to be an exciting time Rick.
[time=1421] You know for many months now really we've had the music. We got it back in August. They are ten tunes that were arranged by Don Marsh and Rick. We've put them now on record. That record will be released on May 18th.
[time=1434] That's at 6 p.m. here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church. We're going to have the premier concert. It is a great record not only because of the workmanship by our choir but also the spiritual content of the music really is inspiring. I've listened to the test pressing a number of times and I would like to invite everyone to come and celebrate with us.
[time=1454] We're titling it a celebration of praise and it's going to be a great time here May 18th at 6 p.m. Well I've certainly enjoyed listening to the preparation and preparation music that Kathy's been singing around the house and are excited both of us to see that concert coming on May the 18th and we want to encourage you to join us. If you do not have a Sunday evening service we would love to have you join us any night but particularly May the 18th as we celebrate through music and our album has been prepared by our choir and we're looking forward to previewing that for you. We want to say a special word of welcome and thank you and thank you to a large group of people who join us today for the Bible hour and stay with us for six months. The time changed in Ohio and so instead of our broadcast coming on at 11 o'clock there it's coming on at noon and many of you are home from church and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1507] Pete please share the booklet we have for this morning.
[time=1511] We've been offering to our guests the booklet entitled Beginning Your New Life in the Spirit. When you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior there are certain principles by which you may live the Christian life.
[time=1523] The booklet talks about the natural man, the carnal man and the spiritual man and I would encourage you if you especially if you've just accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior you will write for this booklet today. It helps you get started in your spiritual walk with God. You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1551] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1559] Thank you again for joining us today for the Bible hour.
[time=1563] As we go back to the live part of our morning worship service, Brian Losin will be ministering to us in music and then we'll be studying principles from God's Word. I hope you have both an open Bible and open heart. Open your heart to the Lord and please open your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 that we can study together.
[time=1583] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1605] His peace runs deeper than our fears.
[time=1617] If we go to Him for mercy
[time=1623] our hearts can rest assured.
[time=1629] His love will keep us through our tears.
[time=1641] He'll give us strength to simply trust Him.
[time=1657] Through times we may not understand.
[time=1669] We will gain a calm assurance.
[time=1675] Passing doubt can dim our lives
[time=1687] are safely in His hand.
[time=1695] Though countless souls have come to Him so desperate and lost
[time=1709] with faith no greater than a tiny seed.
[time=1721] Each one has found a wondrous truth beneath his single cross.
[time=1737] His grace is greater than our needs.
[time=1751] No heart or depth in all creation
[time=1763] can reach beyond his love for me.
[time=1773] And his power has raised my spirit
[time=1779] our work forever done
[time=1787] with grace.
[time=1793] His power has raised my spirit
[time=1799] our work forever done
[time=1809] His grace is greater
[time=1821] His grace is greater than my needs.
[time=1843] Thank you Brian, and thank you Lord that your grace is greater than our need.
[time=1852] God please put within the heart of each one of us the confidence of not only that song but of your very word.
[time=1859] As you spoke to Paul and said my grace is sufficient for thee.
[time=1865] God may we today find in you and in your measurement of grace to our lives
[time=1871] a sense of sufficiency not in and of ourselves but in you.
[time=1877] God your word says that my God saw supply all of your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[time=1887] God we would pray today that your grace would be abundant upon the hearts of many
[time=1893] of those who have lost loved ones in recent days and weeks the family of Carol Watson, for Donna Christian the carpenters and others who in the last weeks have lost loved ones we pray that your grace would be sufficient.
[time=1909] God we would pray today for grace for those whose homes have been broken by
[time=1915] infidelity, by abuse, by hearts that have grown bitter
[time=1921] that you would give grace today to that believer to repair relationships
[time=1928] to forgive those who aren't even asking for forgiveness nor seeking to change
[time=1934] we pray that your grace would be sufficient.
[time=1937] We pray today for those who are married to a husband or wife who believes not
[time=1944] that you would teach them to walk winsome towards that unbeliever that they might without a word draw them to Christ we pray that your grace would be sufficient.
[time=1956] Father today we would ask for that family who has a son or a daughter perhaps in their teens or some even older who are not walking with you that you would give grace to that parent and conviction to that young person that would draw them to Christ we would pray that your grace would be sufficient.
[time=1979] God today we would pray that as we open our hearts that you would plant a word of grace within us that could spring up into a hope and expectation in life.
[time=1992] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=1997] Open your Bibles please and study with us if you would from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verses 23 through chapter 11 verse 1.
[time=2011] In this passage the Apostle Paul sums up his comments about handling those things in the middle.
[time=2018] God has clearly said these things you must do.
[time=2022] God said these things you must not do but there's obviously some ground in the middle.
[time=2030] Paul has been speaking for three chapters on that.
[time=2034] Today we begin his final conclusions.
[time=2038] Verse 23, "All things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient.
[time=2046] All things are lawful for me but all things do not edify.
[time=2054] Let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth." Whatever is sold in the market, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
[time=2067] For the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=2072] If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go, whatever is set before you eat,
[time=2082] asking no question for conscience sake.
[time=2086] But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice and to idols, eat not.
[time=2094] For his sake that showed it and for his conscience sake.
[time=2101] For the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=2105] Conscience I say, not thine own but of the other.
[time=2110] For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience?
[time=2115] Or if I by grace be partaker, why am I evil spoken of?
[time=2120] For that for which I give thanks?
[time=2125] Whether therefore you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=2134] Give no offense neither to the Jew nor to the Greeks nor to the Church of God.
[time=2140] Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit,
[time=2146] but the profit of many that they may be saved.
[time=2152] Be ye followers of me, even as I also am a follower of Christ.
[time=2161] In this there are a number of principles, but the bottom line is a principle today
[time=2167] to be committed to Christ and others more than ourselves.
[time=2171] But today he's putting a little balance in.
[time=2174] Last week he in the verses we studied emphatically said, no, don't go to a pagan temple and to one of those banquets.
[time=2184] Don't do it.
[time=2186] Now this week he's coming back and saying if meat sold in the marketplace, buy it, don't worry about whether it was sacrificed.
[time=2192] He said, don't even ask the questions.
[time=2195] He's coming to a point of balance of not being in a word over fussy.
[time=2201] You know we as Christians tend to be overly fussy.
[time=2204] We want to break down everything into a list of absolute categories and rules.
[time=2211] Like how long can hair be?
[time=2215] I mean can you have hair that comes over your ears?
[time=2219] You know one of the nice things about my hair is it never grows down over my ears.
[time=2223] It grows out over your ears but never down over mine.
[time=2227] But somebody says, you know I think if you're really committed to Christ, you'll have a haircut.
[time=2232] Just the way I do.
[time=2235] Wow.
[time=2237] Somebody else said, how long can skirt lengths be?
[time=2241] Can they be above the knee?
[time=2243] Can they be above the knee when you sit down?
[time=2246] Can they be above the knee in a high wind?
[time=2249] No, what is the rule? Tell me, I want to know.
[time=2253] There are people who want everything boiled down into rules.
[time=2257] Now don't misunderstand, God has made some absolutes.
[time=2261] You've got to do these if you want to please God.
[time=2264] He's made some negative absolutes.
[time=2266] You don't do these if you want to please him.
[time=2269] But he's created some middle ground.
[time=2271] Now the dangerous thing is that many people want to abdicate their responsibility
[time=2277] to order their own life.
[time=2280] They want somebody else to say, only listen to this music.
[time=2285] Don't ever listen to that music.
[time=2287] You can drink this but you can't drink that.
[time=2289] You can eat this but not too much.
[time=2291] They want somebody else to make all of life's decisions.
[time=2294] They want to abdicate.
[time=2296] And you know the tragedy is, there's always somebody else who's willing to say thank you.
[time=2303] You abdicate and I will authoritative.
[time=2307] I'll say it.
[time=2309] And if you want somebody to tell you how long you can wear your hair, I can give you the name of a church today that would be glad to tell you that.
[time=2317] And they'll make it a test of fellowship.
[time=2321] Now the problem is, you see they all have different names, but ultimately those who will authoritatively declare what must be when God has given liberty, ultimately are headed down a path that is labeled with a name called Jim Jones.
[time=2341] You see that's where it leads.
[time=2343] Whenever you abdicate and you allow somebody else to authoritative, dictate to your life what God has given by way of freedom, you're in trouble.
[time=2353] Because what you're doing is you're replacing the Word of God and the Spirit of God with a human personality.
[time=2360] You've said God, I don't want to listen to your Word.
[time=2363] God, I don't want to listen to your Spirit.
[time=2366] God, I don't want to use the mind and the heart that you've given me.
[time=2370] I'll let hawks do that for me.
[time=2373] Boy, that is foolish.
[time=2376] Not only to let me do it, but to let anyone else.
[time=2379] No matter how noble, no matter how wise, no matter how great they are in some other arena of life, don't you ever abdicate?
[time=2387] What is yours to decide by the principles of God's Word?
[time=2395] You know, there are those principles then that we choose, and we become very sensitive that others choose the way we choose, and you don't have to.
[time=2407] You really don't.
[time=2409] But you must choose based upon the principles of God's Word, and not of the principles of the dictates of our own heart.
[time=2418] But you know, there will always be those who are overly fussy, who want to draw a line.
[time=2426] I don't believe that it's right for me, and I said for me, to drink alcoholic beverages.
[time=2433] Okay, most of you know that.
[time=2435] We're at a friend's house, a friend that I know well enough that when my coke glass was empty said it's in the refrigerator, help yourself.
[time=2442] I got halfway to the refrigerator and panic came across their face.
[time=2446] There was something in the refrigerator stronger than Pepsi Cola.
[time=2451] And suddenly they go, "It's for cooking purposes only!"
[time=2457] I wasn't offended, and it probably was for cooking purposes only.
[time=2462] Well let me ask you this, if you don't believe it's right for you to drink wine, is it all right to eat something that's been cooked in wine?
[time=2468] Well if it's not right for you to drink wine, is it all right for you to go into a store where they sell wine?
[time=2473] Is it all right for you to fly on an airplane where they serve wine?
[time=2476] Try finding one where they don't.
[time=2481] Now, I'm not trying to say that this is right, this is wrong, I'm just saying be careful that you're not overly fussy, that you take a principle and turn it into a burden for yourself and for others.
[time=2494] That's what Paul was afraid, he was afraid these Corinthians were going to say, "Oh Paul said don't ever go into that temple, so don't ever go into that marketplace, don't ever buy that meat, make sure you always ask, because this meat been within 50 feet of an idol." He said, "Just buy this stuff, would you?" And don't even ask.
[time=2513] You can be too particular.
[time=2515] I was helping a friend's father unload some farm products out of the father's truck into the son's garage.
[time=2522] And I said to the father, I said, "Where do you think he wants this stuff?" And the old farmer put back his massive Ferguson hat and he said, "I don't know, but wherever you and I put it, it'll be wrong." Scratched his head and said, "You know, a feller can be just too particular." And you know that's good farm sense.
[time=2542] I think that's kind of the point that Paul's making here in the middle.
[time=2546] You know, take your principles, live by them, but don't be so particular that you're walking around with a guilt and a burden.
[time=2555] That's the introduction. Now verse 23.
[time=2559] He's going to give us several principles here today.
[time=2562] I told the first hour how many there were and made it through the first two, so we're going to do the same today.
[time=2568] Let me give you the first two principles.
[time=2570] And I borrowed some good insights here from our fine friend and teacher John MacArthur.
[time=2576] Verse 23 gives this principle. It is this.
[time=2580] "Edification over gratification." Verse 23 says, "All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient or profitable.
[time=2590] All things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
[time=2596] Let's begin by putting some fences around that phrase, "all things." Now here's a biblical principle of hermeneutics.
[time=2604] And that's a big way of saying interpretation that you need to know.
[time=2607] The word "all" means "all" all the time, except for when "all" doesn't mean "all." Can you remember that? It's true.
[time=2614] The word "all" means "all" all the times, except for when the word "all" doesn't mean "all." Now let me explain to you what that little principle means.
[time=2621] I take the Bible literally.
[time=2623] You know when it says Jesus is coming again on a white horse?
[time=2626] I'm listening for hoofbeats. I take that stuff literally.
[time=2630] But you can take a word beyond literally and make it wooden.
[time=2634] So as by that, we take and we force a meaning on it that it didn't necessarily have.
[time=2641] I love Kathy. She's easy to love.
[time=2644] But I love her. And when I say I love her, I can note that I'm willing to live my life, not only with her, but for her.
[time=2653] I also love milkshakes.
[time=2655] Now don't take it that I therefore live for milkshakes, and I will give my life for a milkshake.
[time=2661] You see what you're doing? You're taking a word and you're forcing it further than the intent of the communicator.
[time=2668] Now, for example, this word "all." Suppose in the middle of the night somebody broke in your house, stuck a gun at you and said, "Give me all that you own."
[time=2678] You say, "Great. Hold on right here. You run downstairs. You get him your mortgage book and say, "It's due the first of every month.
[time=2684] "Here's our trash. Get it out to the curb. It's all yours. I've got this canoe. It's got a big leak in it. It's yours, buddy.
[time=2691] "Here's my mother-in-law. Take it all!" When he said, "Give me all that you have. I don't think he wanted that list."
[time=2701] You have to understand the intent.
[time=2704] Now the word "all" then means "all" all the time, except for when it doesn't mean "all." In the Bible it says that Jesus went around healing all the people.
[time=2714] Does that mean for 33 years nobody on earth was ever sick that Jesus didn't heal?
[time=2719] No, it meant all the people that he healed. He healed them all.
[time=2722] It's a hyperbola. It's a figure of speech.
[time=2727] Now, Paul didn't mean everything was okay. When he said, "All things are lawful to me." He didn't say, "Homosexuality, great. It's lawful now. Immortality, go ahead. It's lawful now.
[time=2738] I've got something you want. Steal it. It's lawful now. No." The context is talking about these issues like eating meat offered to an idol.
[time=2749] These things in the middle. Previously in chapter 6 verse 12 he said the same thing.
[time=2755] "All things are lawful unto me." And that phrase follows him listing off ten sins that if you do these ten,
[time=2765] you will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2768] Now, obviously what you have to understand is there are absolutes that you must do, there are absolutes that you should not do, and there's things in the middle on Paul that's saying, "All this stuff in the middle is lawful to me." He says, "I can eat meat or I can not eat meat. I am free. It is all lawful."
[time=2788] But now here's the principle. He says, "But not everything is expedient."
[time=2794] And not everything edifies.
[time=2799] And the principle then is that we must make our choice not based upon what am I free to do, and therefore I'm free to do it, I will do it.
[time=2808] That's gratification of myself, but edification, edification.
[time=2814] Now that word is a word we don't use as much perhaps as we should.
[time=2818] And edifice is a building. Edification is the process of building.
[time=2823] To edify means that you are building.
[time=2827] And so as principle as this, don't make your choice based upon what is the most immediately gratifying to you, but what is the most edifying to you?
[time=2837] Not what is it that my hormones or my hunger say I want, but what is it that will build me up and be the most expedient, the most profitable, the most productive spiritually that I can possibly follow?
[time=2852] You see, whenever we make a choice, we're making it based upon some premise.
[time=2857] The usual premise in our society, the way we're educated through the news, the schools, through the media, through the music, through the movies, is that we are to make our decision based upon gratification.
[time=2871] What is it that I want? What is it that will make me feel good?
[time=2875] If it feels good, do it. It's your thing.
[time=2879] But Paul here saying even if it is lawful, doesn't necessarily mean I should go ahead,
[time=2886] I have to make the choice first, what will edify versus what will gratify?
[time=2892] What is it that will edify? Well, a number of things can edify, but let me share four things that the Scripture says will edify.
[time=2900] First of all, Acts chapter 20 and verse 32.
[time=2904] The apostle Paul calls the elders of the Church of Ephesus together, and it's a very tender moment in Paul's life.
[time=2911] Paul surmises that he will probably never see these men again.
[time=2915] He wants to impart unto them his heart.
[time=2918] And he also wants to prepare them to face the days ahead without his intervention in leadership.
[time=2924] Verse 32 of Acts 20, he says, "And now brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up." What is it that builds you up?
[time=2939] What is it that edifies you God as He reveals Himself through His Word, His Word of Grace?
[time=2947] Just today, we were here early doing some of the production work for television.
[time=2952] One of the young men who runs cameras said to me as I was going out.
[time=2957] You know, I've been reading the Bible.
[time=2961] I got my life committed to Christ, and I decided I needed to read the Word every day.
[time=2966] He said, "I've got to be at work at seven.
[time=2968] I have to get up before six." He said, "I didn't think I could do that, but I did it for a week." And now it's been a month.
[time=2975] It's great.
[time=2977] And you can see it in his life.
[time=2979] You can see it in his marriage.
[time=2980] You can see it in his life that he's being built up.
[time=2983] Why?
[time=2984] Because he made a choice of something that was going to edify.
[time=2988] You know what I would instinctively do?
[time=2991] I'd say, five-thirty, gratify.
[time=2994] You know, that's instincts.
[time=2997] Sleep.
[time=2998] I'm not saying don't ever sleep.
[time=3000] I'm saying sometimes you make choices that say, "I'll do this because it will edify."
[time=3006] And it may cost you what will gratify.
[time=3009] The Word will edify you.
[time=3011] A second thing that will edify you comes in the same larger context of this study.
[time=3016] 1 Corinthians 8-1 says, "Knowledge puffs up, inflates the ego, but love builds up.
[time=3024] Love edifies." You see, there were those walking around saying, "Hey, I know.
[time=3029] I know that an idol is nothing.
[time=3032] I know these superstitions aren't true.
[time=3035] I know that no demons inhabit raw meat, and if you don't cook it right, the demons get you.
[time=3040] I know they're walking around so proud of what they knew.
[time=3045] And the only thing that they didn't know is that their pride was puffing them up in a way that made them unattractive to God and to people." And he said, "Instead of knowledge which puffs up, love builds up."
[time=3061] One of the greatest ways to be built up is to be a loving person.
[time=3066] It will build you up and will build up the people around you to love them.
[time=3072] A third thing that builds up is serving Christ.
[time=3077] 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 11, let me just read this to you quickly.
[time=3083] "Wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another."
[time=3089] Now, when we serve with our gifts, we are edifying ourselves and particularly others.
[time=3098] Ephesians chapter 4 says, "God gives gifts to men and women." Then he gives the gifted men and women to the church for what?
[time=3107] For the edification of the saints, that's all the body of Christ.
[time=3111] And so when you exercise your spiritual gift, you're edifying the body.
[time=3116] When you take your gift of faith and you stand with your arm around a discouraged brother
[time=3122] whose life has gone shipwrecked and you by your faith in Christ say to him, "Buddy, it's too soon to quit." With God, it is too soon to quit and it's like a transfusion goes from your life to his
[time=3136] because you have the faith to say, "God can rebuild your life." You build up that brother, you edify him or her.
[time=3144] You may have the gift of hospitality.
[time=3148] And you take people and you invite them into your home.
[time=3151] There's a young couple, he's now a deacon in our church.
[time=3154] They've got the gift of hospitality and they build up Sunday school groups by simply receiving people into their heart and into their home.
[time=3162] And they build up people.
[time=3164] You may have the gift of teaching music.
[time=3167] In the last hour, I saw Rich Lee the key.
[time=3169] Rich is a teacher, he teaches music in our school.
[time=3172] And my little six-year-old comes home singing songs.
[time=3175] She not only learned music, but she learned principles.
[time=3177] Well, I tell you, it's great to drive down the street and have your kids singing the back seat.
[time=3181] Obedience is the very best way.
[time=3183] Rich, keep teaching that stuff.
[time=3185] And that's edifying the body.
[time=3187] He not only had a ministry to Rachel, but boy, he did me some good.
[time=3191] He used his gift.
[time=3193] You know, a couple in our church, they're retired.
[time=3196] They probably have a good income, but certainly it's a fixed one now.
[time=3200] When we were heading overseas to visit the missionaries, they came up and gave us an envelope.
[time=3204] And inside it was a note that said, "You never have too much money when you're overseas." And there was some money in there.
[time=3211] And we decided together with them that when we went overseas, we would use their gift of giving
[time=3217] to take missionaries out to dinner.
[time=3220] We hit this one spot, and I'm not going to tell you what country you'll figure out where it was.
[time=3224] I said, "There's a couple that doesn't even know you're back in Fort Wayne, but they would like you to go out to dinner." Some were really nice.
[time=3231] One of the kids in the back room yelled, "Mario's!" And I said, "What's Mario's?" And they said, "Oh, it's the nicest place in town, and it's expensive." Compared to here, it's cheap.
[time=3241] Go there any chance you get.
[time=3243] We said, "Then Mario's is the place." You would have think that they were my kids on Trick or Treat night.
[time=3248] You know, grabbing, they said, "We're really going to go to Mario's." I said, "That's where they want you to go." And they said, "This is great. You know, we've only been over here four years.
[time=3257] We're already eating a good meal." Only four years.
[time=3261] And you know what?
[time=3262] Somebody just said, "God's giving me a gift.
[time=3265] I want to give it." You know what they did?
[time=3267] They took a gift.
[time=3269] And by their gift, they gave it to some people, and it gave them a privilege that you and I have every day of the week.
[time=3276] And they built them.
[time=3277] They were singing praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[time=3283] It's really because somebody used their gift to edify.
[time=3287] You see, serving Christ is one way to edify and to build up.
[time=3293] There's a fourth way the scripture says, and that is fellowship.
[time=3297] I just read 1 Thessalonians 5-11 a moment ago, and it said, "Edify one another." Romans 14 teaches the same thing that we're to build up each other.
[time=3307] What is fellowship?
[time=3308] Someone said it's at least two or more fellows are gals in the same ship.
[time=3312] It's sharing together.
[time=3315] But you know, fellowship can be positive or it can be negative.
[time=3319] You see, if you come into a relationship with a body of people and you come together and you're determined by God's grace, we're going to build up each other.
[time=3326] You can do that.
[time=3328] But Hebrews warned us this, "Beware, lust any root of bitterness,
[time=3334] spring up in you, and by it, many be defiled."
[time=3341] Too many times people have gotten together for what they called fellowship, and it turned out to be an exchange of bitterness.
[time=3349] It was destructive.
[time=3351] And what they were doing is they were drilling holes in their ship, and the water was coming in.
[time=3358] But we can build up each other, how?
[time=3360] Build up each other in love.
[time=3363] By coming together and uniting and saying, "By God's grace, let's have a building process in each other's lives." Well, there's principle number one, edification, overgratification.
[time=3375] Very quickly, principle number two is found in verse 24.
[time=3379] Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.
[time=3383] The second principle is rather simple.
[time=3387] It is this, others over ourselves.
[time=3391] You know that old acrostic, what is joy?
[time=3394] J-O-Y, J-Jesus, O others, Y yourself.
[time=3399] Put it in that order and you have joy in life.
[time=3402] Paul was saying, "It's not only what's going to build me up or what's going to gratify me, but I'm going to make my choices based upon how is what I choose to do going to impact others, both inside the body of Christ and those outside." Next week, we'll talk about are you a stumbling block or a stepping stone?
[time=3421] Do people come towards Christ when they get to you?
[time=3424] They trip, or when they get to you, they step on you, and it helps them get to Christ.
[time=3429] Others.
[time=3431] Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest commandment?" He gave them more than they asked for.
[time=3437] He said, "The greatest is that you love God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your might, and the second is liken unto it, that you love your neighbor as you do yourself." As we make these choices in life, we'll get more to the overfussiness next week, but we make them on principles, don't we?
[time=3458] Not on appetites, not on hungers, not on cravings, not on hormonal instincts, but on principles.
[time=3467] What is it that will edify more than what is it that will gratify?
[time=3474] Secondly, what is it that's going to edify others, not just myself, principles to live by?
[time=3482] But the greatest principle is the principle that Paul gave a few verses earlier when he said, "We've got to belong to Christ." Do you belong to him? I pray that you do.
