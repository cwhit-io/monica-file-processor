[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] >> Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=108] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black-Off Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, a choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=123] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=126] [MUSIC]
[time=154] >> When we pray, we shall know, we shall have a nation, and take me home, but you shall have a Lord.
[time=166] We shall have a God, we'll have a nation, and we'll play in the God, I'll bring the Lord.
[time=178] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=214] >> Thank you, you may be seated. Jesus said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[time=228] I'm sure each of us have come with a diversity of experiences from the prior week.
[time=234] Some of you have sailed in today on the wings of the eagle, victory has been yours. Others of you have trudged through another week and you survived it.
[time=245] Regardless of our circumstances and our situation, Jesus invites us to come unto him and to find rest from our labor.
[time=255] This hour as we worship, we trust it will be a time when you give to the Lord your worship and you get from him a sense of rest to your soul.
[time=264] There's an old spiritual that says, "Lay your burdens down, lay your burdens down."
[time=270] I hope that right now you'll be able spiritually to lay your burdens down and to worship with us.
[time=275] Thank you for joining us today. Both those of us who are here in this auditorium and our friends who allow us to minister to them by way of television,
[time=283] we trust that today in Jesus Christ you'll find a fulfillment in life.
[time=288] [MUSIC]
[time=303] To the Lord of your song, let his praises fill the temple.
[time=312] He is the king of kings, and the Lord of lords, bow down before him.
[time=322] Sing unto the Lord of your song, let his praises fill the temple.
[time=332] He is the king of kings, and the Lord of lords, bow down before him.
[time=342] Hallelujah, glory to God, hallelujah, glory to God.
[time=362] Sing unto the Lord of your song, for he loves to hear our praises.
[time=372] Hallelujah, glory to God, hallelujah, glory to God.
[time=428] Sing unto the Lord of your song, let his praises fill the temple.
[time=438] He is the king of kings, and the Lord of lords, bow down before him.
[time=448] Hallelujah, glory to God, hallelujah, glory to God, hallelujah, glory to God.
[time=477] Hallelujah, glory to God.
[time=519] He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise to God. Joyful, joyful, we adore the hymn number 8.
[time=526] Let us sing together. Please, the first, third, and fourth stanzas of this great hymn, hymn number 8.
[time=540] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of all.
[time=550] Arts and all life, art before thee, go me through the sun above.
[time=559] Love, love, love, love, sin and sadness, prime the dark of glory.
[time=568] Giver of inward awareness, fill us with the light of day.
[time=579] Oh, art giving and for giving, everlasting, everlasting, everlasting, of our joy of living.
[time=592] Ocean, death, love, happy breast.
[time=597] Love, art, love, and Christ our brother, of living, of our own.
[time=606] Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.
[time=617] Lord, old, roll the happy chorus, which the morning stars began.
[time=626] Father, love is training for us, brother, love, mind, friend, and friend.
[time=635] Ever seeing the arts beyond work, it burns in our midst of fear.
[time=644] Joyful, musically, the sun would give our triumph from our life.
[time=657] Worshiping the Lord suggests action, and we appreciate the fact that you get actively involved in our congregational singing.
[time=664] Thank you for that it's a blessing to all of our hearts.
[time=668] The handbell choir led by Rich Liddikey works faithfully every week in preparation for a morning such as this.
[time=676] Let's listen to their music now as they minister to us.
[time=694] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=935] [APPLAUSE]
[time=938] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=949] For us, it's early Sunday morning.
[time=951] For those of you who are watching in Fort Wayne, it's late Sunday morning, and for others, it's even evening time.
[time=957] We come in early to record just a few moments before the morning worship service so that we can share with you special events coming up that should be of interest to you.
[time=967] Pete, how are you this morning?
[time=968] I'm just fine, Rick.
[time=970] In the last few weeks, you've been introducing us to your recent trip to the Orient in other countries,
[time=976] and I understand tonight we're going to get a full-fledged presentation of your trip, and we're looking forward to that.
[time=981] Well, tonight's the night.
[time=983] For the last few weeks, we've been sharing just brief excerpts of experiences that we had in Japan, Hong Kong, and particularly the Philippines.
[time=991] And so tonight in our evening service, we've gotten our slides back, and Kathy and I are going to share from our heart and from our head
[time=998] things we've learned, and more importantly than that, some ideas as to how the people of this community can strengthen the Lord's work overseas.
[time=1006] Well, I think if people want to get excited about missions, this would be an evening to come and join with us because there's nothing like the hands-on experience of being there, seeing our missionaries in action.
[time=1016] So we invite all of you that are watching today. If you have the opportunity to come join us tonight at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m.
[time=1024] for the presentation of the missions trip from our pastor, Rick, and his wife, Kathy.
[time=1029] Well, thanks for that good commercial. Now let me do one for you.
[time=1032] Two weeks from tonight in our Sunday evening service on May the 18th, our choir will be premiering a brand new album that has some very excellent music that is so worshipful.
[time=1043] Some of the songs are powerful and make you feel like if the Lord doesn't come before this song ends, then something's wrong.
[time=1050] Others of it are a little bit more quieter and worshipful and give you a time for introspection.
[time=1056] I'm looking forward to that. The album sounds great.
[time=1059] Well, thank you, Rick. We've been working on this for many months.
[time=1062] It takes a long time to prepare the music and then record it and have the record pressed and the jacket made,
[time=1068] but that record will be coming Lord willing this week, and we'll have it available.
[time=1073] I often struggle with the fact of having a very good reproduction of the product as well as the ministry,
[time=1080] and I think we can be confident that God has blessed us with some great music and some good musicians who have really given their talents to the Lord, and this will be a record that will minister to the hearts of people.
[time=1091] Now, having heard it, I agree totally. We do want to invite you to join us at six o'clock on Sunday night,
[time=1097] May the 18th, to hear an evening of praise and celebration.
[time=1102] This is the month of May, and May obviously has a number of holidays in particular Mother's Day.
[time=1108] And because of that, we want to share with you an excellent little booklet entitled "Motherhood."
[time=1114] It helps if you smile.
[time=1116] Being a mother is probably one of the more demanding yet less thankful jobs.
[time=1121] Most of the time, children don't get up in the morning and thank their moms for what happened throughout the night and the day before.
[time=1128] We need to take a day, like next Sunday Mother's Day, to say a special word of thanks for mothers for their labor of love over the years.
[time=1137] Pete, you and I have the privilege that both of our mothers are still living, and I'll remind you to call your mom if you'll remind me.
[time=1144] Thank you, Rick. We really need to do that.
[time=1146] We also want to encourage you to write for this booklet.
[time=1149] You can just use the word "Motherhood" when you're referring to that booklet.
[time=1153] Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1161] Just ask for the booklet entitled "Motherhood." Write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1168] Zip is 46815.
[time=1171] Pete, this is not a booklet on how to be the super mom.
[time=1174] You know that days are so common with the how-to books and how to get your laundry cleaner and how to make your kids grow taller and how to make your vegetables last longer, and I don't know where the list stops.
[time=1185] This is really a booklet of encouragement and illustrations.
[time=1188] It comes from Jim Dobson, who is probably the best communicator about the family.
[time=1194] And one of the things that makes Dr. Dobson so winsome is his capability with humor.
[time=1199] And this is a humorous book with stories and illustrations from mothers who've written into him some of their experiences.
[time=1206] I know that you'll be able to sit down and laugh and feel good about your role as a mother.
[time=1212] If you're not a mother, still write for the book.
[time=1214] You'll enjoy it.
[time=1215] Perhaps you can give it to someone who will need that type of encouragement.
[time=1219] Thank you again for joining us today.
[time=1221] I want to encourage you to open your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 so we can study again principles on balancing our life.
[time=1228] Let's be committed to principles, but yet again, let's not be overly fussy.
[time=1233] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1253] [MUSIC - 195 seconds]
[time=1455] Thank you, Kevin. The Old Testament says that God inhabits us the praise of his people.
[time=1462] So today, as we come and worship him, he comes and he worships with us with the promise that we're two or three or gathered together in his name, he would be there.
[time=1472] Our God and our Father, we today thank you for your word, the promises of your presence, not only here, but in our life.
[time=1480] And so we, in keeping with the Scriptures, ask you to be present today, Lord Jesus, as we meet in your name.
[time=1487] And I, for one, would like to abdicate the position of teacher and ask you by your spirit to teach us and to guide us in truth.
[time=1496] God, I sense my own humanity and my susceptibility to prejudice thought with my own and not to see what you want to say.
[time=1505] So today, God, we surrender to you to teach us, and we ask your assistance.
[time=1511] We pray that you'll give us teachable hearts, that as your word speaks, we would so order our lives.
[time=1518] Help us to reevaluate and direct our lives according to your word, and not to reevaluate and direct your word according to our lives.
[time=1528] God is men and women today, there is a pressure that comes on every side, and we struggle to keep life in balance.
[time=1539] So God, through your word today, we would even ask that you would teach us that rare capability of balance,
[time=1546] so as not to be shifted to go with the flow of those who see everything as being safe if it's just conservative,
[time=1554] or to get out of balance on the other extreme and to say, if it's easy, if it's fun, if it's attractive, if it's pleasing, it's got to be right.
[time=1563] God, you've said your word is a lamp and a light, and we today ask you to shed light in our lives.
[time=1570] We pray today that your word would give strength to those who are struggling.
[time=1574] We pray today for Paul Feichter, with his eyes that you would give his doctors wisdom in treating those delicate parts of the body.
[time=1582] We pray for those who are recovering from surgery, Bob Geller, Bill Kaufman.
[time=1590] We pray today with joy for the Robinsons and the riches in others who've had the joy of children enter their home and their lives.
[time=1599] We thank you for the safety of mother and child.
[time=1602] We today, God, want to pray for those who battle on the long road with cancer.
[time=1608] Those who live with cancer, but with you, they live with hope.
[time=1613] We just pray that you would strengthen the lives of those cancer patients like Catherine and Stevie Ewing and others.
[time=1621] Father, through your word today, we would pray that you would teach us.
[time=1625] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1629] Last week, we began a message in confession time.
[time=1633] We're going to finish the same one this week because we didn't get it finished last week.
[time=1638] The theme was being on overly fussy, having some rules that end up instead of guiding us and imprisoning us.
[time=1646] There was a man by the name of Tom Garrett who lived in Los Angeles, California.
[time=1651] Unfortunately, he was an unemployed electrical worker, collecting compensation temporarily from the state of California.
[time=1659] Two inmates from San Luis Obispo, about an hour's drive north, escaped from the San Luis Obispo County Jail,
[time=1667] took refuge in Tom Garrett's house, holding him hostage in his own home for about 24 hours before the police could secure his release.
[time=1676] The next Friday, Tom Garrett went to the state unemployment office to seek to have his weekly check of compensation.
[time=1684] The person that he talked to reviewed that week with him found out that he was indeed held hostage on Monday.
[time=1691] Now, the state laws in California say for you to collect unemployment, you have to be available to work every working day of that week.
[time=1700] And since he was unavailable on Monday, being detained at gunpoint, they wouldn't give him his unemployment compensation.
[time=1708] Well, a matter went from one person to another to a committee who agreed that the law said you've got to be available to work
[time=1715] and being held hostage at gunpoint was no excuse.
[time=1719] The law stood.
[time=1720] Well, fortunately, a gracious governor heard the case and wrote out a personal check to help this unemployed man.
[time=1727] Isn't that amazing that a law can be so rigid that it misses the whole point?
[time=1732] There was a pastor about 100 years ago who was trying by horse and buggy to make it down the only road that would take him from his home to his church.
[time=1742] The road was blocked and he could not get through it around it, and he headed back for home in a panic. How could he possibly get the church?
[time=1751] Well, he was a relatively good skater, and he decided the only way that he could make it was the skate on the river that went from his house past the church,
[time=1760] so he laced up a skate and off he dashed, making it in church just in time to deliver a relatively good message,
[time=1767] after which the board of elders asked them to meet with him, and they were expressing to him their great disappointment that he was out skating on the Lord's Day, the Sabbath,
[time=1780] and no small fury arose in this brief called meeting about his skating on the Lord's Day.
[time=1787] One man was finally able to solve the whole dilemma, and he said, "Pastor, did you enjoy that skate?" The pastor said, "No, I was hurrying." He said, "Then it's probably all right. Meeting's closed."
[time=1798] Isn't it amazing the rules that we can come up with that often are meant for good, but end up binding us?
[time=1805] One of my favorite theologians was Andy of Mayberry. Remember him?
[time=1810] Andy of Mayberry once said, "How come it is that I always got the seat of my own britches caught on my own pitchfork?"
[time=1819] Have you ever done that? Gotting yourself caught up in your own structures?
[time=1823] Paul is writing to the Corinthians, and he's given some absolutes.
[time=1828] He's talked about that in life God says, "Thou shall maintain thy body for sexual purity."
[time=1835] He drew an absolute. He said, "God has maintained a value that thou shall tell the truth, and you don't lie."
[time=1841] He drew an absolute. But then Paul confesses that God hasn't passed a commandment on everything.
[time=1848] And aren't you glad that God gives us choices? If he didn't give us choices, we wouldn't be people.
[time=1855] We would be computers. And he gives us some middle ground for you to be you and for me to be me.
[time=1862] That doesn't speak for those areas that he has strictly prohibited or prescribed.
[time=1867] Now, in this middle ground comes that old argument of eating meat off her dietels.
[time=1873] And in chapter 10, he gives some balancing comments. Last week in chapter 10, we looked at verses 23 and 24.
[time=1882] Even prior to that, Paul said, "Don't go to a pagan temple. Don't ever do that.
[time=1888] Sit down at that table and eat meat that's offered to sacrifice right in front of you to a pagan god. Don't go."
[time=1895] But now he's coming back with some balance, and he's going to be saying there's some things you can do.
[time=1900] I found in here five principles, we gave you two of them last week. I would ask you if you remember.
[time=1906] But if I asked you and you didn't, I would be embarrassed. So let me just remind you.
[time=1911] First of all, in verse 23, he teaches the principle of edification over gratification.
[time=1918] Gratification says, "Boy, I'd like to do something." Edification says, "But, well, build up my faith in Christ."
[time=1925] Second principle was found in verse 24, which was the principle that timeless one, others, over myself.
[time=1933] Not only what is it I would like to do, but how's that going to influence the body of Christ, the others?
[time=1939] In the next verses, he gives us three more principles that I'd like to share with you.
[time=1944] Let me read for you first, though. Chapter 10, verses 25 through chapter 11, verse 1.
[time=1951] "Whatever is sold in the marketplace, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
[time=1961] For the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof. If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast
[time=1969] and ye be disposed to go, whatever is set before you eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
[time=1977] But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice and the idols eat not.
[time=1985] For his sake that showed it. And for conscience sake, for the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=1993] Conscience, I say, not thine own but of the other.
[time=1998] For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience?
[time=2002] For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?
[time=2011] Whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=2018] Give no offense, neither to the Jews nor to the Greeks nor to the Church of God.
[time=2026] Even as I please all men and all things, not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of many, that they might be saved.
[time=2035] Be therefore followers of me, even as I also am a follower of Christ.
[time=2043] I introduce to you a third principle, edification over gratification, others over self and now this principle.
[time=2052] The principle of liberty over legalism.
[time=2056] Liberty over legalism. In total Paul is going to give us four situations.
[time=2061] Situation one was eating at a pagan feast in a pagan temple that's being dedicated to a pagan god and he says, don't go.
[time=2070] But now in verse 25 he gives us a second situation. He says, whatever is sold in the market, that eat.
[time=2078] Now he says, what if you go into the marketplace and you want to buy some meat and you knowingly or unknowingly, either way, buy some meat that indeed had been sacrificed to idols.
[time=2090] Now you didn't go into the temple, you didn't sit down at the bank, you didn't bow your head or whatever they do when they pray to the pagan gods.
[time=2097] But you simply went down to the local meat market and you bought meat that was offered to idols.
[time=2104] What should you do? Here comes the balance. He said, whatever is sold in the marketplace, that eat.
[time=2115] It reminds me of a great principle that comes from Hezekiah 2. Would you turn to Hezekiah please?
[time=2121] Some of you are looking, others are snickering. There's no Hezekiah in the Bible.
[time=2125] Well, there's a king Hezekiah, there's no book. Hezekiah 2.2 is one of those rare verses that I made up. It says, sweat down not the small stuff.
[time=2135] I really think that's a free translation of what Paul's trying to say here. There are some big issues in life.
[time=2141] And we better be men and women of constitution and substance and we say, no.
[time=2147] Or when appropriate, yes. But sometimes we get in the habit of saying, no, and yes, so emphatically, we become yes and no people on every issue of life.
[time=2160] You know, it's refreshing to meet people who don't have an opinion on everything.
[time=2165] Paul's saying, here's a major issue. Homosexuality, chapter 6, hits it head on.
[time=2172] Here's a major issue, embezzlement, chapter 6, he hits it head on.
[time=2177] Here's a major issue, eating in a pagan temple, hit it head on. This is small stuff.
[time=2182] Now, he says, you're going in the marketplace and some of you are so religiously opinionated, you're standing there wondering, has this meat been offered to an idol?
[time=2191] So, if it has, he's saying, when you go in the market, just take whatever it is, buy it and eat it and relax, sweat down not the small stuff.
[time=2202] As a matter of fact, he goes on to give even a greater sense of freedom. He says, don't even ask any questions.
[time=2210] You don't have to say to the butcher. Now, has this been offered to an idol? How about this over here? I saw this was on sale.
[time=2217] Did you grind that up so we wouldn't recognize it as leftovers from, don't ask? Don't ask. That's liberty.
[time=2227] Liberty says, I don't have to walk around with a great deal of fear, that I can just know what God's word says, and in this middle ground, I can relax.
[time=2238] I don't have to be uptight thinking that I may inadvertently offend God. God says, relax. Go to the marketplace.
[time=2249] If it's on sale and you want to buy it, buy it. If you don't want to buy it, don't buy it, but sweat down not the small stuff.
[time=2257] One of the dangers of modern day evangelical Christianity is that in order to fill all the time on Christian radio and Christian television, we make issues out of things that I'm not even sure God knows we're an issue.
[time=2272] I love Christian broadcasting, and I'll smile under the camera as I say that. There isn't anything wrong with Christian broadcasting.
[time=2280] But sometimes we get on a roll and we find out the audience really responds if we talk about the issues of life.
[time=2289] Then we discover that we're running out of issues before we're running out of airtime, and some of the talk shows can generate issues that really ought to be left alone.
[time=2300] I'm waiting for the day when someone comes up and says, I'd just like to have an half hour of airtime to plead the cause of the red maple leaves.
[time=2310] Do you know that in America the red maple leaves are going extinct? And did you know that in the Word, it's in the book.
[time=2318] It says that God told Adam and Eve to tell the garden and how irresponsible of us not to defend the red maple leaves.
[time=2325] Well, I'll tell you, and across this nation today, there's probably not one other pastor other than myself standing up for the red maple leaves.
[time=2332] When was the last time you heard us, sir? And they can go on for days on nothing, making issues.
[time=2339] The Corinthians were famous for that. They wanted an issue out of everything, and he's saying, sweat it not. Relax.
[time=2348] Now, we're not teaching situational ethics. We're not saying where God has said yes, and when God has said no, that these principles apply.
[time=2356] We're talking about this middle ground, and he's saying liberty over legalism.
[time=2363] He gives us a third illustration now. We've been in the temple. Now we're in the marketplace. Let's take a third one.
[time=2369] What if you work with a guy who's not a believer? And he says, hey, my wife and I are having a number of couples over Saturday night.
[time=2380] How about coming over? What do you do? This guy's not a believer. No doubt about it.
[time=2387] Well, you take out your evangelical checklist, and you say, all right, will you be playing rock music before we eat?
[time=2394] Will you be serving alcoholic beverages? Will you be cooking with alcohol? Will you be serving anything that was bought at a store that's on our Christian boycott list?
[time=2404] Now, I'm not saying that any of those choices of yours are a problem. I hold to some of those convictions.
[time=2410] I think it's great that Christians didn't shop at a 7-Eleven, and they got them to drop pornography.
[time=2416] But do we all of a sudden say, I won't go to your house if you buy some of those stores? Let's see what he says.
[time=2422] Verse 27, "If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast," they say, come on over. We're going to grill out the stakes.
[time=2432] We're going to have a great time. Come on over. And they say, come on. What do you do? It says, if you be disposed to go.
[time=2439] No, I like that. It doesn't say you have to go every place you've been invited for dinner.
[time=2443] But if you be disposed to go, it says, whatever is set before you eat it. Don't quiz the guy down.
[time=2453] Just eat it. They serve prime rib. Who cares whether it was sacrificed the night before in a pagan temple?
[time=2462] Simply take it and eat it. Don't worry about it.
[time=2466] Again, sweat thou not the small stuff. And he says, don't ask any questions.
[time=2473] How insensitive we can become trying to maintain our religiosity thinking that someone's really going to be impressed that we're committed to the Lord.
[time=2483] As we lay before them, all of our sanctimonious do's and don'ts. And we think somehow they're going to say, wow, they've got convictions.
[time=2492] They'll probably go, wow, and not invite you back.
[time=2497] Ray Stedman wrote a good paragraph on this. Let me read it to you.
[time=2503] It is clear that separation to Christ does not mean isolation from non-Christians.
[time=2510] Our fellowship is to be with Christ. Our friendship is to be given to the non-Christians around us.
[time=2518] That is important. Christians who refuse to do that are only deceiving themselves.
[time=2524] They are disobeying the Lord's command to go forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.
[time=2530] We are to go and to enjoy ourselves, asking no questions.
[time=2536] Paul says, if someone asks you to go, then go.
[time=2540] Now, no one is going to ask you to dinner if you are an uptight, self-righteous, legalistic Christian.
[time=2550] Don't worry. You won't get the invitation in the first place.
[time=2557] Someone invites you to go somewhere. You'd kind of like to go.
[time=2561] But what if it's going to be something that's, you know, you just wouldn't do that in your home?
[time=2567] If you want to go, go. If you're wondering what's been served, don't ask any questions.
[time=2576] Relax. We don't have to carry our commandments in our pockets so that we can always draw them out and to check.
[time=2587] Relax. Liberty over legalism. Don't ever lose that.
[time=2596] You see, for every time we think we're impressing the world by our deep religious conviction,
[time=2602] there's probably someone there that we're impressing.
[time=2605] But there's probably at least one other someone that we're alienating.
[time=2609] You're saying, I don't understand that. Liberty over legalism. Go. Don't even ask any questions.
[time=2618] Well, there's three circumstances. The temple, the marketplace, the home, and now a fourth circumstance.
[time=2624] What if you're there and you're feeling free in Christ or conscience isn't condemning you?
[time=2629] You're at this guy's house or you're at the marketplace and somebody stands next to you in the marketplace
[time=2636] just as you're about to make this prime selection at a good price.
[time=2639] And they say, well, hello, how are you? Oh, you're going to buy that?
[time=2643] That's the stuff that's offered to the idols last night.
[time=2647] Now, what do you do? You're free, but your brother's making a point out of the deal.
[time=2653] Well, verse 28. But if any man send you, this is offered in sacrifice and the idols eat not for his sake.
[time=2664] He's making the point now that your convictions may be free and open, but somebody else around you may not share those exact same convictions.
[time=2675] And for the sake of that other person, then you don't eat. That's tough, isn't it?
[time=2682] That can be so frustrating to have your liberty squelched by somebody else who quite frankly and bluntly is immature spiritually.
[time=2694] They're the weaker brother. They're the weaker sister.
[time=2698] And now it says if they make an issue out of it, even though you're wise enough not to, if somebody else makes an issue, then you decline.
[time=2707] Two questions show the spirit of most of us when somebody else is stepping on our rights.
[time=2715] Verse 29 says, conscience, I say, not thine own but the other.
[time=2720] Now, here's the question, for why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience?
[time=2727] I mean, let's just make up an illustration here.
[time=2730] If I feel free to watch a certain television show and you don't feel free to watch it, why is it that I am judged now because of your conscience?
[time=2746] Why that burns me.
[time=2749] Next verse gives another question, for if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that which I give thanks?
[time=2758] Now he's going back to the principle that he's stated twice. It comes from the Psalms that the earth is the Lord and everything in it, the fullness thereof.
[time=2768] He's saying, why if I buy meat, so what if it's offered to idols, my conscience is clean and I recognize that everything comes from the Lord and I give thanks, why am I evil spoken of?
[time=2781] It's kind of that old dilemma that how is it that I am accountable not only for me but for you?
[time=2787] Do you remember Cain and his animosity towards his brother Abel?
[time=2792] The Lord confronts Cain and says, where's your brother Abel? And Cain says, am I my brother's keeper?
[time=2800] Not somewhat of the same spirit. Well, I have to do what Ed does. Can I do it if Brian doesn't do it?
[time=2810] Obviously that violates the previous principle that says others over self. But he uses that as a beautiful lead-in to a fourth principle.
[time=2820] That principle is this. It is the glory of God over the pleasing of self.
[time=2827] Verse 30 raises the question. Verse 31 gives the answer, whether therefore you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
[time=2843] He's saying, because in your willingness to exercise your liberty, and then having that freedom decide not to exercise that liberty, for another brother or sister's sake, God is glorified in that.
[time=2858] Let's get philosophical for a moment. There are three basic philosophical questions that are timeless. They are, who am I?
[time=2867] Why am I here? Not at Black Hawk, but on planet Earth. You may be asking that too, but philosophically we're asking why you're here on planet Earth.
[time=2877] And finally, where am I going? Well, if you take the naturalist view, you say that we are the product of time plus space plus chance.
[time=2885] And this got together with that, and there was a collision, and that collision spun off an organic material, and that organic material just became life one day.
[time=2894] And that you are the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchild of a fruit fly.
[time=2902] And that's who you are. Secondly, why you're here? Your mission as an overdeveloped fruit fly is to escape the proverbial fly's water as long as possible. Death.
[time=2913] That's why you're here. And finally, where are you going? You're going back to that dust that the original flute fly came out of.
[time=2923] Now, I mean, that's being a little coarse, but that's really what the naturalist teaches.
[time=2929] Now, biblically, what does God say? Well, God says, "Who are you? You are a person that he has chosen to create uniquely, and not only to create you, but he has fashioned you and me in a way that we are like him.
[time=2944] We are made in his image and his likeness." That phrase, image and likeness at least means that we have the ability to know, to relate, and to fellowship with God.
[time=2956] He's made us like himself in enough ways that we can know him and relate in fellowship to him. That's who we are.
[time=2964] Why are we here? Well, Revelation 4.11 says, "God has created all things for his own pleasure and glory."
[time=2974] A group of theologians, hundreds of years ago, got together to draw up a document called the Shorter Catechism, the Westminster Catechism.
[time=2982] And in it, it says, "What is the chief duty of man but to glorify God and to enjoy him forever?"
[time=2990] Do you know that if you make your purpose in life, simply to escape that fly-swatter death and to a mask is much wealth and pleasure in between, you will die a miserable soul?
[time=3002] But if you make your purpose in life to glorify God, you'll find fulfillment within that can never be matched, because that's what he's made you for.
[time=3012] God has made you for himself and he's made you that your greatest fulfillment life will come when you glorify him.
[time=3022] And you know, you don't have to have a voice like our choir to glorify God.
[time=3027] Certainly music glorifies him, but this passage is saying, "When you are when I willingly give up my exercise of liberty to strengthen somebody else's walk in Christ, that glorifies God."
[time=3041] That makes God's face radiate a little brighter.
[time=3045] That makes his mouth form the lips.
[time=3048] Well done now, good and faithful servant.
[time=3050] That's what I like.
[time=3052] It glorifies him, and that's what he has made us for.
[time=3057] You know, it says, "Even the most simple things in life bring glory to God." The way we eat, the way we drink, the way we conduct our everyday events of life.
[time=3069] There's not anything more basic than eating and drinking is there.
[time=3073] And he says, "Even the simplest of tasks can be done to the glory of God." It's mostly a matter of attitude, isn't it?
[time=3080] The earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=3083] That's when I recognize that it belongs to God, and what I give him thanks when I have a clean conscience about what I do, that's glorifying God.
[time=3091] And then suddenly you come on the scene and you'd like me to do it different, and I'd really not like you, but I'd do it different anyway.
[time=3098] That glorifies God a little more.
[time=3101] And you see, the ethic that's pounded into our head day after day after day is it's your life.
[time=3106] Do what you want to.
[time=3107] It's your life.
[time=3108] Do what you please.
[time=3109] Don't let anybody else tell you what to do.
[time=3112] God says that's death.
[time=3114] But life is when you glorify me.
[time=3117] And isn't it exciting to think that the simplest things that we can do command the attention of the God of the universe and cause him to say, "Well done."
[time=3126] That's why I've made you.
[time=3128] That's what you're here for.
[time=3131] Do glorify me.
[time=3134] A fifth principle.
[time=3138] I've talked about glorifying God over pleasing self, this one is being a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block.
[time=3147] Verse 31 says, "Whether therefore you eat or drink, whatever you do, do it to the glory of God, give no offense."
[time=3157] That's not the word stumbling block, but it is the same concept.
[time=3161] Something that offends is something that repels, keeps away.
[time=3166] Something that offends is that which causes you to stop and to step back and to remove yourself.
[time=3174] The whole world is searching, either consciously or unconsciously, for God.
[time=3181] And when they come to you and when they come to me, they will find us to be one of two things.
[time=3188] They will either find us to be a stumbling block, something that is offensive, something that repels them from God and turns them away.
[time=3201] Or they'll find us to be a stepping stone.
[time=3205] One of those points that when the river gets too wide to cross, there's a rock you can step on in the middle that helps you get to the other side.
[time=3216] There is a wide stream that separates all of humanity from God.
[time=3222] But God has strategically placed Christians right in the middle of that stream as stepping stones.
[time=3229] And one of the best ways to be a stepping stone is to live for God's glory.
[time=3234] People step on you. That doesn't always feel good, does it?
[time=3239] You've been stepped on before.
[time=3242] But what a joy it is to be a stepping stone for someone to come to God.
[time=3248] Here he says, "Don't give any offense to any of the three groups, Jews, Gentiles or even believers."
[time=3256] But why is that? Verse 33. Paul says even as I myself, I think he's going right back to chapter 9 verses 19 through 23.
[time=3265] I please all men and all things, not seeking my own prophet, but the prophet of many. Why?
[time=3271] So that they might be saved. Be a stepping stone.
[time=3276] Sometimes we err because we think we've got to make the Christian life look super attractive.
[time=3281] So we've got to be hip. We've got to be with it. We've got to be the 80s, you know.
[time=3286] And a lot of times the world looks at and says, "Man, you don't have anything gone on that isn't gone on anywhere else."
[time=3292] And we err. Other times we say, "We're going to take the safe, the conservative route, the route of our fathers."
[time=3301] And so we always have these rigid convictions.
[time=3304] And the world says, "Boy, if that's what it means to come to Christ, no."
[time=3310] There's got to be that rare balance, doesn't there, of moving.
[time=3313] And I don't think Paul was a chameleon. I don't think he was brown when he was round.
[time=3317] People were brown and green when he was around. People were green just because he always wanted everybody to like him.
[time=3324] He lived by absolutes. But you know, in that middle ground, Paul adjusted himself.
[time=3328] He was probably the original when in Rome do like the Romans.
[time=3333] Because when he was out with the people who could eat meat, he ate it.
[time=3337] When he was with those who couldn't, he didn't. He told Timothy, hmm, circumcision.
[time=3343] That's a problem. He told Titus just the opposite advice.
[time=3346] When he was with the Gentiles, he did the Gentile things. He went back to Jerusalem and he took a Hebrew vow, shaved his head.
[time=3354] Why? He was just moving with freedom in that middle ground.
[time=3358] Why? Because when he was with the Gentiles, he wanted to get to as close to them as he could and still maintain character because they needed a stepping stone.
[time=3367] And when he was with the Jews, he got as close to them as he could because they likewise needed a stepping stone.
[time=3374] You know, one of the privileges that his mind is to see you and to see how many of you God has used as a stepping stone.
[time=3381] I see a friend here today, his boss at a complex and his boss's wife came to Christ because he was there as a stepping stone.
[time=3389] Joe came to the Lord on Easter Sunday morning because some of the men of our church became stepping stones.
[time=3395] Be a stepping stone. Not a stumbling block.
[time=3400] Then Paul makes not another principle, just a final appeal. He said, "Be ye followers of me, even as I am a follower of Christ."
[time=3407] Psychologically, we call that term "modeling." He's saying, "I'm following Christ and you can follow me in this matter."
[time=3415] We've got a responsibility to be a good model and to select good role models.
[time=3421] Much of what's being said today is a concern by way of what comes through the airways of television and radio.
[time=3429] In America, we don't have royalty. Someone wisely said at dinner last night, "But in America, the rock musician and the athlete and the silver screen artist, they are our royalty."
[time=3441] And the danger is they become the role models for our generation, and they're not always good ones.
[time=3447] The Bible says that we're to be and to follow appropriate role models.
[time=3452] If you ever had a child, then you'll know as they grew up what it means to be a role model.
[time=3460] Little boys like to be just like their dads, don't they?
[time=3463] Little girls love to be just like their moms, and they do things just the way we do.
[time=3470] You know, some of these may be looking at Christ, and they're going to say what Christ is like by the way we do it.
[time=3476] Some may be made new in Christ, and they'll do it just the way we do it.
[time=3481] People are looking at you. Do they see Jesus?
[time=3503] You've been listening to the message today from our pastor Rick Hawks from First Corinthians, and the music from our Bible Our Musicians.
[time=3511] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your walk with God, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you.
[time=3518] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3521] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3528] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3535] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3541] We are always encouraged when you write us, and when you write, tell us the nature of your decision, and we'll send you a booklet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
