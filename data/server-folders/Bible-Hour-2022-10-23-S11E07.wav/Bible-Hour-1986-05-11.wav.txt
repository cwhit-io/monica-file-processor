[time=31] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=35] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special grooves and soloists, and the message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=50] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=54] [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=150] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=154] It is a joy to welcome you on this Sunday morning as we as a nation commemorate
[time=161] and rejoice in thankfulness for our mothers.
[time=165] Mother's Day, part of an American tradition.
[time=168] It was probably started by one of those greeting card companies, but it's a good tradition anyway.
[time=173] And today we've had an overflow crowd in both services, which means we have a lot of mothers from out of town visiting, and a lot of mothers who live in town conning their sons and daughters to finally come to church one Sunday.
[time=186] I don't know why you came today, but I want you to know we're glad that you're here.
[time=191] And we hope that this is a day not only that you can rejoice and give thanks for your mother, but you can rejoice in giving thanks to God for the gift of life and the gift of eternal life in his Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=204] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=206] Both you are friends here and our friends who join us for the Bible are.
[time=210] We sincerely hope that God uses his word to strengthen our faith in him and in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=217] Today our stage is very different.
[time=219] We're preparing for tonight.
[time=221] We have a children's musical.
[time=223] The musical is going to be from grades one through six.
[time=226] It's going to be an exciting time.
[time=228] They have more energy than I ever dreamed about having.
[time=231] They channeled that energy into a great presentation of music about God's love.
[time=236] The musical was titled Agapa Opolis.
[time=240] Now you may have to practice saying it took me a week to say it, but I worked on it and I hope you can come and join us tonight.
[time=246] And this morning a different group of our young people are going to be presenting some very special tributes to mothers.
[time=252] Thank you for joining us.
[time=254] Pete's going to lead us now so you want to take out your hymn books and we'll rejoice in singing again.
[time=260] Let us continue praising the Savior singing hymn number 41.
[time=263] Now thank we all our God.
[time=265] We'll sing all three verses together.
[time=290] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=412] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=414] The sanctuary choir has been given a day of rest so that they can join their family and celebrating Mother's Day today.
[time=422] I'd like to encourage you however to set aside next Sunday evening May 18th at 6 p.m.
[time=428] The choir will be presenting the premier performance of their new record.
[time=432] They've been working since September on this and it's a delightful piece of work that they've done in the last months.
[time=439] We appreciate their skill in making the record as well as the ministry that it'll have.
[time=443] Please join us next Sunday evening May 18th for that 6 p.m. performance.
[time=448] Mothers, we presented something special for you.
[time=451] It's entitled to mother with love and the music gallery begins our musical tribute to you.
[time=457] [MUSIC]
[time=465] When God made this great universe he had a wondrous plan
[time=471] He took some dust and gave it life and thus created land
[time=477] And from this man he took the ribbon, made a helper grant
[time=483] And she in turn became the foremost mother of the land
[time=489] And she became the first, the foremost mother of the land
[time=502] [MUSIC]
[time=509] To let man good not do all the things that must be done He needed mothers to complete the work he had begun
[time=520] We loved our dads and what they do was not being minimized
[time=526] But to all mothers listening now our love is verbalized
[time=533] To mother with love, to mother with love
[time=539] We sing this song to mother with love
[time=546] To mother with love, to mother with love
[time=552] We sing this song to mother with love
[time=563] With love
[time=571] [APPLAUSE]
[time=580] A long time ago God made man and just if you've heard he needed a helper And that's when mother appeared on the scene If you look in the dictionary you will find that mother is defined as the female parent But I think that's quite an understatement For really mom needs to be a walking encyclopedia She needs to know where the sun goes that night And she needs to know all about jet airplanes She can even take a little bit of cellophane and fix cellophane tape And fix just about anything And you know one more thing about mom Her kiss is far more soothing than any aspirin for a scrape or scratch That a child might receive A mother's love is something that no one can explain
[time=639] It's filled with golden sunshine With teardrops and with pain
[time=650] A mother's love is something that's measureless and deep
[time=659] A treasure God in heaven has given us to keep
[time=669] Thank you Lord for mothers And their love so sweet May we cherish others And her love repeat Love like hers is priceless It cannot be salt Neither but with silver Nor with precious gold A mother's love will follow
[time=707] No matter where we go Oh may I love for her Lord Forever grow and grow Forever grow and grow
[time=726] Ever grow and grow
[time=733] Let's listen now to Greg Hindle as he recites the poem
[time=743] By James Riley entitled "A Boy's Mother" My mama, she's so good to me If I was good as I could be, I couldn't be as good No sir, can't any boy be good as her She loves me when I'm glad or sad She loves me when I'm good or bad And what's the funniest thing?
[time=767] She says she loves me when she punishes I don't like her to punish me That don't hurt, but it hurts to see her crying Then I cry and we both cry and be good again She loves me when she cuts and sos My little cloak and send it close And when my paw come home to tea She loves him most as much as me She laughs and tells him all I said And grabs me up and pats my head And I hug her and hug my paw And love him pertinent as much as mom
[time=809] Others you have a great responsibility in raising your children You take comfort in the fact that God has provided a guide And that's the Bible, God's holy word Teach your children the stories found within its pages And discover his guidelines for living within its chapters And build your life on the foundation of its truths Then you and your family will be able to weather the storms that come into your life
[time=839] [MUSIC] Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear [MUSIC] Things I would ask him to tell me if he were here [MUSIC] Scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea [MUSIC] Stories of Jesus tell them to me [MUSIC] First let me hear how the children stood round his knee [MUSIC] And I shall fancy his blessing resting on me [MUSIC] First ball of kindness, deeds full of grace [MUSIC] All in the love right of Jesus' face [MUSIC] Tell me the stories of Jesus I love to hear [MUSIC]
[time=930] We'd like to read to you now a letter representative of daughters who cannot be with their mothers today.
[time=936] Let's listen.
[time=940] Dear Mom, this year I can't be home for Mother's Day and it hurts me.
[time=946] I wish I could fly across the miles to be with you, but I can't.
[time=951] Instead, I send this letter of thanks. Thanks for watching over me, even when I wanted to be left alone.
[time=959] Thanks for understanding that I didn't mean to lie about the candy I stole from the cupboard.
[time=964] I was only five, you know, and too scared to confess.
[time=969] Thanks for getting me a new graduation dress even when you couldn't afford it.
[time=974] Thanks for being firm and meaning know when you said it, and for spanking me when I needed it.
[time=982] Thanks for being tender.
[time=984] Once I got mad and rode off on my bike as fast as I could get away, when I came home with skin knees,
[time=991] you were there with first aid cream and bandages.
[time=995] Thanks for teaching me about God.
[time=998] You taught me that He's both good and kind and that He's also holy and hates sin.
[time=1006] Thank you so much for introducing me to the Savior.
[time=1011] Thanks for letting me see a happy Christian marriage, a home where Christ is the head.
[time=1017] When the time came for my marriage and a home of my own, I knew that both my husband and I had to juice Jesus Christ as the head.
[time=1027] Thanks for loving me when I was unlovable, and that was a lot of times.
[time=1033] Mother, I pray that I will be a godly parent to this newborn baby, our first child, with lots of love, your daughter.
[time=1048] Mom, God wants the very best, the absolute best, for your life.
[time=1054] You've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. I encourage you to do that.
[time=1059] For that won't only affect your eternal destiny, but it'll affect the future of your family.
[time=1065] As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.
[time=1073] When God made this great universe, He had a wondrous plan.
[time=1085] He took some dust and gave it life and thus created man.
[time=1091] And from this man, He took a rib and made a helper grant.
[time=1097] And she turned became the former mother of the land.
[time=1122] God knew that man could not do all the things and must be done.
[time=1128] He needed mothers to complete the work he had begun.
[time=1134] We love our dads and what they do must not be minimized.
[time=1140] But to all mothers listening now our love is verbalized.
[time=1147] To mother with love, to mother with love.
[time=1153] We sing this song, to mother with love.
[time=1160] To mother with love, to mother with love.
[time=1166] We sing this song, to mother with love.
[time=1177] With love.
[time=1183] (Applause)
[time=1194] Today on this very special day, it's our privilege to say to each of the mothers that we sincerely hope and wish for you a most delightful and happy Mother's Day.
[time=1205] Mothers are probably the most overworked and underestimated and under-appreciated people
[time=1211] that have ever walked the face of the earth.
[time=1213] It's our privilege today to at least take a moment and recognize the love and the labor of mothers
[time=1219] and to wish you all a very happy Mother's Day.
[time=1222] Pete, how are you this morning?
[time=1224] I'm fine, Rick. I had the privilege last night of calling my mom and wishing her a happy Mother's Day.
[time=1228] I really do love her and I love her for the fact that she loves the Lord and reared our family and the fear and admonition of the Lord.
[time=1236] I mentioned to this to you earlier, but you needed someone to put the fear of the Lord in you.
[time=1240] It's a good thing she was around, yes.
[time=1242] She did a good job too.
[time=1243] Not to mention your mother, Rick, how did she do?
[time=1245] She had some difficult days.
[time=1247] I'm sure that she's glad that I'm grown and gone on some of those days.
[time=1251] Well today, because it's Mother's Day, we have been encouraging you to write so that we can have the opportunity
[time=1257] of sending back to you a little booklet entitled "Motherhood." It helps as you smile.
[time=1263] We want to send this as our Mother's Day gift to you.
[time=1266] If you have been a mother and your children are grown and gone, then I'm sure this booklet will be a humorous reflection for you.
[time=1274] If you're like the hawks in the Kobees and you still have children at home, it may be a timely smile.
[time=1280] Motherhood, it helps if you smile.
[time=1282] It comes from a favorite author of many of ours, Dr. James Dobson.
[time=1286] Dr. Dobson has a ministry called Focus on the Family.
[time=1290] He has collected stories and had one of his editors compile those stories into what I know will be a great encouragement to each of you.
[time=1299] To be quite honest, I'm obviously not a mother, but I enjoyed it a great deal.
[time=1303] I think you did too.
[time=1304] It was very interesting, Rick, and we'd like to encourage all of you to write.
[time=1307] You can just use the title "Motherhood" and write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1314] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1318] Just ask for the booklet entitled "Motherhood" right to the Bible Hour, box 15,000.
[time=1324] Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip is 46815.
[time=1328] Today we are looking forward to another Mother's Day tradition here at Blackhawk.
[time=1334] Tonight in our evening service is our children's musical.
[time=1337] I have the privilege of knowing a little bit more about it because my wife has been involved in leading that,
[time=1343] and if you have children or if you just enjoy children, you're going to love the Sunday evening service tonight at 6 o'clock,
[time=1351] and we want to invite you to join us.
[time=1353] The music, I'm sure, will be a good point of release and relaxation at the end of the day,
[time=1359] and draw our focus onto our Heavenly Father.
[time=1362] And then we'll take just a few moments to talk about our Heavenly Home, and we want to encourage you to join us tonight at 6 o'clock.
[time=1370] Next Sunday night is even a bigger and more special night for us.
[time=1374] Pete, you have the premiere of the new choir album.
[time=1377] Well, Rick, we finally completed the project that we began last fall.
[time=1381] We've recorded a record entitled "Celebration of Praise," and we're going to premiere that record next Sunday night, May 18th at 6 p.m. here in the Convocation Center.
[time=1391] The choir is very excited about the project.
[time=1394] We have great music, and they did an outstanding job, and I think it's not going to be good technically, but it really has a message and something that every family should have in their home.
[time=1405] Well, we're looking forward to Sunday night tonight and next week, and hope you can join us.
[time=1410] Now as we go back to our Morning Worship service, we hope that you have your heart and your Bible open to study God's Word.
[time=1416] And use it to honor the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for His name.
[time=1427] [MUSIC] I've seen a mother's tenderness [MUSIC] I've seen the warmth of her caress [MUSIC] I've seen her children being blessed [MUSIC] That's a mother's love [MUSIC] I've seen her smile when things go wrong [MUSIC] I've heard her sing a children song [MUSIC] And in her shelters being strong [MUSIC] That's a mother's love [MUSIC] A mother's love is like an island [MUSIC] In life's ocean vast and wide [MUSIC] Offering a peaceful quiet shelter [MUSIC] From the wind the rain the tide [MUSIC]
[time=1501] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=1578] Thank you, Kevin.
[time=1584] God, we thank you for her mother's love.
[time=1587] Most of us today, God, have the privilege of reflecting back and remembering the tender love of a mother.
[time=1595] We today have, as a nation, said, "This day is a day for mothers." And so, God, we give you thanks for our mothers, and yet we give the glory to you because you are the giver of life and you are the one who has designed the unit of a family with its structure and its support.
[time=1614] But, God, today, thank you for those carrying hands in that tender heart.
[time=1620] We would pray today for the mothers, not only this congregation, but mothers in general, that they today might find in the role of a mother great worth and dignity.
[time=1632] And in these days, when the role of women is so often maligned, may we sense your value system and the joy of being a mother and of being the one who would inculcate not only love but values into the life of a young one.
[time=1650] Thank you, God, for your plan and how fearfully and wonderfully you have made us, not only physically but emotionally, that those cords of bonds can so guide our lives.
[time=1661] Father, today, we would pray for those mothers who are suffering for those who have lost a child, and their hurt is deep.
[time=1672] For those today who will sit around the table, but mother will not be there because this past year, she has gone home to be with you.
[time=1682] We pray today for those in our body who are suffering today because on Mother's Day, their family will not be its joyful self because divorce has fractured not only the family but that heart of a family.
[time=1699] God, only you can mend the broken hearts of a wife and a mother who have been rejected.
[time=1706] So, God, today, while half of us rejoice, we meet with great expectation.
[time=1712] The other half suffers and we suffer with them.
[time=1715] Through your word today, God, give us insight into your heart.
[time=1720] Make us more like you and less like ourselves for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1727] [AMEN] Mother's Day is always an exciting day, isn't it?
[time=1733] It's that one day of the year that those of us of the opposite gender try to take some type of responsibility that we normally don't take.
[time=1742] We go the extra mile.
[time=1744] A number of years ago, in our very traditional Mother's Day plan,
[time=1750] as the father of my three children, we were all going to take Mother out for dinner on lunch on Sunday.
[time=1758] And I was irresponsible. I blew it. I didn't get reservations.
[time=1762] So, we went and we stood in line and we stood in line and we stood in line.
[time=1766] Last year, I was responsible. I got us reservations.
[time=1769] And we went and we stood in line and we stood in line and we stood in line.
[time=1774] Mother's Day, oh, it's exciting.
[time=1777] Last year, I was going to beat the cry. I was going to be smart.
[time=1781] I mean, you're not looking at any average dummy.
[time=1783] As far as dummies go, I'm ahead of the pack.
[time=1786] This year, surprise, prime the kids. Nobody tells.
[time=1790] This year, we're not going to stand in line. I hate standing in line.
[time=1794] We're going to take Mom out for breakfast on Mother's Day.
[time=1799] Isn't that a good idea?
[time=1801] Now, to those of you who are fathers of three small children, a few suggestions. Do not get up early.
[time=1808] Dress your kids for church and then take them out to breakfast without having a good hour to take them back home to change their clothes before church.
[time=1818] If you see my kids today, please do not think poorly of their Mother's skills.
[time=1823] It was their father's bad plan.
[time=1826] Reminds me of the story of the little boy who really wasn't all that well kept.
[time=1830] He showed up for school.
[time=1832] The teacher saw a little food on his face and said, "Johnny, I bet I know what you had for breakfast.
[time=1838] What?" said Johnny.
[time=1840] "I bet you had fried eggs." Johnny said, "Huh-uh. That was yesterday." Well, if you see my son today, that was today.
[time=1852] Mother's Day is a tough day on all of us, isn't it?
[time=1857] It's not only a tough day on the men and our poor strategy, but it's a tough day on mothers because usually we get these messages about Super Mom.
[time=1867] Or we open up the card and that description of Mom inside that card, the ten best mothers in America put together didn't live up to that stuff.
[time=1877] And all that kind of works counter-productively that more often than feeling good, we feel guilt.
[time=1883] But I love this. It comes from Jim Dobson's magazine, Focus on the Family, as he's quoting Patricia Rushford.
[time=1892] She writes, "So often our impressions of real motherhood is mixed up with myth-taken identity of what we think Mom ought to be.
[time=1902] Every year on the second Sunday in May, we set aside a day to honor mothers everywhere.
[time=1909] Never mind that your family tells you, "Leave the dishes today, Mom. It's Mother's Day.
[time=1915] You shouldn't be working. You can wash 'em tomorrow." And try not to mourn the fact that secretaries and pickles receive a full week of national acclaim
[time=1927] while we mothers like groundhogs get but one day.
[time=1931] Mother's Day. It's an exciting time, isn't it?
[time=1935] All of us grow up with expectations. One lady gave me this quote of a woman's expectations.
[time=1942] Her expectations go like this as they change throughout the years.
[time=1946] To grow up, to fill out, to firm it up, to keep it in, to forget it.
[time=1956] That doesn't belong to the female gender only.
[time=1959] I'm somewhere between firming it up and holding it in.
[time=1963] And holding it in seems to be the predominant role.
[time=1967] Expectations. All of us have expectations, don't we?
[time=1971] Mother's Day is the day that we talk about some of those noble goals and those great expectations.
[time=1979] I think men and women are alike in that each of us have three very basic expectations.
[time=1986] There are some who would be an exception to this rule but not many.
[time=1990] Most of us have these three very simple expectations.
[time=1995] To marry, to have children, and to grow old in the loving companionship of our children.
[time=2004] I know that God gives a gift of singleness and satisfaction to some and some in this body possess them.
[time=2011] But for most of us from Adam and Eve on, our expectations have been to marry and to have children and to grow old.
[time=2021] For most of us today Mother's Day is an exciting day and we rejoice with that.
[time=2026] At the same time for many today is a sad day.
[time=2030] And I'd like us today to, with an empathetic heart, think of four mothers today,
[time=2036] who Mother's Day is a mixed blessing.
[time=2040] The first is a mother like Sarah.
[time=2046] She's really not a mother. You see, she's a would-be mother.
[time=2050] She would love to have children. She has prayed for children.
[time=2054] The hope and expectation of her life and perhaps the life of her husband is to have children.
[time=2059] But she like Abraham and Sarah of old have not had children.
[time=2065] You know, the Bible says that children are a blessing.
[time=2069] There are days that we agree with that and there are days that we hold that up for debate.
[time=2074] But listen to the words of the Psalmist. Psalm 127 verses 4 and 5, 3, 4 and 5.
[time=2084] Sons are a heritage from the Lord. Children are reward from Him.
[time=2091] Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are a son in one's youth.
[time=2098] Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they are contended with their enemies in the gate.
[time=2108] It says children are a reward of the Lord. I have to admit, that is so true.
[time=2114] Kathy and I have three delightful little children, but to be honest, we like most parents find them a bit wearing at times.
[time=2123] And we have the occasion quite often of leaving town going somewhere to serve at a Bible conference or something for a day or two and leaving our children with family or friends.
[time=2133] And as those days draw near, we say, ah, Friday, we leave the kids and just two days, just the two of us won't be great.
[time=2140] The other one responds, ah, it'll be great. Nobody in the back seats in. He's on my side.
[time=2145] He touched mine and we say, ah, it'll be great. You know, we'll just love that.
[time=2150] When we say goodbye to the kids and we smile at each other and we get in the car and drive for three hours and say, what do you think the kids are doing?
[time=2157] There's something about us, isn't there? Those little children that wear so hard, they really are. They're a gift of the Lord.
[time=2163] Look at Proverbs 17-6 one time. Proverbs 17-6.
[time=2170] This is for the older generation. It says children's children are a crown to the age and parents are the pride of their children.
[time=2180] It says children's children. Those are grandchildren are a crown to the age.
[time=2186] I don't know if there's anyone more proud than a grandmother or grandfather at the birth of that little baby and the joy they have of seeing their children's children.
[time=2197] It's part of the way God made us. We are interpersonal beings and we love our children and we love our children's children.
[time=2206] I've seen many of you with your grandchildren. I asked one friend, why is it you love your grandchildren so much?
[time=2211] He said, ah, they're great. He said, you take them, you hold them, you love them, you squeeze them and then you give them back.
[time=2218] It's great. You know, you just take them for a little bit and then you can give them back.
[time=2223] One friend said to me, you know what the prettiest lights in the world are? They're the tail lights of the car taking your grandchildren home.
[time=2232] Kathy and I were gone for three weeks as you know on a missions trip and we missed our children and coming into Cleveland Hopkins Airport there are four people anxious to see us.
[time=2243] The three kids in my father-in-law who had him for the last ten days. I'm not sure who is the most thankful to see us. The kids are my father-in-law.
[time=2252] But there's a joy in life, isn't there? Children. All they are demanding. They always want wish or need something.
[time=2261] They have endless lists of expectations and you know what? You take them out of your life for a moment.
[time=2268] And there's a hole. There's a hole. And there's a number of people who that hole is permanent.
[time=2277] But you see, they've prayed for children. They've loved children. And they've never had them.
[time=2283] And they've heard it's great. They're the seras of this world.
[time=2288] Turn with me if you will to 1 Samuel, chapter 1. And we'll meet another woman who, like Sarah, had no children.
[time=2296] And the text just gives us such insight into the needs of this woman.
[time=2303] Stories about a woman by the name of Hannah. She was married to a husband who was a mixed blessing.
[time=2309] His name was Elkhana. Elkhana was basically a good man and he truly loved Hannah.
[time=2315] But he was a man of his times and he was a polygamist. He had more than one wife.
[time=2321] The story goes in verse 3.
[time=2324] Year after year, this man went up from his town to worship and to sacrifice to the Lord Almighty at Shiloh, where Haftni and Phineas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the Lord.
[time=2337] Whenever the day came for Elkhana to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife, Penaiah, and to all of her sons and daughters.
[time=2347] But to Hannah, he gave a double portion because he loved her and the Lord had closed her womb.
[time=2357] And because the Lord had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
[time=2366] This went on year after year.
[time=2370] Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
[time=2378] Elkhana, her husband, would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted?
[time=2390] Don't I mean more to you than 10 sons?" Can you feel for this dear woman?
[time=2399] Hear the design of her very life. By God, he designed her to be of a heart to one children and she wanted children.
[time=2408] But she not only lived with that whole in her own heart that she wanted children but had none, but she was married to a man who was a polygamist who had another wife.
[time=2419] And if you'll notice, it says that this woman had sons, plural, and daughters, plural.
[time=2429] And so daily there was the constant reminder not only that she had none, but she was in a world of competition and the competition was winning.
[time=2442] Her husband was a compensating man. It says that he loved her and he also understood that she wanted children.
[time=2451] And so he tried to make up for that whole with maybe a little extra attention, a little extra of the sacrificial means to say,
[time=2459] "I know that this animal was sacrificing it was for me and for you, for my other wife and all of these kids, but I know the whole in your heart and I care."
[time=2469] And then he tries to become logical, aren't men logical, cold, calculating, and logical.
[time=2477] And so he's going to appeal to her logically. And he poses a series of questions.
[time=2485] Hannah, why are you weeping? He knew why she was weeping. Hannah, why don't you eat? He knew why she wasn't eating.
[time=2493] Hannah, just take a little. You'll feel so much better. He was an American, apparently. He thought food solved every problem.
[time=2500] Just eat a little something. You'll feel better, really. He said, "Why are you so down-hearted?"
[time=2506] But now here comes the logical male mind. Mrs. the whole hurt, but boy, we're logical.
[time=2512] He says, "Am I not better to you than ten sons?" Men, we have a way of asking questions that no one on earth can possibly win.
[time=2522] If she says, "Yes, you're better to me than ten sons." Okay, eat, quit crying. Let's get gone.
[time=2530] I mean, that's how our logical minds work, isn't it, men? I'll be thankful for what you got.
[time=2535] So if she says, "Yes," then you're instantly supposed to get over all these negative feelings.
[time=2540] And if she says, "No," then the ball changes from her hurts to his. "Oh, what? I'm not better than ten sons.
[time=2547] You know, now the whole focus shifts." You know what we need more than information often is empathy.
[time=2556] You know, there are things in life that don't change. For Hannah, it changes. She was a miracle, but miracles are miracles because they're miracles.
[time=2563] Does that make sense? Miracles are miracles, not because they happen every day all the time.
[time=2569] They're miracles because they're the unusual. And most of us greet a need with great information.
[time=2577] I'll tell you what you need to do. You know, people really don't often need to be told what they need to do.
[time=2584] They usually have a pretty good handle on that. And when they're suffering, you really need to hear that someone cares.
[time=2591] Many of you are the seras or the Hannahs. You've wanted children, but you couldn't have them.
[time=2598] For me to say that I know how you feel, obviously, isn't true. God's blessed our home with three children.
[time=2604] Not in them we're actually planned for, but we should rejoice in each of them. I don't know how you feel.
[time=2611] But today I believe the Word of God says He cares.
[time=2615] And He looks down upon what the Scripture calls the barren womb. Turn with me, if you will, to Psalm 113 in verse 9.
[time=2625] Psalm 113. I'm going to start reading in verse 7. It says of the Lord, "He raises the poor from the dust.
[time=2636] He lifts up the needy from the ash eed. He seats them with princes, with the princes of their people.
[time=2644] He settles the barren womb in her home as happy mother of children."
[time=2655] Difficult passage to interpret. I believe what the Bible is really saying here is that God can be your sufficiency.
[time=2665] God often does the miraculous and He gives the barren womb a child. He occasionally takes the pauper and makes him a prince.
[time=2678] But I think really this passage is saying God will take the one that's needy and he'll be sufficient for that one's need.
[time=2686] He'll take the one who is poor and he'll be sufficient for that one's need. And he'll take the mother who wants children and has none.
[time=2696] And he'll make her as though she did have children. He'll give her a sense of fulfillment and happiness in life, though her basic plan has not been met.
[time=2709] All of us have needs. And we usually start at the biological end of the spectrum, but you and I, we're more than biology.
[time=2718] There's a soul, a spirit, a you inside the you that the rest of us see. And it has needs, too.
[time=2726] It has the need for companionship and the need for intimacy, the need for feeling of being significant, a need of security.
[time=2735] And most of us have a ingrained paternal need.
[time=2740] I believe what God is saying here is that he'll meet those needs, that if that needs somehow goes unmet, he can make your life full.
[time=2751] Because you know you can have children and think that if I could just have child, then I will fulfill this structure of my interpersonal needs.
[time=2760] And then we have the children, and we're still not fulfilled. God says I'll be sufficient for you.
[time=2768] I don't know why God would allow someone who doesn't want children to have them, and someone who wants them doesn't have them.
[time=2778] It's obviously because the whole world, because of sin, is out of balance.
[time=2783] But God says I'm not going to remake the world just for you.
[time=2788] But I love you enough that I'll remake you on the inside and give you the grace that's sufficient.
[time=2796] Today our hearts go to those sares, those hannas, those Elizabeths who wanted children and have them not, that God would be sufficient.
[time=2807] He may use you in some extraordinary way as he used others who wanted children.
[time=2812] People like Henrietta Mirrors, or you may have never heard of Henrietta Mirrors, but if there wasn't a Henrietta Mirrors, there would have probably never been a youth movement in America.
[time=2822] But here was a woman who never married, never had children, who God gave her hundreds of young people as children, and she loved them to Christ.
[time=2834] God may give you the privilege of adopting and balancing out those unwanted children so that you being available to adopt saves one more from the crime of abortion.
[time=2847] But I really don't know the why's, but I do know the how's. Because you see by God's grace he says I'll be sufficient for you Sarah, for you Elizabeth, for you Hannah, I'll be sufficient.
[time=2864] There's a second mother that today is Mother's Day, and it is not a good day, it is a sad day. These are the Mary's, like Mary and Joseph, who suffered the untimely death of a son or a daughter.
[time=2883] There's an old Chinese proverb that the student came to the master, and he said to the master, "Master, what is happiness?" Much to the surprise of the student, the master said, "Happiness is grandfather die, father die, son die."
[time=2901] Perplexed the student said, "How can that be happiness?" And the master said, "Because that is the natural order of things."
[time=2913] You see, each of us expect that someday we will bury our parents. We try to close that thought out of our mind, but the reality of life teaches us that probably we will walk that path.
[time=2928] We see those beloved parents, and we notice now that the reflexes on that dad who used to be able to beat us at every sport just aren't there.
[time=2940] Then we notice that hair is either gray or gone, and we notice mom doesn't really remember things like she used to.
[time=2951] And all those are shadows of dark days that lie ahead, and we expect someday to bury our parents.
[time=2959] We fear that someday we will bury our spouse. We know one of the two of us will do that. Obviously one will bury the other, and we fear that.
[time=2971] But none of us really are prepared that we might someday walk down that cemetery path with a small casket holding one of our children.
[time=2987] Our grown son is gone to the Mary's. Mother's Day is a hard day.
[time=2998] Sometimes after you've learned to set the table for five for so many years, you just don't know how to set it for four. None of the old recipes work anymore.
[time=3014] It's a dark day for some to come to Mother's Day. Yes, they're a mother, but there's no son, or there's no daughter.
[time=3025] That was a tragic situation. In Jesus' day and in the days of the prophets, one of the most compassionate things that Christ or the prophets ever did was to give life back to dead children.
[time=3038] The widow of Zarephath's son, the Shua might son, Elijah and Elisha each raised one of those from the dead. Jarrus came with a daughter who was dead.
[time=3048] The widow of nine was taking her son to the cemetery, and Jesus brought them both back to life.
[time=3055] But a miracle is a miracle because it's a miracle. It doesn't happen that way, except when God performs a miracle.
[time=3066] But yet God says again that He'll be your sufficiency. How? I don't always know.
[time=3075] But can I just share three simple little thoughts with those of you who have lost children or those of you who may face that?
[time=3084] Maybe it'll be me in the days ahead. First of all, God does not take our children as punishment for our sins.
[time=3092] He did that once. That's David and Bathsheba lost a son.
[time=3097] But that was not God's normal plan. But you know, almost always a parent will lament, "What have I done?"
[time=3106] That God would allow this to happen. The answer is not that you've sinned, but somehow God's designed for your life and the life of that child was that their life be shorter than we expected.
[time=3120] But it's not a punishment. Don't add to the hurt that's already there the final sting of guilt because you deserve none.
[time=3129] It's part of our humanity to ask those questions, but they're not appropriate.
[time=3136] And then we have the hope of eternal life. Mary is gone. She's gone from George.
[time=3148] But today she's with Steve, a son who was killed in a car accident, and a daughter, Mary Ann, who was born and died of defective birth conditions.
[time=3159] There's reunion. God says life doesn't end at that grave and there's reunion. David, when he lost his son, he mourned.
[time=3169] And then when he learned that the son had finally died, he rose and they said, "David, aren't you going to mourn that the child died?"
[time=3175] He said, "No, the time for praying is over. The child's gone. He won't ever come to me. But someday I'll go to him."
[time=3183] There's reunion. And between now and then God's grace.
[time=3189] You see, the early church lost a lot of children. You may not have known that.
[time=3193] But you see, the Romans had a hideous way of making people subscribe to the emperor and denounce Christ.
[time=3201] You might be strong enough to resist pain being inflicted upon you, but what if they did it to your children?
[time=3208] They were hideous. They would take little children and they would dress the children in sheep skins.
[time=3215] And then they would sprinkle a little fresh blood on the sheep skins.
[time=3219] Then they would send these children to the arena and then they would release into the arena, the predators, the lions and the wolves.
[time=3228] And the Christians would watch their children being eaten alive.
[time=3232] Well, that's hideous. What do you write to a group of people like this?
[time=3239] I can tell you how Paul began. Every comment that he began was almost always grace to you.
[time=3248] We think of grace as the extra on top of all the good things of life. God even gives grace.
[time=3253] Life's kind of a banana split for most others, and grace is a little cherry right there on the top.
[time=3259] But you know, for most people, grace is the bananas. It's the survival.
[time=3266] It's the bottom line that keeps going.
[time=3270] Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all.
[time=3276] Yes, all my sin, but all my need.
[time=3279] We heard Larnell Harrison two weeks ago, beautifully, majestically.
[time=3284] Grace, the grace of God, greater than all my need.
[time=3292] That doesn't say that God takes the whole and he fills it with grace, but grace becomes the anesthetic that numbs the pain and carries the hurt.
[time=3307] God said, "I'll give you the grace to bear it." There's a third mother who suffers today. It's the woman of Solomon's Day. We're running out of time.
[time=3317] But you remember the story, two mothers in the same house, one crushes her baby, then later takes her baby that has died and switches it with another baby.
[time=3325] Do you remember that story? Can you imagine the grief and the guilt of a mother who either knowingly or unknowingly took the life of her child?
[time=3335] There are probably another million point five of those women this year who knowingly took the life of their children through a surgical procedure we call abortion.
[time=3345] I need to say this with balance. Abortion is wrong.
[time=3351] Life begins a conception. In the womb, God is involved, fearfully and wonderfully making us.
[time=3359] And we never want to lower that standard. But we also need to say that if you had an abortion, God's grace is able to forgive that too.
[time=3371] Marv, I'm so thankful for that letter you wrote to Dr. Dobson.
[time=3376] Dr. Eastlin had the wisdom to tell a patient that wanted another child because she had aborted the first one that what she really didn't need was a child, but what she really needed is forgiveness.
[time=3386] You may have been the man that paid for the abortion. You may have been the man who said, "Honey, if you love me, you'll let me."
[time=3393] And then after she let you, you said, "Honey, if you'll love me, you'll get an abortion." And you paid for it.
[time=3398] God said, "I can forgive that." That doesn't lessen the reality, but God says, "I can forgive."
[time=3406] You can know forgiveness in Christ today. He can wash away any sin, any sin, anything if you'll come to Him.
