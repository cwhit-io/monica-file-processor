[time=29] - Good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=32] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Lane, Indiana, it's the Bible Hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=47] Join us, won't you, for the Bible Hour.
[time=51] (uplifting music)

[time=192] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=411] Thank you, choir, honor the Lord with your song of praise.
[time=421] We've gathered this morning in this place to lift up the name of our God, and to say, "He is worthy of all praise and all glory and honor." The song that we've just heard is the first song on an album our choir has recorded, and tonight our entire evening service will be a presentation of music just like you've heard, that honors the Lord.
[time=442] I hope that you can join us tonight at six o'clock for a celebration of praise.
[time=446] But you're here this morning.
[time=447] We thank God that you've come to worship with us, and we trust that today there'll be growth in each of our lives through the worship of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=457] Also, we want to say a word of welcome to our friends who join us now for the Bible hour, and we trust that whether you're at home or in a hospital or in this place, that you will sense the greatness and the goodness of our God.
[time=470] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning.
[time=472] Take out your hymn books, and we'll sing together again the fact that Jesus Christ is alive, He lives.
[time=478] I serve a risen Savior, He's in the world today.
[time=482] Take your hymn books, and Pete will lead us as we worship through singing.
[time=486] Him number 377, we'll sing all three stanzas of He lives.
[time=497] I serve a risen Savior, He's in the world today.
[time=523] He is in the world today.
[time=529] He does what we have asked, He does what I serve away.
[time=536] He is in the world today, He's in the world today.
[time=543] He does what we have asked, He's in the world today.
[time=549] He is in the world.
[time=558] In all the world among me, I see His light.
[time=570] I know my heart grows weary, I never will descend.
[time=576] I know that He is leading us for Christ.
[time=582] He lives in this Christ Jesus Christ.
[time=587] He walks with me, I know.
[time=591] I know that He is leading us for Christ.
[time=609] He lives within one heart.
[time=619] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice.
[time=651] I know that He is leading us for Christ.
[time=665] I know that He lives within one heart.
[time=681] Thank you for that great song of testimony that Jesus indeed dwells in your heart.
[time=687] Each year in the spring of the season, the general association of regular Baptist churches, of which Blackhawk is a part, has a teen talent contest throughout the state.
[time=696] Last week, this contest was held in Brian Zuck competed in the Piano Division of the contest,
[time=702] and we are happy to say that he won first place and will go on now to Grand Rapids, Michigan in June
[time=709] to represent Blackhawk and the state of Indiana in the national contest.
[time=714] Brian is a sophomore at Blackhawk Christian School and a member of Blackhawk Baptist Church and an active in our youth program.
[time=721] We're delighted at his accomplishments and the ministry and the ability that he has on the piano.
[time=726] Let's listen to him now as he plays for us. We shall behold him.
[time=749] [MUSIC - 219 seconds]
[time=977] [APPLAUSE]
[time=985] Thank you, Rick. We did begin our album with that great song. It just kind of connotes the entire theme of the record. We wanted to honor and praise the Lord with the music.
[time=1002] We finally received the completed record this week. It's entitled "Celebration of Praise." Tonight we premiere that particular record.
[time=1011] I'm looking forward to the evening service tonight at six o'clock. The whole service will be dedicated to our choir presenting the album of "Celebration of Praise." And that's going to be a great night.
[time=1022] It's a great combination, Rick, of some of the very familiar hymns of the church. Amazing grace is on there. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty. There's some medleys that include works from Handel, one of the great classic composers, and it's just a great variety. And as I said before,
[time=1040] I'm delighted at the way the choir worked to produce the quality of the album, but we're equally delighted at the spiritual impact that it can have for all of us.
[time=1050] Tonight, that premiere is at six o'clock here in the auditorium of the Black Hawk Baptist Church. And if you do not have a church home or your church does not have an evening service, I want to give you my strongest encouragement to join us tonight.
[time=1065] This is a night that will be second to none as we lift up the name of the Lord. Musically, it's going to be excellent, but spiritually, the impact will be great, and we don't want you to miss it.
[time=1076] We are located on East State Boulevard, just half a mile, or a mile past Georgetown Shopping Center at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and we'd love to have you come tonight at six o'clock. Thanks for the hard work that went into that album.
[time=1090] Thank you, Rick, and we wanted to give our invitation, too, to have you join with us in celebration with the choir. That's tonight at six o'clock at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1100] Rick, we were discussing some of the pamphlet that we are offering on the Bible hour today, and there are certainly some humorous passages in that booklet.
[time=1109] The title is "Motherhood." It helps if you smile, and the encouragement of the Word of God is that laughter does good for the soul-like medicine.
[time=1119] And some days, we just have to find some reasons to laugh. We'd like to send you this booklet, and I would need to confess to you that it's not just for mothers. Pete and I have laughed a great deal this morning as we've reflected on some of the stories being told here.
[time=1134] Let me just share one of these with you. You know it's going to be a bad day when you call suicide prevention, and they put you on hold.
[time=1143] Or you see a 60-minute news team in your office. I hope neither one of us ever see that. This one's for you, Pete.
[time=1150] Your birthday cake collapses from the weight of the candles on it. Oh, that was low. I'm approaching that point.
[time=1157] This is really even worse, though, when your twin sister forgets your birthday. You know it's going to be a bad day.
[time=1163] But this is one that has to give all of us nightmares. You're following a group of Hells Angels down the freeway when suddenly your horn goes off and remains stuck.
[time=1173] Could you imagine that? No, really, I didn't mean that.
[time=1177] Well, this is a great pamphlet of family stories as well. There's a story Jim Dobson tells in here about a mother who was having trouble with her toddler.
[time=1187] And the toddler and the little bit older sister discovered that mom had discovered the fine ancient art of a swift paddle to remedy some situations.
[time=1197] The little girl figured out that that idea came from Jim Dobson's book called Dare to Discipline. And the next morning after the first paddling, the mother got out and discovered the book had been discarded in the toilet by the little girl.
[time=1209] Well, I don't know if your kids are as sharp as mine, but they figure things out. And if you don't go in the next room and laugh, you probably won't make it.
[time=1217] We'd like to send you a copy of this. If you'll simply write to us, it's our May gift from us to you. Simply write to us today at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1230] Our zip code is 46815. Again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1243] Simply write to us today and ask for the booklet on Smiles, Our Motherhood. We'll know what you mean by either one of those simple titles, and we'll get it to you as quickly as we can.
[time=1254] Speaking of Dr. Dobson, the author of this pamphlet, coming in the summer months, we'll be having a film series entitled Turning Your Heart Towards Home.
[time=1264] And on Memorial Day weekend, Sunday night at 6 o'clock will be the first in that film series. So we want to encourage you to mark your calendar to spend an encouraging evening with Dr. Dobson by way of film on next Sunday at 6 o'clock.
[time=1279] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour. As we go back to the Morning Worship Service, we hope that the Ministry of Music and the Ministry of God's Word have a great strengthening effect on your spiritual life.
[time=1309] If there is no choice in him, he will rule by might forever. He keeps watch on all the lands. Bless the Lord with all your peace. Raise your voices, clap your hands.
[time=1327] Joyfully to God, sing the glory of his name. Shout his praises evermore. He alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of his name.
[time=1355] And hear what God has done, healing body, mind and soul through the working of his power, making us completely whole. Certainly he hears us praying. Come Lord Jesus, quickly come.
[time=1373] All the earth will worship you. Sing your praise almighty one. Shout joyfully to God. Sing the glory of his name. Shout his praises evermore.
[time=1392] He alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of his. Shout joyfully to God. Sing the glory of his name. Shout his praises evermore. He alone will never change.
[time=1441] Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of his name.
[time=1465] Thank you, Marilyn. Shout the glory of his name. Music has such a power to invigorate and energize us. And I know why David put Psalm 150 by the inspiration of God right into that book of Psalms, that were to make a joyful noise under the Lord and to praise him on the loud symbol on the flute on the drum on the lyre. The shout is goodness.
[time=1488] God, we shout today for joy for your blessing. Some days we in our relentless pursuit for more walk away with an empty feeling, but when we stop in a morning like this and think of who you are and all we have, our hearts yell shout for joy.
[time=1505] God, we love you. And today we unashamedly declare that with the strength of our being, we shout the goodness of our God. You are worthy of praise and our heart leaps for joy when we think of your gift of eternal life and to know that we shall forever be with you.
[time=1523] To know that you're coming again and there'll be a day when we shall behold him, him, Jesus, our Savior, who reigns forevermore. God, today, we thank you that we have the freedom in this land and the prosperity of these resources to worship you.
[time=1542] God, our hearts are full and we shout with joy today. Father, through your word, we would want to have not only the emotion of music, but the substance of Scripture, that our words might today be anchored in your word so that our lives might be anchored on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1561] We would pray today that through your word, each of us would grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus. We thank you for the answers to prayers. We thank you today that Gloria Stidel is recovered and is strong from a surgery.
[time=1576] That Linda Hatfield has come through open heart surgery and the reports are well. We thank you that Jim Pearson's father has successfully undergone brain surgery. We pray for him and for Linda's father and for others who are battling cancer.
[time=1592] We today pray for those who've walked through some valley experiences for Mike and for Judy and for Dave, for Michelle and Tonya. We would pray that you would encourage those who just found that recently their emotional strength hasn't been strong.
[time=1611] We pray for those today who wrestle with the deep hurts of spouses or children who are in rebellion to you and that rebellion has brought destruction to a home. God help us today to see your grace as being sufficient for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1633] A little girl was asked in Sunday school class if she knew the story of Adam and Eve. A little girl said, "Sure, I know that story." God took six days to make everything and the last thing he made was Adam. And God looked at Adam and said, "Hmm, I can do better than that and then he made Eve."
[time=1653] Well, let's open the Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and we'll discover some of God's plans for Adam and Eve men and women today. God by design has given us his word. There's been a long standing humor that men give at the expense of women and women at the expense of men.
[time=1672] By God we are different in our body chemistry. We're different in our functions. We're different in our temperaments and our uniquenesses. What would God say about the roles of men and women? What does God really teach?
[time=1689] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verses 2 and 3. Now I praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God.
[time=1714] These first few verses are an introduction to order in the church in the verses that follow and we'll study some of them next week he'll talk about head coverings. Then he'll talk about a love feast which was an early edition of a church potluck dinner and then he'll talk about communion and maintaining a sense of order in the church by design of God.
[time=1735] But this also opens up the issue of the roles of men and women. We live in a very reactionary society. I believe more than anything else what the church of Jesus Christ needs is a thorough study of the scripture and a balanced approach.
[time=1750] There are those on the extreme edge of the old South mentality that women are to be beautiful to be seen and preferably silent, pregnant and barefoot in the summertime and in the wintertime, slaving in a hot kitchen. There's that extreme. There's those that say we could just get back to those good old days. Life would really work a lot better.
[time=1772] Then there are those that they're at the other extreme there saying ladies until you throw off the yoke of marriage and the bondage of children and until you liberate yourself and as sponge the traditional role of family, your life will never be happy and you'll never be fulfilled.
[time=1789] But somehow there's got to be balance. A psychoanalyst in Paris said that all of the women he counsels can be divided into two groups, those who work who come to him struggling with guilt and those who don't work who come to him struggling with frustration.
[time=1806] Somewhere there's got to be a balance. Somehow there's got to be an understanding that comes from the pages of God's Word and not just our own.
[time=1817] Men and women are different and different by the very design of God.
[time=1823] In this chapter, verse two, he's talking about oral teaching and verse three, now he's giving written teaching.
[time=1831] He refers to the word ordinance and that means oral teaching.
[time=1835] But before he begins what is really going to be a correction, he starts with an encouraging word.
[time=1840] Verse two, now I praise you brethren that you remembered me in all things.
[time=1847] He begins with a word of encouragement and may I share with you that if you're a leader and almost every one of us are, our spheres of influence may be big or small, but you may be a leader over children in your home.
[time=1859] You may be a leader of a home Bible study. You might be a leader over other employees in your business.
[time=1864] You might be a leader in a school production, a play or a musical or a drama. You might be a leader on an athletic team.
[time=1872] You may be a leader in government or business and industry.
[time=1876] But one of the great things that you can do as a leader is to be an encourager.
[time=1881] And Paul begins with some encouragement that they've done well.
[time=1886] A great leader is always a great encourager.
[time=1890] Never was there a great leader who didn't have the ability to take the people who were below him and to lift their spirits up.
[time=1900] Leadership is always proportional to encouragement.
[time=1904] During the darkest days perhaps of Britain's history, Neville Chamberlain had given away the farm.
[time=1912] The Germans had swallowed up most of Europe. Bombing missions were hitting London daily.
[time=1920] The threat of a Nazi invasion seemed eminent and one man came on the scene, shorter than I am.
[time=1927] More rotund had these mutton chopped cheeks that hung down.
[time=1932] Wasn't all that eloquent of a man, but Winston Churchill was an encourager.
[time=1937] And he took a nation that had lost heart and he had planted into that country a sense of encouragement and confidence and England recovered.
[time=1948] You know, you may be working in a business today that profits are down being an encourager.
[time=1955] You may have a little nest of children that drive you crazy and you find yourself constantly saying, "Don't touch that!"
[time=1965] You find yourself always wiping fingerprints, always changing diapers, always saying, "Don't put your fork in your brother's food, nor his ear."
[time=1975] And there's always one more thing, but you know if you can learn to say some positive things along with those don'ts, you'll find yourself an effective leader.
[time=1984] If you're part of a home Bible study, don't beat the people with God's word being an encourager.
[time=1990] I've never met anyone who came in and said, "Pastor, I've got to talk to you.
[time=1995] There are so many people encouraging me. I just can't take it anymore." Been here almost ten years. Hasn't happened.
[time=2003] Paul begins and he's going to have to say some corrective things, but he begins by saying, "I praise you. It's you done good."
[time=2013] Well done. That was great.
[time=2017] Oh, my kids need to hear it more. I bet yours do.
[time=2022] I bet those employees who you're constantly calling in for a performance review would love to hear you say, "You know, you've done well in this area."
[time=2030] And to spend some time talking about where they've done well.
[time=2034] Men, most women I meet are only frustrated in their roles as wives or as mothers, not because of the function, but from the lack of encouragement that comes in those roles.
[time=2046] Paul begins his corrective words by being an encourager. He says, "I praise you for what?" That they remembered what he had taught them. His ordinances were his oral teaching.
[time=2056] Paul was with the Corinthians for 18 months. You talk about a great summer Bible conference.
[time=2062] They drug it for 18 months. Paul was their teaching. You know, they'll taught them the fundamentals of the faith.
[time=2068] The new birth in Christ, of course, and the deity of Christ that is the Son of God.
[time=2074] But along the way, he probably taught to them the equality of men and women.
[time=2081] If we take a moment and take just a quick trip back into Galatians chapter 3, we'll find a revolutionary statement of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2091] And just so you'll understand chronology, Galatians was the first letter of the Apostle Paul, perhaps the first letter of the entire New Testament.
[time=2100] In Galatians 3, 28, he writes these words of revolution. There is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ.
[time=2121] Paul made in that short verse probably the most revolutionary statement of Roman and Hebrew history that he could have possibly made.
[time=2134] Both the Roman world and the Greeks who preceded them had a very rigid structure of society.
[time=2141] There were men and there were women. There were citizens of Rome and there were slaves.
[time=2153] To the Jew, there were Hebrews and disgusting Gentiles.
[time=2160] And there was a very clear and rigid social structure that if you were a petition, that's one of the fathers of Rome, one of the nobility, then you had a place of distinction.
[time=2174] And this one who was a slave was nothing. And the two would have nothing in common.
[time=2180] From the Apostle Paul says, Jesus Christ makes us one body. That when you come to the body of Christ, there aren't patricians and there aren't plebeians and there aren't slaves that all are one in Christ.
[time=2194] That was revolutionary.
[time=2198] That there weren't Jews and Gentiles. While the Jews had a temple and it had a court of Gentiles, which was simply an outer court that you could go in, but only a Jew could go into the court of Israel.
[time=2213] And there was a wall there. It was revolutionary to say that there are no longer distinctions.
[time=2221] And in both the Hebrew and the Gentile society, there were very rigid distinctions between men and women.
[time=2228] There were men and men were in charge of everything. And there were women who were literally treated in some of the more primitive cultures as chattel.
[time=2238] I didn't say chattel. Chattel means property that a person owns.
[time=2244] And in the Hebrew society, there was the concept that the woman was inferior to the man.
[time=2251] And the Apostle Paul says from a Hebrew and Roman background, no, in Christ there are men and women and we are co-equal inheritors of the grace of God.
[time=2263] That was revolutionary.
[time=2265] That shook the Roman and Hebrew world right down to its foundations.
[time=2271] And I am sure that that is the oral tradition that he is commending them for keeping.
[time=2276] Now, how do I know that? How do I know he wasn't talking that they kept the tradition that Jesus is coming?
[time=2281] Well, look at verse three. Verse three begins with a conjunction.
[time=2286] But, and a conjunction always connects the preceding with the following.
[time=2292] The word "but" is not only a conjunction, but it's a conjunction of contrast.
[time=2297] And so he wants to compare something. He says, "You've kept my oral traditions, but remember there's order."
[time=2305] There are these three orders. Christ is the head over every man.
[time=2311] The man is the head over the woman and God is the head over Christ.
[time=2315] So that conjunction of contrast tells us that they were doing well in showing women equality.
[time=2321] They were doing their right thing, but they were losing some significant orders that God had decreed.
[time=2328] So, first of all, in verse two, he's giving him this oral tradition and he's commending them for the way they are now treating women with equality in the church.
[time=2337] Unfortunately, they had apparently lost order in the church, which is no surprise for the Corinthians.
[time=2343] They lost order every time the church met.
[time=2346] There were those in this corner who said, "And in this corner the apostle Paul." And in this corner is a tag team between Cephas and Apollus, and they rang the bell.
[time=2356] And they had had it. They lost order in the church.
[time=2359] They lost order at what was called the love feast.
[time=2362] It was meant to be a potluck, carry in dinner, and it turned into a gluttonous adulterous affair.
[time=2367] They lost order. God gave temporarily to the church, the early church, speaking in tongues.
[time=2372] They lost order. They lost order in the relationship of leadership in the church as well.
[time=2379] And so now he speaks to them after an encouraging word, a corrective word as well.
[time=2386] There are some preliminary things we need to look at first.
[time=2390] First of all, the Bible recognizes four different orders within society.
[time=2396] First of all, there is a private order that I have a life as a private person.
[time=2401] You have a life. I am Rick. I'm not just Adam's daddy or Rebecca's father or Kathy's husband.
[time=2407] I'm Rick. Kathy's not just my wife. She's not Mrs. Pastor. She's Kathy.
[time=2414] And she has a private world. I have a private world.
[time=2417] You are not just someone who's part of a family, or you're not just a manager of a station.
[time=2423] You're a private person. And you have to bring your world into order.
[time=2427] You've got to balance your finances. You've got to balance your time.
[time=2431] You've got to learn to control anger. We've got to learn to handle disappointment.
[time=2435] We've got a private world. And you're accountable for you.
[time=2440] Secondly, there is a larger order. That's the family.
[time=2444] And no matter how hard Marxist Leninism tries to stamp out the family, it is always going to survive because it's God's plan and intuitively in us is an instinct for family.
[time=2455] And in the family structure, Ephesians 5 says in that structure, God has ordained an order that men are to be the leaders who initiate by love and provide for the security of the wife and the children.
[time=2469] And the women are to follow that leadership with a spirit of cooperation.
[time=2473] That is an order that God gives. Then there's a third order beyond the private and the family.
[time=2478] There is the order of what we call government. In Romans chapter 13, it says that God ordains government, that it exists by his very decree.
[time=2488] In the area of government, there is not a prohibition or a prescription that I know of
[time=2494] that sets a unique role between men and women.
[time=2497] To be honest with you, I think that that is perfectly legitimate on biblical grounds to have a woman congressman, a woman senator, and a woman president.
[time=2506] And I believe that I would vote for a woman as president if she was the better of the choices.
[time=2511] There's not anything in scripture that dictates or mitigates against that to my knowledge.
[time=2516] As a matter of fact, I think Margaret Thatcher probably might be the most courageous leader in all of Europe.
[time=2523] There's a fourth order.
[time=2525] Private, family, government, and church.
[time=2531] Chapter 11 is talking about orders within the church.
[time=2534] It's talking about praying, probably. It's talking about prophesying.
[time=2537] It's talking about communion. It's talking about love feasts.
[time=2540] It's talking about head coverings.
[time=2542] He's talking about order within the church.
[time=2545] And now he says, in the church, men have the primary responsibility to provide for leadership
[time=2552] and headship within the church.
[time=2555] Now, in verse three, he gives us three models.
[time=2559] I think he gives us three models so we can understand what headship is all about.
[time=2564] Model number one is this.
[time=2566] He says that Christ is the head of the church.
[time=2571] Ephesians is a book that speaks greatly about the headship of Christ.
[time=2576] Ephesians 1, 22, it says, and he has put all things under his feet Christ and has given Christ
[time=2584] to be the head over all things to the church.
[time=2588] Verse 4, 15 of chapter 4.
[time=2591] But speak the truth in love, that you might grow up unto him in all things which is the head even Christ.
[time=2599] Therefore, as Christ is the head of the church.
[time=2608] Too often we make the mistake of identifying the church as being something that belongs to the congregation.
[time=2615] And I've heard great sermons on congregational government and we basically function with a blend but largely congregational government.
[time=2623] Nobody buys or sells property without this congregation saying so.
[time=2627] The pastor is chosen by this congregation.
[time=2630] This congregation makes a decision to build or not to build.
[time=2633] This is congregation elects its own officials.
[time=2636] But we say this is a congregational run church.
[time=2638] Beloved, if it's a congregational run church, we're in trouble.
[time=2642] I don't know of a better congregation than this one, but we're in trouble if you're going to run the church.
[time=2648] Because you see, Christ is the head of the church.
[time=2653] Now there could be something worse than you running the church.
[time=2656] So that could be me running the church.
[time=2658] Then we're in serious trouble.
[time=2660] From time to time someone will say, "Where'd you go to church on vacation?" "Oh, I went to pastor Smith's church." Well, there are pastors I regret to inform you who do own the church.
[time=2670] I mean, they own it, lock, stock, and barrel.
[time=2672] Not only they have a key, but they own the building.
[time=2674] That's wrong.
[time=2676] But it's not my church.
[time=2678] It's not our pastoral staff church.
[time=2680] It's not our deacon church.
[time=2681] This is Christ's church.
[time=2683] And if we don't follow His headship as He speaks through the word, we're in serious trouble.
[time=2689] From time to time someone will say, "Well, we shouldn't do it that way because in business we do it this way.
[time=2694] This isn't a business." Now we can learn from business principles, but this church shouldn't be run like a business.
[time=2701] It should be run like a church in their uniquenesses.
[time=2704] I like to read management books.
[time=2706] And management books can give good insights because horse sense is horse sense.
[time=2710] And if it makes sense we ought to do it.
[time=2712] But sometimes business says something and God says something different.
[time=2716] Thank you.
[time=2718] There are two of us who agree today.
[time=2720] I can get you to do that.
[time=2722] If I can get one of the ladies to do that, it will be a good day.
[time=2725] That's the time we get done here.
[time=2728] Okay, it's God's church.
[time=2730] There's order.
[time=2731] We can't stand up and say, "I think we ought to do this." If God's word says you ought to do it different, He's the head of the church.
[time=2738] And I must submit to Him and so must you.
[time=2740] Then there's another order that's mentioned that follows.
[time=2743] There is an order that the man is to be in headship over the woman.
[time=2747] Don't say, "Man will both be in trouble." But there is that statement that the man is to be the head in the church over the woman.
[time=2756] And we're going to look at that in a moment.
[time=2758] And then thirdly, there is the order that Christ is under the headship of God.
[time=2766] Let me substantiate that point because I think that's a very important one.
[time=2771] In Matthew chapter 26, you'll remember this event.
[time=2774] It's the night in which Jesus was betrayed.
[time=2777] He goes to the Garden of Gethsemane and He's there praying.
[time=2781] And He's in anxiety mood.
[time=2784] And He says, "God, please, if it's your will, let this cup of suffering pass from me.
[time=2794] Yet, nevertheless, not my will, but thy will."
[time=2800] He was placing Himself under the headship of the Father.
[time=2804] In John chapter four, the famous conversation with the woman of the well, Samaritan woman of Saikar.
[time=2810] Jesus said to her, "My meat, my food, the thing that makes me go.
[time=2816] My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me and to finish His work."
[time=2823] Christ placed Himself under the headship of the Father.
[time=2826] John 5.30 says, "Speaking of Christ, Christ said, "I can of my own self do nothing.
[time=2835] As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will,
[time=2842] but the will of the Father which sent me." John 6.38, "For I came down from having not to do my will, but the will of the one who sent me."
[time=2851] And finally, this great statement, Philippians 2, 5, 6, and 7.
[time=2857] Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being found in the form of God, fought it not robbery to be equal with God,
[time=2867] but made Himself of no reputation, and humbled Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.
[time=2876] Christ voluntarily abdicated His unique identity of God
[time=2883] and placed Himself under the authority of the Father.
[time=2889] Now, the Bible teaches that Christ is over the Church,
[time=2895] that the Father is over the Son, and in this passage for leadership in the Church,
[time=2901] that the men are in leadership over the women.
[time=2905] It says it here. We've just read that.
[time=2908] It also says it in the use of the gift speaking in tongues, which was a temporary gift that went out with the apostles.
[time=2914] But in that situation, 1 Corinthians 14, 34 says, "The women were not to exercise that gift over the men." In 1 Timothy chapter 2, it says that the women are not to hold a position of teaching or authority
[time=2928] that exercises that as an authority over the men.
[time=2932] In 1 Timothy 3, it says that the eldership is reserved for men.
[time=2937] Now, I believe the Scripture then teaches this principle.
[time=2943] It's two things put together in one.
[time=2945] I call it the joint equality and subordination of men to women.
[time=2952] That women are, yes, subordinate in the Church to men and in the home to the husband, but also they are equal.
[time=2959] We've established, I hope, that Christ was subordinate to the Father and in a similar way, the women are to be subordinate to the men.
[time=2967] But I believe this verse also teaches the equality of women to men.
[time=2974] Let me say this, subordination does not represent inferiority.
[time=2980] Where do I get that out of this passage?
[time=2982] Because it says that Christ is under the headship of the Father.
[time=2986] And yet, He was equal to the Father.
[time=2989] The Bible makes that abundantly clear.
[time=2991] Remember, we just quoted Philippians 2 and it said, "Christ who was found in the form of God, He was God." And it was not robbery for Him to be equal with God.
[time=3001] What does that phrase mean, robbery?
[time=3003] It meant that Jesus didn't have to take anything that wasn't already His in order to be equal with God.
[time=3011] He didn't have to pick up some omniscience or He didn't have to gain some omnipresence.
[time=3016] He was equal to God without stealing a thing.
[time=3021] Jesus was nearly stoned on several occasions.
[time=3024] And each time, it was because He claimed equality with God.
[time=3028] He said, "I and the Father are one.
[time=3030] We're one in the same." Philipp said unto him, "Jesus, show us the Father and it'll be sufficient."
[time=3039] John 14, verse 9, Jesus said, "He that has seen me have seen the Father." John 1 18 says, "No man has seen the Father at any time, but they only begotten who is in the bosom of the Father.
[time=3051] He has declared him." If you've seen me, you've seen the Father, Jesus said.
[time=3056] He was absolutely equal to God, the Heavenly Father.
[time=3062] Even though He voluntarily subordinated Himself to the Father.
[time=3067] Perhaps a military illustration may help.
[time=3070] In the military, a captain is always over a private.
[time=3074] But that doesn't mean that the captain is necessarily of a higher IQ than the private.
[time=3080] It doesn't mean he has a higher moral conviction.
[time=3083] It doesn't mean that he's a better father or husband.
[time=3085] It doesn't mean that he's stronger, faster.
[time=3088] It just means he has a higher rank.
[time=3090] It just means he has been placed in a position of authority.
[time=3093] That's all that it means.
[time=3097] And it may be that in a given situation that a man is placed in leadership over the church, that doesn't mean that he's better, doesn't mean that he's superior, doesn't mean that he's smarter than the women.
[time=3107] It is simply a place that God has put him there.
[time=3110] I had to learn that humbling lesson one time in my college days.
[time=3114] I went to the University of Akron, and this will cause pain to many of you parents who are paying tuition.
[time=3120] In those days, it cost $11 an hour for a college class.
[time=3124] It's a little over 100 at most schools now.
[time=3127] And I took 11 hours.
[time=3129] That's all I needed, was 11 hours.
[time=3132] But if I took 12 hours, I was full time, and my insurance went in half.
[time=3137] So being a typical male, I decided if I was going to take one more hour of class, it would certainly be in the PE department.
[time=3144] So I opened up the brochure, and I go through the only class that I could take.
[time=3148] The only one that fit into my time slot was Beginners Swimming.
[time=3153] I had swim competitively, butterfly for four years.
[time=3158] So I went to the teacher of the class, and I explained that I already knew how to swim.
[time=3163] I just was doing it for an insurance break.
[time=3165] Could I come the last day and take the test?
[time=3167] Well, he was a macho football coach.
[time=3170] And he greeted me by saying, "Nobody cuts my classes." We're going to get along just fine.
[time=3177] I can tell that right now.
[time=3179] And I really pled with the guy.
[time=3180] You know, I really know how to swim.
[time=3182] And he said, "Just put on your swimsuit and join the rest of us." There I was, University of Akron, Natatorium, holding onto the edge of the pool in the shallow end, practicing, blowing bubbles.
[time=3193] You know, it turned him, "Oh, it was great." And I did it really well.
[time=3197] He was impressed at how well I could blow bubbles.
[time=3200] It was the most humiliating thing.
[time=3202] I was like, "Listen, you know, I used to swim competitively." And I said, "Do I have to do this?" And he said, "Every day." This has nothing to do with today's message.
[time=3213] But I can't tell you that halfway through the class, we stayed, started playing water polo, and he wasn't that good a swimmer.
[time=3219] And I had the best time of my life.
[time=3224] For those of you who are under someone's authority that you really don't like, maybe your day will come.
[time=3231] The private's not necessarily a better man than the captain, but he has that position.
[time=3236] The Akron new football coach couldn't swim nearly as well as I could, but I blew bubbles two days a week because he was an authority.
[time=3243] Didn't make him a better swimmer, didn't make him a better water world player, but it did give him the right to pass out the grades at the end of the quarter.
[time=3253] Sometimes authority is in the hands of people who may not be better than those who are under them.
[time=3261] But God says that there is order in society.
[time=3265] You may be smarter than the police officer who detected that you were speeding.
[time=3270] Take the ticket graciously.
[time=3273] You may have had more math classes than your father when he says this is your allowance, that's it.
[time=3280] You may be smarter than your husband, but honor him in your home.
[time=3284] Authority does not necessarily connote superiority.
[time=3290] It has nothing to do with who is better, who is smarter.
[time=3294] The person that is given a place of authority is not in any way superior to the people who are under them.
[time=3303] But in the Church of Jesus Christ, God has said that there is this level of leadership that he has reserved for men.
[time=3311] Not because they're better, but simply because that's the way he chose to order his church of which his son, the Lord Jesus, is the head.
[time=3320] There have been many misapplications to this.
[time=3323] Allow me to address them very, very quickly.
[time=3327] Some by way of misapplication have concluded that a woman's role is less significant.
[time=3332] Not so.
[time=3335] I don't usually have my notes typed out, but this week I ask my friend and secretary to do this.
[time=3341] It says, "Amen, preach it, brother." I didn't remember writing that, but just a little admonition to slip in there.
[time=3352] I couldn't pass that one by.
[time=3356] First of all, this principle, being a woman is a place of great distinction.
[time=3362] It really is. You're the pinnacle of creation.
[time=3365] That little girl probably changed the story a little bit, but she's right.
[time=3368] God looked at us men and he said, "I can do better than that." And he created Eve, and he did.
[time=3374] A woman is a pinnacle of creation.
[time=3377] Secondly, being a mother is a great role.
[time=3380] Society will depreciate it.
[time=3382] Men, if you will simply encourage your wife, be on her team and support her, and you'll share the mundane tasks.
[time=3389] You'll find great fulfillment in being a father.
[time=3395] Thirdly, not only is it a great, great role to be a mother, but it is great to be a woman in the Church of God because God will use your talents and use your gifts.
[time=3405] He only requires a spirit of cooperation, a submissive heart.
[time=3410] You know, he requires that from each of us.
[time=3415] Submission is a hard word. We don't like it, so we often don't use it.
[time=3421] You know, the Bible says men, we are to submit ourselves.
[time=3427] You've been listening to their special music by our musicians and the message from the Word of God by our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3434] If, as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your walk with God, we'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you.
[time=3442] Will you pray with me?
[time=3444] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3451] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse my heart and to make it pure.
[time=3457] I ask you to come in today, and Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3463] We are always encouraged when we hear of decisions made, and we'd like to have you write to us if you've made a decision.
[time=3469] And when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
