[time=67] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=114] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=117] It's truly a joy on this Memorial Day weekend to welcome you to our Morning Worship Service.
[time=126] When there is a holiday like this, many of our people are traveling, but many of the people Black Hawk have friends and family visiting them and visiting us in our church service.
[time=136] We want to say a special word of welcome to you guests who are with us today.
[time=141] And also a word of greeting to our friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=146] We sincerely hope that in this hour that Jesus Christ is magnified and praised and that out of our hearts they'll spring forth like an ocean wave roaring forth a desire to worship and to please Him.
[time=160] In the Psalms, David wrote, "Lift up your head, O ye gates.
[time=166] And be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.
[time=172] Who is the King of glory, the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
[time=179] Who is the King of glory, the Lord almighty?
[time=182] He is the King of glory."
[time=196] He is the King, he is the King of glory, the Lord of glory.
[time=211] Who is the man healing the poor?
[time=221] Open your hearts and you will see.
[time=224] Who is the smanny's children adore?
[time=228] Jesus Christ, he is the King.
[time=232] Who is he calling the dead from the grave?
[time=235] And who is the one who wanted to pray?
[time=240] Lift up your head.
[time=241] He is the King of glory, the Lord God strong and mighty.
[time=248] Open your doors, you see the King, and he will pray.
[time=259] Who is the smanny who comes to cease?
[time=268] Open your hearts and you will see.
[time=272] Is he a prophet whom can he be?
[time=275] The Lord of policy is the King, he is the King of glory, the Lord God strong and mighty.
[time=286] Open your doors, you see the King, and he will pray.
[time=298] Who is he hanging on this cross?
[time=305] Who can conquer sin and death?
[time=313] Who is his breaking through the past?
[time=317] Open your hearts and you will see.
[time=322] Who is his King to creation us, the Lord of policy is the King, he is the King of glory, the Lord God strong and mighty.
[time=338] Open your doors, you see the King, and he will pray.
[time=350] He is the King of glory, he is the King of glory, the Lord of policy, the Lord of policy, the Lord of policy.
[time=369] He is the King of glory, he is the King of glory, he is the King of glory, he is the King of glory.
[time=391] King of glory, King of glory, he is the King of glory.
[time=406] Rejoice, rejoice, the Lord is King, let us continue on that theme, he is the King of glory, him number 190 will sing the first and fourth senses.
[time=420] The music was chosen today in such a way that it demands active participation, so I trust that you will join with your voices in your heart as we sing together these two stanzas.
[time=439] Come to the Lord is sing your Lord and bring your soul, rejoice in my sense, sing your love evermore, and love your heart, give your love more sing your soul, and say, "Ree, Lord, sing your love, sing your love evermore.".
[time=468] Rejoice, rejoice, the Lord will sing your soul, our Lord will touch the ground, and take me to the world's cup, and I will return our home, with the heart of our heart, with the Lord Lord, say, "Ree, Lord, sing your soul, I say, "Ree, Lord, sing your soul, I say, "Ree, Lord, sing your love evermore."
[time=496] Rejoice, thank you very much for your singing, we appreciate it, when you join in enthusiastically to these great hymns, let's listen now to the ladies' trios they come, be speaking about problems, Jesus walking with us throughout all of our problems, some of the circumstances that they mention in the song, perhaps you have not gone through, but in a congregation like this,
[time=525] certainly there are some that have had struggles even throughout this week, and we need to remember that Jesus is walking with us in those circumstances.
[time=555] But through deep water, I've bowed in the mire, I've fought in the battle with her angel God, but this is the reason I always go on.
[time=583] Jesus is with me my shepherd and guide, all that I need He is there to provide, and makes the difference, this friend by my side.
[time=612] Jesus is walking with me, with me, I've known disappointment, I've suffered some loss, I've felt on my shoulder the weight of a cross,
[time=641] I've cried in the darkness and wished for the light, but somehow His presence gave songs in the night.
[time=662] I've left on the mountain, I've savored success, rejoiced in my blessings in more than in less,
[time=682] I've tasted the good life while praising His name, but sunshine or shadow, it's always the same.
[time=701] Jesus is with me my shepherd and guide, all that I need He is there to provide,
[time=720] that makes the difference, this friend by my side.
[time=730] Jesus is walking with me, Jesus is walking with me.
[time=750] Jesus is walking with me.
[time=769] Again, I want to thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=774] Pete, I was with our Super Sixties ministry on Friday and was so encouraged to meet the number of those people who said they watched the television ministry each week.
[time=784] We had a really good group at Supers, it was pastors day, and it was good to meet some of the area pastors that whose people come to our Super Sixties program.
[time=792] You know, I enjoyed that a great deal meeting some new pastors to our community, but particularly meeting the senior adults who told us how much the Bible Hour means to them.
[time=802] We sit here with all the television equipment and crew, and hopefully it's reaching the hearts of people, and what a joy it is to meet them face to face.
[time=810] I don't think there's a greater encouragement, Rick, than to have people just stop you either in the shopping center or come and visit our church and say that we watch the Bible Hour regularly.
[time=821] Even some of the people that came last Sunday night for the celebration of praise, it was a delight to meet them, and we really appreciated the special effort.
[time=828] They often, the people in Ohio watch the program go to their church, and then come to special events at our church, and we're glad to meet them and see them.
[time=837] You know, many churches do not have a Sunday evening program, and we encourage you to look for a ministry of special opportunity on Sunday nights.
[time=846] And tonight we have one of those for you. This being Memorial Day weekend, we have an extra special program, and that is a traditional Sunday night film.
[time=855] And tonight's film is won by Dr. James Dobson called "Turning Your Heart Towards Home."
[time=862] I've never heard Dr. Dobson speak either in person or on tape or on film that it wasn't a special encouragement to my heart.
[time=870] We want to encourage you to join us tonight at 6 o'clock for Dr. Dobson on "Turning Your Heart Towards Home."
[time=878] The service will be at 6 o'clock, that's Indiana time for you friends across the border, and that service will be a time really dedicated exclusively to the Ministry of the Film by Dr. Dobson.
[time=889] We're located on State Street at 7321 East State Boulevard in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=896] Pete, the Panorama's coming up in the not-too-distant future.
[time=900] Yes, Rick, we just finished the program, but it seems like another one is coming up, and we're excited to announce the patriotic Panorama,
[time=907] which will be held this year on June 29th.
[time=910] That's the Sunday just before the 4th of July, and we're titling it this year, "America, We Are So Blessed."
[time=917] And we will have as our special guest, Stephen Maria Gardner and Bruce Hanks from Wisconsin, who is a distant relative of Abraham Lincoln,
[time=925] as well as our sanctuary choir doing special patriotic numbers that evening.
[time=929] Well, I saw some of the promotional pictures of Mr. Hanks, and he does a character study, character presentation of Abraham Lincoln.
[time=938] He is the exact age of Abraham Lincoln just after the Civil War, the exact height and size, he even has the mole on the right side of his cheek,
[time=947] and it is fascinating even to talk to him on the telephone.
[time=950] Boy, that is going to be something special.
[time=952] We want to encourage you to plan on spending the patriotic weekend of June 29th just prior to the 4th of July with us for the Panorama.
[time=962] And finally, today, before we go back to the Morning Worship Service, we want to encourage you to write for this excellent little booklet.
[time=969] Today's the last day we'll be offering it.
[time=972] It's entitled "Motherhood. It Helps If You Smile." Because May is the month that we celebrate Mother's Day, we thought this would be a particularly appropriate pamphlet to encourage you to write for.
[time=985] This booklet simply takes a healthy look through humor at the role not only of being a mother, but simply the role of being a part of a family.
[time=994] You might be a grandmother or grandfather and find this a great-looking back experience on the days of your child raising.
[time=1002] If you'd like a copy, simply write to us today, and we would be glad to send you one.
[time=1007] Let me encourage you to write for the booklet entitled "Motherhood" and write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1019] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1023] We do encourage you to write, and we hope that both the pamphlet and today's broadcast will strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus,
[time=1030] and to help you walk the victorious Christian life.
[time=1060] Thy greatness, your could, my thoughts, be vast enough to understand thy ways.
[time=1077] How could I, with mortal eyes, see through thy realm of wisdom?
[time=1089] Sweet mystery, 'tis all can be worthy to be praised.
[time=1107] The glory, how we adore thee, we cast our crowns before your throne of the words.
[time=1136] To praise you, our dear, to raise you higher than the end of love.
[time=1159] Lamb of glory, Messiah, great Jehovah, who can comprehend thy deity?
[time=1184] The raging hills, and silver waves who rise to praise you.
[time=1197] How excellent is thy Holy Samaritan's King?
[time=1214] Lamb of glory, how we adore thee, we cast our crowns before your throne.
[time=1242] Of the words, to praise you, my dear, to raise you higher.
[time=1262] Lamb of glory, Lamb of glory.
[time=1286] Our Father, today, we come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus, the Lamb of glory.
[time=1293] We thank you that you, Lord Jesus, were willing to become a lamb, a sacrifice for my sins, our sins,
[time=1304] the sins of the world. Father, today, we find ourselves both humbled and exalted.
[time=1312] We're humbled to think of your great love, and then when we think of it, we want to exalt and to shout and to magnify your name and to say that your Son Jesus is our Lamb of glory,
[time=1324] and we've come to worship you today, O God, our Maker and our Redeemer.
[time=1330] We have asked the question, "Who is the King of glory?" And we have found that He is the Lamb of glory, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1340] And as the gates of the world open up to give Him entrance, we, today, Father, open up the gates of our hearts to say, "Come in, Lord Jesus, live and reign and rule in me."
[time=1352] God, may that be the prayer of each heart here today.
[time=1355] May that one who has never received Christ today say, "Jesus, come in."
[time=1362] And may that heart who days or years ago asked Christ to come in, affirmed today the desire to
[time=1370] have Him reign as King of kings, the King of glory. Father, we want to thank you today for the
[time=1378] freedom that we have spiritually in Christ, and on this unique day of memorial to remember
[time=1386] the heritage that has been given to us in this land. We thank you for America, and we pray this
[time=1393] morning even as we sing, "God bless America." We know that every blessing comes from you.
[time=1400] Your Word has told us, and we ask your Spirit to affirm in us today, Father, that righteousness
[time=1407] exalts a nation, and sin is a reproach to any people. Father, we would pray for this country,
[time=1414] that there would be moral and spiritual revival. We would pray for this church that it might be here.
[time=1420] We thank you today for those men and women who, with foresight and forthrightness,
[time=1427] founded a nation that affords to us the liberty to worship you and the prosperity
[time=1434] that we have received because we worship you. Father, today, we thank you, and yet we hurt.
[time=1442] As we think of those men and women who've given of their time, their years, their health, and in many, many cases, their lives to secure the freedom of this
[time=1453] great land. And on this weekend of remembering, we do remember and ask your peace to guard their
[time=1461] hearts and the hearts of those families who have lost loved ones. We would pray today for peace,
[time=1468] that our hearts might know the freedom from fear, that the gospel of Jesus Christ might reach into
[time=1474] parts of the world like South Africa and Libya. And I ran that you might bring peace to those spots
[time=1483] that Jesus Christ might be forthrightly declared. We pray today that through your Word you would
[time=1490] speak to each of us in Jesus' name. Amen. If you have your Bible with you today, I want to encourage
[time=1499] you to open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Many of you are visiting Blackhawk today and we're so
[time=1506] thankful that while you're away from home and visiting family, the worshiping was a priority.
[time=1512] And we're particularly thankful that you've chosen to worship the Savior with us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1519] Our basic habit on Sunday mornings is to study the Scriptures. We do that by selecting a book,
[time=1526] we're studying 1 Corinthians, and simply moving verse by verse or chapter by chapter. We want to
[time=1532] know what God has said about the issues of life. And so this morning we're studying from chapter 11
[time=1538] of 1 Corinthians verses 3 through 16. I'm going to read for you today from the new international
[time=1545] version of the Bible. The King James Bible is what I often use and many of you will have it.
[time=1551] The new international simply allows us not only to hold in our hand the finest of biblical scholarship
[time=1557] but something that was translated within our own lifetime. Therefore we don't have all of the
[time=1564] verbs ending in ETH and words that we often have to run to Webster to understand. This passage has
[time=1572] a few of those words so I'll read it for you in a more modern translation.
[time=1576] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 3. Now I want you to realize that the head of every man
[time=1584] is Christ and the head of the woman is man and the head of Christ is God. Everyone who prays or
[time=1595] prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head and every woman who prays or prophesies with her
[time=1603] head uncovered dishonors her head. It is just as though her head were shaved. If a woman does not
[time=1612] cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair
[time=1620] cut or shaved off she should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head since he is
[time=1627] the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of man. For the man did not come from woman
[time=1634] but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman but woman for man. For this reason and because
[time=1643] of the angels the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. In the Lord however
[time=1652] woman is not independent of man nor is man independent of woman. For as woman came from man
[time=1660] so also man is born of woman but everything comes from God.
[time=1668] Judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
[time=1673] Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him
[time=1681] but that if a woman has long hair it is her glory. For long hair is given to her as a covering
[time=1690] if anyone wants to be contentions about this we have no other practice nor do the churches of God.
[time=1698] On this particular passage Paul was dealing with a problem that was very very significant to the Corinthians. That was the problem of should a woman wear a head covering when she came to the
[time=1710] corporate worship service or was that optional equipment. I had a lot of fun this week thinking
[time=1717] of different titles that I could give to this message. At first I thought we could title this hats off to the ladies you know I'll follow up to Mother's Day then I thought no that's being
[time=1728] conclusive before I've been developmental so I thought unveiling the issue of head coverings
[time=1735] I thought no that's kind of a play on words so I just thought what is this passage really trying
[time=1742] to say. What certainly does have something here to say about head coverings and we'll talk about that but I really want you to know this there's more here than hats and if all we do today is
[time=1754] decide whether to wear a hat or not wear a hat I really think we miss the biblical issue.
[time=1759] Let's take a moment and outline what we're going to try to do today. First I'd like us to
[time=1767] look at these verses and follow Paul's logic as thinking in his argument.
[time=1773] Then secondly I think we do have to address the primary text and that is should women be wearing
[time=1779] hats today and then what I feel is most importantly is really draw some applications rather than
[time=1785] decide what they should have done 2,000 years ago in a city that doesn't exist. What are we going to do today? What's real here for you and for me? Let's follow that batting order. First of all
[time=1798] Paul's arguments. Paul begins by arguing from custom the world in which he lived in the traditions
[time=1805] that those people upheld. When the Bible is talking about a head covering here it's really
[time=1811] talking about more than just a head covering. I have the utmost respect and want to do nothing to depreciate. Friends like the almish or the meninite and other groups who believe a woman
[time=1822] ought to wear a head covering and the ladies wear a nice little knit doily or a silk cap of some kind to signify that which is meaningful to them and that's fine and I respect them for their tradition.
[time=1833] That however was not their tradition of Corinth. The tradition of the Mediterranean and the ancient
[time=1840] world was that when a woman wore a veil it was a veil. This was a long piece of cloth that would
[time=1846] literally encompass the entire body. It would be wrapped around like a shaw and a cloak and part
[time=1852] of it would become a crossed and cover the face and then all the way up to the head and drape down in the back exposing only the eyes. When Paul's talking about whether you wear that head covering or you
[time=1864] don't wear that head covering it was a significant statement. You see in the ancient world two things
[time=1871] were absolutely foregone conclusions for the woman. One is that she wore a veil and two that she had
[time=1879] long hair. There were only a few exceptions to that rule. The first were those women who had been
[time=1887] if you will branded for their immorality. In some parts of the Mediterranean and greater
[time=1894] Roman world if a woman had been immoral one of the ways that they punitively dealt with that
[time=1902] was the stripper of her veil and to shave her head or cut her hair short and as she went through society
[time=1909] that was a public mark that says this woman is a woman of poor reputation.
[time=1915] A Roman historian by the name of Tacitus gives us this information in his writings called
[time=1923] Germania which is simply his description of Germany. He said this land is a very populous land and
[time=1929] given its size adultery is very uncommon. However if a woman is found guilty she is summarily punished
[time=1937] by her husband who begins by cutting her hair. So if you lived in the Mediterranean world
[time=1944] ladies you would probably be wearing a veil not probably for sure. One exception would be those
[time=1950] whose society is branded for their immorality. A second group of people who were also identified
[time=1957] because of their lack of veil and short hair were prostitutes. Corinth was a city that had a very
[time=1963] high hill on top of that was the temple of Aphrodite and as a part of their cultic worship prostitution
[time=1970] was a part of it and each night by torch lights the prostitutes would come down off that high hill into the city and you knew who they were because they wore no veil and they had short hair and it
[time=1981] was a way of saying we're available to do business tonight. There were a third group of people who
[time=1988] often wore their hair short and no veil of the feminine gender. They were as one commentator
[time=1996] puts it this way not only those who had been branded for scandalous offense but those who
[time=2002] wore it that way out of bravado which is simply a way of saying there were those women who were
[time=2008] part of the women's lib of that day who said I want to show society that I do not have anyone
[time=2015] in authority over me but me and that became the visualization of that. Well given that fact that
[time=2023] it was the tradition of the Mediterranean world to wear this veil head covering and the only ones
[time=2029] who did not were those who were being identified for their social malignity you can see why Paul
[time=2037] said wait a minute women when you go to the church of Corinth and you take off that head covering
[time=2043] the people of your community are going to say is this another temple of Aphrodite is that what Christians do they all get together and after all you know they talk about brotherly and sisterly
[time=2053] love you just never know they're greeting each other with a holy kiss I hear the women don't even wear their head coverings and that was the issue. So Paul's first argument is one of culture in that
[time=2065] culture a woman of any dignity wore it and he expected them to wear it. His second argument was
[time=2072] an argument from extreme in verses five and six he simply says this hey if you're going to go to
[time=2080] one step and you're going to drop the veil in the head covering well then why not just take it to the extreme and shave your head or cut your hair short. He argues you certainly wouldn't do that
[time=2091] then why start down a path identifying yourself to be this if that's not really what you want to
[time=2097] be identified at. He said don't identify a little bit with the wrong thing. Thirdly he argues from
[time=2105] creation in verses seven to nine. His basic argument follows two prepositions the first one is from
[time=2113] or of in the King James and the second is for. He argues that woman came out of our from man and
[time=2120] he's going back to Adam and Eve. God took a rib and he created out of that part of a man out of
[time=2128] a woman. Secondly he argues that man then was not only the recipient of a woman being made of him
[time=2138] but she was made for him that is that she was made to be his partner. Now you can take this out of
[time=2145] extremes and begin to develop moral chauvinism that the Bible is not there stating and in a moment he'll put that imbalance but what he is simply saying is that God chose to create in this order
[time=2156] men than women and now Paul says God did it that way to show us that by analogy in his church
[time=2163] he expects the men to supply leadership and the women to be cooperative with that.
[time=2169] Now it says here that man has made an image of God but woman in the glory of man.
[time=2175] Does that really mean? Well to be sure women are also created in the image of God. In Genesis
[time=2182] 1.26 God said let us make man in our image. 27 says so he made them in his image and likeness
[time=2189] both male and female. But Paul is not here trying to describe the woman's relationship to God but
[time=2196] the woman's relationship to the man and he simply says that the woman is the glory of the man.
[time=2201] What I really believe he is saying there is that as God looks at us and he says humanity
[time=2210] that's the very best of all that I possess. A man is to look at his wife and say that is the very
[time=2217] best thing that I have. I have nothing that is more precious than the woman that you've given me to
[time=2223] be my partner in life and men there's something intrinsic about us isn't there that we find the
[time=2230] greatest significance of our life in that partner that God has given us. Listen to how one man
[time=2236] described it in Psalm 31 verse 10 he says a wife of noble character who can find she is worth far
[time=2244] more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. She brings him
[time=2253] good not harm all the days of his life. You know I think the music today was just great. I love that
[time=2262] first song the ladies trio was great you're singing was great but you know what I really like the best that last song wasn't that the best. I'm sure it was you know why I know that some of your visiting
[time=2274] don't know why that was my wife. You see you know the one I'm saying here Paul simply saying that
[time=2281] ladies you are the pinnacle of creation as that little girl said last week I quoted her
[time=2289] God made man and said I can do better than that and he created Eve you are the pinnacle of creation and it's simply saying here that a woman is the greatest glory that a man will ever know that partner
[time=2302] and don't take this out of balance and say therefore since man was first that man has certain
[time=2309] priorities over no the Bible doesn't it's going to put it in balance in just a moment.
[time=2313] Then there's another argument the argument from angels and you can take a theological hitchhike across the world on this statement verse 10 says for this reason and because of angels the woman
[time=2325] had to ought to have a sign of authority. There's two extremes I'll give you both and I fit the latter.
[time=2332] The first extreme says this back in Genesis 6 it says that the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[time=2340] and interpretation is the sons of God are angels the daughters of men are humans and that these
[time=2347] angels saw these beautiful women and said wow and so these angels put on human bodies came to earth
[time=2354] had relationships with the women the women bore children who weren't human and weren't angels
[time=2360] they were kind of half and half and because they were half and half they were giants the nephaeim
[time=2366] in the land in the days of Noah then the flood comes kills everybody all the humans in these nephaeim these half giants half human half angels and because they were half angels they didn't die
[time=2377] and their souls became demons. Now that sounds a bit eccentric but it does all fit together and
[time=2384] there are sound Bible scholars that say that's the origin of demons and then when they come to this passage they say there are angels and the angels really get aroused when they see the women in the
[time=2396] church without their veils on and so for the sake of angels you ought to wear head coverings.
[time=2402] Now I perhaps said that a little bit more facetiously than I mean it because that that is as some
[time=2408] people and I mean scholarly people would hold to. I really think that the sons of men were the Christians and the sons of God were the Christians and the sons of men were the non-Christians and
[time=2419] the two got married and that didn't please the Lord and I think angels probably are angels and
[time=2425] and stay angels and that's about it. Heavy theology there wasn't it but what does it mean here then
[time=2433] because of angels? Let me explain. If you'll remember in Isaiah 6 God sends an image of vision
[time=2442] to Isaiah and what's he sees? He sees an angel called a seraphim and what does he say? He says holy holy holy is the Lord. That angel was representing the fact that as a seraphim his job was the
[time=2455] guard the glory and the worship of God and I really believe the Bible is here simply saying that our
[time=2461] worship is conducted not only with the several hundred of us here but that angels are a part of
[time=2467] that and that whenever we perform out of character angels observe that as much as we do and we have
[time=2474] a responsibility to order our lives properly even when we don't think anyone's looking because someone
[time=2480] always is. The next argument he gives I think is critical that we take time with it I called
[time=2488] an argument in balance because he has argued so far talking about the order in the church but now
[time=2496] it's important that we put that in balance and he says in verse 11 in the Lord however woman is not independent of man nor is the man independent of the woman for as woman came from man
[time=2510] so also man is born of woman. Now what he's really saying is men is yes that is how I chose to order
[time=2517] my creation and yes that's the order I want my church but men don't ever forget that other than
[time=2523] Adam every one of you came from a woman and that there is mutual dependence between the sexes
[time=2532] and there is not a superior gender nor is there a gender that God favors but before the Lord we
[time=2539] are mutually dependent on each other and upon him. He didn't want them to take some extremist view
[time=2545] out of this passage then sixthly he argues from nature this has been an interesting passage over
[time=2552] the years. Verse 13 begins with a interrogative question he says judge for yourselves
[time=2559] and then he asks a couple of questions judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray with
[time=2567] her head uncovered and he was basically simply saying this now 99% of the women of our culture
[time=2574] pray with their head covered the other percent are prostitutes does it make sense to you to pray
[time=2580] with your head uncovered he's really just you know arguing from natural what we might call if we were
[time=2586] a little more rural just some good old horse sense you don't have to be a genius to figure that one out and then he takes off on another statement he says and does not the very nature of things
[time=2599] teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him but that if a woman has short hair
[time=2605] it is her glory there have been more mountains plowed out of this mole hill than any other passage
[time=2614] of scripture that I know of in the last 10 years let me tell you first of all what this passage is
[time=2620] not saying it's not saying that it is unnatural for a woman to have short hair or that it is unnatural
[time=2629] for men to have long hair genetics and chemistry and biology are not what he means by nature here
[time=2637] he's simply talking about the natural way we do things let me give you some illustration
[time=2644] when you get out in the car and you leave the parking lot and you run over three pedestrians and honk at everybody who turned in front of you you probably just will kind of naturally drive on the
[time=2655] right hand side of the street that's just kind of natural that's how we do it in America be careful when you cross the streets in Japan look the wrong way before you cross
[time=2666] another thing that's kind of natural here is when you get up in the morning you put on shoes and
[time=2672] you wear shoes here around the house you wore shoes and when you came in the church you kept your shoes on in Japan when you get up in the morning you put on slippers when you leave you put on shoes when you go on to someone else's house you take off your shoes and you put on slippers when you leave you put your shoes back on when you go to church you take your shoes off and you put on your slippers again to them that's perfectly natural why we were there we said why
[time=2696] do you wear slippers and not shoes in your house and they went because we're a civilized nation
[time=2705] oh that says a lot about America to them wearing slippers in the house was just natural they never
[time=2714] questioned that that's just the way you do things doesn't every civilized person do that well i'd like to think i'm civilized that's been up for a debate i realize but it's natural to them it's natural to us to keep our shoes on paul simply saying it's kind of the natural way we do things isn't it the women have long hair the men have short hair
[time=2735] i remember coming to black hawk as a youth pastor and and at age 24 i look like i was
[time=2741] soon to graduate from high school the day i got married i got a haircut and the lady said i know what you're doing tonight i said what and she said you're going to the prom and i it was about the finished graduate school i have to give this guy the benefit of the doubt but i
[time=2756] showed up i'm the youth pastor from black hawk Baptist church we're on a junior high retreat seven of the guys are taller than i am and i've got curly hair and this preacher takes off
[time=2767] man he was having a great time with this passage and he was talking about how nature declares that men's hair must be short and women's hair must be long and he got down to wear women if your hair wasn't at least this long and men if your hair wasn't at least this short you were identifying
[time=2783] with the homosexuality that's destroying this country and you're against nature and god and i mean he went long and hard that was good stuff didn't have anything to do with the bible but i mean he was going at it and you know i thought you know what are we doing here you know what we're doing
[time=2800] we're taking the bible we're saying this is my lever this is my lever that if you don't look the
[time=2806] way i want you to look then i'll just take it and i'll whack you with my lever and i'll pry you to where i want you to be this passage doesn't teach any of that it just simply says paul was saying
[time=2816] most of the men have short hair most of the women have long hair it's kind of the natural way we do
[time=2824] things and you know we get so hung up on all of that and it was simply culture if you don't believe
[time=2831] it was culture those Roman soldiers wear skirts and if you're around any of them don't call me sissy
[time=2840] the whole point is that's the way they naturally did things his sixth argument is its natural his
[time=2848] seventh is tradition verse 16 he says if anyone wants to be contentious anybody wants to fight
[time=2854] about it this is paul's final statement he says we don't have any other practice nor do any of the
[time=2860] churches paul was saying this is unprecedented for a christian woman to come and to take off her
[time=2867] head covering that's unprecedented now the real question we've got to answer then our head coverings
[time=2875] for today or were they for corn my feeling is they were a cultural expression
[time=2883] of an eternal principle let me give you some illustrations i don't know anywhere in the bible
[time=2892] where it says don't drive over 55 miles an hour thus say at the lord i've read the whole book and
[time=2899] i don't ever remember reading that but that is a cultural application of a biblical principle that
[time=2909] says obey government i don't know anywhere in the bible that says thou shall go to church every
[time=2916] sunday night at six o'clock i hope you do but that's simply an application of the biblical principle
[time=2925] that says not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together you see there are principles and then
[time=2932] there are applications of those principles we wear a ring what does that symbol that doesn't make me
[time=2941] married if i take this ring off come off i'm still there i'm still married that's just a
[time=2948] cultural symbol that i'm married it has nothing to do with whether i'm married or not
[time=2954] that veil was their cultural symbol of a woman saying i am a woman in my society and i will function
[time=2962] as a woman i will not function as a man now let me give you several reasons why i believe this is
[time=2970] cultural first of all there are several passages in the bible that speak about the appropriate clothing for women and other than this passage which isn't about clothing none of them mention
[time=2982] the veil or the head covering i'm thinking particularly of first timothy two and first peter three which get into a little bit of detail work and it's never mentioned secondly here if the veil is the
[time=2993] issue then it's got to be a veil and i'm not trying to slight brothers and sisters who believe
[time=3001] differently but if you're going to this past and you're saying this passage says that i've got to wear the head covering then it needs to be the full head covering with just the slits for the eyes i mean if it's if we're gonna take it literally then we got to take it literally thirdly the emphasis in this passage and throughout the bible is on the principle not the
[time=3021] application the principle is that men are to be responsible to lead men if you're not serving
[time=3028] and leading in this church and community you fail to live up to your biblical responsibilities and ladies if you're not cooperative with that leadership you're failing to live up to yours
[time=3039] fourthly if the veil is required literally okay if we're going to come and it's called hermeneutics
[time=3047] if we're going to apply the principle it says you've got to take it literally right here that's fine but then you've got to do that consistently and when you come to first peter chapter three it says this first three ladies let your beauty be out inwardly not outwardly the
[time=3065] adornment such as braiding hair all right if you're going to literally say you've got to wear a veil
[time=3071] then you've got to say and you can't braid your hair or the wearing of gold no jewelry because
[time=3080] you're going to take this passage literally then you got to take peter literally and then king james says or the putting on of apparel and if you take that literally we got some serious problems now i'm i'm for saying the head covering is optional but the rest of the clothing that's not
[time=3097] the whole point is this if you're saying the veil is literal then every other these things have to
[time=3103] be prohibitive too or else they have to be culturally understood finally it's this point
[time=3110] pulse point is to be modest and culturally appropriate in their culture you wore a head covering
[time=3117] everybody did except for three groups of people that you don't want to be a part of
[time=3124] and it was a sign to all society of what you meant when you did that
[time=3130] in our today world wearing of a head covering does not say anything it doesn't make a statement
[time=3138] anymore now that may be good or it may be bad but it is that when you wear a hat people don't know
[time=3144] whether you got a new hat from other's day or whether you have a sunburn or whether hats are
[time=3150] coming back in style but nobody says isn't that gracious she just wants everyone to know where
[time=3156] she stands spiritually it doesn't communicate and paul's whole point is to be culturally appropriate
[time=3164] so in my conclusion the the head covering is totally optional and my heart is well pleased
[time=3173] with those people who believe that they should do something and they symbolize that that's their choice I think we ought to honor them and respect them but I don't feel like we have to conform to that now my real heart's desire is to say this to you there's more here than hats if all we do
[time=3190] today is decide whether the lady should wear hats or not then next Sunday will spend it on how big the feather should be that that's not the point I think there are three key issues here that I'd
[time=3201] like us to draw to the text issue number one is I think more than anything else this passage is
[time=3207] saying let men be men and let women be women in the 70s started a movement that's still going
[time=3214] but much quieter today called a unisex movement that says let's deal away with everything that's female and everything that's male and let's blend the sexes why don't want to be misunderstood that if a lady does a job and a man does the same job I think that I have the same status and they ought to have the same benefits and they ought to have the same pay and they ought to have the same recognition but I don't believe men ought to be women and women ought to be men I believe God is made us unique and we had a function uniquely that's why Paul says men don't dress like a woman don't cover your head women don't uncover your head and act like a man and their culture that was the issue a second application is this modesty and godliness are never out of style with God
[time=3256] they're never out of style third application is this a Christian should be a rare
[time=3263] blend with society you know what Paul was saying is he was saying as Christians don't do something
[time=3272] that's idiosyncratic that's a sophisticated way of saying don't be weird if everybody's wearing a
[time=3279] veil wear a veil and throughout the history of Christianity we have majored on the miners
[time=3286] to wear a Christian today is a caricature of what God really meant a Christian to be there are things that we do not conform to those are issues but if it's not a biblical issue
[time=3299] then the best thing to do is just to do what everybody else does you know if they're wearing wingtips at the office wear wingtips if they're not wearing wingtips put them up in the closet
[time=3309] in ten years they'll be wearing them again but don't wear them in between you know Christianity ought to be something that people see as being different in our life
[time=3320] not seeing us as being different Christianity is not a matter of style it's a matter of character
[time=3328] and if it's not a principle of character then we ought to do what the rest of society is doing
[time=3335] they won't know we're Christians because our skirts are longer our hair is shorter are we wear less makeup or more or something else let me give you three principles very very quick first thing you need to do if if you're being frustrated by the change in styles is issue number
[time=3354] one is decide this is it an issue or is it an irritation you know some of the things that our
[time=3361] kids will want to wear will make an issue out when the truth of it is it's just an irritation men do you remember those ties we used to wear that look more like the tablecloth somebody showed up today we'd make an issue out of that it's not an issue it may be an irritation
[time=3378] two remember your age five years ago nothing bothered me
[time=3387] i'm getting more picky i'm getting more irritable it happened to me for the first time it was like a near-death experience i was talking to a teenager and she said how old are you and i muttered 33 and she said
[time=3405] see you wouldn't know anything anyway well i remember knowing the art doesn't that count
[time=3412] i have to admit i'm 33 and what i could tolerate at 28 is hard on this old man
[time=3418] and i think some of you we've been sharing with you the special music from our musical guests and then the message from
[time=3432] our pastor Rick Hawks if as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your
