[time=205] This Sunday is graduation Sunday, not only for our own school, Black-Off Christian School, but it's the time of year that most of the community schools are celebrating their graduations,
[time=216] a time for us to at least say a word of recognition to our graduates, a time when, for the first
[time=222] time in a long time, the weather says it's summer, and we're glad on this summer like morning you've come that we can worship the Lord together.
[time=230] We also want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=234] What a joy it is to meet many people who aren't able to physically be a part of this church, but through television have come to know Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=243] We've come today to worship Him, to lift up our voices and our hearts in praise.
[time=248] How excellent is Thy name, O Lord.
[time=253] Let heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is Thy name.
[time=257] I hope that in your heart today there's a desire to praise God for His love, for His care.
[time=264] Our choir is now going to sing a medley of songs that speak about the fact that God cares
[time=270] and that He cares for you.
[time=283] [MUSIC]
[time=298] God will take care of you through every day or all the way.
[time=317] He will take care of you.
[time=336] The eyes of God are on me.
[time=345] He sees everything I do.
[time=355] His arms are strong around me.
[time=364] They keep me safe and secure.
[time=374] And He knows where I am, every hour of every day.
[time=384] He knows His God I think.
[time=388] He knows His words that I might say.
[time=393] And of all living times I've stepped out of His will.
[time=402] I've never been out of His care.
[time=413] God will take care of you through every day or all the way.
[time=431] He will take care of you.
[time=448] And He knows where I am, every hour of every day.

[time=462] He knows His words that I might say.
[time=467] And of all living times I've stepped out of His will.
[time=476] I've never heard of all I've never been out of His care.
[time=506] Take my life, Lord, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee.
[time=520] We're going to continue our music scene, hymn number 611, verses 1, 5, and 6 of hymn number 611.

[time=597] And I need this treasure soon.

[time=623] Well, you continue your active participation in our service as you listen to the ministry of music from Rick Hall's.
[time=630] Rick is going to come and sing a song entitled, "He Touched Me."
[time=636] I was shackled by a heavy bird head.
[time=664] Me, the Lord of guilt and shame.
[time=675] Then the hand of Jesus touched me.
[time=686] And now I am no longer the same.
[time=697] He touched me, the Lord of guilt and shame.
[time=713] This was my soul, something, something happened.
[time=724] Now I know he touched me.
[time=735] He touched me, the Lord of guilt and shame.
[time=758] Since I met this blessed Savior.
[time=769] Since he cleansed and made me whole.
[time=780] I will never cease to praise him.
[time=791] He touched me, the Lord of guilt and shame.
[time=817] This was my soul, something, something happened.
[time=828] Now I know he touched me.
[time=838] He touched me, the Lord of guilt and shame.
[time=867] Hello and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=872] My name is Rick Hawks and it's my privilege to be the pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=880] I'd like to say hello to you. I'm Peter Kobe and I'm the minister of music at Black Hawk Baptist Church. Good morning, Rick.
[time=886] Hello and hello to you. This is our first opportunity to be on channel 68 and we hope by this broadcast we make acquaintance with many, many new friends.
[time=896] Today we're bringing to you a special edition of the Bible Hour but first allow me to explain to you what our ministry is.
[time=903] The Bible Hour is a weekly broadcast of the morning worship services of the Black Hawk Baptist Church from which we bring to you our choir special music and the morning message.
[time=913] But we had a special guest with us a number of months ago who challenged the hearts of our people and our regular television audience in such a tremendous way we wanted to share that broadcast.
[time=925] With each of you. The man who spoke that day is Bruce Wilkinson. Bruce is the president of a ministry called Walk Through the Bible Ministries.
[time=935] And today we would like to tell you about two particular ministries of Walk Through the Bible that you can share in.
[time=942] The first is Timeless Insights. Rick we've been offering to our listeners Timeless Insights for a number of months now.
[time=949] We'd like to explain to you that it's a monthly publication going through the entire New Testament in one year.
[time=955] If you'd like to receive a copy of Timeless Insights we are studying the book of John right now.
[time=960] Also there are some biographies from A.W. Tozer. And receiving a book like this is simply by writing.
[time=968] You could write to the Bible Hour today. The address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=979] You know Pete quite often I'm Astrum people how they can get something out of God's word on their own that they struggle to make a personal quiet time meaningful and they're not always sure they understand what they've read.
[time=991] And that's why we encourage you to write to us for Timeless Insights. As Pete mentioned it's a Bible study tool that will systematically lead you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1001] Giving you a passage to read and then an explanation from a great man of God who has poured his life into studying the scriptures.
[time=1009] Again our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. If you'll simply write to us please tell us two things.
[time=1023] First of all that you would like a copy of Timeless Insights and that secondly you saw this program on Channel 68.
[time=1030] Earlier I mentioned there are two ministries we wanted to share with you.
[time=1034] The second is called a Walk Through the Bible Seminar. Pete you've been to a seminar of this nature. What was that like?
[time=1041] Well it was very interesting Rick this happened to be a man named John White who took us through the entire Old Testament by visually presenting the book.
[time=1050] It's not unusual for them to have a wide area for the platform and then they specify certain areas geographically
[time=1058] and then there are some visual hand motions and we begin with the book of Genesis and go through the entire Old Testament by recognizing visual signs that the leader will put up and that will give us perhaps the order of the kings of the Old Testament.
[time=1074] Some of the significant events that took place in Exodus and in the Chronicles and in Kings and it's very exciting and it amazes me how fast you can learn the major events and the chronology of the Old Testament.
[time=1088] It's a most exciting time for everyone. I'm really looking forward to that. Most of us have a great deal of difficulty putting biblical events of the Old Testament into a logical order.
[time=1099] What's the relationship between Hosea and Hezekiah or Isaiah and Joshua?
[time=1104] Sometimes we become intimidated by the Old Testament because it's longer than the New Testament. The names are a little stranger and it's very easy than just a back away.
[time=1114] Well we're having a seminar here on January the 30th Friday night and January the 31st Saturday morning with Walk Through the Bible Ministries on a Walk Through the Old Testament.
[time=1128] And you'll be able to come to this seminar on Friday and Saturday and have the Old Testament explain to you put together in a humorous and exciting way so that after you leave that seminar you'll be able to put the Old Testament together in your mind.
[time=1143] It's interesting to me to note they tell you not to take any notes they'll give you the notes at the end of it. We hope that you can be a part of the Walk Through the Bible Seminar.
[time=1152] If you would like to simply write to us at the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the Register for Walk Through the Bible Seminar.
[time=1163] Now we go to our worship service and you'll be hearing from the President of Walk Through the Bible Ministries, Bruce Wilkinson.
[time=1173] We need wisdom, we need power and true love for each other we have had so many big but empty words.
[time=1202] As we come before your face asking for your grace bring your people to a state of kingdom.
[time=1217] We store your church again, touch your people once again.
[time=1230] With your precious holy hand we pray let your kingdom shine upon this earth.
[time=1244] Through our living glorious church not for temporary days but to restore authority and power.
[time=1265] Let a mighty rushing wind blow and touch your people once again.
[time=1284] Lord you see your tired servant the broken wounded soldier oh how much we need your precious healing hand.
[time=1298] We need the power of the cross as the only source for us.
[time=1311] We store your church again, touch your people once again.
[time=1323] With your precious holy hand we pray let your kingdom shine upon this earth.
[time=1337] Through our living glorious church not for temporary days but to restore authority and power.
[time=1357] Let a mighty rushing wind blow and touch your people once again.
[time=1404] Thank you Susan the ministry of a song that would say that God loves us and that his spirit is able to touch us and to bring to damaged emotions.
[time=1417] We can spiritual lives a refreshment a new touch a second wind.
[time=1425] This morning is our privilege to introduce to you some of the graduates I'd like to take just a moment to read you the list of graduating seniors both from high school and college from our church.
[time=1437] In the last hour is when the Sunday school class of the high school and the college class were both here so it's very likely that the most one or two of these people are here but at least allow me to honor them by the reading of their name in this service.
[time=1451] The following people have graduated from high school Pamela Craig Charles Kramer Paul Davis Stefan Eckert Andrea Emmerlin John Faber Don Glock Sean Griffith or excuse me Shannon Griffith
[time=1468] John Hicks John Kelsey Judy Kirschner Tracy Lewis Kimberly Marsh Kristi Medert Emilio Molinar Mark Nussbaum Montague Padilla Andy Rang Kim Renshaw Greg Rhodes Amy Russell Thomas Smith Diane Stevens Janet Sustorf Robert Taylor Brett
[time=1494] Vanetta Tim Walter Julie Wigan Kim Wilson Tim Wilson and Mark Zulman and then graduates from college are Marcia Guthrie Ken Hooker Lisa Kobe Kimberly Muncie Tim Nussbaum Scott Schindler Alan Schneider Nancy Treen Joanne Ward Lisa Yovan and Brad Ball
[time=1522] Through all of those people go a great word of congratulations from us to them for completing the task that's before them and the joy is that most of these young people have had a not only an experience of academics but while going through high school and college
[time=1538] they've had an experience of serving Christ on their campuses and in their school and we're certainly proud of them for serving the Lord in those areas of influence the church has a gift for each of them that they can pick up in the lobby but we wanted to recognize them by name in this service
[time=1555] We've asked Mr. Bruce Wilkinson to come and to challenge us with God's word while he spoke in the first service I was teaching one of the Sunday school classes and trying to make my way from that class through the hallway was an experience that I usually don't have
[time=1570] Now I know what you go through trying to make it from there to here there were no fatalities were proud to report this morning by getting through the hallway was a challenge but as I came through so many of the people from the first service told me how much they appreciated the ministry today
[time=1587] As a matter of fact I wasn't out of the Sunday school room before a lady said can I get a tape of this morning's message and I assured her she certainly could then when the college guys told me that the message of this morning was one of the best he ever heard me give
[time=1601] I think that was a hint but today we have as our guest speaker Bruce Wilkinson
[time=1607] Bruce has supplied a great ministry to our church for a number of years he is the founder and the president of a ministry called Walk Through the Bible Ministries
[time=1617] and they supply pamphlets and literature like our daily walk and timeless insights booklets that we make available here at church and through the Bible hour
[time=1628] Is a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary a firm student of God's Word and in a time of just informally talking yesterday
[time=1636] Bruce I think I learned more from you over three diet Pepsi's than I did in seminary We're delighted that you're here. Thank you for investing your life in God's Word and in us here at Blackhawk
[time=1647] Thank you Well good morning It's a pleasure to be with you and to share on this special Sunday morning And the subject I'd like to talk to you about is gone to answer the question which of those three chairs on my right do you sit in?
[time=1663] Before you leave you'll know where your grandparents sit where you sit and perhaps even if you're old enough where your children sit
[time=1672] Those three generations Sermonit takes place in Joshua chapter 24 so if you have your Bibles with me turn it into Joshua chapter 24
[time=1683] This idea started quite a few years ago as I was at a banquet in the east coast
[time=1689] And a little bit into the banquet I discovered that somebody that I had heard of all my life a major Christian leader in our country's son was attending the banquet
[time=1700] And at an appropriate moment when we were at a break time I found my way over to his table and began to talk to him and I said to him
[time=1708] What was it like growing up in your father's home?
[time=1711] I was expecting some great insight Man stood up and said I hate my father. I don't believe the Bible He began to curse curse the name of Jesus Christ and walked right out the room
[time=1725] I'll ever forget thinking to myself how on earth could that have happened
[time=1733] I was depressed for a couple of weeks trying to put together what I knew about this man and his child his young man
[time=1740] Who's old enough to have children?
[time=1742] And so I want to talk to you about the question how do some godly parents have rebellious children
[time=1750] And I in a sense feel like we take the side of the rug in our church We talk about this and we sweep it underneath the corner and we put back the rug and we place our piano
[time=1762] On top of that pile and we never admit we have a mess in the corner And so therefore this morning I want to talk about How come that happens So much of the time First of all take a look at Joshua chapter 24 and see if we can't find where the first person on these three chairs sits
[time=1783] It takes place in Joshua 24 verse 14 Joshua's about ready to die and he says now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth
[time=1795] And put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the river and in Egypt serve the Lord
[time=1802] And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord Then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve Whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the river Or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house We will serve the Lord That's the first chair, that's the chair of Joshua A man who says but as far as I'm concerned I'm going to serve the Lord Now take a look at verse number 31 and see if we can't find the second generation Joshua 24 31 says Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua
[time=1842] That would be the first generation and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua
[time=1848] Who had known all the works of the Lord which he had done for Israel. That's the second one
[time=1854] The generation who arose after Joshua Now what happened to the third generation that generation who arose right after The second generation died Take a look at Judges chapter 2 for a moment and we'll get our last passage down
[time=1872] It kind of reviews in Judges chapter 2 verse 7 So the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua That's generation 1 And all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord which he had done for Israel
[time=1888] That's generation 2 And chapter 2 verse 10 says when all that generation had been gathered to their fathers That mean they died Another generation, generation 3 arose after them Notice the two characteristics here Who did not know the Lord Number 2 Nor the work which he had done for Israel Take a look over here to these three chairs and come with me as we try to place Joshua on these three chairs
[time=1919] This would be where Joshua sat The generation who outlived Joshua And then they had children There arose another generation after them And I think if you were to put a word on the back of this chair It would be the word commitment It would be the word that describes Joshua having a whole heart and being sold out to God
[time=1942] Did he know God?
[time=1944] Yes Did he have mighty works?
[time=1947] Yes And then that generation The contemporaries of Joshua grew up And the Bible says something very interesting about them It says they knew the Lord But it doesn't say they had the works It says they knew about the works See this is a generation where the sun and the moon stood still This is a generation that had the walls of Jericho fall down This is a generation that saw the Jordan River dry up and they walk through on dry land This is the generation whose prayers had been answered Then they had children They grew up in a godly home And therefore the text says that second generation knew the Lord And knew about the works that he had done It doesn't say that they had the works It says they knew about what God did for their parents A Christian?
[time=2007] Yes Sold out?
[time=2010] No But they grew up in a sold out home When this generation grew up They knew the Lord and knew about the works They had children There arose another generation but listened to what the text says in Judges chapter 2 There arose another generation after them, number one Who knew not the Lord They grew up in a Christian home but they weren't saved But even more tragically and surprisingly was a next comment This text says they didn't even know the works which God had done for Israel
[time=2046] That means the grandchildren of Joshua Didn't even know about the sun standing still or the moon standing still Didn't know about Jericho Saved?
[time=2059] Yes Saved?
[time=2063] No Had the works Saw the works Never heard about the works Why not?
[time=2076] Because this generation who knew about all those stories Didn't want to tell those stories to this generation because they had no stories It's like the sun saying to the dad Dad, thanks for telling me about granddad But what about you dad?
[time=2090] And dad having to say Well, it's not the same anymore Commitment Second generation would be the word compromise Born again, yes, but sold out, no And when you grow up in a compromising home You kind of have one leg on this side And one leg on this side And sometimes it's for God And sometimes it's for yourself And when you grow up in a home who's born again But not sold out Your child doesn't want your God And your child's life is filled with conflict
[time=2134] Conflict because the foundation he stands on is not strong It's not consistent This is the young person that says I just got to find myself Why?
[time=2147] Because he can't He doesn't know where to go for it And you can take most of the families of scripture And place them right in those three chairs Take for instance Abraham First chair, second chair, third chair Where would you put him?
[time=2164] First chair Did that mean he didn't sin?
[time=2168] Of course he sinned But he was a man who was sold out to God Second chair, his son Isaac And the difference between the first chair And the second chair isn't a glaring difference It's kind of a subtle difference You see, when Abraham went places The text says that When he got to a new place He gathered some rocks together And he built himself an altar And then the Bible says And he proclaimed the name of the Lord Which means in Hebrew He actually preached forth A sermon that the people around him About God He witnessed The second thing he did is he Duggled well Because they didn't have running water back then And the deserts of you didn't have water You didn't live long When you watch Isaac The difference isn't large But boy does it scream a message When Isaac got to a new place And there was no water His head turdsman came over to him and said Isaac, we don't have any more water We need to dig a well Well, we should kind of build an altar like my dad did Isaac, man, I'm dying of thirst Well, you're right God would understand, I'm sure And when you watch Isaac He's born again But he digs a well first Sometimes he builds an altar And when you grow up in a home That for God first and self second God's going to be in your picture Because you like what you saw There's integrity here Integrity means integral It means one That means what you appear to be Is what you are What you are in churches What you are at home Is what you are on the job Is what you are on the vacation You are the same This is integrity And integrity, ladies and gentlemen Attracts everyone And that young person Is attracted to that integrity It's wholesome, it's believable And it's attractive And therefore they bring God into their lives That's why this generation Becomes Christians at a young age If you grew up in a godly home 85% of you became a Christian Before you were 11 Why? It's because of your parents You saw it, you lived in it And it fit together There wasn't any pieces of the puzzle missing In your parents life But then when you became a Christian It's compromise Hey, God would understand I got to build this well The rest I'm going to die Abraham, I'm not going to die I'm going to proclaim the name of the Lord Then I'm going to take care of my food First God then self First self sometimes God And when you grew up in a home that has Self followed by God You let loose of God And you're just filled with self And I think the word here is conflict, isn't it?
[time=2357] And so when you watch Isaac You watch him compromise And when you watch Isaac's son Jacob Instead of compromise you have conflict All he wants is for himself He even lies to his father He lies to his uncle And he tries to lie and to rob God himself You're filled with conflict in here But where would you sit On those three chairs?
[time=2383] If you grew up a godly home Are you more godly than your parents?
[time=2390] Or is your godliness a lot more shallow?
[time=2396] Ladies and gentlemen, if you sit in the second chair What does that say to your children?
[time=2403] We'll take another family for a moment Where would you place David in here?
[time=2409] Right here Does the first chair person sin?
[time=2413] Yes, everybody sins I guess if you put another word on the back of this chair You can put the word people here See, a first generation Christian is sold out to people That doesn't mean they're an extrovert or an introvert Or not goal oriented, it means that they recognize That the only thing that's important to God and to themselves therefore Is people People first, you second Others first, you second Become a believer People is important to you when you're in the second chair But it's not as important as it is in the first chair In fact, the second chair Christian turns out to use people to reach their goals
[time=2464] Not openly, not even sometimes consciously But if this was people, this becomes possessions Things, money, success, accomplishment, achievement
[time=2479] Rising the corporate ladder, buying a bigger house And that's why when David passed on his reign He passed it on the Sullivan who started his reign with a heart for God But then as he grew up, he didn't make the transition over to here Like he could have made, but his heart followed after What the second generation Christian's heart always follows
[time=2506] And I'll show you that right out of the words of Jesus when we're done today This chair is always concerned with possessions and power
[time=2519] This one lives for their job This one lives to get ahead This one thinks the most important thing in life is achievement
[time=2530] That's how you dress This one usually drives a newer and better car than this one Usually wears a better suit than that one And usually carries a newer Bible than that one
[time=2546] There he is, David and Solomon, and when you grow up in the home of Solomon
[time=2552] Whereby you speak the words and you even believe the words but your life
[time=2560] Screams an opposite message by what you do Then there is that frustration and there is that conflict And so when Solomon passed on the scene and his young son came on Rayabone to take over this kingdom It ripped apart in his very hands You remember what happened with David?
[time=2581] He inherited a physical kingdom, he made it to be a spiritual kingdom Then Solomon took over a spiritual kingdom and turned it back into Tragically a physical kingdom And when the physical kingdom was turned on here, he lost the kingdom Why? He did not know how to think like God and he didn't even have the wisdom Of a wise man Why? He couldn't make up his mind All he could think about was self and so the whole nation split under his leadership
[time=2610] You see, ladies and gentlemen, every one of us sits in one of these three seats, don't we?
[time=2618] We're either committed to God Or we're committed to God and ourselves Or we're committed to ourselves Another one to picture this in your own mind is this one takes as its basis of how to live the Bible
[time=2636] And the Bible says Don't steal, this one doesn't steal Don't commit adultery, this one doesn't Be holy as I'm holy, it's an absolute It nails down something that doesn't move No matter what happens in society, that's still the Bible And that's still what I'm going to believe Well, the second generation believes the Bible but doesn't live underneath the Bible
[time=2666] The morality and lifestyles built by the Bible here, do you know what shapes our lives in this one?
[time=2673] Fellow Christians, believers, we kind of look and see what other people are doing around us
[time=2681] And we kind of let it move us along And we find ourselves saying things like, "I didn't used to do that, but it's not that bad"
[time=2694] We just completed a survey in Atlanta of some of the best churches, churches like this church perhaps
[time=2701] Best ones we could find, there are some fine churches in the city of Atlanta And we surveyed their high school young people, and we asked them about 40 questions And one of the questions we asked them was, "Have you and do you watch our rated movies?"
[time=2717] Over 75% of them said yes That means ladies and gentlemen, our young people on a national basis are watching nudity, adultery, rape, murder, violence, homosexuality
[time=2742] Some of the material that you may watch on television on some of the more popular shows on today's TV
[time=2751] Had you walked in on that 10 years ago, you would have blushed, you'd have been so embarrassed
[time=2759] And now you watch it Ladies and gentlemen, the first generation person doesn't watch it So before long, what begins to take place is the first generation's lifestyle begins to look further and further removed from what you do
[time=2776] If you happen to be sitting here, you begin to say, "Man, is that so radical?"
[time=2784] That's so far away from how I live, but the question is gang, who moved?
[time=2793] See, this one takes its basis of life, the Bible, it doesn't change, it says don't watch that stuff on television
[time=2803] This one? Hey, I'm a modern Christian, it doesn't have to impact me
[time=2810] Are you kidding me?
[time=2816] And when you grew up in a Christian home who watched the junk on television But then goes to church and acts as if you are a holy person because this person looks like this person
[time=2827] They don't have different clothes or different vocabulary or carry a different Bible, they look the same
[time=2834] When you go up in a home like that, pretty soon the only thing that shapes your value systems isn't God, isn't the church, but it's society itself
[time=2844] Every man does that which was right in his own eyes
[time=2856] You can take it a whole lot of ways, can't you?
[time=2859] You can kind of take it the way that this one is so sold out and so committed
[time=2865] That you put the word "Lord" of your life here This one put the word "savior" of your life And this person who's a non-believer would probably feel that the Lord is a good teacher
[time=2878] But the whole thing is so utterly different You know who loses on all this?
[time=2886] The person on either side of this chair See what happens is, this child goes to church in the back seat
[time=2901] And on the way to church, his parents are arguing like crazy I mean they're just at it, either that or they're not talking, depending upon the mode of an argument
[time=2913] Then he gets to church and he watches his father get out of his seat, ticked off like crazy, mad at his mom
[time=2921] Walks all the way around the car and opens the door, first time, all week, he's opened the door
[time=2928] Then grabs a hold of his wife and his wife, shout out, "Smile, smile"
[time=2936] How are you? Fine, yes, love the Lord, praise him, shout out
[time=2943] And the kids watching this whole thing go on and say, "Oh man, I guess church is meant for the hypocrite"
[time=2952] That's why, friends, you find a third generation saying the church is full of hypocrites
[time=2959] You know who you don't say? It's full of hypocrites? You don't hear a second chair saying that
[time=2965] You know why? I think I live in proof in the living room Then his dad's asked to pray He comes up and he prays this great sound in prayer
[time=2981] Just like his dad used to pray But the kids saying to himself, "Man, I've never heard dad pay like that in my life" That's really something Then his dad gets invited to share a testimony
[time=3000] Here's a testimony from a second generation Christian You have to look right if you're a second generation You usually wear a red tie Some of you look old
[time=3017] There are exceptions, by the way Hi, my name is Bruce Wilkinson and I became a Christian at a young age So God got a hold of my life and ripped those rotten sins out of my life And if you've never met Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, then you need to know him This book is the most important book in my life Thank you Then you ask a first generation to give his testimony
[time=3052] You know, for the last three days, the Lord has been teaching me a lesson On the subject of dependence upon him when I don't want to depend And I have been struggling so hard on trying to practice this verse
[time=3068] That the Lord showed me last evening You see the difference?
[time=3076] This one goes back to salvation every time Why? That's all they got to talk about You know what this one goes back to? Last night!
[time=3090] And if you were asked to come on up and give a testimony about yesterday, would your mouth be empty?
[time=3096] Or would you have something to say?
[time=3099] See, this one lives with daily devotions This one comes to weekly services This one comes on Christmas and Easter
[time=3113] Why? Because mom wants me to be there Well, ladies and gentlemen, where do you sit this morning?
[time=3126] Are you committed? Are you sold out to God?
[time=3132] Or if you added kind of God and you together and when you come home After just saying to everybody, this is the most important book in your life Throw it on the top of your dresser and go watch the football game And next Sunday morning, you're frantically looking for your Bible saying to your wife
[time=3151] "Sweetheart, where'd you hide the Bible again?" And you pick it up and...
[time=3162] Where are you, ladies and gentlemen?
[time=3165] Do you understand the influence of this person on the church?
[time=3173] This person tears down this person like crazy Because they're judging them because they're not living the way they ought to be living
[time=3184] So they judge them and they criticize them and they call them words like phonetic
[time=3191] Extreme, are interested what God would call those people
[time=3197] But as for me and my house, we're not going to do that stuff
[time=3206] I remember when I was in high school, I sat here, my folks were here
[time=3214] I know all about this chair, I could describe it for another five hours
[time=3221] And I remember on the football team, I said to my dad one time I said, "Dad, dog on it, everybody else on the football team drinks but me"
[time=3232] Oh, I'm so sick of being the only guy who doesn't drink This is a great conversation, I said, "Dad, how come you and mom don't drink?"
[time=3245] Well Bruce, we used to drink.
[time=3249] You used to drink?
[time=3252] Yeah!
[time=3254] Did you like it?
[time=3256] Yeah, it was pretty good!
[time=3259] You're kidding!
[time=3264] No? What happened?
[time=3268] Well, you know Johnny up the street?
[time=3273] Well, one day after your mom and I became a Christian, we invited Johnny and his wife for dinner Johnny had seven kids He was a nice moral guy And my dad said, "We had them for dinner and we served them wine" Because we always drank wine, I was a little man And he said to me, "You know what Johnny did?" He said, "When we started to pour the wine, Johnny and his wife stood right up and said to us
[time=3306] "If you think you're a Christian and you're going to drink liquor, we don't want any part of you
[time=3312] "And walk out of the house." I'd never heard that.
[time=3319] My mom out of sighted right down that spot, no more drinking.
[time=3325] But I liked it, he said, "It's great." Well, Dad, yeah, but why can't I drink?
[time=3333] Man, I mean, I feel so out of it!
[time=3338] I wonder if there's a Johnny on your team, Bruce, who's watching you like a hawk?
[time=3348] You know, some day you're going to have to make that choice, whether or not you're committed to God when it costs sacrifice.
[time=3360] My dad, we'd go on vacation and go camping, and we'd leave, we'd take off about 3.30 Friday afternoon, all six of us kids in the back of this station wagon
[time=3370] with little patchy trailers, you know, and we took off to the woods Saturday night.
[time=3376] "Love at a clock," my dad said, "All right, time to go!" "Dad, we just got here, why are we going?" Time to get back to church, son.
[time=3386] Dad, why do we have to get back to church?
[time=3392] Bruce, I'm committed to that church, and because of that, I'm going to be there Sunday morning.
[time=3402] One time we drove all night.
[time=3404] Second chair, takes off Thursday at 3, has a big trailer, cruises along,
[time=3415] pulls back home, Sunday, 6 o'clock, too tired to get the evening service.
[time=3424] God will understand.
[time=3426] God, first!
[time=3428] All the time!
[time=3431] My well second.
[time=3433] Here, my well first, God may be.
[time=3441] Hey, Dad, why can't I drink?
[time=3444] Man, everybody else is drinking?
[time=3446] Hey, kid, don't you do that.
[time=3449] Hey, Dad, I really want to drink.
[time=3452] You're not going to do that because I told you so.
[time=3458] I told you so.
[time=3461] Conviction, I told you so.
[time=3466] But, Dad, man, why not?
[time=3469] They'll find out at church.
[time=3473] I won't be deacon.
[time=3477] Now, I don't care when you get out of my house, but not taking away from here.
[time=3485] Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't something new, is it?
[time=3494] Paul said it this way.
[time=3496] Some among you are spiritual.
[time=3499] Some among you are carnal.
