[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=93] [MUSIC - 71 seconds]
[time=175] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=179] - It's a joy to welcome you on this beautiful Sunday morning to our second worship service.
[time=185] In the last hour, we had a full overflowing crowd and when they sang, it lifted up the
[time=191] place and then to come this hour and to hear you sing.
[time=195] What a joy it is to lift our voices together and to praise God.
[time=199] Many of you come from a very difficult week, some very trying experiences, and yet there's this hour that we've set apart to say, "God, we want to focus our attention singly on you.
[time=211] We want to give you our highest praise.
[time=214] We welcome this morning, not only to you friends who are here, but to the many who join us each week for the Bible hour.
[time=220] We trust that as we worship today, that from our hearts to the Heavenly Father, we will bring forth the purest praise.
[time=229] [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=391] Praise Him, that's what we want to do on our next hymn, number 68, and your hymnals.
[time=397] Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus, our blessed Redeemer, number 68, and your hymnals.
[time=404] [MUSIC]
[time=410] Shall we stand as we sing?
[time=412] [MUSIC]
[time=414] Well, I'm the first stanza now.
[time=416] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=562] - Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=563] - This morning to assist us in that very theme
[time=569] of praising Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer is a high school musical group from Jackson, Michigan.
[time=577] They all sing together as a part of their Christian school ministry.
[time=580] They're here today to sing in our morning worship services and then we're going to whisk them out of here to minister to our high school student.
[time=588] Their name is His shining ambassadors and they today have come to do just what you've come to do and that is to lift our hearts together in praise.
[time=598] We want to praise God today, not because of the wonderful good things He does.
[time=603] Of course, we're thankful for that.
[time=605] But we want to give Him the purest praise and that is to praise Him simply for who He is.
[time=613] O Lord, you are the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation.
[time=621] By you, we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible.
[time=628] Whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things are created by you and for you.
[time=637] And you are before all things and by you, all things consist.
[time=642] For it pleased the Father that in you set off on us dwell.
[time=647] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=866] - Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=887] Obviously, our friend Pete Coby is not here.
[time=890] He's in Salem, Oregon, attending the college graduation of his daughter, Lisa.
[time=895] Joining me today is our school administrator and good friend, Steve Longbrake.
[time=899] Good morning, Steve.
[time=900] - Good morning, Rick.
[time=901] - I'm glad that you can come today and talk about our school.
[time=904] - I'm glad about that, too.
[time=905] We just had our sixth graduating class last week.
[time=908] - Well, that was an exciting event.
[time=910] As a matter of fact, the graduation speaker, Bruce Wilkinson, did such a tremendous job and you weren't able to see it in Fort Wayne because of a preemption that we're going to be showing that to you next week.
[time=923] Pete has gone, but in his absence, I would like to take just a moment to encourage you to plan on being with us on Sunday night, June the 29th, for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=934] Of course, our choir will be singing a good number of songs of patriotic and spiritual nature.
[time=941] Also, Stephen Maria Gardner will be here to be a part of the Panorama.
[time=945] And finally, a man by the name of Bruce Hanks will be doing a character portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.
[time=952] Steve, he looks like Lincoln.
[time=953] He's the same height and frame down to a mole on his cheek.
[time=957] And of course, with the name Hanks, you're right.
[time=960] He is related to the president.
[time=962] He's a very, very distant relative of Abraham Lincoln.
[time=966] The name Hanks, of course, was Abraham Lincoln's mother's name, Nancy Hanks.
[time=970] We hope you can be with us either at five o'clock or eight o'clock for the Panorama on June the 29th.
[time=976] But Steve, while here here, we'd like to talk a lot about the school today.
[time=980] Registration is going on in a number of classes are full, I understand.
[time=984] That's right.
[time=985] We have over 290 students registered in our school now.
[time=988] And that's the most we've ever had at this time of the year.
[time=991] Well, that's exciting.
[time=992] Unfortunately, a few of the classes are already full, aren't they?
[time=996] That's right.
[time=996] First grade is full with a long waiting list.
[time=999] And there are several others that are full and near full.
[time=1003] Well, we're excited about that.
[time=1005] Not excited that some people won't be able to come, but just that the response is so good.
[time=1010] If you're interested in the school, we would encourage you to write to us at 7321 East State Street here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1019] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1022] Again, that's 7321 East State Street 46815.
[time=1027] Steve, we've had a number of graduating classes.
[time=1029] You've got a chance to look back now.
[time=1032] I've been thinking a lot about those classes this week as I've reflected about our last week's graduation.
[time=1038] And it's exciting to me to think about some of the students that have gone on to college, graduated from college.
[time=1044] And this year, we've received some alumni gifts even from our former students.
[time=1047] That's a thrill for us.
[time=1049] It really is to think that the students who went through the school look back and say, that made a significant difference in my life.
[time=1057] And even as a young person, they can't be more than 21 or 22 or 23 years old.
[time=1062] They want to invest in the school.
[time=1064] Yes, that thrills our teachers and me as well.
[time=1066] Also, I'd like to thank you Bible Hour viewers for sending gifts to our school.
[time=1070] We've never solicited those from you, but several times we received money from Bible Hour viewers mentioning that they had seen us on TV and wanted to invest in our school.
[time=1081] That is exciting to think that people would become partners without our asking.
[time=1085] And today, it's not our purpose to ask either, but it is our purpose to say thank you.
[time=1090] Steve, as we talk about the schools, there are any other things on your heart you would most like to share today.
[time=1096] I think about this year and reflect as it is the end of the year, and I think about how many students have come to know Christ as their Savior, and how many of those have grown also in the Lord.
[time=1107] I see that happening every day.
[time=1109] I'm thrilled that I have a chance to work in a school where I can use the Bible and teach the truth and see students come to know Him.
[time=1117] Steve, I'm thrilled that you can do that because we reap the benefit in our daughter, Rachel, who comes home and speaks so highly of all that's happened, and particularly what she's learning spiritually.
[time=1128] I hope that you're learning spiritually.
[time=1130] Spiritual growth and constant study of God's Word is not simply for school-age children, it's for us as adults.
[time=1137] It's our vital link of spiritual food and spiritual insight to the Lord.
[time=1142] And that's why we want to offer you a booklet entitled Timeless Insights.
[time=1147] Timeless Insights is a daily Bible study tool that, in studying it, you'll move systematically through the entire New Testament in one year.
[time=1156] Limiting to the New Testament allows you to read a manageable portion of Scripture each day, and then not only reading the Scripture, but then you'll have, as it's named, a timeless insight.
[time=1166] Someone like Matthew Henry, our Martin Luther or John Calvin, will be quoted on the page just to help you better understand that passage.
[time=1175] And then a very important part called a timely response.
[time=1180] You've read it, you've heard it.
[time=1182] Now, what will you do with God's Word?
[time=1184] A way that you can apply it to your life.
[time=1186] It's been a big help to me and to many of us here.
[time=1190] We'd love for you to have a copy, so simply write to us today, and we will send you your subscription to Timeless Insights.
[time=1197] Our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne,
[time=1203] Indiana 46815.
[time=1207] Again, the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1215] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today, as we go back to the Morning Worship Service, we're trusting that God will use this hour to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus.
[time=1233] Lord, I see so much in me that I just can't get right,
[time=1248] things that weigh me down each day and steal my sleep each night.
[time=1259] In your word, I read about a piece I wish I felt.
[time=1268] But how can you forgive me when I can't forgive myself?
[time=1280] It was enough, the plan that you shed, it was enough that you rose from the dead,
[time=1290] it was enough to set me free, it was enough that you died for me.
[time=1309] He said in child, you know it hurts me so to see you struggle a lot.
[time=1322] Striving to be good enough till all your strength is gone, worn out by the fear that
[time=1335] you'll go just once into a fire.
[time=1341] But don't you know that only I could make you what you are?
[time=1353] It was enough, the blood that I shed, it was enough that I rose from the dead,
[time=1363] it was enough, is it what I could do, it was enough, it was enough, the plan that you shed,
[time=1378] it was enough that you rose from the dead, it was enough to set me free, it was enough.
[time=1393] It was enough, the plan that you shed, it was enough that you rose from the dead,
[time=1402] it was enough to set me free, it was enough that you died for me.
[time=1423] It was enough, it was enough that you died, it was enough.
[time=1453] So many souls have tested him throughout the course of time, so many still reach out
[time=1472] to him with broken hearts and minds, and every one of them will say, with no exception that
[time=1482] they find, Jesus never failed, even in the days of old he brought his people through,
[time=1498] and then he came to show his hope, and he died for me and you, he rose again to prove,
[time=1509] and every story I found true, Jesus never fails, Jesus never fails,
[time=1526] Jesus never fails, he might as well get thee behind, he said it, you cannot prevail,
[time=1538] because Jesus never fails, sometimes this world brings trouble, we find so hard to bear,
[time=1555] we know we could not make it without Jesus being there, it's so encouraging to know,
[time=1564] however deep we're in despair that Jesus never fails, so what can I do to prove to you,
[time=1578] tell me how can you deny, no harm to facts, no mysteries, it's all so kind to cry,
[time=1588] on the weakness and of your life, I'll be the first to testify that Jesus never fails,
[time=1601] Jesus never fails, Jesus never fails, he might as well get thee behind, he said it,
[time=1618] you cannot prevail, because Jesus never fails,
[time=1629] oh Jesus never fails, Jesus never fails, you might as well get thee behind, he said it,
[time=1647] you cannot prevail, because Jesus never fails, I'll tell you Jesus never, he never fails,
[time=1673] he never fails, he never fails, he never fails.
[time=1692] Our God and Father, we thank you today for Jesus Christ and his unfailing arms, and we
[time=1699] today have come to commit ourselves to you, and we rejoice today Father that your grace
[time=1706] never fails, and we would ask today that the unfailing arms of our Savior would envelop
[time=1713] and hold those who walk through the dark valleys, we would pray today for those who
[time=1719] have lost loved ones in recent days, for the family of John Chenoweth and his going to
[time=1726] be with you and his absence from his family, we ask that your unfailing arms would hold them, we pray for Paul Dryer and Paul Dell and Dave Ungerfer and others who have lost
[time=1738] loved ones in recent days, that your unfailing arms would hold them, to pray today for those
[time=1745] who walk through the dark, dark valleys of family turmoil, that you might be a light to
[time=1753] them, that your word would be a light unto their feet and a lamp unto their path, that you would give parents wisdom as they deal with rebellious teenagers, some are beyond
[time=1764] their teen years, we would pray today for spouses that you would give them wisdom as
[time=1770] they try to deal with their unfaithful maids, we pray today for single parents that you might
[time=1776] give to them encouragement and insight, that your unfailing arms might hold them, and father
[time=1783] today, we would ask you to speak to us, that it might be a word not from me, of course,
[time=1792] we want a word from you, so we ask you to speak today in Jesus' name, amen, if you have
[time=1800] your Bible with you today, I want to invite you to open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 11,
[time=1806] the last time I was speaking, we looked at verses 2 through 16, and so today we march
[time=1813] onward and come to verse 17, but before I read verse 17, I want to read verse 2 again,
[time=1820] and I think you'll see the obvious relationship between these verses.
[time=1825] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 2 begins, "Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember
[time=1833] me in all things, and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you," and verse 17,
[time=1842] "Now in this that I declare unto you, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the
[time=1852] better but for the worse." Do you see the relationships between those two verses?
[time=1858] Verse 2 he says, "Good job, way to go.
[time=1863] I praise you." Verse 17, a little more sober, "I praise you not."
[time=1872] There were things in the life of the Corinthian church for which Paul could praise them, and there were also some points that he needed to take a different posture, not always positive,
[time=1883] padding on the back, but some corrective words, "I praise you, I praise you not."
[time=1889] I'm not the apostle Paul, but I'm going to do what he did, and that's to look at our church and to say, "What is it that we should praise God, and to praise this body of people for, and what is it that we really need to own up to, and say, "Hmm, it's not good.
[time=1906] I praise you not." I hope you'll listen today, you never know I may be talking about you.
[time=1913] This older couple was driving south from Michigan to Florida, she never listened.
[time=1918] They pulled into a gas station, and the attendant says, "Can I fill it up?" The older man said, "Yes," and the wife said, "What do you say?" He wants to know if he can fill it up.
[time=1928] "Oh," she said.
[time=1930] The attendant notices the license plate and says to the older man, "I see you're from out of town.
[time=1935] Where are you going to?" The older man says, "We're going to Florida." The wife said, "What do you say?" I told him we're going to Florida.
[time=1945] A few minutes later, the man who's filling the gas tank says, "I see you're from Michigan.
[time=1950] What city?" He said, "Detroit." The lady said, "What do you say?" He wants to know what the city we're from.
[time=1960] The attendant says to the older man, "I was in Detroit one time.
[time=1964] I met this lady." She was the meanest old battle axe I'd ever met.
[time=1969] What do you say?
[time=1971] He thinks he knew you back in Detroit.
[time=1976] Some days it pays to listen.
[time=1979] They just may be talking about you.
[time=1981] He thinks he knew you back in Detroit.
[time=1983] I love that story.
[time=1984] It has nothing to do with today's message, but I was going to fit that in there.
[time=1990] Listen, we may be talking about you.
[time=1995] Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, now it's my job to clarify the scriptures, but before I do that, I want to confuse you just a little bit.
[time=2003] 1 Corinthians is actually 2 Corinthians, because in 1 Corinthians, Paul said, "I wrote to you in a former letter," so the former letter has to be 1 Corinthians making this 2 Corinthians.
[time=2014] Then in 2 Corinthians, which is really 3 Corinthians, he wrote to them saying, "When I told you
[time=2020] such and such that he never told them, except for in a letter that was between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians," which makes that letter, 3 Corinthians, which makes 2 Corinthians, 4 Corinthians.
[time=2032] All that's to say, Paul wrote again and again and again to the Church of Corinth.
[time=2038] Why?
[time=2040] Because the Church of Corinth had some things that were going really well, and he wanted to encourage that.
[time=2046] He also had some problems, and he wanted to correct that.
[time=2052] This whole book of 1 Corinthians, or you may now call it 2 Corinthians, is simply written
[time=2058] to address two things, problems that they were having and questions that they were raising.
[time=2063] You want to do a little bit of thumbing through this book with me?
[time=2066] Turn to chapter 1, verse 11, just for a quick moment.
[time=2070] You'll be introduced to their first problem.
[time=2073] Chapter 1, verse 11 says, "For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
[time=2080] who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you." One of the reasons why Paul had to write is there was a problem, there were some contentions, there were divisions, there were popularity contests, there were those who always liked things and there were those who always didn't like anything.
[time=2099] He's trying to straighten that out.
[time=2101] Look back to chapter 5, verse 1, "It is reported commonly that there is immorality among you,
[time=2111] and such immorality is not so much as named amongst the Gentiles." I mean, that's bad.
[time=2118] There was something happening in that church that was so immoral, that it was so grotesque, so socially repugnant, that the Gentiles, the unbelievers, wouldn't even talk about
[time=2129] it.
[time=2130] It was pretty low.
[time=2132] Paul was writing to correct that problem.
[time=2134] Chapter 7, verses 1 through 10, he's writing to say, "Hey, singleness isn't all bad.
[time=2142] Don't go putting pressure on people to get married." Verse 10, he's talking, he says, "Now to the married I command." He says, "Wait a minute, those you are married, don't get so excited what I said about singleness that you file." There were problems.
[time=2156] Chapter 8, verse 1.
[time=2159] Now as touching things offered to idols, that was a culturally related problem.
[time=2164] Do you eat meat offered to an idol or don't you?
[time=2167] We studied through that.
[time=2168] That was a problem there.
[time=2171] Chapter 12, verse 1, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, the Corinthians were full of charismatic
[time=2178] confusion." You got it?
[time=2180] You don't have it?
[time=2181] I thought you were a Christian.
[time=2182] Well, I thought I was.
[time=2183] Well, if you don't have it, you can be a Christian.
[time=2185] Paul said, "Nonsense.
[time=2186] Add problems." Chapter 15, look at verse 12.
[time=2193] "Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you there
[time=2199] is no resurrection of the dead?" That's pretty significant doctrinal stuff when someone says, "I don't really believe this resurrection business." Well, if there's no resurrection, then it's over.
[time=2211] We lost.
[time=2213] Let's go home.
[time=2214] We had serious problems.
[time=2216] Chapter 16, verse 2, verse 1, "Now concerning the collection," what church hasn't heard
[time=2224] that line.
[time=2225] "Now concerning the collection, will the ushers take their places a third time today?" Point is this, Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "Yes, to say I praise you for some things,
[time=2237] but on the other hand to say I praise you not." Let's take Paul's outline today.
[time=2242] Let's talk about our church.
[time=2244] Let's start.
[time=2245] I praise you.
[time=2246] I made a list this week and you could make a better list.
[time=2248] I know, but it's my job to make the list, so I made it today.
[time=2252] I said, "God, what is it this church that we ought to be saying?
[time=2255] God, we praise you for." And I also ought to be faithful in saying to this body of people, "I praise you.
[time=2262] You did well." Well, first of all, this comes to my mind more than anything else.
[time=2270] The numbers of people who are coming to Christ.
[time=2273] Last hour, two people accepted the Lord.
[time=2277] Last week, an older gentleman who's a Bible, our viewer, accepted the Lord.
[time=2281] Last week in the baptismal tank, we met somebody who accepted the Lord through an evangelism call.
[time=2286] Last Friday morning, a guy just out of college said, "Can I talk to you?" And he came in and he said, "I've got a problem.
[time=2293] Just let this guy to the Lord.
[time=2294] What do I do now?" Isn't that a great problem?
[time=2297] I'd like to see all of you.
[time=2299] I got this problem, Hawks.
[time=2300] What do you do with a new Christian?
[time=2303] That's great.
[time=2304] I don't know that there's ever been a time that we could just look across all the ministries and see how God is leading people to Christ.
[time=2312] I'm so thankful for that.
[time=2314] There's a statistic and it's true that says that 80% of the people who make a personal commitment to Jesus Christ make it before the age of 18.
[time=2325] And it is a real rarity to reach somebody for Christ in the middle of life and a phenomenon under each people in their senior years.
[time=2333] But you know, in the last three or four times we've had baptismal services, we've had people over 70 years old saying, "Last week, last month, this year, I gave my heart to Jesus
[time=2344] Christ." Boy, that's exciting.
[time=2348] Which leads me to say, "God, we want to praise you." But also, to this body of people, "Well done, I praise you." You've really caught the spirit that sharing Christ is what life is all about here on planet
[time=2363] Earth.
[time=2364] If we're not here to do anything else, we're at least here to know God and to make him know.
[time=2370] Second thing I want to praise you for are the number of people who are going on beyond salvation, who are growing in the Lord and taking a visible step of being baptized.
[time=2379] You don't have to be baptized to go to heaven, but it is a step of obedience.
[time=2383] And again, if you've missed the baptismal services of our church, you've missed something.
[time=2388] To hear John say how the three or four people came into his life, and then he came to know Christ as Savior.
[time=2396] To hear a 78-year-old man say, "Last month, I asked Jesus Christ to be my Savior, and
[time=2403] that's why I'm here tonight." Boy, you're missing something, but I just have to say, praise the Lord for the number of people who have taken that step of obedience, and you've led them.
[time=2413] Well done.
[time=2414] I praise you.
[time=2416] My list goes on.
[time=2418] I do not believe in the cloister mentality that says, "You go to Black Hawk Baptist Church, therefore we own you." I believe our people ought to go from this place out and serve, not just here, but out and serve.
[time=2432] Lifestyle of angelism is really caught on here.
[time=2435] The number of people who are just sharing Christ of their own leading, not going to classes, not that there's anything wrong with that, but you're just sharing Christ.
[time=2444] I called a group called Bible Study Fellowship and said, "Would you like to use our church if you need a place for the men to meet and meet here?" They said, "We'd love to do that.
[time=2452] We already got too many Black Hawk people in leadership." I hung up the phone and said, "God, thanks that our men and women are taking it out of this building and sharing the Word." CBMC has got to be one of the great ministries of our time, reaching businessmen and women
[time=2468] for Christ.
[time=2470] What a joy it is to go to those meetings and see so many of you there.
[time=2473] Not only you're there, but you've invited that businessman, that office worker with you.
[time=2478] You said, "Come on.
[time=2479] Let me take you to lunch.
[time=2480] Rumor has even some of you offered to buy.
[time=2483] I'm available." You're penetrating.
[time=2487] You're sharing Christ.
[time=2489] There are leaders in this community, and I say, "God, thank you for people like that."
[time=2495] I praise you.
[time=2496] Let me read you a partial list of names.
[time=2500] Brad and D. Ball, the Cranes, the Faulkners, Lori Eby, Ruth Yolcom, Bill and Joanne Suriball,
[time=2507] Denny and Debbie Howard, the ballast, Mary Cruz.
[time=2511] Those names ring any bells.
[time=2513] All of those are either couples or people as single adults who, out of this church in
[time=2519] the last four years, have said, "I'll go to the mission field." That's an army moving out.
[time=2524] I got to say, praise the Lord for that.
[time=2528] Well done.
[time=2530] You're doing great.
[time=2532] Tonight, we'll hopefully introduce to you a number of people who are going for the summer to give up their summer as adults or students say, "I want to serve the Lord in the mission field.
[time=2541] I'll raise the money.
[time=2542] I'll get the shots.
[time=2543] If that's what it takes, I'll go." It's great.
[time=2547] There are over a hundred people who are working to make our adult Bible fellowships our Flocks function.
[time=2553] There'll be thirteen or fourteen hundred people here today.
[time=2556] I can't pastor all of you.
[time=2558] I can't know that this one needs that.
[time=2560] We've devised a system of flock deacons and their wives and ministry team leaders and outreach directors, and I can't tell you how many times I've gotten a call, somebody's in the hospital, and I got there fairly quickly, and three or four people from their Sunday school class were already there.
[time=2576] You're doing a great job.
[time=2578] Praise the Lord for that, and you too.
[time=2582] Our choir, week by week, that is something to hear, and they recorded an album that's
[time=2588] excellent.
[time=2589] We're going to be going on vacation.
[time=2590] We're going to record that.
[time=2592] I don't know whether that's legal.
[time=2593] I think it is since we paid for it all, but we're going to listen to that on the way to go.
[time=2598] Purist, praise, and to be able to come and to have whatever's happening in life squelched and lifted up by a choir like that.
[time=2605] Boy, I'm thankful.
[time=2606] Pete's in Oregon, and his daughter's graduation today, but when he comes back, you encourage him.
[time=2612] You're doing great.
[time=2614] Sunday school teachers.
[time=2616] Do you know that it takes more Sunday school teachers to manage the toddlers through the
[time=2623] sixth grade than there are adults in most churches?
[time=2626] I mean, if there's one thing this church believes in, it's in having kids, and we've got them everywhere.
[time=2633] We're running the school across the street out.
[time=2635] It's yard apes, wall to wall, and straight up the walls.
[time=2640] Takes a bunch of you.
[time=2641] So many of you have served long and faithfully, and I'm a parent, and I know how well you do,
[time=2647] and I want to say thanks.
[time=2649] It's great.
[time=2650] Praise the Lord, and you too.
[time=2654] The Bible hour.
[time=2656] What a ministry.
[time=2657] Do you know, as this service ended the first hour, two people came up and said, "Hi, I feel like I know you.
[time=2662] It's my first Sunday here, but I'm here today because I've watched the Bible hour for the last three months or the last six months." This month of May, I know of three people personally who accepted Jesus Christ as Savior
[time=2677] through the Bible hour.
[time=2678] That's how they came to know Christ.
[time=2681] And you know that all the work that goes on, the cameramen, the technicians, the producing, the director, it's all done by volunteers.
[time=2689] Praise the Lord, and praise you who have made it possible.
[time=2694] A family came in and said, "Nobody asked them to.
[time=2698] They just said, 'We're going to cut all the grass on North State Street.
[time=2702] We're going to edge it.
[time=2703] We're going to trim it.
[time=2704] We're going to sweep it, and we'll do it every week.
[time=2705] We've never called them once.
[time=2706] For two years, it's done." Charlotte and Virgil Messenger said, "We're retired.
[time=2713] We got more time.
[time=2715] That's time to serve the Lord.
[time=2716] We'll go visiting every week.
[time=2717] Have some calls ready." John Anita Chenoweth did the same way, but this week, John can't go calling.
[time=2723] He's in heaven.
[time=2724] Somebody's going to have to take his place.
[time=2726] Could it be you?
[time=2729] Volunteers have just said, "I'm going to take this project and I'll do it.
[time=2732] It's great." Some days I'm embarrassed, and some days I'm proud.
[time=2739] Someone will come up to me and say, "Where does such and such a ministry meet?" And I'll say, "I'm sorry.
[time=2745] I didn't know we had that ministry." I'm at first embarrassed, and I said, "God, thanks, and our people don't wait for me to suggest something.
[time=2752] They see a need and they meet it." I've got to say, "Praise the Lord, and you need to hear it.
[time=2760] You're doing good.
[time=2762] It's really a privilege to serve the Lord and to serve Him here." I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
[time=2769] Bruce Wilkinson was here last week, and we were having lunch, and he said, "How do you really like pastoring a church?" I said, "I can't speak for pastoring a church, but if you're talking about pastoring a church, or pastoring a Blackhawk Baptist church, it is a great privilege.
[time=2780] I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world." Now I might try to trade the Midwest and the snow and the winter, but I'm not going to trade you.
[time=2789] Why don't we all move to Hawaii together?
[time=2791] I hear they need a church there.
[time=2792] Got a couple of amenes out of that.
[time=2795] It's really a joy to serve the Lord and to serve Him here.
[time=2799] Well, that's verse two.
[time=2801] Paul looked at that church and said, "I can praise you." Now there's verse 17, "I praise you not." Now the real test of maturity is, "Can we take it when somebody tells us the rest of the story?" That's a real measure of maturity, isn't it?
[time=2815] A lady went to our church and her mother was a regular Bible reviewer, and she came to know the Lord through the Bible, and said, "She's very ill will you visit her." Why went to visit this lady?
[time=2825] She spent the first 15 minutes telling me how wonderful I was, so I thought I should go back and visit her again.
[time=2830] I mean, those are the kind of visits I'm able to make.
[time=2833] I can squeeze those in.
[time=2835] She was always so encouraging, and then one Sunday, we were staying through first Peter, and the Bible was talking about predestination, election, and foreign knowledge, and all that heavy stuff, and we taught it, and I went to visit her Monday morning.
[time=2848] She said, "Didn't do so good yesterday, did ya?" I had to call four people and to tell them to watch next week because it's usually not that bad.
[time=2856] Oh, she was a sweetheart.
[time=2860] I don't know how you take that, but I have to admit, I didn't go back and visit her for two weeks.
[time=2868] Now I need to tell you the rest of the story too.
[time=2871] We're doing good in some ways, but there's also some things that I think we need to say I can't praise you for.
[time=2878] I can't praise me for it.
[time=2879] It's not you and me, it's us.
[time=2883] What would that be?
[time=2885] I really believe we're vulnerable to a major spirit of complacency.
[time=2891] That is one of the dangers of a large fellowship of people, and I would say five or six hundredths large and we're probably fourteen hundred today.
[time=2900] Complacency is that old story of the four brothers, you know them.
[time=2903] I think you live next door to those four brothers.
[time=2906] Everybody, nobody, somebody, and anybody.
[time=2908] There was a job that somebody was supposed to do.
[time=2912] Nobody did it.
[time=2913] Anybody could do it and everybody thought it ought to be done, but every time, somebody,
[time=2919] and anybody didn't do it.
[time=2921] It was always left for the little brother, nobody to do it.
[time=2924] Finally, somebody got mad that nobody was doing it and thought everybody should be doing it because anybody could do it, but nobody did it and everybody was upset.
[time=2936] That is so typical of churches and the bigger we become, the more precarious that possibility
[time=2942] is.
[time=2943] There is a rule of churches and I have never found the exception.
[time=2946] It's called the 80/20 rule.
[time=2949] It simply says this, 80% of the work of the church is being done by 20% of the people,
[time=2957] and that's true right here.
[time=2960] And 80% of the giving is being done by 20% of the people.
[time=2965] If you took a computer and we do it, it shows no names.
[time=2969] It's totally anonymous, but you spread out all of the giving, you'll discover that is this long list of givers go down when you draw the line at 20% of the givers and you come over to the dollar amount, you're already over 80% of the money.
[time=2984] Someone will say that's because some really rich people threw in some big bucks.
[time=2989] We're still waiting, no, it's just everyday people like us.
[time=2995] Nobody is carrying this church except for everybody.
[time=3001] In 80% of the money, 80% of the work is being done by 20% of the people.
[time=3006] Now, before we go much further and we talk about the I praise you not, I want to address
[time=3013] the church in three groups.
[time=3015] Maybe I should have Bruce's three chairs here, but it doesn't quite work that way.
[time=3018] First of all, if you're part of that 20% that's doing 80% of the work and 80% of the giving,
[time=3024] then you need to say to myself or yourself, I'm okay.
[time=3029] I need to hear it, but I'm okay.
[time=3032] Some of you have been teaching kindergarten Sunday School for so long that your first class is now helping you teach as college graduates, and if you're ready for a rest,
[time=3042] you need one.
[time=3043] If you were singing in the choir back in the trailers, please don't feel guilty if you dropped out a choir based upon what I said today.
[time=3051] But if you're the type of person who joins the choir and fades out and comes back and fades out and comes back and fades out.
[time=3057] If you're the type of person who teaches Sunday School and commits themselves to do it this month and next month, well, you can't quite, but for three months I can't, then you need to hear it.
[time=3069] So if you're part of the 20, relax.
[time=3073] If you're the part of the 80, listen.
[time=3076] Don't sit around the table and have somebody say, "What'd he say?" He thinks he knew you're back in Detroit.
[time=3081] You need to listen.
[time=3084] Let me just address one-third group.
[time=3088] There are some of you who are brand new to your faith in Jesus Christ, then just sit back and relax.
[time=3093] You're not supposed to know all this stuff.
[time=3096] If this is new to you, we understand that.
[time=3099] Or if you're new to Black Hawk Baptist, you've only been here a couple of weeks and just relax, but that still leaves about somewhere around 78% of us that really need to take
[time=3110] us to heart.
[time=3112] I believe the danger that we run is the danger of any large church, and that is a spirit of complacency, the comfortable death.
[time=3121] Let me give you some symptoms of complacency that I see here.
[time=3125] First of all, you can measure complacency by slipping attendances at the non-prime time.
[time=3130] I don't like to call anything non-prime time, but Sunday morning is prime time.
[time=3136] We'll pack this place out.
[time=3137] The overflow room is open this hour, last hour they were hanging on the bars.
[time=3141] Sunday comes.
[time=3143] Sunday night, there's not too service, so there's one.
[time=3146] You can close the overflow room.
[time=3148] You can close the balcony.
[time=3150] We can move down to the chapel on a lot of nights.
[time=3154] Wednesday night, it gets smaller.
[time=3157] Somebody said, "You can measure the popularity of the church on Sunday morning, the popularity of the program on Sunday night, and the popularity of the Lord Jesus at the prayer meetings."
[time=3169] And we not only have that big gap from Sunday to the other services, but it's slipping.
[time=3177] That's a sign of complacency.
[time=3180] Second sign of complacency are business meetings.
[time=3182] I hate business meetings.
[time=3183] I wish there was never a business meeting, but it's a necessary evil of life.
[time=3189] I don't even know how many members there are of this church.
[time=3191] It's somewhere around 1,300, and in the last two business meetings, there were less than
[time=3197] 25% of the people here.
[time=3200] That's back to the 80/20 rule, isn't it?
[time=3202] Now we weren't doing anything special at those business meetings.
[time=3206] Only voting on a million dollar budget, only voting on the deacons to lead the church,
[time=3212] only voting to sell a half a million dollars worth of land, and only deciding whether or not to prepay a million dollars worth of bonds.
[time=3219] It was small stuff.
[time=3222] You and your wife do, 20% of the people made that decision, 80% of the people said somebody
[time=3231] else would do it.
[time=3234] The third symptom is the masses of people who come to church and pretty regularly, but
[time=3242] who never joined the church.
[time=3244] Now I'm going to confess, I can't find one place in the Bible that even talks about church membership, then why am I talking about it?
[time=3253] Church membership simply says two things.
[time=3255] I believe what these people believe, and I'm committed to what these people are committed to, and those two things being true, they can count on me.
[time=3266] And masses of people come here, they believe what we believe, and they take advantage of what's here, but they don't want to say, "Hey, don't count on me.
[time=3275] You know, I'm with you all the way, winter time, but things could get tough."
[time=3281] Winter time.
[time=3284] Another way you can measure that complacency slipping in is inside the bulletin.
[time=3288] I'm not going to preach from the bulletin, but let me draw your attention to the inside panel, right hand page, your to date church budget, we're behind $32,000.
[time=3299] You know what's amazing is we're behind, and there's never been a point in the history
[time=3305] of this church where more people have come, and there's never been a time in the history of this church when the local economy was better, and there's more of us making more money and giving less, isn't that amazing complacency?
[time=3321] It's creeping in.
[time=3322] It's a slow death, and if we don't deal with it, we're going to be in trouble.
[time=3331] Charles Stanley wrote a book called Confronting Casual Christianity, and in that he points
[time=3338] to the temptation, not the temptation, the trying time of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane
[time=3345] as a time to see complacency.
[time=3349] Jesus says to his disciples in verse 37, "Come pray with me, watch with me." He comes back the first time in verse 38 or verse 40, and they're sound asleep, strike
[time=3362] one.
[time=3363] It was the most trying time in Jesus' life, so he takes his three closest friends, says "Pray with me," and they sleep.
[time=3370] Second time he says, "Watch and pray." Comes back, the Bible says their eyes were heavy.
[time=3377] You know that morning stuff that you wake up with, I mean that's how asleep they were, the sand man came, Jesus said, "Could you not pray with me for a while?"
[time=3387] And the third time he prays and he comes back and they're asleep a third time, strike three, and he just looks at him and he says, "Sleep on, it's too late, it's too late.
[time=3401] The hours come." Complacency is deadly.
[time=3409] What is it that I'm asking you to do?
[time=3412] I'm really asking you to do three things.
[time=3417] First and foremost, more than anything else, I'm asking you to commit your life, your soul
[time=3423] to Jesus Christ.
[time=3425] Dozens of you come to this church or stay at home and watch on the Bible hour because this is a large church and you can be comfortable, you can get lost in the crowd.
[time=3435] No one knows you're here, so no one's saying, "Have you made a commitment to Christ?" You can stay at home and watch it on TV and you're slipping in and slipping out, but you're
[time=3448] never coming to Christ and saying, "Jesus Christ, I need you as my Savior and I want you to come into my heart and I surrender to you right now.
[time=3457] Take me, take my heart, take my kingdom, take it all, I give it to you."
[time=3463] More than anything else, you need to make a commitment to Christ.
[time=3467] You need to simply humble yourself and say, "God, behind this three-piece suit or this designer dress is a heart that desperately needs Christ.
[time=3478] Come in, forgive me of my sins and give me eternal life." If you've never made that decision, you need to make it right now.
[time=3494] Thank you again for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=3517] And if, as a result of today's message, you've come to the place in your spiritual life where you know you need to have Christ as your Savior, I want to encourage you to pray with me right now opening your heart to Him.
[time=3530] Heavenly Father, I today recognize that I'm a sinner and that I know that Christ died
[time=3538] for my sins and that I want Him to come into my heart and to forgive me and to be my Savior.
[time=3547] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3550] If you prayed that prayer along with me today and you made that decision, we want to send you a hopeful booklet entitled "Your Decision to Help You to Begin to Grow in Your Spiritual Life." If you would like a copy of your decision or of timeless insights that we offered earlier today, simply write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
