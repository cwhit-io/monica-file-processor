[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=109] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=112] Now from the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it's the Bible hour with inspirational music from the Sanctuary Choir, special groups and soloists, and a message from God's Word with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=127] Join us, won't you, for the Bible hour.
[time=130] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=157] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=160] (bell chimes) I look forward to every Sunday morning and see you looking back at the platform here.
[time=170] We have one distinct advantage being up here, and that's seeing all the faces of you all, as you fellowship singing together, praying together, and then fellowshipping in the Word about the only way that I can invite you to come up here is to sing in the choir.
[time=184] And that would be all right to see me after the service.
[time=187] If you're interested in seeing the view of the congregation from the choir loft.
[time=191] We are glad that you're here today.
[time=193] It really is very important that you're here and that you fellowship with one another and have that experience of Christians joining together.
[time=200] We also welcome those that are watching on the Bible hour.
[time=204] We are here from time to time, various people that are watching.
[time=208] We read the letters and we are very blessed and have the privilege of going into the homes of many people
[time=214] and in the hospital rooms and convalescent centers in our community.
[time=218] The choir is going to sing in a moment, a song from their album that's entitled, "Holy is the Lord of Host" and it's an adaptation from Revelation 4 verses 8 through 11.
[time=227] Verse 11 says, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.
[time=234] For thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
[time=240] Holy is the Lord of Hosts."
[time=290] The Holy is the Lord.
[time=317] Holy is the Lord of Hosts.
[time=369] Holy is the Lord.
[time=382] Holy is the Lord of Hosts.
[time=587] Praise his name.
[time=588] Doing something different this morning, I'd like to have you join with us.
[time=591] Instead of singing the next hymn, I'd like to have us read scripture.
[time=595] It's found in the back of your hymnal, it's number 12, page 747.
[time=600] The page number is in the middle of the page.
[time=603] Number 12, page 747.
[time=606] Would you join with me as we think of the blessings of God from the scripture?
[time=610] And let's stand, please, as we quote the scripture together.
[time=614] I would ask that the choir begin on the first verse.
[time=617] Congregation, please respond by speaking the second verse and so on through the end of the passage.
[time=623] Let us read together.
[time=625] Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless this holy name.
[time=632] Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
[time=638] Who forgiven all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases.
[time=644] Who redeemeth thy life from destruction, who crown thee with loving kindness and tender mercies.
[time=652] Who satisfyeth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles.
[time=659] The Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
[time=665] He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
[time=671] The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy.
[time=679] He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever.
[time=684] He hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=692] For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
[time=699] As far as the easy is from the west, so far have he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=707] Like as a father pity of his children, so the Lord pity of them that fear him.
[time=714] For he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are dust.
[time=719] As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourish it.
[time=727] For the wind passeth away, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
[time=735] But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
[time=742] and his righteousness unto children's children, to such as keep his covenant,
[time=748] and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
[time=752] The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleeth overall.
[time=759] Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments,
[time=766] harkening unto the voice of his word.
[time=769] Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts.
[time=773] He ministers of his that do his pleasure.
[time=776] Bless the Lord, all his works.
[time=779] In all places of his dominion, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=785] What a privilege it is to know the Lord, and know that he knows that we are human.
[time=789] As we come together, we can confess our sins, and he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins,
[time=795] knowing exactly how frail we are.
[time=797] Thank you for the reading of the word, you may be seated.
[time=815] Thank you for something cool, all my confusion he understood.
[time=834] All I had to offer him was brokenness and strife, but he made something.
[time=844] Beautiful of my life.
[time=854] If there ever were dreams that were lofty and noble, they were my dreams at the start,
[time=867] and the hopes for life's best were the hopes that I harbored, down deep in my heart.
[time=880] But my dreams turned to ashes, my castles all crumbled, my fortune turned to loss.
[time=893] So I wrapped it all in the rags of my life, and laid it at the cross, and he made something beautiful.
[time=909] Something cool, all my confusion he understood.
[time=925] All I had to offer him was brokenness and strife, but he made something.
[time=937] Beautiful of my life.
[time=943] Sing with us, will you, he made something beautiful of my life.
[time=967] Let's praise him together by singing the chorus, there's just something about that name.
[time=972] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, there's just something about that name.
[time=990] Master, save your Jesus, like the fragrance after you in the rain.
[time=1008] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, let all your worth roll in.
[time=1026] Peace and he knows will hold us away, but there's something about that name.
[time=1045] Because he lives, sing it together because he lives, I can face tomorrow, because he lives, all fear is gone.
[time=1065] This is our confidence, sing it together because I know he holds the future, and life is worth the living just because we live.
[time=1087] My life is worth the living, mean it from your heart, and life is worth the living just because we live.
[time=1102] Thank you for that great praise, I don't know if there's anything we do in life that is better than lifting up the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1110] He is alive, he is our Savior, he is the Creator, he's our Lord, we lift him up with thanks and glory.
[time=1120] Lift up the name of Jesus, lift up the mighty King, lift up the name of Jesus, all glory to him we bring.
[time=1134] We ship the name of Jesus, our voices to him we raise, lift up the name of Jesus, for Jesus Christ the Lord is worthy of eternal praise.
[time=1152] Come and praise the name of the Lord with us, lift your voice to him who will reign forevermore, the one who broke the power of sin and death.
[time=1173] We will always rise above, we will conquer every foe. If we just lift up the name of Jesus, lift up the mighty King, lift up the name of Jesus, all glory to him we bring.
[time=1195] We ship the name of Jesus, our voices to him we raise, lift up the name of Jesus, for Jesus Christ the Lord is worthy of eternal praise.
[time=1217] Come and praise the name of the Lord with us, for he's promised that he will never leave his own.
[time=1231] The victory is ours in the name of Christ, we will always rise above, we will conquer every foe. If we just lift up the name of Jesus, lift up the mighty King, lift up the name of Jesus, all glory to him we bring.
[time=1260] We ship the name of Jesus, our voices to him we raise, lift up the name of Jesus, for Jesus Christ the Lord is worthy of eternal praise.
[time=1277] We lift up the name of Jesus, lift up the name of Jesus!
[time=1298] We are enjoying our service so far and especially the ministry of Stephen Maria Gardner. They will be with us next Sunday as we present the annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1309] We'd like to have you take note of the date June 29th, we're giving performances at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Not only will Stephen Maria Gardner be with us but our sanctuary choir and the handbell choir will be performing as well as special guest Bruce Hanks who will portray Abraham Lincoln.
[time=1326] I hope that you have the opportunity to set aside that time. Tickets are available for the 8 o'clock concert, I'm sorry to say that all the 5 o'clock tickets are gone.
[time=1336] But if you'd like to come next Sunday evening just call the office at the church at 749-8524 and they will reserve tickets for the 8 o'clock performance and that's next Sunday evening.
[time=1349] Stephen Maria will be a blessing to your hearts as they are today. Today is a special day because we have with us a guest speaker and his name is Jay Kessler.
[time=1360] Jay Kessler is the president of Taylor University. Also I have some guests on the insert. They are my friend Scott Schindler who's been working with me assisting me in the music department. Good morning Scott.
[time=1371] Good morning. And then a special guest is my daughter Lisa Kobe who has just recently graduated from Western Baptist College.
[time=1380] I ask these two young people to come with us and be in the insert today because we talk a lot about Christian education with Blackhawk Christian School associated with our church.
[time=1391] Many of our young people were honored just a couple weeks ago and having graduated from Christian schools around the country.
[time=1399] And we believe in Christian education and I thought it would be appropriate if we ask these young people some questions concerning their work and their time at Christian college.
[time=1409] Scott, you attended a couple of secular institutions and then just most recently you graduated from Fort Wayne Bible College with a music degree.
[time=1417] I want to ask you what the significance of that education particularly in music and as it relates to the church, why did you attend a Christian college?
[time=1426] I felt like especially the Bible college was preparing me specifically for the area that I was going into.
[time=1432] One big plus for the college was that they had a Christian service department which enabled me to work at my vocation while I was getting classroom experience.
[time=1442] So there was the practical part along with the education.
[time=1446] Sounds like there was a good thrust in the academic area and yet a good balance then for you to go out into the field.
[time=1452] You've been working in Christian service for the last three years at Blackhawk.
[time=1457] What are some of the activities that you get involved in here?
[time=1461] I've had the opportunity to direct the handbell choir.
[time=1465] I've played the piano and presently playing organ.
[time=1469] I've got to work in the office and do various things, work with the living Christmas tree and about all the activities that happened in the music department here at Blackhawk.
[time=1478] Actually there are some things that Scott didn't tell you about but he gets involved in just about every aspect of the music department and we're just thrilled that he's here and delighted that he's had the opportunity to attend a Christian college right in our community and then be involved in Christian service.
[time=1493] Lisa you've been involved in Christian education from day one having gone through kindergarten right up through your undergraduate work now in college.
[time=1502] What were some of the ideas that you had about Christian higher education?
[time=1507] Well I think I picked Western Baptist for the small atmosphere.
[time=1511] The closeness with the professors and the teachers and the staff.
[time=1515] The influence, the Christian influence in student government and dorm leadership were all some of the reasons that I picked Western and Christian education.
[time=1525] I think that it is important that all of these relationships are in the future and now that you've gone through the college are some of those things true.
[time=1535] Did they hold true and what were some other areas that you found to be really beneficial for you?
[time=1541] Well I'm looking forward to using my experience as I said in student government and dorm leadership to use in the future.
[time=1549] My fiance is planning on becoming a pastor in the near future and I'll be able to use some of those things as a pastor's wife and I'm also looking forward to developing even further the friendships that I've made at Western.
[time=1562] I think the relationships that these young people have with other young people that they've met through their college education will last for eternity and also as Lisa mentioned the privilege of meeting young people who have the same goals and aspirations.
[time=1576] Thank you very much for being with us.
[time=1578] These young people have set goals and priorities in their lives and that's something I want to talk about as it relates to the letters that Paul wrote to the various churches.
[time=1588] Right now we're studying in timeless insights in the June issue in First Thessalonians and it does talk about getting our priorities straight.
[time=1597] If we have goals and aspirations in our lives we have to work steadily toward them and that's true in the Christian life also.
[time=1605] If you'd like to become involved in knowing more about God's word and what it says about setting goals and priorities I encourage you to write for timeless insights today.
[time=1614] You can receive timeless insights by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1624] Let me encourage you to write today for timeless insights.
[time=1628] Thank you for being with us today.
[time=1630] I hope you'll stay with us as we continue our service in the Convocation Center.
[time=1634] Let's go back now to the live service as we anticipate more music and then the message from our special guest, Jay Kessler.
[time=1648] The one thing we know is which we can have confidence is that the Lord that we serve is God.
[time=1662] The arm of flesh will fail but he is Lord.
[time=1667] The master shared words of life a miracle meal but most came just for a show and left him that day.
[time=1680] Jesus asked the twelve will you leave me to?
[time=1687] Peter said Lord to whom shall we go?
[time=1694] We believe and are sure you are Lord.
[time=1708] Hohaki yos the holy one of God.
[time=1715] We believe and we are sure you are Lord.
[time=1726] We thank you Lord for mountain tops for miracle days when all life seems so clear and secure.
[time=1739] But when life seems dark and we don't know why in your strength we rest you are Lord.
[time=1753] We believe and are sure you are Lord.
[time=1767] Hohaki yos the holy one of God.
[time=1774] We believe and we are sure you are Lord.
[time=1782] And we know your word is true.
[time=1788] It guides us from day to day.
[time=1794] We believe and are sure you are Lord.
[time=1808] Hohaki yos the holy one of God.
[time=1815] We believe and we are sure you are Lord.
[time=1822] We believe and are sure yes we know that you are Lord.
[time=1835] You are Lord.
[time=1845] Just a reminder that Stephen Maria will be with us for our 13th annual Patriotic Panorama next Sunday evening June 29th.
[time=1853] The performances America we are so blessed will be at five o'clock and eight o'clock.
[time=1858] If you do not have tickets all of the five o'clock tickets are gone but the eight o'clock concert is still open.
[time=1864] They are available in the foyer.
[time=1866] They are free but you do need a ticket to get in.
[time=1868] Come and fellowship with us as we celebrate the reconstruction of the Statue of Liberty and the blessings of God on America.
[time=1876] Stephen Maria will be here.
[time=1877] The sanctuary choir will sing.
[time=1878] The handbells and Bruce Hanks will portray Abraham Lincoln at that time.
[time=1883] Come and be with us.
[time=1885] Now let's listen to the ministry of the quartet as they sing.
[time=1888] Jesus, He's the One.
[time=1895] [MUSIC]
[time=1901] Who can move the mountains that are hindering you today?
[time=1908] Who can pick them up like pebbles clear them from the way?
[time=1915] Who can prove His power when a Christian needs to pray?
[time=1921] It is Jesus.
[time=1925] He's the One.
[time=1929] Jesus holds all power in His mighty hands divine.
[time=1936] He's the One who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=1943] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=1949] Blessed Jesus, He's the One, the One.
[time=1957] Who can heal the heartache that is crushing you within?
[time=1963] Who can pour the balm of heaven where the hurt has been?
[time=1971] Who can chase the shadows make the song of joy beginning?
[time=1977] It is Jesus.
[time=1980] He's the One.
[time=1984] Jesus holds all power in His mighty hands divine.
[time=1991] He's the One who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=1998] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=2004] Blessed Jesus, He's the One, the Only One.
[time=2012] Who can keep you from all harm and guide you by the hand?
[time=2019] Who can give you power for service and strength to stand?
[time=2026] Who can give you grace for all that living may demand?
[time=2032] It is Jesus.
[time=2035] He's the One.
[time=2039] Jesus holds all power in His mighty hands divine.
[time=2046] He's the One who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=2053] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=2059] Blessed Jesus, He's the One.
[time=2085] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2094] Great to have that confidence in the Lord and the fact that He will individually care for our needs.
[time=2101] I mentioned in the first service that there were two important organizations in my life as I was growing up.
[time=2106] First of all, Youth for Christ in the Benton Harbor, Michigan area was a great vehicle in which to learn the things of the Lord and be with young people and grow in the things of the Lord.
[time=2118] And as I graduated from high school, I had the privilege of going to Taylor University for my undergraduate work.
[time=2123] I say this to introduce our speaker who for some 28 years, Jay Kessler was involved in Youth for Christ, 13 of those years as President of YFC.
[time=2132] Just recently, about a year ago, he became the President of Taylor University.
[time=2137] Taylor is located in Upland, Indiana.
[time=2139] We're glad that that school is in our state and close to us.
[time=2142] Many of the alumni attend our church and get it actively involved in our services and we're grateful for that.
[time=2148] We're glad that he's here.
[time=2149] I hope that you'll give him a Black Hawk welcome as we introduce our speaker, Mr. Jay Kessler.
[time=2154] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2156] Thank you, Pete.
[time=2158] I'm delighted to be at Black Hawk.
[time=2163] We've had a great service this morning.
[time=2166] You probably saw me over there tapping my foot during the quartet.
[time=2170] I always want to sound like that.
[time=2172] I sing in the shower and think I sound like that.
[time=2176] And Jenny sometimes yells in and says, "Are you right in there?" And then I know that I don't, really, but I've enjoyed the service very, very much.
[time=2185] Earlier in the service, we sang together the song "How Great Thou Art" and that song ties in with what I'd like to do today while I'm filling in for Pastor while he's on a much needed and deserved, I'm sure, vacation.
[time=2200] I'm going to preach two messages from Psalm 8 on the two great themes of Psalm 8.
[time=2206] One, the, when I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, and the other, what is man that thou art mindful of him?
[time=2214] And so let's read together Psalm 8.
[time=2217] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=2223] When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?
[time=2234] You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned in glory and honor.
[time=2239] You made him ruler over the works of your hands and put everything under his feet, all flocks and herds and beasts of the field, the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, and all that swim the paths of the seas.
[time=2250] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=2257] There is, in addition to these verses in the Psalms, a phrase
[time=2264] in memory that I consider to be maybe next to Scripture, one of the most important phrases that I know.
[time=2271] A.W.
[time=2272] Tozer has made the statement, "We tend by a secret law of the soul
[time=2279] to move toward our mental image of God.
[time=2283] We tend by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God." I think in this particular day with tremendous emphasis on science and the conquering of space and so on, it's very, very important that we as people understand the adequacy of our
[time=2303] God to handle the kind of world of which we're apart.
[time=2306] There are very few things more damaging and more pathetic really than having a person begin to adjust the size of God to fit the size of his own mind or the size of his or her own faith.
[time=2319] You may have met people who walk around with kind of a cookie-cutter, cutting out people with this cookie-cutter.
[time=2325] And then when you examine the cookie-cutter, you discover it's pretty much the shape of the person who's wielding it.
[time=2331] That is, they have certain ideas of God and certain ideas of life, and then they spend their life sort of like with McDonald's franchise trying to pass it out to other people in his exact form.
[time=2342] Well, David was thinking about the world of which he was apart, and he looked into Heaven's and was awed by the whole business, which I think is probably very true of most of us.
[time=2353] That's probably what happens to us on vacations and whatever.
[time=2356] During our work a day of life, we spend a lot of time with a furrowed forehead walking along kind of looking at the cracks in the sidewalk, but when we go into vacation or something, visit the Grand Canyon or that sort of place, we see the place that that little river has made in those rocks or we look into the sky and we say, "What is God like?
[time=2375] What could such a God be?" Well, David, as we know, was somewhat more limited than we are in that understanding.
[time=2383] A modern man understands a good deal more about the Heavens when he considers it, and as a result of that has a much more vast view of the entire thing, but it's important for us as moderns, I think, as modern Christians to expand our idea of faith to fit the cosmos of which we're apart.
[time=2403] Now, when we think about it from a modern technology viewpoint, it's, I think, sort of an interesting thing.
[time=2409] So let me share with you sort of a Carl Saganish National Geographic view of the whole thing.
[time=2415] We know that we live in a giant galaxy.
[time=2419] This galaxy of which we're apart is actually like an oblong pinwheel moving through space.
[time=2426] Now, it's quite oblong. It's five times as long as it is wide, but it's moving through space.
[time=2431] Now, for young people to understand this, you have to think of being down at the local skating rink doing crack the whip, where someone's in the middle, and then you're out there by the concrete blocks banging against the sides of the walls.
[time=2442] As it moves out there at that place where our Earth is in orbit in our galaxy, our Earth is moving along at about 136 miles per second, which is pretty good.
[time=2456] About 490,000 miles an hour.
[time=2458] So if you can get a picture of our Earth moving around our galaxy at 490,000 miles an hour, then understand it takes about
[time=2467] 200 million years for us to make one rotation.
[time=2474] That is to get around this thing.
[time=2476] Now, if you want to travel through our galaxy, if you want to travel the short distance across it, and if you can manage to move at the speed of light, that is light as you know moves right along at about 186,000 miles per second, so moving along
[time=2493] like light moves, if you want to take the short distance across our galaxy, you can cross it in 20,000 years.
[time=2500] That at 20,000 years at the speed of light, you can cross it at the short distance. Now, if you've got more time on your hands and want to take the scenic route, then you can take the length of our galaxy in about 100,000 light years.
[time=2516] Now, there are in our galaxy about 100 billion stars like our
[time=2523] sun. Now, I don't want you to feel inferior as an earthling as part of the solar system, but our sun is really one of the more mediocre of the stars. Now, it's a pretty good-sized thing.
[time=2534] It's about 100 times the size of our Earth.
[time=2537] Our Earth is about 8,000 miles in diameter. Our sun is about 860,000 miles in diameter, but one of the stars in our galaxy
[time=2546] and terries is large enough that you could put our sun, our
[time=2552] moon, all of the planets out to the orbit of Mars inside of
[time=2559] and terries, which is an interesting little thing.
[time=2563] Now, to get a grasp of our galaxies important, but it's also important for us to know that there are about 1 billion other galaxies like ours in the creation. Now, a billion is a pretty big number, just a small part of the national debt, but for us to get a piece of that, a billion, if you took a billion dollar bills on your on your singer sewing machine and sewed them end to end, a billion dollar bills would go around the equator about two and a half times.
[time=2595] There are one billion other galaxies like our own.
[time=2600] In fact, now most of these astronomers tell us that the number of heavenly bodies in the universe are the approximate same number as all the grains of all the sand, of all the beaches,
[time=2616] of all the Earth. If you went to Daytona Beach and picked up one grain of sand off Daytona Beach, there is a planet or a star for every one of those grains of sand.
[time=2627] And, as you know, current theory has it, that all of this thing I've just described was created out of matter that perhaps was compressed at one time into the space covering approximately the area of the head of a pin.
[time=2641] Now, some of you, of course, like long and wordy novels, like the Mr. novels, I like them very much. They're full of all kind of information like this, one paragraph. If our sun were the dot on an eye of a typewriter, that is, you took your typewriter and made one dot, if the sun, 100 times the size of the Earth, were a dot on your typewriter, the nearest star would be a dot 10 miles away. Other stars, up to the size of
[time=2672] a dime, would be hundreds of thousands of miles distant.
[time=2677] "We tend," said Brother Tozer, "we tend by a secret law of the
[time=2683] soul to move toward our mental image of God."
[time=2689] The Scripture begins with a very interesting phrase that says, "In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth." Now, there's moving right along, "The Heavens to the Earth." And we gather this morning to worship someone we call God. Dear God, we say.
[time=2713] Now, when I consider the Heavens, as David said he did in Psalm 8,
[time=2719] certain things happen to my daily life, for instance, when in my daily life I feel that my problems may be too big for me.
[time=2731] Do you ever have a problem that you felt was too big?
[time=2735] And maybe you even decided, "Well, maybe this is too big for God too, because after all you have sort of a flannel graph view of God, and God is put there by Sunday school teachers and you know people who claim to know God and claim to know Christ as Savior who are always protecting God and arguing about God and always have kind of tight lip and a little bit of a worried look on their face and so on.
[time=2756] And so you say, "Well, maybe God can't handle my problem." Well, if you're God's too small, that's very likely.
[time=2764] I remember one time I had a fellow come up to me after a service, and he said, "Well, J, I don't want to embarrass you." And I said, "Well, I don't want you to embarrass me either." He said, "No, I want to embarrass you, but I don't even believe in God." And I said to him, "Well, tell me what God you don't believe in.
[time=2779] Maybe I don't believe in him either." And he began then to tell me about his maiden aunt and her neuroses and whatever.
[time=2785] And as we discovered that his idea of God was really just some kind of a little teeny pinched idea that he had gotten from an aunt who every time they had a family reunion, she talked about death while everybody else was talking about ball scores.
[time=2798] And somehow or another, he didn't understand God.
[time=2802] In the beginning, God, God can handle my problems.
[time=2804] People say, "Do you think that God could speak with authority according to the Bible?"
[time=2810] Oh, yes, absolutely.
[time=2812] I mean, if there is a God, then obviously he can.
[time=2815] See, I don't believe in God because I believe in the Bible.
[time=2818] I believe in the Bible because I believe in God.
[time=2821] If there's a God, then he can speak without stuttering.
[time=2824] And he has spoken in a trustworthy, totally confident manner about the world.
[time=2829] He would say, "You're a 20th century man, Jay.
[time=2831] I mean, do you -- you actually -- I mean, do you really believe -- come on.
[time=2837] Now, do you believe that God can make a fish so big he could swallow a man?
[time=2842] I said, "Well, you can't put can and God in the same sentence." If you say, "Can," that's a limiting word.
[time=2847] When you say, "God," that's unlimited.
[time=2849] You can't say, "Can," and "God." If there is a God, then he can.
[time=2852] Could he make a fish big enough to swallow a man?
[time=2854] Well, of course, he could air condition and carpet him if he wished.
[time=2857] See, he could do whatever he chose to do because he's God.
[time=2861] So when I consider the heavens and I face problems in my daily life, I say, "If I actually can
[time=2867] get a hold of God, and if God cares about me like Jesus told the apostles, the apostles said, "How do you talk to this God?" Jesus said, "You say, "Our Father, which art in heaven." I don't know how to get a hold of God at the cosmos, but I have crawled up on my father's lap and God says to me, "Come to me." So is there any problem too big for God?
[time=2890] When I face problems, when you face problems in your life that seem too big, don't allow yourself to approach a God who's too small.
[time=2897] Our God is able.
[time=2899] He's the Creator God.
[time=2900] When the injustices of this world, the apparent inequities and capriciousness of this world,
[time=2907] do you win?
[time=2908] Do you ever, when you watch TV, you see the creeping Sahara and you see these children with the distended stomachs and you read of the terrible programs that happen on the earth
[time=2918] with hundreds of thousands of people dying and these kinds of things.
[time=2922] Sometimes we tend to say, "Well, what can I ever do?" And we feel so small and ant-like and insignificant.
[time=2929] If our God is big enough, we understand that this is the same God who came in the person of Jesus Christ to the earth.
[time=2934] And while he was yet a baby in the womb of his mother, Mary, that God spoke and in that great thing we call the Magnificat, Mary's great song,
[time=2945] God is the protector of the weak and the oppressed and the poor and the disenfranchised
[time=2952] and the helpless on the earth.
[time=2954] Yes, God does care.
[time=2955] And yes, God is concerned.
[time=2957] In fact, the Negro spiritual probably says it best historically.
[time=2962] Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows but Jesus.
[time=2965] Jesus will solve all of my sorrows.
[time=2968] This is what the Bible teaches us, and God is concerned.
[time=2971] God has not gone on a vacation.
[time=2973] He's not asleep.
[time=2975] His ear is not heavy that he can't hear and his arm is not shortened that he cannot save.
[time=2980] When I feel lonely and deserted and misunderstood, when I'm filled with grief and don't know where I can turn, when I stand at the casket of a child or a mate, when I awaken in the night and am conscious of my finitude and I cry out, oh, and I have that terrible fear and that emptiness in my heart, Scripture says he comes to fill that.
[time=3007] He's the, what the Scripture calls the paraclete, the one that sticks closer than a brother,
[time=3013] the friend that walks alongside with the hand on the shoulder, the Holy Spirit, he calms the heart that's full of heaviness and full of grief.
[time=3024] If we know the God of the Scripture, we know a God who can meet our need, even when we feel so inconsequential.
[time=3030] Jenny and I have just moved from Chicago.
[time=3032] You drive into town, six lanes of traffic going this way and six lanes of traffic coming that way, and you think, could God ever care about my needs?
[time=3040] Well, I often think if Uncle Sam can find us all on April 15th, I'll guarantee you God can find me right now.
[time=3047] And when I cry out to God, I know that His Holy Spirit can come and soothe my heart.
[time=3053] When I fear for the future, when I realize that on this earth we have enough, the equivalent of TNT, roughly ten times the weight of that grand piano, judging it weighs about 400 pounds, there are 4,000 pounds of TNT equivalent for every man, woman, and child on the face of the earth.
[time=3075] Every child in Sumatra, every child in Manila, every child in Bangladesh, every child in Fort Wayne, every human being, can you imagine?
[time=3082] It's almost more than you need, right?
[time=3084] 4,000 pounds of TNT.
[time=3087] And then we watch with confidence as politicians come before us and say their thing and we think, "One of these has his finger on the button." I mean, this is pretty scary.
[time=3097] When that happens to me, I look into the heavens and I consider God and I realize that the world to God is not like a pinball machine on tilt.
[time=3106] The whole thing is not a confusion to him.
[time=3109] They're not having committee meetings in heaven.
[time=3111] Nobody's jumping nervously from one leg to the other with a little giggle.
[time=3115] There's none of this sweat in the palm or brow in heaven.
[time=3120] God is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=3124] Young couples come to me constantly and say, "Should we have children?" I mean, Jade, you read what's happening.
[time=3129] Aren't there vectors in the world all heading towards some cataclysmic end and so on?
[time=3134] Oh yes, I suppose so.
[time=3136] But in the meantime, yes, children, yes, grandchildren, yes, great-grandchildren,
[time=3142] yes, great-great-grandchildren.
[time=3143] Now, the Lord could return in a millisecond.
[time=3146] No question about that.
[time=3147] The Lord Jesus could come before I finish this sentence.
[time=3150] But if he doesn't choose to, day is a thousand years and a thousand years is a day.
[time=3156] This planet may be there until the end.
[time=3159] We know the old Charles Wesley phrase, "What would you do if you knew that the Lord, he was hoeing in his garden?
[time=3165] What would you do if you knew the Lord was coming before nightfall?" He said, "I'd finish this role.
[time=3171] I'd do what I'm doing.
[time=3173] We have confidence.
[time=3175] We don't have to be fearful and afraid.
[time=3177] Fear not, little flock." Peter said, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and it fate is not a way reserved in heaven for you, the blessed hope." If we have the right God, if our God is too small, then these things frighten us and cause us to crumple and we have nervous breakdowns and things come unglued.
[time=3204] When I realize that I've sinned, when I get beyond a child's understanding of the world, when I understand the implications of my activities, and I know that my actions have implication and consequence, when I realize that God is a heavenly Father and he is an eternal God and he's holy and righteous, he is light and in him is no darkness at all and I know that I've sinned, what can I do?
[time=3232] Lie on a couch and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and pay fifty dollars and talk and talk and talk and pay another fifty and talk and talk and talk and talk and find out to air is human?
[time=3241] See, I would love to forgive everybody their sins.
[time=3246] I'd love to say, "Oh, that's okay. Oh, come on.
[time=3249] Put a little sunny side at the top, give a man gloom to shake.
[time=3252] Look at the full glass, not the empty.
[time=3254] You know, don't look at the whole, look at the donut.
[time=3256] You know, lice a bowl of cherries.
[time=3258] I'd love to soothe everybody's country.
[time=3260] But I can't soothe everybody's conscience because I didn't make the heavens and the earth.
[time=3265] God made the heavens and the earth.
[time=3267] And it's that God who reveals himself in Jesus Christ.
[time=3270] Philippians 2, it says, "Though he was God, he did not cling to his prerogatives as God's equal but became a man and dwelt among us.
[time=3278] That Jesus who dwelt among us who was not a pint-sized version of God.
[time=3283] Don't get the idea that Jesus was some kind of an anthropomorphism.
[time=3287] Jesus Christ, according to Hebrews, is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person." The minute his trial said, "You've claimed to be God." And he says, "Thou sayest it.
[time=3301] You've seen me, you've seen the Father.
[time=3304] It's that God who says, "Come to me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I'll give you rest." What's this labor?
[time=3311] What's this heavy ladenness?
[time=3314] It's the sin of our life that Jesus says, "Come to me, and I'll give you rest." When I consider the heavens, I understand that God has chosen to reveal himself perfectly in Jesus Christ.
[time=3327] "We tend," said Brother Tozer, "by a secret law of the soul to move toward our mental image of God." I don't think there's anything quite as dangerous in this world is to have a truncated, pinched, inadequate view of God.
[time=3345] We must understand that the God who made the macrocosm and the God who made DNA in the microcosm, that that God is the same God described in Scripture, whose Scripture begins with and says in the beginning, "God created the heavens and the earth." And it's that God to whom we pray on Sunday morning, and it's that God to whom we appeal when we say, "God, forgive us our sins in Jesus Christ." And it's that God who wants to have an intimate relationship with every human being on the face of the earth.
[time=3377] A very, very dangerous thing to have the wrong God.
[time=3382] Because when you do, then you start getting nervous, and you start putting him in a box, and you start defending him, and you start getting frightened, and then you come across a problem in your life that your little formula doesn't fit, and then suddenly you find yourself.
[time=3396] They say, "Where's old Freddy?" He used to go to church or whatever.
[time=3398] "Well, such and such happened in his life, and he just kind of faded away." And he went, "Why? Because God let him down?" No, because he had the wrong idea of who God is.
[time=3410] What I'm attempting to say to us this morning is this, that the God who made the heavens and the earth can handle my problem and yours.
[time=3416] He can handle the scientific age.
[time=3418] He can handle everything that you and I face.
[time=3421] You know, there are two situations that if you ask people about them, they usually remember.
[time=3426] If you say to somebody, "Where were you the moment you heard that John Kennedy was assassinated?" They'll usually tell you exactly.
[time=3433] They'll say, "I was in my garage.
[time=3434] I was putting insulation up above whatever." That's what I was doing.
[time=3438] And then if you say to them, "What were you doing?
[time=3440] The moment you saw these two plumes go into the sky and part like this, and then kind of come down, that terrible space shuttle tragedy?" They'll usually remember that too.
[time=3454] What I'm saying this morning is this, that the God who made the heavens and the earth saw all of that and it didn't surprise him a bit.
[time=3463] He can handle every bit.
[time=3465] I heard people say, "What happened to those people?" Well, if they knew the Lord Jesus is the Savior, they're in heaven with Him right now.
[time=3471] The absence from the body is to be present with the Lord.
[time=3474] And if they didn't know the Lord is Savior at that moment, then according to Scripture, they're separate from God, but they're alive for eternity separate from God.
[time=3483] And so this morning, there is a secret law of the soul.
[time=3487] There's a secret law of the soul that we tend to become like our mental image of God, or that God would help us to follow the God of the New Testament and the God of Psalmate and the God of David and the God of Scripture.
[time=3501] We're going to sing a song.
[time=3503] We've been sharing with you the special music from our guest, Stephen Maria Gardner and the men singers, and then the message from God's word from our special guest speaker, Jay Kessler, who's president of Taylor University.
[time=3517] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual life, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray with you.
[time=3525] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3528] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3535] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3541] I ask you to do that today.
[time=3543] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3547] If you've made a decision today, will you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3552] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
