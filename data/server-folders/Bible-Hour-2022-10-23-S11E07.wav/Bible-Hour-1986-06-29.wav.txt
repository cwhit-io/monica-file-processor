[time=170] To seek my face and turn from their wicked way, then will I hear from heaven, and then will I heal their land.
[time=180] Welcome to our morning worship this service this morning on this weekend in which we as a church will be celebrating 210 years of liberty.
[time=189] We're delighted that you're here to worship with us and want to say a special word of greeting to our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=197] Today we have a special program in the evening that we call the Patriotic Panorama, a tribute to God and to this country thanking God for the freedom and for the liberty that he has given to us.
[time=210] Thank you for worshiping with us today. Listen now as our choir sings a song that speaks of the liberty we have today.
[time=219] [MUSIC - 151 seconds]
[time=383] Song we sang this morning concerning liberty refers to the Statue of Liberty and the freedom that it allows in America.
[time=390] Reminds us two of the cross where Jesus Christ died for our sins rose again so that we could have liberty in Christ.
[time=398] Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross.
[time=402] This song is inappropriate to sing sitting down, so will you join with me taking your hymnals and sing together, hymn number 618.
[time=410] We'll stand and sing the first, third and fourth stanzas together.
[time=415] [MUSIC]
[time=428] Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross.
[time=437] [MUSIC]
[time=465] Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross.
[time=473] [MUSIC]
[time=480] Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross.
[time=495] [MUSIC]
[time=521] Stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of our cross.
[time=530] Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross.
[time=603] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=607] Let's continue our celebration on this Lord's Day as we listen to Kevin Rowe as he ministers to us with a song that's entitled Celebrate.
[time=617] [MUSIC]
[time=634] Hallelujah, O praise the Lord in all of his ways.
[time=641] Hallelujah, come celebrate his excellent way, celebrate.
[time=650] For the Lord is great, celebrate.
[time=654] He is rich and loves celebrate. Let your voices to the sky celebrate.
[time=664] In his righteousness celebrate. In his faithfulness celebrate.
[time=672] Let your praises to the sky.
[time=679] Hallelujah, O magnify him over the earth.
[time=690] Hallelujah, come celebrate his infinite work celebrate.
[time=699] For the Lord is just celebrate. He is rich and loves celebrate.
[time=707] Let your praises to the sky celebrate. In his righteousness celebrate.
[time=717] In his faithfulness celebrate. Let your voices to the sky.
[time=730] [MUSIC]
[time=746] Celebrate. For the Lord is just celebrate. He is rich and loves celebrate.
[time=756] Let your voices to the sky celebrate. In his righteousness celebrate.
[time=765] In his faithfulness celebrate. Let your praises to the sky.
[time=778] [MUSIC]
[time=785] Again we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=789] Pete and I are on the set of the Patriotic Panorama and I am certainly looking forward to tonight's concert.
[time=795] Rick we had a good rehearsal last night, our final rehearsal in preparation for today's concert.
[time=800] This is our 13th annual Patriotic Panorama entitled America We Are So Blessed.
[time=806] I wish that I can invite every one of you to join us for tonight's performances.
[time=811] Unfortunately the tickets are completely gone for the 5 o'clock concert and only a handful of tickets remain for the 8 o'clock concert.
[time=819] Of course if you want to come at 8 o'clock and risk the chance of getting a ticket we don't want to discourage you.
[time=825] This is our opportunity to say Father in Heaven we are so thankful for this great country that you've given to us with all of its freedom.
[time=834] We have a couple of special guests for the Panorama. Yes some of the people in Fort Wayne are familiar with Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=841] They'll be with us, they're members of our church and they tour full time Rick but we're just delighted we've booked them about 2 years ago for this concert.
[time=849] And then Bruce Hanks will be with us. He portrays Abraham Lincoln. Looks just like him is the same size, height and weight and even age that Abraham Lincoln was at the end of the Civil War.
[time=861] So that'll be an exciting event as he portrays and re-enacts speeches that Abraham Lincoln gave many years ago.
[time=868] Well I'm certainly looking forward to that. Today we also want to share with you a very special ministry called Timeless Insights.
[time=876] Perhaps the best way for me to do that is to tell you one illustration of something that happened right here in Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=883] A family was watching the Bible hour. They had some very personal needs in their marriage.
[time=889] So they decided to come to Black Hawk Baptist Church and after coming they took advantage of the counseling ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=897] The very first session with the counselor, the counselor said, "More than anything else you need a spiritual foundation to your marriage."
[time=904] And he gave them a copy of Timeless Insights and they began to read God's Word together as a couple.
[time=911] Just this week I received a letter from that couple saying how the counselor gave them Timeless Insights.
[time=917] They began to read God's Word and they'll obey the principles of it and what a difference that simple step has made in their marriage.
[time=925] Timeless Insights has no magical power but it simply is a guide to get you into God's Word.
[time=932] And when you're in God's Word then you begin to abide in Christ and Christ abides in you.
[time=938] We want to help you to be in God's Word by sending you Timeless Insights.
[time=942] You simply need to write to us today and ask for your free copy and we'll be glad to send you Timeless Insights immediately.
[time=951] You can write for Timeless Insights by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=961] Just ask for Timeless Insights, that's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne Indiana, 46815.
[time=970] Before we go back to the live part of our morning worship service, we want to invite you to join us on Thursday nights for some very special events that we call the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=982] This coming Thursday, July the 3rd, we have as our speaker and guest, Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=989] Many of you will recognize that name immediately because Pastor Jeremiah was the founder of both the Blackhawk Baptist Church and the Bible hour.
[time=998] For the past five years, he's been ministering in San Diego and he's with us this week as our guest.
[time=1004] We want to encourage you to join us here at Blackhawk at 7 o'clock Thursday night, July the 3rd, to hear Pastor Jeremiah's message.
[time=1011] Back in Fort Wayne once again.
[time=1014] And then coming on the 10th of July, we have a special musical guest.
[time=1018] Yes Rick, it seems like each week is exciting and something different.
[time=1022] When we get to July 10th, we will be having Steve Green.
[time=1026] Steve Green was last year's musician of the year, male vocalist.
[time=1030] He has an outstanding voice, a fine testimony and you will not want to miss July 10th at 7 p.m.
[time=1037] That's a Thursday evening.
[time=1038] Well we're looking forward to those events, hope that you are too and we certainly hope that you can join us.
[time=1044] I'm anxious to get back to the live part of our morning worship service so we can save the time to study God's Word.
[time=1050] If you don't have your Bible in your hand, would you get it right now so that you can study with us on God's message to the Church of Corinth, but equally to you and to me today.
[time=1061] Thank you for joining us.
[time=1068] Shall we pray?
[time=1070] Father, we truly are blessed people and as we stand before you this morning, we thank you for those blessings that you've given us personally.
[time=1077] Those blessings that you've given us as a congregation, those blessings that you've bestowed upon us as a nation.
[time=1083] And Lord, as we give you thanks for that today, we just pray that we would use that to bring honor and glory to your name, all that you've given to us, that we would see people come to know Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.
[time=1095] And for those of us that already know you as our Savior, that we would grow and become more mature and that we would share with others.
[time=1102] Again, Lord, as we would give our gifts today, that we would just pray that they would be used by this Church to bring honor and glory to your name.
[time=1110] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1125] [MUSIC - 167 seconds]
[time=1307] (audience applauding) This morning we applaud not only because a song was sung and with excellence,
[time=1320] but because in our heart there's a desire to say yes, that's my song, that's the message of my heart.
[time=1327] God, we today thank you for this country and the grace that you have given as we have made a theme for this day, America, we are so blessed.
[time=1338] God, thank you for the blessing that you have poured out upon this country.
[time=1343] We today recognize that the freedom and the prosperity and the security that we know as a nation is the very blessing of God upon this people.
[time=1354] Father, your word has reminded us that righteousness, exultination,
[time=1360] and that sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=1364] So today, Father, we not only pray for our leaders, but we pray for our people, that they might have a hunger to know you and to please you, so that as we seek your face, you are free to bless us.
[time=1376] Father, today we thank you for President Reagan and Vice President Bush, and for their families and their commitment to this country, and for the labor and the industry and the wisdom they bring to their offices, and pray for you to bless them, and that you would give them extra wisdom.
[time=1395] We thank you today for our Congressman Dan Coates and his wife, Marcia, and the dual commitment they have to you as Savior and to this community.
[time=1405] We thank you for Richard Luger and Dan Quail, for the local governmental officials who seek to administrate our community.
[time=1413] May you give to them insight so that they make decisions not simply based upon popularity,
[time=1420] but based upon insight that comes from you.
[time=1423] Father, we pray for churches today, that there might be in the churches of this country
[time=1429] a calling to repentance so that the people of this land might hunger and thirst to know you.
[time=1435] We thank you today for your blessing upon this church, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1443] Today, before we study the Scriptures, it's a privilege for me to introduce someone to you that I knew was going to be here this week, but I didn't know today, but I believe there's a distinguished haired, gray haired gentleman in the back who is smiling by the name of Pastor David Jeremiah.
[time=1459] He was our pastor and our founder.
[time=1461] David, if you and your family would stand, we would like to honor you today and welcome you back to Blackhawk.
[time=1467] Welcome home.
[time=1469] It's a joy to have you back with us.
[time=1479] For those of you who don't know it, Pastor Jeremiah will be speaking here at Blackhawk in our summer Bible conference this coming Thursday night, July the 3rd at 7 o'clock, and Stephen Morale will be singing, and you'll want to be here.
[time=1493] We encourage you to come. Both you are friends here and those who are watching by way of television.
[time=1497] Well, this past week we've had vacation behind us and we've had a little extra time to think and study, and I've been going through 1 Corinthians chapter 11, and I've come to a new insight.
[time=1509] A biblical principle that I want to share with you.
[time=1511] It may surprise you just a little bit, but it's biblical.
[time=1515] I hope you'll hear it, and I hope you'll heed it.
[time=1518] Coming out of 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 17, this new insight from God's word simply stated it's this, don't go to church.
[time=1528] Now some of you, I just undermined everything you've been trying to do with your family.
[time=1532] I can picture many of your homes.
[time=1535] For those of you who have little ones like I do, you probably had to literally pry them away from the Sunday morning cartoons.
[time=1542] For those of you who have teenage daughters, some of them locked themselves in the bathroom this morning because their hair didn't turn out just right.
[time=1550] Many of you men walked by your golf clubs at least six or seven times this morning.
[time=1556] You had to put that leather grip drive in your hand just to fill it and to wave it into the sunshine and say please be there after church.
[time=1564] And you've labored to get your family here and then hawks says don't come to church.
[time=1568] How could that possibly be?
[time=1570] Let's read this passage.
[time=1572] In Corinthians chapter 11 verses 17 through 22.
[time=1576] Now in this that I declare unto you, I praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.
[time=1587] For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you and I partly believe it.
[time=1599] For there must also be heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
[time=1608] When ye come together therefore unto one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
[time=1615] For in eating, everyone takeeth before the other his own supper
[time=1621] and one is hungry and another is drunk.
[time=1626] What have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of God?
[time=1636] And shame them that have not.
[time=1640] What shall I say to you?
[time=1642] Shall I praise you in this?
[time=1645] I praise you not.
[time=1648] The church of Corinth is a church as we've looked at for a number of weeks now that was full of problems. Some of the problems have gotten so bad that Paul had to write to them and say, wow, it would be better for you not to come to church.
[time=1663] By the time you get together and all the things that go wrong in your fellowship, it would be better that you didn't even assemble together.
[time=1671] Don't go to church if it's going to be like this.
[time=1674] Well, what was so wrong with the church of Corinth that Paul came to that stark conclusion?
[time=1681] Well, what was wrong in Corinth was not unique to that community.
[time=1685] It's very possible.
[time=1686] It's very potential for any church then or now.
[time=1690] Corinth or Fort Wayne?
[time=1692] Let me just list the three problems quickly and then we'll look at them at length.
[time=1696] The first problem is found in verse 18. It says this.
[time=1700] For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions.
[time=1706] That was the first problem, divisions in the church.
[time=1709] Verse 19 says, "For there must also be heresies." That's the second problem.
[time=1716] And then verses 20 and 21 give us the third problem.
[time=1720] When you come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
[time=1724] For in eating everyone take it before the other is own supper, one is hungry, another is drunk.
[time=1731] Let's call that third problem the problem of excess.
[time=1735] Divisions, heresies and excess.
[time=1739] Now the apostle Paul said, "I've heard these things about you and I partly believe them."
[time=1745] Remember that little line, "Would you? I partly believe them." Somehow, when the story gets told the first time to the second time to the third time,
[time=1755] by the time you or I hear it, the story is they say down south a little gooder than it ought to be.
[time=1762] We had a very wise kindergarten teacher here at Blackhawk.
[time=1766] During orientation when she had all the parents together before school ever started, she made a deal with the parents.
[time=1773] She said, "I'll make you this deal.
[time=1775] I won't believe everything that your little boy or girl tells me about you
[time=1781] if you won't believe everything they tell you about me." That was pretty wise advice for a kindergarten teacher.
[time=1788] Kids can come home with some real stories, but you know adults are the same, and particularly when we hear a story about someone else, it gets exaggerated, it gets heightened, it gets worsened as it goes along.
[time=1800] I don't know whether you ever had the experience, and I won't tell you how often I did, of scoring somewhere below a D on a test.
[time=1808] Have you ever had that experience?
[time=1811] If you were like me during one of those experiences, after you took a harsh look at your grade,
[time=1817] the first thing you did was to stretch your neck out, and look around in hopes that somebody else did equally as well on the test.
[time=1825] It's not only that Misery loves company, but there's just something about being able to go home and tell your parents, "Why wasn't the only one?" Why is it that we like it when somebody else fails the test, too?
[time=1837] Or when another church doesn't meet their budget, or when somebody else is going through problems?
[time=1844] I think it's because we look at our life, and we say, "I'm here." And I really know I ought to be here.
[time=1852] And I feel this internal guilt and inadequacy about where I'm at compared to where I ought to be.
[time=1858] But I would feel a lot better if you were down here with me, and I would feel great if you were somewhere lower than I was, and it would improve my self-esteem a great deal to know that you were worse.
[time=1869] And so we look almost with a proving proud eye at someone else's failures.
[time=1877] During the Chernobyl incident, a Soviet reporter was on American television and said,
[time=1883] "And I fear he was right.
[time=1885] You Americans are gloating in our disaster.
[time=1889] It makes you feel good about yourself." Let's never feel good about ourselves at someone else's expense.
[time=1898] There were problems in Corinth.
[time=1900] Word had spread through the Mediterranean world.
[time=1903] Did you hear about Corinth?
[time=1905] Man, that church is in bad shape.
[time=1908] Someone called it the first church, "What's happening now? Wow. What a place." Paul said, "I've heard it, and I partly believe it." That's saying two things. One, he's saying, "I think some truth is here, and we need to deal with it." But I also know that there's some redeeming character there, and it's not as bad as they say.
[time=1928] Those three problems.
[time=1930] The first is division.
[time=1932] The word is schismata, from which we get our word schism.
[time=1935] That really means almost a violent tearing, a ripping apart, a fracturing.
[time=1941] And the obvious result, if you take something that's one and tear it, you now have two or more.
[time=1948] Paul said in the Church of Corinth there were divisions. They were torn apart.
[time=1953] Back in chapter 1, verse 10, he begins to address divisions in that church that were based upon personalities.
[time=1961] There were those that liked the Apostle Paul's personality.
[time=1965] He was very, very evangelistically minded. He had a vision of literally winning his world, the Christ.
[time=1972] There were also different teachers. There were men like Apollus, who were very skilled, very capable orators, and very deep teachers of the truth.
[time=1983] And there were those that lined up behind Paul for his missionary and evangelistic zeal.
[time=1988] But there were those that said, "Well, we really need to get deep into the Word and mature, and I like Apollus."
[time=1995] There were those that said, "Well, I like a man's man. Both these guys are too much of city slickers for me.
[time=2000] I want somebody I can understand, and well, I can understand Peter." And so they lined up behind the personalities. That was one form of division.
[time=2010] But there was a different form of division that he's really addressing here.
[time=2015] A little bit of historical perspective. The early church had a habit that they called the agape.
[time=2021] Many of you have been around churches long enough to know that that is a Greek word for love.
[time=2027] They called it the agape or the love feast. We today would call it a church potluck dinner, and that actually is what it was.
[time=2035] Everybody in the church was encouraged to come early to share in a meal together, and everybody brought a dish or two dishes,
[time=2041] and they brought them in, and they sat them down, and then somebody blew a whistle, and they attacked the serving tables,
[time=2047] and just like here. And there was a sharing together of a meal.
[time=2051] But that meal had a far greater significance in their culture than it did in our culture.
[time=2056] In that particular culture, that feast, that meal served two very unique purposes.
[time=2063] First of all, it was a way of actually sharing together in common.
[time=2068] In Acts chapter 2, verses 41 through 48, the Bible tells us that the early church stayed in the doctrinal teaching the apostles,
[time=2076] and they went from house to house breaking bread, and no man viewed his possessions as his own,
[time=2083] but they held everything in common, and they literally shared together.
[time=2088] And so this agape love feast was literally a meal that was designed for the feeding and the sharing of the body.
[time=2096] One historian says this would be the only meal that many of the poor and the enslaved would have during the week that was of any substance in value.
[time=2105] It was a way of sharing. But secondly, this meal was not only a way of sharing, it was a way of depicting the unity of the body of Christ.
[time=2116] The Greco-Roman world of that day was a very sectarian divided culture.
[time=2122] You were either a Jew or you were a Gentile. You were either a Greek or you were a barbarian.
[time=2131] You were either a patrician or you were a plebeian. You were either a free man or you carried a notch on your ear that said you are a slave.
[time=2141] You were either a man or you were a woman.
[time=2146] It was a society that said if you're not male, you're inferior. If you're not free, you're inferior.
[time=2152] If you're not a citizen, you're inferior. You were very social, very ethnic, very economically minded.
[time=2163] And now the Apostle Paul by the inspiration of God in Galatians chapter 3 verse 28 writes these words.
[time=2170] For in Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek. There is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female.
[time=2181] But in Christ there is one body that envelops and includes every person regardless of their sex, regardless of their economic or social status, regardless of their economic background.
[time=2192] They are one and nearly church took over the world because people saw their love and their unity as one body.
[time=2201] And this love feast was designed to bring them together and to say we are one in Christ Jesus and we sit down and we share together a meal.
[time=2213] But unfortunately, that unique service of the church that was designed to break down social barriers and class distinctions began not to break them down and to obliterate them but to sharpen them and to heighten them.
[time=2230] You see what happened were those who were of means and of culture and of background, they came and they congregated together on their one side.
[time=2241] And those who brought in the more fine cuisine, the quiche le reign and the accompaniments, they went over here with their table and they swapped their recipes.
[time=2250] And they made it so clear that if you weren't of their social standing, you needed to migrate to your corner.
[time=2257] And those of you who were poor and you only had biscuits that were day old, you brought those over here.
[time=2264] And maybe you could share those with somebody who had just a little broth but no beef and you could dip and that would be your meal.
[time=2271] But don't expect that you can bring these used biscuits and trade them in on quiche le reign, you can't do that.
[time=2278] That's not fair. And so there were those that brought much and they went to their own corner and they divided into their social economic group and they indulged themselves.
[time=2291] They ate first and they ate the finest and they took of the best of everything, even to the point of excess of wine.
[time=2298] And this group that had so little came together over here and they shared it.
[time=2303] By the time they got done sharing it, there was so little that they left the love feast hungry.
[time=2312] And the Church of Jesus Christ turned into a class conscious click.
[time=2320] If that's the way it is, Paul said, you're coming together is not for the better but for the worse.
[time=2329] It would have been better that you didn't even come together if you're going to divide the body of Christ.
[time=2336] It would have been better that you never came together.
[time=2342] You know, there's such great danger in our culture today to subtly bring about those same events.
[time=2349] To be so economically minded, to be so class conscious that this church over here, this is an upper class church.
[time=2358] This class over here, this is a lower class church.
[time=2362] This class here, it's a middle class church, but it's working hard at being an upper class church as though that makes it a better class church.
[time=2371] There is a black evangelist by the name of Tom Skinner who influenced my life as a teenager when I heard him speak several times.
[time=2381] One of the gripping truths that he said is this, the most segregated hour of the week is 11 o'clock Sunday morning.
[time=2391] And the most integrated hour of the week is 1 o'clock Sunday afternoon, where you see at 10 o'clock the church meets and at 1 o'clock the NFL meets.
[time=2403] Isn't it amazing how when you come to a football game, black, white, American, European, when you come to a soccer game, nationalities come together, rich, poor, you come to church.
[time=2418] Not always that way.
[time=2423] I started to say I don't know how the tradition came about that we got dressed up for church, but I do know how it came about.
[time=2429] Do you know why we get dressed up for church? Someone will tell you because it's Sunday and we want to show God our best.
[time=2435] Well, God can see your best even if it's in the closet.
[time=2438] You really want to know why we get dressed up?
[time=2441] It comes out of rural America, 17 and 1800s. Most people had two sets of clothes.
[time=2447] They had their everyday work clothes that they wore literally every day out on the farm.
[time=2453] They never saw anyone. They just worked in the farm in those same clothes day in and day out.
[time=2458] But on Sunday they would hitch up the buggy and they would take their Sunday going to meeting clothes out of the closet and they would put those on and they would go into town and there they would have their only other clothing on.
[time=2474] Out of that came the tradition that we get dressed up for church.
[time=2478] Out of that has come the tradition that church is a place to show off the latest in fashion, the latest in clothing wear, the latest in design.
[time=2488] That is no place in the church. None.
[time=2492] I'm not going to try to break the tradition by next week showing up in my jogging clothes that I've jogging for five days and say let's get back to rural America.
[time=2501] But the point is simply this. The church should not be divided because this group of people dresses really well.
[time=2510] Now, these group of people are trying but they just don't have any taste other than what's in their mouth.
[time=2515] And churches really become that.
[time=2518] We become very conscious of, well, we like to be with these people because they have all the toys that we have.
[time=2525] We don't really like to be with these people over here because, well, they just don't have what we have and then we feel guilty that we have it.
[time=2532] You know the theme of the yuppies, don't you? The yuppies say this. The one who dies with the most toys wins.
[time=2542] And America says if you've got it, flon it! I mean, what good is it if you have it if you can't let everybody know you've got it.
[time=2550] So we drive our success. We wear our jackets, labels out.
[time=2557] That's what happened in Corinth.
[time=2564] Listen to this old line.
[time=2568] He drew a circle and shut me out. Rebel Heretic, a thing to flout.
[time=2575] But love and I had a wit to win.
[time=2579] He drew a circle that took him in.
[time=2583] Let's draw big circles.
[time=2587] Somebody of a different social economic class than you are, draw a big circle, include them.
[time=2595] You know, we not only have the down and outers in our society, the people who are the have-nots who feel so abandoned and alienated,
[time=2603] we also have a large group of up and outers, people who've been successful.
[time=2608] And because they're successful, that silent, large majority of the middle class makes them feel equally as excluded.
[time=2618] Wouldn't it be great if nobody had any idea how much anyone else had?
[time=2622] And we saw people as people and not as products.
[time=2628] Draw big circles.
[time=2632] Include that person who thinks a little differently than you do politically or socially.
[time=2638] But if they're thinking biblically and they do other things in life differently, make sure you've got a big circle.
[time=2645] The second problem they had was the problem of heresies.
[time=2650] That's a harsh word, isn't it? So harsh that we often don't use it today.
[time=2656] It refers to someone who is either holding a doctrine or a behavior in air.
[time=2664] Paul said there must be heresies among you.
[time=2669] He said there must be heresies, I think there's something implied there and there's something explicitly stated.
[time=2676] Implicit is this, there's always going to be hypocrites in the church.
[time=2683] Wherever you get a group of people together in the name of Christ for ministry sake, not every one of those people is going to live up to all that they profess.
[time=2695] It's inevitable that whenever you amass two large auditoriums full of people like this,
[time=2701] not every one of us is going to do all that we say that we're going to do and be all that we say we ought to be.
[time=2707] That's why Jesus taught the parable of the bird in the tree, that's simply a way of saying there's something in the tree that really doesn't belong there.
[time=2715] There was something in the church of Corinth that really didn't belong there.
[time=2718] There are quite a few of us in Blackhawk who are a long way from being what we ought to be.
[time=2727] But you may be sitting here today and saying that's right, that's why I'm not going to get too excited and too committed.
[time=2733] Well, friend, you're the double fool. They're the first fool for not following Christ.
[time=2739] You're the second fool for not following Christ because of another fool.
[time=2746] Don't ever use someone else's misconduct as an excuse or a license for your own.
[time=2752] There's always going to be hypocrites.
[time=2755] But explicitly, Paul was saying here that there are going to be some heresies and they need to be there, and this is a purpose clause why so that they who are approved might be made manifest.
[time=2768] You see, as long as you're always surrounded by people who think the way you think, who do things the way you do things, then you're going to be very secure in those value systems until someone comes along and challenges them.
[time=2781] And then that will either make you or break you.
[time=2784] In my own life, I've had the privilege of going to Taylor University, Talbot Seminary, Grace Theological Seminary, and Concordia Theological Seminary.
[time=2792] I made a deal. They promised to pass me. I promised not to come back.
[time=2796] In all of that, I received a great deal of godly Christian heritage.
[time=2801] But I also spent three years at the University of Akron, a major, 25,000 student, secular state university.
[time=2810] Western cultural traditions was required.
[time=2813] The professor had a degree in divinity, but it was as liberals could be, and he made the purpose of his class undermining the beliefs of conservative Christianity in the Bible.
[time=2825] Day after day, I sat in there and listened to this highly educated man attack Christianity, and I owe him a debt of gratitude, because all he did was strengthen my faith.
[time=2838] Because you see, until that day, I just accepted everything I heard and never knew why I believed what I believed.
[time=2846] Until somebody as a heretic challenged what I believed, and that forced me to go into God's Word and to see what God said, and not just what my idol, my hero, Dave Burnham said.
[time=2860] And for the first time in my life, I became a thinking Christian instead of a sponge Christian.
[time=2866] Howard Hendricks, who is one of the great Bible teachers of our time, is very witty and often crude, and I'm going to borrow on both of those today.
[time=2875] He says students show up in his classes at Dallas Theological Seminary with their Bible on one hand in their umbilical cord on the other hand and say, "Hey, prof, where do I plug this thing in at?"
[time=2887] You know, thousands of people are in churches today saying, "Hey Sunday school teacher, hey choir director, hey pastor, spoon feed me, where do I plug this thing at? Please don't ask me to think."
[time=2902] Paul told the Church of Berea that they were more noble than the Church of Thessaloniki because they searched the scriptures daily to see if what Paul was saying was true.
[time=2915] And a little heresy, underlined the word little, a little heresy is a good thing because it makes us say, "Hey, that's not what I've always heard.
[time=2925] Who's right?" and start thinking. And when that happens, the result is those who are approved are made manifest.
[time=2934] You put a little bit of confusion into a group of growing Christians, they'll smell it out just like that, they'll get into the scripture, they'll find the truth and they'll refute it and they'll grow by it.
[time=2948] You put a little bit of confusion in a group of parasites and you'll just hear a whole bunch of "Oh my, what should we do so well?"
[time=2959] And they'll just live with it. And a little bit of fire, a little bit of heat will show us who's who, which are you?
[time=2971] And somebody says something just a little different the way you've always heard it. Did you head for cover or did you start digging and saying, "What did you say about that God?"
[time=2982] Just because somebody wrote a book doesn't make it right. And certainly just because somebody says it on television doesn't make it true.
[time=2991] The test is not the expansiveness of that ministry. It is doesn't fit the Word of God.
[time=3005] The problem in Corinth was there was a little bit of heresy that turned into a lot of heresy and very few of them even knew that it was wrong.
[time=3015] They didn't know that divisions were wrong. They didn't know their doctrines were wrong. They didn't know their social values were wrong because they had developed into a class conscious click instead of a serious group of people tuned in and turned on by God's Word.
[time=3031] That was their second problem. Their third problem was that they were a church given over to excesses, verse 20. When you come together, therefore, under one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
[time=3046] Let me just explain something to you. The early church had this agape love feast quite often, probably weekly.
[time=3056] That was sort of a preliminary to their church service that followed with what we call communion.
[time=3062] Now, we don't always have a love feast, a carry-in dinner, but we still have communion quite often, and the two have been slurred together so that we now call communion the Lord's supper.
[time=3074] One little girl, when she was served communion, said, "If this is the Lord's supper, he must not have ate too well."
[time=3080] When they're talking about the Lord's supper here, they're not talking about the communion. They're talking about this love feast that was meant to do two things.
[time=3088] Remember to share together and come with what they possessed and secondly to depict the unity of the body of Christ. Neither was happening.
[time=3097] And Paul then says, "What you're doing is not the Lord's supper, and don't call it the Lord's supper."
[time=3103] Whatever you're doing, don't hang God's name on it. Leave him out of it.
[time=3110] You know, one of the things that is heartbreaking is to hear the number of things that are so liberal, so permissive, so licentious in our society being done in the name of freedom in Christ, and we start hanging God's name on things that he and his word says are deplorable and despicable.
[time=3130] And that's what had happened here. They were getting together and they were being excessive, indulgent, they were drunk, they were sectarian, they were heretics, they were greedy, and they called it the Lord's supper and Paul said, "No way, that is not the Lord's, leave his name out of it."
[time=3147] One is hungry, another is drunk. Three things. One is that these people were excessively rude.
[time=3159] They came in, they grabbed what they could get, and they took it over their table, and they staked out their claims that this is mine.
[time=3167] And before everyone else got a chance to have a little, there were those who, because of their position in their prominence, said, "I've got to have a lot, I deserve it."
[time=3177] They staked out their claim. They were excessively rude. Secondly, they were excessively gluttonous.
[time=3185] They took so much, and they indulged in so much, that what was meant to design to feed hundreds only fed a few, because they took so much.
[time=3195] Pardon the crudeness, but in the Roman world, gluttony was a virtue.
[time=3201] The patrician class would have great feasts that turned into great drunken brawls that turned into great orgies, but at that first level of the feast, they literally had vomitorians.
[time=3211] Where if you were a neuroma and you would go and you would eat and eat, and when the eating wasn't over and you couldn't eat anymore, you would simply go, regurgitate your first helping so you could have more.
[time=3222] And the measure of a macho man was how many times he could go through that cycle.
[time=3227] I don't know that it had gotten that bad in the Church of Corinth, but you can see that what was happening is there were takers who said, "I've got to have more and more and more."
[time=3240] They were excessively rude, they were excessively gutless, and they were excessively drunk.
[time=3247] The ancient world wine was not a taboo.
[time=3252] It was wine that was deluded below what our wine is today, and it certainly wasn't the alcohol or card liquor that we talk about.
[time=3260] But there were no taboos against that, and it was used in the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=3264] Some would like to say that they didn't do that, but it's really hard to say they got drunk on grape juice.
[time=3269] But if you can make that work, go ahead, I can.
[time=3272] They drank wine.
[time=3275] The Bible is full of admonitions about not being drunk and wine.
[time=3279] It warns us that strong drink is a mockery, and wine is raging, and whoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
[time=3287] And these people came, and instead of just taking that which was reasonable to drink, they had to party.
[time=3293] Celebrate, party, fiesta, good times forever, all night long.
[time=3300] Ever hear those words before?
[time=3303] That's the theme of America.
[time=3305] That's Lionel Richie.
[time=3306] That's what our life's about.
[time=3308] That's when we brought the world to America for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
[time=3312] We brought in someone to say fiesta forever, all night long party.
[time=3317] That was the values of these people.
[time=3320] And they literally came to church as a place to get drunk.
[time=3324] You see why Paul said don't go to church?
[time=3327] It'd be better for you to have never come and to come into that situation.
[time=3334] What was the result of all this?
[time=3337] Verse 22, he poses some rhetorical questions.
[time=3341] What?
[time=3345] Have you not houses to eat and drink in?
[time=3348] Paul wasn't saying, "Man, if you want to get drunk, if you want to get plastered, go home." He wasn't saying, "That's all right." He was simply saying, "Whatever you do, don't do that in the church." If you're going to have a lousy testimony, at least don't corrupt and indict all of us with you.
[time=3366] Or despise you the church of God and shame them that have not the effect of their divisiveness,
[time=3373] their heretical views and their excessive lifestyles was twofold.
[time=3377] First of all, he says, "You're despising the church." By that he's saying, "You don't have enough regard for the church that you want to protect its testimony."
[time=3387] You dislike the church that much that you don't care about its testimony?
[time=3392] At least if you don't care about your own life, don't indict the rest of us with you.
[time=3399] The church of Corinth was known around the world for its improprieties.
[time=3407] And the second thing is they humiliated the brother or sister of lesser means.
[time=3414] They were embarrassed. They were rejected.
[time=3418] They felt stepped on, pushed aside largely because that's what they were, stepped on and pushed aside.
[time=3428] Paul said, "It'd be better for you to have never come together at all."
[time=3437] This whole service was supposed to be a sharing.
[time=3441] A celebrating that we're one body in Christ and that Jews and Gentiles can embrace each other,
[time=3447] that slaves and slave owners of days gone by can find forgiveness for each other.
[time=3453] Men and women are no longer gaps apart but they stand as equal before God.
[time=3459] Jesus Christ died on the cross to bring about a new society that had been gained and now lost.
[time=3471] How can it be gained again?
[time=3473] It can be gained again by each of us individually giving our heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3479] And secondly getting our head, our thinking into God's Word.
[time=3483] And so we think like God thinks and not the way society thinks.
[time=3488] Have you given your heart to Christ? If not, you need to do that today and do it now.
[time=3504] We've been sharing with you special music by our church musicians Kevin Rowe and Kerry Johnson and the message from God's Word from our pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3518] Before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3521] Will you bow your heads and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3530] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3536] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
