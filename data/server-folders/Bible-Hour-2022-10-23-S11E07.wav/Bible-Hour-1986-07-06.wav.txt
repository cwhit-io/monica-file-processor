[time=60] A foreign diplomat once gave this toast on Independence Day.
[time=82] To America, he said, "Congratulations on the second-greatest day in history."
[time=90] Well, obviously, everyone was shocked at those words, but then he went on to explain,
[time=96] "December the 25th is the greatest day in history, the birthday of Christ.
[time=102] For had there not been a December the 25th, there would have never been a fourth of July."
[time=108] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. We're glad you've joined us.
[time=119] On today's telecast, Rick will be speaking from Deuteronomy 8 in a message he has entitled, "When a Nation forgets."
[time=126] Throughout this holiday weekend, we've heard much about independence and freedom, but today, Pastor Rick is talking about another type of freedom, the freedom of the heart.
[time=136] Listen today as we celebrate both Independence Day.
[time=140] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Deuteronomy Chapter 8 so that you can be ready to study with us.
[time=147] Also featured on today's program is special music by the Sanctuary Choir, along with our own Kevin Rowe and Marcia Ives.
[time=155] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=163] It is our prayer that the Lord will speak to you through today's message.
[time=167] Now let's join the congregation as we begin the regular worship service.
[time=171] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=255] The Psalm says, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord."
[time=262] This is a particularly great holiday not only as we celebrate the 4th of July
[time=268] and the 210th anniversary of the birth of America, but this year, uniquely the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty.
[time=279] We as a nation stand in awe of a gift from France that would symbolize the freedom
[time=286] that this country possesses, that there is a greater statue of liberty,
[time=292] the cross of Jesus Christ, where God gave his son, that we might know the liberty, the freedom of the heart.
[time=299] We hope that today as we celebrate America, that you'll also see the hand of the God who is truly blessed America.
[time=307] We are people who are so blessed.
[time=309] Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.
[time=312] Welcome to our morning worship service today.
[time=315] We pray that through our singing, the choir and the study of God's word that today you will sense that God has a plan not only for this country, but for your life.
[time=325] Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our friends who join us for the Bible hour.
[time=330] We trust that today this great celebration of America would also be a great day of liberty in your heart.
[time=336] Please listen now as our choir and Kevin Rowe minister to us in music, singing about the Statue of Liberty.
[time=366] There's a lady with a torchlight standing all alone.
[time=376] For years she stood in silence, opening her home.
[time=386] Her hope is for our rainbow, whose colors won't divide.
[time=396] Her dream is for our freedom to stand side by side.
[time=408] Sometimes it seems this lady's life surely might end.
[time=418] Some have tried to put her out, lock her doors from within,
[time=428] but they couldn't crush her spirit in the land of the free.
[time=438] Still stands our lady of liberty.
[time=451] God bless the lady of liberty.
[time=460] And God bless her dream for you and for me.
[time=469] Then her flame burns forever bright.
[time=474] On love and truth may she cast a light.
[time=479] That lady of liberty.
[time=488] May she magnify God's goodness in giving us this land.
[time=498] May she serve to remind us of His gracious hand.
[time=510] For God bless the lady of liberty.
[time=520] And God bless her dream for you and for me.
[time=529] Then her flame burns forever bright.
[time=534] On love and truth may she cast a light.
[time=539] That lady of liberty.
[time=554] And God bless her dream for you and for me.
[time=563] And her flame burns forever bright.
[time=568] On love and truth may she cast a light.
[time=573] God bless the lady.
[time=578] Oh God bless the lady, oh God bless the lady of liberty.
[time=598] God bless God bless the lady.
[time=623] [APPLAUSE]
[time=633] [MUSIC]
[time=655] And with our voices we will live your day.
[time=663] Your loving kindness will not be in vain.
[time=670] We thank you Lord for all you for our homeland.
[time=683] And all the freedoms that we have because are new.
[time=691] We make this declaration to the God of creation.
[time=702] You are the only strength that we hope to do.
[time=715] On every thought she stands, all be by your hand.
[time=721] With heartfelt praise we raise our love to you.
[time=727] [MUSIC]
[time=752] We make this declaration to the God of creation.
[time=759] You are the only strength that we hope to do.
[time=778] With heartfelt praise we raise our love to you.
[time=793] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=932] Again we want to take a moment to say thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=938] We sincerely pray and hope that God uses this hour together to strengthen each of us in our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=947] I know God does that primarily through two things.
[time=950] His word and music that's given in praise.
[time=953] And Pete we have a very special concert coming up on Thursday night to do just that.
[time=958] Yes Rick in conjunction with our summer Bible conference that we've been running throughout the summer on Thursday evenings we're fortunate to have Steve Green with us.
[time=966] I listened to Steve on record for a number of years and finally saw him in concert a couple years ago and not only does his voice permeate with the love of Christ but he has a great testimony that we bring his wife along and that's going to be a very exciting evening.
[time=982] This Thursday that's July 10th at 7 p.m. in our Convocation Center.
[time=987] I know Steve Green has been nominated and has also won a number of awards and many of the songs that I've listened to over the last year on Christian radio are songs that he's recorded and I didn't always know that but one of the songs that I particularly remember you singing has proclaimed the glory.
[time=1004] I'm going to request that song. It's a great song to sing personally because it just has such power to it but I'm sure when you hear Steve Green sing it you'll just be blessed by it.
[time=1015] He's sung such songs is broken and spilled out just really message oriented songs.
[time=1021] And wasn't he one of the people who early recorded People Need the Lord?
[time=1025] People Need the Lord was another one of his popular songs.
[time=1028] We hope that you can join us this Thursday night at 7 o'clock for a concert with Steve Green.
[time=1034] There are no tickets and there is no admission charge.
[time=1037] You can simply come Thursday July the 10th at 7 o'clock and we would love to have you join us right here.
[time=1044] A free offering will be how we'll handle the expense.
[time=1047] Yes Rick.
[time=1048] So that way you don't have to purchase a ticket or worry about the cost.
[time=1052] You can enjoy the concert without any worry about standing in line to get a ticket and how many concerts are there.
[time=1059] You can just come. This one's open. We hope you can join us.
[time=1062] I would encourage them Rick to come early because I think because of the advertising and the popularity of Steve Green the building will be full that evening.
[time=1070] So come a little early and enjoy the fellowship of the people and then be prepared for the concert at 7 o'clock.
[time=1076] Well we're studying through the book of 1 Corinthians. Today being a holiday weekend we're going to leave 1 Corinthians just for this one Sunday
[time=1085] and look at the concept of what makes a nation great.
[time=1088] And we'll be studying from Deuteronomy chapter 20.
[time=1091] But then next week we'll return to a study through 1 Corinthians.
[time=1095] And as our study progresses we're going to be moving into those chapters that talk about spiritual gifts.
[time=1101] Gifts like helps, governing, tongues, healing, discernment.
[time=1108] And I don't know of a more appropriate or contemporary issue than the issue of what does the Bible say about spiritual gifts.
[time=1116] Perhaps the gift that is the most talked about is the gift of tongues. What does that mean?
[time=1122] Well before we even begin the study I want to share with you that we have an open heart and an open mind towards people of different backgrounds and different opinions.
[time=1131] Yet we also feel a constraint and an obligation to teach God's Word. We hope to do that graciously and to do it in a winsome way.
[time=1140] Today to help you begin our study we have a booklet entitled "Tons" by Charles Swindall.
[time=1146] As many of you know he is probably my favorite author today.
[time=1152] And this booklet will give you some thorough study of 1 Corinthians chapters 12, 13 and 14 with some principles that each of us can understand and apply to our life.
[time=1163] Perhaps you've been wondering what is behind the tongues issue. Is it for today or is it something of the days gone by?
[time=1170] Please write to us and we'll be glad to send you a copy so that you can be just a little bit ahead of us in our study of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1177] Write to us today and we'll send you a copy.
[time=1180] You can receive the booklet entitled "Tons" by writing to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1191] Thank you Pete. In just a few weeks we're going to be leaving the Black Hawk Baptist Church for one Sunday and taking the congregation, the television ministry, the choir and just about everything around here that moves down to the Grand Wayne.
[time=1205] That'll be a grand celebration at the Grand Wayne.
[time=1208] We did that one time last year and it certainly was an encouragement to see all of our people in one auditorium at one time.
[time=1215] We see the people coming and going. It's very fast moving pace here in our normal sanctuary but that's going to be an exciting time as our entire congregation as well as guests join us for the grand celebration at the Grand Wayne.
[time=1228] We hope that you can join us. The date for that is three weeks from today. On July the 27th we'll be having one service at 10 o'clock and I hope you can be there and be a part of it.
[time=1239] Now we're going to return to the live part of our morning worship service. I hope that you have your Bible in hand open to Deuteronomy chapter 20.
[time=1269] Our across the sea. Let us wear allegiance to a land that's free. Let us all be grateful for a land so fair.
[time=1298] As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.
[time=1320] God bless America. Land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her through the night with a light from above.
[time=1345] From the mountains to the prairie to the ocean white with foam. God bless America.
[time=1364] My home sweet home. God bless America. Land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her through the night with a light from above.
[time=1393] From the mountains to the prairie to the ocean white with foam. God bless America.
[time=1416] My home sweet home. God bless America. My home sweet home.
[time=1445] My home.
[time=1457] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1465] Thank you, Marsha. That's not only a song that we love as a people. It's the very prayer that we hold as a congregation for this country.
[time=1473] That God would indeed bless America. A foreign diplomat was toasting the United States on Independence Day, and he said to America, congratulations on the second greatest day in history.
[time=1488] Some of our diplomats were somewhat disappointed that he would say that Independence Day was the second greatest day, and then he explained.
[time=1497] For December the 25th is the greatest day in history, the birth of Christ, and had there been no Christmas, there would have never been a Fourth of July.
[time=1508] God, we bow before you today because we recognize that you are preeminent, that you are before all things, and of you all things consist.
[time=1519] We recognize today that America is not simply the productivity of people. It is the product of the blessing of God, and we worship you today.
[time=1529] And as we give thanks and honor to our forefathers and preceding patriots, God, we are recognizing that the course of American history is nothing less than the course of God blessing of people.
[time=1544] God, we certainly have not merited or deserved your unique blessing. And so today we thank you for your grace, your unmerited favor that you've given to us.
[time=1556] God, we thank you for a country where liberty is not only known, but it's a way of life, that we are free to choose our own careers, our own faith.
[time=1569] We're free to assemble in this place and to declare our love for you. We thank you that our children are born and they're born into families that has the right to raise those children as they see the leading of God.
[time=1585] We thank you that there is no state that says that they will take control of our children. Father today, we thank you for the prosperity that you've given.
[time=1595] We recognize that it's not by might nor by power, but by your spirit that we have prospered. We recognize that today and we give thanks.
[time=1606] We pray that as a church that there might come from this body of people, a seed of thanksgiving and a seed of revival that would change the course, if not of all history, at least this community, but give us a vision that is bigger than ourselves.
[time=1622] We pray today that as a body of people, we might sense you in our midst. You're the one teaching and strengthening and encouraging.
[time=1631] We pray that you would encourage the heart of Gary Lupp as he's faced so many surgeries and procedures on his leg.
[time=1638] We pray for Judy Nussbaum as she battles again for her health. We would pray that you would strengthen Judy and her family.
[time=1647] We pray today for families that are torn apart because one has found that obedience to you is too high a price and they chose to follow their own appetites and they've destroyed a marriage in a family that you would strengthen and sustain them.
[time=1665] We pray today for Ray York and his wife Essie as he walks through such a dark valley. We pray today for Sandy Priest and their son Todd and Jeff's death.
[time=1678] God, we ask that you would give wisdom and strength and encouragement to each heart, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1689] I would like to read a quote to you that when I heard it, it certainly grabbed my attention. It's a little longer than you might suspect, so please give me your attention just a moment longer.
[time=1702] The quote I read is this, "Whereas it is the duty of nations as well as men to owe their dependence to the overruling power of God and to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with the assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon.
[time=1725] And to recognize the sublime truth announced in scripture and proven by history that those nations only who are blessed are those whose God is the Lord.
[time=1742] We have been the recipients of the choices, bounties of heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity.
[time=1755] We have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown, but we have forgotten God.
[time=1768] We have forgotten the governing hand that has preserved us in peace and prosperity and strengthened us.
[time=1776] We have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our own minds that these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom or virtue of our own.
[time=1788] We have become intoxicated by unbroken successes. We have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us."
[time=1810] That quote sounds like something you might hear today in a newscast from a conservative commentator with a religious bias.
[time=1819] Or maybe these words would come from the lips of some revival preaching pastor, but actually these are not modern words and they do not come from a pulpit.
[time=1831] They are 123 years old. The year was 1863, the spokesman Abraham Lincoln on the verge of the great battle of Gettysburg.
[time=1848] The key line is this. We have forgotten God. The Scripture speaks about the nation who forgets God.
[time=1860] Open your Bible, if you will, to the book of Deuteronomy and the 8th chapter. Before we even read this text, I want to make a theological concession.
[time=1874] The passage that we're going to read today is not written for or about America. It was written for and about the nation of Israel.
[time=1883] And one of the great dangers that we often make in biblical study is to take a verse out of context and to take this book and to simply say that every promise in the book is mind, mind, mind.
[time=1895] Every song, every stanza, every line is mind, mind, mind. That's not true.
[time=1901] Some of these verses were directed to unique groups of people and those were promises that belonged to them and not to everyone else.
[time=1910] For us to open the Bible and to say every promise is given to me and every promise is given to America is like going down the street and opening up every mailbox and saying all this mail belongs to me.
[time=1921] Now, wouldn't that be exciting if you can open up your neighbor's mailbox and pull out a document that says, "Congratulations, the stock in which you invested has taken a split and each stock has increased in value and your productivity has doubled this year." Wouldn't that be exciting? You could just take their stocks and their certificates.
[time=1939] But it wouldn't be so exciting if you took their utility bill, their house payment, their kids' college tuition. No, those belong to them.
[time=1948] Now, God made a promise to Israel. He promised them. He would feed them man in the wilderness.
[time=1953] But I can't open up my door in the morning and go about in the backyard and say, "Okay, God, where is it?"
[time=1959] The passage that we're going to read today was given to Israel.
[time=1964] And yet it teaches what I believe to be a timeless principle.
[time=1969] God's giving a principle to Israel as to how they should govern their land, but that principle is timeless.
[time=1976] Let's read together. I'll read aloud. You follow Deuteronomy chapter 8, beginning in verse 1.
[time=1984] "All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers.
[time=1999] And thou shall remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee.
[time=2011] To know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no.
[time=2019] And he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know, that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only.
[time=2037] But by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live.
[time=2045] Thy reignment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell these forty years.
[time=2054] Thou shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.
[time=2065] Therefore thou shall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways and to fear him.
[time=2073] For the Lord thy God bringeth thee unto a good land, a land of brooks and water, a fountain and depths that spring out of the valleys and hills, a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees, and pomegrants, a land of olive oil and honey,
[time=2097] a land wherein thou shall eat bread without scarceness, thou shall not lack anything in it, a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass,
[time=2111] when thou hast eaten and art full, and thou shall bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he give thee, beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes,
[time=2132] which I command thee this day, lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein, and when thy herds and my flocks multiply and my silver and my gold is multiplied,
[time=2148] and all that thou hast is multiplied, then I heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
[time=2165] who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought, where there was no water,
[time=2177] who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint, who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end,
[time=2196] and thou say, in thine heart, my power, and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth, but thou shall remember the Lord thy God,
[time=2211] for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, and he may establish his covenant, which he swear unto thy fathers, as it is this day, and it shall be,
[time=2225] if thou do it all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
[time=2240] And the nations which the Lord destroyed before your face, so shall ye perish, because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God.
[time=2258] That is a powerful passage, isn't it? Rich with promises and potentials, but strong in warning and admonition, perish, live, obey, disobey, high contrast.
[time=2276] It spoke unto a nation at a crossroads in their life, a second crossroads. Israel had been led out of bondage, got to deliver them from the hand of Pharaoh, taking them through the Red Sea, fed the manna in the wilderness, and he brought them to a crossroads called Cady's Barnia.
[time=2293] And their spies were sent into the land, God said go in and take it, because I'm going to give it to you all of it. Two of the spies, a minority, report came back and said, this is a great land.
[time=2306] And they brought fruit so big that it took two men to carry the cluster of grapes. That's pretty impressive. Those were before the days of herbicides.
[time=2318] And they said, this is a great land. Let's go. God will give it to us. Let's take it now.
[time=2325] But ten of them said, well, they're right. It is a productive land. But it's already inhabited, and you ought to see these guys.
[time=2336] I mean, they're huge, and we're just like a little itty-bitty grasshopper. And so ten of them against two persuaded a nation to fear and to not obey.
[time=2349] And so they wandered in the wilderness for ten, twenty, thirty, forty years until one generation died off.
[time=2361] That generation is gone now. A new generation stands before an old leader, Moses, approximately a hundred and twenty years old.
[time=2372] And God says, give them the law again. That's what the word Deuteronomy means. Deuterot means a second, a twice doing, a repeat, nomos means law.
[time=2382] Deuteronomy is simply a restating of the law. Why? Because a whole new generation has grown up.
[time=2388] They didn't hear Moses come down off a Sinai and say, thus say it to the Lord. So God says, give them the law again.
[time=2397] Because they are now at their crossroads. Will they go into the land and possess it? Or will they back down in disobedience and fear?
[time=2405] Chapter eight can be divided into two different sections. Verses one through nine is Moses speaking to them, challenging them to get ready to go into the land.
[time=2416] And verses ten through twenty say, once you go into that land, here are the principles that you need to follow once you're in there.
[time=2424] One is the establishing of a nation. The other is the guiding of a nation.
[time=2431] Let's look first at that section on establishing a nation.
[time=2436] He begins with a principle, the principles found in verse one. All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do so that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give unto your fathers.
[time=2455] Now this statement is a conditional clause or a result clause. It's denoted by the little words that fall in the middle, that word that you.
[time=2470] He is telling them on the one hand that if they obey God, then the result will be that God will do something for them.
[time=2480] He says, if you keep the commandments and the statutes that he's given, you observe to do all of them, then God will give you the result that first of all you'll live.
[time=2492] That's good news because the last generation died and they could die right there in the wilderness, but God says, I'll let you live.
[time=2501] Secondly, I'll not only let you live, but you will multiply. These people saw all that they had being dissipated in the wilderness. They went in with huge flocks and came out with only a fraction of it.
[time=2513] God says, but all that you have will multiply. You'll prosper in one word. And not only that, you will possess the land, but all of that is contingent upon obedience.
[time=2527] If you remember nothing else from today, remember this simple formula. Obedience produces prosperity. Remember that. Obedience produces prosperity.
[time=2543] That's not only the theme of this chapter. It is the theme of the book of Deuteronomy and it is the theme of the books of Deuteronomy. Joshua and Judges put together.
[time=2553] I've taken in my Bible and I did this years ago. You won't be able to see it from there. But I drew an ascending line through the verses that teach this principle that obedience produces prosperity.
[time=2566] And the descending line through the verses that teach disobedience produces failure.
[time=2573] And in my Bible, the book of Deuteronomy has lines ascending and descending everywhere because again and again and again Deuteronomy teaches that simple principle.
[time=2584] And that principle is the understanding not only the book of Deuteronomy, but the book of Joshua and Judges as well.
[time=2591] Because as you follow the book of Deuteronomy, Moses dies. Joshua is appointed leader. And all of this is restated right up front in Joshua chapter 1.
[time=2601] Do what I say, harken into my voice and you'll prosper. And the book of Joshua is like one great line ascending upward towards prosperity.
[time=2611] Oh, there are a few dotted defeats when they disobeyed God. But overall, the times in the life and the recorded book of Joshua is a time of great prosperity.
[time=2621] And conversely, the book of Judges is just the opposite. Judges instead of beginning with saying, "Obey God and prosper begins with this statement."
[time=2630] And every man did that which was right in his own eyes. It was a day of situational ethics, a day of personal freedom of choosing to do my own thing.
[time=2640] And the book of Judges instead of victory after victory is defeat after defeat after defeat.
[time=2649] Now the principle is this, observe to do.
[time=2654] Now notice that he doesn't just use the one word obey, but he says observe to do.
[time=2659] It is our responsibility to know God's word first and then secondly to obey it.
[time=2667] It's impossible to obey what you don't know, isn't it?
[time=2672] We must be men and women who first observe God's word, who study it, who meditate it, who memorize major key passages of it.
[time=2682] And then the result is that we'll know it so that we can obey it.
[time=2687] Ignorance is the human nature's way of excusing ourselves for disobedience.
[time=2692] But prof, I didn't realize that you wanted the project done today.
[time=2697] Officer, I didn't realize that this zone wasn't 55 miles an hour. I didn't know.
[time=2704] My son at age three is a master of the excuse. I didn't know.
[time=2710] Whenever he is playing with friends and with cousins, nothing takes precedence over playtime, including certain biological needs.
[time=2720] He can't possibly interrupt himself to come back into the house.
[time=2725] On the 4th of July, he was with about ten cousins.
[time=2730] He was in heaven and they were playing at a park immediately attached to grandma's house when this biological needs struck.
[time=2737] But it was too far from the swing set to the house, so he just stayed playing.
[time=2743] And when we went to get him, we noticed some unique spots in his clothing.
[time=2748] And as we were confronting him on this situation, he looked up at his mother and said, "But Mom, I didn't know grandma's house had a potty.
[time=2761] I really didn't know that." Now, Kathy and I went on a mission strip for two weeks and he stayed in that house.
[time=2767] It must have been a long two weeks.
[time=2770] I didn't know ignorance.
[time=2775] I didn't know that was the law.
[time=2778] God, I didn't know your words said that.
[time=2782] May I, as a friend today, warn you that God will not accept ignorance as an excuse.
[time=2787] He not only tells us where to obey his word, he tells us where to observe it, we are to know what it says.
[time=2794] And the tragedy of our nation today is this.
[time=2798] We are biblically illiterate.
[time=2803] One man said to his fellow worker in a factory, "You don't know anything about the Bible.
[time=2808] You don't know the simplest thing. You don't even know the Lord's prayer." The man said, "I do too.
[time=2814] Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep." The man said, "Well, I guess you do know more about the Bible than I thought you did."
[time=2825] You know, we would know that that's not in the Bible.
[time=2827] But you know that most people think that early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
[time=2832] They think that's Bible. That's poor Richard's Almanac.
[time=2835] That's not King David. That's Ben Franklin.
[time=2838] And we just get these vague notions and we say, "We're biblically illiterate."
[time=2846] And not only are we biblically illiterate, we are biblically disobedient.
[time=2852] Most of this great country of ours has no idea what God's word has to say about morality.
[time=2858] They have no idea what God's word has to say about abortion.
[time=2862] They have no idea what God's word has to say about a responsibility financially.
[time=2867] We have no idea what it means in God's word when it talks about the death of Jesus Christ for our sins.
[time=2875] But there's a second tragedy.
[time=2877] Is those of us who do know what the Bible teaches are just as disobedient as those who do not?
[time=2888] We can sing America. God bless America.
[time=2894] But He's telling us in His word that God only blesses those people who honor Him.
[time=2901] If we honor God, He will honor us. If we dishonor God, He will dishonor us.
[time=2908] That principle is not only found in the book of Deuteronomy as it was a promise to Israel, but it was a general proverbial statement that Solomon declared.
[time=2916] Righteousness, exaltination. That means righteousness builds up a nation and sin as a reproach to any people.
[time=2926] David said blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.
[time=2932] We've got to do more than sing God bless America.
[time=2936] We've got to obey God so that the result will be He will bless us, for He will not.
[time=2945] That's verse one. It gives to us that principle.
[time=2948] Verses two through five give to us the proving of that principle.
[time=2954] It says thou shalt remember.
[time=2957] May I put in a plug for old history majors, it is good to learn history.
[time=2963] That's what Moses is doing here. He's saying let's take a course in contemporary Hebrew history.
[time=2969] Remember your fathers? Remember them that God led them all the way through the wilderness these forty years.
[time=2978] They came to Katie Sparnia, but God couldn't let them to go in, but do you remember what God did?
[time=2984] God took them through the wilderness and He was humbling them.
[time=2988] He wanted to take them in the land and exalt them, but instead He humbled them.
[time=2993] Why? Because they were disobedient and He not only humbled them, but He proved them, or He tested them to know what was in my heart.
[time=3001] God says before I'll ever take this nation into that land.
[time=3004] I will humble them and I'll prove them and I'll make sure that they're prepared when they come to that crossroads again to obey.
[time=3012] He proved them to know what was in their heart, whether they would keep us commandment or not.
[time=3018] And in that humbling, verse three, He suffered them to go hungry, but then He fed them.
[time=3025] And He allowed them to go thirsty, but then He fed them with water that came out of a rock.
[time=3032] And He did all of that. Why? So that they might know this statement, verse three,
[time=3039] "That man does not live by bread only, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the man live, the mouth of the Lord, death man live."
[time=3048] Does that sound familiar? Have you heard those words before and maybe never been in Deuteronomy chapter eight?
[time=3054] Those are the words that Jesus said in response to Satan's temptation.
[time=3059] This is the context that Jesus took them from.
[time=3062] And the whole point of this is that until a people learn spiritual priorities, they'll never know spiritual blessing.
[time=3070] Here was a nation that God said, "I blessed you and you disobeyed. Therefore, I will take away that blessing and you will go hungry."
[time=3078] And when you're hungry, then you'll know that you need God.
[time=3081] And then God fed them. He fed them with manna, a rare commodity never found.
[time=3088] They didn't know what it was. Neither did their fathers when they saw it.
[time=3091] Couldn't be natural logically explained away. It was the provision of God.
[time=3095] Not only that, look at verse four. It says, "Their arraignment grew not old upon thee." Fashion designers cry when they read that verse.
[time=3102] Here are a group of people that their shoes didn't even wear out.
[time=3106] 40 years in the wilderness, look at your shoes today.
[time=3109] With those last 40 years of walking in the wilderness, God uniquely provided sustaining grace for their physical needs.
[time=3117] Not only that, it said their feet didn't swell.
[time=3121] God took care of their bodies so that while their bodies were going through a time of great demand, their body could rise to the occasion.
[time=3128] He took care of their every need.
[time=3131] He says, "Remember? Do you remember that God, although He took us back into the wilderness, do you remember that He proved us?
[time=3141] And when we obey them, He provided and based upon that history lesson, He draws a conclusion."
[time=3149] Verse six, the word therefore, that is a concluding conjunction.
[time=3153] It says, "Based upon what you've heard before, the logical conclusion is this.
[time=3159] Therefore, thou shall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways and to fear Him."
[time=3167] Now, we often talk on a corporate level, and we talk about nations, but you know it's true individually, that God honors the man, God honors the woman who honors Him.
[time=3179] What we often think is that prosperity is the result of productivity, and that is only part of the formula.
[time=3191] The formula is this, that productivity plus obedience yields prosperity.
[time=3201] You can't just say, "God, I'll obey you," and forget about work on Monday morning, you have to be productive.
[time=3206] But you can't say, "God, I'll forget about you, and I'll go to work." If you'll know true fulfillment in your life, it'll come through obedience to God.
[time=3216] That's the conclusion of this history lesson, Moses said.
[time=3220] We're standing at the crossroads, we're ready to go in, and the choice of yours will you obey God, and with courage move forward, or will you say, "It's easier to do it my way.
[time=3231] I'll do my own thing." Now, Moses anticipated that they indeed would go into the land, and so he changes from preparation to go into the land now to a word of warning.
[time=3245] Once they're in the land in verse 10, because of the brevity of time, I just want to steal a few phrases from the rest of this chapter.
[time=3255] Once you're in the land, he says verse 10, "And everything's going great," verse 11, "beware that you forget the Lord your God, and you stop keeping His commandments."
[time=3272] I don't know how many of you I've had the privilege of talking to at a crossroads in your life.
[time=3277] Some of you major disasters have struck your family because you were disobedient.
[time=3282] And you came back to Christ, and you said, "God, I'll obey you," and you began to obey God, and almost immediately you saw God working in your life.
[time=3290] And you kept obeying God, and you saw Him bring about a great forgiveness and healing in your life, and you're now walking with the Lord, and you're obeying His Word, and then you're on top again.
[time=3301] You know what happens when you're on top? You forget. We forget the Lord.
[time=3307] He was saying here, "Don't forget." Jump down to verse 14, "When you forget, here's what happened."
[time=3313] Then your heart is lifted up, pride, and you forget the Lord who brought the out of Egypt.
[time=3323] What happens is prosperity often follows up with pride, that we get lifted up.
[time=3333] We say, "Well, look at all that I've done. Look at all the influence I wield. Look at the control I have. Look at how prominent I am.
[time=3342] Look at all my possessions," pride. Verse 17, this key phrase, "You forget the Lord and say in your heart, my strength, my hand, my smarts.
[time=3360] When I was shrewd, I made the deal. I knew where to get in on the ground level," pride. Learn this lesson from history.
[time=3371] That prosperity often leads to pride, and pride often leads to permissiveness.
[time=3378] Once we said, "This is mine, I've done all of it," then we begin to see ourselves as the king of our own little hell.
[time=3384] And as the king, we make all the governing decisions. You don't have to be a great historian to follow the trail.
[time=3392] It happened in Egypt, then it happened in Greece, then it happened in Rome. They became a prosperous nation.
[time=3400] They became prosperous because they followed the military tradition of duty and discipline.
[time=3407] But once they conquered their known worlds, they became proud. And when they became proud, they began to worship their own country and they worshiped their own government.
[time=3419] And they thought that they had done it all, and so they rewarded themselves with excesses of pleasure.
[time=3426] We talked last week about the Romans and their excesses of eating. They were excessive sexually and homosexual. And when they gave themselves to every excess, they fell.
[time=3439] Prosperity, pride, permissiveness. That's what happens when a nation forgets.
[time=3449] That's what happened when a family forgets. That's what happened when a mother forgets.
[time=3455] That's what happens when a father forgets. But there's that simple formula. If you will obey me, you will live.
[time=3467] And this chapter concludes with these harsh words. If you forget me, you will perish.
[time=3474] That's true both eternally and personally. Eternal life comes from knowing Christ, you know personally.
[time=3484] You've been listening to the special music by our musicians and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3492] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3497] Before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3502] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3510] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and forgive me.
[time=3515] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3522] If you've made a decision today, will you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3527] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
