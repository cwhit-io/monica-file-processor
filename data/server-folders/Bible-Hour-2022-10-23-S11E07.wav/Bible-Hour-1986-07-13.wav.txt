[time=90] Out of the pages of American history comes this familiar quote, "Remember the Alamo," and with that, Texans were stirred in their allegiance to their native state.
[time=118] "Remembering the rekindling of allegiance is so important." That's why Jesus said, "This do in remembrance of me."
[time=134] Good morning, and welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=140] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of this Lord's Day with us.
[time=145] Today, Pastor Rick's message is taken from 1 Corinthians, chapter 11, and is entitled "In Remembrance of Me."
[time=152] Remembering the rekindling of allegiance will be Rick's topic today on the Bible hour.
[time=158] It is important to note that remembering is the reason for holidays, such as the 4th of July and Memorial Day.
[time=165] That is also why those of us who are married wear wedding rings.
[time=170] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians, chapter 11.
[time=177] We will be looking at verses 23 through 33.
[time=181] Special music for today's service will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir, singing a song from their new album entitled "We Shall See Him As He Is."
[time=192] Also, we'll be hearing from our own Ladies Ensemble, and Rick Halls.
[time=201] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=207] and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=210] It is our prayer that the Lord will speak to you through today's message.
[time=215] Now, let's join the congregation as we begin the regular worship service.
[time=221] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=274] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=278] What a majestic way today to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=285] For us to stand together and to sing "How Great Thou Art," and then to hear you, our choir respond intifnally, "How Great Thou Art." We've come today, and so often we look at church and we say, "Well, I hope I get something out of it."
[time=300] And we sincerely hope that you do, but let us never forget that more than coming today to get,
[time=306] we've come to give to God the very worship of our lives.
[time=310] And so we sing "How Great Thou Art." Thank you for being a part of this morning worship service, and we welcome you to the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and also welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=322] We're looking forward to the day that we not only worship God in this way, but when we see Him face to face, and then we will know even as we are known,
[time=332] the coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=334] Our choir now ministers to us in music as they sing a medley of songs that tell us that Jesus Christ is coming again.
[time=365] [MUSIC - 213 seconds]
[time=583] - Directing that song as I think about Paul,
[time=597] he said I'm in between.
[time=600] I'm anxious to be with my heavenly Father, but I have responsibilities yet to do here on Earth for the Lord.
[time=609] When you sing a song like that, you get anxious for the time when we'll see Jesus Christ face to face.
[time=615] However, before that time comes, let us continue to build our lives and keep it on the firm foundation that he's laid for us.
[time=623] We'll sing together the next hymn, and it is hymn number 601.
[time=628] Let us sing together hymn number 601, we'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=643] [MUSIC - 77 seconds]
[time=730] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=733] The theme has been on Jesus Christ and the saving power.
[time=736] The Lord sent his own Son to die on the cross for our salvation and the forgiveness of sins.
[time=742] Ladies Ensemble comes now to sing a song for you that's entitled, "No Other Name But Jesus."
[time=749] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=859] Well, today we're looking forward with great excitement to a very special church service coming up in two weeks on July the 27th.
[time=871] Rick, we're going to be at the Grand Wayne Center downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=876] And just this week, I saw several of the people coming in to take their pictures for our new church directory.
[time=882] And I was excited about the fact that I'll have a little bit of time to kind of mingle with the people because of one service next week.
[time=889] That will be exciting.
[time=890] Here at Blackhog, every Sunday morning we have two worship services, but the Grand Wayne is so large that we can have all of our congregation in one service and also have room for you to come.
[time=902] If you've been watching the Bible Hour and call this your church home by way of television, I want to encourage you to join us in person for a great celebration of worship on July the 27th at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=918] Many of you have church homes and we do not want to entice you away from your church home, but if you're not worshiping somewhere in person and if you can physically able to get out, this is the Sunday to do that.
[time=929] We're going to have one worship service at 9.30 on Sunday morning, and we certainly want you to be there and to be a part of it.
[time=937] It was a great experience last year, wasn't it?
[time=939] Yes, just the atmosphere, the excitement of so many people being in one building at one time,
[time=945] and it was a great encouragement to us because of the number of people that do come through our doors and we appreciate all of our people and the faithfulness of them.
[time=954] Well, if you can possibly make it, we encourage you to do so on July the 27th at 9.30 in the morning
[time=961] for a very special service at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=964] I certainly hope that you can come and you can be a part of that worship service with us.
[time=969] Today, we want to encourage you to write for a great pamphlet on a very important and contemporary issue,
[time=976] and that is the issue of speaking in tongues.
[time=979] For some of you, that may be a concern for others of you.
[time=983] Perhaps you're not really familiar with the whole subject.
[time=986] In biblical times, the apostles had a unique ability, and so did the early Christians to speak in a language that they had never studied, that they had never learned in their life, and suddenly on the day of Pentecost, when Jewish people from around the world gathered, they suddenly heard the apostles teaching them about Christ in their native tongue, people who had never learned Latin were speaking Latin so that those who knew Latin could hear,
[time=1013] men who never learned Greek were speaking Greek so that the Greeks could hear.
[time=1017] Arabs were hearing in Arabic, Gentiles were hearing in their native tongue.
[time=1022] It was truly a miracle that God used to give out the gospel and as a sign to show that this message came from heaven and not simply from men.
[time=1032] Well, that was almost 2,000 years ago, and the question that lingers is this, does God still today give the gifts of speaking in tongues?
[time=1042] In the next few weeks on the Bible hour, we'll be approaching chapters 12, 13, and 14 of 1 Corinthians where it talks about spiritual gifts, and in particular this gift of tongues.
[time=1053] To help you to better understand what God's word has to say, we have a helpful little booklet entitled with one word, tongues, and it comes from the pen in the heart of Charles Swindall.
[time=1064] We'd love to send you a copy and want to encourage you to write for it today, we would be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1071] When writing for the booklet, tongues write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1080] That's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1088] I'm sure you've probably heard me say it before, that Charles Swindall is one of my favorite, if not my very most favorite, Bible communicator.
[time=1097] His preaching and his writing is deep and thorough, but yet it's always practical and wins him.
[time=1103] And this booklet carries all of those descriptions.
[time=1107] It'll be a great way for you to grow in the Word and to be able to study and not simply go upon your experience or mine or one person's opinion, but on clear teaching from God's Word.
[time=1119] I do hope that you'll write for that today.
[time=1121] Then finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to join us each Thursday night at 7 o'clock for the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1131] We just had our former pastor, David Jeremiah, two weeks ago, and then last week, Steve Green.
[time=1137] This week we'll be having by way of film, Dr. James Dobson, and a very excellent film series.
[time=1143] Yes, we've had several of the films already, Rick, and the title of the entire series is Turn Your Heart Towards Home, and this will be in another in the series and excellent films on the family.
[time=1154] They certainly are.
[time=1155] So if you're free on Thursdays at 7 o'clock, join us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1159] We're located at 7321 East State Boulevard.
[time=1163] We'd love to have you here.
[time=1165] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1173] [MUSIC] All of my life has been a struggle [MUSIC] Throw in my faith against the wind [MUSIC]
[time=1193] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=1203] [MUSIC] I need your love now to guide me [MUSIC] Now when you show me the way [MUSIC] With my life in your hands [MUSIC] I can walk with a held high [MUSIC] It's a feeling I dreamed of forever [MUSIC] With my life in your hands [MUSIC] Every day is simplified [MUSIC] 'Cause I need it in my life [MUSIC]
[time=1254] [MUSIC]
[time=1261] Why did I let this get so crazy, Lord [MUSIC] Trying on my own [MUSIC] 'Til you came along [MUSIC] How can I ever try to thank you, Lord [MUSIC] For being there [MUSIC] When nobody came [MUSIC] I need your love now to guide me [MUSIC] Now when you show me the way [MUSIC] With my life in your hands [MUSIC] I can walk with a held high [MUSIC] It's a feeling I dreamed of forever [MUSIC] With my life in your hands [MUSIC] Every day is simplified [MUSIC] 'Cause I need it in my life [MUSIC]
[time=1338] [MUSIC - 42 seconds]
[time=1390] God, we thank you for your hands.
[time=1404] It was gentle hands of love that hold the heart of that one that is breaking because of the lost of a loved one.
[time=1414] God, without us much enthusiasm, we thank you for those hands that discipline and draw us back when we, as we're so prone to do, stray.
[time=1427] But God, thank you for your gentle hands.
[time=1430] Yet your firm, strengthening hands as well.
[time=1434] May your hand be upon each of us.
[time=1437] God, we pray today that your hand would be on those who are going through some difficult days in the lives of their family and their loved ones.
[time=1447] We pray for those who are battling cancer, like Harry Blossard and Stephanie Ewing and Golden Miller and others.
[time=1456] God, we pray for those whose hearts are literally weak, like Doris Richards, Barney Ferris.
[time=1466] Ray Eichenauer.
[time=1469] God, we pray that you would give wisdom to their physicians and doctors to treat them.
[time=1475] We pray today, particularly for Nick Jarrus, as he is in a critical time of his health, that you would give the doctor's wisdom to diagnose the infection that he has.
[time=1487] We'd pray today, particularly for numbers of people who have lost loved ones,
[time=1494] some so tragically, for Nina Chenoweth, for Essie York and Sandy Priest.
[time=1503] God, for these women who now face life without their partners, we pray that you would give them a deep sense that you're present and you're their partner and that you will strengthen them.
[time=1515] God, today, we pray for men and myself that you would turn our hearts towards home,
[time=1523] that you would give us as men a desire to be a godly father and a godly husband.
[time=1529] Give us such a commitment that we'll seek out books and films and seminars
[time=1535] and workshops to be able to do that.
[time=1539] God, we pray today that you would give women a heart for their home and for their family as well.
[time=1546] God, we pray today, particularly for those families that have been fractured when spouse has become angry with their partner, that you might bring healing and strengthen those where rebellion is still destroying them.
[time=1560] God, today, through your word, we would pray that you would build each of us up.
[time=1565] As we've come to worship you, God, we want to know your word and to know your will, so I want to step back now and invite you to teach.
[time=1574] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1578] Well, it's been a great summer, hasn't it, celebrating 210 years of American history
[time=1585] and particularly celebrating the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty, which so graphically holds in front of us the visions of liberty and the pursuit of happiness that we are so privileged to have in our country.
[time=1601] Life magazine carried an excellent series of articles about the Statue of Liberty.
[time=1606] I've never had the privilege of seeing it, except for by television or film, but here are some of the statistics that helped me to picture how grand a lady she is.
[time=1617] The statue is 151 feet high, but for me, that's still hard to picture exactly what she looks like,
[time=1626] but then when they gave her nose length, I can picture that.
[time=1630] Try to imagine, if you can, a nose that is four foot six inches long when she catches a cold, it's a national epidemic.
[time=1639] The finger that's extended is nearly eight feet inches long.
[time=1644] She weighs 250 tons with a 35 foot waist and over two million of us go to see her each year.
[time=1653] When I see the pictures of the Statue of Liberty, I have to admit it does something to me,
[time=1659] and I hope that it does to you by way of kindling some flames of patriotism.
[time=1665] It's very easy for me when I see that to suddenly be caught in an aurora of feelings about this great country that God has privileged us to have.
[time=1675] It's good to remember.
[time=1677] Two weeks ago, we as a church celebrated hosting a patriotic panorama.
[time=1682] We've done this every year during the panorama.
[time=1686] The songs are sung that represent the four branches of the military.
[time=1690] We sing about those quasons that go rolling along and up and flying with the Air Force.
[time=1696] We sing about the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.
[time=1700] And then in this large congregation, the men and women who served in those branches of the government military stand, and I have to tell you, that gets to my heart.
[time=1712] Gratitude and remembering.
[time=1715] Isn't it good to remember?
[time=1718] Remembering rekindles the flames of allegiance.
[time=1723] And that's why Jesus said to his disciples, "Holding a piece of bread in a cup.
[time=1731] This do in remembrance of me." And as we celebrate that in our church services, we're remembering and it rekindles the flames of allegiance.
[time=1743] Open your Bible, if you will, to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and in verse 23, we continue our study through the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=1751] Allow me to read it for you.
[time=1754] For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you,
[time=1760] that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
[time=1766] and when he had given thanks, he'd break it and said, "Take, eat.
[time=1773] This is my body which is broken for you.
[time=1776] This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also, he took the cup.
[time=1785] When he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the New Testament in my blood.
[time=1792] This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me."
[time=1799] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[time=1805] ye do show the Lord's death till he come.
[time=1810] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[time=1817] unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[time=1824] But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.
[time=1831] For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,
[time=1838] not discerning the Lord's body.
[time=1842] For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep.
[time=1851] For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
[time=1856] But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world.
[time=1867] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, teary for one another.
[time=1875] God has written to the church not only of Corinth but be it the Church of Blackhawk or the Church of Akron, Ohio or Florida or South America about a commitment to remember.
[time=1890] A commitment to remember.
[time=1893] Sometimes in our overuse of the same words and our frequency of the same functions and habits,
[time=1900] we begin to lose sight of their real significance in their meeting.
[time=1906] Actually, what does the word communion mean?
[time=1909] What does the word eucharist mean?
[time=1911] What does the cup mean and the bread mean?
[time=1914] And why on earth are we still doing it 2,000 years later?
[time=1918] It's to rekindle allegiance and devotion.
[time=1923] To keep the flames burning, to keep them hot.
[time=1927] Those of you who are married, look at your left hand for a moment.
[time=1930] Would you do that?
[time=1931] You probably notice a ring that is right there.
[time=1933] I have this ring and that's a reminder.
[time=1937] It reminds me of obviously the fact that I'm married.
[time=1941] But just looking at that ring conjures up all kinds of things in my mind.
[time=1946] I remember the day Kathy and I went to pick out rings.
[time=1949] We wrote a new definition on the word poor.
[time=1952] I was a seminary student.
[time=1955] She had worked for the last year, lived at home and saved up $44.
[time=1963] Might not have been that much, but it was right around $40.
[time=1967] And so with my expenses as a seminary student and her dowry of $44,
[time=1973] on the same day we went out to buy her ring and my ring.
[time=1977] We went out to rent an apartment and to put down a security deposit to hold that in the first month's rent and to pay one semester's tuition at graduate school.
[time=1989] I remember then going to the bank and taking out the loan for this ring.
[time=1994] I remember that day.
[time=1997] I remember the day at the Chaplain University Park where she said I do.
[time=2002] I wasn't sure she was going to say it, but she did.
[time=2005] I remember her taking this ring and sliding it on to this finger half way.
[time=2011] It's really hard to put a ring on somebody else's hand, isn't it, when it's swollen with sweat and fear.
[time=2017] She pushed that ring half way on and then said, with this ring, "I thee wed."
[time=2025] I remember that.
[time=2028] Remembering rekindles the flames of allegiance.
[time=2034] That's why Jesus said, "This do in remembrance of me."
[time=2040] Paul said, "I'm delivering unto you first that which I've also received." He's saying, "I've gotten this from the Lord and now I'm passionate unto you.
[time=2048] This is coming straight from the top." He says, "On the night in which he was betrayed, betrayed." That gives us historical context.
[time=2057] It's found back in Matthew chapter 26.
[time=2060] Put your church bulletin in there and flip back to Matthew 26 just for a moment because this is a significant event.
[time=2069] Verse 17 says, "And on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him, "Where will thou that we prepare for thee the Passover?" And he said, "Go unto a city to such a man and say unto him, the master sayeth, my time is at hand.
[time=2087] I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples." And the disciples did just as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the Passover.
[time=2098] Now down in verse 26.
[time=2100] And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them.
[time=2105] His disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is my body." And he took the cup and gave thanks and he gave it to them saying, "Drink the of it, for this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remissions of sin." Allow me to set the historical context.
[time=2125] They are gathering for a feast, the feast of unleavened bread, and particularly the celebration of the Passover.
[time=2133] This was a Jewish holiday of great significance.
[time=2140] It was the celebration of the bondage in Egypt and more particularly the Passover and the deliverance out of Egypt.
[time=2150] To boil it down simply at this Passover feast, they were celebrating their deliverance out of Egypt, where God sent successive plagues upon Egypt to persuade Pharaoh
[time=2163] to let the people of Israel emigrate out of bondage into the Promised Land.
[time=2168] As you probably recall, Pharaoh's heart was hard and refused and the plagues culminated with the tenth one, the death of the firstborn.
[time=2177] God told Moses, Moses told Israel and Pharaoh that the angel of death is going to Passover and the firstborn of both livestock and each family will die.
[time=2191] God then told Israel that they were to sacrifice and lamb and then to take a sampling of the blood of that lamb and to mark the doorpost of their house.
[time=2201] And when the angel of death would come over Egypt, killing the firstborn, it would spare the firstborn of each house that was so marked.
[time=2211] And that's exactly what happened.
[time=2214] And now a nation is called together to remember.
[time=2219] And as they celebrate, there were three things that were particular in that celebration.
[time=2224] First of all, they ate unleavened bread.
[time=2226] That's why it was called the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[time=2230] That unleavened bread was symbolic of a number of things.
[time=2234] First of all, leaven was symbolic of sin in the Bible as leaven in a lump will grow and expand so sin will grow and expand
[time=2243] unless it is purged out.
[time=2245] But it was also a night they were told not to have an eleven in their home and when they fled from Egypt, they had no eleven.
[time=2253] They had no bread, no way of reproducing.
[time=2255] And they were totally dependent upon God for food.
[time=2259] Secondly, they had a cup.
[time=2262] It was a cup of wine.
[time=2264] But added to this familiar tasting wine would be some bitter herbs.
[time=2269] It's called Nutrisweet and they would put it right in there.
[time=2273] And that was to give that familiar tasting wine an uncharacteristic bitter taste.
[time=2280] And that was to remind them of the bitterness of slavery in Egypt.
[time=2286] And so as they would drink that, at first there would be the familiar aroma of the grape.
[time=2292] But then there would be the bitter afterbite of the herb and they would remember the bitterness of slavery.
[time=2299] And then there would be the animal that was sacrificed to lamb and selected portions of that would be prepared and would be eaten.
[time=2308] Now this whole ceremony was rich in tradition and significant in meaning.
[time=2315] But it's now thirteen hundred years old.
[time=2318] And some very exact procedures had developed.
[time=2322] The head of the house or the leader of the assembly in these disciples would gather, no doubt Jesus would lead it.
[time=2329] They would take the bread and with the giving of the bread would be given the explanation of the meaning of the eleven meaning of the herbs that would be coming in the cup.
[time=2340] There would be a recitation of history as they would recite the Passover and the crossing of the Red Sea and the journey into the promised land.
[time=2351] Then there would be the reading of Psalms 113 through 118.
[time=2356] And year after year after year after year these same things were repeated again and again and again so that a nation can remember.
[time=2366] No doubt some of the young people in a large family would almost not off to sleep as they heard the same thing year after year.
[time=2376] And suddenly Jesus changes all of that.
[time=2382] Picture Peter who's always impulsive, kind of sitting there with his arms crossed half day dreaming, almost mimicking with Jesus.
[time=2390] And this bread shows us the unleavened out of Egypt.
[time=2395] And Jesus doesn't say that.
[time=2397] He says this bread is my body.
[time=2401] Did he forget the script?
[time=2405] He holds up the cup and they're expecting him to say this cup represents the bitterness of slavery and he doesn't.
[time=2412] He said this cup is a new agreement.
[time=2417] It's my blood shed for you.
[time=2421] That woke him up.
[time=2424] You see he was instituting a whole new relationship with God.
[time=2432] He took something that was old and he transformed it into something that was totally different and new.
[time=2438] When we hear the words testament, we think of Old Testament, that's 39 books, right?
[time=2443] New Testament, that's 27.
[time=2445] And the word testament means a collection of books.
[time=2448] It's not what it means at all.
[time=2450] It's like a last will on testament.
[time=2452] A testament is an agreement, a definitive statement.
[time=2456] The Old Testament word would be covenant.
[time=2459] The Old Testament refers not to 39 books as much to a whole agreement that God had with humanity and he said this is how you all approach me.
[time=2471] And Jesus changes all of that and says it's all changed now.
[time=2475] This is how you all approach God.
[time=2478] That was radical stuff.
[time=2480] That was revolutionary.
[time=2483] He didn't say this bread, unleavened, Egypt.
[time=2488] This cup, bitter, slavery, he said this bread is my body.
[time=2493] By that he was referring to that he, God became incarnate.
[time=2498] That God put on flesh and that his body was being given for them.
[time=2505] And he said this blood, this cup is my blood and it's given for you.
[time=2514] Allow me to make two points that at least I feel are significant at this point.
[time=2520] When Jesus said this is my body and this is my blood, there are those of us who try to take that too literally.
[time=2527] That at some point mystically it becomes the body of Christ or it becomes the blood of Christ.
[time=2532] Because after all Jesus said this is my body, this is my blood.
[time=2537] Well that is simply a figure of speech.
[time=2541] My wife connived a picture of me from my mother from when I was a little guy last week.
[time=2549] Even though when I was three years old and she puts that next to Adam and says, boy look at those.
[time=2555] How much they look alike.
[time=2557] And then someone says he's a chip off the old block.
[time=2560] Let me make two points.
[time=2562] One Adam's not a chip and two I'm not an old block.
[time=2568] What's that?
[time=2569] That's a figure of speech.
[time=2570] You're not saying Adam's a chip and I hope you're not saying I'm an old block.
[time=2573] Some of you are saying well you know if the shoe fits.
[time=2576] That's a figure of speech.
[time=2579] It's saying that these two guys look alike.
[time=2583] Jesus was saying this bread, it now represents my body.
[time=2588] This cup it now represents my blood.
[time=2591] And the proof of that is when Jesus said it he was still in his body.
[time=2596] It wasn't a post resurrection, post ascension.
[time=2599] He was in his body.
[time=2601] It was just symbolic but very significant.
[time=2604] The second thing is just a little bit of insight into one little word found in verse 25.
[time=2611] He said this cup is the New Testament in my blood.
[time=2616] The English word in is the Greek word in.
[time=2619] Only they spelled epsilon nu or en.
[time=2623] But that word has been showed by skillful scholars who weren't trying to prove anything.
[time=2628] They were just showing what it means to mean something that was not simply in my blood but at the cost of my blood.
[time=2637] Let me illustrate this by an air I made.
[time=2640] Every month we do the same thing you do and that is we take all of the checks and we start paying the utility company for water and the electric company and all the different bills.
[time=2651] We do that by check.
[time=2653] At the bottom of the check you put your name.
[time=2657] When you put your name there they can then go to the bank and that check is cashed because it's in your name and it will be at the expense of your account.
[time=2667] Now the reason why I know all that is last month I filled out all the checks and forgot to sign one of them.
[time=2672] They had to send it back because it wasn't in my name and therefore could not be put to my expense.
[time=2679] And that's exactly what they're saying here Jesus said this is the new agreement and it's in my blood.
[time=2685] It's at the expense of my name and the payment is my blood.
[time=2690] You see the Bible says without the shedding of blood there is no remission there is no forgiveness of sins.
[time=2697] The wages of sin is death.
[time=2701] Ezekiel said the soul that sins it shall die.
[time=2705] And Jesus said the only way you'll ever have access to God is at my expense through my blood.
[time=2714] There are those of you who like to study theology and use precise terms.
[time=2719] We call that the substitutionary atonement.
[time=2723] That simply means Jesus atoned he paid for our sins covering God's anger at sin and washing it away and he did that as a substitute for me.
[time=2734] He did it for me.
[time=2740] In the early days of American history if you were drafted and you didn't want to go to war then you could hire someone to take your place as a substitute.
[time=2749] Jesus said the wages of sin is death I will go as your substitute.
[time=2758] Then he said this do in remembrance of me.
[time=2763] You take this bread and you eat it.
[time=2765] You take this cup as you drink it.
[time=2768] Why in remembrance of me?
[time=2773] And I believe the church is to be doing it repeatedly again and again and again and again because it says as often as you eat, as often as you drink, implying that the church goes through this as a part of a very meaningful tradition.
[time=2787] Now what's the significance of it?
[time=2790] I think the Bible is teaching us there are five reasons why it is so important to remember.
[time=2799] First of all communion is important because it reminds us of the death of Christ.
[time=2805] It reminds us that he died for our sins and that sin has a high price and yet God loved us enough to pay that high price.
[time=2814] You've probably seen the signs also.
[time=2817] You're in a store and in one particular section the store are all the nice things that are very expensive and very fragile.
[time=2824] The sign often reads like this pretty to look at pretty to hold.
[time=2830] If you break them they are sold.
[time=2834] I want to tell you as the father of three little children I avoid those stores greatly.
[time=2839] It's not the place to take little boys and girls who like to touch things but don't recognize their value.
[time=2847] It's not the type of place to take a barbarian like me either but we try to stay out of those because they're expensive.
[time=2855] They're very expensive.
[time=2858] They cost a lot.
[time=2860] And when we take communion it's to remind us that sin is expensive.
[time=2866] The payment for sin is not just loose change.
[time=2870] The payment for sin is that Jesus Christ had to die and that sin cost God his son.
[time=2877] And we're to remember that.
[time=2880] It should rekindle some flames of allegiance.
[time=2885] Secondly communion is to remind us of exactly that word that our communion with Christ.
[time=2893] Whenever you hear the word communion you probably do the same thing I do.
[time=2896] You think of white linen over this communion table and bread and cup and ushers and deacons.
[time=2903] The word communion has a meaning apart from that.
[time=2906] It's actually a compound of two words come which means with or together and union which really means the same thing to be together.
[time=2914] And communion is simply saying our common union with Christ.
[time=2919] God gave us two neat promises.
[time=2921] The first ones do us individually.
[time=2923] He said I'll never leave you nor forsake you Hebrews 13 5.
[time=2927] I don't know what deep valley you may have gone through this week and I know many of you have gone through some tough ones.
[time=2934] Christ promises that he'll go with you.
[time=2937] Some of you have sword with the wings of eagles and you're on top of the world and Christ said I'm right there with you.
[time=2944] Some of you have gone through chronic battles with your health again and again, he promises I'll go with you.
[time=2951] Many in this congregation have lost loved ones in last days.
[time=2956] God says I'll go with you.
[time=2958] And when we take that little piece of bread we say this is his body.
[time=2963] We take that cup we say this is his blood and it visualizes for us physically the spiritual truth that he's with me.
[time=2973] But there's a second promise given to all of us that Jesus said where two or three are gathered my name.
[time=2981] There I am in the midst of them.
[time=2984] He's with us as we meet today.
[time=2987] Perhaps we should have a chair that is physically unoccupied just to visualize for us that he is here.
[time=2995] That he is present in our worship and he is always with us.
[time=3000] And as we come to that communion table that's not the moment he's with us.
[time=3003] He's always with us but it visualizes that truth.
[time=3007] Thirdly communion also represents to us and reminds us of the communion of the saints.
[time=3014] That's a phrase out of church history that simply means that we're in this together.
[time=3018] Another word is fellowship.
[time=3021] Paul was setting the stage for all this discussion in chapter 11 back in chapter 10 and look at verse 17 of chapter 10.
[time=3030] For we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread.
[time=3038] Verse 21 you cannot eat or you cannot drink of the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
[time=3044] You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of demons.
[time=3048] Now what he is saying back here is this that we are all many.
[time=3052] There's 500 of us here this hour.
[time=3055] There were more the last hour and there probably more that didn't come today but should have.
[time=3060] We're all one bread.
[time=3062] That's the bread that Jesus said I am the bread of life.
[time=3066] We are now his body.
[time=3067] We're in it together.
[time=3069] And we all take of that same bread and drink of that same cup to visualize that we are one.
[time=3077] Together in Christ.
[time=3080] That we're united and in the next chapter he'll extend that analogy that metaphor even further.
[time=3087] And communion is to remind me that I'm vitally linked and dependent on you and you to me and we're in it together.
[time=3095] Fourthly communion is to remind us to celebrate salvation.
[time=3100] That's what this whole thing is about.
[time=3102] He said I declare it unto you.
[time=3105] I announce it.
[time=3106] I shout it.
[time=3107] Salvation.
[time=3108] A new testament.
[time=3110] All this whole Old Testament with its ceremonies and its traditions, its sacrifices, its altars, its feasts, its obligation.
[time=3118] It's gone.
[time=3119] It is done.
[time=3120] It is over with and there's a whole new agreement free by the grace of God.
[time=3127] Let's celebrate.
[time=3130] And finally communion is to tell us and remind us that he is coming again.
[time=3138] Verse 26 is for as oft as you drink this cup.
[time=3143] You do show the Lord's death till he come.
[time=3148] Jesus is coming again.
[time=3153] You know the song may be morning, may be noon.
[time=3156] It may be evening, it may be soon.
[time=3159] Oh what a wonderful day that will be.
[time=3162] Jesus is coming again.
[time=3165] We live with such prosperity and such ease that the second coming of Christ is certainly something we're looking forward to because we can't believe somebody's going to outdo Steven Spielberg.
[time=3176] But you know for the early church that meant deliverance.
[time=3181] That meant that there was going to be someone who would put Roman check and believers would no longer be fed to animals or burn on poles to illuminate Nero's party.
[time=3193] Jesus is coming again.
[time=3196] That meant that those who had been separated from their loved ones and banished like John would be reunited in heaven with Christ, he was coming.
[time=3207] And when they held that bread and they drank that cup they said God you've been faithful in performing the first half of your messianic promises of dying for our sins and this reminds us that you'll fulfill the second and come again and restore the world to your kingdom.
[time=3225] What a reminder that is.
[time=3228] Can you see how remembering rekindles the flames of devotion?
[time=3235] A group of Texans were fighting for their independence from Mexico.
[time=3240] They'd been beaten badly and often and they were about to give up.
[time=3245] Till one man led the charge with boldness with this shout.
[time=3249] Remember the Alamo.
[time=3252] And a group of men remembered a Davy Crockett and a Jim Bowie who would die for freedom and they would go and fight again.
[time=3259] Why? Because they remembered.
[time=3266] Beloved when we hold that cup and we taste that bread is to remind us and to rekindle flames of allegiance to Christ.
[time=3277] May the flames burn hot in our hearts.
[time=3282] If all of this is true then there needs to be some practical application.
[time=3286] Verse 27 begins with a little conjunction where for some translations therefore that is simply a word that says I'm now going to make some conclusions on what I've already said.
[time=3298] Let me give you three of those conclusions very quickly.
[time=3301] Conclusion number one, don't eat or drink from this table unworthily.
[time=3307] Beloved we're all unworthy. There's none of us who are worthy to take it but to be unworthy is defined in verse 29 is to not discerning the Lord's body.
[time=3316] By that it's saying not recognizing that this cup, this bread is representative of the Christ who died for me and if I'm going to take of it I've got to discern what it means and bring my life into harmony with that.
[time=3330] The second principle he gives us is this one, judge ourselves.
[time=3335] Examine ourselves. Before we take that, examine ourselves.
[time=3341] You know there's a popular trend in Christianity to say I know what God's word says and I sure don't like that.
[time=3347] So what I'll do is I'll go ahead and do what I want to do and then later I'll ask God to forgive me.
[time=3354] And then I'll be restored and then the next time I don't want to do what he says I'll do my own things and I'll just ask him to restore me.
[time=3362] We treat the blood of Christ as a cheap thing.
[time=3366] My family has been in the appliance business for a number of years and they have soap that's manufactured in their name.
[time=3373] My dad brings us whenever we needed a fifty pound tub of soap.
[time=3379] We treat that stuff pretty cheap. We use it in our washing machine.
[time=3384] We use it to wash the white wall tires of the car.
[time=3388] We use it to scrub the porch, the patio, the garage, the kids when they're that grimy.
[time=3394] Why? It's free, it's cheap and we just throw it around.
[time=3397] And that's exactly what many of us are doing with the blood of Christ.
[time=3401] We're saying it's free, it's cheap. I'll just do what I want and then I'll throw a little of the blood on Jesus on it.
[time=3406] Now you want to know what happens? He says for that reason some of you are weak.
[time=3411] That means you don't have any power in your life. Some of you are sick, physically literally sick and some of you died.
[time=3418] That's what the word "sleep" means.
[time=3420] It's saying that God will discipline us, he'll chasten us and if we're out of fellowship with him, he may weaken our life to try to draw us back.
[time=3427] If that doesn't work, he may make us sick and if that doesn't work, God may say you lose your privilege of serving me on earth.
[time=3435] I'm taking you out of there.
[time=3437] And we'll go to heaven because Christ paid for that but we'll lose the privilege of serving.
[time=3443] It says examine ourselves.
[time=3446] Let me emphasize two things.
[time=3449] It says here judge yourself, not your brother-in-law.
[time=3452] And for me that's a full-time job judging myself.
[time=3456] We don't judge anyone else.
[time=3460] And secondly, let me point out just because someone's sick, don't say aha, sin, gotcha.
[time=3467] It's exactly what they did to Job when they were wrong.
[time=3470] But some sickness and some death may be the very chastening of God.
[time=3475] The third principle is this, remember the potential of this judgment.
[time=3479] There's a play on words that will take a length of time to explain.
[time=3483] Let me just give it to you very quickly.
[time=3486] It says in verse 29 you eat and drink judgment.
[time=3489] The King James says condemnation, too harsh of a word.
[time=3494] Verse 32 it says God chases us, he judges so that we won't be condemned with the world.
[time=3500] God's saying in verse 29 he'll judge us, but he won't condemn us.
[time=3504] That's a word for judge.
[time=3506] And then in verse 32 the word is a compound of an intensive judgment which implies condemnation.
[time=3513] God's saying I'm going to discipline you in this life, judge you now.
[time=3518] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our church musicians and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3525] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3530] Before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3533] Will you pray with me?
[time=3535] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3542] And today I sent the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3546] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3551] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
