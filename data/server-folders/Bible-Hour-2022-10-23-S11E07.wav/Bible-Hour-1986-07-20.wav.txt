[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=112] There are those who say don't teach doctrine.
[time=115] Doctrine only divides.
[time=117] We should just all love one another.
[time=120] The tragedy of that thinking is that the absence of doctrinal teaching leads to spiritual ignorance.
[time=126] And yes, spiritual ignorance can lead to death.
[time=130] Ask those at Jonestown.
[time=133] (upbeat music) - Morning, and thank you for joining us for an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=144] This morning, Pastor Rick's text is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[time=149] The message he has entitled, "Spiritual Ignorance." Today's message is the first in a series from 1 Corinthians dealing with spiritual gifts.
[time=158] This could be the single most misunderstood and debated issue in Christianity today.
[time=164] Please have your Bible open to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, where we'll be looking at verses one through three.
[time=170] We encourage you to study along with us.
[time=174] Our special music for today is provided by a new mixed ensemble called "Celebration." An instrumental solo from Scott Schindler, and a vocal solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=189] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=197] We pray that the Lord will speak to you through today's message.
[time=201] Now let's join the congregation as we begin the regular worship service.
[time=205] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=268] Thank you, Rich, and you may be seated.
[time=281] This morning, it's our privilege to declare both in this auditorium and to our friends who join us for the Bible hour that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that He's given us the privilege of being born again into the family of God.
[time=295] Paul said, "Now is the acceptable time, behold, now is the day of salvation." I hope that you've come to the place in your life that you know Jesus Christ is Savior.
[time=305] Sometimes we often say, "Yes, I need to do that." But we put the time off.
[time=311] But the Bible says, "The time is now." A musical group in our church called "Celebration Sings of that Truth." That today you and I have the privilege of accepting Christ that, "Behold, now is the acceptable time.
[time=326] The time is now."
[time=329] [MUSIC]
[time=353] The time is now.
[time=362] Receive it all.
[time=365] And inheritance a favor from the King.
[time=370] His reward is when it's written in His hand.
[time=376] For all who reach to hold it is there.
[time=381] Hold this in every way.
[time=385] It's happening today.
[time=387] He's here to do what He came to do.
[time=391] If we allow Him to.
[time=393] He is the Savior, healer, delivery, deamer, counselor,
[time=401] delivery, fighter, Jesus, Messiah, now.
[time=416] The time is now.
[time=418] His love is here to work a total transformation in your soul,
[time=427] to swallow every care.
[time=430] His supply is there for strength to hold and power to be changed.
[time=438] He said the count is free, no fight for every need.
[time=444] He's here to give what He came to give.
[time=447] If we allow Him to.
[time=450] He is the Savior, healer, delivery, deamer, counselor,
[time=457] provider, Jesus, Messiah.
[time=462] He says, if you'll come to me, I'll run, not walk to you.
[time=467] Give me a heart that's faithful and watch what I will do.
[time=473] I'm able to accomplish it according to my words.
[time=479] You just wait on me and sing.
[time=483] He says, if you'll come to me, I'll run, not walk to you.
[time=487] I'll run, not walk to you.
[time=489] Give me a heart that's faithful and watch what I will do.
[time=493] That's what I will do.
[time=495] I'm able to accomplish it according to my words.
[time=500] You just wait on me and sing.
[time=505] The time is now to celebrate.
[time=510] And thank Him for His resurrection life.
[time=514] Oh, that He came to revive.
[time=518] Every dream had died.
[time=521] He said in motion, all that standing still.
[time=527] His mind is present.
[time=529] Oh, then just ask Him to begin.
[time=532] He's here to be what He came to be.
[time=536] Allow Him to.
[time=538] He is the Savior, our healer, deliver a redeemer.
[time=544] Counselor, reminder, Jesus, Messiah.
[time=550] Help her restore her, build a rewarder.
[time=556] The giver of life is here.
[time=559] We save Him now.
[time=572] Thank you, celebration.
[time=586] So many of the biblical truths and the heritage of our church have been put to music through the pen of the blind poetess, Fanny Crosby.
[time=594] And we're going to sing one of our hymns this morning.
[time=597] Him number 458, Draw Me Nearer, we'll sing verses 1, 2, and 4.
[time=601] Let's stand as we sing, please.
[time=617] I am by O Lord, I have heard my voice, said O'er I love to be.
[time=626] I love to rise to the arts of faith, and He hopes to come to be.
[time=634] Draw me Nearer, Nearer, let's go to the cross, and bow as sun.
[time=643] Draw me Nearer, Nearer, let's go on, to the rest of the sun.
[time=656] Come to great enough to bless her, bless her, and Lord of mercy,
[time=664] Lord, and the soul of God is here as one, and our will be lost in one.
[time=674] Draw me Nearer, Nearer, let's go on, to the rest of the sun.
[time=723] Draw me Nearer, Nearer, Nearer, let's go on, to thy precious being sun.
[time=743] Hello, once again.
[time=745] Pete Coby is not with us today, he is in Washington, D.C., helping the editors of a brand new Christian
[time=752] hymn book, but we're certainly thankful that you're with us today, that we can share together in music that honors the Lord Jesus Christ and a study of God's Word.
[time=762] I hope that today you have your Bible in your hand and your heart is open as well, so that we can study together from the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=771] Today I'd like to encourage those of you who do not have a church home and who can possibly come out and worship with us to join us next Sunday, July the 27th at 9.30 for a grand celebration
[time=785] at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=787] We're moving out of our facilities here at Blackhawk to the downtown Grand Wayne Center for a one Sunday morning service at 9.30.
[time=796] That allows us to do some maintenance work here in our auditorium and gives us a chance to bring our two services to one and still have room for you to come and join us.
[time=806] That service will be at 9.30 on Sunday morning and of course will be broadcast at 11 o'clock here in Fort Wayne on the Bible hour.
[time=814] We certainly hope that you can come and join us and we'll look forward to being together on July the 27th at 9.30.
[time=822] Today I would like to ask you to study with us as we begin a new topic on spiritual gifts
[time=828] and when we think of spiritual gifts perhaps the one that receives the most attention is the gift of tongues.
[time=836] Perhaps you've often wondered what the gift of tongues is.
[time=839] Is it for today and what does God's Word have to say?
[time=842] We have a helpful little booklet that we would love to send to you if you will simply write to us today.
[time=848] This book is written by Charles Swindall one of the greatest Bible teachers of all times and certainly of our time today.
[time=855] The booklet is a thorough Bible study, it's not simply one man's opinion but it is a study
[time=861] of God's Word.
[time=863] If you would like a copy of this booklet simply write to us today and request the booklet with the simple title "Tongs" we'll be sure and send you a copy.
[time=872] Our address is the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=893] We're asking you to write to us today for that booklet and we've written to many of you who are on our mailing list in recent days to tell you about a summer project that we're involved in.
[time=903] We certainly appreciate your support of the Bible hour not only in financial gifts but in prayer and in encouragement.
[time=911] A number of years ago we bought a new home, new to us, it was actually 20 years old and
[time=917] the roof leaked.
[time=919] Unfortunately because of that the inside of the house was damaged and we had a lot of repairs ahead of us.
[time=925] Our next door neighbor and close friends saw what happened and noticed that their roof was soon to need repair and the two of us jumped on the roof and spent a couple of Saturdays and re-roofed the whole house.
[time=936] He wisely chose to do it before the crisis came.
[time=940] That's why we're writing this letter to many of you before the crisis comes to ask for your help and your partnership financially.
[time=947] If you receive that letter I hope that you'll prayerfully consider what God wants you to do.
[time=952] If you haven't received it and would like a copy simply write to us and we'll make sure that you're included.
[time=959] Coming up this Thursday on our summer Bible Conference an old friend returns to Blackhawk.
[time=963] Dr. Ken Nichols was a part of our staff for a number of years and he's coming back to Fort Wayne for a special summer Bible Conference at 7 o'clock.
[time=973] Many of you will remember Ken because he spoke on the Bible hour once or twice and he was such an active part of this community.
[time=981] He'll be here at 7 o'clock on Thursday and we hope that you can come and be a part of that special event as well.
[time=988] Then coming up in just a few weeks on Sunday we have Johnny Hall with us on August the 10th.
[time=994] So this is an exciting summer.
[time=995] We're certainly thankful that we can share it with you.
[time=998] Please do write to us today so we can send you this great booklet entitled Tongues.
[time=1003] We'll look forward to hearing from you.
[time=1005] Once again our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1012] Thank you for joining us, God bless you.
[time=1025] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=1175] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1182] Thank you, Scott.
[time=1184] Oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[time=1186] Come, let us exalt His name together.
[time=1189] God, thank you for a piano that can command our attention.
[time=1193] That will draw our hearts to an image of a majestic God who loves us and who cares for us.
[time=1199] God, we've come today to celebrate, to declare that we love you and that you are our God.
[time=1206] We stand here with a confused emotion of humility and pride.
[time=1211] God, we are humbled today that we must admit that we need you.
[time=1216] We, in our own strength, confiding, striving is but losing.
[time=1222] But God, today we meet with the exaltation and the pride, not in ourselves, but in you, that you've redeemed us, that you've bought us with your Son, the Lord Jesus.
[time=1231] And God, we sense the invigorating power of your spirit surging within us.
[time=1237] God, today, we ask you to pour out your spirit on our lives, that we might be empowered to serve you.
[time=1244] We pray that you would give us a heart for service, that you would give us a desire to declare the name of Jesus with all boldness, with all truth, and with all grace.
[time=1257] Oh, God, today, we thank you for Christ Jesus and the promises of your word of eternal life.
[time=1264] We pray that today, in the hearts of those who've lost loved ones, that the promises of Christ
[time=1270] would swell up and form a rock of eternal hope.
[time=1275] We today pray for the families of Alice Flowers and Ken Richards of this church and the loss of their mother.
[time=1283] We pray for Mr. Richards and the loss of his partner of 58 years.
[time=1288] We pray today for the family of Stephanie Eure.
[time=1291] That as these who have lost loved ones walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[time=1297] that they might sense that you walk with them.
[time=1300] God, we pray today for those whose health is so critical, that you would give strength to their lives.
[time=1307] We particularly pray for Barney Ferris, that today we would give his doctors wisdom.
[time=1313] We pray today for Ray Eichenauer and for others whose hearts are weak, that you would cause them to grow strong.
[time=1320] God, we pray for our own lives, that our hearts would grow strong spiritually.
[time=1325] That as this world calls us with the woo of materialism, that we would find satisfaction in what we possess,
[time=1333] that we would discover that in Jesus Christ there is more, and all the riches this world can afford.
[time=1341] So today, God, we've come to worship you and to declare that we'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
[time=1348] that we would rather have Jesus than riches untold.
[time=1352] And we pray this morning, even as we hear a song, that it might become the song of our life, that we would want Jesus Christ more than anything.
[time=1360] For it is in his name that we pray, amen.
[time=1369] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold, I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[time=1398] I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[time=1410] I'd rather be led by his nail pierced hand than to be the king of a vast domain,
[time=1430] or beheld in sins, dread, sway.
[time=1440] I'd rather have Jesus than anything.
[time=1451] This world affords today.
[time=1461] I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause.
[time=1471] I'd rather be faithful to his dear cause.
[time=1480] I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
[time=1490] I'd rather be true to his holy name than to be the king of a vast domain,
[time=1510] or beheld in sins, dread, sway.
[time=1520] I'd rather have Jesus than anything.
[time=1532] This world affords today.
[time=1542] I'd rather have Jesus than anything.
[time=1556] This world affords today.
[time=1576] What is it that your heart wants today?
[time=1579] The quietness of a song, there is an opportunity to reflect.
[time=1584] What is it that my life is in pursuit of?
[time=1590] Is Jesus Christ really that which I possess and hold so dear that if I had to give up the treasures of my life,
[time=1598] that that would be the last one I would relinquish?
[time=1602] What have you built your life on today?
[time=1605] Have you built your life today on your success record as a businessman?
[time=1610] That you have proven to your family and to your friends that you are successful?
[time=1616] So you've built your life on a self-esteem that says, "I am successful." Have you built your life today on your relationships?
[time=1625] That you feel secure in that place that we call home that you've given your trust to people and you're secure?
[time=1634] What have you built your life on today?
[time=1637] Have you built your life today upon your financial resources?
[time=1641] That you've investigated economic trends and that you are able to prognosticate of the future
[time=1647] and you have saved enough aside that should difficult days come you would be secure?
[time=1653] You've built your life on that security.
[time=1657] Our view today discovered that there is no security that this world can afford that is greater than Jesus Christ.
[time=1666] I hope that you discover that there's one that changes not, who loves you.
[time=1672] And you're so intimate that he said, "I will come into your heart and live with you and you can live with me."
[time=1678] I love the way Marilyn sings, but that song is more than beautiful.
[time=1682] It's a message of life that I'd rather have Jesus than anything.
[time=1686] What is it you've searched for this week?
[time=1689] Some have searched for great experiences.
[time=1691] And they've discovered that in some esoteric experience of ecstasy, they found a new dimension of life.
[time=1699] I believe the life that we search for is found in the pages of God's Word, this scripture.
[time=1705] So I invite you to open today to the Bible, 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verses 1 through 3.
[time=1712] We'll constitute our study, not just this Sunday, but for the next two.
[time=1720] There is an issue of study called contemporary theology.
[time=1724] Theology is the simple study of Bible doctrine.
[time=1728] Contemporary theology is the perspective of saying, "What is happening in thinking today that is affecting theology?"
[time=1736] There is no passage of scripture more significant in contemporary theology than these next three chapters of 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 13 and 14.
[time=1751] The issue that faces Christianity today more than any other single issue is the issue of spiritual gifts, gifts like healing.
[time=1761] I mean, can this guy really heal me if I just reach out and touch the television set?
[time=1767] There have been a line of people who said, "Yes, that man can heal you." Does this lady really have the ability to predict the future and be absolutely right?
[time=1777] And if she can, can she tell me about the stock market next week?
[time=1781] Does this person who stands and lifts their hands and tilts their head and begins to speak words that neither they or I understand really have a message from God?
[time=1795] Those are issues that need to be faced.
[time=1798] 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 13 and 14 speak to the issue of what we call the charismatic movement.
[time=1806] Before we ever start, I want to say two things.
[time=1810] First of all, I want to say that our study today is not born out of any trend that we're facing in this church.
[time=1817] I have not received reports that in one of our adult Sunday school classes that somebody laid hands on somebody else and they were slain in the spirit.
[time=1826] That has not happened.
[time=1828] There have not been a surge of charismatic Bible studies with speaking in tongues that have taken over our home Bible studies.
[time=1836] That has not happened.
[time=1838] There is not somebody else in our community pounding their pulpit today, teaching another doctrine and I want to pound louder and longer.
[time=1847] That is not happening.
[time=1849] We have been studying through 1 Corinthians for a long time.
[time=1854] I believe it was last September that we started in chapter 1 and we're simply moving through this book of the Bible.
[time=1860] We are not reacting to what somebody else is doing or saying or teaching.
[time=1865] We are simply teaching through God's Word.
[time=1868] If you differ with us today, you're welcome here.
[time=1871] If you believe differently than I believe or the doctrine of this church believes, you're welcome to worship with us as long as you honor our beliefs.
[time=1879] If you try to impose your beliefs on ours, we then would encourage you to go to a church that believes as you believe.
[time=1886] If you found that this church gives you an opportunity to grow in Christ and you can accept our doctrine, although you in your heart might believe differently, you're welcome in this fellowship today.
[time=1898] Today, as we study, I'm going to read for you from the new international version of the Bible.
[time=1904] I want to take a moment to explain that.
[time=1906] I do this from time to time.
[time=1908] Most Sundays I read from a King James Bible.
[time=1911] There are two reasons why I usually read from a King James Bible.
[time=1915] One reason is more people than not still use a King James Bible.
[time=1920] That's a good reason.
[time=1922] Now the real reason.
[time=1923] The King James Bible I have, there are an awful lot of passages that I don't remember their address.
[time=1929] That it's 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 8.
[time=1932] But I had my Bible so long I know it's on the right hand page, the left hand column, about this far down from the top.
[time=1941] That's not a real spiritual reason to select a translation, but that's what I do.
[time=1946] Well why today am I using the new international version?
[time=1950] I believe the new international version has two advantages.
[time=1953] First of all, it has the advantage that it was translated from more accurate documents than the King James Bible.
[time=1963] The King James Bible is accurate and it is authoritative and we use it and it is great.
[time=1969] However, in the three to four hundred years since that translation was done, a great deal of work has been done in the area of archeology and the discovery of what we call papayri.
[time=1981] That's simply a text, a handwritten text on papyrus.
[time=1986] And we're able to put all these texts together and deduce what the Apostle Paul said within a 99.5% accuracy according to FF Bruce, the leading authority on papriology.
[time=1998] But since the King James Bible was translated, we've made discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[time=2004] So we are simply using a translation that has greater documentation.
[time=2009] The second reason why we use it from time to time is I don't speak the way King Jimmy spoke, I don't know about you.
[time=2017] And these passages are significantly challenging enough to understand that I need every break I can get and I sense you do too.
[time=2027] So rather than struggling with verbs that say ETH on the end of them and ye and thou's and words like super flirty of hottiness, which Noah Webster didn't even translate, we'll use for our study, this text for the next three chapters of study.
[time=2045] All right, all that's introduction.
[time=2047] You probably think we're going to give our invitation and then now.
[time=2050] Now we're going to start our message.
[time=2052] First, don't say amen. First Corinthians chapter 12 verses one through three from the new international version.
[time=2060] Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
[time=2070] You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other, you were influenced and led astray to dumb idols.
[time=2081] Therefore, I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, Jesus be cursed and no one says but by the Spirit, Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2101] These three verses start an introduction of a whole new section of first Corinthians.
[time=2109] There is a little phrase that says now about or now concerning if you brought your King James today.
[time=2116] That little construction appears time and time again in first Corinthians.
[time=2121] Paul said in chapter seven verse one, now about and he went on to describe singleness.
[time=2129] Chapter seven verse twenty five, he said, now about and he went on to describe another dimension of marriage and singleness.
[time=2137] Chapter eight verse one, he said, now about and he went on to describe problems that face a lifestyle.
[time=2144] Do we do this that has been done in pagan temples or do we refuse to do it even though it's fine to eat?
[time=2151] Now about. Chapter twelve verse one, now about spiritual.
[time=2156] Chapter sixteen verse one, now about the collection.
[time=2160] Now what that little phrase now about does is it triggers to us that Paul is changing his whole topic.
[time=2168] Chapter eleven ends with the discussion is finished about church ordinances and now about spiritual gifts.
[time=2176] You see what happened is Paul communicated to the Corinthians by a letter.
[time=2181] That letter and issues in their church caused the Corinthians to have some concerns, so they wrote a letter to Paul.
[time=2190] And they took that letter and they gave it to three men were told who those men are in chapter sixteen.
[time=2196] Fortunatus, the Faunus, and Archicus.
[time=2200] These three men bring to Paul the letter of the Corinthians and Paul either opens it or unfolds it or lays it out and he begins to see the questions and the concerns that the Corinthians had.
[time=2212] And this letter that we call first Corinthians is largely Paul's response to their questions.
[time=2219] And by looking at chapter twelve, we are very easily led to believe that they had questions about the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2227] They had questions about who the Holy Spirit was, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and particularly spiritual gifts.
[time=2236] Now we'll spend two weeks on these three verses because it is foundational to our study.
[time=2243] We're simply looking at this opening statement. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
[time=2251] There are three concerns that are listed here. The first is the concern of the Corinthians. That's implicit in this text.
[time=2258] They are implying that they have questions about spiritual things. The word gifts actually does not occur until verse four, but our translators have helped us by instead of leaving just an adjective spiritual there he says spiritual gifts.
[time=2274] Now the Corinthians are writing of a concern and their concern is about spiritual gifts.
[time=2281] Now we're going to do a little Bible searching today. Take the time to find these references.
[time=2287] You need to understand some background about the Corinthians. Turn with me back to chapter one of this same letter to the Church of Corinth, 1 Corinthians chapter one, and in verses five to seven we'll discover some characteristics of the Corinthians.
[time=2303] Verse five says this, Paul says, "For in him Christ Jesus you have been enriched in every way in all your speaking and in all your knowledge because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.
[time=2323] Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for the Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. He will keep you strong to the end so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=2341] Now these Corinthians are writing of their concern about spiritual gifts and what we need to know about them is this, the Corinthians were gifted people. God had blessed them with spiritual gifts.
[time=2355] Particularly he says you've got the gifts of speaking and knowledge. You've got people in your church who God gives knowledge that they couldn't have intuitively, that they couldn't have empirically, that they could not have reasonably.
[time=2370] God has revealed to them knowledge and given them the gifts of declaring that knowledge. You've got gifted people. Not only do you have those revelatory and communicatory gifts, you have not fallen behind in any spiritual gift.
[time=2387] There's no church you can say. All those poor Corinthians. They don't have the gift of helps. All the Corinthian church, I was there. They don't have the gift of faith.
[time=2397] Boy, we need to help the Corinthian church because they don't have the gift of giving. They had every spiritual gift. They were gifted people.
[time=2407] Now let's look at a second description of them. Turn to chapter 3 verse 1. Now let me just set this stage for you. Chapter 2 Paul has talked first about the natural person.
[time=2420] The natural person is the man or woman who has never received Christ. There are typical normal human being and the Spirit of God is not in their life because they've never been born into the family of God by the new birth and the loudest Spirit of Christ to come in them. They're totally natural.
[time=2436] Now in contrast to the natural man, Paul then speaks in chapter 2 about the spiritual man or the spiritual woman. That is the person who the Spirit of God has come into their heart and is leading them, directing them and controlling them.
[time=2451] Natural person, spiritual person. Now look at chapter 3 verse 1. He says, "Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual that is worldly." King James carnal.
[time=2465] Now he calls them brothers. That means they're spiritual and they're not natural, but he says, "I can't address you. I can't talk to you. I can't reason with you as though you're spiritual people because although the Spirit's in you, you are worldly. You are carnal."
[time=2480] Now that means that the Corinthians were not thinking the way God's word thinks. They were not reasoning the way God reasons. They were not acting the way God's spirit would lead them to act. They had the spirit in them, but the old nature was still ruling and dominating their thought life and their perceptions.
[time=2498] So on the one hand they were very, very gifted people, yet on the other hand they were very, very carnal people. And the rest of this epistle reads like a modern day soap opera have sinned at every gross level you can imagine. They were carnal.
[time=2519] Yet they were gifted. A third characteristic of these Corinthians is deduced from chapters 12, 13 and 14, and that is they were confused. They're gifted, they're carnal, but when it came to spiritual issues, they were confused.
[time=2536] So they wrote to Paul and Paul says now concerning spiritual gifts. Let's stop and make this very, very important principle before our study goes any further.
[time=2548] The principle is this. Being spiritually gifted does not necessarily mean you are spiritually mature. You see the Corinthians had the gifts, but they were immature.
[time=2562] And if there is an heir that we make in modern Christianity today, we confuse maturity with talent.
[time=2572] If somebody can sing, well, they're a spiritual leader. If somebody else has a winsome personality and can communicate, they're a spiritual leader.
[time=2583] If somebody else is a good talker and when they talk, people listen, we assume they're spiritually mature. If somebody else can put a big television ministry together, then we say they're spiritually mature.
[time=2596] Beloved, you can be the most talented person in natural talents and endowments of spiritual gifts of anybody that this church will ever meet and you can still be carnal and you can still be immature.
[time=2608] Don't ever confuse the two. And there is great confusion in our generation because people think because somebody has talent or persuasive skills that they must therefore be a spokesperson for God and they must be spiritual and that is not necessarily true.
[time=2627] Now, it's certainly not true that if someone has talent that they're therefore have mature, that's not true either. But the two do not necessarily go hand in hand.
[time=2637] You can be mature and not really possess great gifts. You can be immature and possess great gifts and you can be mature and possess great gifts.
[time=2649] But don't ever assume because this person has talent that they are therefore mature and they are therefore a leader and we should listen to what they say.
[time=2658] If they have talent, that means one thing. They have talent.
[time=2663] We had a young man come to our church a number of years ago and he had talent. He could sing.
[time=2669] But he had a problem. He knew that he could sing and he loved to tell you how well he could sing.
[time=2676] He wasn't even bashful. He wasn't even humble. He tore that page from the dictionary.
[time=2681] He just pompously walked in and I can sing better than anybody around here and I want to sing solos.
[time=2687] There is no maturity there. He never sang. Because to serve Christ you need to have more than talent.
[time=2695] There must be maturity and there must be character.
[time=2699] And in the middle of three chapters about spiritual gifts Paul takes the middle chapter to get away from the emphasis on gifts and get back to the emphasis on character.
[time=2709] The gifts of the spirit are not nearly as important for you to develop as the fruit of the spirit is.
[time=2717] And that's why at the end of chapter 12 when he lists all of these gifts he says, "I show to you a more excellent way."
[time=2724] What's that? Chapter 13, love. The chief fruit of the spirit.
[time=2729] What's our principle? The principle is this.
[time=2733] Spiritual talent and spiritual gifts does not necessarily mean that there is spiritual maturity there and we need to be people of discernment.
[time=2742] When you turn on that television set, when you hear this speaker and this pulpit, when you hear me say something, it is not based upon anything other than what does God's words say.
[time=2753] Whether I say it good or bad, if it's biblical we need to receive it. If it's not biblical you need to reject it.
[time=2760] No matter who says it, me or someone else, if it's someone with talent or someone who you really struggle to listen to, don't accept it just because it comes from a gifted source.
[time=2772] Don't reject it because it comes from someone who does not have gifts.
[time=2777] Now, the Corinthians were concerned about spiritual gifts. Paul, however, had two concerns of his own.
[time=2784] So he writes, "Now concerning spiritual gift, brothers." Paul's first concern was this, that they would remain united as a family of God.
[time=2795] Brothers, that relationship, that identification that we are of one bond and united together in Christ Jesus.
[time=2805] The Corinthians needed to hear that word, "brothers," said again and again and again.
[time=2813] Turn back to chapter 1, please, and you'll see the point.
[time=2818] Chapter 1, verse 10, Paul says, "I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree with one another, so that there may be no divisions among you,
[time=2834] and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought." My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
[time=2847] What I mean is this, one of you says, "I follow Paul."
[time=2854] Another says, "I follow Paulis."
[time=2860] Still another, "I follow Cephas." And a fourth, "I follow Jesus." You see that he had to call them to attention, brothers, brothers.
[time=2874] Because this church was being fractured in its family relationship by personalities and the gifts that those personalities were able to demonstrate.
[time=2886] Paul came and he demonstrated spiritual leadership with spiritual gifts, and there were those that liked Paul and they liked his gifts.
[time=2894] Paul has had a different personality and he possessed different gifts, and there were those that rallied behind this gift because they liked that gift better than this gift.
[time=2905] I don't know of anything that has the potential to divide a church more than the issue of spiritual gifts.
[time=2913] And beloved, we may not always agree on a doctrinal issue,
[time=2919] but we must always remain as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=2926] And so today I ask you to pray for me.
[time=2929] It will take us months to study through these three chapters.
[time=2934] It will take us two weeks to look at three verses.
[time=2937] Will you pray for me that in these months of study that God would guide my heart and my tongue,
[time=2944] that I never say anything that is unkind or unbrotherly about someone who would take a different interpretation of these verses than I would?
[time=2954] And I will pray for you.
[time=2957] That God will guard your heart, that you not be puffed up with knowledge and say, "See I told you so, I was right all along."
[time=2968] There will always be someone who will give an opinion.
[time=2971] You will always be able to find someone who agrees with you, guard your hearts, that we are always brotherly.
[time=2978] It was said of the Lord Jesus Christ that we beheld His glory, the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=2987] We must endeavor to teach the truth of God's Word, but that must always be tempered with a gracious spirit.
[time=2995] Allow me to read to you from my favorite author, Charles Swindall.
[time=3000] He's written an excellent little booklet on tongues.
[time=3003] And at the very beginning, he puts this perspective that I would want to borrow.
[time=3009] It is also a controversial issue.
[time=3013] Whenever it bursts on the scene, it brings unrest, misunderstanding, disharmony and disunity.
[time=3021] Just recently, I learned that in a large church, a split was conducted over this issue,
[time=3028] leaving about 700 families, explanation point, confused and drifting.
[time=3036] A week does not pass without my receiving several letters asking for information and clarification.
[time=3043] It must be the critical subject of the 80s.
[time=3046] There are good people on both sides, as well as good people still on the fence.
[time=3054] Sincere people, people who love God and want to serve Him,
[time=3060] people who differ in their opinions regarding the gifts of the Spirit.
[time=3067] Swindall writes, "I write these words free of anger, free of malice.
[time=3074] I remain teachable in the Spirit of God and open to the Word of God."
[time=3081] May that be characteristic of every one of us in this ministry?
[time=3084] That we recognize that there are good men and women on both sides of the issue and that we always regard them as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=3094] Paul's first concern was that they remain as brothers in Christ.
[time=3101] His second concern was this, that they would not, however, remain ignorant.
[time=3107] Brethren, I do not want you to remain ignorant.
[time=3111] The word ignorant is a word that is the word "knowledge, genosis" with a little "A" in front of it and the "A" negates what follows.
[time=3119] If you're normal, you're normal.
[time=3121] If you put an "A" in front of that, a little "B" to help the syllables, you're abnormal.
[time=3127] That means you're not normal.
[time=3130] You put that "A" in front of the word "knowledge" and it means you are not knowledgeable.
[time=3135] You're ignorant.
[time=3137] We put the "A" in front of that word "genosis" and we come away with English word agnostic.
[time=3143] An agnostic is someone who says, "I don't know." Paul looked at the Corinthians with all of their gifts, but with all of their carnality and all of their confusion, he says, "You don't know anything.
[time=3155] And I don't want you to stay that way.
[time=3157] So I'm going to teach you." And he ushered forth three chapters of teaching on spiritual gifts.
[time=3163] Why? Because he didn't want them to remain ignorant.
[time=3167] Do you remember Hogan's heroes from our childhood days?
[time=3172] Perhaps you'll remember that adorable little character, Sergeant Schultz.
[time=3176] It was all he could do to get his military buckle across his rotan profile.
[time=3181] He had a mustache that he could twitch and eyes that he could roll back farther than his receding hairline.
[time=3188] Whenever Hogan and the rest of the boys were up to something and Stalock 13, you remember Schultz, "I know nothing.
[time=3196] I know nothing." You know why he said, "I know nothing." Because if you know something, then you're responsible, aren't you?
[time=3205] But we tried to plead ignorance as an excuse.
[time=3208] And Paul says, "I don't want you ever to say, 'I don't know.
[time=3212] I know nothing. I'm ignorant.
[time=3215] I want you to no longer remain ignorant.'" And so he declares to them, "The need to study." Beloved, you've probably heard it said, "I have." There are those that say, "Don't teach doctrine.
[time=3230] Doctrine only divides. We should all just love one another." Doesn't that sound sweet? It really does.
[time=3238] And there's a part of me that says, "That's really a good philosophy of ministry." But also, I know that it's a deadly philosophy of ministry.
[time=3248] Yes, we are to love.
[time=3251] By love, all men Jesus said, "We'll know that you're my disciples." But we're also to teach doctrine.
[time=3259] Write this reference down.
[time=3261] Study it later.
[time=3263] John chapter 7, verse 17.
[time=3266] Jesus said, "He that will do His will," meaning the will of the Father, "who will ever do God's will let Him know the doctrine." Do you want to know God's will for your life?
[time=3279] Many of you are contemplating marriage.
[time=3281] And you'd love someone to say, "It's God's will for you to get married." Some of you would like to hear someone say, "It's God's will that you don't get married." Some of you would like to hear someone say, "It's God's will that you go to this school and not to that school."
[time=3295] Some of you would like to know whether it's God's will, whether you enter into this business arrangement or not.
[time=3300] Do you want to know what God's will is?
[time=3302] It's God's will that you know doctrine.
[time=3305] The authoritative, systematic teaching of God's Word.
[time=3308] If you don't know the scriptures, you're out of God's will today.
[time=3314] Here's a second reference for you to write down and investigate further.
[time=3318] 1 Timothy chapter 4, verse 13.
[time=3322] Paul wrote to Timothy, a young man, probably not 40 years old, but a relatively young man.
[time=3330] He said, "Timothy, until I come, give attention." And he lists three things.
[time=3335] To reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.
[time=3341] Reading means the reading of the scriptures.
[time=3343] Exhortation means what I'm doing today.
[time=3345] People teaching the scriptures.
[time=3347] Doctrine means the systematizing of the truth about the person and work of God.
[time=3353] Give attention to those three things.
[time=3356] Here's a third reference.
[time=3359] 2 Timothy 2, 15.
[time=3362] It says this, "Study to show thyself approved, a workman who needs not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
[time=3375] God expects you to be able to open his word and to discern it.
[time=3381] And when you listen to a summer Bible conference speaker, when you listen to a television broadcast,
[time=3387] when you listen to a sermon to be able to say, "That squares with the scriptures that I know."
[time=3394] Or to be able to say, "I've studied God's Word, and that doesn't sound right to me.
[time=3400] I'm going to investigate this before I accept it." God expects you to be able to rightly discern and to divide his word.
[time=3412] And if you cannot, you are the victims of cults, of extremist youth movements, of deceptions of every kind.
[time=3422] Because every one of those things are a parasite off of God's word.
[time=3427] And they prey on people like you who have a little bit of Bible knowledge but cannot rightly divide the word of truth.
[time=3437] Learn to rightly divide the word of truth.
[time=3442] Therefore, it is not our option today to say, "We won't teach doctrine. We will just love everybody."
[time=3451] Beloved, it doesn't have to be in either or. It can be a both-and.
[time=3456] It doesn't have to be either teach doctrine or love people.
[time=3461] You can teach doctrine and be winsome and be loving. And by God's grace, that's our prayer through this study.
[time=3468] Paul said, "Speak the truth in love."
[time=3474] That's doctrine, speaking the truth. But how do you do it in love?
[time=3479] Colossians, chapter four, verse six says, "Let your speech always be with grace seasoned with salt.
[time=3490] Soften it. Crouch it in grace. Serve it in love."
[time=3497] It's not in either or. It's a both-and.
[time=3502] The doctrine that you need to know more than anything else is the doctrine that Jesus Christ is Lord.
