[time=112] The great black pastor, Shadrach Meshach Lockridge, described the lordship of Jesus Christ in this way.
[time=120] He said, "God didn't have to sow his laundry mark "inside the lapel of the meadow, he owns them.
[time=127] "And God didn't have to sign his name "to the bottom of the sunset, he owns them.
[time=133] "And God didn't have to chisel his initials "at the bottom of the majestic mountains, he owns them.
[time=139] "And God didn't have to put his brand "on the cattle of a thousand hills.
[time=143] "He owns them, and praise God, he owns you, "and he owns me." (upbeat music) Good morning and welcome to an hour of Bible study and music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=160] We're glad you've chosen to join us this Lord's Day.
[time=162] Today Rick's message is entitled, "Jesus is Lord" and is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[time=168] We urge you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, where we'll be looking at verses one through three.
[time=176] Today our special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir, singing a song entitled, "Holy is the Lord" taken from their new album.
[time=185] We'll also be hearing from Brian Losen and Susan Turgham.
[time=191] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen each week at this time on this station.
[time=201] It is our prayer that the Lord will use the entire worship service to draw you close to the land closer to Him.
[time=208] Today's service is being telecast from the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=212] Now let's join the congregation for this special worship service from the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=217] (upbeat music)
[time=226] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=297] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=301] It is an extra special joy today to be able to greet you in this morning worship service here at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=309] It's a joy for us to be able to assemble in one large auditorium like this.
[time=313] I see many of you are lost because you couldn't sit in your regular seat today, but we're glad that you came that we can worship together.
[time=321] It's a very special day that we can be here in this place and come to the very heart of our city to proclaim that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=329] Our service today is really not anything more than a humble attempt of my heart, the choirs, and yours is a body of people to say that simple statement.
[time=338] Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=340] I hope that you know Him today.
[time=342] No matter where we go or what we perform by way of music, the message is Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=348] I hope that you know Him.
[time=350] Welcome today to our morning worship service and also a word of greeting to our friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=357] We trust that God will use this time together to strengthen our faith in Him and to honor Him in song and in the truth of our hearts, we've come today to honor the Lord with our song.
[time=369] To honor the Lord with our song of praise, our choir leads us now.
[time=373] (upbeat music)
[time=379] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=593] - What a privilege to sing and to honor the Lord with our voices.
[time=598] I am indeed grateful that He has allowed us to express our joy of our salvation through the medium of music.
[time=606] On the back of your bulletin is a medley of courses.
[time=610] We'd like to have you join in now as we sing, "This is the day that the Lord hath made.
[time=614] "We will rejoice and be glad in it." ("This is the day, this is the day that the Lord hath made"
[time=623] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=765] - I'd like to have you sing that last course one more time and really take it to heart.
[time=770] Let's ask the Lord to bind our church together with love for one another and for the lost of our community, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=778] Sing that course one more time with me.
[time=781] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=810] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=815] We appreciate it when you participate with us in singing praises to our God.
[time=819] Our special music is from our own people from Black Hawk Baptist Church today and we're asking Susan Toywrack to come and sing a song for us entitled Sing praises.
[time=831] This song was written just a few months ago by Scott Schindler who's been assisting me in the music department and just recently graduated from Fort Wayne Bible College.
[time=841] He wrote the song and dedication of his home church building just a few months ago in Salino, Ohio.
[time=847] Let's listen now as Susan sings for us, Sing praises.
[time=852] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=969] - I certainly hope we haven't confused you today.
[time=987] As you watch the Bible Hour, we are obviously on a different location.
[time=992] Today our Sunday morning services are at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=996] We're having some maintenance work done on the floor at Blackhawk Baptist Church, and we're able to come down here to downtown Fort Wayne and bring both of our morning worship services together and one large celebration here at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1011] We did this a year ago and it was such a great experience that we decided whether we had a maintenance need or not, we were going to do it again this year.
[time=1019] Well, today's the day, and we're certainly thankful that we can be here worshiping the Lord in the heart of our downtown area.
[time=1027] Tonight we'll be having an evening service here again at the Grand Wayne at six o'clock.
[time=1032] You might have felt that you missed out on some of the excitement this morning in not being here, but we'll have another evening service tonight at six o'clock.
[time=1040] I'll be looking forward to teaching God's word and want to encourage you to come and enjoy all the special music that will be a part of this evening's service.
[time=1048] We certainly hope that you can come.
[time=1051] Today we were talking about spiritual gifts in our service last Sunday and today.
[time=1058] The gift of tongues is the one that focuses most of the attention in charismatic movements today.
[time=1064] What is it that God's word has to say about this important issue of spiritual gifts and this unique gift of tongues?
[time=1072] Well, we have a helpful little book that we'd love to send to you that comes from the heart and the pen of Charles Swindall.
[time=1079] Charles Swindall is my favorite Bible communicator today.
[time=1083] He is such a gifted man to understand the scriptures and to present them so practically that I think the simplest child can understand them but the greatest scholar can appreciate them.
[time=1094] This fine pamphlet on tongues is something we think that you should have.
[time=1098] It's so important to us that we'll send it to you free if you'll just write to us today.
[time=1103] Our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1109] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1113] Once again, our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne,
[time=1120] Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=1125] If you'll write to us today and simply request the pamphlet entitled tongues, we'll send you a copy just as quickly as we can.
[time=1133] Many of you have written into us before and sent along your words of encouragement and we certainly appreciate that.
[time=1140] Others of you have written sharing financial support and we obviously appreciate that as well.
[time=1145] We've written a letter to many of you telling you about our plans to purchase some new equipment.
[time=1151] That's always an ongoing need of a television ministry.
[time=1154] The cameras and the technical equipment that we're using today were purchased well over 10 years ago.
[time=1160] Obviously, they don't last forever.
[time=1162] And we're anticipating replacing those and asking you if you would like to be a partner with us to help us in that way.
[time=1169] Please do prayerfully consider the letter we sent to you and we'll be anxious to hear from you.
[time=1175] Coming up in just a few weeks, we have a special musical guest coming with us to help highlight our summer.
[time=1181] Music has such a power to encourage and to motivate us.
[time=1185] We depend on it as a part of our spiritual life.
[time=1189] Paul said that we're to speak to each other in Psalms and hymns and spiritual praises.
[time=1194] What we have is our guest coming on August the 10th, Johnny Hall.
[time=1198] And I hope that you can join us for that very special day of worship and music.
[time=1203] Now as we go back to our morning worship service at the Grand Wayne Center, I hope that you'll open your Bible and study with us in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 on the great theme that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=1216] More than anything else, we hope you know him personally as your Lord and as your Savior.
[time=1222] [MUSIC]
[time=1225] When you're up against a struggle that shatters all
[time=1243] your dreams and your hopes been cruelly crushed by Satan's manifested schemes and you feel the urge within you
[time=1255] to submit to earthly fears, don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear.
[time=1268] Praise the Lord.
[time=1271] He can work through those who praise him.
[time=1274] Praise the Lord for our God and have its praise.
[time=1281] Praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you.
[time=1287] Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him.
[time=1300] Now, Satan is a liar, and he'd like to make us think
[time=1306] that we are paupers when we really are the children of the King.
[time=1313] So lift up the mighty shield of faith for the battle must be won.
[time=1318] We know that Jesus Christ is risen.
[time=1322] So the Word's already done.
[time=1327] Praise the Lord.
[time=1331] He can work through those who praise him.
[time=1334] Praise the Lord for our God and have its praise.
[time=1340] Praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you.
[time=1346] Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you when you praise him.
[time=1357] Praise the Lord.
[time=1361] He can work through those who praise him.
[time=1363] Praise the Lord for our God and have its praise.
[time=1369] Praise the Lord for the chains that seem to bind you.
[time=1375] Serve only to remind you that they drop powerless behind you
[time=1381] when you praise him.
[time=1385] Praise him.
[time=1391] Praise him when you praise him.
[time=1400] When you praise the Lord.
[time=1416] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1423] The very message of that song may be a description of your life in recent days.
[time=1429] That there have been struggles.
[time=1431] There has been adversity.
[time=1433] There have been days of disappointment.
[time=1435] But yet not as a trite response of emotionalism, you found that within your own heart that you could give God thanks for his faithfulness and his graciousness in sustaining you through those trials.
[time=1447] I hope that each of us will grow in our ability to give praise.
[time=1451] One who is home with us to give praise today is Missy Vickery.
[time=1454] Missy has been a part of our church for a number of years, a graduate of our school, and Missy has been traveling the last two summers with the continental singers.
[time=1463] As she has traveled, she's had the opportunity last year to be behind the Iron Curtain.
[time=1467] This year in the Philippines, in Malaysia, and in Singapore, they've shown a film on Jesus Christ and then sang to audiences totaling throughout the summer 12,000 people and have seen literally thousands of people enlightened and come to the knowledge of Christ, our Savior.
[time=1484] And we want to magnify and praise God today that he has provided an opportunity for us to worship him.
[time=1491] But before Missy leads, let us pray together, thanking God for his great character.
[time=1496] God, David, said, "O magnified the Lord with me, come let us exalt His name together." And God, this morning, as we've met, we've reflected on the difficulties of life, but we've also reflected on your gracious, faithful provision.
[time=1512] God, we praise you today that you are our God.
[time=1515] And as God, you give strength to our life in the valley, that as our God, you are faithful and unchanging, that as our God, you are holy and true and just and righteous, that you alone are fair, that you alone are faithful.
[time=1532] Lord Jesus, we thank you today, that with firmness of discipline, you chasten us when we're out of your will, but there is always the love of God that draws us back.
[time=1542] Oh God, today, we've come to magnify you.
[time=1545] And in this moment of prayer, it is actually the testimony of our hearts, God, to say that we love you, that we believe in you, and in your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, for it's in His name that we pray.
[time=1558] [AMEN] (upbeat music)
[time=1570] (singing in foreign language)
[time=1600] (upbeat music)
[time=1630] (singing in foreign language)
[time=1660] (upbeat music) (audience applauding)
[time=1685] - Thank you, Missy.
[time=1688] That is a great song, and obviously comes from a heart of a young lady who's committed to Jesus Christ, making her life count to magnify Him.
[time=1698] I hope you brought your Bibles with you today, that we can study God's Word together.
[time=1703] Please open the Bible that you have with you, and if you don't have one and you see a friend near you, just ask if you could look on with them, that we can study God's Word together today.
[time=1712] We'll be looking at 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verses one, two, and three, but before we read that, I just wanna tell you about a song that I heard some time ago.
[time=1722] I've searched for this song, not that I could sing it to you, but just so I could tell you about it with a little bit more detail.
[time=1728] It's a song, it's somewhat of a comical song, cute little song called "The Day the Squirrel Went to Church." Have you ever heard that song?
[time=1737] Oh, this is a cute little song.
[time=1739] It takes place in the deep south, where maybe they're given to just a little bit more emotionalism and enthusiasm, and they're worship services than we are.
[time=1747] The preacher had just given a long and hard message, and in the back, there were these two little boys who had caught a squirrel and brought it to church with them in the shoebox.
[time=1757] And just at the time when the church service was getting very intense and the pastor was calling for a great emotion, the squirrel got loose.
[time=1766] And the squirrel started working his way between ladies' feats and causing them to cry out with a little bit of fear, and they thought the spirit was really starting to move in the back of the church.
[time=1776] And finally, the squirrel worked its way up to one farm who had a big pair of baggy overhauls on.
[time=1782] Well, you know what happened?
[time=1783] That squirrel started up one leg, and then back down that leg, and up the other one.
[time=1786] And finally, this boy jumps up in the middle of the imitation and yells, "Something's got to hold on me!" And the revival started right at that moment, because if that guy, if God could get ahold of him, then something's really happening in church today.
[time=1800] Well, that's a cute little song.
[time=1802] The day the squirrel went to church.
[time=1804] But you know, there are those who meet today, and they're hoping that something is going to happen, that there'll be some great event where God's gonna grab ahold of them, and they will have a personal experience that will be so unique that no one will ever say, you have not had an experience with God, that it'll be something mystical, something so esoteric and ecstatic, that it is God coming to you, and something will get ahold of you.
[time=1832] And our generation were given to great emotionalism, and there is a quest for that personal experience.
[time=1838] But then how do we interpret that experience?
[time=1841] Something may get ahold of you today, but how do you know whether that, which got ahold of you as the very spirit of God, or whether it's just emotionalism, or whether a squirrel came to church today?
[time=1853] First Corinthians, chapter 12 and verses one through three.
[time=1856] The Apostle Paul writes, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
[time=1864] You know that when you were pagan, somehow or other, you were influenced and led astray to dumb idols.
[time=1871] Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the spirit of God says, Jesus be cursed, and no one can say, Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit." Well, let me give you a very brief little outline of these three verses.
[time=1892] We talked about verse one last week.
[time=1894] There was a concern.
[time=1896] Actually, there were several concerns.
[time=1898] There was the concern of the Corinthians.
[time=1900] They had written to Paul about spiritual gifts.
[time=1902] They didn't understand how the gifts were to be used and when and whose gifts should have preeminence.
[time=1908] So they were concerned about spiritual gifts.
[time=1911] Paul, on the other hand, was concerned, first of all, that in these days of difficulty and division in Corinth, that they would not be divided, but that they would remain as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1922] Secondly, Paul was concerned that they would not remain spiritually ignorant, simply interpreting each experience on their own, but that he could educate them with the very principles of God so that they would know how to interpret their experience.
[time=1937] So there were those concerns.
[time=1939] But then following those concerns, there is the identification of some confusion.
[time=1944] That's verse two.
[time=1946] He says, "You know that when you were pagan, "somehow or other, you were influenced "and led astray by dumb idols." Now I really don't think here that Paul is becoming insensitive in course and saying, "If you're of a different religion "than I am, then you're dumb." I mean, you're just plain stupid to disagree with me.
[time=1965] It wasn't that insensitivity.
[time=1966] The word dumb actually means enable to communicate.
[time=1970] Someone who cannot speak.
[time=1972] We in our generation have referred to it as someone who lacks intelligence, but this is not saying there's a lack of intelligence, just an inability to communicate.
[time=1981] Now Paul was saying, "You, before you came to know "Christ a Savior, you were influenced somehow "or other to actually follow idols "that were dumb, incapable of speaking." Let me just give you a verse that talks about that very briefly.
[time=1997] Back in the Old Testament, in both the books of Habakkah and in the book of Psalms, it describes the inability of an idol to speak.
[time=2007] Psalm 115, verse two.
[time=2010] Why do the nations say, "Where is their God?
[time=2013] "Our God is in heaven.
[time=2015] "He does whatever pleases him." But their idols are silver and gold made by hands of men.
[time=2025] They have mouths, but they cannot speak.
[time=2028] Eyes, but they cannot see.
[time=2030] They have ears, but they cannot hear.
[time=2032] Noses that cannot smell, they have hands, but they cannot feel, feet that they cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
[time=2041] That's a good description of an idol, isn't it?
[time=2044] Men and women would come in that day and tragically, in our day, and they would come to an idol, something that was made perhaps with precious metals, but was simply formed by human hands, and it had all the appearances of a human body, except for one thing, life.
[time=2060] It was dead, it couldn't talk, it couldn't hear, it couldn't speak, it couldn't say anything.
[time=2066] And yet, the paradox of what Paul's saying is, you knew that you made it.
[time=2073] You knew that you formed its mouth, its ears, its nose, its hands, and feet, and yet, you believed that it was real.
[time=2081] You actually believed that somehow that was the God that you were to worship.
[time=2086] You were influenced to follow something that was incapable of speaking, and yet you believed it spoke to you.
[time=2093] That is strange, isn't it?
[time=2096] How could people who were intelligent, and these people were intelligent?
[time=2100] When you think of the ancient Greeks, please do not think of uncivilized barbarian, these people were wise.
[time=2108] Do you know that in the Greek concept of thinking, they had already deduced that all the world was made of little particles that they called atoms?
[time=2118] These were not barbarians, these were wise people.
[time=2121] Do you know that in 100 years before Christ, a man by the name of Ceranisis, wrote a book on gynecology, and in that book, he described medical procedures that are still used today.
[time=2133] When you have a baby, and there are some difficulties, and you go to have a Caesarian section, do you know where that name Caesarian came from?
[time=2140] It came from the days of Julius Caesar.
[time=2143] Caesar, Caesarian.
[time=2145] These were not ignorant people, and yet you have to ask the question, how then could these highly intelligent people actually leave their intelligence aside, go sit in front of an idol they made and say, speak to me, idol, but they did, and they were influenced, and they were led astray.
[time=2165] Well, how then were they influenced and led astray?
[time=2168] Paul has actually given insight into that.
[time=2170] Back in chapter 10, just a few verses earlier, look at chapter 10, verses 19 and 20.
[time=2177] Paul is speaking about the Lord's table, communion, we would call that, but he's also talking to them about being separate, not identifying with paganism on one day of the week, and then with Christ on another day, and then finally blending them together.
[time=2192] He says, you can't do that, but notice this observation in verses 19 and 20.
[time=2198] Do I mean that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything or that an idol is anything?
[time=2205] No.
[time=2206] Paul's saying, now don't become alarmed.
[time=2207] I'm not saying that there's anything to these idols.
[time=2210] I'm not trying to personify them or to make anthropomorphisms as though they were life.
[time=2215] He says, no, there's nothing there, however, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to participate with demons.
[time=2227] You know what Paul was saying there?
[time=2228] He is saying that behind that dumb idol, there is some real power, and that real power is the power of Satan, and he has fallen angels that we call demons in the scripture, and that these demons actually had a power of magnetism to draw people into the false religions of that day.
[time=2247] The Bible tells us that Satan himself is a deceiver who masquerades as an angel of light, and that he has real power, that his demons have real power.
[time=2258] So while that idol was dumb, it had no life, it had no power, there was some power that stood behind that, and that is the power of Satan himself in the form of demons.
[time=2269] Now, we think of demons, and most of us believe in demons.
[time=2273] I do believe in demons.
[time=2275] I believe that Satan was an angel created by God, and that he has great power, and I believe that angels followed him and is rebelling against God, and they too have great power, and they're working in ways that we may or may not ever be cognizant of, but they do have real power.
[time=2292] But you know the ancient Greeks understood that as well.
[time=2294] Let me just quote something for you.
[time=2296] It's a little bit long, but allow me to quote this for you.
[time=2299] There is a character in a writing called the symposium.
[time=2304] The character's name is Dio-tima.
[time=2306] It actually means the fear of Dio, or fear of gods.
[time=2309] Dio-tima is made to put forth a view of demons as intermediaries between men and gods, Dio-tima says in the symposium.
[time=2318] All the demon kind comes between the divine and mortals.
[time=2323] What special powers I said belong to this order of beings?
[time=2328] They act, says Dio-tima, as interpreters in conveyors of human things to gods, of divine things to men.
[time=2337] They carry the prayers and the sacrifices of men to gods and the commandments of the gods to men and their responses to the sacrifice.
[time=2348] Occupying a place between the two gods and men, they fill up a gap and cause the whole universe to be coherent and whole.
[time=2357] All divination takes place by their means.
[time=2360] The art of priests, the art of sacrifices, and of mystical rites and incantations.
[time=2366] In a word, all divining and magic.
[time=2369] A god has no immediate relationship with a man.
[time=2372] All conversation between the two take place through the demon kind.
[time=2378] Now, that view of demonology was not given to us again by an ignorant person.
[time=2385] The author of the symposium is none other than Plato.
[time=2388] 400 years before the birth of Christ, the Greek mind, believed in a concept of spirit beings called demons, and they recognize that to their idol worship, to their concept of gods, a concept of many gods, there was real power because there were intermediaries that they even themselves would call demons.
[time=2410] That was the power.
[time=2411] That was the life that came through this source.
[time=2414] The Greeks then believed in what we now call as historians, mystery religions.
[time=2420] Names like El-Yusinian mysteries, or Oris, or Dionysius, or Mithra.
[time=2426] These religions were called aesthetic religions.
[time=2429] I have a lengthy quote here, but I will just give you Hox's condensed version from the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics.
[time=2436] And a static religion is one whereby an individual falls under the influence of the gods, as Plato was writing about.
[time=2447] Once a person falls under the influence of God, they would enter into an aesthetic state.
[time=2452] In this aesthetic state, they would prophesy, and they would give messages, or they would speak in languages that were different than their own, or they would speak in languages that no one understood.
[time=2464] Oftentimes, they would fall into a trance, and in that trance, they would do bizarre things with their body.
[time=2470] It was called an aesthetic experience.
[time=2473] Just this line I will use from the quote.
[time=2476] The means to induce this mental rapture are various, and have all been discovered empirically.
[time=2483] For example, the kava drinking of the Polynesians, the inhalation of tobacco by the North American Indians, the use of hashish by the Indian hemp, by some 200 million asiatics and Africans, are the use or abuse of alcohol, the favorite medium of intoxication amongst the white race, and the opium of the Chinese are all uses, artificially, to introduce the state of unconsciousness.
[time=2510] However, it is possible for someone to enter into this aesthetic state by simply doing some form of meditation, some form of self hypnosis, some form of emotionalism, can bring them into an aesthetic state.
[time=2525] Now, that was the religion of the Greeks of that day.
[time=2530] In these aesthetic states, they would make utterances called prophecies.
[time=2534] They would make predictions about the futures.
[time=2536] They would make words of warning, and sometimes they would just say great statements, and people would worship their great statements.
[time=2545] The most famous place that this happened was at a place called Delphi.
[time=2549] There was an oracle of Delphi.
[time=2551] The most famous of all of the priestesses there was a lady by the name of Pythia.
[time=2558] And Pythia would go into her aesthetic state, and she would make great pronunciations that they would then worship.
[time=2565] One of those that she said was to know thyself.
[time=2569] It became the philosophy of Socrates.
[time=2572] That was called a mystery legend of the days of the Greeks.
[time=2577] Let me just give you a quote from Virgil's Aeneid.
[time=2580] Do you remember the story of Aeneid?
[time=2581] Did you have to suffer through that in literature class years ago?
[time=2585] This is an illustration of one sibble.
[time=2588] A sibble was a priestess who had these gifts of a static utterance.
[time=2593] A hundred voices from the rock inside.
[time=2596] Pearl forth, the sibble cries.
[time=2599] So they had reached their threshold, and the maiden cried.
[time=2602] Now is the time to seek the fates and pray.
[time=2605] Behold, behold the God.
[time=2610] And standing there straight way.
[time=2613] Her color and her features changed.
[time=2615] Loose streams, her hair disordered.
[time=2618] Her heart distressed swells with wild frenzy.
[time=2622] Larger now she seems.
[time=2624] Her voice not mortal.
[time=2625] Her voice possessing deity.
[time=2628] Pray Trojans, pray.
[time=2631] Peels her warning in her utterance.
[time=2634] Pray cease not Aeneid nor withhold thy quest.
[time=2638] Now, can you imagine that you're on a ship.
[time=2642] Your ship is going through some rocks, and you don't know whether you can get your ship through that rocks.
[time=2646] And suddenly this woman comes to the very front of the ship.
[time=2650] Her hair starts blowing wild.
[time=2652] It's as though her body is enlarging, her face changes colors, and she starts screaming out.
[time=2658] Go forth Aeneid.
[time=2659] What are you gonna do?
[time=2660] I'm gonna go.
[time=2662] I'd find that intimidating.
[time=2664] Those were the experiences that the Greeks were very used to.
[time=2668] Sometimes they would understand those experiences.
[time=2671] Other times they would not.
[time=2673] Now what does all this have to do with what Paul was saying to 1 Corinthians, chapter 12?
[time=2680] It is simply this.
[time=2682] The Greeks practiced these religious rites that had great personal experience, and they would come together, and they would hope that they themselves would fall into an ecstatic state, and that they themselves might be taken over by the spirit of a God, and then they might speak a word of prophecy, an utterance, or they might make a bold statement, or they might say something that would be remembered forever, or that they might speak in what they would call the languages of the gods that no one else would understand, but they would know that the gods spoke through them.
[time=2720] Now how that all fits together is this.
[time=2723] Now they come to the church of Jesus Christ, and God gave spiritual gifts.
[time=2730] Some of those spiritual gifts were the gifts of prophecy.
[time=2734] Paul had a gift of prophecy.
[time=2736] Agabus in Jerusalem had four daughters who could prophesy.
[time=2739] God had not completed his word, so they didn't have Bible studies.
[time=2744] So God gave to them the gift of prophecy to reveal his word.
[time=2749] God also gave the gift of speaking in tongues.
[time=2754] That gift was used in the day of Pentecost, so that 12 men, literally ignorant men that we would call the disciples, could now communicate to a worldwide gathering of Greeks, of Romans, of Spaniards, of Arabs, of Persians, of Hebrews, of Sumerians, that they knew none of those languages, but God would give them a gift to be able to speak in an unknown language, and they spoke, and every person heard the gospel of Jesus Christ in his or her own language.
[time=2790] God gave a gift that the Bible calls the gift of speaking in tongues.
[time=2795] Now you're in a Corinthian church service, and there are those who are making prophecies.
[time=2801] There are those who are speaking in unknown languages, but there is confusion because some of the people are bringing their paganism into that concept of spiritual gifts, and falling into ecstatic utterances, and making statements, and some are saying, "Is this of God, or is this not of God?" There was great confusion, as a matter of fact, these pagans believed in spiritual powers that were actually real.
[time=2828] For example, in Acts chapter 13, there's a man by the name of Elias, the sorcerer.
[time=2834] This man possessed a gift of magic that came from pagan powers, and he actually could perform magic until he was confronted by the gospel of Jesus Christ, and then he discovered he was powerless.
[time=2849] There was a girl in Acts chapter 16, a maiden who prophesied is what the new international version says.
[time=2854] It said she had a spirit of prophecy.
[time=2858] That word spirit, numa of prophecy, is actually numa pythia, which means a spirit of pythia, the ancient prophetess of the oracle of Delphi.
[time=2868] She was actually getting up and uttering prophecies, but they were not originating in the source of God.
[time=2876] As a matter of fact, Paul and Barnabas were confused as being Jupiter and Apollo.
[time=2886] Back in the book of Acts in Acts chapters 14, verses 11 through 15, it reads this way.
[time=2895] And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lyconyan language, the gods have come down to us in human form.
[time=2906] Barnabas, they called Hermes, or Mercury, or Apollo, because he was the chief speaker.
[time=2913] And Paul, they called Hermes and Barnabas, they called Zeus.
[time=2920] They actually thought this is an ecstatic utterance, and not only is an ecstatic utterance, these men are gods.
[time=2927] Well, FF Bruce is probably the authority of Greek manuscripts who has ever lived.
[time=2933] He was born in 1910, studied during even our generation, and wrote.
[time=2938] FF Bruce says, Paul knew that the phenomena of speaking in tongues in a prophecy could be paralleled in paganism.
[time=2948] What this confusion is, there were different things happening in the Church of Corinth, and the question was, how could this be interpreted?
[time=2957] So Paul now gives a clarification, verse three.
[time=2961] Verse one, concerns.
[time=2963] Verse two, confusions.
[time=2965] Verse three, clarification.
[time=2967] Here is the clarification.
[time=2969] Therefore, I tell you that anyone who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, Jesus be cursed, can't be.
[time=2978] And anyone who says, Jesus is Lord, that can't be unless it's of the Spirit of God.
[time=2985] What was happening was this.
[time=2987] There were those in the Corinthian Church who would stand up, not under the influence of the Spirit of God, but under a different influence of perhaps an emotionally induced aesthetic state, and they would make pronunciations.
[time=3000] And one of those pronunciations was [NON-ENGLISH] which simply means, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3009] They didn't know necessarily what they were saying, because they were in a trance, or maybe they were speaking in a language they didn't know, but they were actually saying, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3018] Now what does that statement, Jesus be a cursed means?
[time=3022] That's three significant things in history.
[time=3025] First of all, in the Old Testament it says in Deuteronomy, cursed is anyone who hangs upon a tree.
[time=3034] Paul quoted that in Galatians 3 when he said, cursed is anyone who hangs upon a tree, and Jesus has become a curse for us.
[time=3044] Now, there were those who were converted to Judaism, some by Paul, and they forced them to blaspheme.
[time=3053] And the way they forced them to blaspheme is they made them say, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3060] So there was rooted in Judaism, a hostility towards Christ, and they would say, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3066] But a second thing happened.
[time=3068] There were Romans who persecuted Christians and forced everyone to worship Caesar as Lord.
[time=3076] And one of the things they demanded was that you deny Christ and say, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3083] Or if not, you would be taken perhaps to the Colosseum, there to be fed the lions, or tortured in some other way, unless you were to say, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3093] Listen to this stirring illustration out of history.
[time=3096] In the time of Trajan, plenty, the governor of Bithynia, tested people's commitment to Christianity, demanding that they curse Jesus.
[time=3108] Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna, was so tested, demanded pro-council Stedius quadratus, say, swearing by the Godhead Caesar and blaspheme Christ.
[time=3125] And Polycarp answered, 80 and six years have I served Christ.
[time=3130] He has never done me wrong.
[time=3132] How can I blaspheme my king, who saved me?
[time=3136] Oh, what a testimony of commitment to Christ that a man can know the death is imminent.
[time=3142] And all that he need due to escape is to say, Jesus be a cursed, but he would say no.
[time=3148] And Polycarp was burned at the stake.
[time=3151] That's what it meant to say Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3153] It was to denounce the God who bought them.
[time=3157] But there's another incident that occurred.
[time=3160] Not only did the Jewish element or the Roman element pressure a denunciation of Christ, there were those who, in a frenzy of a static utterance, thinking that it was the spirit of God, would be making statement after statement, not knowing what they were saying.
[time=3175] And they would actually say, yesus anathema, Jesus be a cursed.
[time=3180] Let me give you some other illustrations of that.
[time=3183] Dr. A. C. Gabbaline reported a ton's speech, which included words in the Chinese dialect, which were too vile and obscene to be repeated, but were able to be interpreted by a missionary who was present.
[time=3196] Another speaker on another occasion was described as blaspheming the Lord Jesus Christ in a most awful manner.
[time=3204] Similar reports have been given by others, including V. Raymond Edmund, former president of Wheaton College, who reported that during their ritual dances, Tibetan monks have spoken in English, concluding speech typical of drunken sailors.
[time=3220] Back then and today, there are those who enter into an emotional state, a frenzy of an ecstatic being.
[time=3228] And they make statements, not knowing what they're saying, but it is actually not Christian, but anti-Christian in its very content.
[time=3238] Paul is simply saying this, no one has ever spoken under the influence of the Spirit of God and has ever said anything to diminish the deity of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3254] And so he gives to them a test, a twofold test, and the first part of that test is negative.
[time=3260] Did they denounce the person of Jesus Christ than it is not of the Spirit of God?
[time=3267] But then he gives to them a positive test.
[time=3270] He says in the same manner, verse three, and no one can say, Jesus is Lord, but by the Spirit of God.
[time=3278] Now you today can say, Jesus is Lord, I can say Jesus is Lord, we can take computers and program them to say Jesus is Lord.
[time=3286] It's not simply the physical ability that under those three words, Jesus is Lord that he's talking about.
[time=3292] Christ clarified that.
[time=3295] Christ said, not everyone who says unto me, Lord, Lord, why enter into my kingdom.
[time=3301] We're then not talking about just a mere verbal profession of someone saying the right words.
[time=3306] We're talking about the ability to, with the heart, to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, that he is Christ.
[time=3315] It is the Holy Spirit that leads us to make that confession that he is Lord.
[time=3321] That word, Lord, Greek curios is the Bible word for the translation of a Hebrew word.
[time=3328] We would call it Jehovah.
[time=3329] The Hebrews would pronounce it Yahweh, although many would not even say the name Yahweh.
[time=3335] It is a four-letter word.
[time=3336] They therefore call it the tetragrammaton, which just means four-letter word.
[time=3341] And the Hebrews would not write it in their Bible without then disposing of the pin because it was such a sacred name.
[time=3348] It was the very name for God himself.
[time=3350] It would not be used to describe false gods.
[time=3353] This name for Lord would describe God alone.
[time=3356] And Paul is saying, Jesus is God and God alone.
[time=3361] That was the confession.
[time=3364] They actually say that Jesus Christ is God.
[time=3369] There were those in that day who denied that.
[time=3372] They believed that God came to Jesus at his baptism and then left Jesus at his crucifixion.
[time=3378] And that Jesus only had the spirit of God temporarily upon him that Christ was God, but Jesus was not.
[time=3385] You say that's strange, but that's the very description of many cults today.
[time=3390] Many of those who claim to know Christ are actually saying he really wasn't God.
[time=3394] But they actually say that Jesus is God is the leading of the spirit, that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3401] Do you know that he's Lord today?
[time=3404] Do you know that he's Lord of your life, that he's Lord of all this universe, the great black pastor, Shadrach, Meshach, Lockridge said this.
[time=3412] God didn't need to sow his laundry mark in the lapel of the meadow, he owns them.
[time=3420] And God didn't need to sign his signature to the sunset.
[time=3423] He owns it.
[time=3425] And God didn't need the chisels and niches into the sides of the majestic mountains, he owns them.
[time=3432] God didn't have to put his brand on the cattle of a thousand hills, he owns them, and he owns you, and he owns me.
[time=3442] And when that great black pastor said that, my heart leaped and said, "By God's grace he does own me." And can you confess that today, that Jesus Christ is Lord?
[time=3453] I don't mean can you say words, but have you given your heart to him, that he is Lord, that he owns you, that you belong to him?
[time=3462] Beloved, you'll never make that discovery.
[time=3464] You'll never be able to make that proclamation unless the Spirit of God convicts your heart that you're a sinner in need of a Savior.
[time=3472] Beloved, we don't have to listen to today, the very Spirit of God can convict you of your sin.
[time=3476] You know within the depth of your being.
[time=3479] And then the Spirit of God can convict you of righteousness that God cannot look upon your sin or mind with acceptance.
[time=3487] And then he can convict you of judgment, that if you don't believe in Christ, there is an awful judgment ahead.
[time=3495] The Spirit of God can lead you to say, "Lord Jesus, I do believe that you died for my sins.
[time=3502] I want you to come into my heart.
[time=3504] I want you to be my Savior and to say, Jesus is Lord." (gentle music)
