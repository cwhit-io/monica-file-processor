[time=23] One man out of his heart of mercy says we've got to do something to help these people.
[time=27] Let's do something right now.
[time=30] Another man says, no, wait a minute.
[time=31] We've got to organize this.
[time=33] We just can't go giving money away here, there.
[time=35] We've got to have a plan.
[time=37] Who's right?
[time=38] How are we going to solve this?
[time=41] We can solve it by applying the principle of una diversity.
[time=46] [MUSIC]
[time=51] >> Good morning and welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=57] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of this Lord's Day with us.
[time=61] Today, Pastor Rick's message is taken from 1 Corinthians, chapter 12, and is entitled "The Body of Christ." Today's message is the next in the series on the topic of spiritual gifts.
[time=72] Rick has coined the word una diversity to describe how spiritual gifts work in the body of Christ.
[time=79] So that you're able to study with us.
[time=81] Please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians, chapter 12.
[time=86] We will be looking at verses 4 through 20.
[time=89] Special music for today's service will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir, singing a song entitled "We Are His Hands" from their new album.
[time=97] We'll also be hearing from Susan Toyrac and Kathy Hawks, and the Men's Singers Quartet.
[time=104] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=113] It is our prayer that the Lord will speak to you through today's message.
[time=117] And now, here's Pastor Rick.
[time=119] - The Baptist Church, we're delighted that you're here with us, joining us for the Bible Hour and for this morning worship service.
[time=127] Thank you for joining with us, and we trust that God will use this hour today to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and to build us up together in Him.
[time=137] We're a body, the Apostle Paul said, the body of Christ.
[time=140] Some of you are hands, others of you are feet.
[time=143] Some of us are ears, or eyes.
[time=145] Some of us are elbows that give mobility, but we're all part of the body of Christ and to serve Him.
[time=151] We are His hands.
[time=153] We are His feet.
[time=154] We are children of the Lord, united together in one body.
[time=158] Our choir leads us in that devotional song that reminds us that we are His hands, we are His feet.

[time=1250] (audience applauding)
[time=1263] - Thank you, man, and I hope that you know that there is one that cares for you in the world that may go too fast some days, may leave you out.
[time=1272] A world that may overwhelm you are.
[time=1275] Worse a friend that may abandon you.
[time=1278] There's one that you can go to.
[time=1280] Let's go to him now.
[time=1282] God, we come to you today because we know that there's no one else who cares for us like you do.
[time=1290] There's no one else who has the ability to work in our lives like you do.
[time=1295] And God, we sense today that you alone are our refuge.
[time=1300] As Luther wrote, a mighty fortress is our God.
[time=1303] God, we view you today as that citadel, that place of fortification from the storms of life.
[time=1311] And God, we pray that you would implant a word of joy into the hearts of those whose circumstances are indeed not joyful.
[time=1320] You pray for those today who are battling cancer, like Catherine Northrop or Harry Blossard or Golden Miller, that today you would strengthen their heart, that you would give them an eternal hope in the midst of a great battle.
[time=1334] God, we pray today for those who are facing surgeries like Lloyd Hicks in the days ahead, that you would be the comfort and the stability of his life.
[time=1344] God, I pray particularly for those who live with the bitter sting of rejection that their wife or their husband has said, I've got a better plan for my life than the plan of marriage that God's designed and they've been abandoned.
[time=1361] Oh, God, today, give a sense of worth to that one who's been rejected and a vision for their life in the days ahead.
[time=1370] God, thank you that you're a rebuilder and that you're a quipper.
[time=1373] God, today, equip us now as we study your word.
[time=1377] For Jesus' sake and in his name we pray, amen.
[time=1382] I think competition is an undeniable part of human life.
[time=1388] Do you remember the old Kenilration commercials as these kids were talking about their dogs and one little guy says, my dog's better than your dog, my dog's better than yours, my dog's better because he eats Kenilration, my dog's better than yours.
[time=1401] And then a little girl chimes in, well, my dog's faster than your dog, my dog's faster than yours.
[time=1406] There's something about us as human beings that are undeniably competitive.
[time=1411] Whether we're children or adults, whether we're talking about physical things are spiritual things.
[time=1417] And spiritual gifts has a tremendous ability to become very, very competitive.
[time=1423] To say, my gift's better than your gift, my gift's better than yours because my gift happens to be public.
[time=1430] Yours is private.
[time=1432] Or my gift's so good that if you don't have my gift and you're probably really not even a part of the body of Christ.
[time=1438] You know, we've gotten together and we've studied and we've decided unless everybody here has this gift then you really don't belong.
[time=1444] Competitive.
[time=1447] It's part of the human nature and I'm guilty of it.
[time=1450] But you know, there are things that God has given us, beloved not to compete but to actually compliment.
[time=1458] And sometimes God says I've given this person, this gift and this person a completely different gift so that when they team up together, they literally compliment each other.
[time=1469] But somehow the old nature can creep in there and become competitive.
[time=1472] Well, we really ought to do it the way my gift will function better.
[time=1476] You know, I really believe God gave us husbands and wives not simply to be partners but to be supplementers to each other.
[time=1484] My wife and I are very, very different.
[time=1488] That difference is really complimentary.
[time=1492] I am somewhat of a morning person.
[time=1495] Some days I set my alarm for 505 and I sit there and wait for it to go off.
[time=1501] At 8.30 at night, I'm gone.
[time=1503] You know, if you're talking to me at 8.30 at night, you better talk fast 'cause your time's just about up.
[time=1509] Kathy's a night person.
[time=1510] She starts moving faster at 8.30.
[time=1513] Kathy is a very empathetic person.
[time=1516] One of our kids falls down and gets hurt.
[time=1519] She runs to their side and with her empathy she puts her arms around them and says, "Honey, it'll be okay.
[time=1525] "I am a very authority type person.
[time=1527] "I run to 'em and say, "How many times have I told you not to run on wet floors?" (audience laughs) You see this?
[time=1533] Wet floor, your running is gonna happen.
[time=1534] You might as well either learn not to cry or learn not to run.
[time=1537] What's it gonna be?
[time=1538] (audience laughs) Great compassion.
[time=1541] You think that's funny.
[time=1543] You voted me to be your compassionate pastor.
[time=1546] (audience laughs) But you know, we're all very different, aren't we?
[time=1550] She possesses extraordinary gifts of mercy and compassion and empathy and tenderness.
[time=1556] I possess different philosophies.
[time=1560] I'm more of a driver.
[time=1561] You know what a compliment that comes.
[time=1565] You know, if there were two Kathy's and our marriage, our kids would be the most comforted bruised bodies in America.
[time=1571] And if I was there, they wouldn't have a bruise on their body and they wouldn't care that you did.
[time=1577] You know, well, that's obsessive to say that everybody's gotta be this way.
[time=1581] Oh, God brings balance into a marriage, doesn't he?
[time=1584] I'm so glad he did.
[time=1586] God brings balance into a church by diversity, diversity of spiritual gifts.
[time=1592] But yet there's that competitive part that says, I understand that we need the rest of you, but I really don't think we need the rest of you as much as we need me.
[time=1600] And this thing would really go a lot better if you would all just do it my way and use my gifts.
[time=1607] And I'm really suspicious that you don't even have this gift.
[time=1610] And I really think that if you were spiritual, you'd possess this gift, this gift, and this gift.
[time=1614] Oh, beloved, that's not a new song.
[time=1616] That was what was happening in Corinth.
[time=1618] And Paul writes a word from the very spirit of God that gave gifts to give instruction.
[time=1624] Would you open to the book of 1 Corinthians and we are studying through chapters 12, 13, and 14 as they deal about spiritual gifts?
[time=1634] Let me go back to something we said two weeks ago.
[time=1637] Paul said, I would not have you to be ignorant brethren.
[time=1642] By that, Paul wanted two things to happen.
[time=1644] One, he wanted them to grow in their knowledge.
[time=1647] He didn't want them to forever remain ignorant spiritually, always scratching their head.
[time=1653] He wanted them to know, but he also wanted them to remain as brothers.
[time=1657] Now, there are those today who are brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ who will take a differing view of spiritual gifts than I will take.
[time=1665] I recognize them as brothers and sisters, and I trust and I know that they recognize me as a brother in Christ, yet we will differ.
[time=1673] But let us endeavor, though we will teach, and we will teach with authority, that we recognize that though they are maybe differences, they are still one body, and they are part of the body of Christ.
[time=1685] Now, we come to verses four through 20, and it starts to speak about the principle of unit diversity.
[time=1692] You've never heard that word before, and I checked it's not in the dictionary.
[time=1696] I made that up, but I think it will help us today to understand what God is teaching here in a word, una diversity.
[time=1704] Chapter 12, verse four.
[time=1706] There are different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit.
[time=1712] There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
[time=1717] There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.
[time=1724] Now, to each one, the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good.
[time=1731] To one is given through the spirit, the message of wisdom.
[time=1736] To another, a message of knowledge by means of the same spirit.
[time=1741] To another faith by the same spirit.
[time=1745] To another gifts of healing by that one spirit.
[time=1749] To another miraculous powers.
[time=1751] To another prophecy.
[time=1754] To another, the ability to distinguish between spirits.
[time=1758] To another, the ability to speak in different kinds of tongues.
[time=1763] And still, another, the interpretation of tongues.
[time=1768] All these are the work of one and the same spirit.
[time=1773] And he gives them to each one just as he determines.
[time=1779] The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts.
[time=1784] And through all its parts are many, though all of its parts are many, they form one body, so it is with Christ.
[time=1794] For we were all baptized by one spirit into one body, whether Jew or Greek or slave or free.
[time=1805] And we were all given one spirit to drink.
[time=1809] Now the body is not made up of one part, but of many.
[time=1814] If the foot should say, because I am not a hand,
[time=1820] I do not belong to the body, would it not, would it for that reason, cease to be a part of the body?
[time=1828] And if the ear should say, because I'm not an eye, I do not belong to the body, it would not for that reason, cease to be a part of the body.
[time=1839] If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[time=1850] But in fact, God has arranged the parts of the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
[time=1857] If they were all one part, where would the body be?
[time=1863] As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
[time=1866] As we read this passage of scripture, we come to the Apostle Paul's teaching on spiritual gifts and their unity and their diversity.
[time=1877] Different spiritual gifts, yet the same spirit, unidiversity, but before we get into that, let's take a moment and talk about what is a spiritual gift.
[time=1887] In these verses that we've looked at, he uses five different words to describe spiritual gifts.
[time=1894] The first one is found back in verse one of chapter 12.
[time=1897] It says this, now concerning spirituals.
[time=1901] If you're using a King James Bible today, it will say spiritual gifts, but your word gifts will be an italics because that is not a part of the original.
[time=1910] There's just an adjective.
[time=1912] And the Greeks allow you to just use an adjective, but in English, you can't just have an adjective, you have to have a noun.
[time=1919] So our translator supplied the word gifts and that's fair.
[time=1923] But it is saying now concerning spirituals.
[time=1927] The emphasis is that these are spiritual gifts.
[time=1930] And when we talk about a spiritual gift, we're distinguishing the spiritual gift from the natural gift and the acquired gift.
[time=1940] We talked a little bit last Sunday night, but many of you were not there.
[time=1943] There are natural talents, natural gifts that God has given.
[time=1947] Some of you have a musical ability that you were born with.
[time=1951] Somebody can walk over and play a note on the piano and some of you can just hum that note.
[time=1957] Some of you can not only hum that note, you can say that's a sharp and you're absolutely right.
[time=1967] Some of us hear that note and say, was that a piano?
[time=1973] We don't have music in us.
[time=1976] God didn't give us that ability.
[time=1978] Others of you, boy, you can just name those notes and you can repeat them right back.
[time=1983] That's your natural ability.
[time=1984] I don't have that natural ability.
[time=1986] Some of us have natural athletic ability.
[time=1990] Some of us have an energy level and a metabolism level and we have natural eye hand coordination that some of us can go out and play a sport for the very first time, five minutes into it, we can perform it very great.
[time=2003] Others of us have a very difficult time walking and chewing gum at the same moment.
[time=2008] Well, that's natural.
[time=2009] God gave some music.
[time=2010] He gave some natural gifts in other areas.
[time=2014] Now, other than natural gifts, there are acquired gifts.
[time=2018] Some of you have acquired a talent with computers that you understand all these different computer languages and these volumes of pages come off and you enroll them across the ground and they all make sense to you.
[time=2034] Others of us say, could you please just give us the bottom line?
[time=2039] Because all these sheets, I don't understand.
[time=2042] You've acquired that gift.
[time=2045] Others of us have not acquired that gift.
[time=2048] But standing in contra distinction to natural and acquired gifts are spiritual gifts.
[time=2056] You didn't have those gifts when you were born and you did nothing to learn them, to develop them.
[time=2062] God simply said, I'm gonna give you a spiritual gift and I'm gonna give you one and I'm gonna give you one.
[time=2067] I'm gonna give each of you a spiritual gift that you weren't born with.
[time=2071] You didn't go to seminary to receive it.
[time=2072] You didn't go to a seminar to learn how you can grab it.
[time=2075] I'm giving it to you.
[time=2076] It's spiritual.
[time=2078] There's a second word that is used down in verse four.
[time=2083] It says this, there are different kinds of gifts.
[time=2088] That's not a simple word for gift.
[time=2090] It's a compound word, charasmata from which we get the concept of charismatic gifts.
[time=2095] It simply means it is a grace gift.
[time=2098] That means God gives it to you without anything that you've done to earn it or deserve it.
[time=2105] God just says, here's a gift for you.
[time=2106] Here's a gift for you.
[time=2109] It's not that you've been a believer this long.
[time=2110] Therefore, after five years of service as a Christian, you get this gift and after 15 years, you get two more gifts.
[time=2118] No, God just says by grace, I give them.
[time=2121] There's a third word that is used in verse five.
[time=2123] It says there are different kinds of service.
[time=2126] From this word, we get our English word deacon.
[time=2129] It means one who serves.
[time=2131] And the emphasis then is on a spiritual gift is not given for self edification, but for the ability to edify, that means to build up the rest.
[time=2140] That if I've been given a gift, and if you've been given a gift, that gift was not given for you, but it's given for the whole body, to serve one another.
[time=2149] Then there's a fourth word.
[time=2150] It says in verse five, there are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
[time=2154] Then there are different kinds of working.
[time=2157] The Greek word there gives us the English word energy.
[time=2162] That God not only gives you a gift, and that gift allows you to serve, but with that talent comes the powered exercise.
[time=2170] Take yourself back eight months to last Christmas.
[time=2174] Do you remember how much money you spent that you shouldn't have on children's toys?
[time=2179] You bought your son or your daughter this little gadget, and it's supposed to go up and down, and in and out, and make noises, and chime, and all those things, and you opened up the box, or they opened up the box, they said it there, and you said, now let daddy show you how to work, and it didn't work because on the very bottom, it said, batteries, not included.
[time=2198] And the whole thing was worthless.
[time=2201] It was a great gift, but it didn't function because it had no power.
[time=2205] God said, I not only give you the gift, but I'll give you the power.
[time=2209] There is not going to be a gift that God gives that doesn't have with it, residing with that gift, the ability to function.
[time=2217] Then there is a fifth word.
[time=2220] It is this, it is found in verse seven.
[time=2222] Now to each one, the manifestation of the spirit is given.
[time=2226] That word manifest, if you'll just look it up from our friend Webster, the word manifest simply means to make aware by sensory perception.
[time=2236] It means to take that which may not be otherwise seen or heard manifest.
[time=2243] It means that you can now see it.
[time=2245] You can hear it, or you can smell it, or you can touch it, but by your empirical skills of senses, it's now available.
[time=2253] What this is saying is that God gives a spiritual gift.
[time=2256] That spiritual gift is for the service of the body of Christ.
[time=2259] It has energy, and when that energy is used, you say, I see that.
[time=2266] I understand from your gift of teaching.
[time=2268] Now I understand, or through your gift of helps.
[time=2271] I see the spirit of God working, or through your gift of mercy.
[time=2274] I see the spirit of God, or through your gift of leadership.
[time=2277] I see the spirit of God.
[time=2279] Spiritual gift then is five things.
[time=2281] One, it's spiritual.
[time=2282] Two, it is a gift.
[time=2284] Three, it is a service.
[time=2286] Fourth is a power, and fifth is a demonstration of the spirit of God.
[time=2292] That's what a spiritual gift is.
[time=2294] Now, the problem was, there were those saying, I think that this spiritual gift should be owned and possessed by everybody else, and everybody who doesn't have this gift, I'm not even sure they're a part of the body of Christ.
[time=2310] And so I've coined a phrase if you'll let me the unit diversity of the gifts, because in these verses, it tells us a great deal about the unity of the gifts, but it also tells us about the diversity of the gifts.
[time=2325] Look at verses 4, 5, and 6, and you'll discover that they're different.
[time=2331] Verse 4, there are different kinds of gifts.
[time=2346] Now Paul is being overly repetitive here, but he has to drive home to them and to us that spiritual gifts are very, very different, that one spiritual gift may be completely different than another spiritual gift, that they're not the same.
[time=2362] And he repeats it again, and again, and again to get that emphasis.
[time=2368] You know, it's amazing how repetition is such a good teacher.
[time=2371] It communicates so clearly.
[time=2374] We were on vacation in Florida, and Steve and I had played golf together.
[time=2378] We got rained out, and I had a rain pass left.
[time=2381] And so I went golfing one day by myself, and I had a cart.
[time=2385] You had to take a cart down there.
[time=2386] So I said, well, I'll risk it.
[time=2388] I'll take Adam, my three-year-old, along with me.
[time=2390] He's a good little boy.
[time=2391] He'll sit in the cart.
[time=2392] You know, he didn't get out of the cart, but we had some serious problems that day.
[time=2397] I stepped back from the ball, and I took a practice swing.
[time=2400] Took another practice swing, then I addressed the ball.
[time=2402] And just as I got my back swing back, he said, dad, you missed.
[time=2407] So I stepped back from the ball.
[time=2409] I said, no, son, that's called a practice swing.
[time=2412] I stepped back up the ball, and he said, dad, you missed.
[time=2415] You missed, dad.
[time=2416] Dad, you missed.
[time=2418] For four holes, every time I picked up a golf club, he said, dad, you missed.
[time=2424] And I said, Adam, if you say that I missed again, we're going back.
[time=2429] He said, OK, dad, dad, you missed.
[time=2434] I want you to know something for the rest of that golf round.
[time=2438] I couldn't hit that ball without looking up for that little guy to say, dad, you missed.
[time=2442] We haven't been golfing in months together.
[time=2448] But you know that repetition made me realize that there was somebody there who was going to say something.
[time=2456] Paul is saying it again and again and again to the point where he wants you to look up and say, I think the gifts are different.
[time=2465] Because so many people don't understand that simple point that the gifts are all different.
[time=2471] We're not all going to have the same gift.
[time=2475] They're different.
[time=2476] You missed that.
[time=2477] OK, you got that?
[time=2478] They're different gifts.
[time=2479] But if you didn't get that, then in verses 8 through 10, he gives us a random sample illustrating the different gifts.
[time=2487] Now, I say a random sample because he lists nine gifts here.
[time=2491] But if you turn to Romans chapter 12, or you read later on in this listing in 1 Corinthians 12, or if you turn to Ephesians 4, you'll discover that there are more gifts than these nine.
[time=2502] They're 18 or 19.
[time=2505] But let me read this list of nine gifts.
[time=2507] He says there's wisdom.
[time=2509] But there's a different gift of knowledge.
[time=2512] There's faith, but there's a different gift of healing and a different gift of miraculous powers and still a different gift of prophecy.
[time=2520] And yet a completely different gift, the ability to distinguish between spirits.
[time=2525] And yet another gift, the ability to speak in an unknown language.
[time=2529] And yet a different gift, the ability to interpret when someone else is speaking in those unknown languages.
[time=2537] So he says, you see, they're different.
[time=2540] And those differences are very, very needed.
[time=2543] Because based upon our differences, we then function together in that teamwork.
[time=2550] For example, we may receive a letter that says, please help us in Timbuktu.
[time=2559] The people here are hungry to know the Lord, but we don't have enough resources to get the word out.
[time=2564] And many of them are underfed and under clothed.
[time=2567] We must have help soon.
[time=2570] Now somebody's going to stand up and they have the gift of mercy.
[time=2575] And they're going to say, oh, my heart.
[time=2578] It breaks.
[time=2580] Here are people who want to know Christ and who don't even have food.
[time=2584] And we've got to send them food.
[time=2586] And instantly they're saying, let's do something right now.
[time=2589] And they start organizing a ship to get the Timbuktu
[time=2595] out of that heart of mercy.
[time=2598] Somebody else is going to be in that same meeting.
[time=2601] They don't have the gift of mercy.
[time=2603] They've got the gift of administration.
[time=2606] They're going to say, no, wait a moment.
[time=2609] Wait a moment.
[time=2610] I have seven letters here from seven different missionaries, from seven different continents that all are desperate for financial funds.
[time=2619] You can't take everything and send it to them.
[time=2622] We've got to meet all these people's needs.
[time=2626] Let's slow down and get organized here.
[time=2629] And what we need to do is we've got to do this first, then this second, then this third, then this 16, then this 17th, then this 32nd, and the guy at the gift of mercy says, and then the Lord Jesus will come back and will never do a thing.
[time=2643] You see those different gifts?
[time=2645] One's got the gift of mercy, and he just wants to meet that need right now because he cares so deeply.
[time=2650] Well, it's not that this man or woman doesn't care as deeply.
[time=2654] This person just simply says, before you launch the ship, we ought to make sure we've got enough fuel to get there that somebody knows how to sell a ship, administration.
[time=2665] Somebody else has got the gift of faith.
[time=2668] They say, I don't want to hear about all this budget stuff and capital fundraising drive and cash flow.
[time=2674] I just believe God wants Black Hawk Baptist Church to build a new sanctuary.
[time=2678] And I just think we ought to do that.
[time=2681] And somebody else says, amen.
[time=2682] And now you know who the two people with the gift of faith are, the one who said it and the one who said amen.
[time=2689] Somebody else is going to have the gift of leadership.
[time=2691] And they're going to say, no, wait a minute.
[time=2693] I want that building as much as this guy wants that building.
[time=2697] But if we're going to have that building, it'll be by God's grace.
[time=2701] And we've got a plan.
[time=2703] We've got to organize.
[time=2704] We've got to establish a framework in design.
[time=2708] The guy at the gift of faith says, I just read the book of Nehemiah.
[time=2711] And I never read about cash flow one time.
[time=2714] I think we ought to just do what Nehemiah didn't say.
[time=2717] Rise up and build.
[time=2718] And that guy goes home and gets his hammer.
[time=2719] And he's going to build it today.
[time=2722] The guy at the gift of leadership says, oh my.
[time=2725] We're pouring concrete.
[time=2726] And he shows up with a hammer.
[time=2728] Bless his heart.
[time=2731] But he has the gift of faith.
[time=2733] Who's more important?
[time=2735] Neither of them are more important.
[time=2736] The body of Christ needs both of them.
[time=2740] Some of you have got the gift of evangelism.
[time=2745] And you don't meet somebody that you don't think about that person, whether they really know Christ.
[time=2750] And you're heart aches because you're talking to someone who, if they were to die that day, would spend eternity without Christ.
[time=2758] And you just can't get anything through your head but that gift of evangelism.
[time=2764] Somebody else, though, has the gift of teaching.
[time=2768] And they may not lead people to Christ as often as you do, but they're teaching them the whole counsel of God's Word.
[time=2775] And you may be frustrated with them saying, you know that guy has been teaching here for four weeks and nobody, but nobody has gotten saved.
[time=2784] He may be looked at you and say, bless Fred's heart.
[time=2787] He leads somebody different to Christ every day.
[time=2789] And we never see him the day after.
[time=2792] Who's more important, that one who wins or that one who teaches?
[time=2797] They're both needed.
[time=2798] You know, there are teachers.
[time=2800] Those men and women who take God's Word, and they're very thorough, and they're very systematic, and they've cross-referenced everything.
[time=2808] And they probably have the gift of charts that they've got everything boiled down into a chart.
[time=2813] And they may be like Ken Nichols.
[time=2815] They can alliterate a grocery list.
[time=2817] You know, they've got point A, B, C, sub points, A, B.
[time=2821] And I mean, it's all there.
[time=2822] Outline perfect.
[time=2823] They're teachers.
[time=2825] Some of us are teachers.
[time=2826] Others of us are exhorters.
[time=2828] The teacher says, here's the three things I want you to know, the exhorter says, here's what you need to know, but I don't care if you forget it, as long as you do these three things.
[time=2837] Now, what's the church need?
[time=2840] An exhorter or a teacher?
[time=2841] Well, if all you have is teaching, this church may still be seven families.
[time=2847] That started it back in 1969.
[time=2849] You need that exhorter who's gonna challenge the body to move.
[time=2854] But if all you have is that exhorter, they're gonna move and not know where they've been or where they're going, and they'll just keep moving.
[time=2861] And anybody who says move, they'll just move.
[time=2864] You see that God's given diversity because the body of Christ desperately needs that diversity.
[time=2872] But yet within that statement of great diversity, there is even a greater statement about unity.
[time=2880] Look at verse four.
[time=2881] There are different kinds of gifts, but now the same spirit.
[time=2888] Verse five, there are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
[time=2893] There are different kinds of workings, but the same God.
[time=2898] He's going to make three statements that focus in on unity.
[time=2902] The first is the unity of the source.
[time=2906] Whether you serve and you've got power and you've got gifts, it all comes from God.
[time=2912] It's God who gave this guy the gift of exhortation and this lady, the gift of teaching.
[time=2917] It's God who gave her faith, and this one over here, the gift of giving.
[time=2921] It's God who gave this woman the gift of leadership and this man a gift of leadership.
[time=2925] It comes from the same source.
[time=2936] Don't ever forget that.
[time=2937] Your gift may be different than this person's gift, but they come from the same source.
[time=2944] And he even further illustrates that by alluding to the three different personalities of the Trinity.
[time=2951] The same spirit, that's the Holy Spirit.
[time=2953] The same Lord, that's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2956] The same God, that's God the Father.
[time=2957] And he's saying, if God can be singular, yet plural, then the gifts can be diversified, yet unified.
[time=2965] And then as he gives us that random sample, if you'll notice in verses eight through 10, as he lifts those spiritual gifts, verse eight says, "Through the Spirit." Verse eight, "By means of the same Spirit." Verse nine, "By the same Spirit." Verse nine again, "By that one Spirit," verse 11, "of that one insane Spirit." What's he saying there?
[time=2998] He's saying that all this diversity comes from one united source.
[time=3003] Second way he teaches the principle of unity is from the unity of purpose.
[time=3009] Look at verse seven.
[time=3011] Now to each one, the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
[time=3017] That means if God gives me a spiritual gift and that spiritual gift is a mind of giving and God gives you a spiritual gift and that is a mind of faith that he's given me giving and new faith for what?
[time=3031] For me, no, your gift for you, no.
[time=3034] It's for the common good.
[time=3036] The whole diversity is for the common good.
[time=3039] And so God gave different gifts for one unified purpose, the body of Christ.
[time=3044] And then there's not only the unity of the source and then the unity of the purpose, but there's the unity of the recipients.
[time=3052] Verse seven again says, "Now to each one, "the manifestation of the Spirit is given." God says, "I'm so united you "that I'm giving every person gifts.
[time=3064] "Each one, not some, but each one.
[time=3067] "Therefore, every one of us is united together "because we all are needed." It's not that God says, "I'm gonna give some of these people spiritual gifts "and then they will run the church, "or they will be the resources." Every one of us were united because we're all mutually dependent upon each other.
[time=3086] Now to illustrate that principle of unit diversity, he gives us the illustration in verses 12 through 20 of a body.
[time=3095] You don't have to be a genius to understand that the body is made up of many parts, more parts than we probably could number if we spent the day.
[time=3104] Eyes, ears, noses, fingers, fingernails, knees, elbows, cartilage, muscle, blood cells, blood corpuscles, capillaries, arteries, veins, organs like liver, spleen, they're all different.
[time=3120] There aren't any organs that can be taken and substituted.
[time=3125] God couldn't say, "Well, I'm running a little short on pancreasas today, "so I'm just gonna give you a third ear "and that'll make up for it." That ear won't digest that food.
[time=3135] Oh, they're all different.
[time=3138] And out of that illustration in verses 12 through the rest of that chapter, for the most part, he begins to illustrate something.
[time=3147] But before he can illustrate it, he has to teach a doctrine, and that's found in verse 13.
[time=3152] Let me read it for you.
[time=3154] For we were all baptized by one spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, we were all given one spirit to drink.
[time=3167] Now, he is saying just as your body is all one.
[time=3173] All these different organs and parts are one, so also the body of Christ is one.
[time=3181] And he uses a critical word here, it is the word all.
[time=3187] Now, you can't say all means every human being because the book of Corinthians wasn't written to humanity, it was written to Christians.
[time=3194] But you have to say he means all Christians.
[time=3196] And you can't say no, he only meant spiritual Christians because the Corinthians were the most carnal Christians of all the New Testament churches.
[time=3204] And he says to that group of carnal people, you all were placed into the body of Christ.
[time=3210] Now, we think of the word baptism as having something to do with water.
[time=3216] It actually means to dip or to place into.
[time=3219] And what it's saying is the Spirit of God takes us up, picks us up and places us into the body of Christ.
[time=3226] Now, who does that happen to?
[time=3228] It happens to every believer.
[time=3231] It is not a second spiritual climax in your life.
[time=3236] There are those that teach and while we love them, I believe they are wrong.
[time=3240] They teach that you accept Christ here.
[time=3242] And then at some later date, you find the fullness of the Spirit when you're baptized by the Spirit.
[time=3248] This Bible says all have been baptized by the Spirit of God.
[time=3252] That means every one of you's been placed in the body of God.
[time=3255] But it also says we've all been made to drink of one's Spirit.
[time=3259] That's an interesting analogy.
[time=3261] What he's saying is you're taken and you're placed into the body of Christ and into the realm of the spirituals, but the very Spirit of God then is brought in you when you drink of it.
[time=3271] That's the indwelling.
[time=3272] That means the day you accept Christ, two things happen, more than that.
[time=3275] But one thing is you're placed into his body and secondly, his Spirit's placed into you.
[time=3280] Now based upon that, then we're all one body.
[time=3284] If baptism doesn't happen to salvation, then we're not one body.
[time=3287] We're two bodies.
[time=3289] There are those who are the body of Christ having been baptized and they're those on the outside who haven't been baptized yet, but somehow they're part of the fragmented body.
[time=3299] That's not at all what this is teaching.
[time=3301] This is teaching just the opposite.
[time=3302] Okay.
[time=3305] Now based upon that, he teaches some principles that go from the body to the spiritual body of Christ.
[time=3314] The first principle that he teaches is this one.
[time=3317] You are a part of the body.
[time=3320] No matter what your function is, you're a part of the body.
[time=3322] If the ear says, "Oh, I'd rather be an eye." And since I'm not an eye, I'm not a part of this body.
[time=3329] It's still part of this body.
[time=3332] You're a part of the body.
[time=3333] No matter what your gift is, no matter how good or how poorly you use it or exercise it, you're a part of the body.
[time=3341] Principle number two is this.
[time=3343] You're necessary.
[time=3344] Look at verse 17.
[time=3346] If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[time=3351] Every one of us is necessary.
[time=3354] Yes, this person may be more visible and I have to admit that my eyes are more essential to my normal functioning than my toes, but I need those toes.
[time=3365] I don't have good balance without those toes.
[time=3368] Everything is necessary.
[time=3371] Third thing he tries to teach out this illustration of the body is that you are what you are by the design of God.
[time=3377] Look at verse 18.
[time=3378] But in fact, God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
[time=3386] I think it's human nature that all of us want to be something different.
[time=3390] Confession.
[time=3391] I wish that I was, oh, six, three or six, four.
[time=3396] And I shot baskets at a downward angle, but I'm not.
[time=3401] I also wish that I could sing.
[time=3403] I mean, I don't mean sing great.
[time=3405] I mean, I just wish that I could sing, but I can't.
[time=3409] You know, there are days that I wish that I had a gift of faith because I'm a realist of the first order.
[time=3414] And I wish I just believed everything was gonna go.
[time=3417] The other days that I wish I had the gifts of leadership and administration.
[time=3422] I make lists and then lose them.
[time=3423] But no matter who you are, you are what you are by the very design of God for your life.
[time=3429] You've been listening to the special music
[time=3440] from our church musicians, Susan Toyrak and Kathy Hawks, and the men's singers, our men's quartet.
[time=3447] You also heard the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3451] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray.
[time=3454] And I'd like you to bow your heads and pray with me if you've never received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3460] Will you bow and pray with me right now?
[time=3462] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3470] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3475] I ask you to come in today, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
