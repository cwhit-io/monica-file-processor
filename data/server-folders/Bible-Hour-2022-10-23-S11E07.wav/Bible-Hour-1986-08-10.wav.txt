[time=105] Without a doubt, she was one of the greatest achievements and greatest tragedies of modern science.
[time=113] The space shuttle Challenger was equipped with over 2,000 sensors and data detectors to tell NASA if anything was going wrong with the rocket.
[time=124] Those sensors and detectors were scattered throughout the craft, but there was one small little o-ring, only a quarter of an inch thick that failed to do its job.
[time=135] It was an indispensable part and each of us are part of the body of Christ and were indispensable.
[time=145] [MUSIC]
[time=151] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. We're glad you've joined us.
[time=158] Today, Rick will be continuing his series on spiritual gifts with a message taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 12 entitled Indispensable Parts.
[time=168] Did you know that you are a vital, indispensable part of the church, the body of Christ?
[time=174] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, where we'll be looking at verses 21 through 31.
[time=186] Music this morning will be provided by our special guest Gospel recording artist Johnny Hall.
[time=192] Johnny will also be with us for an entire concert tonight at 6 p.m.
[time=201] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=211] It is our prayer that the Lord will speak to you through today's worship service.
[time=216] Now, here's Pastor Rick.
[time=218] Welcome you to the Bible Hour and to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and it's our prayer today that God would use this service to strengthen each of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=230] You're indispensable today, and not just today, but every day, you're a part of the body of Christ, his church, and he says that he has a vital plan and a vital use for each of us.
[time=242] Our gifts, our talents, our prayers, our energies, every one of us are needed.
[time=247] God's privilege us today with having someone whose gifts and talents have been dedicated to the Lord through the ministry of music.
[time=255] We've asked Johnny Hall to be with us today, both in this service and in our evening service, to encourage us with God's Word, and we want to welcome him today.
[time=264] Some mornings were a little too formal, some other days were a little too relaxed, but there's a way that we can let a friend know that we're glad he's here.
[time=271] Would you join me in welcoming Johnny Hall as our guest today?
[time=284] It was in my darkness when Jesus found me, there he touched my eyes and he made me see.
[time=295] Then he broke since chains that long had bound me, and he gave me life and liberty.
[time=307] An all glorious love of Christ, my Lord divine, that would make him stoop to save the soul of mine.
[time=319] Through all my days and then in heaven above.
[time=325] Through all my soul, my silence never, and I am worshiping him forever and praising for his glorious love.
[time=339] And oh, oh amazing truth to wonder, that he whom angel hosts at end, that this Lord of heaven, God's son would wonder, he became this sinless friend.
[time=364] Through all glorious love of Christ, my Lord divine, that would make him stoop and save the soul of mine.
[time=375] Through all my days and then in heaven above.
[time=382] My soul, my silence never, and I am worshiping him forever and praising for his glorious love.
[time=405] And we'll praise him for his glorious love.
[time=412] We praise you for your glorious love.
[time=434] Everything like that inspires us and we praise the Lord that God has given special abilities to people to use their talents for the Lord.
[time=441] But it makes us all feel like I believe the Lord would love to hear us sing with great enthusiasm and with the confidence that we read the text and these songs and sing them, such as the one we're about to sing.
[time=453] The river glorious is God's perfect peace. Let's lift our voices as we sing him number 402. Like a river glorious, we'll sing the first and the third stanzas together.
[time=483] We praise you for your glorious love.
[time=585] Joining our special guest today, Johnny Hall, is his wife, Terry, and their young son, Adam.
[time=590] We're glad that they're here today too and you'll be able to meet them after the service and the foyer near the record table.
[time=597] If you take your time to meet the entire family, let's anticipate the joy of listening to Johnny Hall again as he comes the minister to us right now.
[time=610] Thank you, Pete. Good morning, everyone.
[time=613] Well, that's great to be here in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=618] I've been here sometimes before. I don't know how many. We were trying to figure that out this morning, but it's always great to come back.
[time=625] Either that means there's a whole new congregation that hadn't heard of Johnny Hall or somebody liked you the time before, so that's always good news.
[time=632] Great to see you all this morning, so thrilled to be able to have my wife and son with me.
[time=636] We don't always get to travel as a family, but it's nice to have them here today.
[time=641] I don't know what your what your have it is on Sunday afternoon.
[time=644] Maybe it's have dinner and then take a nap or whatever.
[time=647] Well, I hope you get up in time to come to our service tonight at six o'clock.
[time=650] We're just going to have a musical presentation tonight sharing the love of the Lord and music and I hope you'll come back.
[time=655] Actually, I'd like to ask you to do one other thing.
[time=658] I'd like to ask you to invite somebody to come with you.
[time=661] I mean, you know, pick up the phone this afternoon and call somebody or talk to a neighbor and invite them to come along.
[time=666] And better than just saying meet me there, go buy and pick them up.
[time=669] You know, if you don't have a car, go borrow Pastor Pete.
[time=672] He's got a whole used car lot at his place and just borrow one of his and go buy and pick him up.
[time=677] And, you know, you might even invite him for a snack or something like that.
[time=681] You know, well, we Christians, we like to eat a lot.
[time=683] So invite him for a snack.
[time=684] And if you don't have enough food, take him over to Pastor Rick's.
[time=686] He's got a whole refrigerator over there.
[time=688] It's full of food.
[time=689] And no, teasing, boy, with us on television, didn't it?
[time=694] We may have a whole lineup at Pastor Rick's today if he will want him food.
[time=698] Oh, well, anyway, just do make a do make a point to come back and join us tonight for our musical concert at six o'clock, right?
[time=705] Great, okay.
[time=706] Well, let's move along with another song.
[time=708] Here we go.
[time=709] [MUSIC - 19 seconds]
[time=732] And He creates a circle that holds all of mankind.
[time=741] And Jesus came with His arms open wide.
[time=750] With His arms open wide.
[time=759] He gave sight to the blinded and in Him we bow.
[time=767] With strong carpenters' hands.
[time=771] He remodeled mankind.
[time=775] Jesus filled with His arms open wide.
[time=784] With His arms open wide.
[time=789] He was nailed to that tree.
[time=793] With His arms open wide.
[time=797] He redeemed the human being.
[time=801] As His last breath was heard.
[time=805] Throughout eternity.
[time=809] Jesus died with His arms open wide.
[time=818] With His arms open wide.
[time=827] Jesus came to this lost world.
[time=831] With His arms open wide.
[time=841] And He created that circle.
[time=846] Reaching all of mankind.
[time=850] And from in that great circle.
[time=853] Stent His word for all time.
[time=857] Just one another.
[time=860] And take the hand of your brother.
[time=864] With your arms open wide.
[time=868] And when we become that circle.
[time=872] Reaching all of mankind.
[time=876] He returned with His arms open wide.
[time=897] Our Lord's coming back.
[time=901] With His arms open wide.
[time=914] Well this is an exciting day for the Blackhawk Baptist Church and for the Bible hour.
[time=919] With our special guest Johnny Hall here.
[time=922] But it's also very special to us that you're joining us and watching our service today.
[time=927] Pete thank you for scheduling Johnny and we're looking forward to having him here for the whole day.
[time=932] Well I've certainly enjoyed his ministry in music and we'll hear him one more time on the Bible hour.
[time=936] But we'd like to encourage those that are watching to come back this evening at 6 p.m. for a full concert.
[time=942] We'll be with us and he'll be able to share his witness and the fact that he loves the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=948] and is using his ability in music to communicate that to the world.
[time=952] So he'll be back with us this evening at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m.
[time=957] Our address is 7321 East State Boulevard here in Fort Wayne.
[time=962] Well I'm looking forward to that and Kathy and I and the children will be lined up early to be in the front for the concert tonight.
[time=969] Many of you know Steve Longbrake because he's been on this brief part of the Bible hour with us before.
[time=974] But Steve is the administrator of our school, Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=978] Steve thank you for rising early to today tell our people about the school.
[time=982] I'm glad to do that.
[time=984] Well we have had a great not just last year the last four or five years have just been tremendous years for our school.
[time=990] As a matter of fact we've taken time a few Sundays to tell you about the school and that's been very very helpful for you and for us.
[time=997] And I understand we have some new students.
[time=999] That's right this year we have new students who have come directly as a result of my having been on the Bible hour.
[time=1006] So I'm glad I have this opportunity.
[time=1008] Well many of you may have students of school age or perhaps even grandchildren and you've often thought about Christian education.
[time=1016] We've asked Steve to come today just to tell you a little bit more about our school.
[time=1020] First of all just a word about the philosophy of Christian education.
[time=1024] Sure I'm really glad to tell you that our school is based on the Bible.
[time=1028] We believe that it's true and our teachers are Christian people who love the Lord and want to commit to Him and to our students what is true about the word.
[time=1038] I hope that as they provide a daily life in front of our kids and also as they integrate it into the different subject matter that they teach that the Lord will come shining through.
[time=1047] I'm sure He does.
[time=1049] The Christian school is committed to a philosophy that's called academic excellence on a biblical foundation and as a father of a student and next year of two students we've certainly found that to be true in our children's lives.
[time=1062] Unfortunately not every class is open some of them are already full but we do have room for more students.
[time=1068] That's right excuse me we have several students several openings available in about eight of our classes so feel free to call us and check out what classes are available.
[time=1078] We'd be happy to answer any questions that you have.
[time=1081] Steve school starts fairly soon people need to act quickly but when is it that school starts?
[time=1087] Our students will start arriving on the 25th of August for one half day of school and then on the 26th they begin for a full day and go the rest of the year.
[time=1095] So really we just have about two weeks of summer left with our children at home and two weeks for you to consider sending your children or perhaps your grandchildren to Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=1106] Steve any final words that you would like to share about the Christian education here?
[time=1111] Yes you know I'd really encourage you to investigate Christian education for your children.
[time=1116] I know it's real and even if I didn't work here I'd want my children to be going here.
[time=1120] I'm thankful for our teachers and their love for the Lord.
[time=1123] Thank you Steve.
[time=1124] Today before we go back to hear Johnny Hall one or two more times and then study God's word I would like to encourage you to write to us for an excellent booklet entitled Tongues.
[time=1135] Those of you who watch the Bible are regularly know that we've been speaking through 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and soon to be in chapters 13 and 14 where the Apostle Paul speaks about this matter of speaking in tongues.
[time=1149] There's a great deal of confusion and I'm sure this booklet won't answer every question but it will answer many of them.
[time=1156] Perhaps more than any other thing people ask about what is the gift of speaking in tongues and is that a gift for today?
[time=1163] You've probably heard me say before that I don't believe that it is a gift for today and we'd like to help you study through the Bible with this insight from Charles Swindall.
[time=1174] If you'll simply write to us today we would be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1178] You can write for this booklet by simply entitling your envelope tongues right to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1191] That's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1198] Thank you again for joining us here today for the Bible hour and we want to encourage you to join us in person tonight.
[time=1205] At six o'clock is Johnny Hall will be ministering in a full concert.
[time=1209] I know it'll be a great time of worship and encouragement.
[time=1212] I hope that you can join us.
[time=1214] Thank you for being a part of this ministry today.
[time=1217] Here's a provocative song.
[time=1226] I'd like to ask you to start with word number one.
[time=1229] Go all the way through it with me.
[time=1231] It might be very, very special for even just one.
[time=1235] I don't understand why some people must suffer.
[time=1243] White children and young people die.
[time=1249] I don't understand how some people have plenty and others.
[time=1260] But just barely goodbye.
[time=1264] Why do new ways of trouble keep pounding against me before yesterday's ways go away?
[time=1280] It's in moments like these.
[time=1284] And my faith seems to falter that Jesus will tenderly whisper and say.
[time=1297] There's a reason.
[time=1301] There's a plan.
[time=1305] There's a purpose.
[time=1308] There's a goal.
[time=1313] And Jesus who loves me more than anyone can.
[time=1321] He is still very much in control.
[time=1337] When tries that I'm leaving don't follow the path that I thought they would take.
[time=1353] When the things I am doing don't make quite the impact that I thought they should make.
[time=1366] When I daily encounter disruption and strife to achieve what the Lord asks of me.
[time=1383] I recall that my God, He's at work in my life using trials to polish His image in me.
[time=1398] There's a reason.
[time=1402] There is a plan.
[time=1407] There's a purpose.
[time=1413] There's a goal.
[time=1415] And there's Jesus who loves you more than anyone can.
[time=1423] He is still very much in control.
[time=1432] There is a reason.
[time=1436] God has a plan.
[time=1440] He has a purpose.
[time=1443] Yes, and He has a goal.
[time=1449] Jesus who loves us more than anyone can.
[time=1461] He is still all my friends.
[time=1465] He is still very much in control.
[time=1477] Jesus is there in control.
[time=1490] Lord Jesus we sense today that you are very much in control.
[time=1503] We would ask you to take control not only of a public worship service, but we would ask
[time=1509] you to take control of each of our hearts.
[time=1512] God, please take control of the heart of that one that today is very fearful.
[time=1518] We would pray today that you would give courage to the heart that is weak for fear.
[time=1524] God, take control of that heart that's bitter.
[time=1527] That life has served them time and time again disappointments and they have not guarded their heart.
[time=1533] Take control of that heart.
[time=1536] God, take control of that heart today that is arrogant.
[time=1542] That sees themselves as the center of all of life.
[time=1548] God, take control, we pray of the heart of that man or woman who is just out of ignorance or out of apathy.
[time=1556] God ignored you and boxed you out of their life.
[time=1561] God, take control of that heart that is rebellious today.
[time=1566] God, we would ask you to take control of the hearts of those who have lost recently, loved ones,
[time=1572] and particularly for Karen Kramer and her mother as her father passed away this morning.
[time=1577] God, take control of their hearts and hold them.
[time=1581] God, we ask you to take control of the heart of Golda Miller as she fights cancer.
[time=1587] We ask you to take control of the heart and mind in the body of Lois Clancy as she battles with diabetes in the failing kidney.
[time=1597] God, we ask you to take control of Marvishland's body as he battles with chronic, reoccurring pancreatitis.
[time=1605] God, we would ask you to take control today in a hospital room as Jeff and Linda Wright's little baby is ill with a respiratory problem and infection.
[time=1615] God, we would ask you to take control today in a home where there is a husband and wife living as partners but totally apart in their heart.
[time=1626] God, we would ask you to take control today where couples have separated over misunderstandings that have escalated to bitterness.
[time=1635] God, we would ask you to take control today of the heart of a father who is rejecting his wife and children.
[time=1644] God, the hurts are so many, but yet we sense that your arms are stretched out and they're open wide.
[time=1651] And so today we've come to first of all worship you, but God, we've come to rest.
[time=1656] So as we give of ourselves and study and worship, God, we ask you to fill our cup and make us whole.
[time=1664] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1669] Without a doubt, the greatest triumph and the greatest tragedy of the modern scientific era was the Challenger Space Shuttle.
[time=1678] And four times that great spacecraft lifted off of its launching pad, orbited to the Earth,
[time=1684] launched satellites and brought astronauts safely home again and again 24 times.
[time=1691] What a great, great triumph.
[time=1694] But nothing has dominated the news more this year than the tragedy that happened last January when that craft, just 73 seconds in this space exploded.
[time=1706] Such tremendous force that in less than one minute after liftoff, it was already achieving over 1,500 miles an hour.
[time=1714] Pure power building straight upward.
[time=1717] Inside that spacecraft, there were over 2,000 sensors and data detectors to towel the space control station.
[time=1725] If anything went wrong in a critical area of that rocket, it could be shut down in milliseconds.
[time=1733] But there was no critical sensor on what we now know to be a rubber o-ring.
[time=1741] Relatively small, though it was as big as those rocket boosters, 37 feet.
[time=1746] It was only a quarter of an inch thick.
[time=1749] One of those little parts you take for granted.
[time=1752] One of those pieces that you think, oh, it's just there, it always works and you don't think of it.
[time=1758] But history records that it was an indispensable part of that rocket.
[time=1766] And the Bible says that you are an indispensable part of the body of Christ.
[time=1773] If any one of us fails to be what God wants us to be, then we're on the brink of a second disaster.
[time=1783] There is no such thing as a dispensable part in rockets or in the body of Christ.
[time=1791] Open your Bibles, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 12, and we're studying today verses 21 through verses 31.
[time=1800] The Apostle Paul wrote in Greek and I can read Greek very, very, very, very slowly and poorly.
[time=1808] I like English.
[time=1811] I like today's English.
[time=1813] I think the King James Bible is a great translation, but I just speak in today's English.
[time=1820] So from time to time, I will use, and today is one of those times, the new international version.
[time=1825] Because I believe it just speaks to us today.
[time=1827] We don't have to have somebody explain what that verb means with that little and clitic ETH on the end of it.
[time=1834] Our words change, and we want to understand God's Word, not just on our traditions.
[time=1840] God gave us His Word that we might know.
[time=1842] And so today from the new international version, chapter 12, verse 21.
[time=1847] The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you," and the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you."
[time=1857] On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
[time=1864] And the parts that we think are less honorable, we treat with special honor.
[time=1870] And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
[time=1876] while our presentable parts need no special treatment.
[time=1881] But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lack it
[time=1889] so that there should be no division in the body.
[time=1894] But that its part should have equal concern for each other.
[time=1899] If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[time=1903] If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
[time=1908] Now you are the body of Christ.
[time=1912] And each one of you is a part of it.
[time=1916] And in the church, God has appointed, first of all, apostles, second prophets, third teachers,
[time=1924] then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others,
[time=1930] those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kind of tongues.
[time=1936] Are all apostles?
[time=1939] Are all prophets?
[time=1942] Are all teachers?
[time=1945] Do all work miracles?
[time=1947] Do all have the gifts of healing?
[time=1950] Do all speaking tongues?
[time=1953] Do all interpret?
[time=1956] But eagerly desire the greater gifts.
[time=1963] And now I will show you a more excellent way.
[time=1969] The Apostle Paul was writing, of course, about spiritual gifts.
[time=1972] We have been studying that for several weeks.
[time=1975] He comes to a word that I have grabbed a hold of because it literally grabbed a hold of me.
[time=1980] The word indispensable.
[time=1982] But today I would like just to give us a brief review so that we keep in context all that we have studied today.
[time=1989] We spent our first week on that first verse that says, "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren,
[time=1995] I would not have you to be ignorant." The Corinthians had a concern.
[time=1999] Their concern was over spiritual gifts.
[time=2001] Who has what gifts?
[time=2002] How do you use them?
[time=2003] How do we use all these gifts in the church?
[time=2005] They penned out some letters and Paul, what do we do?
[time=2009] Paul then responded, he was concerned.
[time=2012] First of all, that they would not remain ignorant.
[time=2015] There are those that want to say, "Don't teach on these difficult areas where there's such disunity.
[time=2021] Just let everybody believe what they believe." But Paul said, "No, I don't want you to be ignorant.
[time=2028] I want to teach you." He was concerned that they not remain ignorant.
[time=2032] But secondly, he was concerned that they would remain brotherly in the way they dealt with spiritual gifts.
[time=2040] And so that's the theme that we're trying to study today.
[time=2043] I've asked you to pray for me.
[time=2045] And I'm praying for you that as we study spiritual gifts that we would always teach.
[time=2050] But we would teach with a kindness one towards another.
[time=2053] There will be those that believe that speaking in tongues is for today.
[time=2061] These we will call non-charismatic most of the time.
[time=2065] These we will call charismatic.
[time=2067] But there will be the inherent danger to start drawing lines.
[time=2071] And then to build on that line of wall and to say, "Well, you're really not part of our ministry." Well, you know, you're really not fitting in with us because you believe wrongly or you believe wrongly.
[time=2082] We've got to determine in our hearts that if a person says, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
[time=2090] And that he died on the cross for our sins.
[time=2093] And we can be born into God's family by faith in him that they are part of the body of Christ.
[time=2098] And they're a brother or a sister.
[time=2100] And we've got to endeavor to maintain the unity of the body in the bond of peace.
[time=2105] So you're praying for me.
[time=2107] And I'm praying for you that we'll honor that commitment.
[time=2111] And so as I began this study, just illustrate that we can't have unity.
[time=2115] I wrote to three friends in this community, pastors of churches, some larger than this, who would believe differently about spiritual gifts.
[time=2123] They would believe that somebody possesses a gift of tongues a day.
[time=2126] We would believe that they do not.
[time=2128] And I could write to that friend and say, "We've been studying for one year through first Corinthians.
[time=2134] We now come to the chapters 12, 13, and 14." And we're studying it.
[time=2139] We're not attacking those who are different.
[time=2141] It's simply a part of a book study.
[time=2143] And we want to commit to you that we'll honor you as a brother.
[time=2146] And if you sense that there's anything we can do, tell us.
[time=2149] You know what those brothers in Christ did?
[time=2151] They wrote back and said, "You know our hearts, and we know yours, and we're brothers in Christ." One of them said, "Let's go to lunch all by." Now you talk about the unity of the Spirit.
[time=2161] I'll tell you, it works.
[time=2164] We don't have to say us, them.
[time=2167] We're part of a body of Christ.
[time=2170] No, I don't believe what they believe on that issue.
[time=2173] No, we probably couldn't throw our churches together every Sunday.
[time=2177] But that doesn't mean we can't come to the Coliseum and say, "We want to bring Jim Dobson to this community and we'll be partners." It doesn't mean we can't go and partnership together and say, "Let's bring Johnny Erickson Todd to this community to minister to handicap and to teach how to build workshops." There can be unity, although we would view differently.
[time=2199] And Paul said, "I'm concerned that you not remain ignorant, but I'm also concerned that you function as brothers and sisters." Well, that was two weeks ago.
[time=2208] Last week I made up a word.
[time=2210] If you went home and looked it up in the dictionary, you probably didn't find it, but it was the word "una diversity." Can you remember that? Because that helps me.
[time=2219] Unity says that we're all one body.
[time=2221] We're intricately related to each other, but diversity says, "You're going to be different than I am." You've got different gifts. You've got a different background.
[time=2229] You've got different interests.
[time=2231] Some people will come to this church and say, "I don't like that church." I believe everything you believe, we sing the same hymns.
[time=2237] "I don't like that church. It's too big." Somebody else will come to this church and say, "Why?" I thought this was a big church.
[time=2244] This is from Atlanta, Georgia, and I was a part of the first Baptist Church, and most of our adult Sunday school classes are bigger than that little Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2252] I'd really like to find a bigger church.
[time=2255] Well, that's just saying we have different backgrounds.
[time=2258] Some would say that we have different interests, and we do.
[time=2262] Some churches have as their main thrust missions, and every time you come to that church, you hear about missions.
[time=2268] Praise God. We believe in missions.
[time=2270] Others will say, "We believe in the ministry of the Christian school, and every time you go to that church, you hear a promotion on the Christian school." Somebody else says, "We believe in television, so we've rearranged everything in our church around television." Beloved, we believe in all of it.
[time=2284] But you may have a different emphasis.
[time=2286] Some of us have different gifts.
[time=2289] I'm going to confess to you that I have faith.
[time=2292] I believe in Christ. I have enough faith to make it through most days.
[time=2296] But I don't have a gift of faith that I just launch out and trust God unreservedly.
[time=2301] I'm a bean counter, you know? You sure are going to make it?
[time=2304] Well, Kathy and I, and the kids were having dinner with another pastor, part of this community and a close friend, and he's an enthusiast.
[time=2312] He is an enthusiast, and every time we talk about the word, he'd jump up and clap his hands and say, "Oh, yes!" Well, he said, "Tell me about your plans to build a church at Blackhawk." And I said, "Well, we've got this gone, and the architect, and we're doing this." And he said, "Well, that's not going to take five or six million." I said, "No, only two and a half, three and a half at the most." He said, "Oh, you've got it!" I wanted to say, "Well, where is it?" You know something that I don't know?
[time=2341] I mean, that was just his gift of faith, and when Oscar speaks, there is an enthusiasm that faith just leaps out of him.
[time=2349] And I come to Poland and say, "Now, beloved." I've got faith, but you better give because I don't know where all that money is that Oscar knows about.
[time=2360] You see, we're different.
[time=2362] We just have different gifts.
[time=2364] You've got different gifts.
[time=2366] And that doesn't mean that you have to go over here because you've got these gifts, and you go over here, and this church will only use these gifts because we like them best.
[time=2374] Unidiversity.
[time=2376] It says that we're one body, but there's diversity of gifts and that we desperately need each other
[time=2382] and that you are needed.
[time=2384] That passage that we read last week ended with that brother, our sister in Christ, who is suffering from a spiritual inferiority complex.
[time=2393] Look it down at verse 15.
[time=2395] If the foot should say, "Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body."
[time=2402] The foot can't say, "Just because I can't do everything the hand can do,
[time=2409] I can't feed the mouth, I can't write, I can't tighten things down with tools, the hand is so much better than me." The foot says, "I just don't count, I'm nothing, the body doesn't need me, I don't exist." Can't say that.
[time=2423] That's inferiority.
[time=2425] But now what we come to in the new passage for today in verse 21, there is superiority.
[time=2431] Here the eye says, "The eye cannot say to the hand, I don't need you." And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you." There are those that think, "My gift, my talent is so important, I don't really need anything else." It's nice that you're all here, but we really don't need you.
[time=2448] Can't say that.
[time=2450] The eye can't say, "I do the reading, I do the seeing, I do the perceiving, I don't really need ears." I'm thankful God has blessed me with good eyes.
[time=2460] I have 20/20 vision.
[time=2461] I can see who's here in the balcony.
[time=2463] Good morning, Steve.
[time=2464] I'm glad you're here today.
[time=2466] I have Hawkeyes.
[time=2467] I can see really well.
[time=2470] But just because I can see, I don't say, "Therefore, I don't need ears.
[time=2474] I don't need to hear anything.
[time=2475] Anything I want to know, I'll just see it.
[time=2477] No, you need ears.
[time=2479] You need ears." You can't look at another part of the body and say, "I don't need you." Verse 22 gives us that key phrase.
[time=2490] On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
[time=2497] Every one of us are needed.
[time=2500] In this passage, he's going to talk about indispensable parts.
[time=2505] He's going to talk about indispensable diversity and then indispensable priorities.
[time=2512] Under this concept of indispensable parts, he first of all identifies there is a mutual need.
[time=2518] That's what we've been talking about here in verses 21, 22, and 23.
[time=2522] There's no part of the body that's dispensable.
[time=2525] But in our American mentality, we've been raised, as Mark Twain called it, with rugged individualism.
[time=2532] Rugged individualism says, "You as that one man or that one woman, you go attack the world and you do it all by yourself." Legends like Daniel Boone.
[time=2544] Remember Daniel Boone?
[time=2545] He led a group of five or six men into Kentucky and they were carving their way through the wilderness.
[time=2551] Everybody else was afraid and went back, but not Daniel Boone.
[time=2556] He conquered the wild frontier all by himself.
[time=2563] George Washington.
[time=2565] Remember the picture of George Washington rowing across the Delaware?
[time=2569] Everybody else is laying down in the boat, hiding George foot up, arm up.
[time=2573] He's striking a pose.
[time=2574] He's taking the British Empire on all by himself.
[time=2577] That's the American mentality.
[time=2579] Do it all yourself.
[time=2581] Don't be dependent on somebody else.
[time=2583] Don't lean on somebody else.
[time=2584] They'll fail you.
[time=2585] Prove you're a real man.
[time=2588] Do it all your own.
[time=2590] As William Henley put it in his classic lines of Inletus, "I care not how straight the gate, how charged with punishment to scroll.
[time=2601] I am the captain of my fate.
[time=2603] I am the captain of my soul." It makes great poetry, but it's lousy living.
[time=2610] We need each other, desperately so.
[time=2614] As John Dunn wrote three centuries ago, "No man is an island." None of us are meant to function alone.
[time=2623] We're indispensable parts, one of another.
[time=2627] You know, there are parts of our body that we pay particular attention to.
[time=2633] You got up this morning, and most of you I trust, brushed your teeth.
[time=2637] Some of you may not have, but most of you did, and we're thankful for that.
[time=2640] And you think about that.
[time=2641] You think about brushing your teeth.
[time=2643] Some of you combed your hair.
[time=2645] Some of you'd like more hair to comb.
[time=2647] But there are parts of the body that we think about all the time, and we take care of it all the time.
[time=2652] There are other parts of the body we never think about until something goes wrong with one of those parts of the body.
[time=2658] Many of you prayed for Dr. Eastland, because you see he has a pancreas that doesn't function right.
[time=2663] How many of you this morning got up and said, "Hmm, let's make sure the old pancreas is working." Didn't do it.
[time=2670] I don't know where a pancreas is.
[time=2671] It's somewhere between your knees and your nose, but I don't know what it does.
[time=2675] I don't even think about that part of the body, do you?
[time=2678] No, but you need it.
[time=2681] Lois's kidneys aren't working.
[time=2683] How many of you today thought, "I better do something to help these kidneys out.
[time=2687] I'm just dependent upon them," and it didn't happen, did it?
[time=2691] But you need those kidneys.
[time=2693] You can't live without them.
[time=2695] They're indispensable parts of the body that we have a mutual need, one for the other.
[time=2701] Even though we don't see them, even though we don't recognize them, even though we aren't even conscious of the way they work, they are indispensable.
[time=2710] Do you know there are indispensable parts of this body that none of us, literally none of us know how they're working?
[time=2718] The power of this church is always, always, the power of prayer.
[time=2725] I know of who some of the people who are faithful in prayer are, but probably the greatest power sources in this church are men and women who humbly and quietly pray, and nobody knows that they're even doing that, but they're indispensable, absolutely indispensable,
[time=2745] and there is a mutual need.
[time=2747] Also, there is mutual respect.
[time=2750] Look at verse 24.
[time=2752] It reads like this.
[time=2754] Actually, verse 23.
[time=2755] And the parts that we think are less honorable, we treat with special honor, and the parts that are unpresentable, we treat with special modesty, while our presentable parts need no special treatment, but God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it.
[time=2775] Now, this passage is talking about mutual respect.
[time=2778] We tend to give great deal of attention to certain parts of the body, particularly the face.
[time=2784] And we talk about the face and we make sure the face looks presentable, but there are other parts of the body that we don't talk about.
[time=2790] We show no respect for that part of the body.
[time=2792] Part of it, for modesty's sake, we cover up, and that's appropriate and our society needs to learn that.
[time=2798] Modesty is a value before God.
[time=2800] But there are parts of the body that we give all the attention to.
[time=2803] We see someone and we talk about how handsome she is, how attractive he is.
[time=2808] When was the last time you heard somebody say, "Boy, I met this guy the other day and you wouldn't believe how good looking he is." I mean, his elbow, I just happened to be standing behind him, and that elbow, I mean, the way that it bent and it moved, what an elbow, what a guy.
[time=2823] Doesn't happen, does it?
[time=2825] We pay no attention to those parts of the body.
[time=2828] When was the last time somebody said, "I saw the most beautiful girl, you wouldn't believe it." Her nasal passages were just perfectly, perfectly formed.
[time=2837] I mean, they were shapely, something about that.
[time=2842] No, those are parts of the body we don't even like to talk about.
[time=2845] I mean, that's kind of crude to talk about that.
[time=2849] It is? Okay, clung those nasal passages up.
[time=2853] Aren't they important? You bet they are.
[time=2856] Although we don't say, "Thank God for that part of the body." Until it doesn't work, then we say, "Thank God for that part of the body." You see, that's mutual respect.
[time=2867] There are parts of our body that require attention.
[time=2870] They require modesty, yet they never receive recognition as really being critically important.
[time=2878] But you know, in the body of Christ, God has placed a completely different value system than we have.
[time=2886] Jesus really zeroed in on that.
[time=2889] In Matthew's chapter 19 and 20, keep your Sunday bulletin, our finger here, and turn back, if you will, to Matthew chapter 19.
[time=2899] In Matthew chapter 19, verse 30, Jesus teaches this principle.
[time=2907] But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.
[time=2916] God's saying, "I'm going to give greater honor to those who in life were given least honor."
[time=2922] And I'm going to take those who were given great honor, and they're not going to be given great honor.
[time=2931] God has a whole new value system.
[time=2935] Look in chapter 20, verse 22, 20, and 23.
[time=2942] It says, verse 20, "Then the mother of Zebedee sons came to Jesus with her sons and kneeling down, asked to favor him.
[time=2951] What is it you want?" he asked.
[time=2953] She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom." You don't know what you're asking Jesus said to them.
[time=2964] "If you drink of the cup that I'm going to drink, we can," they answered.
[time=2968] Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or left is not for me to grant.
[time=2976] These places belong to those whom the Father has been prepared by my Father."
[time=2983] Previously he said, "First, last, first." Now he gives another paradox, and he says this, that greatness is not based on success, but on suffering.
[time=2996] We stand up and we applaud success.
[time=3000] How much is your company grown in this quarter?
[time=3003] How many more people go to your church?
[time=3005] How big is your industry?
[time=3007] How big is your Sunday school class?
[time=3010] God puts a premium not on success, but on suffering.
[time=3015] He said, "Are you able to drink of the cup I'm going to drink?" What was that cup?
[time=3019] Jesus said it when he was about to die.
[time=3021] God let this cup pass from me.
[time=3025] Look at verse 27.
[time=3030] "And whosoever wants to be first must be a slave, just as the son of man did not come
[time=3038] to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."
[time=3044] Look at us based upon servanthood.
[time=3049] You see God looks at the body of Christ, and we applaud this person because they're visible,
[time=3055] and their gifts are visible, and their gifts demand attention.
[time=3060] When we look at this part of the body, we don't even know that they have gifts.
[time=3065] We don't know what those gifts are.
[time=3067] It's no big deal.
[time=3068] God says it is a big deal.
[time=3070] If they're serving, that's more important than if they have honor.
[time=3074] And if they're suffering, that's more important than they have success.
[time=3077] And if they've humbled themselves and become the least among you, that's the one I'm going to make the greatest among you.
[time=3083] That there is mutual need, and there's also mutual respect.
[time=3090] You know, there are those of us.
[time=3092] I'm one of them whose opportunity to serve the body is very, very visible.
[time=3098] It's very, very honorable.
[time=3100] It's a privilege that God has given to me that I do not deserve.
[time=3105] But you know, there are other parts of the body today.
[time=3108] There are no TV cameras today in the newborn nursery.
[time=3112] But there's a group of ladies there today that are changing diapers and wiping bottoms and wiping mouths and then wiping their own shoulder, but they're indispensable.
[time=3127] And you know that if they weren't there today and we brought all of those joyful little
[time=3133] singers into this auditorium, the whole thing would come to a screeching halt.
[time=3138] I mean literally a screeching halt.
[time=3141] They're indispensable.
[time=3143] And we need to respect their gifts and their labor of love as much as we do.
[time=3148] The one that sings or the one that teaches mutual respect.
[time=3153] God says the greatest will be the least and the least will be the greatest.
[time=3157] He's got a whole new value system.
[time=3160] Then he brings up the concept not only of mutual need and mutual respect, but mutual concern.
[time=3166] Verse 25, "Why did God make the body so different?" And this one with seemingly great honor and this one seemingly less honored, but they need each other.
[time=3174] Verse 25, a purpose clause says, "So that there should be no division in the body, but that its part should have equal concern for each other." If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[time=3187] If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
[time=3191] Mutual concern.
[time=3194] Ray Steadman is a great Bible teacher.
[time=3196] He said this, "One day I hurt my wrist and sprained it very badly, and the rest of my body stayed up all night just to keep it company."
[time=3206] That's really true, isn't it?
[time=3208] Our body naturally goes into sympathy and cares for the rest of the body
[time=3214] when one member is afflicted and it suffers right alongside of it.
[time=3220] God says that this body is to go in sympathy with each other so that those of us who lack gifts of faith, we can be built up by those who do have the gift of faith.
[time=3230] For those of us who are a little bit overly zealous can be tempered by the wisdom of those that have the gift of administration.
[time=3236] There are those that have the personality and the gifts of leadership, but there are others who have that gift of helps.
[time=3242] And we simply complement each other.
[time=3244] And when one is weak and more and the other one comes, and with a word of encouragement or a gift of encouragement, picks the other one up, and the body keeps functioning.
[time=3254] We have baskets here.
[time=3256] And one day I was playing basketball with a group of high school students.
[time=3259] I jumped up.
[time=3260] I have a vertical jump of almost six inches.
[time=3262] And I went up for this ball and I came down and my foot landed, lopsided on another young athlete's foot, and that ankle just went like that.
[time=3272] It just folded under me.
[time=3274] Oh, I was in pain.
[time=3276] I went home and got some sympathy, but sympathy wasn't quite enough.
[time=3280] And that night I just couldn't take anymore.
[time=3282] I had to go to the hospital.
[time=3284] As we're driving to the hospital, the ice just wasn't cold enough and it was a cold winter's night.
[time=3290] Kathy was driving and I just rolled out the back down the back window and stuck a barefoot out the window.
[time=3296] And that cold winter snow was hitting it and I want to tell you, it felt wonderful to that foot.
[time=3302] The rest of my body was freezing and the foot said, "Shut up, I need this." (Laughter) One part of the body suffered because the other part of the body needs it.
[time=3315] Sometimes in the church a ministry spends a great deal of time, sometimes a great deal of money in a given area and you sit there and say, "That doesn't mean anything to me." Be gracious.
[time=3327] This part of the body desperately needs that.
[time=3330] You may say, "I wish we would do this." And someday by God's grace I hope we can do it too.
[time=3336] But today this part of the body has a more critical need.
[time=3340] And you see when the body works there becomes mutual concern.
[time=3344] The hands don't say, "Roll up that window, I'm cold." They say the foot has a greater need today and we'll leave that window down.
[time=3352] That's mutual concern.
[time=3354] That's when this person says, "Your part of the ministry is more important than my part of the ministry." Take the time, take the resources that are needed, let's make it work.
[time=3363] And that part says, "Oh, thank you for your generosity." But you know we've all got to grow together.
[time=3370] And so there's a caring and a sharing and a mutual support.
[time=3374] There's no competition between my right hand and my left hand.
[time=3378] There's just support.
[time=3380] And so it's to be in the body of Christ that there's mutual need.
[time=3384] That leads to mutual respect.
[time=3387] That leads to mutual concern.
[time=3389] Because every one of us, you're absolutely indispensable.
[time=3394] You may not be the one that ever stands in front of this great body of people.
[time=3399] But that doesn't mean that you're dispensable.
[time=3403] You could be the very critical rubber o-ring that keeps God's spacecraft moving.
[time=3411] No one is indispensable.
[time=3414] Therefore, don't be inferior and say, "My gifts really aren't needed, they're needed." And whatever you do, don't be superior and say, "Oh, we really don't need that." Yes, we do.
[time=3423] We really do need everybody.
[time=3426] That's a part of the body of Christ functioning and serving.
[time=3431] Secondly, he talks about indispensable diversity.
[time=3436] Verses 27 through 28.
[time=3440] Now you are the body of Christ and each one of you, you're part of it.
[time=3444] First there are apostles, then there are prophets, then there are teachers, then there are other gifts of healing and working of miracles and speaking in tongues.
[time=3454] But he comes back to the fact that there is diversity.
[time=3457] And then the body of Christ, we always have to say unity, diversity, unity, diversity.
[time=3464] And if you'll read this list, it's not the same list as the other list.
[time=3468] Because no matter who you are, no matter what your gifts are, two things are true.
[time=3474] You are important because of the gifts that you have and your uniqueness.
[time=3480] And it is critical that your uniqueness fit into the larger scheme of the whole, the body of Christ.
[time=3487] And the only way that that can happen is when Jesus Christ is the head and he is the Lord.
[time=3493] Is he the head of your life?
[time=3497] That's what's being said here under indispensable.
[time=3501] That it is indispensable before God.
[time=3504] That each of us take our different gifts. This lifts differs than the other list.
[time=3510] They're not the same. Why?
[time=3512] They'll always be somebody who is unique.
[time=3515] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our special musical guest, Johnny Hall,
[time=3526] and the message from God's word from our own pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3530] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3535] Before we close, I'd like to take just a moment and pray with you.
[time=3538] Will you bow your heads and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3549] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3553] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3587] Or use a sermon title in dispensable parts.
[time=3590] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help to free the cost of providing this tape.
