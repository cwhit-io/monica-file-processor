[time=90] People do not care how much we know, until they know how much we care.
[time=111] (dramatic orchestral music) Good morning and welcome to the Bible out with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=120] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of this Lord's Day with us.
[time=124] Today Rick's message is entitled "Gifts Without Grace" taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=130] How much do we care?
[time=132] Spiritual gifts are important, but not as important as spiritual food, particularly the food of love.
[time=137] 1 Corinthians 13 1 through 3 tells us that love is so important that without it our service, sacrifice and suffering are never.
[time=146] Join us today as we study this important passage of God's Word, so that you're able to study with us please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=156] We will be looking at verses 1 through 3.
[time=159] Special music for today's service will be provided by the sanctuary choir, singing a song entitled "Eternal Life" from their new album.
[time=167] We'll also be hearing from our special guest, Keith and star, Prodigal.
[time=171] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Rock Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=176] It is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=180] It is our prayer that the Lord will speak to you through today's message.
[time=184] And now, here's Pastor Rick.
[time=186] We want to share a special word of welcome to our friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=191] We trust that as we worship today, this would be a moment where in the words of Jesus, we could escape the cares of this world, that we could forget about the business deal that didn't quite go together on Friday,
[time=204] or the tension we had in our home last night, or our golf game this afternoon.
[time=210] But at this moment, we could simply focus on the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=214] God loves us, and He wants us to know Him.
[time=218] And after we know Him, He wants to use us to make Him known.
[time=222] He wants us to be His instruments of peace.
[time=225] That's a great message that came from the 11th century.
[time=229] Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
[time=232] It's our privilege today to hear it from our choir in a beautiful musical arrangement.
[time=237] Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
[time=273] Where there is peace when left be so long,
[time=281] where there is injury by love,
[time=288] where there is doubt made,
[time=295] where there is his sin who?
[time=301] Where there is darkness right?
[time=319] O divine master, glad that I may not so much see,
[time=334] to meet the soul as you can tell,
[time=340] to be understood, as you understand,
[time=347] to be loved as you loved,
[time=354] or in years in years,
[time=361] and we will see,
[time=367] in years in our days,
[time=374] and we, we are for them.
[time=381] We, we, we, in the years that we are for them.
[time=397] To eternal life.
[time=404] What a privilege it is to represent our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=423] and be the channels that he fills to witness for him.
[time=426] Let's be that channel of blessing as we sing him number 477.
[time=431] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas 477.
[time=444] All my praise be gracious Savior,
[time=455] that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee,
[time=479] that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and

I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, that I love and all of thee, and suppose I not only have the gift of prophecy, but suppose I have the gift of faith so that I can move mountains.
[time=3225] Now, he's obviously going back to an illustration of Jesus.
[time=3229] Can I share with you that there's not been a recorded, documented, moving of a mountain by faith in the 2000 years since Jesus and Paul said that?
[time=3241] Theoretically, I believe it's true that faith could move a mountain.
[time=3245] However, it's probably Paul's point here saying if I had faith that I could do absolutely anything, even move a mountain, he's again exaggerating.
[time=3255] Finally, he says, suppose I take the gift of helps, I've got the gift of faith, I'm moving mountains, I've got the gift of prophecy, I know everything, I've got the gift of tongues, I can communicate to every person, suppose I have the gift that helps, and I take all that I possess, give it to the poor.
[time=3273] He said all.
[time=3277] He couldn't do that.
[time=3279] You can't give all that you have to the poor, you'd be the poor.
[time=3283] Matter of fact, you can't give the poor everything, you give them all your food, you give them all your water, you won't be here next Sunday.
[time=3291] He's exaggerating.
[time=3293] He says, though I give my body to be burned, that's the ultimate.
[time=3297] He says, these are all exaggerations.
[time=3301] And what he's trying to do by exaggerating it is force us to see that no matter how great our talent, how great our gifts, how superb our abilities, if they're not motivated by love, here's the conclusion.
[time=3317] He gives us a conditional clause, an exaggeration, and then a conclusion.
[time=3323] Well, he says this, if I speak in tongues of men and angels, but I'm not motivated by love, then I am only a resounding gong and a clanging cymbal.
[time=3333] There's a music group that our church just formed called "Celebration" and they practice in our home.
[time=3339] One night they're working on a contemporary song and Brian Zook, who is an excellent drummer, came over and he played his drums.
[time=3345] Ever since then, my son Adam is now a drummer.
[time=3349] He has a little metal can that he turns upside down on the concrete garage floor.
[time=3357] That he beats on with his toy golf club.
[time=3361] It's not the most pleasant of sounds.
[time=3365] I'll come into the garage and say, Adam, what are you doing?
[time=3371] I'm a drummer.
[time=3373] What are you playing? Music.
[time=3375] He's inherited my music ability.
[time=3377] It's just crashing.
[time=3379] It's just beating random noise.
[time=3383] It's just noise pollution.
[time=3385] Paul says, if I have all of the ability to communicate to every person on this globe with the gift of tongue so that they can all hear the gospel and if it's not motivated by love, it's like a three-year-old kid in the garage just beating on a tin can.
[time=3403] It's trash.
[time=3405] It's noise.
[time=3407] It's sound pollution.
[time=3409] It's nothing.
[time=3411] He said, well, what if I have all the knowledge?
[time=3413] What if I know all there is to know?
[time=3415] And it's not motivated by love.
[time=3421] And I have faith that I can move mountains and that's not motivated by love.
[time=3427] He makes the conclusion, I am nothing.
[time=3429] Absolutely nothing.
[time=3433] And then he goes and says, what if I give all that I have to the poor?
[time=3437] Isn't that impressive?
[time=3439] Didn't Jesus say to the rich young really go sell all that you have to the poor?
[time=3443] Then come and follow me and you'll have treasures in heaven.
[time=3447] Was that what I'll get?
[time=3449] If I give all that I have and even my life for the sake of the gospel, won't I have a great reward in heaven?
[time=3455] You may have nothing in heaven.
[time=3457] He just said it, if it's not motivated by love, it is nothing.
[time=3461] I gain nothing.
[time=3465] That brings me to some subtle conclusions.
[time=3469] The first conclusion that it drives me to is this character is more important than ability.
[time=3479] You may have all the abilities in the world, but if you don't have character, it's nothing.
[time=3485] We're very conscious of talent in our society.
[time=3489] God's not nearly as conscious about talent as he is character.
[time=3495] Someone gave me this quote.
[time=3497] Reputation is what people think you are.
[time=3499] Character is what God knows you are.
[time=3503] God knows you today.
[time=3505] Do you know him through Christ?
[time=3507] That's character.
[time=3509] You've been listening to the special music
[time=3524] by our guest, star and Keith Rotagum and the message from God's word from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3530] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3537] Will you pray with me?
[time=3539] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3546] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3549] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3553] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3557] If you've made this decision today, please write to us and we'd like to send you a pamphlet entitled Your Decision to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3567] To receive a copy of Your Decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled Tongues by Charles Swindall, please write to the Bible Hour, Box 15000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3582] To receive a cassette copy of today's sermon, please write and request tape number 1252 or use the sermon title Gifts Without Grace.
[time=3591] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help to free the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3597] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from members of
